                              <span>ssl-termination operates only as a FULL-PROXY and has the advantage of unified certificate management. 
 When HTTP/2 is used, even if the backend (server-side) is h2c, it is impossible to centralize the certificate.
 Does HTTP/2 discard the advantage of certificate workday management? Should I just manage the certificate with CI/CD?

 Can someone give me a direction or snippet from config for FRR?

                              <span>Hello
 I was tasked to migrate 10 legacy asa clusters (versions 7.x-8.x, ASA-50XX) to other vendor while never worked with cisco. No ASDM available.
 As I am understanding it slowly in general, vpns were always something I had least exposure to. Could anyone suggest how to effectively confirm if VPNs are still used on those?
 Currently Im evaluating if vpns are to be migrated or no. Some have vpn configs, others don&#x27;t..So on those where I see it:
 As I understand, seeing live tunnel is best direct evidence of it being used (show vpn-sessiondb)
 In case I do not see it at time of it being established - are there some stats in cli available that would tell me if it was used say last month and how many times? If no stats tied to dates, anything that could help is appreciated.

                              <span>I am working on Ethernet switch on FPGA. I have 8192 MAC addresses, I am trying to create the MAC table by passing them through the 16-bit Hash algorithm. I have a few questions about this;
 I use the hash algorithm result as the address port of the block RAM which I use as the mac table. In this way, I complete the search process in 1 clock cycle, but for the 16-bit HASH algorithm, a very large RAM of 2^16 &#x3D; 65536 addresses is created. Only 8192 addresses of 65536 addresses are used, the rest remains empty. I don&#x27;t know how to do this more efficiently. Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>So in the past few years I have been constantly dealing with super bad quality video courses of software companies in order to get their &quot;tEcHnIcAl CeRtiFiCaTion&quot;.
 Most of them were some sort of backup service, antimalware crap, pentesting stuff like acunetix, you get the idea.
 The other day for example, I had to do a certificate for an anti malware client like kasperski or norton and the company left in multiple retakes of lines he had to do.
 He either had to cough or didn&#x27;t get the pronunciation right and went: &quot;aw damn, gotta do the line again - OK! - bla bla&quot; and went on with the rest of the script.
 I just don&#x27;t get why you would make them so unprofessionally.
 Now I do get that people can be overworked and struggle to get the video out in time, because this might not even be their actual job.
 The company probably had to get the video out in time, but come on man, this is just such a pain to watch and retrieve information from.
 Also what&#x27;s up with non native english speakers putting out english tutorials in shitty english?
 We&#x27;re talking about companies that make literally dozens of millions of buckeroos per year in profit.
 It&#x27;s just so damn of putting. 
 Some sentences sound like questions, but are not questions
 Some sentences are grammatically incorrect
 Some sentences are being mumbled
 Some words are used in the wrong way 
 And don&#x27;t get me started on flashy graphics in the video that don&#x27;t have to do anything with the product itself and the cheesy, soft gitarre music in the background.
 Do you get what I mean? 
 I&#x27;m probably just fed up with having to do these wannabe technical certifications, so that our company get&#x27;s better pricing for said product, but damn... 
 I think I need to look for another job.

 According to docs, this config is stored in WMI as XML
 How to update it when you need to add some changes - new routes or additional aovpn server or something else stored in that $ProfileXML?
 Longer version:
 On first thought easy solution to update XML would be to just remove old CIM instance and then create new but there&#x27;s downside - if there&#x27;s any reason new one won&#x27;t be created (some mistake in config or any other reason) - the connection to this remote device might be lost and we&#x27;ll need to intervene with manual connection to affected workstation or laptop and do the manual troubleshooting, running scripts etc.
 So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for a way to update config instead.

                              <span>I’m realising that most of my news and media consumption isn’t exactly tailored to the world I enjoy living in. So I’m looking to change that with my morning ritual.
 So! All that being said, are there any Daily / Weekly Podcasts, Videos, Newsfeeds you folks Consume Regularly? Specifically I’m a Microsoft guy, so I’m looking for PowerPlatform items, Azure Items, and 365 Items.

                              <span>I have always been good with computers as ive spent a good amount of my life on them, i even tought myself how to code at a basic level. I am 32 now in a dead end job and its always been in my mind that when i have had enough of my job i can get into IT. I have been in the same job for 10 years now earning minimum wage, struggling every month to get by and i cant even tell you why i have done that, i have hated every single day but ive just stuck with it because its the easy option i suppose. 
 To top it off my girlfriend is now pregnant and its hit me, I really need to step up now and get my arse in gear.
 I would love advice on what is the best area to get into, and what i need to learn. I am UK based in Manchester so i would want to obviously work in this area. I truly believe i could pick up anything pretty quickly, I am hungry guys, something has clicked in my head finally.

                              <span>I’m planning on setting up a small development environment at work on a server behind a vpn with no access to the internet. I’ve previously used the built in gateway without a license (becuase lazy) and that has come to haunt me later so im looking to see if there is any alternative for this? 
 The problem is just that i cant use up many IP’s on the range and need a single entry point to a separate lab lan of sorts. 
 Thoughts that have crossed my mind is using Traefik or pfsense and port forwarding but im not sure this is the easier way of doing things. Any suggestions on how to solve it?

 Quick question: do you guys know what GPO disables Windows button / start menu?
 The old Sysadmin disabled this but I want to renable this.
 I&#x27;m checking the RDS Lockdown Policies OU but I can&#x27;t seem to find it. 
 Does anybody know which policy would cause this? 
 Thanks for the help &amp; kind regards!

 We use SCCM. However, SCCM can not perform the post-verification test and send a report. 
 We have 400+ servers and we are verifying manually. So how do we automate this and create a report?
 Ex: AD Server / DHCP /DNS / SQL / APP /IIS /etc etc

 anyone knows if there are any way to manage the visibility for every users calendar? For example we want to be able to see everyones appointments in their calendar and also see the title of the booking - not just the appointment with a &#x27;busy&#x27;-title.

                              <span>Hi, I have an issue where some of my clients (thin clients) connects through the gateway server instead of direct connects. I have enabled the settings Bypass RD Gateway server for local addresses. 
 This problem occurs when connecting from the RDWeb site.
 If I do a direct connection from the RD Client it is working. 
 All my clients are on remote networks connected by VPN so the RDS severs and the clients are on different subnets. 
 DNS lookups is OK, for example I can ping all addresses both by server name and fqdn.
 Also tested to open all ports in the vpn tunnel but the same problem occurs. 
 The strange thing is that not all clients or remote offices have this problem and they are setup identically so I can’t find what is causing this. 
 Any ideas?

Every time I try running the installer, it fails after a few seconds, giving a &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Install&quot; error with error code 0-2054 (0). I have tried uninstalling all other versions of Office from the device, disabled firewall, and after hours of additional troubleshooting, finally resorted to completely wiping the computer and re-installing Windows 10. Even after this, with literally nothing on the computer but a stock Windows 10 install, I get this error. I decided to try installing this on a completely different computer just to test, and sure enough, that one gets the same error. Any idea how I can install the volume license version of Visio successfully?

                              <span>I want to set a new password policy in AD for normal users.
 Currently it is:
  
8 characters
 Expires after half a year
 Complexity required
  
​
 My draft for a new policy:
  
14 characters
 Password does not expire
 No complexity
 Also regular matching with hashes of haveibeenpwned
  
What is my goal? Users should set a secure passphrase once instead of insecure iterations of the same password over and over (password!01, password!02, and so on). The password should only be changed in case of a suspected breach.
 What do you think? I am actually quite convinced not to let passwords expire at all. But in many publications you can still read that they should rotate every 42 days. :|

                              <span>We have a Windows server running a number of scheduled tasks mostly to move files around, upload/download to SFTP, etc...
 Wondering if is is possible to create maintenance windows to prevent schedule tasks launching during scheduled downtime of dependent services i.e. network shares?
 Otherwise I just need to remember to shut the server down, then turn on when scheduled downtime ends.

                              <span>And how did you avoid getting blamed for any issues because the lazy colleague doesn&#x27;t do anything?
 My current issue is, that I am supposed to transition support for an application to a colleague. The colleague has been involved with app support for the past two years. He has made zero contributions to any scripts, processes or improvements. A few months ago I figured out he hasn&#x27;t logged into the app in several months. Now that I am transitioning support to him, he only does support when specifically asked. No insightful questions, or how does XYZ work, or request for meetings to show feature ABC. I am the one who has to chase him to show him how to do things.
 During a critical issue where I was on the call with the vendor, the colleague seemed &quot;Away&quot; in Teams. I told my manager (tactfully) that I need to show my colleague how the issue was resolved, but he is away. Manager just said, &quot;Yes, continue to work with him and let him do the work&quot;.
 I have a feeling this will come back to me some how. I was thinking of keeping a record of all meetings, how-to sessions, meeting invites etc. Later on, if this does come back to me, I will just my manager what was done to transition support.

                              <span>I work with a small business that has ATT fiber and a hosted VoIP phone system. For the last 2 weeks they have experienced issues with their desk phones dropping calls and losing the ability to dial out intermittently throughout the day. No changes were made on this network before these occurrences. 
 We first called the phone vendor and asked them to troubleshoot, they told us that the phones run over the internet so as long as we can confirm internet is stable then the phones should work. They also recommended we call ATT and have them disable their SIP-ALG settings for our circuit. 
 Called ATT and had them disable SIP-ALG, but the problems continued. 
 I should also note that I have sat a full day at this clients office and monitored multiple ping tests to different internal and external devices and never noticed any drops, even when the phones would disconnect.
 This network has only a WatchGuard firewall and a netgear PoE switch in front of the phones, I&#x27;ve replaced both of these devices in hopes that one of them were faulty. Issue still persisted and phones continue to drop.
 Client is pissed, vendors pointing fingers, any suggestions appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I&#x27;m fairly new to the networking world so I apologize if this is a stupid question. I&#x27;ve been asked to set up a network at this medium-sized church and I&#x27;m not quite sure what the best option is. The ISP installed a fiber connection to replace the preexisting DSL. They installed a Cisco 4300 series router and gave us a static IP to use. Because the router belongs to them I can&#x27;t configure it in any way. It doesn&#x27;t have DHCP set up so I have to manually set everything up. The church already had a cisco SG350-28P 28-Port Gigabit PoE Managed Switch that they had connected directly to the Cisco router.
 ​
  
I need to know if it is possible to use the managed switch for routing or if will i need to install another router. 
 If I were to use the switch for routing what would that look like and would it pose security risks?

                              <span>Building two new data centers and current have four ISP&#x27;s planned for each of them. Each ISP is 1G for now and could be upgrading to 10G down the road.. Today our old DC&#x27;s running dual ISP and using ASR1001-X with mem upgraded to 16G with full inet routes. So for each ISP we had an ASR and then peer the two ASR&#x27;s. From there we had 3850X (Stack) setup as core with EIGRP taking the default route only. Idea was just get the traffic to one of the ASR&#x27;s and BGP best path would kick in. Again for the most part it worked pretty well.
 But with us stepping it up to four ISP&#x27;s the old design is just not going to work, we&#x27;ve seem to be maxing out the ASR1001-X with two full tables (which is maxed out at 16G) so this isn&#x27;t going to work.
 So looking for a Edge router that can handle two to four full inet tables. For the core thinking we can just do what we did before as these 3850X should have zero issues with 4G maxed across all four ISP&#x27;s or even 40G if all upgraded to 10G each.
 Or is there something else out we should be looking at for the core switches as well?

 Thanks in advance...

                              <span>I wanted to post a question without getting into the entire topology of my network environment to get people&#x27;s opinions and experiences of what you all have done. We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco&#x27;s iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. 
 I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here? Are route tags the best way to do this, or are community values the standard way to do this?

                              <span>I have a network that has Server 2016 running DHCP, Sophos UTM 9 firewall, 3 Cisco CBS250 switches and Unifi access points. They are running out of IP addresses at this location, and I was wanting to create a new SSID and put it on a different IP range so that users can connect devices to that network and work with their mobile devices and laptops.
 I have setup a VLAN for that the SSID in Unifi and created a new Scope in the DHCP server. I also set the firewall DHCP relay to point to the DHCP server so anything looking for those requests can find that IP range. 
 I have setup something like this a few times in other devices using Unifi but in this current setup I am unfamiliar with Cisco and Sophos. I have figured a lot out by Googling and watching videos but I can’t seem to find this exact scenario that I am trying to recreate. 
 I am wondering if I can just setup the DHCP scope, set the network inside of Unifi with the new IP range and point the DHCP relay to the firewall without using VLAN or if I need to use VLAN how I can get it to function properly across the network.
 Do I have to create a VLAN in the Sophos for this or do I just need to tag the firewall and point the DHCP relay back to the server? Also the switches are Layer 3 which I honestly have never used personally. I have been reading up about them but still unclear how I can utilize the layer 3 in this situation. 
 I hope my post doesn’t get locked this time for being low quality. I hardly ever ask anyone for help when trying to do stuff and figure it out on my own but this one has me over thinking everything.

                              <span>I am designing a hypothetical network for a homework assignment. It is fairly simple thus far, but this question I have is proving more difficult to answer than I expected. I have watched networking educational videos, I&#x27;ve looked for sources, but it seems that my firewall implementation idea is somehow novel, though I am certain it is not. Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. 
 I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment (&quot;star&quot; topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. 
 Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment&#x27;s network usage?
 Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. 
 TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments? What might that look like for security purposes? Same question for application proxy gateways?

                              <span>Hi, we have two buildings, eight units in each building, and we are looking at doing a bulk internet deal for them.
 We are deciding between a line of sight (microwave?) Service with asynchronous up/down speeds vs dedicated modems to each unit via cable provider.
 Both offers are priced similarly and have 5 year contract terms. (4-5% yearly increase in price) The microwave provider is everywhere wireless. They would deploy redundant equipment, backup power supplies, and service equipment. We own it after 7 years. Speeds are 500Mbps or 1 Gbps, but not higher at the moment.
 My question.. I&#x27;m not sure how to evaluate the microwave offering and if it will be superior to the cable modem in each unit. Latency/jitter, etc. What should we consider? I can ask one of their other recent deployments to test their system.
 From a risk perspective, the DOCSIS4 rollout will possibly drive down prices of cable offerings (at least introductory prices), and we&#x27;ll be paying more in three years than we negotiate today.

                              <span>Hello Everyone! Using a Throwaway!
 Thanks for reading! I&#x27;ve been lurking and laughing along with you all for a few months now. I&#x27;m hoping you can give me some advice.
 In the past few years I transitioned from a chef, to an operations manager and sys admin of a commodity trading group. They had some unsecure and inefficient practices, like all users logging into a single email account. I&#x27;m sure you can all imagine some of the other things they came up with.
 Once hired I purchased a domain, and implemented messaging software. This business receives an enormous amount of email and I really enjoyed creating systems that helped them be more aware of what was happening.
 I don&#x27;t anticipate leaving but I am planning on taking courses to help me stay in the field when I need to leave this company.
 Can anyone recommend meaningful courses I can take outside of a degree that could help further my career as a sys admin?
 ​
 Thank you!!!

 Is the there a standard for scripts and code you create? Is is assumed to be the property of your employer?
 I&#x27;m thinking in terms of some unique way in which I might use a block of code, or an entire script or program.
 What&#x27;s the best way to look at this?

 One IT person to another...could also send you a sick throwback Star Wars shirt if that sounds more fun. 
 Just trying to honestly earn 5 minutes to discuss securing your cloud backups. No fluff. Thanks for letting me be persistent.

 Ryan, 
 Few things beat Dr. Pepper. Especially when dealing with late-night system upgrades. 
 Trade you one month&#x27;s supply (3 cases?) for 11 minutes to show you a strategy for making sure your cloud backups are secure? 
 Thanks,Chuck

                              <span>After the panic hit my company had to downsize. During that time I accepted a lot of tasks. After we got over the hump and started growing I was promoted to management and willed myself to hold on to my task, do automation, keep up with new technology, become the one stop shop for Azure. It all came to a head last week and I walked out for a long weekend breather. Quieting my mind I think I have determined I simply cannot be everyone, be an individual contributor, and manage. I have to pick. I think I am going to continue to be a manager, grow my team, and be the muscle that moves the company&#x27;s technology forward.
 I still have the desire to learn Linux, establish powershell 7, get into Ansible, make the assets management system and much more but I guess those days are going to have to be behind me.
 Has this realization come to any of you?

                              <span>Hey guys, So basically I am a developer (front end web and backend) but for years I always messed around with web hosting. Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).
 But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.
 Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.
 Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?
 Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. 
 This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂

                              <span>Well, I might&#x27;ve messed up. I own an HP Envy x360 convertible for private use and apparently set an administrator password for it some day and well, being me, didn&#x27;t document it.
 Whilst I remember the power on password and can therefore still use this thing, the UEFI is out of reach for me.
 Is there any way, at all, to reset the password on a notebook like this, or am I forced to send it in? I&#x27;m no stranger to disassembling laptops, but would like to refrain from anything voiding the warranty (so soldering out EPROMs is out of question, unfortunately).

 In the last two companies, I&#x27;ve worked at I was never in DC. Then talking to a coworker at my new job this company has a lights-out policy where no one is allowed inside the DC except for emergencies or the planned maintenance window on the first weekend of the month. There are security guards at the gate but that is all. Even the operators work remotely. Exciting stuff!

Is there some kind of function in Windows that saves a certificate for a website locally, and uses it by default for a period of time? Is there a timeout that forces Windows to recheck/revalidate the cert on a particular website? and is there a way to force a client to ignore any cached certs and check the cert on the server instead? and what might happen if the client uses a cached cert?

What kind of cool scripts / programs / tools should I look into to demonstrate? I personally want to do a mix of both, where I demonstrate an attack, and then show the steps I would take to mitigate it.

 My concern is that I can&#x27;t find this drive listed anywhere on this website, is this going to be an issue or is the drive going to work just fine?
 Just want to clarify, I&#x27;m not using any HP drives on my system currently, just random ones I found, though those were listed on that website. This is for a home lab, nothing too serious or mission critical.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having this conversation now with a smaller shop. They want to set up a new NAS with RAID syncing to a second NAS at a remote site. They already had a setup like this running with WD Blue HDDs but it&#x27;s almost 10 years old and ready to update. The admin there read he needs &quot;enterprise drives&quot; and I&#x27;m like no you don&#x27;t. They are more than three times the cost of the SSDs in the drive and for this setup way overkill. 
 15-20 years ago when hard drives weren&#x27;t nearly as reliable I&#x27;d more inclined to agree but now not so much. Especially when the place I work at has well over a million SSDs and HDDs in their DCs around the world and all of them are your standard off-the-shelf Western Digitals or Seagates and it&#x27;s running fine.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI.
 I&#x27;d prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped.
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

 I may choose a Dell Mobile Workstation for work. Does anyone have any experience?
 There are two for me to choose from:
 Dell Precision 3570
 Dell Precision 3571
 According to the following ranking, the 3570&#x27;s processor is ranked 47th and the 3571&#x27;s is ranked 1st, but the 3570 has 16GB more RAM (for a total of 32GB). 
 I use the Dell 27&quot; S2721DGFA monitor twice. The 3571&#x27;s graphics card is slightly better than the 3570&#x27;s according to the following ranking.
 No special programs are used. Office, browser, a few VPN clients, anti-virus software, vulnerability scans. I work a lot in the browser. Important for me is a good performance. That&#x27;s it. 
 My questions:
 Which one is better for very fast and reliable &quot;office&quot; work?
 What are the differences between the two?
 Or is it worthwhile to put one together yourself? That would look like this. However, I can&#x27;t find anything about the integrated Intel graphics card GT2 and I don&#x27;t know if it can handle two 27&quot; monitors.
 I am very much looking forward to your feedback and thank you in advance. :)

                              <span>Microsoft have rearranged things, again.
 So if you use site: in your google searches remember to change what you have been used to.
 And any some handy bookmarks you had from before will now give you a 404 page. But at least the 404 page usually gives you a link to the new location. Some old links, but not all, do redirect.
 EDIT: changed bookmark stuff based on u/lanathell&#x27;s feedback.

                              <span>Hi there, apologies if this is not the way to submit here. In our environment (mostly server 2012 r2 and 2016) we have a server that is used by a third party company to run reports. For this they require local admin access. About 6 weeks ago, three of these accounts stopped being able to launch most apps, all except for windows accessories and office 365 apps (fat)
 These users are members of the local admins group, they are also part of an ad group that is also in local admins. Launching any other application gives the error ‘this operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer’
 These accounts are only a problem with this server, it’s the only one they would normally access
 I’ve cleared down the local accounts from there, including the registry. I’ve also just created the default app locker execution rules in group policy. These accounts have full unrestricted access to the server but still can’t launch other applications and services. Unfortunately this includes CMD, so even running a gpresult is proving difficult. Anyone had a similar issue?

                              <span>Hi! I would like to know how you everyone here handles account reviews for VIP employees (in our case CEO). 
 We have to do a review of all accesses in applications in anticipation of an audit. We now take a report of each user and their access. Their managers review the access and tell us if some changes are needed. But the CEO has access to a few applications and we are not sure who should review his access. Someone at the Board? In AD he does not have a anyone set as the Manager.

                              <span>Hi, I work with Microsoft products like Azure, inTune, Dynamics and other 365 products to implement modern workplace solutions for our end users. 
 I find it sometimes difficult to have an overview of all future updates and end of life products that are being pushed by Microsoft. It would be nice to have this automated in some way.
 How do you guys manage this?

                              <span>Hi all
 I started new job, where I will need to do windows server, Azure Vm and VMware host patching
 there are very few servers no WSUS employed or anything else, because they will go away sooner or later 
 my manager asked me about my plan to patch those servers/hosts 
 they are mixes of dev and production 
 I am thinking:
 -Update windows servers when update released (every month) and when critical update is been pushed 
 -Create snapshot for VM before update (is this necessary?)
 -Update VMware server software when new update is released (minor updates for the same version)
 -Update the production servers off hours 
 -Test updates (by running the application and testing all functions)
 -Rollback update if test went wrong
 -For Switches, update one switch after making copy from configurations with old FW
 -Test the switches and be ready to rollback to backup file
 ​
 ​
 is there any ideas or things I need to add to the plan?
 ​
 thanks in advanced

                              <span>I still rock an old ass RRAS VPN on 2003 VM, obviously it has got to go... with that I have few choices, I can pay more for the already expensive barracuda firewalls to I believe give me a decent VPN client + single sign-on, I&#x27;m not sure how I would do 2FA with that but I assume it can do that as it has enough bells &amp; whistles to confuse me anytime I look at it. I also don&#x27;t look forward to deploying the client to my users, I love built-in windows VPN and it always treated me well.
 OR
 just a new 2019 VM with VPN and somehow enable 2FA on that. 
 OR
 the VM + I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying for DUO or something similar either, just not sure how that works to be honest with windows VPN server? can it? 
 what say you /r/sysadmin?

                              <span>I have seen a rash of bogus emails getting through our filters because its being delivered by DocuSign&#x27;s legitimate service/address *.docusign.com, *.docusign.net however the sender will be for example &quot;Chase Bank&quot; with a sender email in the body [00014745billing@outlook.com](mailto:00014745billing@outlook.com). Our users are opening them because they trust the DocuSign domain. The few I have investigated redirected to a 365 sign in when you click &quot;review document&quot; or to a static file with an incoherent message that I presume they are trying to get you to download. So I am assuming malware delivery and credential harvesting. All I can say is thank god for MFA and poorly designed fake documents. However I worry its going to hit the right person where the fake document makes sense, like a plausible contract, and the user actually downloads and opens. 
 Besides education is there a better way to lock this down other then blocking DocuSign and having to manually release.

                              <span>My employer has a presence in most major countries and is very encouraging of sponsoring its remote employees to move wherever they feel suits them best (with an adjustment in pay depending on the destination). 
 I&#x27;m in the US currently and while I&#x27;ve got great health insurance, I&#x27;d love to find somewhere with a sane healthcare system. Having lived somewhere with harsh winters, I&#x27;d prefer not to deal with those anymore. I unfortunately only speak English and have not had luck picking up other languages.
 If you could move somewhere warm and english-speaking-friendly, where would you go?

                              <span>Long story short, it&#x27;s a website meant for employees. But the public internet can access it as well.
 The problem is that they rolled out a update a few months ago where users don&#x27;t need to enter in a password to log in. I discovered this by accident.
 You just need the username, and the system will log you into the account, giving you information such as the employee&#x27;s addresses, contact information, payroll information and so on. Nor is there a &quot;too many attempts&quot; timeout, because I presume that was tied with the password.
 IT department at my office has no idea who to contact to address that issue.
 The website&#x27;s own contact email is never answered. When I called them and waited +3 hours on the line, the help desk person insisted that removing the password was a convince feature, not a …</span>

I could live at the beach, on a mountain, in the city, on a farm... Anyone dealt with this before? Did you move? I would love to lay low for a few years and save cash, but don&#x27;t know if I would dig living in a small town. Just looking for opinions.
 EDIT: I would not be leaving the country or even my state. Just meant changing cities. I live in NC, so I could live at the beach, or the mountains, or stay in Raleigh, or move out into the sticks.

                              <span>Hey all - I&#x27;m trying to verify that our Meraki SD-WAN is actually utilizing the full bandwidth of our 2 500mb circuits and not seeing what I thought I would, so hoping for a suggestion. Doing an internet speed test yields the same result if I take one of the circuits out (approx 500mb up/down). The MX device shows that both circuits are active and it is set to load balance. That said, the device still makes you pick a &#x27;primary&#x27; circuit and seems to be using that one exclusively for my testing.

                              <span>Hi there, I stumbled upon a P2P cli file transfer software named croc (https://github.com/schollz/croc), however there is some terminology in the read-me I couldn&#x27;t quite understand.
 Under the Self-Host Relay section it says:
  
The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections.
  
Now I did find articles on OCSP Stapling but this doesn&#x27;t seem to apply here (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). In a blog post the creator, when talking about how croc works, explains:
  
There are better ways than sequentially uploading and downloading. Instead, you can use a relay server to create a full-duplex real-time communication layer between the two computers so that “uploading” and “downloading” occur simultaneously between the two computers.
  
Which in context sounds a lot like NAT hole punching. Is this just a misuse of the term stapling or is stapling something completely different / nonsense? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Part of a company that has a main server then several departments that are connected via multiple switches and maybe 200m of ethernet cable. Each department has maybe 10-15 computers and multiple machines connected . The networking was done here and there and with different types of cable over the past 10 years. Now things are running slow in one of the departments. We planned to run a new cat6 cable (100m) directly to the main switch. Is it worth it? Is it better to have a fiber cable with a converter on each end between two switches? The main use is transfering small files between computers/machines but during peak hours when most people are connected to the network, stuff stops working well and connections get interrupted

 I have queries regarding the redundancy issue (cisco).
 Scenario: End Customer has Primary-backup set up. I have checked the configuration and found no redundancy protocol is used in it. (sh vrrp , sh glbp, sh standy have no results) .
 My Query
 1) Could the router have redundancy even if the above protocol is not used? (Is it thru the access list? route-map configuration ??)
 2) How to check if both routers are redundant?
 3) if Back to back access is unavailable, Could someone help with the configuration? (no physical cable is connected between both the device to get access to primary via backup or vice versa)

                              <span>For a university project, I built a network of 4 interconnected CISCO switches (2960), with one of them connected to a single router.
 I&#x27;ve defined DCHP pools on the router, and created five VLANs on the switches (using VTP) based on ports. I&#x27;m now trying to assign each DCHP pool to a VLAN, but I can&#x27;t find a solution to do so.
 For example, a user connecting on the port 1 (VLAN 1) would get an IP in the DHCP pool named &quot;VLAN1&quot;.
 Do you have any idea on how I could implement that on these switch?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Bit of background about myself:
  
I&#x27;m a high school student, soon to graduate.
 I&#x27;ve had an interest in Network Engineering for about two years.
 I&#x27;ve developed knowledge in BGP (RPKI filtering &amp; MP-BGP), OSPF (multi-area &amp; summarisation), VPNs (WG &amp; IPsec) and some Network Automation (Python OOP stuff &amp; Drone CI/CD).
 Have picked up some Docker and Linux stuff as well.
  
I&#x27;m starting an internship at a High Frequency Trading Firm in London, with their network team. It&#x27;s likely that they will give me a return offer.
 I&#x27;ve looked into HFT networks and found that multicast is used a lot (to receive market data from exchanges). I&#x27;m planning to set up a multicast IPTV server and run some packet captures to become more familiar with it. Also, I&#x27;ve read whitepapers on the switching platforms that the firm uses.
 Is there anything major to HFT networks I&#x27;m missing?
 I hope this doesn&#x27;t break rule #5, I thought that r/networking would be the best place to ask about such a niche industry.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have this old windows 2012 server (I know, I know), it is configured and responding to an IP on the 10.8.1.x subnet, it is attached to a Cisco switch via cat 5e. It has several nics but only one active (not disabled). The server isn&#x27;t set up with any virtualization. The issue is that the switch is showing 2 Mac addresses coming in on the same port that the server is attached to, arp shows another IP address , associated with a Mac address that is sequentially 1 higher (last digit) than the configured nic on the server, it also has an IP address in the same subnet as the one configured on the server so it would appear as though it would possibly be a secondary port on the nic. The server responds to pings on this secondary IP, nmap scans show only udp 68 being open on this IP. Here is the weird part, the machine doesn&#x27;t show the IP being configured anywhere, ipconfig doesn&#x27;t even list the Mac nor the IP of this secondary IP. Running Wireshark while pinging the secondary IP shows what you would expect from a configured nic, except it isn&#x27;t configured anywhere that I can find...any suggestions on locating where this is coming from would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s imagine three wifi routers close to each other. Two of them (wifi1, wifi2) works on the same channel; the other one (wifi3) works on the channel that overlaps with those two. And let&#x27;s say I have two smartphones (s1, s2), both of them connected to wifi1. When I download something or just scroll through my feed with s1, how do I distinguish those signals that are intended for me if: 
 1) s2 is also downloading
 2) wifi2 and wifi3 works on the same frequency as the wifi1 and other users are also downloading something using those two wifi.

 Essentially we want to build an IoT environment using MQTT as the message protocol. We want to model this environment and simulate the message flow &amp; bandwidth utilization. It&#x27;s a simple publisher &gt; broker &gt; multiple subscribers chain. 
 Our aim is to play around with the values and perform certain what-if scenarios. (e.g if there&#x27;s a message spike, can the bandwidth manage? How long would it take for all my subscribers to receive the payload?) 
 Is there a easy modeling tool that is able to do this? A simple system A sending data to system B. I can vary the bandwidth, payload size and frequency and output the bandwidth utilization

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been using OneNote for my own personal IT notes, specifically networking stuff. If I get shown how to do something, I write up the process. Same if I figure something out for myself, etc. Over 3-4 jobs now I&#x27;ve carried the same OneNote file with me and added to it, but I&#x27;m falling out of love with OneNote.
 I was thinking about an alternative like Evernote, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same simplicity that OneNote has, sadly. If I could import my notes without having to copy-paste everything, I&#x27;d certainly give Evernote a try, but I like to have things organised under tabs (Network, Security, VMware, Wifi, etc) and have my various pages categorised that way. I&#x27;d also need to figure out if Evernote can do this too.
 What do you use for your personal notetaking? What does it do that you like? What does it do that you don&#x27;t like? Thanks for any input to the discussion.

 Client uses a service running on their server to monitor a folder and upload documents to a server over HTTPS.
 Pcap shows handshake looks good, TLS session is negotiated without issue, but once the actual file upload starts, things stop working right. The client will typically send 2-3 packets for any given chunk, but the server only ACKs the first packet. The client then retransmits the next two packets and then gets an ACK for each. So far so good - a bit messy, but at least traffic is flowing.
 Then we get to the very last packet - on the last packet of the session, we end up waiting for 35-40 seconds before we finally get an ACK from the server an…</span>

                              <span>EDIT:UPDATE-my question was answered and pointed in a better direction. Turns out I should have probably posted in a industrial automation sub. Thanks for the info. 
 Are there switches on the market that support RSTP with multiple rings in a switch. I am a design engineer for a BAS manufacturer and the industry is migrating out of rs485 twisted pair to using RSTP compatible switches with a Ring topology to keep costs low on the networking side. For example do switches allow you to set a root and backup port for multiple rings or are you limited to one failover port per switch. I imagine there are a wide range of options based on cost but this would be in the area of 3-5 rings per switch at most for very large networks. 
 To clarify the end goal is to move into An IP friendly physical layer that maintains the cost effectiveness of daisy chains while using ring topology to give a fail over route if the cable is ever damaged/or enough nodes fail we exceed 100m between devices that are online. 
 The current direction looks like a small 8 port industrial switch per network but I grow curious if there could be cost benefit to a single switch 18/24/48 port that could have multiple networks on 1.

Has anyone ever tried to setup two different brands of Firewall brands. One hot and running. Another offline but ready to connect if the first firewall decides to stop working. I know the devil is in the details as far as setting this up but I was wondering if anyone has attempted this.

 The platform advertises an impressive 400gbps of throughput but doesn&#x27;t give any background on where that number comes from. 
 In a layer 3 forwarding application are we really to expect 400gbps of throughput? Does anyone know what the realistic numbers might look like?

 I have one switch where when I SSH to the device I get username and password prompt. After that the connection closes without any indication why. This behaviour happens in SecureCRT and Putty. Console connections works fine. VTY config below looks ok to me but I&#x27;m not sure. Any ideas?

Summary
Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats. 
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Wednesday! Time to get that crap that&#x27;s been bugging you off your chest! In the interests of spicing things up a bit around here, we&#x27;re going to try out a Rant Wednesday thread for you all to vent your frustrations. Feel free to vent about vendors, co-workers, price of scotch or anything else network related. 
 There is no guiding question to help stir up some rage-feels, feel free to fire at will, ranting about anything and everything that&#x27;s been pissing you off or getting on your nerves!
 Note: This post is created at 00:00 UTC. It may not be Wednesday where you are in the world, no need to comment on it.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!
