                              <span>Hello there, Our whole domain infrastructure exists in Azure - virtual machine, virtual network etc. We&#x27;ve got few VPNs set up, to connect to it - one virtual gateway with few address spaces. The issue is, every few days, our local addresses lose connection to virtual network (so the domain). Tried checking basic logs on azure, but there&#x27;s nothing there. Any ideas, what could be causing the problem? Thank you.

 It is no doubt that OpenAI made a breakthrough with GPT-3 and way to go from them honestly, but I&#x27;m getting bugged from the big picture i&#x27;m seeing here, I feel like they&#x27;re hyping things up by introducing GPT-4 and the GPT language is ending up being associated with their name like they own the technology then you start hearing about GPT-5 being in developpement here and there which is like they&#x27;re trying to sell you the next iPhone, and I can&#x27;t help but recall when Microsoft tried to own the internet somehow back then. I&#x27;m all for the advance of technology but I hate when these firms start getting clearly money-driven. what do you think?

 One of the things we need for that is Pin Pads and for most of them we use the company Global Payments.
 And ho boy they have been slowly grinding me down with the amount of crap they pull with me.
 Can&#x27;t share everything, but I have probably over the past few months called them a few dozen times for issues with their garbage products and terrible service.
 Pretty sure at this point in their new trainee manuals, that if they get me on the phone they are to after the call dowse the phone in holy water and burn it, as I am the enraged Devil furious with their shit.
 So a few issues with them :
  
Their support staff don&#x27;t have email. This is one of the biggest issues and one that leaves …</span>

 ​
 I have 5 users out of 2000 on Full Azure AD with never ending issues. Intune isn&#x27;t Enterprise grade yet, but we are being forced to go to it due to Microsoft removing features or making legacy onprem features hard to manage going forward or not adding new features.
 The next low hanging fruit on the issue tracker is Wi-Fi.
 We have 3 Wi-Fi networks.
  
CompanyWifi
 CompanyGuest
 CompanyBYOD
  
How can I block using Intune the ability to connect or see CompanyGuest and CompanyBYOD
 In GPO I just create the profile and add the guest and BYOD to blocked list and click don&#x27;t view blocked wireless networks. I know it works because I have it right now working.
 Even with the CORP profile deployed via Intune it doesn&#x27;t automatically reconnect sometimes and they just see the CompanyNameGUEST and assume its correct. As the GUEST password is on the board room they can connect. 
 They then create support tickets saying network shares, apps and things aren&#x27;t working. The Guest and BYOD are on different VLANS and are blocked from accessing internal resources. I have told them not to connect to Guest or BYOD but ignore me. 
 We have had 25 cases so far this year just from the 5 Full Azure AD users regarding Wi-Fi and not able to access stuff and us finding they are on the wrong Wi-Fi. If we extrapolate that over 1000 odd users, we will get a shit load of tickets.
 This was such a simple thing in Group Policy but looks like moving to Intune and the Modern way is costing us more time for support and costing more money as we now need to licence everything and loosing essential features.

                              <span>Greetings gentlemen and women. I have an old machine in production that is running a UIC machine and the operating system on the computer is dos 6.2
 What is the best way to back it up so that I can see if I can get the software for the machine to run in vdos or dosbox? I don&#x27;t have an idea drive to plug in and use the backup tool in dos. Though does that back up the whole file system and os like a clone, or does it just back up the files?
 I have a star tech USB to IDE reader and have taken the drive and plugged it into win 11 hoping to use macrium and image it. To my chagrin, and what I should have realized, is I guess win 11 will not read fat16 and it says it&#x27;s a 2tb drive that needs to be initialized. Obviously that would wipe the data so that wouldn&#x27;t work.
 Tldr: Need to backup and old dos 6.2 machine and realized that win 11 wouldn&#x27;t read the data. Pls help. I&#x27;m assuming linux would do it, but am unsure how.

                              <span>Here is the situation:
 Router 1  Airmax AC Rocket  Powerbeam AC  Router 2
 I need to send a Q-in-Q link between Router 1 and Router 2. I would &#x27;pack&#x27; the Q-in-Q on Router 1 and Router 2. Airmax devices would only need to transport the Q-in-Q outer VLAn without stripping the inner VLANs.
 Can they do that?
 I know for a fact that Edgeswitch devices, while they can&#x27;t pack Q-in-Q and on paper do not support Q-in-Q. However if you pack the Q-in-Q on two other devices that support Q-in-Q, a Edgeswitch will happily transport the Q-in-Q without issues.

                              <span>Hi all, long time lurker but first time posting.
 I have a Supermicro server with 24 bays and almost exactly half of the drives don&#x27;t work. From the RAID card BIOS they read as 0/00 size, and the card refuses to pass them through to the OS. I&#x27;ve even tried them in my personal rig (LSI-9750) and it spits out a &quot;Not supported&quot; error. I&#x27;ve tried the drives in 3 different servers, with 4 different RAID cards and I&#x27;m at a loss here.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking to see if anyone has had something similar. The most I&#x27;ve found is incompatibility with 520 byte formatted drives but I&#x27;m at a loss here.
 Let me know what you all think, I can post pictures as well if needed.

                              <span>Ninite works great for approved and supported apps, but is there anything for bundling other enterprise applications that are not widely known, or are perhaps even custom, such as powershell deployments, or custom .NET apps?
 I sincerely wish Ninite Pro did this since it has a management interface for remote auditing and management support.

                              <span>So some context. I work at a university with about 200 staff and 600 students. 
 Our IT team is a helpdesk of 4, 3 system and network admins.
 We&#x27;ve got a lot of systems. On top of your basic infrastructure (AD domain controllers, wired network, wireless network, storage servers, virtualization servers, backup and replication, firewall, etc. etc.) we&#x27;re also managing, Microsoft 365 tenant (Azure AD, SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive etc. Loads of admin work with no one dedicated to looking after it all), two MDM platforms for all devices (Jamf for Mac, InTune for Windows machines, again without a dedicated person to look after it), logging and monitoring system, cyber security, and countless other systems and infra that seems to just be growing.
 What&#x27;s it like in your organization? Is there someone who&#x27;s role is to look after specific components of IT, or at least an SME for each component? For a while now it&#x27;s just felt like help desk is running around mad trying to put out fires (users who can&#x27;t connect, machines that dont have correct software, incorrect permissions, general computer issues, etc.) And then the system and network admins just get dragged into helping, meaning that any project work (and there&#x27;s a lot) is borderline impossible to devote attention to

                              <span>We had a bombardment of phishing mails today from a reputable company which passed DKIM and SPF. Turns out they had their SendGrid api, which was IP locked and MFA enabled, hijacked and abused. 
 Not sure if this is a SendGrid problem but some of you may want a heads-up on it.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

I currently have two years and half experience in IT after doing something else for ten years. I also learned most of it on my own. I&#x27;m just feeling bad at the moment. I was fired for not learning fast enough but I felt I had already learned very much. I did notice that u could not find my way in a company with almost zero documentation and where I had to find out everything myself. 
 I passed my CCNA, Ms900 and md100 during the two years. Currently I am working on md101.

                              <span>Good Afternoon,
 I’m hoping someone can guide me in the right direction as we’ve hit a bit of a brick wall.
 We’re using Apple Business Manager &amp; MDM (Microsoft Intune). Within Microsoft Intune we have blocked access for syncing, Apple ID’s and iCloud for regulatory reasons.
 I’ve been asked how to get contacts from an Android device onto an iPhone device, however, after looking almost everywhere it’s either a case of it needing some form of Apple ID/iCloud, it not supporting MDM devices, or it being a contact-by-contact process, which isn’t scalable.
 Does anyone have any form of alternatives?
 Kind Regards,
 Max

                              <span>I&#x27;m in it. Advice is welcome. 
 I&#x27;m moving some devices from a 3rd party print software, I&#x27;ve made the access/nat rules needed, it works for the 800 other devices I&#x27;ve pushed this to.
 The only ones that aren&#x27;t working properly are the fiber locations. I&#x27;ve tried to test from shell using 9100 and it fails. Rules are standard across the board for all 800 locations.
 Does fiber just use a different port for printing?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m out of options here, so I&#x27;d love to pick some brains from people who are wiser than me here. Has anyone else noticed the atrocious behavior of M365 Apps, specifically Outlook, on the Dell Latitude 3500&#x27;s? I&#x27;ve had anything from the application simply not opening, to it disconnecting from exchange, and other spontaneous issues. Everything stays up to date and it seems to only affect our 3500&#x27;s, not our Latitude 5000&#x27;s. The only way solutions I&#x27;ve found are rebuilding the Outlook profile, M365 repairs, and if all else fails a user profile rebuild. 
 I don&#x27;t mind doing my job and fixing these issues, but it&#x27;s getting to the point where I&#x27;m just genuinely having my time wasted with users having the same Outlook issues over and over again. Hell, I&#x27;ve even completely wiped and redeployed a machine and that same issue happened again. Microsoft has been no help and recent updates have done nothing. 
 This is such a simple tier I/II issue that I&#x27;m genuinely just getting my time wasted on. I&#x27;m tired of running a repair or rebuild every two weeks.
 So, basically, have you guys encountered this? If so, have you found any other reliable fixes?
 Also, if you think I should copy this to another sub Reddit, let me know.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had this loose thought in the back of my mind for many many years and never really looked into it as I&#x27;d come to conclusion it was overkill. But I&#x27;m trying to challenge my own assumptions and bias&#x27; more so here goes. 
 I&#x27;ve wondered if we should move the PDC FSMO role to another DC the day before we do maintenance to that server. 
 If it goes wrong you don&#x27;t have to do an AD authoritative restore, just a regular one. If it runs into issues the pressure is off to resolve them. Depending on size of forest it&#x27;s could be more than 1 day.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Had an issue last week after installing the February 2023 update (KB502289) on 4 separate devices running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 that I wanted to pass along, because I haven&#x27;t been able to find any similar issues out there.
 I believe this actually began back in October/November when we started seeing daily incidences of NETLOGON error 5719 (that we only noticed now, in hindsight). A couple of days after installing KB502289, users complained about data shares not being accessible. We noticed that the ACLs on each server weren&#x27;t listing domain members, and that led to figuring out that the secure channel/trust relationship was now broken on each of these servers.
 Tried multiple fixes including:
  
rolling back update KB502289
 Secure Channel repair
 domain unjoin/rejoin
  
None worked, and we ended up just moving the data off of the servers (as we had planned to retire them later this year anyway) and re-creating the shares. We&#x27;re still not 100% certain how this could have been remedied if we were forced to keep the servers in production.
 I&#x27;m fairly certain that this issue was caused in some part due to Netlogon protocol changes/hardening but I can&#x27;t prove it, and I&#x27;m somewhat concerned about how this could end up affecting other servers in our enterprise further down the line. I know this Netlogon hardening is considered a KABOOM so I&#x27;ve been trying to mitigate against issues, but wasn&#x27;t anticipating this one.

                              <span>Hey there,
 ​
 I am trying to figure out a good system to achieve the following design:
 ​
 I have a plethora of clients that give me VPN access to their individual sites. I would like to have my own VPN server on each site, that allows my computer to connect to each site, on demand (not an always-on system) but have it in a reverse connection fashion (so the client does not need to setup port forwarding and IP assignments on their public interface).
 ​
 I was looking into OpenVPN appliance, with a reverse connection policy.
 ​
 Has anybody had a similar scenario they needed to achieve? Thank you for any replies with help.

When I try a password reset a get a message saying self service resets are not enabled and there don&#x27;t seem to be any other options or support contact information.
 I have no Azure knowledge, does anyone know how I can proceed with gaining access to the portal?

 New role: 68k, 20% travel. With multi national company with 10k employees. The role is hardware deployment and upgrades only. With limited access to ticketing system and ect.
 I&#x27;ve been in IT for 6 years + I personally feel like this taking a step backwards. There&#x27;s no room for advancement in new role unless I move out of state. It was made clear that this just hardware role.
 I barely slept, this big decision in my career.
 Thank you for your advice in advance.

 We are an MSP and I have been looking into creating a &quot;baseline&quot; script to apply to all new Office 365 tenants. Essentially, I want to create something that will increase the Security Score (so basically using the Security Score criteria as the guide for the configurations).
 I have been digging around Google, as I assume someone has already done this. However, I have come up empty handed.
 I was just wondering if anyone else has done this? If not, what is your process to ensure all of your managed Office 365 tenants are configured securely?

 so im looking on MS page and every sharepoint test i see has been discontinued, anyone know if they have an updated cert path for that? also dynamics 365? which test to search for?

 EDIT We are a small team, there&#x27;s just myself and the network admin and we are already stretched thin. Trying to tackle this has us both ready to down a bottle of Jack during the work day.
 After purchasing we find out that the quote we got to replace our UTM FULL GUARD doesn&#x27;t contain the email protection so that&#x27;s another 10k we have to pull from budget.
 1) You can&#x27;t just take your config and transfer it, you have to send it to Sophos and they will run some type of voodoo magic to make it compatible. But not all of it.
 2) You have to rebuild all of your firewall r…</span>

                              <span>I have been trying to get my company to understand how inefficient it is to issue a desktop and a laptop to employees who have VPN access. The reality is that they don&#x27;t want to carry a laptop to and from the office so they leave a laptop at home where it never goes online to get application and security updates. Their defense is that they don&#x27;t want employees leaving them in cars on days they don&#x27;t go straight home. They all have Bitlocker enabled and we live in Virginia, it doesn&#x27;t get that hot to melt the laptop. How do you guys handle this?

                              <span>At a previous job we had bitlocker automated, where after a system was imaged it would automatically begin the encryption process and the user would get a pop-up message on the screen saying that they needed to enter a PIN or Passcode. At my current job we have all of the back end stuff working for bitlocker but have to manually enable bitlocker. 
 Does anyone know how to set up this user experience where bitlocker is enabled and to the user they are prompted to create their password? I wasn&#x27;t involved with the development at my old place so am not familiar with what to do. Thanks!

 I’ve got an absolute shoestring budget, and limited external support. We were donated 2 physical servers : totally blank.
 I’m trying to implement the absolute simplest and cheapest solution turn these to vm hosts.
 I was thinking either ESXi or CentOS w/ something like VMware workstation or oracle box.
 I&#x27;d love to hear thoughts and alternatives!

I have noticed that there are some users who will use Edge vs Chrome or vice versa. Whichever browser the user does not use, receives the updates but will scan as being out of date until the browser is launched. I have been looking for policy settings I can use to force the application to update even if not launched but I cannot find anything. Does anyone know how to achieve this?

Now we have requirement to collect dnsdist snmp info as agentx and forward data to main snmp on server, but issue is how we it is gonna end up? like there will be same oid with different infos. Is there any convinient way to handle it without seperating hosts on nagios?

However the Desktop will not redirect and is remaining in the old location. I have verified the old policy does not apply, and is not enforced. The OU I am in is a test OU with inheritance blocked as well. When I run gpresult /v I see that other folder redirects are listed, but there is none for the Desktop. Is there something I am missing?

                              <span>First exposure to recruiters from abroad:
 Approached by a recruiter based in the UK, who found me on a business related social media site. 
 Agreed to talk about the offer: company/role/wage etc. Company is local to me (not UK)
 After our talk he sen&#x27;t me an e-mail wanting me to reply by copy-pasting a text he appended:
 &quot;I, {my name} confirm that {recruiter name} of {recruiter company} has discussed the role of {job title} at {company they want to refer me to} and confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative.
 I understand {recruiter company} are passing my basic details and CV to {company they want to refer me to} on my behalf and are doing so with my express agreement. The Data Privacy and Retention Policy of {company they want to refer me to} is available from {link to company they want to refer me to} {company they want to refer me to}.&quot;
 ​
  
The &quot;confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative&quot; + no time limit for how long is fishy to me. If it were only for the company he&#x27;s selling me to, I wouldn&#x27;t really mind though.
 But is it really meant that way? What if I don&#x27;t accept the role? Would I need to terminate the contract with him/them being my sole representative?
 The link goes to the homepage of {company they want to refer me to}, where I couldn&#x27;t find the Data Retention Policy. I can understand why they need to refer to the {company they want to refer me to}&#x27;s Data Retention policy, since they send my CV over, but wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to link to the {recruiter company} Data Privacy and Retention Policy? Or both?
  
Is this BS? Am I being overly cautious? 
 Thank you

 How do people keep records/create logs for any changes made within IT?
 Is there an open source bit of software that can be used or anything?

 One time I was asked to resolve every event log error in the windows server estate
 Now I Laugh about how futile that was and wondered who had come up with the idea and why my time could not have been spent in a more useful way, I guess I was a very cheap resource 😂

                              <span>Hi everyone. We have a request from a client to find a solution that does BOTH patch management (Microsoft patches but also 3rd party apps patches) and vulnerability scanning for about 500 pcs. So far the only thing that I could find that does these things is Languard, but after a few days of testing the trial I&#x27;m not confident to recommend this. It&#x27;s very slow, freezes a lot, agent deployment does not work 99% of the time, looks very dated, etc.
 I really liked Rapid 7&#x27;s Insight VM for vulnerability assessment but this doesn&#x27;t do patch management and the client doesn&#x27;t want 2 sepparate apps... There&#x27;s also Qualys that would work and I like it, but they have huge prices, it&#x27;s enterprise level solution.
 So, in a nutshell, do you know of any solution that can do what I need and doesn&#x27;t cost my weight in gold? 
 Thank you!

 As someone who is not experienced with AD, if we set a rule that denies users/computers from changing their domain or reverting to a workgroup. is it possible to move these users to a different domain if all of our domain controllers fail?

 https://i.ibb.co/SXnxSdW/pk.jpg
 Have you seen this before?
 Maybe a problem on the adminsdholder, since I have another alert concerning it? (I tried to reset the permissions on the adminsdholder, without success).
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi! I recently noticed that in Windows 11 start menu, folders are only shown when there are at least two items in the folder. If you have a folder that you have added to %appdata%\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs And the folder only have 1 item, the item will be shown ”normal” in the startmenu. However, the folder will still be shown in %appdata%\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs 
 Is there any register value to change the ”minimum item in start menu folder”?

 ​
 I discovered Z-push a while ago, in every documentation I find it talks about integration with Zimbra. 
 ​
 In my case I have a server with Directadmin and exim with more than 10k mail accounts running and I would like to know if it can be integrated with my system without having to migrate everything to Zimbra.
 ​
 I also have a CalDav and CardDav server running, so I understand that it could be configured for z-push to use both servers.
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey guys, really stuck here. We use different gens of Surface Devices in our domain, mainly Book 2 and Surface Pro 7/8 - since approx. January people complain about not beeing able to share their screen. This only happens solely on Surface pro 7. You plug in the usb dongle, click the .exe on the usb share but nothing happens.
 Funny sidenote: it works with all guest devices, it works with our lenovo notebooks, it works with surface book 2, only about 30 Surface Pro 7 dont work.
 We use CS-100 and CS-200 and appropiate Clickshare Buttons, all on the latest firmware.Windows Version is 20H2, soon 22H2 on all machines, also no GPO that prevents USB since it works on all other devices. We are really struggling atm - no eventlog nor barco log show problems. We tried deleting local profiles, we downgraded firmware...
 Does anyone experience the same?

                              <span>We have a distribution list with 10 external contacts (customer). 
 They were doing a reply all and it was blocked by our mail security so I allowed their domain to relay which helped but now it is blocked by their own mail security as it is mail to themselves originating from an IP that does not belong to them. I guess they can allow our IP to send mail as them? but is there a better way to do this? I feel we should not be bypassing security and making exceptions.

                              <span>Looking for some tips and advice and maybe others are sturgling with the same problem.
 All our users have a laptop with always on vpn. We split tunnel some stuff like teams/onedrive to not kill our internet connection. Normal web traffic goes trough the vpn and firewall rules.
 Lately we are detecting large amount of traffic from alot of windows 10 laptops to some ip bloks. Mostly 8.238.22.x, 8.238.23.x, 8.238.177.x, 8.238.179.x and 152.199.21.x ranges. It show as port 80 webtraffic and they are big data blocks and causes our internet connection to clog up. Also we are europe based and the ip blocks seem to be from usa. (nsa stop spying!!! :p ) We can kill it with firewall rules but we need to get to the source of this.
 Stuf we tried/considerd.
  
It all started pretty much at the same time and only are win10 laptops.
 Checked if we missed ip block update from microsoft but that is not the case.
 Tried to find something about the ip&#x27;s but can not find anything more than Level 3 communications.
 Ran malware bytes on laptops confirmed they had this problem and nothing found
 When a range is blocked at some point the laptop stops trying to connect.
  
Anny and all tips would be very welcome. At the moment I am trying to get my hands on a laptop that showing this so i can try to see if I can get the proces with netstat but at the moment no luck.

                              <span>So for the longest time I have been terrible at linking a title with something - this goes for anything, examples such as:
 - Names for people
 - Titles for subjects
 - Area names like street names, site areas, ect...
 I am generally quite intelligent and managed to get by with this limitation as although I struggle with the titles, the knowledge I pick up quite quickly. However, as an IT apprentice this has been effecting me more and more, especially for my portfolio.
 For my portfolio I have to fill out a KSB table (Knowledge Skills and Behaviours) where I have met each topic, e.g. applying the appropriate skills/techniques for secure working. Every time I go to look at it I feel a little overwhelmed and not sure where to start due to this weakness. 
 Moreover, when providing on site support, as I am first/second line support, it can be difficult for me knowing where things are. Although I know where users are as I have learned their names after being there a while, if someone says one of the clock in machines isn&#x27;t working I have to get them to describe where rather than just saying the area name.
 I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure where on reddit to ask this, so if there is a better place please advise me :) However, I thought this would be a good place as my issues are effecting my ability in my career and I am sure someone else has likely experienced this.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 So I&#x27;m looking into an issue with a few surface pro 9s where the on screen keyboard doesn&#x27;t auto appear even when there&#x27;s no typercover or keyboard attached. It doesn&#x27;t even seem to detect tablet mode. I&#x27;ve tried playing about with all the settings that should enable the touch keyboard but don&#x27;t know what else to try. 
 ​
 Has anyone had this issue before and managed to fix it? The machines were built with SCCM so maybe it could be an issue with the image, GPOs or something in the task sequence.

 I can manually input a mobile number into AzureAD, even though the field should be greyed out. I thought ActiveDirectory had lost authority over AzureAD but our MSP has said there&#x27;s a &quot;Microsoft bug&quot;. Anyone else aware of this?

                              <span>we are running a proof of concept on Microsoft teams through a Citrix VDI environment using the teams machine wide installer that installs in c program files that seems to lack features over the full version. Citrix hdx optimized is working and we are on the latest version.
 we are experiencing intermittent issues with users getting kicked out of calls, webcam quality poor or not working, no noise cancellation so can hear dogs barking and keyboards. 
 Going to be hard getting people to want to use this as the last 3 years they have been using a well known cloud based video conferencing tool features like noise cancellation however we are paying for e3 e5 office 365 licences and suspect that is our path forward
 Just wondering if anyone else has been in the same position, fielding why is teams so crap through citrix questions etc and has any advice, feedback, suggestions. If you have been in this position what was the outcome?

 ​
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on AD DS machine. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 My question is : Has anyone had any problems after changing this hardening?
 thanks,

 Vulnerability :
 ​
 Description 
 ​
 When non-privileged users can link GPOs at the Domain Controllers OU level, they havetheability to effect change on domain controllers as well as potentially elevate access and change domain-wide security posture. This indicator looks for non-default principals who have write permissions on the GPLink attribute or Write DACL/Write Owner on the object. Likelihood of Compromise Just being able to link GPOs doesn&#x27;t provide the whole picture. An attacker would need to find or edit a GPO that contains the instructions they want to achieve. However, i fan attacker can find an existing GPO that meets their needs, then having this write permission gives them thekeys to the kingdom. Result Found 1 objects with write permissions on the GPLink attributeat the Domain Controller OU level. OU&#x3D;Domain Controllers CONTOSO\Enterprise Key Admins Allow: Generic All on: All Properties DC&#x3D;contoso,DC&#x3D;local Allow: Generic All on: All Properties contoso\Enterprise Key Admins

 Now I have a 2012 R2 server in which the patch level is at 2023-02 rollup patch. I thought that if I try to install the 2022-01 monthly rollup patch, it will give an error that says &quot;update not applicable&quot; since a latest monthly rollup patch is already installed - but for some reason it did not and I was still able to install the old patch.
 ​
 Would there be any changes in terms of security by installing a much older patch? I now wonder what changes would there be by installing an older patch?

                              <span>Hey folks, I’m one of the devs behind Netdata, a free tool that lets you keep an eye on your servers and apps. I wrote a blog post about how to monitor Windows Server like a pro, what to look out for, what to measure and so on. It’s based on my own experience and some research I did. Here’s the link: https://www.netdata.cloud/windows-monitoring/ 
 ​
 I’d really appreciate your feedback on the post and the tool. Do you think it covers all the bases for Windows Server monitoring? What are some of the headaches or issues you run into when dealing with Windows servers? What would make Netdata more awesome for you and other users? I’m not trying to sell or spam anything here. I just want to learn from your insights and suggestions so that I can improve Netdata for you and others. Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts.

                              <span>Good morning all,
 ​
 I&#x27;ve got my SC-200 this Friday, previously attempted it and failed by 1 or 2 marks, I got 684 and needed 700 :(
 ​
 Work gave me a 2nd exam voucher and I realised we also have access to measure-up for free so I&#x27;ve been going through the 117 Qs they have but am I better using exam dumps? Measure-up offer money back guarantees if you can hit 90% in succession (confident I can do this easily with practice) but would I be better spending my time on the exam dumps instead? 
 For dumps my colleague recommended Prof-IT (work subsidised buying this so I have access to both options).
 Overall I find Measure-up better personally in terms of interaction/gui/features.
 ​
 Any thoughts welcome.

                              <span>Hi 
 We are a small MSP who seem to run into problems, when we are experiencing more complicated issues with our customers&#x27; different copiers. These are issues that seems to relate to their drivers and the interaction with the rest of the network/print server ecosystem. 
 Our experience when contacting the different Copier/Printer suppliers is mostly rejections saying that the issue is with our systems - e.g. once we had a technician connect a laptop directly to the ethernet port on a copier, print a page and conclude that there was not a problem printing to their device. While I can understand the technician&#x27;s point of view, in regards to his domain with technical support of the copier itself, I am guessing it is fairly few organizations who buy a copier for one person to connect directly to it via ethernet cable.
 Other times they will say we can only use one specific driver without further explanation, even though their own company supplies both Universal and PCL and PS variants.
 We try of course to be diligent in our testing and problem solving, but when we cannot find fault in our systems, we need somebody to turn to. It seems it is very hard to get the suppliers of Copiers/Printers to take what seems to be issues with their drivers and the interaction with other IT systems seriously?
 So I am asking for advice on how you handle issues with copiers, where you have tested different configurations in regards to network, server setup and drivers with no luck
  
Do you buy special support from the copier/printer manufacturers?
 Do you have a secret hotline?
 Any other tips?
  
Thank you!

 I have a fresh installation of Windows 10 Pro, which I installed chrome on when I first set it up. Today I powered up the VM and as a normal thing I do I deleted the chrome shortcut from my desktop, but this time a windows alert pop up showed on the left, beside the start menu asking if I wanted to try Edge instead of chrome.
 I&#x27;ve never seen this particular pop up before, only when changing default browser, never when deleting the chrome icon.
 Anyone else seen this?

                              <span>Hej,
 is it possible to have following setup: 
 serverA with
 Roundcube
 ManagedSieve plugin by Dovecot / Pigeonhole 
 serverB with
 Mailboxes
 Postfix 
 All postboxes are on serverB, unfortunalty they can be migrated yet to other system and on serverB no webmail is possible. So I would like to use serverA with rounducbe, IMAP&amp;SMTP connections are working fine but also I want to use the filter options in rounducbe, so a managedSieve is needed. Can I set it up on the local roundcube?
 So e.g. the local Sieve in manageing the filter option if set up in roundcube, like thunderbird would do it? 
 Currently I just get a timeout or couldn&#x27;t connect to managedSieve server and I wonder if this is even possible or not.

                              <span>My organization is entirely on-premise (AD, ADFS, domain clients).
 ​
 As I understand, it is entirely possible to configure on-premise only WHFB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-cert-trust-adfs
 ​
 My question is -
  
Once I enable ADFS as the CRA, and configure DNS for device registration - who/which devices will be prompted to register?
 Can I allow/enforce registration only for domain-joined devices, and all other devices will just authenticate as usual without using WHFB?
  
​
 I&#x27;m trying to &#x27;allow&#x27; WHFB in my organization, but not to &#x27;enforce it&#x27;.
 Because not everyone who will authenticate against my ADFS are using a domain-joined laptop.
 We want to allow WFHB for domain-joined corporate devices, while those logging in from their personal devices (non-domain joined or even joined to someone else&#x27;s AAD) are not prompted to register (since the registration would fail, as we are on-prem only).
 ​
 i.e. if you try to access https://intranet from a domain device, you are prompted to register/use WHFB
 if you try to access https://intranet from a personal non-domain device, you are not prompted to register and can just use &#x27;regular login&#x27;

                              <span>Hi, I have some users that are local admins on their laptops and some that are not. Does anybody know if it makes a difference when installing Admin by request, if the end user is a local admin or not? Does the software still work the same in either case or should I make all users either standard or local admin first before installing?
 EDIT: I have just thought why my question does make sense
 I was told to install the software onto my domain laptops in a kind of monitoring mode before enabling &#x27;Require Approval &#x3D; ON&#x27;, but if that then makes all my standard users local admins this is not good.
 So, if Admin by request is installed on to a stanadrd users account and I then leave it in moniotor mode, which is,
 Allow run as admin &#x3D; on
 Require Approval &#x3D; off
 Does this kind of make all standard users local admin users until approval is enabled?

                              <span>im looking primarily for what specs/protocols I need to get a switch to push a vlan to an ip phone/by oui and or be able to have the phones second port(switch port) be on a different vlan.
 back story: I inherited a situation with about 40 Polycom vvx-501 and tds managed ip hosting. They have two cisco 2960xs and a cisco router.
 we own the phones and are looking to move to a new provider. Our budget is tight and the ceo hates spending on networking. I noticed if we let the new provider lease us switches we end up paying $4200 over 5 years for two Extreme networks 210-24 port units that we dont get to keep at the end.
 for that price I figured we might as well get an aruba instant on 1960 48 port poe version. Then eventually another 48 port non poe. then I can roll out some of the POE thin…</span>

                              <span>Hello folks, my company plan to purchase almost 1000 Access Points and controllers for our distributed network. We prefer on prem products for controllers. As APs we don’t think its a good time to switch to WiFi 6E so we prefer WiFi 6. We are Cisco shop but there is a problem with their shipment date, 400 days last time i asked them. Also they are not giving much discount even with a big purchase. So we look into other vendors like Aruba, Extreme and Huawei. So for those who worked with multiple of those vendors how do you compare them?

 We currently use Lumen, formerly CenturyLink. Our experience with them has never been sticker worthy and it continues to worsen. We would like to start moving a different direction but I would like to see recommendations from others.
 Who do you use, or have used in the past, that was actually great to deal with. It actually wouldn&#x27;t hurt to know which companies to stay away from as well.

                              <span>I have two Cisco routers configured the same with the same server. For some reason one of the routers has no packets coming in or out. It&#x27;s not communicating with the server at all. Everything between both routers are the same, just one does not want to work. I have checked if anything is different between the two, but there&#x27;s nothing different in the SNMP config. The server is pingable. Anyone have any idea what would be causing no packets to go in/out.

                              <span>I am having trouble with a laptop wireless connection to an Epson projector. Originally, both the laptop and projector were connected to the office network over the same ssid at the main router. The projector is assigned a static IP address, which allows the laptop to connect to it over the router. However, something is causing a huge amount of lag in the connection. The router appears to be working fine for all other devices, however for the projector connection there is tremendous lag at times. My solution for this was to purchase a wireless access point. So now I am trying to connect the projector to the network through the access point (with a different ssid) while the laptop remains on the main ssid. In this configuration the laptop cannot find the projector. The projector successfully connects to the network with its static IP, however on the laptop side it can’t be found. I thought that as long as the projector IP remained the same, it would not matter how the projector connects to the network for it to communicate with the laptop. What am I missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m noticing reach-ability to 4.2.2.3 has significant packet loss, starting around 3/12, anyone else notice the same. Its one of 2 locations we use for verifying internet connectivity, other destinations aren&#x27;t seeing similar issues. Doesn&#x27;t appear i can attach a log but its clean and available (more or less forever) and started consistently having issues up/down losses with aprox 16-17% packet losses. Edit - 4.2.2.3.
 ​
 Also just to provide clarity we test with 1 ICMP per 60 seconds, nothing terribly overwhelming, I wouldn&#x27;t imagine we&#x27;d hit any kind of DDOS threshold.

When I enable Certificate authentication, it asks to upload &quot;Client Certificate CA&quot;. (Step 7. Upload the Client Certificate CA certificate used to sign the client certificate in a form of a PEM or DER file.) What exactly is this cert? is it a root cert from our internal CA? I am not all that familiar with certs so wanted to clarify. https://documentation.meraki.com/MR/Encryption_and_Authentication/Meraki_Local_Authentication_-_MR_802.1X

                              <span>I am an entry level network engineer and being assigned to play with nokia sas despite having knowledge only on cisco r&amp;s gears. I tried to make a dynamic route between the devices&#x27; fiber ports but somehow it wont work. Logs are flapping between exchange and down and the reason is too many transmissions. I searched in the internet and the solution I only find is MTU mismatch or MTU misconfig. I tried to fix this problem but the adjacency still doesnt form and logs are still flapping between exchange and down. What do you think is the reason behind this? This is my first time handling inter-vendor routing. Thank you.

                              <span>I am about to use Eve NG with the Windows Server either 2019 or 2022.
 I have a i9 13900KS 24 Cores.
 I will upgrade it to 128 GB of RAM.
 I have about 3 TB of a external SATA I want to use.
 As far as RAM and processing power, to have a enterprise environment running with switches , routers, firewall and clients. That should be more than enough RAM to push through?
 I know it depends on how large the environment is , but realistically just to have enough power for run at least a moderate enterprise environment with the listed above?

                              <span>Given the following scenario: 
 -VLAN 100 with a DHCP scope with 8h lease time
 -VLAN 200 with a DHCP scope with 8h lease time
 -Accesspoint in bridge mode with ~ 30 clients on a switch port with untagged VLAN 100
 ​
 -&gt; The AP is putting clients in the VLAN 100 where they get a DHCP address. So far so good.
 -&gt; When I change the vlan to VLAN 200 untagged on the switch port, all clients immediatly ask for a new DHCP address and get an address in the VLAN 200 DHCP scope. 
 -&gt; My questions are: Why is this the case? The lease time is 8 hours, so shouldn&#x27;t the clients at least keep the address for 4h before asking for a new one? Or has this something to do with the clients not being able to reach their gateway in VLAN 100 anymore and therefore asking for a new address?

 ​
 Can someone help with configuring Extreme AP410 via the cli. I need to configure wi-fi with authorization indication using WPA Enterprise specifying AAA radius. And also please explain how you can configure the vlan for a specific ssid. For example, I want the ssid &quot;test_vlan_100&quot; to be accessed in vlan 100.
 ​
 Thanks for any help.

                              <span>I have been working in IT for well over a decade, almost all of it being help desk. My current role is a mid-tier system engineer role for almost a year. Most of what I do is user account management, a little data center support, exchange 2010, shared drive access management, airwatch/WS1, and some other light system duties. I am very interested in endpoint engineering with O365, Intune, SCCM, Exchange Online, and Azure.
 I have done some work in O365 and Intune from a help desk role a couple jobs ago. My current company will be migrating to O365 later this year, with me being part of the migration.
 A friend recommended a powershell book and I started building scripts for some exchange tasks.
 I haven&#x27;t used SCCM itself, I used KACE and Empirum. I reached out to one of the engineers to show me SCCM and she&#x27;s going to let me shadow her for software packaging and pushes.
 Besides just shadowing others, what are some resources I can watch, learn, and do myself to get a jump start? My job has plenty of downtime and I want to fill that time to learn more things.

                              <span>I am splitting up my flat network into 3 zones, A, B and C all with a firewall in between. Zone A will house ICS, Zone B will house servers and Zone C will house users. Currently I have 2 domain controllers that mirror each other on the flat network. A handful of users will need to authenticate across all 3 zones.
 What should I do with the domain controller to keep it secure. Should I keep it in the user zone and place read-only DCs in the other zones? Should I keep it the servers zone and setup DCs in the 2 other zones with one-way trusts? Should I setup stand alone DCs in all 3 zones and create those user accounts accounts the 3 DCs? My paranoia is that if my one DC gets compromised then users can&#x27;t log into the 3 zones. My ICS zone needs to be the most secure.

 I have used it very sparingly - basically finding a script online and just changing the options.
 Basically starting at zero.

                              <span>Hi,
 i work in IT support of a Company with around 4500 employees - the default Smartphones we hand out are Samsung A53s 5G.
 So recently an employee left the company and we got a like-new A53 with Android 13 back to hand out to the next user.
 He did a factory reset but didnt remove his google account - so we cant access the device. Even a factory reset via recovery mode doesnt help. The phone always ask&#x27;s for the last registered google acc.
 Does anyone of you have an idea how to bypass Samsung&#x27;s FRP? I would prefer solutions without sussy external software.
 I saw some youtube videos how a guy accessed bixby with talkback (Android 12). Via bixby you can access some stuff like browser or settings... but it seems like this has been fixed with Android 13 - i at least could not make it work.
 Thanks for your ideas/solutions!

 I have inherited a group that truly &#x27;means well, however their soft skills are sub par. They are receptive to self improvement. I would like to find someone to teach my guys some methods to provide the best support possible.
 The positions of this team are all over the board... literally the entire IT department. 
 All suggestions, opinions, feedback are welcomed. Thanks!

                              <span>Left my SysAdmin job last year for burnout. A colleague who went on to become CTO of an ecomm company reached out in Feb to check in on me and see if I was open to some contract work. 
 I’m sick of spending my savings so I said yes. 
 Essentially, they fired their old head of ops because of a massive crash around Valentine’s Day. 
 The CTO wants me to come in and basically rebuild the department in the image of the company where we worked at together. 
 There’s 2 other junior IT people I’ll have at my disposal who I will be training up. 
 If everything goes good, there’s the potential to stay on or if I don’t want to, the pay will allow me to take some more time off. 
 Any tips on scoping this out and making good? Mistakes to avoid?

 I work for software company that has multiple software products. Each team that works with each product is kind of like their own company, in a way. Anyhow, a large corporation recently acquired about 5/8 of these software products and all of the employees working with these software products have all had to join this corporation. The rest of the company stayed behind. One of these individuals who worked for the part of the company that got acquired was our sysadmin. He had been the system admin for several years and by the looks of it, documented nothing. There are no procedures, processes or anything anywhere. Nothing. The server room is a disaster, no cable management, a ball of cables the size of a small vehicle in the middle of the room and a huge disintegrating b…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I wanted to see if any of you have a policy that handles employees replacing or providing compensation for damaging company hardware. So, we have two accidental damages that are out of warranty. We are a fairly new non-profit. No purposeful or constant damage has occurred. I was asked by HR to find out and create a policy for it. We are located in Little Rock, AR, USA

                              <span>We want to change our krbtgt Password that has pwdlastset attribut from 2001(!).
 Our domain Forrest Level ist W2016 and we dont have any old XP or 2003 Clients. There are no AD Trusts that have to be considered. 
 This is the klist output:
 Client: user @ domain
 Server: krbtgt/domain@ domain
 KerbTicket: RSADSI RC4-HMAC(NT)
 From my understanding of the kerberos and the pwd change process, nothing can go wrong here (except if i change the password rapidly two times in a row).
 But is there anything I need to consider when changing such an old krbtgt Password with RC4 Ticket encryption still in place?

For protection I am not going to name positions but lets just say our &quot;Director of IT&quot; has been making life hard for IT in general. Doesn&#x27;t want SNMP or other types of monitoring as &quot;The IT staff should be doing that every day&quot;, we must make tickets for issues ourselves because &quot;It would make IT look unfriendly to have the company submit tickets&quot;, Cant use password managers like Keeper or OnePassword because &quot;that would be too controlling&quot; for the staff, can&#x27;t bring the company under one brand of computer because &quot;it is simpler to let workers use what works best for them&quot;
 ​
 The list keeps going on and on. It feels like he does not know how IT works or is just actively working against IT. We can&#x27;t have him removed because the owner thinks he walks on water and s**** roses.

 I got a coupe in person interviews setup.

 Should I be wearing a suit to the interviews or is that over kill now?

 ​
 Does anyone know how to create a KQL alert for when a user is having 2 MFA app Authentication Methods configured? By default we have 1 app MFA method and Phone SMS setup, but if a user setup app MFA method for lets say a tablet, or another phone, then we want to have an alert on it.
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 I have two domains and need nothing but registration and DNS from my registrar.
 Besides the incessant nagging, I do remember there were DNS issues, but I cannot definitively recall what they were... I think some problem with quad records and some limitation with A records for subdomains.
 Any recommendations for the best alternative? Again, I don&#x27;t need any hosting/email/marketing/junk.

It&#x27;s very confusing to me and I feel like I don&#x27;t know how it managed to succeeed where I failed so many times. I can&#x27;t even tell if there&#x27;s anyone else in the same boat as me.

                              <span>For specific app registrations that require a ton of API permissions to be configured in the tenant, has anyone looked into a scripting those api perms? We have an application we use in our client&#x27;s envs and the app has like well over 30 api permissions to manually configure for each app setup. Would be nice to find a way to automate that process.

                              <span>We have a few Windows Server VMs on-prem. All of them except for our DNS/DHCP server are not super critical. Even if our DNS/DHCP server was compromised or died, we have a back up of the configs that we could just throw on a new Windows server instance. Most other VMs mainly just serve as app servers for facilities, or jump boxes for ScreenConnect. We run Veeam backups, but they&#x27;re not being off-sited. They could go down and people could still do their jobs, but we&#x27;d still have to rebuild things for them.
 If we were ever compromised, the org would not really be heavily affected, but we&#x27;d probably spend quite a bit of time setting new things back up. My question, is should we invest the money and time into making sure we have off-site backups if the information is not super critical? Or are things more critical than I really think?

                              <span>So i’m working as IT support and in this new company i’ve never had experience to troubleshoot Mac, fuck, i’ve never seen in my country that someone using Mac. 
 So, its not that hard to be Mac administrator but here is a problem that i saw first time today. I had to wipe one laptop and to install a new MacOS and for some reason even after wiping and cleaning HD they are still asking me to put Apple ID which is weird because i don’t have it ( guy left company ) and even after erasing Mac it’s still asking me to put apple ID. 
 My HR department sent him e-mail but i doubt he will tell us his password so my question is what should i do next ? If i try to reinstall MacOS from USB stick, will i still have same problem ?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Another long time lurker, fist time poster. Sorry for languange (not my first language) and if i missed community.
 So, my company is IT company, dealing primary in software developement. We are part of companys that are privaty held by one person. No compay helds share of other company, one person is phisical owner of all companys. Also owners wish is that our compay deals with all IT related problem.
 So the problem is, that people from this companys are freaquenty working in some other company ( in this group of companys) and bringing their PC&#x27;s around, making a mess with licence tracking. It is not realistic, that when a person is tasked to work at other company for a period of time, his PC will be sold to this company and then (after he is finished) soled back to primary company again.
 So our idea is, that my company (IT) would own all the PC&#x27;s and server, and leasing it to other companys. We can easly track where some PC is (majoraty of month), and invoiced the proper compay for monthy usage of this PC. But i cannot get the information if this kind of bussines model is legal from Microsoft Windows OS stand point? We would like to do the same with servers (Win Srv 2019 Datacenter for hosts and Standard for WMs).
 Can we buy PCs and laptops with OEM Win PRO licence and lease them to other companys?
 Thank you for pointing me in right direction, i will gladly provide additional information. And off course leagal and financial teams will be involved before pulling the trigger on the decision.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m looking for a recommendation for a product that folks have used and are happy with. I think ultimately we&#x27;d like a single product for endpoint security, but that may not be possible. 
 The most pressing issue is endpoint content filtering and https decryption. We need to be able to control URLs per-user or per-user group, and when we enable certain URLs (office365 for example) we need to re-write http headers to allow login only to certain tenants (similar to this KB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions ) However, we&#x27;re going to want to control this for more and more cloud providers (adobe cloud, google workspaces, aws, etc) and each has a slightly different way they want the http header re-written to be able to lock down which users can login. 
 The above is my most pressing need right now, and cisco umbrella can do this when using the more advanced flavors of the product and the cisco AnyConnect agent on the endpoint, however it&#x27;s limited to like 6 cloud providers at the moment, and not flexible. 
 So please let me know if you have a product you are happy with that can do the above. Now ideally this product would also replace our AV/Firewall/EDR as well, but that&#x27;s sort of a secondary goal. 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello there, 
 how can i give our front desk the permission to adjust the bookings (from other colleeagues!) in our room ressources?
 She already has full access to the rooms and can delete the bookings just fine.
 But she can&#x27;t adjust the times. They are greyed out in the scheduling assistant. She also can&#x27;t invite other persons.
 As far as i know they were able to do that in Exchange on Prem. At least they told me that they were.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Good Morning Sysadmins,
 I am a bit unfamiliar and i am looking for more experienced sys admins personal experiences. Last week I created a few new subnets via the meraki dashboard and deployed the corrresponding firewalls accordingly. (In the past I&#x27;ve only worked with subnets that have already existed.
 Is there anything else I can do to prep network after creating new subnets. Ex dhcp/dns server settings? 
 Thank you

 What&#x27;re typical policies on sharing IT policies with the general public?

                              <span>How would you approach in terms to data backup with given scenario: 
 - All the data is stored on a Synology NAS 70TB capacity
 - There are 50TB of data and 4 million files
 - There is an unused old/outdated Isilon cluster with 289TB available
 - Not all data has the same criticality and many of them files are GigaBite sized could points or HD video. Loads of photos too 
 To me the easiest way would be to use Hyper Backup on synology to Isilon but when configuring it says &quot;no modules available&quot; and given Isilon is on a very much outdated version and this cannot be reverted (rsync 2.6.9 version) I would love to hear any ideas and create a nice discussion topic

                              <span>Our small company has recently suffered the tragic untimely loss of a much loved member of staff. My question is, what do we do with the mailbox now? What is the accepted &#x27;protocol&#x27;? Do we redirect and issue an auto-reply saying the employee is deceased? Do we say nothing?? When an employee leaves under normal circumstances their mailbox is archived and their email address is added as an alias to someone else&#x27;s mailbox who picks up any emails.
 What do you do? We don&#x27;t have a HR dept to ask.

Also I only control the UK side. My boss was asking me should we still be using skykick. I have no control over this application at all and tbh have no idea what it does or what it&#x27;s for. Could someone give me a quick rundown on what it is and if it&#x27;s something you think we should still be paying for. Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 I have been working as an IT-apprentice now for 1.5 years (my first job in IT ever). I have mostly done first line support for the company, this including installing new PCs, setting up new users, printers, phones, meeting rooms etc.
 In about a month there will be a subject test for me to get a certificate of apprenticeship.
 I just recieved what the last two apprentices had to do and I have no idea how to do this stuff as I have not done this type of stuff before, ever.
 In short what I have to do:
 &quot;Set up a new IT-system for a school/business.&quot;
 - Three servers: two Domain Controllers and one Fileserver
 - Install two clients with windows and configurating them
 - IP range/segment (?)
 - Set up and configurate: AD, DNS, DHCP, Print and Document Services, Shares, Public and personal space.
 - Set up GPO for public and private
 - I also need to set up a switch, wich the two clients and printer will be connected to.
 The servers will be virtual (VMware)
 I have googled, but not sure what Im looking for.
 Im not asking for a full guide, but rather a nodge in the right direction. 
 This test will be over five days, I will also need to plan, document and evaluate my own work before presenting it.

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I&#x27;m setting up some systems for the first time so I wanted to check best practices and security before implementation. I&#x27;m working for a SMB, the time has come to replace our old fileserver which contains over 20TB of files over the past several years. Currently, this file server&#x27;s a windows server with multiple SMB shares on for pretty much all work across the business. 
 ​
 A new Dell ME5 Powervault has been set up running RAID10 with a single large LUN &amp; volume. I have several queries on the best practice and configuration having only really worked with small setups single hosts, local storage etc. I&#x27;d like to ensure this is done properly.
 ​
 1) Should I just attach the Powervault on iSCSI using windows iSCSI Connect on a VM, then place the NTFS files direct on here? Or would a large VHDX be better for any reason e.g. performance, security, backup then mount this to Hyper-V? Or even multiple smaller VHDX&#x27;s due to the size? 
 2) Security wise without too much impact on performance what is best e.g. CHAPS, Full disk encryption on the PowerVault, separate VLAN between the Powervault and Hypervisor? This would be done using a core switch, I don&#x27;t have separate hardware I could use for isolation. 
 3) Is robocopy still the best method using MIR or /XO and ran before and after cut-off of the old server shares?
 4) Any other advise on best practices and security?

                              <span>Hi guys
 I want that domain users can restart a specific service. I was able to set the permission with sc.exe.
 So far so good. But with this settings the user is also able to just stop the service, what I dont want. So I want to deploy a cmd script, instead of advising the users to do something in services. So the users can just double click the cmd script and the service will restart.
 Even though I granted the access for the user to restart the service (it works in services), the access with cmd (net stop &amp;&amp; net start) is not granted. Is there a possibility?
 Best regards

                              <span>I have been using the same Logitech M-U0007 mouse &amp; MS ergo keyboard (the one with the weird bump) for like 3-4 years and I love them. Other coworkers seem to dislike my keyboard though :(
 Lately i&#x27;ve been having some performance issues with my mouse and it looks like the sensor is dying.
 I would like to know what my fellow Sysadmins use. Do you use regular company provided KB and mouse set or do you supply your own?
 I&#x27;m treating it like recommendations and i&#x27;m interested in the different kind of hardware.
 My hands are quite large (I know, I know) and I prefer an ergonomic design with side buttons.

                              <span>Hey All,
 Having an odd issue, we have half a dozen staff using Macs for creative work and over 40 staff on windows devices. The windows devices have 0 issues with the SMB V3 share. Our macs also seem to work fine, i&#x27;m able to download and upload large files fairly quickly no issue.
 The problem we&#x27;re having is InDesign saving to our servers SMB share. A 15MB InDesign file with a few images linked takes 40 seconds to save both when opened from the server and saved back or worked from a local source and saved to the server. I can copy a few GB from the same device to the server in less time with finder. If saved locally InDesign saves instantly. If copied and pasted from the macs local drive to the server it&#x27;s also instant. InDesign feels like it just spins for 35s before trying to create a file.
 Has anyone else experienced this? We&#x27;re using InDesign 18.1 on a 2017 iMac running Monterey 12.3.1 and a 2020 iMac also running the same OS and InDesign version. I&#x27;ve tried earlier versions back to 17.0 with the same issue still occurring.

                              <span>I have been working in IT for 10 years, started as a sysadmin and spent the past 5 years as a DevOps engineer. In each company I&#x27;ve worked for, I&#x27;ve faced the challenge of managing tedious requests from developers, like restoring databases after they&#x27;ve broken them or granting access to databases for investigating bugs, creating new repositories, adding users to it, service restarts, redeployment requests etc...
 Sometimes, it can be overwhelming and tiring to manage these tasks. I&#x27;m curious to know if other DevOps/system engineers feel the same way. Do you also find this part of your job to be frustrating and tedious, that you try to avoid it and start procrastinating?

                              <span>Good morning.
 I want to configure an Ubuntu VM with SAMBA to create a shared folder.
 We currently use AD in my organization.
 Is there any recommendation to do it in the best way?
 I am referring to the security issue.
 Can I use CLAMAV to live scan the shared folder?
 The VM with Ubuntu, would only be used to create that share.
 Greetings and thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I am going to struggle to articulate what I&#x27;m looking to achieve here because I&#x27;m not sure how I go about this. 
 We currently have a suite of software delivered by a third party application - kind of like adobe creative cloud but for engineering.
 Now we had a policy change that means we no longer allow any user to be a local admin group member on any client endpoint. We instead use LAPS for the odd occasion when admin right sis needed.
 Before this policy change, the software suite was run via a service whose user was in every local admin group on all user endpoints, so this service no longer works and we&#x27;re struggling to use other methods such as intune due to the size of the applications etc.
 So I guess what my question is, how do I make a service have the ability to run things as an administrator in the users login? 
 The applications we install are all based on a network share and currently I run the application as the local (LAPS) administrator and then pass user credentials to access the share. Very clumsy. The alternative I have setup for now is a script that deploys via intune its mounts a drive as system using hardcoded user credentials in the script to mount the share as a drive then manually running a shortcut for the executable (this is hit and miss). 
 My assumption is to run the service as system, but I don&#x27;t think that this would be able to access network shares and also be able to interact with the user session for the install.
 Apologies if this is not very clear.

Costs 5000$), in the end supposed to be certified AZ-104 Azure Administrator + CCNA7 and some stuff I don&#x27;t know cause I know basically nothing technical about this field. The place giving the course has a contractual obligation for placing you in some workplace after you pass. So I have a couple of questions:
  
What are the different job descriptions/options, what&#x27;s the difference day-to-day, and can you rank how shitty or not they are in terms of work-life balance and general vibes / the wanting-to-roblox-scale? Depends on place etc. of course, but I&#x27;m guessing some are still better than others. The course says it&#x27;ll certify me to work a…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I just connected new domain controller DC2 (2022 server), the dhcp service has been left on the DC1 (2012 r2) server, The problem is that no dynamic client updates appear in the dns of the DC2 server. When I run dcdiag there are no errors. Is it normal behavior that dynamic client updates appear only on this server where DHCP service is running, or should it be synchronized to all DC/DNS servers?

                              <span>So I got a non-standard request that I haven&#x27;t encountered before.
 A client has a company-issued laptop that will be used by remote/outsourced staff based overseas and as consequence of that, they&#x27;d like this laptop to be prevented from joining public WiFi networks but to still be able to join any WiFi networks that are considered either home or corporate networks.
 This a Windows 10 laptop joined to an Azure AD domain.
 I&#x27;m unsure of any built-in method in Windows that can achieve this and the client&#x27;s current AV solution also doesn&#x27;t have this functionality built into it (Webroot Endpoint).
 I know you can block a Windows device from joining specific SSIDs but Windows only determines a network is public/private/domain AFTER joining it via NLA, so on a technical level I don&#x27;t see how the OS would know that particular network is &quot;public&quot; before being joined to it and therefore know that it&#x27;s not allowed to join it?
 Is this something that you&#x27;d only be able to implement via 3rd-party software?
 Are there any Azure AD-based security policies that could achieve this?

We&#x27;re financially secure on just my income, but I&#x27;m thinking of working a second part-time IT related gig for additional income. We&#x27;ve been making great progress towards buying our first home in our HCoL area, and I would like to continue saving or at least not dip into our savings if possible. Anyone working 10-20 hours per week on a side gig or just a part time primary job? Thanks!

                              <span>I am working with some huge datasets (journal entries from our ERP) and we have had performance issues connecting the TXT files directly to PowerBI in the past. I’d like to load the data to a database first and then connect to PowerBI via SQL to improve performance.
 My background is more in visualization so I have not had to set up a database before. Are there any recommendations on databases that take into account learning curve for a newbie? There may be some data transformation involved as well but that can be done in PowerBI.
 I was thinking of SQL Server but wanted to get some opinions. Thanks!!

As part of the onboarding process, i&#x27;ve been tasked with figuring out some &quot;baseline&quot; searches and queries to save that would be useful. 
 What are some of the most useful &quot;canned&quot; or custom queries / search functions you&#x27;ve utilized, that you couldn&#x27;t do without? 
 As an example, in Tanium for instance it might be useful to get all workstations that need a reboot. For this, the query would be: 
 &quot;Get Reboot Required from all machines&quot; 
 What are some examples of some &quot;go to&quot; scripts, queries etc that you use frequently? 
 Thanks!

 We&#x27;ve tried several resolutions including adjusting to classic theme, remote FX, RDP bitmap settings etc, without a resolution.
 The focus issue appears to be specifically related to the version of mstsc on the local computer as the focus issue occur on older versions on Windows.
 Just wondering if anyone else has had issues and found a fix?

                              <span>As the new network engineer for a certain company, I have inherited some...less than stellar network design choices. Regarding TACACS, I have had to make due with what&#x27;s available until new equipment arrives. In the interim, I am trying to do some AAA implementation and getting hung up on a specific set of commands I&#x27;d like to restrict if possible.
 I am trying to restrict the Tier 1 techs in a way that allows them to manipulate a VLAN&#x27;s tagged/untagged ports, but there are other commands under &quot;vlan&quot; I&#x27;d like for them to not be able to access. So, to add a port to, say VLAN 10, as untagged it would look like this:
 switch(config)# vlan 10 untagged ethernet 16 
 The problem is, it seems that I can only either allow no access to the &quot;vlan&quot; command tree or allow all. I say that because I do not know and have not been able to find a way to tell TACACS to allow the user access to the list of VLANs (since they are user defined) or the port number. I&#x27;ve tried using an asterisk after the &quot;vlan&quot; entry like so:
 vlan * untagged ethernet * 
 And other variations of this, but nothing has seemed to work. If anyone has any advice I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it, I would prefer not to have to give them access to the whole &quot;vlan&quot; command tree.

 Not running any IPS or VPN outside of RA-VPN for a handful of users. I read somewhere its a &#x27;screamer&#x27; running ASA code but wondering if anyone has any first hand experience with them. They would be on a 1gig(symmetrical) or less circuits and only doing RA-VPN for 10-15 users at most.

The issue is that I feel like there is a possibility that these IP addresses can be compressed to their optimum CIDR equivalent. Also, there is IPv6 addresses in there as well.
  104.44.41.24/30 104.44.41.32/32 104.44.41.34/31 104.44.41.36/30 104.44.41.130/31 104.44.41.132/30 ... 
 I am not sure what would be the best way to approach this. If I write something from scratch, I am absolutely confident that it will be terrible. So, I am hoping that someone smarter than me has already figured out this problem.

 We are troubleshooting packet loss issues at a office location. Essentially I am working with an MSP. When I arrived today colasoft ping tool showed a 10% packet loss out of around 2000 packets. Troubleshooting showed that the loss was only occurring with traffic north of the firewall, the next hop is provider equipment. 
 Some notes about the configuration: - the firewall (watchguard firebox T80) has a static public address on the WAN interface - the provider router (technicolor, not really familiar) is supposed to be in bridge mode and claim that is the case
 The problem currently; - when the provider router reboots, things seem fine but gradually packet loss percentage begins to climb over the course of the day - when I run traceroutes, I see the provider router as a hop. When I…</span>

 I&#x27;ve tried every method I can think of, but I cannot get these certs to work.

 Cloudflare DNS (Proxied) Subdomain (sub.domain.tld) &gt; Web Server&#x27;s Public IP Address &gt; Cisco ASA with port forwarding on 80 and 443 to internal web server &gt; Windows Server 2022 running IIS 10.
 I can hit IIS on HTTP/80 but nothing I do will allow me to get an HTTPS connection.
 On web browser clients outside of my network, I get &quot;Invalid SSL Certificate Error 526&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve tried both &quot;Full&quot; and &quot;Full (Strict)&quot; SSL modes, I&#x27;ve tried revoking and reissuing the certificate, I&#x27;ve tried including and excluding the wildcard and root domain along with the subdomain I want to secure, I&#x27;ve tried usin…</span>

We have a year to move our stuff back on-prem. Currently we&#x27;re working on updating our own public IPs (from 2 ISPs) into a BGP set up (2 routers). Is there a way we can configure the BGP to make migrating our services back easier? like including the 100.1.1.x network in the bgp mix? Or should i treat these as two separate projects?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to learn and implement a network management tool to cover Calix E7 Shelves that contain EXA and AXOS network cards. My department is mostly interested in Zabbix since its open source, but I have heard that there are better tools out there such as SolarWinds and LogicMonitor. I am also concerned because from an compliance standpoint, Zabbix is internationally headquartered. As an ISP, is it safe/reasonable to implement a foreign, open-source network management tool?
 On that note, does anyone have any experience with a tool that would allow for automation, security monitoring, and data logging for an ISP network? As we may move away from Calix equipment in the future, interoperability and accessibility are important.

                              <span>Hello, we have a relatively complicated network setup that I have tried draw below to help explain. Currently we have two campuses linked together by a Siklu Etherhaul Wireless device (spec&#x27;d at 1gbps but really we get around 600mbps). We are a few days away from commissioning a new leased fibre circuit(using Openreach here in the UK) at 1gbps. We use this kind of site to site link in several location and we will be getting the full 1gbps throughput. I want to be in a position where by default, the switches will use the more reliable and higher bandwidth fibre link, not the WiFi.
 My concern is that by default, spanning tree will look at the two options for routing the traffic, see that they are both technically advertised as 1000mbps and just decide to use the WiFi.
 Can anyone advise how I can forcefully set the fibre link as the default in SPT?

                              <span>Eventually looking at the 5400, but I&#x27;d like to get familiarized with Palo&#x27;s interface and nomenclature. Looks like the 400 and 1400 mostly fit the role, and could both be managed by Panorama. Only need 100mbps of throughput to replace this ASA5506.

 I am tasked with doing research on purchasing some Bidirectional SFPs and I cant seem to find any made by Cisco. Do they make their own branded BiDi SFPs?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Previous ISP installed a microtik router that allowed us to use multiple ports for our different static IP addresses. 
 New ISP has given us a modem with a single hand off. Would the solution here be to install a dumb switch after the ISP modem and plug in our 2 separate firewalls to the switch and assign static IPs?
 2 firewalls, yes I know. One is for a 2nd company that needs traffic as separate as possible from the other.

                              <span>So I have a question on how acceptable this is. I have a property where all of the inner vlan routing is done at the firewall level, the level of communication between vlans is relatively small and it has never been an issue.
 ​
 We recently installed a new security camera system and I am looking to relieve the new traffic now moving through the firewall from the camera to employee VLANs. My initial thoughts were to add IPs and a static route on our L3 core switch (that we currently do not use for any routing) and change the gateway for the camera vlan to point to the switch. I would keep the gateway of the employee vlan to the firewall, but the L3 switch would also be in the subnet sending the video feeds from the camera vlan, I was also planning on setting up the switch ACLs so just the camera ports are allowed through the switch.
 ​
 Does that sound reasonable? I could also change the DHCP scope for the employee vlan to the core and set the default route to the firewall on the switch, but the traffic to the camera vlan from employee is pretty minimal.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve just finished my CCNP Enterprise, but I&#x27;d really like to take it one step further and get a CCIE. I&#x27;ve been learning from the official Cisco courses for the ENCOR and ENARSI exam (from cisco learning networks store), but unfortunately there is no single course there, that would prepare me for the CCIE EI lab. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on what course/courses to take over the next few months/years to prepare for the lab?
 I&#x27;m thinking about starting the official course for the ENSDWI. That would probably prepare me for the SD-WAN part, because although I have some experience with it, but to learn how to set it up from 0 it totally different from just operating it and making some changes to it.
 Unfortunately at my company we don&#x27;t have any clients, that would use Cisco SD Access, so I&#x27;m also looking for a place, where I can at least do some labs with the Cisco DNA Center. Also a bit more some BGP and MPLS practice wouldn&#x27;t hurt, but I think that can be simulated by GNS3 or some other network sim.
 Do you have any preffered courses? What did help you to earn CCIE (or how are you preparing for CCIE)?
 Thanks

                              <span>We had some emergency funding for this during the pandemic and then it fizzled out as people transitioned back to working onsite. Suddenly the org is now hiring and shifting to hiring remote only workers for a significant number of users. Technical remote support in my experience has been very involved. This seems like a good time for administrative meetings to discuss a support structure, funding and more Human Resources to support this. Is anyone else experiencing this? What are you doing?

                              <span>So - I was recently voluntold to help get a new network implemented for a nonprofit I help out at. Sure! I forgot how much i forgot however, it’s been a hot minute. Hoping you all can help get me on the right path.
 Setup: all 1G managed switches, Some connected by copper some by fiber/SFPs. Low low client count (under 100). There’s also a cable company provided gateway/router which spits out 192.168.0.x DHCP addresses internally. They also pay for two static IPs 10.x.x.x that currently go to some standalone ubiquiti server that routes them and handles the wifi internet access point traffic currently. The idea is to retire all that soonish. Keep if we must.
 All i wanted to do was set up this new network of switches i mentioned above on its own subnet (192.168.2.x) and everything on that subnet would be static IPs - and connect it at one place on ine switch with (i had assumed) A static route so anything not .2.x would get pushed to the cable company gateway/router and to the outside world. The .2.x subnet is for a POE camera system for them so thats why i was thinking keep it separate.. flawed? There’s also wifi 6 access points they want to add later for internet connectivity, and retire the old ubiquiti setup.
 Is this the right idea? Or should i swap over everything to be on the .0.x subnet? Should i leave everything on DHCP?
 Thanks..

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have some issues with the networking thought you may have the same experience or you could help.
 We are running QEMU/KVM on Dual Epyc servers (256 logical core) with Mellanox dual 40G connections. When our customers were pushing more than 50k pps and a few hundred mbps starts to drop the VM&#x27;s packets. However, the server load and the network load are very low almost nothing.
 We were start tune the network and the Kernel of the host as AMD/Intel recommended to see how it goes. Started using Vhost and multi-queues but now we are seeing a heavy load on the CPU from the Vhost/network which is higher than 70% of the CPU time with only a small number of VM&#x27;s on these servers. Around 60VM&#x27;s with low usage on CPU and 500Mbit (110k pps) on the network. The two Epyc 7h12 with 256 logical cores are pushing around 80 percent of the CPU and more than 60 percent of it is from the network/vhost. Now we don&#x27;t have packet drops but under a heavy CPU load.
 Here are the configurations and changes we made.
 We have started with this 3 months ago
 -netdev tap,id&#x3D;nic0,ifname&#x3D;$TAPIF,script&#x3D;no,downscript&#x3D;no,vhost&#x3D;on,queues&#x3D;8 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev&#x3D;nic0,mq&#x3D;on,vectors&#x3D;10,mac&#x3D;$MAC 
 Still had packet loss.
 Latest config. High CPU load but no packet drops.
 -netdev tap,id&#x3D;nic0,ifname&#x3D;$TAPIF,script&#x3D;no,downscript&#x3D;no,vhost&#x3D;on,queues&#x3D;2,poll-us&#x3D;50000 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev&#x3D;nic0,mq&#x3D;on,vectors&#x3D;10,rx_queue_size&#x3D;1024,tx_queue_size&#x3D;1024,packed&#x3D;on,mac&#x3D;$MAC 
 This is how we create a network interface
 ip tuntap add $TAPIF mode tap user $َUSERNAME multi_queue
 Any idea?
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a large fiber project and I&#x27;m curious as to what type of transceivers I need. We have fiber switches ina central location sending data to homes. In most all cases, we put a media converter on the home end and connect an ethernet cable to their router. But rarely I will need to connect to an sfp port on a router. What are the requirements for the tranceivers? I need a downstream on the switch end and upstream on the router end? Do the brands need to be the same? Do bi-directional transceivers work on either end? Please forgive my ignorance on any terms I&#x27;m using here. Advice appreciated.

                              <span>I think, from the network operator perspective, the Remote Monitoring feature (RMON) is just adding new MIBs to SNMP MIBs and it helps to monitor network statistics for better network visibility.
 What can I use instead of RMON to have good network visibility? Sflow or something similar could be a good alternative, ya? What would you suggest to replace with RMON?
 Apart from that, A sound box with REST API support or NETCONF support, could give the network operator what RMON provides, right?

                              <span>Pardon if this is not allowed though not sure where to post.
 Have to post on a throwaway as I have colleagues here that frequent the subreddit.
 My country&#x27;s economy is currently in free-fall at the moment and need to start looking to get out as there really isn&#x27;t any sort of comprehensive or cohesive plan to get themselves out of this mess. I have family in both of the mentioned countries though my Dutch is a bit stronger than my German I guess.
 Checking if anyone on /r/networking knows the status of job market in those markets , and what skills are sought after there ? Have started scouring the job sites to get a reasonable idea what to expect though would be nice to get some opinions from actual grunts on the ground.
 Have 10+ years experience on the enterprise side of things . Have some AWS certs and busy burning through Azure and DevNet certs at the moment just to cement that I have knowledge in these areas as I deal with these at $dayjob but never really got the time to write the exams.
 Thank you to all that reply

                              <span>Say I have corporate network A, if I am connected directly to corporate network A, and the public (static) IP address of network A is whitelisted for the Postgresql database, I can connect only on my very first attempt. After which all connection attempts fail.
 If I am connected to network A via a VPN, (same network, same public IP) the connection works fine every time. 
 When running a traceroute to the database URI directly from network A, the requests time out at servers owned by the corporation running our managed firewall, but they claim to outbound traffic to Azure on port 5432 gets blocked. 
 When running traceroute connected to network A via VPN, it immediately just times out. 
 Does anyone have an idea of what might be wrong here?

                              <span>Past: I am a nearly 25yr system engineer that has mainly focused on VMware, storage, systems management and motioning. Starting as helpdesk in the late 90s and working up to infrastructure ops team manager, then back to contribute after a re-org. 
 Current: SysOps focused on infrastructure - compute and storage. About 70% on-prem/30% AWS.
 Future: Moving some of the environment to GCP, signing on with Snowflake for our data and reporting source. Manager has mentioned over the next few years our roles (2 Sr engineers incl me, 1 Jr engineer) will be migrating to more of a data engineering role. 
 My question for the hive: Where do I start my knowledge migration? I&#x27;m heavily involved in the Snowflake build and rollout. Should I start to focus on SQL, Python? Look into PowerBI and Looker (GCP)? I&#x27;m not feeling overwhelmed yet, but feel if I wait too much longer to get new knowledge learned, I&#x27;ll start falling behind. I&#x27;d like to stay on top of it all as much as I can.

 Hi, I am basically the only IT Guy in this place so I handle everything from preventing hacks to right down creating sites and password resets..
 Logic here is: that guy knows IT lets ask him to do all the work that is related to computer 
 So can someone please help me with this, if you have any experience.
 Basically my employer wants to setup a landing page on all the pcs in out company, so when someone opens a browser they get this site as the homepage to they can just open all the company sites without going around asking for links..
 Something similar to linktree

                              <span>Hello fellow admins, I come seeking your advice and knowledge on the best way to structure file permissions. Ideally the best-practice methods.
 The organization that I&#x27;m working for has struggled with file server permissions for 10+ years. I am a recent to the company and as I have to work and set permissions for users, their current mess makes it extremely difficult to follow some kind of structure for setting permissions.
 What I&#x27;m working with:
  
Global company with parent and child domains.
 Share permissions list various security groups.
 NTFS permissions have security groups with Full Control permissions.
 Security groups that are part of other security groups that are part of other security groups.
  
My first course of action is to remove all security groups from the Share permis…</span>

                              <span>A year and a half ago I was dumb, needed my first IT job and they were the only people that would hire me. Help Desk Agent at $12/hr, worst fucking place I&#x27;ve seen. Users so dumb that I wouldn&#x27;t trust with a car, let alone a computer.
 Then I went back to college, dropped that shitty job, got an internship at $30/hr; got 4 IT certifications, working on cool tech I never thought I would touch in a million years. Life&#x27;s pretty good, and have been at my current employer since.
 However, these recruiters at TEKsystems will not leave me alone. They keep calling me at odd hours of the day asking me if I want to work for pennies, they keep sending me emails for job listings that are asking for the whole IT department in one person. No matter how much I tell them I make, a new recruiter comes by every week or two and does the same thing. It&#x27;s like a bad ex that won&#x27;t leave me alone.
 My advice to the new people trying to break into IT reading this is to never touch TEKsystems, and to never give them your information. There has to be a mom &amp; pop shop near you that&#x27;ll be much better to work for, these parasites will just keep calling you no matter what. Learn from my mistake.

                              <span>At a loss for this - have you ever seen a VMWare VM, running 2016/SQL Server, that will periodically become unresponsive to RDP or console (while responding to ping) as if it was being overutilized - but VMWare (and separate metric collection) shows CPU usage is near zero and RAM usage dropped? It always clears up after a few minutes.
 We have a dozen servers with exactly the same software and only one is doing this; vMotion to another host doesn&#x27;t affect it. Nothing in the event logs leading up to it (other than AG disconnect notice during it) that&#x27;s unique. Persists after reboot. No indication in metrics of high CPU or RAM usage or high disk latency or queue length or anything leading up to the event.
 Did something in last month&#x27;s Windows Update really FUBAR it? Any idea what to look at?

 I could probably see a spinoff of this sub, turning into a weekly sysadmin recap podcast, but until then (if it ever happens) I&#x27;m curious if anyone has some recommendations for industry relevant podcasts, blogs or the like. Recently started listening to &quot;Grumpy Old Geeks&quot; and I periodically check out BleepingComputer amongst a few others, and looking for other places to check out.

                              <span>In two weeks I’m starting a Senior Admin job with absolutely no understanding of Powershell/Automation. 
 Unlike now, it wasn’t all the rage when I was in college so it was never taught to me. (I also didn’t go to a good school so that doesn’t help lol.)
 Management has made it clear that my focus should be streamlining their operations, making the IT department more efficient and organized as a whole. I’m sure that automation is going to need to play a big role in this, but again I’m clueless on this stuff.
 What path should I take to start my automation journey?

 I&#x27;m still getting into stuff but some things no one has the credentials for, or they can&#x27;t give me a solid answer on how things are setup. It&#x27;s kind of stressful but kind of fun at the same time. A big concern is getting into their Meraki cloud setup. Their AD is a mess but I can handle that and some of their servers haven&#x27;t been updated in 6+ months.

But starting today when I type in Adobe acrobat, the letter P has a line at the bottom, it does not happen to any other words and I cannot find a single solution online. I reinstalled, and it is up to date, PC didn&#x27;t go thru any updates either. Below is a link to a screenshot, typing in caps does not create the line.

                              <span>Hi,recently I have received a remark from the security team about short SSH host key on one of our servers. It&#x60;s 1024 bit, and as far as I know today&#x60;s standard is 2048 at least, even if 1024 bit length key is not broken yet.I&#x60;m just wondering what is a real attack scenario based on short ssh-rsa host key? Supposing (hypothetically ) the adversaries derived private key from public, what are those keys used for? What the attacker can do with that? I understand that host key pair is used for a host authentication, but is that all? Does it take part in key exchange procedure?
 Thanks

Also if the server is in headoffice and Client wanna connect to server then the only solution is VPN or there are other safer way to achieve this ? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never used Terraform and Kubernetes and the project hasn&#x27;t started yet, so if you think I should switch technologies feel free to let me know. I usually use Docker and Puppet.
 ​
 Suppose I have 3 dedicated servers and a VPS
 ​
  
A Dedicated server running Postgres on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running a Go server on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running Python sever on Kubernetes
 The VPS is used to monitor those servers and for admin tasks
  
​
 I have the following questions:
 ​
  
Let&#x27;s say that the Postgres server is running low on resources, does Kubernetes notify me to buy a new server? 
 
If I need to set alarms manually to buy a new server, then what are the best practices? How do you decide when it&#x27;s time to buy a new server? 
 
Can I buy a new server and not add it to any cluster and let Kubernetes decide if it wants to add it to any of the clusters mentioned above? Can I have servers on standby and then Kubernetes either use it for Postgres or Go etc?
 
How to protect against DDOS? Do I run all the clusters behind Cloudflare Or Do I buy additional firewall servers and run the clusters behind the firewall? Is it easy to set up Cloudflare?
 
 ​
 So essentially, we&#x27;re starting a new project, and we&#x27;ll need at least 3 servers and a VPS as mentioned above, the project might scale up and if it does, I want to have answers to those questions so I know how to act.

                              <span>All I hear is my manager slating someone who said something to him once, therefore we don’t help them. Or we put roadblocks in place so they can’t have what they request, using the excuse of GDPR or PCI. I won’t go into specifics but it’s pretty clear he’s lying, sometimes it’s just unrelated entirely but users buy into it because he bombards them with buzzwords and tech language. Overhearing it gives me second hand embarrassment. Someone complained once about wanting a different ISP because the last one let us down at a major event (this is true), all of a sudden my manager fucking hates him and refuses to assist him. Ever. 
 We also only choose suppliers that are his friends. The companies we choose get paid double what anyone else would charge, some work we could actually do in house as certain team members are actually certified in that area, but we choose to go with some random external contractors who charges insane amounts. 
 I don’t know how he’s getting away with it. Nobody dare question him because he confuses them with jargon and gets majorly defensive. 
 It’s making the job really rubbish, it feels like one vicious circle. User requests support with purchasing new software &gt; user complained about IT once &gt; we refuse to assist them &gt; user buys new system themselves anyway &gt; system gets implement with no support from us, constant roadblocks, dragging our heels &gt; poor end users get issues and ring for help, we refuse. It’s so fucking awkward as the person answering the phone to deny them assistance.
 I do this job to earn money, I know it’s not personal, but honestly it makes me sad how far behind we are with technology and not giving end users a solution that would really improve their work.

                              <span>Dear fellow sysadmins, seeking your advice on how to address a recent phishing email incident in our organization. The email successfully bypassed our existing security measures and landed in one of our executive&#x27;s inbox. The concerning part is that the email display name was cleverly spoofed to appear as our internal HR department, despite coming from an external email address r12fdf@icloud.com.
  
 I&#x27;m wondering if adding our HR department email group (hr@mycompany.com) and other similar department email groups as a &quot;user&quot; to be protected from impersonation in Microsoft Defender anti-phishing policy would prevent similar spoofed display emails from reaching any of our user&#x27;s inboxes.
  
 I would appreciate any suggestions, insights, or alternative solutions that you might have in this regard. Thank you for your help in advance! On M365 Exchange Online and Microsoft Defender.

                              <span>Hi, I was just wondering, if one wants a hardware token, why one should buy a yubikey ? Linux seems to accept any USB stick as a hardware token, as long as it&#x27;s initially configured by the pam library. Alternatives such as nitro/solo/only key exist, and known brands such as kingston and verbatim have models on which Fido protocol is implemented.
 So what would be the point of getting a pricy yubikey ? Because yubico partners with big services providers ? Is a &quot;pam homecooked&quot; hardware token not crossplatform ? not accepted by these service providers ? Is yubikey the answer only because it embed additional NFC hardware/feature ?
 I&#x27;d appreciate any teaching from you guys

                              <span>So long story short…I’m the sole IT guy at a nonprofit. Walked in the door and everything is dated, 2960’s, Sophos acting as router and FW and old ruckus wifi that can’t handle zoom calls on my MacBook. I came from a Cisco powerhouse, previous company was all in on them, but they had deep pockets. I was thinking Meraki for the network side, but I also see a lot of mention of Aruba. Looking to replace the above, plus we also have 4-5 other offices with 1-2 switches.
 Thoughts?

I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to do as I have to set a static route to the BGP neighbor via the xfrm that&#x27;s bound to the tunnel. Since I have two ports and two interfaces, I&#x27;m lost on how to configure it. Any thoughts? I understand BGP, but I&#x27;m new to it, so go easy guys.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi we are looking at building a low latency MPLS/WAN deployment. We currently use SDWAN this is great but it runs over the internet. We currently see 15-20ms between sites. We have 2 x RO 5Gb on 10Gb connections at 4 key sites. One issue with this design is the latency is too high for our old applications. The other issue is the MTU is around 1300 usable with the SDWAN headers. 
 What I’m looking for is to put point to point connections between each of the sites. We already have 2 links between 2 of the sites that are 10Gb OSA giving us sub 1ms latency between these sites. This means I need 3 more point to point connections and 2 routers for each site. 
 Total 5 OSA links. 2 already in place. 8 routers with at least 4 x 10Gb connections on each. 
 Any advice or thoughts would be great. Thanks

                              <span>When we’re requested to perform an internal loopback for a carrier to their customer (since we perform last mile for them) it seems there’s a different procedure for our wavelength devices that we monitor through EPNM. Another department sets the loop and I believe I hear both customer and carrier need to be sending light. Could someone that understands this process perhaps provide a little detail as to how this works?

                              <span>Im designing a huge building with upwards 3000 switches on the Access layer. The distance between the access layer and thr core switches exceeds the limitation of Multimode optics (upwards of 1km). To minimize the cost of Single mode transceivers i have decided to add a distribution layer in the middle. This, in addtion to now enabling MM optics , enables better segregation of the network as I can bring L3 closer to the access layer.
 Client however does not like the distribution layer i the middle and whats to go Sm between Access and core.
 Still trying to convince the client that the 3 tier topology is best. Are there other advantages than the ones ive mentioned?
 P.S the core switches are big enough to handle either topology.

I thought about sniffing traffic and the MTU should be the largest fragmented packet, but this feels too complex and might be wrong for some of the interfaces. Is there a MTU negotiation protocol so I can find it easily? Or any other easy way for determining MTU only by sending/ receiving packets? Thanks in advanced!

 I have a few questions about the Mikrotik CCR2004-16G-2S+. I would like to run the router in a data center and was wondering, if it supports LACP and having multiple ports for just a single network? Also, is it suitable for Mass-IP-Whitelisting? I&#x27;m planning to give it instructions on what IP addresses to allow via API.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have a 2 switch stack of 5120&#x27;s. I no longer have enough ports in use to retain both in the stack and want to remove one. (Also, that switch has a fan failure). The switch I want to remove contains the SFP. I did some reading and am still a little fuzzy on what is going to happen. I have a spare sfp to move into the switch I plan to keep. My thoughts are:
 Backup Config
 Power down switch, install new sfp, configure vlans.
 Backup config
 Power back down and remove the stacking cable.
 Look in irf and look for &quot;missing&quot; switch and remove.
 Does this sound correct? Will the remaining switch automatically retain the config along with the ip address that is already assigned?
 Anything else I am missing or not thinking of?
 Thanks for any advice/assistance.

                              <span>At the moment we are looking for an improvement in our data centers. We have two separated DCs that have redundant layer 2 dark fiber connections (not in use). In both datacenters are collapsed core topologies which are then connected to the campus core. The datacenter Vlans are routed from the respective collapsed core, i.e. the SVIs are located on the core VPC pair. The VPC peers share the gateway IP using HSRP.
 Since we want to connect both datacenters with layer 2 and the vlans should be available in both datacenters to move VMs back and forth comfortably, the question is how to solve this in the smartest way. My extensive internet research, unfortunately, has not brought a perfect solution. In addition, the documentation is often outdated (OTV/DCI etc.).
 One often mentioned possibility is to have 2 gateways in the DCs with two HSRP groups, but this does not seem to be a suitable solution. I was thinking of pulling another layer into the topology, so that the collapsed core layer becomes the aggregation layer. Above then comes a real core layer with all SVIs and again HSRP gateway. One VPC peer of the core layer would then be in the first DC and the other VPC peer in the second DC.
 Does anyone have an idea or a suggestion or is there no getting around VXLAN for such concepts nowadays ?

 I&#x27;m in the process of implementing a network which has QoS enabled. We want to test all 1G interfaces at a high utilisation (99%) and passing the results to the customer. The testers being used are Exfo FTB-1 devices
 See below link to image of the network topology, the test scenarios and utilisation results.
 https://i.ibb.co/pyXvkZG/Ether-BERT-Test-Setup.jpg
 I’ve noticed an issue when testing the 1G interfaces of ROUTER-01 via the SWITCHES. I’m only seeing 76% utilisation when I expected closer to 100%. On further diagnosis using our testers, I am only passing 10% though the ROUTER-01 1G interfaces and then only 10% from SWITCH-01 via the interface ROUTER-01 connects to.
 I feel it may be related to the QoS config limiting the traffic (particularly the traffic testing at 10%…</span>

                              <span>Is it possible to have to APs connect and behave as if they were a very expensive Ethernet cable?
 I have two devices in different rooms that require an Ethernet connection, but there’s no physical connection to one of the rooms. Can I use a wifi ap to send wifi into that room, then pick it up with another AP and connect that to a switch/devices etc?

                              <span>The company I&#x27;m working for is attempting to set up a connection between a control shack and a piece of equipment wirelessly. They have purchased 2 Silex AP-100AH (which appear to be 802.11ah wireless access points) to communicate with each other between the equipment and the control shack.
 Is it possible for these two pieces of equipment to actually communicate with each other? It&#x27;s my (limited) understand that WAP&#x27;s can&#x27;t communicate with each other (unless they have a bridging feature). Am I wrong to think we need at least one BR-100AH which is a wireless bridge? What would the optimal network topography look like for this arrangement? Thanks!

                              <span>I am preparing to install some nexus 9ks to replace our old nexus hardware. While I don&#x27;t plan on making many changes during the upgrade process I am trying to get a feel for what I could be with them. So far I have been looking into potentially moving toward VXLAN and possibly leveraging guestshell to do occasional validation testing of network throughput using iperf or something. Not sure what I could use as a client to test against a 100gb network, but the switches are very oversized currently.
 However I know there is a lot more I could look into. Even if I don&#x27;t use it I enjoy learning interesting things and what I learn today will likely get used when the next absurd network requirement is asked. This is my first time having the opportunity to plot the future of a smaller datacenter and I don&#x27;t want the network to ever be the reason why something can&#x27;t be done (hence the current plans for VXLAN).
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions or avenues of research!

                              <span>I went down a rabbit hole the other day looking at PVLANs after dismissing them as not useful for me about 15 years ago. I can see some corner cases where they could be useful but they often just seemed unnecessary. It seemed like a way to drive segmentation without having to resubnet. 
 What use cases have people used them in?

 Simple networking question
 Hey, all. I’d consider myself to have intermediate network knowledge and I need some advice. …
 Currently I purchase 2 static IPs from my business internet provider. I use one for my public router, the other is for the company’s Fortigate which tunnels to corporate. The setup has worked well, but I’m slightly limited. 
 Since I’ve converted to VoIP, our non business class routers don’t do a good job handling traffic for 10 phones, even with QoS on and SIP disabled. 
 Currently, I’ve migrated the phones to behind the WAN. The Fortigate handles them much better, but I’m limited. There are blocked ports, some of which affect phone provisioning. The Fortigate is corporately controlled. I’m able to access the UI, but it’s connected to FortiManager for its config. Making any changes that large would throw a big red flag. 
 Should I keep the two statics, or should I save money and migrate to a single DHCP? If so, what can I put behind the modem to manage traffic (on the cheap!). Can I provision a managed switch to handle the ISP, QoS for the phones, and separate the traffic for the Fortigate? Do I have to buy something expensive like a Ubiquiti VLAN capable device? I’m open to any ideas.

I looked in to PowerShell but it won’t work, at least not with my PS capabilities.

It seems that a lot of these programs are built into the HR software, like ADP and BambooHR which we really don’t want. Can I get some recommendations or some ideas on how to get a handle on this?

Of course, it should be possible to check a box somewhere and have them auto-enroll the next time a domain user logs on, but from everything I&#x27;ve found, it isn&#x27;t. I have to either AAD unjoin/rejoin the devices, or have the users sign up manually -- either is a pain for remote devices that are scattered everywhere. I&#x27;m hoping someone can tell me I&#x27;m wrong. If I&#x27;m not wrong, I&#x27;d love to know a good reason (security or whatever) that this isn&#x27;t possible, because I just don&#x27;t get it, and the situation must come up all the time.

                              <span>This small company started to use AWS services like EC2 and S3, then they moved their e-mail service to Microsoft 365 Business, and now that some things need to be changed in AWS we decided to switch from AWS to Azure instead.
 Since the company already uses Microsoft 365, that somehow uses the Azure infrastructure, is there any particular method I should use when creating the Azure account?
 I&#x27;m going to keep searching and ask the Microsoft 365 support, but any tip coming from this sub will be really helpful.
 Thank you in advance.

 We have full credit card and drivers license inmformation stored insecurely in our POS system. I notified our CIO who notified our CFO and only new information has stopped being entered because I told the staff doing it to stop. They&#x27;re still storing physical copies and information that was uploaded has not been removed.
 We&#x27;re only reporting a single IP address to our PCI auditor (we have more than 100.) I and another team member notified our CIO and he has taken no action to remedy this situation.

                              <span>not sure if this is the proper forum or not, but I took the angle as the populus here has some influence in decision making of this type so looking more for an answer from a personal experience type of level
 So one of my other challenges is hardware vendors switching to subscription support models and software vendors ditching prpertual licensing for that sweet...sweet stock inflating continuous revenue stream (I&#x27;m looking at you Citirx and VMware!)
 We&#x27;re currently looking into upgrading our current Exchange 2013 environment (yes...I know its EOL beginning of April...grrrrr) and were looking into on-prem for depreciation and CAPex, but that was deemed too expensive so the upper&#x27;s considered O365 because it was a less expensive hit this year as OPex.
 Now, the C-suite is involved and I can&#x27;t do anything while it is discussed further. Discussions have been going on for over a year and a half and I am still at square one when either way, I could have been done already.
 I mean...it&#x27;s not like Email is a lifeblood of a business or anything /s
 My question...is it possible to depreciate expenses like O365 and subscription VMware/Citrix licensing?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Luckily for me, I am a part of a company that decided to cheap out on their VoIP implementation, meaning we are using a system that is horribly outdated. We are using a &quot;Zulty&#x27;s&quot; system that has a phone app you can download, but half the time it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.
 For example, if you receive a phone call, answer it, then end the call, you have to be sure you re-open the app, or else you will be stuck on &quot;On the phone&quot; status, meaning any additional phone calls will not ring to the app until you open the app again.
 So, my question is, has anyone ever had to deal with a situation where you need to route it through something else? Even if it is to route it through something like Google Voice, etc. we are dealing with a call group (our helpdesk line) that is hit or miss if the person on-call is receiving the phone call, because the app is terrible.
 My experience with VoIP is limited as you may be able to tell, but any suggestions are great. We can&#x27;t move to another system with just that number / phone group as it&#x27;s a part of a contract, however just being able to get a phone call through something whether it&#x27;s through another app that is better would make our lives so much easier.
 Thanks if you have any ideas!

                              <span>I’m still fairly new to IT and am tasked with preparing Windows laptops for new employees and replacements. 
 I’ve been doing the prep manually, but would like to switch to automating this terribly slow process, which includes:
  
Windows/driver updates
 8-10 App installs
 Debloating 
 Admin account creation, Name change, etc.
  
They don’t need to connect to a domain/GPO or use O365 licenses, just installing an agent for communicating with our remote mgt solution (not Intune).
 Would FOG, WDS-MDT, or another free solution be best? I’ve used VMs before and imaging drives with dd but prepping ready-to-go images is new to me. 
 Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Currently I&#x27;m working on my final exam project and the goal is to set up a Hyper-V-Cluster with a single Storage of a iSCSI-Server. Somehow I had in mind to split the operating system on a raid-1 and the iSCSI-storage on a raid-5 oder raid-6.
 the iSCSI-Server itself has 8 times 480GB hard drives.
 ​
 Now I&#x27;m not sure if this even makes sense anymore. Should I put every hard drive into 1 raid or makes it sense to split it up?

                              <span>So. My current org is a bit of a hoarder and we&#x27;re clearing out space for new projects. And are throwing out about 2 shelves worth of PDP-11 documentation manuals.
 I&#x27;m too young (1995) to properly know what is there. But most of it seems to be about NSX-11 which seems to be a 1970&#x27;s real-time OS for PDP-11 computers. As well as some Fortran references for it also. 
 Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have the time or space to store it. To consider digitising them. I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s valuable.
 So ideally, I was hoping to try sell to a collector. But would definitely consider just giving it to a good home and maybe pay shipping (depending on location). I&#x27;d just hate to see it destroyed if it still has value.

                              <span>I am currently managing an Exchange Server 2016 that is working in hybrid with Office Online. However, the server is old and slow. I am considering decommissioning the server and moving to Exchange Online only. I wanted to share my thoughts and get some feedback on whether this is possible or the correct way to go about things.
 First, let me explain a bit about my current setup. Our organization has been using Exchange Server 2016 for several years now, and we implemented a hybrid deployment with Office Online. This allows us to have the benefits of both on-premises and cloud-based Exchange, including password and directory synchronization. 
 However, as we continue to evaluate our IT infrastructure, we are considering moving to Exchange Online only. There are several reasons for this, including cost savings, security, and reliability.
 So, is it possible to decommission the Exchange Server 2016 and move to Exchange Online only? We want to keep our AD syncing with Azure and our passwords syncing. I read this article (below) that says we should keep an Exchange server online, but we are at the point where I&#x27;d either need to spin up some new VMs or go Exchange Online only.

                              <span>Client has about 75,000 users that need access to between 2 and 6 platforms each. Currently we run a SAML IDP with a custom authentication process that reads from multiple databases, no central user storage or management, authentication is a function of a matching email existing in certain locations and the values of various database columns.
 There is no single source of truth for user information. Would like to store users in one place along with roles/permissions management. We transmit some of these as SAML attributes currently, sending what is relevant to each service provider.
 Most of these users are low value, not paying customers or employees and the client deemed Okta too expensive, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d go above $0.25 per user but they&#x27;ll happily pay tens of thousands for us to set up something free.
 It&#x27;s not exactly my wheelhouse and I&#x27;d be doing this entirely on my own with a restrictive timeline/budget so I need some advice. Would like to stick with SAML auth since I know it works on all things users need access to and I have a decent understanding of it at this point. Could Azure AD suit these needs? That&#x27;s my 2nd choice after Okta but the presentation to me as a developer isn&#x27;t as clear.
 I&#x27;m leaning towards a cloud product recommendation and help setting it up vs something we&#x27;ll have to install, configure, host and maintain, because of the severely limited resources, but may have to go with something self-hosted due to budget constraints.

 ​
 This script first defines the name of the app to be blocked. It then gets the path to the startup folder for the current user&#x27;s Terminal Service profile from the registry. If the startup folder exists, the script checks if the app is already there, and if so, it exits. If the app is not there, it creates a shortcut to the app and adds it to the startup folder. Finally, the script outputs a message indicating that the app has been blocked on startup.

                              <span>Hello fellow admins! I&#x27;m experiencing the strangest issue with my Lenovo Slim 7 Carbon. Intermittant touchpad operation. It just seems to &#x27;lose&#x27; my finger. I thought maybe it&#x27;s dirty, or dirty fingers, but for some reason, I&#x27;ll be moving my pointer and suddenly it stops. I then have to wait for it to decide to work again. No issue with using multi-fingers to scroll, zoom, etc. Just the single finger Has anyone else experienced this? As you can imagine, this has made remote access more challenging than usual when I can&#x27;t use a mouse.

                              <span>I have a windows server with a data volume that’s over 200TB that I need to back up. I am aware of MS 64TB VSS limitation and my go to Veeam backup won’t work. Is there any software out there that would allow me to backup this volume? I am backing up to a storage server running FreeNAS. Any suggestions would be much appreciated

                              <span>Ok, so I&#x27;ve been in this space for a few years, and have worked with servers from HP, Dell, Cisco, even a smattering of supermicro and fujitsu. But we got about 40 servers from Lenovo about two years ago, and they have been nothing but a constant headache. Which fine, A bad firmware here, a faulty driver there, it has happened with all of them. The problem comes down to the support. 
 Their support has NO clue what they are doing, Every time we call in, we have to explain the situation to them multiple times, We demonstrate the problem to them, and they cannot comprehend what the issue is. Like they&#x27;ve never done break/fix before in their lives, and so troubleshooting steps are foreign to them. Their knee jerk reaction to any issue is a motherboard swap. We&#x27;ve had the motherboard on a system replaced 7 and 8 times without resolving the very obviously firmware issue. 
 The techs they send out are all contract, and other than replacing system boards have no knowledge or desire to do anything beyond swapping boards, there have been several times they have failed to update serial numbers and other things (I believe they have all been IBM techs). 
 The newest experience has me laughing, We opened a ticket for a power supply gone bad, and they somehow confused us with another company, and Now we&#x27;re invited to a teams meeting monday for their issue. 
 Has anybody had a good experience with Lenovo support for servers? any tips? 
 When I did desktop support, I LOVED Lenovo thinkpad support, they had amazing support processes, and super knowledgeable people, fast response times, etc. It has been the exact opposite with the servers.

                              <span>I launched a software licensing service not that long ago. As a Software Vendor (I made a desktop app that I was looking to to sell), I found existing Software Licensing solutions (FlexLM, Sentinel, Wibu, Nalpeiron) were either prohibitively expensive to adopt and difficult to use, or just didn&#x27;t have sufficiently robust capability.
 I think looking at it from the software Vendor&#x27;s perspective is only part of the problem, since many end users also complain about licensing (more so than the vendors!). Looking through other threads, some of the big issues that kept coming up seem to be:
 - Easier to &quot;steal&quot; rather than install and activate correctly
 - Difficult to get buy in from higher ups to switch to a software with easier to work with licensing policies. We&#x27;re talking monolithic On-Prem License servers with UI from the 90s that have never been updated used to enforce concurrency.
 - There is no single agreed upon standard, every ISV might have their own definitions for floating licenses, a seat, or a user-based license provisioning. This inconsistency makes SAM automation a nightmare.
 - ISVs sometimes prefer to prevent piracy rather than deploy in an environment that they cannot control (in a VM, for example).
 - Hardware Dongles aren&#x27;t going away.
 - Node Locking fails often for many reasons (MAC address isn&#x27;t persistent; you attach a new dock and the device fingerprint changes etc.). 
 What else could be improved to make licensing software less of a headache for everyone? #opensource

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 We are looking at deploying WPA3 on our APs for our AD managed devices.
 Currently have an 802.1x WPA2 GPO with computer cert based authentication setup.
 Issue running into is our DCs are still server 2016, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to setup WPA3 within the GPO settings. Server 2022 does have that option for WPA3, so would it be possible to just introduce a brand new 2022 VM into our DC environment to apply these settings? Planning on upgrading all DCs to 2022 by the end of this year, but just want to start testing WPA3 802.1x right now.
 Thanks!

 We’re backing his NAS of 26 TB up to backblaze at the moment. Have any of you run into a company storing large active media files and if so what was your storage solution for a good price and what did the workflow look like?

 Intune support is no help
 365 audit closest thing is &quot;users sign into mailbox&quot; only. I have users that access devices but wont open email if i paid them.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Lately I have been dealing with a ton of miscommunications and issues arising from users of all levels just not reading an email I have sent to either inform them of something or asking for clarification. 
 Things like &quot;Hey I tried calling but you weren&#x27;t at your desk. I left a voicemail and this email is a follow up when can we meet to get thing done&quot; only for a few days later I get a call from a supervisor on how I hadn&#x27;t got thing done cause user never responded to me
 ​
 to multiple emails about people needing to set up their new account for something only to have someone furious at me that they where never made aware of new account and they don&#x27;t have time to create a username and password.
 ​
 Even simple things like asking for clarification on a problem, then not hearing from a person till they walk by 3 days later and ask if i have a solution for their problem that I wasn&#x27;t even sure what the issue was. 
 ​
 Even in the last staff meeting I mentioned I would distribute my quick presentation via email only to loudly hear an employee say &quot;Well no one reads your emails anyway&quot; 
 ​
 I have been looking for my out (though i know this problem is everywhere) but it seriously just makes me feel like i am losing my mind when things end up being My fault cause someone doesn&#x27;t read their email.

 Then employee B does 3000 tickets in a year, has feedback on 40 of them, and has worse numbers because he&#x27;s exposed to more tickets and customers. Would you still just take the average rating based on the amount of feedback tickets received? Picture of reference of what i&#x27;m referring to:

 Jeez, navigating this comment section is a minefield. Seems like a lot of people are drawing conclusions from me asking a question, when I didn&#x27;t necessarily say anything like that. So to answer a couple questions:
  
I have to present SOMETHING to upper management when I&#x27;m justify a pay increase or promotion, or the opposite. KPI&#x27;s are necessary unfortunately. I wish I could…</span>

 New integration to enable Zoom + Meet interop (if you have conference hardware for either) to join one type of meeting from the other.
 Something I&#x27;ve been waiting for in the last few years but can finally put the pitchforks away. Turned it on for the org and it was seamless in picking up Meet links in my calendar invite (we are a Zoom org with Mac minis/iPads as conference hardware, Google Workspace as calendar source).

                              <span>Hi all. A small company I help has moved all users to Passwordless . Now they ask how to get emails on their iPhones. App passwords no longer work as basic auth is disabled.
 Any advice? Thanks
 UPDATE: So far, the option of using TAP (suggested by u/zm1868179) seems to be the best option to try. So far, looks promising; although the TAP is supposed to stay active for 60 minutes, my outlook profile on iPhone is still active and still fetching mails. Not sure when the system will ask to log in again, but definitely not after 60 minutes. Will update the post.
 P.S. TAP is cumbersome as this has to be created by an admin, but it is kind of okay for a small company

                              <span>So I was using Nutanix X-ray to test some brand new clusters this week. Some of my tests were failing vMotion. Backup system grabs any VM not in a policy and backs it up to a default policy. Network was super slow this morning. Net team found our backup clusters were maxing out the wan. The test VMs which are terabytes in size were backed up and were being replicated to other sites. I owned up to it and we all had a good laugh.

 We&#x27;re being tasked with deploying it for easier onboarding.
 I&#x27;ve found some tutorials here and there but looking for some formal training that I can give to a team for everyone to get brought up to speed.
 Any recommendations other than digging through MS docs and watching youtube videos?

                              <span>I am looking for patching tools that support schedules based on X days after Patch Tuesday such as AWS Maintenance Windows or Syxsense.
 Example: Test Environment A would patch 3 days after patch Tuesday. Prod Environment A would patch 12 days after patch Tuesday.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a decent patch tool for a multi-domain multi-site enterprise environment that supports this capability?
 Ideally the tool would be able to patch Windows and Linux OS environments as well as third party software (Acrobat Reader, Zip utilities, ect), but the biggest need at this point is Windows OS updates.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently transferred from one university division to another. In this new division I work in, they have never had an IT guy. Concepts like ticketing systems, remoting systems, and no access to admin for the average user is very foreign to them. I&#x27;m the single IT guy for about 300 users. This division has many departments.
 Active Directory was a mess. I&#x27;ve mostly straightened that out and reorganized OUs and such. They finally agreed to the purchase of a ticketing system. That got funded today....Really happy about that. I am sick of getting calls, emails, team messages, skype messages, texts, and office pop-ins. They are finally receptive to purchasing a remoting system. 
 But what really pushes my buttons are that the Leadership is stubborn on wanting all users to have administrative access to everything! I&#x27;ve showed them university SOPs. I&#x27;ve cited my state&#x27;s government SOPs on admin credentials. I&#x27;ve told them I do not fill comfortable trading convenience for security. 
 My reasoning for posting this would be to ask for advice. Does anyone have any &quot;scary&quot; stories I can let my leadership read. I&#x27;m looking for cautionary tales that will scare them into submission! Also looking for advice on how to handle these asshats!
 Thanks

                              <span>After 20 years with all our stuff in the same server room I have the opportunity to design a new one. This is not a major installation, no raised floor CRAC or fancy fire suppression system. What might I incorporate into the design and layout to make things a bit more efficient and my life a little easier?
 Space is not finalized yet but it will be a minimum of 180 SF for four racks. Maybe a lot more. I will be installing ladder racks and Netfloor tiles. I will install new Ethernet throughout the office area too. It will have redundant cooling and a dedicated electrical subpanel.
 If enough space is available I plan to install a standing bench for equipment staging and diagnostic work.
 -edited to add, I did a very thorough cost analysis of moving to colo or public cloud, not going to happen-
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Looking to deploy a handful of MDE Plan 2 licenses to a few endpoints for some testing, turned on the 25 license pack trial and assigned the license to a few endpoints, deployed the necessary Intune configuration policies to turn on EDR and right away noticed that it unlocked some security reporting UI features across all devices.
 As an example the advanced threat hunting schema tables now include Device prefixed tables, and it has details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for P2.
 My intention is to keep most devices on Plan 1 while having a subset of devices on Plan 2. 
 Why is the portal letting me see details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for the higher tier? Is there some setting that can restrict this and filter out the noise down to P2 licensed devices only.

                              <span>Does anyone have an easy way that they update Reader DC for the company? All new installs have auto update and install set on by default but our laptops don&#x27;t stay on for a full 3 days so the timer resets and I have machines that are out by several versions. I have been looking online for powershells or just using the installer but those options don&#x27;t seem to work anymore. Adobe on their websites just says to open the menu and check for updates. I don&#x27;t want to have to do this on every machine. I have everything else automated for updates in our domain but Adobe. I use PDQ Deploy/Inventory if that helps.
 So back to my point, does anyone have a way to force a manual update for Adobe Reader DC?

                              <span>Several of our systems are erroring out with Defender updates this morning. In particular, 1.383.1462.0. We keep getting 0x80070643 errors.
 I&#x27;ve tried resetting WU on the system, redownloading the update, and manually triggering the update as explained in https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates.
 Anyone else?

                              <span>Hi, title is somewhat misleading
 I want to get certified, as of now i was sort of just thrown into the IT part of my job as i was &quot;good with computers&quot; and to be honest i love it, i&#x27;ve been doing it for the better part of 5 years now, setting up Intune, managing O365, creating a hybrid environment, setting up servers, FTP, Azure, Print servers, file servers, etc.. 
 I&#x27;ve been thinking/studying to take AZ-900 but what other Certifications would you recommend which would help me prove that i know what i say i know if you catch my drift.
 I would like to learn more about Security and Microsoft as well as Networking
 I did think about taking Security+ and CCNA but as i dont do any Networking in my job it&#x27;s hard to learn it as i&#x27;m not working with it daily
 Thank you for reading and your response! And thank you for any tips!

                              <span>So we have a client that uses an email to send personal information and documents to their clients. They specified that the email has to be able to send encrypted messages and multiple users need to be able to read and reply back to emails from it. No problem! we can set it up as a shared mailbox, and enable encryption on it.
 However, a phone call with the user, she also now mentions that she also needs her front desk to be able to log into the account to send scanned documents from this email and not just a shared email. This makes it a little more complicated because you now have to have a license attached to it for it to be logged into. No worries though, we can do this we just enable MFA (Now that it&#x27;s going to be physically able to be logged into), give read/send permissions to the needed users so they can access from their email, and enable Encryption on the email. All done!
 Third call with the user comes, she now mentions that the email will be used for SMTP from a 3rd party with their application that they use to send out contracts, documents, etc. This is where it gets complicated, I have no idea how to keep this email secure with MFA (As far as my understanding, SMTP will not work with MFA enabled), we now can&#x27;t change the password, or it&#x27;s going to break the application from sending emails, and now we have 4 different people inside of this email that has access to personal, sensitive information.
 So my question is, how would you go about it to make this account secure and meet the requirements. We can make another account if needed and makes sense to do so.
 Requirements
 1) Allow SMTP
 2) Possibly Disable Login, if not then enable MFA.
 3) Allow shared account access from multiple users.

                              <span>I have a Dell R540 12 bay with 1 CPU and 96GB of RAM, it also has a Boss card and a 4 x 1Gb NIC installed in the raiser card slots. 
 I noticed there is a PCIe 16 slow with two other 4 or 8x slots betside it that are beside the riser slot. Does anyone know if these slots work and how do I add cards because I installed a intel x520-DA2 into it and the ports blink on the outside of the card but the card isn&#x27;t seen by the system bios, idrac, nor Windows which is very odd!?

                              <span>Not technically sysadmin, so please delete if not allowed. I have asked in r/cybersecurity, but you guys are also knowledgable, so asking here too.
 I&#x27;d like start hosting some cyber-security competitions for some kids. Something like these: https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/guides/top-cybersecurity-competitions/, but ones that I control to whip out and use outside of competition days.
 Essentially, the way I see it working is that I produce a linux VM, make some insecure changes (no updates, passwords changed to 1234, password requirements, chmod 777 some config files, random executable in home dir, no anti-virus, etc.) and then get the kids to find and fix those changes, and get scored on the number of fixes they do.
 I can do all this with scripts etc. to check various scenarios and build the images, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any ideas on where to start or if they have an idea of scoring or any issues that should be included.
 Thanks in advance!

 I tried preparing the text in a mail and then copy &amp; pasted it over into the field however, the final notification mail then has no formatting at all. No line-breaks etc.

There is an IP in /ets/resolv.conf that can be used to access Windows but firewall blocks all requests from WSL by default, after some digging i could not find a way to fix it with firewall rules so i tried to disable firewall just for WSL&#x27;s virtual network adapter and it worked.
 Here is powershell command, that i use: Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Public -DisabledInterfaceAliases &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot;
 I does the thing as i said but the problem is that every time i disable/enable firewall with it, firewall spits out permission prompts for every program that i already permitted before. Sometimes it is very annoying, especeially when permissions are reset for my DLNA and network sharing sevices and i can no longer access my PC via local network.
 Is there something that i&#x27;m doing wrong? Would appreciate any advice on how to configure firewall to allow outbound requests from WSL environment without having to explicitly set permissions for every program again every time.

 All the above make changes/decisions that we here in support are not consulted or have any input on - we only find out when the shit hits the fan - how do I go about remeding this so my guys aren&#x27;t always firefighting - I&#x27;m not the TL (our TL in non-technical) But I&#x27;m the &quot;go to&quot; guy when it comes to issues. 
 ​
 Any &amp; all suggestions appreciated!

                              <span>Has anyone else noticed a big uptick in Microsoft 365 sign in issues reported the past two weeks for people running Windows?
 ​
 Various apps from Word, Outlook, Excel to OneDrive all repeatedly prompting to sign in with their M365 credentials over and over. 
 ​
 Not seeing any pattern to as it seems to be impacting all Windows clients from local AD joined, AD joined with AADconnect sync, AzureAD Joined, Windows Hello, Regular password, or even basic workgroup. All same problem all in the past two weeks all different M365 tenants.
 ​
 ​
 The workaround is to 
  
open Word and click File - Account - Sign out all accounts
 
Then log off, log back in as a different local admin account and delete the folder: C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPluginxxxxx\
 
Then reboot and log back in to Windows profile and sign back into the apps again.
 
 ​
 But even with that some people get the problem again the following day.
 ​
 Anyone else seeing this?

                              <span>What do you use to document your network visually? What types of views do you create? Do you need any view to show to your boss (you know, to feel informed and &#x27;in control&#x27;)? Are you using any of them for NOC display or do you prefer dashboards like Grafana?
 The customer I am helping right now has created some simple diagrams about memory, CPU etc for switches, some temperature sensors from the server room, and UPC battery levels as tracked in the software they use for monitoring. This is, however, some really old version of the software and the view with diagrams needs to be scrolled so no use in displaying them on the monitor screen. Also, they need something to show/display to the boss which is rather general, and colorful but &#x27;not too alarming&#x27; (should not be screaming about some newly detected problem too early, more like day average situation overview).
 Any advice? What would you put on the &#x27;boss dashboard&#x27; about your network? What type of view would you do just to help you/your colleagues do their job?

                              <span>Hi all, I hope I&#x27;m allowed to ask this here, if not please let me know where I might be able to find help. 
 I started an internship a few months ago and was tasked with setting up a HA cluster with a few test servers, after about 2 or 3 weeks I figured it out and got it set up. Keep in mind I am studying Computer Science, so my knowledge on networking and system administration is limited, honestly not sure why they gave me this work to do. 
 Now a few days ago they gave me access to a live server they want me to set up and I ran into an error I don&#x27;t know how to fix. 
 I am using two Window server 2019 and running mssql 2019. I wanted to set up the failover cluster, but when running the validate configuration wizard, I get this error:
 DHCP status for network interface &#x27;servername&#x27;.&#x27;domainname&#x27; - Ethernet0 differs from network Cluster Network 1.
 The servername and domainname is filled in, but I just left it blank for security reasons 
 I have tried googling the problem, but I&#x27;m not getting any luck there. Also no one in the office knows how to work with databases, and the one guy that does kinda know what is going on, is very busy with other stuff so I can&#x27;t bother him too much.

                              <span>Hi,
 This has been something I&#x27;ve been breaking my head over the last few days:
 - Newly installed VEEAM v12 server on Server 2022, no firewall active, 3 NIC&#x27;s in an LACP trunk. VLAN dedicated for the connection to the backup repo, VLAN for management of the backup server.
 - Newly installed Linux repository server, firewall disabled (for testing), installation of veeam agent went fine through SSH, LACP bond of 4 NIC&#x27;s untagged in backup VLAN.
 - I can SSH into the linux repo from the BS, no problem.
 - Trying to create a backup gives a connection error on port 2501 and it fails.
 - netstat on the linux host shows a connection from BS ip to host on port 2500 and 2502... 
 netsstat -tulpna | grep veeam
 tcp6 0 0 192.168.30.11:2500 192.168.30.10:65210ESTABLISHED 21672/veeamagent
 tcp6 0 0 192.168.30.11:6162 192.168.30.10:65311ESTABLISHED 20282/veeamtranspor
 tcp6 0 156 192.168.30.11:2502 192.168.30.10:65313 ESTABLISHED 21881/veeamagent
 ​
 Any suggestions on the cause?

                              <span>Most backup software lets you do synthetic backups where your client backup is &quot;incremental forever&quot; but every so often a full backup is assembled.
 How often are you running those full backups and especially with workloads that are large but with a low change rate where you&#x27;re just backing up the same TBs of data every time you take a full backup.
 I guess there&#x27;s no right answer just trying to read the room on where it&#x27;s headed.

                              <span>Since The Breach Of All Breaches in December October August, we have been investigating alternatives to LastPass.
 So far we&#x27;ve explored Bitwarden and 1Password, and I&#x27;ve also had a couple of brief flings with NordPass and Dashlane. None of them come up to feature parity with LastPass, but 1Password&#x27;s security architecture was compelling.
 However, last week I came across Keeper, and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve found that is enterprisey enough to have everything we&#x27;re after, without being a full blown PAM/PAW solution like CyberArk. 
 The features we&#x27;re after are:
  
Azure AD integration for login and user provisioning
 Custom templates for records
 Granular sharing
 Ease of use for &#x27;normal&#x27; users
 Actually secure
  
Does anyone having any experience with Keeper to either say they&#x27;d recommend it, or recommend completely avoiding it?
 I&#x27;ve heard bad things about their Firefox plugin, but I will be doing a trial personally to validate that.
 Also, does anyone know of any in depth security assessments carried out by independent security experts that can validate that their security architecture is good?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to write small programs most likely with simple GUIs that I can put on other computers. (For now just simple things like editing a value in .ini or .xml files, etc). Python is my go-to but since that requires having Python installed on the PC it&#x27;s running on...
 Is it worth trying to learn batch or PowerShell, or seeing if I can transform Python scripts into .exes? Or perhaps something else entirely?

                              <span>One of our clients is experiencing an issue I haven&#x27;t come across often on MS365.
 There is a shared mailbox used by the sales team. Periodically they&#x27;ll get hit with waves of 50-100 per hour bounce-back notifications or &quot;Mail Delivery Failure&quot; messages. It&#x27;s all mail servers responding with limited details, as in they don&#x27;t include the original message, and from what I can tell the headers are not original so I can&#x27;t glean much info.
 I&#x27;m still not 100% certain if this is originating with us. I&#x27;d like to confirm if someone has gained access to the outgoing SMTP and is sending from our mail server or if it&#x27;s spoofed emails being bounced back to our spoofed email address.
 Does anyone have any helpful advice?
 The only useful info I&#x27;ve found so far on the backend is that &quot;Real-Time Detections&quot; show the incoming &quot;Mail Delivery Failure&quot; emails as quarantined malware emails. It lists us as the recipient and the mail servers as the senders.
 Where do I go from here?

                              <span>I often see rants here about working conditions. So here is mine!
 I LOVE my job. We have a strong development team that is super fun! We go for drinks, talk shop, talk smack and in general have a good time! We support each other when we need to complain about feces for brains business people and help each other when needed.
 My job itself is very challenging and I get a lot of freedom in developing our infrastructure. The expertise in our team is skyhigh and I learn everyday. Every few months when I look back and I am amazed at how much I learned. I am allowed to make mistakes, no hard feelings. 
 Our team leads have vision for the future and know how to communicate this. As far as I can tell this vision is in line with the developments in our field.
 I get to be responsible for processes and I get to criticize policy and processes. If spearhead an effort to change something people listen with an open mind. Often people will think along with me and enable me to actually make a difference. 
 I work exclusively with Linux systems we fully administer ourselves. The only windows in my life is the labtop because thats policy. 
 The lunch at work is cheap and amazing in quality for what you pay. 
 Sure there are bad days and good days. The business is terrible at software development lifecycle. We get involved way too late. There are large problems with understaffing in our team. But in general the good far outweighs the bad. 
 I LOVE my job.

 If you agree with the idea, what do you write?

 The app essentially reads the settings from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App.
 Problem is that all computer accounts are in a single OU and it&#x27;s beyond my decision &amp; control to re-organize them in different OUs. And the requirement is the App needs to be configured based on user&#x27;s role, so it needs to be User-specific settings. Computer is shared by multiple users shift work.
 What could be some creative ways to allow the app to be configurable via domain GPO and User-specific? Some ideas...
  
Insert them into HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App but the App would not read it there.
 PowerShell script on login to apply the settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App. But the settings also needs to be cleared on logoff so the next user&#x27;s settings can be applied? Or maybe clearing the settings isn&#x27;t necessary since the next user&#x27;s settings will just get re-applied.
 Etc...

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a DevOps consultant since late 2021. So far it has been un-fulfilling. I basically did this because everyone on my team left my old job aside from a couple people, including my manager leaving and it was the only easy option to get off the sinking ship. I&#x27;ve been a Systems Engineer previously for about 10 or so years.
 I can either go back to my old job possibly but no one on my team is there aside from two people, or try to find a new job that is remote only. I&#x27;ve been fortunate that my last 2 jobs out of 3, I&#x27;ve put my heart in and have gotten promotions and been able to do things that helped the company. With my latest it&#x27;s just not the same.
 Has anyone been in the same boat? There are some people that got me here at my current job and I feel like I might burn bridges but I want to have that fire back in. I just feel like I work best devoted my time to fix things at a company as opposed to coming in, doing a project and leaving. I hate the feeling of starting a project with a bunch of new people and rinsing and repeating with other new people. It causes so much anxiety for me. I prefer to go to midsize company and pave the road and make a name for myself (based on my previous jobs this has worked out...)

                              <span>Im trying to come up with a resolution for an issue at work. Im a desktop support engineer but do not have access to configs for the switches. I have an end user whose mapped drives are suppose to connect automatically at start up but they don&#x27;t. The drives show up with red x&#x27;s and only when you click them it turns green. From my understanding windows runs a script at start up when it is configured to connect mapped drives automatically. Is it possible that the windows script is timed to run before the stp forward delay timers reach zero and move the switch port into a forwarding state? If so, portfast is most likely disabled. Just looking for some insight before I decide to escalate this ticket.

                              <span>Aloha all,
 I work out in Hawaii, and we have 2 offices on 2 islands, served by 2 ISP&#x27;s - Office_A is served by HawaiianTel on the island of Maui, and Office_B is served by Spectrum on the island of Oahu.
 Question: why do I get 2 different traceroute results from either location when running a simple traceroute between the 2 sites?
 From Office_A to Office_B, it&#x27;s 14 hops, that actually runs from Maui -&gt; Oahu -&gt; California -&gt; Oahu.
 However, from Office_B to Office_A, it&#x27;s just 9 hops bouncing from router to router on Oahu before heading to Maui.
 Why wouldn&#x27;t the traceroute results be more or less the same?

 Obviously traffic shaping from the ISP is a very possible scenario- but aside from that, there could be issues with the traffic between the ISP and the cloud provider server- right? Of the parties involved, who would be responsible for sorting that out?

                              <span>Ok, so hopefully someone can advise here.
 We have quite a complicated setup which I&#x27;ll miss a lot of information out to keep this brief... we have an OSPF instance (OSPF 20) with our ISP. The ISP advertises several routes to us including a default route and a route to one of our remote branches among DCs.
 We also receive a route to our remote DC from another OSPF instance (OSPF 10) with our internal routers. This is redistributed into OSPF by the neighbor route as an E1 route.
 At present, the route to the remote DC that is making it into the routing table is the one from the ISP (OSPF 20), while we want the traffic to route internally via OSPF 10.
 I&#x27;ve tried a few ways to fix this but can&#x27;t seem to crack it. I though using a route-map against a distribution list on the ISP OSPF instance to set the metric higher would work if I matched the route I was interested in, but it seems to filter out all routes from the ISP EXCEPT the one I want to affect.
 I feel like I&#x27;m missing something crazy obvious here, any chance one of you geniuses can help me out?
 Thanks

                              <span>Networkers of reddit,
 This issue first came up with a client that couldn&#x27;t process their CC transactions after coming back from lunch. Essentially they could not resolve xyz domain and further examination revealed other domains also not being able to be resolved but 95% of domains on the internet are being resolved.
 Ive pegged it down to the Fortigate(s) simply because if we Ethernet into the back of Comcast modem DNS resolves to these specific domains. Alright so then I remembered our own business uses Comcast business and also has a Fortigate 61E and I can reproduce the problem on our network. I even noticed now I cant even hit the slickdeals website to which I was just checking it out last week on my machine. OK so I if i know the IP and setup a forward zone on the DC to the IP for the domain it routes and comes up. If i setup my machines DNS to googles/openDNS/comcast DNS it still will not resolve. If i nslookup using another DNS server besides the domain controller it will not resolve. I feel this eliminates the windows DNS DC(s). Packet captures show the DNS requests going to the DC out so I dont understand why the requests are timing out. I can double check the WAN packet capture but why would it fwd DNS request for certain domains and not others?
 No changes have been made to the Fortigates OS 7.x on any of these separate sites and neither have any web filtering rules other than blocking foreign countries inbound. There are no external connector feeds to 2 of the sites and ive disabled them on our site. I can replicate this problem across 3 different places across the city the only correlation being they are all on comcast business using fortigates across multiple workstations. Software upgrades on the fortigates are manual so I can only think of something being bugged, exploited or i need other ideas. I hope ive explained enough to get some insight from you guys.

                              <span>Ran into a very interesting problem yesterday, so I thought I would share it here. 
 We have a small network in one of our outlying buildings consisting of a Sophos Firewall, and an Aruba switch. There are 3 subnets, LAN, WiFi, and the VPN.
 Yesterday users on the Wifi and VPN subnets were unable to connect to the Server on the LAN subnet, and vice versa. Connections LAN to LAN work flawlessly. No configuration or hardware changes had been made. 
 We noticed after doing some discovery that when attempting to ping PCs on the LAN subnet from any other subnet the packets would timeout 92% of the time. There would be a long series of timeouts, then a brief period (about 30 seconds or so) of connection that would work fine, then the connection would start timing out again for about 8(ish) minut…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re standing up a new site, management didn&#x27;t heed my warnings of lead times issues for our first-pick cisco hardware, so now I&#x27;m scrambling to find an available alternative. I&#x27;ve searched for suggestions between Aruba and Juniper, but I&#x27;m running into a lot of trouble comparing their exact specs. The short of it is, I need a 1RU, 48GBE (SFP+ / multgig a bonus, but not priority), POE+(at least 10 ports), L3 managed(or &quot;2+&quot;), with dual redundant PSU (Field replaceable preferred, but not required). 
 The closest I can tell, I should be looking at the 3810M or EX4100 series, but would really appreciate any input. If anyone could point me to a matrix that actually compares multiple brands, I will send you a digital kiss as well!

                              <span>I have the following collapsed core topology with VRRP helping with the redundancy of the VLANs.

 From my understanding the firewall should be between the nexus switches and a router that performs BGP
 My questions are:
  
Am I right about the placement of the firewall and the BGP router?
 If the firewall doubles as an IPS, does that change anything?
 Does this require 2 firewalls?

 CCNP(some require but being asked less for it)
 R&amp;S: People are asking for Aruba, Extreme, and Arista more and more. 
 Firewalls... Palo and Fortinet ... anything is good 
 NAC: Clearpass or ISE, my forescout experience matters not. 
 NetDevOps: Being asked about Python and Ansible now a lot of the time. 
 Security: Massive Pandora box, asked for anything pretty much.

From what I gather, the mgmt console should be upgraded first and then the actual firewalls. Can I just call support during the upgrade in case it doesn&#x27;t go smoothly or will i need pro services for something like this?

 ​
 Two issues.
  
When trying to &#x27;write&#x27; or &#x27;commit&#x27; get error that Invalid input detected at &#x27;^&#x27; marker

I&#x27;ve tried:
  
disabling BGP, renabling
 Importing config file that I created before making BGP commands

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 I want to activate the service for http redirect while authenticating the PPPoE user that I have terminated on my ASR9K router. What should be the configuration on the ASR9K side?

                              <span>Regardless of which firewall we are using from one of the popular brands like Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, or Sophos Fortinet, PA, Cisco or Sophos, what is the best way to allow a user to establish SSL VPN from only a specific device?
 While researching, I found that many of the admins suggest using PKI certificate-based authentication. However, I am concerned about the downsides of using a cert-based VPN.
 Firstly, certificates have a limited lifespan, which means I will have to monitor the age of all issued certificates continually. 
 This could mean a lot of effort, especially if we have so many VPN users.
 Secondly, not all regular users are knowledgeable enough to install a certificate on their device, which would mean that I would have to bring the device in to have the certificate installed. This could be a repetitive process because the certificate has a definite lifespan.
 Given these concerns, I wanted to ask the community: what is the best way to restrict SSL VPN access to specific devices while avoiding the downsides of cert-based VPN? Are there any alternative methods or best practices that I should consider? 
 Any insights or recommendations would be appreciated.

                              <span>As I am a storage/vmware admin at my current role and our network team is looking into moving away from our current network setup. We are currently using Xtreme switches and core and moving on the Fabric. 
 While my SAN switches are now not routed over the core and are different from my TOR switches. My 4 SAN switches are running standalone, 2 in each datacenter connected to each other. 
 Now with Fabric incomming our network team want to use the same switch for TOR and SAN network both routed over the core, is this a good idea ? 
 Currently i&#x27;m running a test cluster with a vmware host connected to 2 frabric switches for TOR &amp; SAN and that traffic is running over our old core X8 back to our old SAN switch and our storage appliances. What I am seeing atm is there are only a few test VM&#x27;s running on that host, but the latency is high. I wonder if this setup is a good idea or if it&#x27;s better to keep SAN completaly seperated from the other traffic like it is in our current setup.

 It is to run a report on open ports for server security on a schedule.
 ​
 do you know of any alternatives for this, i would like to look around and see if there are other ways to get these reports.

                              <span>This just came up while configuring a new NAC deployment.
 Fairly common scenario that I&#x27;ve not thought through before. You have your relay agents (whatever they are) configured with a pair of dhcp servers to cover your ass. When the relay agent receives a request, does it forward to both, round robin, or some sort of stateful decision tree? Just finished reading rfc 1542 (best, most detailed description I could find) and I&#x27;m no better informed on the topic.
 At this point, I&#x27;d love to throw together a lab and experimentally check what a dozen different devices do, but have a few too many projects I&#x27;m behind on. Anybody already done this legwork?
 Whole question is because I stumbled upon instructions to setup the NAC mgmt port as an additional relay target and it will passively sniff for DHCP fingerprinting. Obviously clients get DHCP either way, just with more delays if there&#x27;s some form of load balancing. But RR would mean fingerprinting is inconsistent across devices.

                              <span>Fellow Networkers, 
 I’m looking for advice. Our 7K’s have many VRFs, SVI’s and PortChannels configured. What is the least impactful method on how to migrate VPC’s, L3 uplinks, and SVI’s? Our 7Ks are advertising with OSPF with a floating static route as a backup. We can’t afford downtime during the migration.

 I have my Bachelors and a CCIE:Routing and Switching and about 10 years of Network Engineering experience but I think my hold up for teaching at a university is that I do not have my masters degree. This is for jobs in the US.

                              <span>I used to love running cEOS in GNS3 because it gave me a Cisco-like CLI + MCLAG while also being more lightweight and less throughput constrained than Arista&#x27;s vEOS. 
 Recently I&#x27;ve moved to EVE-NG as my platform of choice, and it&#x27;s great, except I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to start a docker container with (1) startup commands and (2) environment variables, both of which are required to run a containerized EOS. The EVE-NG team has not given much support on this subject, so I here I am asking you fine folks for help.
 Has anyone here gotten cEOS and/or custom docker images to run in EVE-NG?
 EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted? If you do a search on the subject you&#x27;ll find that there is only ONE resource talking about how to run custom docker images on EVE-NG, but that is using docker-in-docker, which I want to avoid due to the performance tax. (The whole reason I&#x27;m using cEOS is to get better performance...). Plus the use-case for docker-in-docker is much more complex than starting a container with simple environmental variables.

                              <span>Hi!
 I installed an ER8411 VPN router in our office and I configured an IPsec VPN. My client device is a Windows 10 PC on another network. It connects to the VPN using TheGreenBow.
 I get good speeds, around 70 MB/s for file transfer, which is good for me.
 The problem I have is weird, and probably something I don&#x27;t know. When I try copying a file from any remote device to my local client, it will allocate the client&#x27;s ram for the size of that file. If I start a 5GB file copy, quickly the Ram usage will ramp up by 5GB. I need to transfer 60GB files, so that&#x27;s a big issue. Once the transfer is done, it DOES NOT free the ram...
 I do not have that problem if I launch a copy from another drive or a local NAS.
 Any idea or explaination?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 Was wondering if someone can provide an example of how to configure MEC on a Cisco C9500 that is configured in a StackWise Virtual Link, please? 
 For example: 
 In Arista, they use MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation). I know how to configure MLAG in the Arista using Port Channel and MLAG configuration. To do so, I select the interface, for example, interface ethernet 2, under that interface, then I create the “channel-group 20“ with the number and mode. Then I move to the interface “port-channel 20”, and associate that port channel with the mlag number (let’s say 20 as well). I&#x27;ll do the same on the second switch so both switches know they are part of an LACP/Port-Channel with MLAG connection in case switch one goes down. 
 Just need to know how I would configure MEC on the Cisco C9500 in a Stackwise Virtual mode.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am running into an issue at work that I am unable to figure out and I was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on to what might be happening.
 I have a device on my facility floor that is using a Static IP of:
 10.239.134.177
 255.255.255.0
 10.239.134.1
 The DNS servers are set correctly as well.
 When I run an ipconfig /all
 I get 2x IPv4 Addresses:
 10.239.134.177 (Preferred)
 255.255.255.0
 Then I also get a second IPv4 Address:
 10.255.255.241 (Preferred)
 255.0.0.0
 It is causing issues on my network because the second address seems to be taking priority.
 When I reboot the machine it only shows 1 address, but after about 15 mins the network icon in the taskbar gets a yellow triangle saying (no internet) and when you run the ipconfig /all you see the second IP has come back.
 The device does have 2 NIC&#x27;s but one of them is disabled and we are only using one.

 This is a link to the screenshot of the ipconfig.
 Thank you for any help you can provide.

                              <span>I have a JDSU NT800 that&#x27;s been very useful over the years, but unfortunately, one of the battery conductor plates inside the battery compartment got lost, and so it&#x27;s dead. I&#x27;ve done a few searches here, and also online, for a like replacement that comes in under $1000, and can&#x27;t seem to find anything... I need a unit that does: - RJ45 cable testing - Remote mapping - Cable length measurement - Link testing (PoE voltage, speed/duplex, polarity) - LLDP/CDP port ID - Ping testing with user-entered IP/gateway info
 It seems the NT800 is not sold any longer :( Any units out there that do the above at a sub-$1K price point?

                              <span>I encountered something funny today. In the far far dark corners of our network with gigabit switches cat 6 a whole domain and all the fun stuff, crammed in an old dusty panel was a Netgear EN104TP 10baseT hub sitting there serving a single computer, plc, and some industrial hardware. 
 I am by no means a network professional but this has me curious. Could a hub cause problems for the rest of a network if used at its extreme reach, or is it ok so long as it doesn&#x27;t cause problems among the devices it serves?

I&#x27;ve tried show mac address-table on each one and see nothing. At this point I&#x27;ve connected a laptop downstairs that&#x27;s on a continual ping so I know it has connectivity on the port, but I can&#x27;t find the mac address for that laptop. Catalyst switches, mix of models. Any help appreciated, as a ton of small children are due to arrive any moment and make this job a lot more difficult.
 Edit: Issue resolved. Thanks everyone who responded. I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the last you&#x27;ll see of me, hopefully next time with smarter questions than I had today.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a BGP routing solution for a multihoming site which would automatically do traffic engineering based on set of pre-configured rules. Specifically I&#x27;m looking on measuring latency and download/uploads speed of certain IPs, hosts and web urls, such as Amazon S3 buckets.
 I know that I can adjust manually things like local weights and preferences for outgoing traffic and to influence incoming traffic with AS route prefixing and announcing smaller prefixes to some of the transit peers, but I would want to automate this.
 Do anybody know any such product?

I started researching and listening to podcasts about it. It seems a lot of people see this as the future especially since 5g, and the cloud is becoming more and more relevant in our lives today. Just wanted to see if any network engineers or anyone who understands software defined networking had an opinions on this.

                              <span>Hi all, I help manage IT and infrastructure for a company based in the UK, and we&#x27;re soon looking to open an office in Los Angeles, and part of that process is installing a leased line/fibre connection (nothing huge, just 100Mbps) for a small office, but I don&#x27;t have the contacts/understanding of the process in the US that I do in the UK.
 Does anyone have any recommendations of a good local telecoms provider in LA that can help me get this sorted, and potentially provide some basic remote support for times when technical team members are not on-site?
 Thanks

 Can someone suggest what types of snmp trap Extreme AP410C can send, perhaps there is documentation on this topic somewhere.
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ve been working in an engineering team for a few years now (ISP). Mostly phasing out older stuff, helping out our SD teams and working on incidents that occurred. Also we&#x27;re occasionally involved with on-boarding new clients, fitting their needs. And other projects (think: new PoPs etc).
 Honestly, it kinda feels &#x27;stale&#x27;. I like to play new shiny stuff once in a while. play around with it, see if it fits our use. For example software/tooling for QoL, other hardware, else. 
 Reflecting on other engineering teams in other branches e.g. motorsports; they have engineers with a clear goal: win a race within certain rules. I don&#x27;t think we (as NWE&#x27;s) always have these clear rules. There is -however- one clear goal: it has to work. It mostly does not matter how (no clear rules).
 How would one create some kind of &#x27;race&#x27; to squeeze every bit from a router. Having no jitter, or making sure you lose no packets in transit? Otherwise, i don&#x27;t really feel being an engineer but more like a janitor.

                              <span>Are there any cheaper/smaller firewall appliances that can do greater than 1Gb to 10Gb firewall throughput that don&#x27;t have a lot of extra features. I don&#x27;t need more than 2x SFP+ ports, don&#x27;t need VPN capability. 
 I&#x27;ve tried looking at all the big names and they either have models that have all 1G ports or have ones that have way more 10G ports and features than I would need and can afford.
 The only options I&#x27;ve found so far is NetGate TNSR appliances, or Ubiquiti ER-8-XG-US.
 Edit: Cheaper would be &lt;$10k USD or around that target.

 I&#x27;m not sure how or why IT became the &quot;hey you know how to do computers so why don&#x27;t you fix the fridge on your downtime&quot; role but absolutely and with certainty fuck all of that noise. Stand up for yourselves and stop letting douchebags tell you how to perform, what to do and do things that aren&#x27;t in your job description. 
 It&#x27;s amazing how many people bend over backwards, skip lunch and drive themselves up a wall for selfish assholes who don&#x27;t give a single fuck about you or your mental wellbeing. Put your phone on DND, eat lunch and make people wait. Stop being a pushover pussy and you won&#x27;t have to come to reddit to vent and hate everyone every morning at 9AM. 
 Have some self respect and stop self loathing. Our jobs are difficult enough. You don&#x27;t need to hate your position because you don&#x27;t have enough self respect to stand up to people and tell them to fuck off very nicely.

                              <span>Obligatory sorry for grammar/punctuation as I am on mobile.
 I put up a post over a year ago complaining about policy and management at my job, you can view on my profile. TLDR of that post was management was changing policy flip flopping back and forth and making our jobs harder because of it.
 I spent a lot of time at the old place complaining, and wallowing in my self pity. Thinking that I wasnt good enough and that there was no way another company would hire me. I blamed management for my unhappiness which is partially true but in the end it was my fault for staying and letting them make me unhappy.
 On the flip side yesterday I had my 6 month review at my new job that went spectacular. I found a place that is supportive and listens to employees to improve the company. It&#x27;s not perfect by any means but no where really is. Since I&#x27;ve been here my mental health has improved, I&#x27;ve been eating better and I&#x27;ve lost ~60lbs. I&#x27;m learning more than ever and have the ability to move up in the company.
 Please remember that no job is worth your health. If you are not happy or your health, both physical or mental is declining, leaving is better than staying. Yes I&#x27;m aware that is easier said than done it took me almost 10 months to decide and actively look for another job but it worked out in the end.

                              <span>We’re a smaller team, our manager left last year and someone was brought in but ultimately didn’t work out.
 This time I put my name in the hat as did another coworker (he applied the first time as well but was passed up.)
 I met with our CTO today and was told that the organization was going with the coworker over me, essentially because of seniority even though I’d be a better fit.
 This is a guy who
  
Calls people on their days off because he’s too lazy to spend five minutes looking for an answer
 Has to be told/shown multiple times to do something (I’m starting to wonder if he can read and write)
 Does nothing to improve things and does not work smart
 Won’t take ownership of stuff and will try anything to push work off to others or weasel out of it
 Staff outside our main office specifically complain about him
  
What’s worse is I was given permission from our other coworkers on the team to use as a reference as well as a respected manager outside our group. I don’t believe he had any. While I haven’t seen his resume, I don’t believe he’s the better qualified candidate (other than being in IT longer.)
 The boss says the decision was not his and leadership/hr overruled him.
 I may give it a few months to see how things pan out but I’ll likely leave if I can find an employer who’ll match or beat my benefits.

You ask them - let me remind you they work on &#x27;system x&#x27; eight hours or more a day - and they can&#x27;t tell you what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and what it isn&#x27;t doing that makes it &#x27;broken&#x27;. How is that remotely possible.

                              <span>Curious about what all ya&#x27;ll out there use for documentation. I went through data servers at my company and gathered many years of old and new documents, how-to&#x27;s, and guides which are now just sitting in SharePoint and nobody really wants to use it.
 It seems like a waste of time having to answer IT questions through Teams chat when we can just find the answers quickly ourselves ya? Currently stuck with a minimal helpdesk system without any of these kinds of features.

 This malware can bypass all boot protection on any Windows Box but it needs to run as admin to do so.
 Once a devices is infected it is really hard to remove. The malware infects the bootloader and runs in kernel land.

 I think for me I would be very skeptical but assuming &quot;it&quot; could do everything I needed and worked out more efficient, then I&#x27;d be very interested.
 I&#x27;d be especially interested in what people think a no-code solution wouldn&#x27;t be able to do...

                              <span>Hi all. Just started working remotely for a sensitive financial institution. They provided me a laptop and said I cannot use any of my home monitors to attach to it as it’s a security risk. I never heard of this before. Any truth to this? Anyone aware of what the risk might be? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>It&#x27;s 2:58 pm, I haven&#x27;t had a break.. 
 The phone keeps ringing off the hook, and my half eaten Wendy&#x27;s cheeseburger sits hardening on my desk. 
 I am paid 1/4 of what the people I&#x27;m helping are making, yet I am expected to know the inner workings of every software or complicated piece of equipment that they rely on.
 Ironically it is them who are allowed to slack off and complain to no end when something doesn&#x27;t go their way.
 Every day there is another self important asshole who thinks their job is more important than everyone else&#x27;s.
 Ironically, it is these same &quot;overworked&quot; and &quot;stressed out&quot; individuals whom I see heading to the cafeteria 10+ times a day, when I haven&#x27;t finished my lunch in a week.
 I am only one man to 600 tech inept employees. 
 My question is, why is there no computer competency test for positions that are paying $100k + a year?? What is this absolute bullshit.
 Would you hire a carpenter who doesn&#x27;t know how to hold a hammer?
 It&#x27;s twenty twenty fucking 3 is it not?
 Rant over.

                              <span>Starting yesterday, most (dozens) of my Windows Server (2016 /2019/2022) have been failing to apply Defender definition updates. In the Defender event logs, I get this:
 Microsoft Defender Antivirus has encountered an error trying to update security intelligence. New security intelligence Version: 1.383.1379.0 Previous security intelligence Version: Update Source: User Security intelligence Type: AntiSpyware Update Type: Full User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Current Engine Version: 1.1.20000.2 Previous Engine Version: Error code: 0x80508007 Error description: Your device is low on memory. Close some programs and try again, or search Help and Support for information about preventing low memory problems. 
 Tried numerous ways to get them to install (MPCMDRUN commands, downloading the direct installer from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates, etc.). Always ends up with the same 80508007. None of these servers (mix of physical and VM) are low on memory or any other resources. The last successful update version was 1.383.1289.0 (from 3/8/2023).
 Is anyone else seeing any issues like this?

 For context remote users use SonicWall VPN and my experience is the fastest fix is a simple reboot. Emailed instructions; will send texts if asked; I will even take a phone call and politely explain to reboot. &quot;Hey just reboot and your issue will be solved. This thing just hangs up from time to time.&quot;
 After a few minutes The number of times I hear the words &quot;Did that; same error&quot; only to find their uptime being over a day is increasingly annoying. 
 This feels new and I think people are getting dumber and lazier. Been in IT 20+ years and I thought we&#x27;d be passed this.
 For those young sysadmins feeling like you wont be needed in 20 years because people will know technology. I can safely say YOU&#x27;RE SAFE!

                              <span>Wondered if you fine redditors could help a guy out....
 No idea if other countries do this but in the UK its common for kids (age 15-17) before they go to college to do a week or two of &#x27;work experience&#x27; .
 Anyway, this kid is coming here as he wants to get into IT and/or Dev so he&#x27;s spending 2 days with our software engineers, 2 days with our test equipment design team (we&#x27;re a manufacturing facility) and he&#x27;s with me for one day on Monday. He gets to rate the experience so naturally there is some friendly competition amongst us as to which was more interesting, and I only get one day.
 ​
 What the hell do I trust a 16 year old child with that:
 - is engaging and not intensely boring
 - shows a good overview of what working in an &#x27;IT&#x27; support/ops environment is like
 - can be explained quickly as time is limited
 - doesn&#x27;t involve giving him the keys to the kingdom or other such compliance nightmares
 - doesn&#x27;t involve me talking at him for 8 hours.
 - can be done in production because I&#x27;m not in tomorrow, only found out about this on Monday and haven&#x27;t had time to set up any kind of lab he can happily break

                              <span>How does Palo Alto compare against Fortinet in regards to their code quality?
 ​
 I have a lot of experience with Fortinet, and their quality flat out sucks. Apply a fix... break another thing. Apply a fix to that... break another thing... and so on.... Oh.. and &quot;we didn&#x27;t fix the issue in this major version line.. upgrade to the next major version to get the fix.&quot; Seems like it has gotten worse over the last year or two, to be honest.
 ​
 Looking for opinions from folks who have experience with both vendors.

 Is there any way to bypass this? We do not want to connect these printers to the Interent as they are USB connected devices.

                              <span>We are setting up a new HP server using RAID 1 for x2 OS drives and RAID 10 for x8 Data Drives.
 As it stands the OS drives are in slots 1 and 2, with the rest being allocated to data.
 When I go to create the Logical Drives using Intelligent Provisioning, I can see that, there are 4 drives allocated to Port 1 on the RAID controller, 4 drives allocated to Port 2 on the RAID controller, and 2 drives connected to Port 3 on the RAID controller.
 The issue is that the x2 OS drives are intermixed with the x8 drives and not separated under port 3 for the expansion bay. Does it matter which drives are connected to which ports on the RAID controller? Or should I just be able to cut up into logical drives no matter where the drives are plugged in?
 Edit: and also from a sysadmin perspective, what would be the least confusing configuration for this setup. To have the OS drives in bays 1 and 2, or have them in the last slots 9 and 10 and be in the expansion bay.

 We are 3 people rotating on-call during weekends.
 User 1 - Week 1
 User 2 - Week 2
 User 3 - Week 3
 User 1- Week 4
 etc. 
 But i can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to add on-call that&#x27;s reoccurring every n weeks for each user.
 As it is now i have to update the schedule every 3 weeks, since i can only figure out how to add on-call for one specific weekend by adding it with dates.
 See the picture here for how i&#x27;ve done it so far.
 Thanks!

The usual steps to fix it seem to be working, but I need to find out what&#x27;s causing it all of a sudden. It seems to be different people at different times over the last 2 weeks. Is there any way to find out what might be causing this error? When it happens they can&#x27;t sign into any office or outlook apps and clearing credential manager seems to fix it. But our queue is getting filled with new users having this problem all of sudden and it&#x27;s taking up time to fix each user.

 Do you use some tool, software, or anything to have all your notifications from each different app, in just one place, one control panel? (Desktop) (Like a mail client, but for all apps like whatsapp, messenger, discord, reddit, email, github, etc etc..)

                              <span>We have a ticket system which is customer facing. Recently customers have started adding read receipts to their emails. Our ticket system is logging in to our 365 account, downloading the messages and then deleting them which is flagging them as &quot;Deleted and not read&quot;. This sends our customers an email saying &quot;this email was deleted and not read&quot;. 
 Is there a way to stop this? We have disabled &quot;Read Receipts&quot; in outlook web, but the emails still happen. Apparently &quot;Read Receipts&quot; are not the same as &quot;Not Read Receipts&quot;.

 We have a Sharp BP-70C45
 ​
 And Odd thing is happening. We have MS365
 I have setup scan to email with smtp auth(Option1)
 I cannot use Direct Send(Option2) as it need to go to external recipeints as well
 I cannot use SMTP Relay(Option3) as it is a dynamic IP, I tried but it fails/does not work, even if I put the dynip on the sfp and connector
 ​
 So what is happening is I cannot scan to email to multiple recipients in my domain
 ie ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com)) it gives me a time out error on the printer
 ​
 I can send to a single recipient in my domain ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 I can send to multiple external recipients to any external domain([userext1@ext1.com](mailto:userext1@ext1.com), [user2@extother2.com](mailto:user2@extother2.com))
 ​
 But if I try to send to multiple users in my domain ie([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com))
 it will give me a timeout error on the printer 
 OR 
 If I try to send to a mix of external([user1@somedomain.com](mailto:user1@somedomain.com)) and internal([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 It will send to the external but will give a timeout error for the internal. 
 ​
 So not sure if its something with the printer or MS365, anyone seen something like this before

                              <span>Hey All,
 Just looking for some advice. I have been looking at creating an internal Ansible infrastructure from scratch for our small team. The master server setup and inventory is quite easy and the box is easily screwed down re: the security as far as OS and access for certain groups, correct access rights, logging, locked down firewalls as well. You know, the sane usual settings.
 One thing that really worries me is the fact that in order to use the Ansible setup properly we are going to have to create keys that have no password, are exempted from 2FA rules and can switch to root level access. 
 The information on these servers &quot;is the business&quot; so if our data got lost it would be the end of the business if that makes sense. If the box got compromised it would be game over.
 In order to get the key they would have to exploit some creds to get into the box but its the sheer lateral movement/access that is gotten if these keys are misappropriated that worries me.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hey guys!
 ​
 This whole Exchange Online / Hybrid-Configuration topic has been bugging me for a long time now. I hope someone might be able to help me.
 ​
 Following scenario: We have a Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online and an on-prem Active Directory (NO AD Connect). So at the moment we always have to create two users: one for the M365 tenant / Exchange Online and one user for the on-prem AD.
 ​
 Is it possible to merge the on-prem AD users with the M365 users? I did find some tutorials on how to configure Azure AD Connect using soft and hard matching. BUT: I also read on some forum, that you must have an on-prem exchange in order for it to work properly (no further information was given). This on-prem Exchange is just used for communication between Exchange Online and the on-prem environment (no mailboxes etc. needed). How do I have to configure that on-prem Exchange? Just install it, configure hybrid mode and start creating users withing on-prem Exchange? Do I have to license the on-prem Exchange?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Just wanted to give a headsup about this issue. We got two brand new Lenovo SR630 V2 servers with Broadcom 57414 NICs. Installed Lenovo ESXi 7.0.3 image from Lenovo site, see that the 1gb NICs show up in VmWare but 10gb nics 57414 don&#x27;t show up. Troubleshooted half a day, installed latest firmware but nothing. Device itself is visible in esxi cli but not when calling esxcli nic command.
 Finally found theres an issue about it: https://datacentersupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/servers/thinksystem/sr630v2/7z71/solutions/tt1001-broadcom-57454-ocp-and-57414-ocp-nics-do-not-appear-in-uefi-after-flashing-fw-to-222173
 Downgrading the firmware back to 219.0.29.0 and then the nics showed up in VmWare
 Quite a big problem if server is unusable out of box and promised fix is coming by the end on April.

 I don&#x27;t know if the community of r/sysadmin might help with my issue, see it as a message in a bottle and mods feel free to delete if it doesn&#x27;t fit this sub requirements! 
 I&#x27;m having huge trouble with a OOM issue when running MariaDB :
 - Server specs : https://pastebin.com/qXCbBWLM
 - InnoDB Status : https://pastebin.com/p9aNVWqT
 - MySQLTuner report: https://pastebin.com/xfvVt1Nv
 The main issue is that even though MariaDB is allocated 20Gb for &#x27;innodb_buffer_pool_size&#x27;, it goes way up in memory consumption leading to this graph :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5hxodSj)
 As we can see in this graph, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to an activity spike :

 And if we take a look at the buffer size (the issue started when the &#x27;lowered&#x27; was 1Gb so we went for 24Gb and lowered it to 20Gb) :

 I already tried to tweak some MariaDB configurations but struggle to find the culprit of this OOM issue. There is only MariaDB running on this server and the kernel log file shows me that only MariaDB is consuming RAM when the OOM occurs.
 Is this only an issue of too low RAM to run this database ?
 Any help is welcome and if I can provide any other information just ask, I&#x27;m getting reallllyyyy desperate ! Thank you for your reading and have a good day !

 I know that the client resolver on W10 switches to the second DNS server after trying and failing with the first server for 1 second. But when does it switch back? I know it does after a restart, but what about during regular operation? From my findings, Windows doesn&#x27;t &quot;balance&quot; between servers. It sticks with the first one until the 1 second timeout.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have an on Prem AD server which sync&#x27;s out users to AAD using Azure AD Connect.
 Recently the On Prem AD server went pop which obviously has stopped the sync. My plan over the course of the next month was to Fully migrate away from the on Prem server anyway as there is no need for it any more. All of our Microsoft services are cloud based. We have no on site applications. All machines are connected via Azure and linked up to intune. So really all we use the on Prem server for is creating accounts. 
 My question is... What would the implications be of just leaving the server in its current state seeing as though I was going to be getting rid of it anyway. Do the current users get converted to Cloud users automatically 
 ...or is it advisable to restore from backups and carry out the steps of stopping syncs at both ends etc.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 Im currently trying to add servers of differents domains in the server manager.
 I&#x27;ve added them by ip, then I&#x27;ve used the &quot;Manage As&quot; button to specify domain information.
 Eveything is working fine and all the informations about the server display (services, logs etc).
 But when I close the server manager and reopen it, the informations are gone and I have to click on &quot;Manage As&quot; on each server, to specify domain information again.
 Is there a way for the domain information to stay veen when i restart the server manager ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been working as a sysadmin for a couple of years now and I work at a company that has 500+ people working, not a small company, not a huge either.
 Our CIO left the company and the process to find a new one just finished and they landed with a CIO with 20+ years of experience in the field, after a few talks with the new CIO and he seems to have a lot of knowledge.
 My only issue is that he decided to change our entire OS infrastructure, from Windows to ChromeOS. I&#x27;ve asked him why the change, he said &quot;ChromeOS is more secure and faster&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve never used ChromeOS, so I don&#x27;t know what to expect on it. 
 I&#x27;m half tempted to learn the OS to improve my skills and knowledge, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t wanna waste time learning something that I might not use much in the future if I change jobs or he leaves (the previous company where he worked started the transition back to windows after he left, the employees weren&#x27;t happy with ChromeOS). 
 What do you guys think on this transition and what would you do in my shoes?

                              <span>We currently use Portnox as a VPN but it is awful so we are looking for a solution elsewhere, any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
 We have a remote desktop but one piece of software is not compatible with it (I know ... why did they buy it.. )
 Portnox also authenticates users to connect too the on-site WiFi, if this solution could also authenticate end users to use on site WiFi that would be a plus!

                              <span>Hi everyone, this will be a long post, so bear with me.
 The issue started a couple of years ago, where an employee bought an Surface Book 2 with Win 10 Pro, x64 for daily work. Everything went smoothly at the beginning. The user could access the on premise file shares and work with all the company files, also the transition from the company network to the internet and access via VPN and so on, almost everything was running fine.
 The only exception was one particular vm Win Server 2019 on which a CRM was running and presenting a smb share to the users, from which they could start the applications. This software is designed, that everything can run directly from the server, you only have to have access to the network share and start the application.
 And with this Surface device, the issue…</span>

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 I need to run a script, when a user does disconnect and reconnect to his/her RDP session on Windows 2022.
 ​
 What I tried is, to do this with a task manager job:
 If there is a new event 25 in Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational
 --&gt; Extract the &quot;User&quot; variable and start a script
 ​
  Event/UserData/EventXML[@Name&#x3D;&quot;User&quot;]  
 and then:
 -File C:\Batch\test.ps1 -TargetUsername &quot;$(User)&quot; 
 ...but the variable is always empty.
 I also tried &quot;%username%&quot; but this one is always filled with one special user (I do not know, why) and not with the &quot;reconnecting&quot; user.
 ​
 Can you give me a hint on how to solve this?
 ​
 Thank you and best wishes

                              <span>Good morning,
 a quick question... currently we are thiking to use the Lansweeper agent to retrieve the system configuration of various PC outside the domain.
 We have already an inventory and I am able to format that inventory according to the Lansweeper import format.
 I haven&#x27;t yet tested it but according to the search I did, I will not able to sync the item on the inventory with the information retrieved by the agent deployed on the same PC.
 Am I in the right?
 Is it avaiable if so any workaround?

 Thank you!

 I am not sure if this is the right sub but let me try. I work in accounting (EU) and every month i have to send 3-4 seperate files to 120+ different clients. The files are always saved in a folder named 01_jan, 02_feb ect. The content of the mail is always the same for every customer except the name. Is there any program out there that can automate this or even just a par of it? Do you have recomendations?
 Best Regards.

                              <span>I am dealing with a fairly large Nutanix infrastructure 40+ nodes across several clusters and locations. We use it like you you would use a vmware or any other hypervisor to just run VMs. Nothing special no fancy services or scripting. 
 When I say every single upgrade I have done has failed or taken 8+ hours for something that should be 2 at the most, I mean every single upgrade. I can&#x27;t find a single redeeming quality to this system. Every issue requires SSH access to the controller VMs, and either a pile of CLI or direct intervention from their support staff. In a 10+ year career I&#x27;ve never talked to support so much in such a short amount of time. Every firmware upgrade of the underlying host turns into a multi hour nightmare with crazy 2+ hour timeouts before a failure message. Every single feature down to what should be the simplest thing is manual, or a ratking of python scripts behind a sleek UI with bad progress reporting. Something as easy as upgrading the VM guest tools is a manual process with no automation. 
 I don&#x27;t understand, what&#x27;s the value add? How is this company maintaining customers?

But I want to think outside the box a bit; can we put some more safeguards on exactly who can encrypt data? Can we wholesale disallow via GPO the use of encryption on the OS? Can the OS/Admin have a system-wide &quot;skeleton key&quot; that can decrypt data regardless of encryption keys used? It can&#x27;t just be about backups and malware prevention, cybersecurity needs to neutralize the threat itself, to de-fang encryption-abuse. Is anybody in cybersecurity thinking along these lines?

                              <span>Preface: Inherited setup
 We are a smallish organisation with 20 sites + 1 Datacenter headend all on MPLS. We currently have all the backup IPSec tunnels terminating on the core router (network core and MPLS headend) in the DC but I am looking to move the tunnels to a new/repurposed router to avoid SPOF.
 We have onprem (Datacenter) domain controllers and Office365/Azure AD in a hybrid setup.
 Hardware:
 Core router - Juniper SRX4600 in HA
 Repurposed Router - Juniper SRX1500 in HA
 The SRX4600 is beastly enough to handle the existing and future tunnels but I am just looking at a cleaner way to tie everything in. FYI - We are in locked in for a further 3 years with our MPLS provider.
 What is everyone doing nowadays with backup tunnels (besides ditching MPLS altogether for SDWAN and SASE/CASB :))

                              <span>A question for the ios-xr users out there - 
 cut over to a new firewall and moved the L3 interfaces from the router to the firewall behind a transit vlan 
 Prior to the cutover the interfaces were all being advertised out on bgp using network statement and route policy. Upon moving the interface to the firewall it appears that the router is no longer advertising those subnets into the BGP peering. Why could this be?
 Changes made: Transit subnet/interfaces created on router Static routes added to point routers to new location of the subnets Old interfaces deleted
 Troubleshooting: Pings to otherside of transit interface - pass Routes in local table - pass Advertised routes - fail 
 Please ask away If you need more info

                              <span>Long time lurker and first time poster. Thought I would cross post this from the K12 page just to see what insight you all could provide too.
 Looking into new wireless hardware for this next fall for my district. I feel like reviews are all over the place... I&#x27;m hoping maybe you all can share your experience and advice on what has worked best for your district.
 We are a small district. Two buildings with 1200 students and 200 staff. Our environment is somewhat mixed. Students are 1to1 iPad, staff are 1to1 Mac Air, Chromebooks for assistants, and office staff have windows desktops.
 We are currently running 3 year old Aruba switches and 2 year old Unifi AC HD AP&#x27;s. While I really haven&#x27;t had many issues with the AP&#x27;s, used Unifi in other districts and businesses for the last 8 years, I&#x27;m concerned UBNT may not be as focused as they use to be on the networking end.
 I&#x27;m considering staying with Unifi and purchasing U6 Enterprise AP&#x27;s. Testing with them so far has gone well in classroom.
 But, I&#x27;ve also been considering Ruckus, Extreme or maybe Aruba based on bids I&#x27;ve received (I don&#x27;t have any experience with any of those 3) I have had Meraki and I&#x27;m not a fan of the Meraki licensing model or hardware.
 Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I am looking for at least 4 cassettes in 1U. 4 is fine.
 I could do FS but rather not. I&#x27;m looking at LanShack as they have it in stock and can get me 2 panels with 2 cassettes each quick enough.
 I normally use Panduit Opticom units (FMD1/2) with their cassettes. It&#x27;s about ten times the price almost compared to LanShack. Panduit stock is really slim at the moment anywhere I look. 
 Never used LanShack before. Anyone used their cassettes? Are they reliable?

                              <span>I would appreciate any help. The problem is that every time I connect via AnyConnect to xxx.com (for example) it pops up a window for me to validate the VPN downloader plugin. Is there any way I can disable this? Is this an inherent part of connecting to Remote VPN? Interestingly, the VPN downloader is only initiated if I connect to xxx.com. On the other hand, if I connect to yyy.com, the window to accept the VPN downloader does not pop up for me.

                              <span>We have been experiencing a strange DHCP issue the last few days. We are using Juniper Ex4300s as an L3 gateway, with UniFi access switching and wireless.
 Clients will send DHCP Discover to the router, which is then relayed to a Windows DHCP server. The server then sends an Offer, which is received by the client.
 This is where we run into issues. The client sends a DHCP Request, but the request never makes it to the Juniper gateway. This is mostly affecting our WiFi, so I am thinking it is the UniFi APs, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a resolution to this issue.
 DHCP Snooping is disabled. We have tested several different firmware versions on the APs, to no avail.
 EDIT: This is affecting wired clients as well.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve got a client with a Catalyst 3850 stack, running on some old ass code 3.6.3. (bad i know, they arent even under support by cisco either)
 ​
 The issue they&#x27;re having is ONLY the primary/master switch in the stack is functioning. All 3 other switches&#x27; interfaces aren&#x27;t working. All commands show the stack is functioning as normal however...
 &#x27;show switch&#x27; shows all switches are a part of the stack no problem.
 &#x27; show switch stack-ports&#x27; shows all is good with the stack cables
 Nothing in the logs is showing anything out of the ordinary, except for %SPI_FC-3-HIGH_WMARK_REACHED: Number of messages in the queue for channel 11 has reached maximum. Which i&#x27;m reading is a known bug on this code... shouldn&#x27;t be an issue with stacking.
 We&#x27;re able to reload all other switches individually with &#x27;reload slot x&#x27; command, and reloading all other switches (except for the primary, because we dont want to reload the working one during business hours) didn&#x27;t seems to fix it. After reloading the other member switches, they join back into the stack just fine. 
 ​
 The member switches&#x27; ports are simply just not coming up. It&#x27;s showing no link activity like there&#x27;s no cable even plugged in. Tried bouncing the ports, and unplugging/replugging in cables, no luck.
 ​
 Has anyone ever ran into this? The plan is to reboot the whole stack tonight after work hours to see if that fixes, which i&#x27;m hoping it does. It has an uptime of 2 years also.
 Any advice would be appreciated!!
 EDIT:: The reboot fixed it! Of course next step is to get them upgraded. Thanks for the responses.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We&#x27;ve had Cisco routers on order for over a year now and their ETA keeps getting pushed further out. I am wondering how prevalent different virtual router products such as VyOS, TNSR, or even CSR1K/CSR8K are in the enterprise non cloud environment for replacing traditional ethernet routers used for internet edge and private WAN connectivity. I understand there are some (very) large and small businesses that make use of them, but would like to understand how &quot;ready&quot; are they to replace traditional hardware-based internet/WAN routers? Most discussions around VyOS tend to be around home use rather than enterprise and VyOS/TNSR seem to be only occasionally mentioned in enterprise networking related discussions.
 Also, does anyone have experience with technical support for either? VyOS looks to be &lt; $20K per year for unlimited installs and 1-4Hr support SLA. I feel I&#x27;d have a better time convincing management to try a products other than Cisco if they can be assured that they have decent support. There also aren&#x27;t many concrete performance numbers published for VyOS but anecdotal evidence suggests that 10Gbps+ should be achievable even when hosted on ESXi. Are there any &quot;gotchas&quot; to look forward to with hosting any of these on ESXi as far as functionality, stability, and performance?
 Thank you all for taking the time to read this.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m suffering with speed client speed issues with one of our stacks of Dell5548 switches (5 members).
 This presents as speed tests (iperf to a server, another client on the same stack or to WAN) performing at 0Mbps-990Mbps (speed fluctuates massively per second per client).
 We have 2 10Gbps fibre uplinks from our core in a port-channel, I&#x27;ve tried shutting each of these in turn to see if its a link issue but obviously the issue persists on the stack itself so I don&#x27;t think its a link issue.
 The switches are stacked in &quot;Ring&quot; (port 1 on switch 1 to port 2 on switch 2, down to switch 5 where port 1 goes back to port 2 switch 1).
 I&#x27;ve tried enabling BDPUGuard on all non-trunk ports to no avail. Our core stack is our root bridge for RSTP. I&#x27;ve added (and then removed) portfast fro…</span>

We have a number of legacy industrial printers that do not support Wifi, but the area they&#x27;re in has no drops (additional drops aren&#x27;t an option).
 From my understanding I can configure H303 or H500 AP&#x27;s to join the wireless, then allow access via their built-in Ethernet ports. I&#x27;ve been googling around but am not finding much; can anyone point me in the right direction?

                              <span>We use cheap switches in our offices to break out many VLANs to different equipment, laptops, desktops, printers. We were using Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch 8s very successfully, but they are out of stock.
 We&#x27;re trying FS.com switches to fill this role (I also looked into Juniper, but their 8 port switches are still stupid expensive for this use) and they read like they have all the features and more than we&#x27;d need, at a very low price.
 Ok, so I&#x27;ve got the FS2800 series 8 port switch with 2 fiber uplinks. The CLI is reasonable and accessible via serial. I can define VLANs and trunking etc. All good.
 However, when plugged into our distribution switches on a tagged port, I cannot ping or ssh to the configured interface.
 Their documentation (as expected) isn&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;m just wondering if I&#x27;m …</span>

                              <span>We are in the process of combining multiple tenants one one physical network in an office location. Looking at dynamic VLANs as an option to simplify the networking setup. 
 Each org will have “private” resources (i.e. NAS) and also share a few “public” resources (i.e., printers). 
 First question — it’s a fairly small office. In total we’ll have less than 20 dynamic clients and we’re currently using a Meraki device. What hardware will I need to accomplish this? 
 Second — for shared resources (i.e., printers) what’s the easiest way to have a device span multiple vlans in this way?
 Anything other questions I should be asking?

                              <span>My boss recently has come across some access switches (3750x and 9200) that he noticed some differences across the configs. What is the best way to take a golden config and push out something that ensures all other switches have exactly the same config as the golden switch?
 We have Cisco Prime, not sure if that has a feature to do this. But I am also somewhat comfortable with python and ansible. I know with ansible, I have done ansible diff to find differences, just not sure how to go about enforcing changes based off that.
 Just trying to find an easier way than wiping all the switches and putting a new config on them.
 Thanks

 I have a ruijie smart switch. I have 3 internet connection. I wanna add this connections to vlan1 with a server. Server will connect this wan connections with virtual ip. Clients are connect to server as gateway but clients are in different vlan. They can&#x27;t access to server. How should i make vlan settings. 
 Server has one cable for connect to switch. For short I wanna create two vlans and one device can access both vlans.

                              <span>One of the employees there that I worked with messages me out of the blue today asking me to please call a payment merchant and to remove my name and add his name to the account. In my head I can&#x27;t believe 4 years later the merchant account is still under my name, but this was a small mom/pop 14 employee kind of place.
 back story I created a payment website for an association and used a local merchant for the online payment processing portion.
 I have an email drafted and ready to go to his boss but what would ya&#x27;ll do? Should I just reply to him and tell him I can&#x27;t do this or is it better that his boss knows he&#x27;s trying to get me to pretend I still work at the company by calling the merchant and letting them know to increase the limit of the online payment processor. Either way this blew my mind...

 imo the simpler the better. The problem with Manage is it&#x27;s so bloated with features I would never use, and I cannot use even if I wanted to because the permissions are completely jacked in our environment.

 This avoids dealing with SMTP, or Outlook COM automation, and will work with whatever email client is installed.
 PowerShell version:
 Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web #create to, subject, body $EmailURL &#x3D; &quot;mailto:someone@example.com?subject&#x3D;test-subject&amp;body&#x3D;Hello world!&quot; #URL encode it $EmailURL &#x3D; [System.Web.HttpUtility]::UrlEncode($EmailURL) #URL will now look like this %22mailto%3Asomeone%40example.com%3Fsubject%3Dtest-subject%26body%3DHello%20world!%22 Start-Process $EmailURL 
 To make body formatting easier you can do something like this:
 $body &#x3D; @&quot; Hi, This mail is a reminder. Please confirm ASAP. Thanks &quot;@ 
 VBA version:

 My situation
 Worked my way through the standard sysadmin role to now being more of an IT (project) management role.
 I work in an international organization with IT colleagues spread in lots of countries.
 I am working from HQ but mostly my role is supporting/managing local IT colleagues and to make their life easier.
 These local IT colleagues purchase hardware based on HQ recommendations mostly, albeit these are often not hard recommendations - in areas like accessories (keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.) there is a lot of flexibility on purchasing whatever fits the local organization best, although there are selected recommendations in some areas.
  
 We want to provide all IT colleagues with a repository of recommended hardware in all general categories.
 What would be the best way to go about doing that?
 Ideally it should:
 * Cover basic information for all relevant device models divided in categories (mouse, keyboard, etc.)
 * Provide reviews/insights from other local IT colleagues (e.g. 5-star rating, comments/reviews)
 * Include links to our recommended resellers for purchase
  
 We do have confluence and SharePoint available as tools.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience with SharePoint myself and I do know that confluence will struggle once you work with lots of information on a single page (especially tables) - which is bound to happen after some time of adding hardware to the list.
 Neither of these options (at least as far as I can tell) would provide an easy way of achieving the goal.
 We also have ServiceNow but I don&#x27;t think this use-case fits an ITSM solution.  
  
 Did any of you do something similar already?
 If yes, how did you do it?
  
 I appreciate any input you could share with me! :)

                              <span>Good morning!
 We have a Ricoh MFP that&#x27;s used to do the normal office stuff. Due to a move an a migration we had to change some back end accounts and now we can&#x27;t get the Scan to Email to work with Microsoft.
 It&#x27;s very puzzling. We have for sure narrowed it down to a Microsoft issue but it&#x27;s not an OU thing, it&#x27;s not MFA (it&#x27;s off for this account) we have the correct username and password and yet it&#x27;s still failing.
 Any troubleshooting ideas would be very welcome.

                              <span>Hey everyone. I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has seen this. 
 My company has a sever in each site for file share (among other things). The share structure is the same for each center, so are the permissions. I wrote a powershell script to build the share and add permissions. It works fine, the file structure is right, looking at the permissions, they look fine. 
 But the user don&#x27;t actually have permissions. They should, but when they try they get a permissions access denied. Doing the permissions manually it works fine. 
 Anyone have any idea why powershell permissions fail, but by hand does not?

                              <span>Good morning everyone. Can you give me some recommendations of software that can be used to automatically keep our network inventory up to date. It would need to be able to inventory servers (both Windows and Linux), switches (HP/Aruba), access points (Aruba), firewalls (Palo Alto), printers, and maybe a few other device types. This solution would need to be able to scan multiple subnets, and preferably filter out just the device types mentioned (for instance, I don&#x27;t need this tool to inventory desktops/laptops).
 As a bonus, does anyone know of any software that could scan web servers and keep an inventory of all websites hosted on those servers (we are a state agency, and host a LOT of websites)? This can be a separate solution from the above recommendations.
 Thanks for the help!

This morning a large number of our users get blank boxes when prompted for MFA when opening an app, and when I try accessing the azure ad I get an error, and half the menu links are grayed out. Says we&#x27;ve never ran AD sync either. Very odd.
 I&#x27;m in northern Indiana, close to the Chicago area, FYI.

                              <span>I realize I’m preaching to the choir in a sense, but about once a week a director will come into the IT office for us to help him set up a Zoom meeting. It’s not that hard and doesn’t take a lot of time but it’s frustrating that he’s done this for weeks in a row and refuses to try to do it himself.
 I’ve walked him through it 5 times and he still has no idea how to even start. I suggested an aptitude test to my coworkers and they agreed, but one wasn’t put in place.
 What do you guys think? Should there be an aptitude test for management positions?

                              <span>I just graduated college a few months ago with an information systems type degree. I have an over hour long commute 1 way to work. Pay is good. I started full time a few months after graduation as a Sys Admin 1. I am terrified. I feel like I don&#x27;t know anything and ask too many questions to my team of less than 10 supporting almost 1000 with all sorts of MS365 and AD and SCCM things which I never heard about in school. I dont feel like I belong. There is so much I don&#x27;t know. I love PCs and I love hardware an I get along with most of the users and they like me. I just feel like I don&#x27;t belong. I am the youngest by about 10 years on my team with everyone being there for a long time and being pretty close. They have got me working with vulnerability management and it&#x27;s interesting but I feel like I don&#x27;t know enough to do much. I can look at the CVEs and find the KBs online but I don&#x27;t know where to go from there. I just feel like I am in way over my head. I don&#x27;t feel like I know enough or can do enough to really do much. I dont know what to do. I don&#x27;t even know if this post is appropriate but I don&#x27;t know anyone else who understands and I don&#x27;t want to talk to anyone at work about it. I feel like it would only lead to bad things if I went to a coworker and was like &quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing and I am extremely nervous about my job. I just want to do well.&quot; There really hasn&#x27;t been any training mainly just 5 minute crash courses do this do that click this. Then left to my own. I am absolutely terrified of fucking this up. I got such a good job with amazing pay and benefits out the gate and I feel like I don&#x27;t fit. Thanks for reading.

 Does anyone have any experience with docking stations that work? I&#x27;m going crazy trying to find a proper docking station that works reliably.. 
 I&#x27;ve tried so many different devices, all kinds of Lenovo to Iiglo to belkin. I just purchased a Lenovo 32&quot; monitor with built in docking and it works great, but it doesn&#x27;t have an ethernet port or any display output for daisy chaining several screens which is a big minus.

 First i set up the connection to 1 NFS-Share which worked fine after some tweaking. A part of this journey was to create 2 keys in
 HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default
 The keys are &quot;AnonymousUID&quot; and &quot;AnonymousGID&quot;.
 Now the Problem is that with a different NFS-Share i will have different GID&#x27;s, but regedit doesnt allow a second key with the same name.
 How i can i make this work with 2 different GID-values?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to connect 4 different iscsi targets provided by a NAS with powershell. I don&#x27;t want to connect them all at once but rather separately, one at a time (first target1, then target2 and so on).
 So far I&#x27;ve had success geting the target names with get-iscsitarget and piping this to a select-string which then chooses the target I want to connect (target1 for the first target). I then pipe that to connect-iscsitarget but here&#x27;s my problem: This will assign the first available driveletter to the target. I want to assign specific letters, for example target1 gets W:, target2 gets X: and so on).
 But I cannot for the life of me find the command needed for this. All I can find is how to get driveletters from already connected targets and similat stuff.
 Any ideas? Am I missing something here?
 Thanks and have a good one!

                              <span>Hi,
 I was wondering if AD CS has an option to revoke an old certificate if a computer requests a new computer certificate.
 We have several machines who are getting rebuild every week which request a certificate with our CA. I would like to have the certificates which got request before the client got re-installed to be revoked, but I dont see any option which allows me to do this.
 Does anyone know if this is an option within AD CS?

                              <span>Hi All
 Yesterday we had an alert from Microsoft 365 Defender (our Licenses are on 365 E5) notifying us of “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected “. Yikes!
 To cut a long story short, our security stack has contained the threat and the single device in question is nuked – We looped in 3rd party security to sense check everything.
 The threat was a Gootloader infection and Google suggests this is particularly nasty and sophisticated. The payload is a zip file with a .js file inside and from our investigation, the .js script needs to be executed, launched via WScriptexe. We implement best practice in our IT stack and are on-top of hardening our environment where ever possible. In this instance the payload was downloaded to a temp directory where Applocker blocks execution. But had the zip/.js file been downloaded to the desktop, it would have potentially executed.
 1 suggested rudimentary mitigation for this is to change the file association of .js files (via Group Policy) to open with Notepad so if a user does click a .js file, it will harmlessly open in notepad - We have done this. 
 But I have seen further recommendations to do the same for .vbs, .vbe, .jse, .hta and .wsf. I’m wondering if anyone else does this and if this could break anything for end users?

 Anyone experienced something similiar?

But out of these ones, the one that stands out the most for us was the Netwrix one due to the &quot;activities&quot; approach, the capacity of using phantom accounts, etc.
 I want to know if there are ppl here familiar with them.

                              <span>Hi all, potentially not a question for this subreddit but I am a sysadmin! 
 My boss has handed me his old work issued Samsung A10 that is completely locked down using SOTI mobicontrol. The kicker is that the company that this phone belongs to doesn&#x27;t exist anymore and so we are unable to get an admin to unlock the phone. Furthermore, I have contacted SOTI directly and because the company doesn&#x27;t exist anymore they don&#x27;t have permission to unlock it so they can&#x27;t help me.
 I can&#x27;t seem to figure out a way to unlock it - they have me beat at every turn.
 - Developer options is blocked
 - In recovery mode, there is no option to factory reset the phone
 - I am able to get into the settings for about a minute before the mobicontrol kicks in when I restart the phone - otherwise settings is completely disabled
 - The factory reset setting is completely greyed out.
 - In recovery mode, the bootloader is blocked out | when I try to open it, it just says downloading forever with a green screen
 Any methods I can try to get this phone reset or alternatively get soti mobicontrol off the device? Or is the device doomed for eternity?
 Any help would be much appreciated!

                              <span>Without going into detail, I gave a family member of mine a beautiful enterprise laptop that I got for free out of a HW refresh a few years ago. For some reason this relative decided rather than going to me when they had a problem they would run straight to the local &quot;repair shop&quot; as he apparently was chatted up by one of their staff while he was at the chippy.
 This &quot;repair shop&quot; (and I use this dubiously) has made a fucking botch to put it lightly. They claimed he had a virus and that his &quot;hard drive&quot; (actually an SSD) was destroyed by it and he would need a replacement which he happily agreed to. They installed a &quot;new&quot; hard drive and sent it back to him, obviously with slower performance on acc. of having an SSD swapped for a HDD and no effort made to reinstall any of the laptop&#x27;s basic drivers which can be pulled off the manufacturer&#x27;s site with a few minutes on Googles, so this relative had no sound, no WiFi (lucky they use a cable connection, really!) and a prompt to activate Windows.
 When they took it back, they had the sense to call me this time. When I went back with this relative, they had kindly replaced his hard drive with a &quot;solid state drive&quot; and would only charge him £150, what a fucking deal! I actually had a look at the laptop at the shop and it was in the same state as before, no effort to reinstall any drivers, probably was just the same SSD they took out reinstalled and sold back to him at cost, and a prompt to activate Windows. I quite bluntly told them to fuck off, gave them an earful and walked out with my relative and the laptop in tow. Considering either legal or lethal action to get these tw@s to stop bothering him.
 Also, the fucking screws are threaded on the underside so good luck to me getting into that fucker again. At least they had the decency to install another SSD but that&#x27;s nearly £100 of this relative&#x27;s money down the fucking drain.

                              <span>Long story short, and long before my time at this business, someone decided to use free gmail accounts to be used as sign ins for free slack accounts. Ouch.
 We&#x27;ve just made the move from Slack to Teams, and I want to close the gmail accounts completely. These accounts don&#x27;t have phone numbers or alternate emails for verification, and I got through 10 using my mobile number but even after waiting a week I can&#x27;t use it any further ( Unavailable because of too many failed attempts. Try again in a few hours. )
 What&#x27;s the best way to either get in touch with Google or otherwise get these accounts blown off the face of the earth?

                              <span>Just looking for a bit of advice here..
 A friend of mine works at Company A, and they have just been purchased by Company B.
 Both Company&#x27;s have their own MSP, neither have any in-house IT.
 Company B&#x27;s MSP are charging £11k to migrate Company A&#x27;s O365 Tenancy away from Company A.
 There are 25 Users in this tenancy.
 I think this is very excessive in terms of cost, but I am not 100% what is involved so maybe it is correct.
 Does anybody have experience with this and can indicate if this cost is reasonable?

 When you reorder the shared calendars in Outlook then close it down and reopen they go back to the default order?

                              <span>Hello,
 we currently have a strange issue.
 Our customer has 6 AVD session hosts with FSLogix in use.
 The issue: Sometimes a specific program won&#x27;t start anymore on the vm a user is connected to. They have to connect with one of the other session hosts. On that session host it works for 1-2 days and afterwards the same issue occurs.
 The software is not installed on the vms but is started directly from a mapped network drive. It doesn&#x27;t add or edit registry keys and only caches files in one specific folder in AppData. We already excluded that folder from the FSLogix redirection but it didn&#x27;t make a difference.
 The only solution that works is to delete the FSLogix profile and create a new one.
 Additionally, Excel doesn&#x27;t seem to work great either. Users have to restart it every few minutes because of freezing and crashing. Same thing, if the FSLogix profile will be deleted and be newly created it works again for a few days.
 So it seems there is something wrong with FSLogix. We already updated to the newest version and tried both normal caching and cloud cache.
 Weirdly I couldn&#x27;t find anything or anyone on google regarding to this issue.
 Did anyone of you experience similiar issues or has an idea how to fix this? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi. 
 We have Roaming Profiles and Folder Redirection reasonably heavily deployed amongst our on-premises clients. Recently a number of our long term staff who were very experienced with setting these up and troubleshooting issues with these have left, and the replacements we hired have no experience. RP and FR have been pretty stable for us, but we get a couple of issues a month I guess, and we aren&#x27;t really having much luck getting on top of them. 
 I am keen to track down some resources on setting up and troubleshooting Roaming Profiles, including slow logins, errors regarding logging on with locally cached profile, and other common issues like a new profile directory being created locally each time a user logs in.
 I&#x27;d also be interested in tracking down information on how to turn off roaming profiles if we want to stop using them, without losing the profile data and just general troubleshooting in this area. 
 Totally happy to pay for training materials, just really keen to get the new people up to snuff so we don&#x27;t spend hours and hours troubleshooting and or fixing RP Issues.

                              <span>Hello,
 we have had a strange problem with our print server (Win2019 1809) for quite some time.
 If employees try to print a document in the morning, it is sent to the print server, but not printed out immediately. The document is not printed until an admin connects to the server via RDP connection. After the RDP connection, all documents are printed out. This applies to all printers that are connected via a print server.
 1.) The print server can be reached permanently via ping, even in the morning.
 2.) LAN card (Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power) is not checked.
 3.) VMware Tools up to date
 I suspect that during the night some service hangs up. However, I have no idea which one.
 Have you already had a similar phenomenon and can you give me a tip in which event log I can find it?

                              <span>Hi all,
 A few months ago at my job, I managed to transfer 5PB of data across continents with just these tools tools - rsync, gnu parallel, tmux and gdu. Had to use these tools because the environments didn&#x27;t allow to install any other ones. This was my first time doing a transfer of such a scale with such tight constraints on tools and managed to complete it in approx. 3 months. Given this information, how would you rate this work? 1) Based! Would hire you for triple the pay 2) Ok 3) Meh!Unimpressive.

                              <span>HI! 
 Im working at a startup selling saas. 
 We have just got our first client in eu and are looking at more in other countries and struggling to figure out how to respect data sovereignty. 
 We have a very basic IIS server mysql server and this runs everything. We would like to place a server in eu and other countries, and store the data and files for those countries users, on those servers.
 The catch is, there is a few &quot;global&quot; databases that need to be accessed on all servers. 
 Running the application on our current server and using a database in another country does not seem to work well due to latency. I have tested installing IIS on this second location, using a different domain and connecting back to our global databases so only certain requests have additional latency. 
 But this all seems really stupid, surely there is a better way.

I know I can enable anonymous but when you have 30-40 people calling in, would like to be able to identify who they are. I assume their no way to do this but wondering if anyone have a idea how to identify people by their number.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a networking guy who&#x27;s trying to branch out to learn more about servers &amp; systems. As part of this I am deploying a lab, and I&#x27;d like my lab to be fairly representative of what an enterprise would be doing in real life.
 Typically would your domain controllers also be DNS servers, or would you seperate out those roles? Also, (assuming an on-prem deployment) where do you place domain controllers &amp; DNS servers? Do campuses &amp; large branches often have their own, or are they coming back to a central data center?

                              <span>two days in a row i get the call. once from a sysadmin and once from a developer. 
 DEV: Hey dasreboot, that certificate you put on the server doesnt work
 Me: What url are you trying to use?
 DEV: Im on the server and its https://localhost:8080
 Me: neither localhost nor the ip address is listed on that certificate. How did you think that would work?
 It wouldnt be so bad except that they bring it up in meetings. &quot;I&#x27;m blocked cuz dasreboots certificates dont work.&quot;
 Had one tell me last week that the problem was that we were using a self-signed root cert. 
 I swear everyone in the entire group thinks certificates are just magic.

 In the past 24 hours, we sent notification of a node failure impacting your cloud server listed above. 
 Despite extensive efforts, our attempts to manually recover your cloud server were unsuccessful. 
 Our engineering team is currently deploying new instances with the same operating system and IP assignments. You may also deploy a Backup, or Snapshot on a new instance, with a new IP if you prefer. 
 Our staff will be applying a two month account credit for the affected services shortly.

Their extensive effort was about 3.5 hours. No technical explanation. Probably running RAID 0.
 Absolute legends...
 Time to restore I guess...

                              <span>I read a really good article a month or two ago from a security person (I think) who basically said
 &quot;I used to play pranks on people who didn&#x27;t lock their computer. Now I just lock it for them. If I see someone in a coffee shop walk away and leave their computer unattended, rather than being a dick I just keep an eye on it until they come back&quot;
 Obviously heavily paraphrased - but that was the jist of it. 
 I know it is a long shot - but I am trying to find this article again and drawing a complete blank. Every time I try to google it I get hundreds of pages of search results for the best pranks to pull on people who leave their computers unlocked.
 And yes - switching their mouse from right to left handed or rotating their screen 90 degrees is amusing, but not what I am looking for right now...
 Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.

 Looking for any insights from folks that have or had used it. Good, bad, and ugly. Also if there are alternatives that do the same or close to the same. It’s pricy - I think doable but pricy. Thanks in advance.

 They had this reported issue the weekend before last. At the EXACT SAME TIME, one of my larger clients that is on Zscaler started having a similar issue as well, which Zscaler claims to have &quot;resolved&quot;. But the ROOT of the issue has nothing to do with Microsoft. Zscaler is sending traffic out the wrong data center. 
 All of our traffic at the same time this incident was posted, started routing out through their Mexico data center. Despite me pointing out numerous times that these two issues seem related, support wouldn&#x27;t accept this because that posted issue talks about 365 (even though it&#x27;s only 365 simply not allowing logins due to some Zscaler traffic/routing/geo issue.

                              <span>In the last week I&#x27;ve gotten a bunch of reports from different users about getting &quot;We&#x27;ve updated your phone number&quot; notification emails from Capital One. Most of these users don&#x27;t have accounts with the bank so were reporting phishing emails.
 I thought it was a standard phishing mass attack posing as a bank then hitting lots of people to try to get people with an account there, but after looking into it they&#x27;re actually coming from Capital One. At least they&#x27;re coming from the same IPs and domains as confirmed legit Capital One emails. 
 So far we&#x27;ve gotten at least a hundred of these emails. They have all the looks of a phishing campaign. They&#x27;re hitting old and disabled accounts as well as current legit ones. 
 There&#x27;s nothing malicious I&#x27;ve found in the emails. The embedded links all go to the correct sites. So I&#x27;m not sure what the point of the emails are. 
 I&#x27;ve reached out to their abuse email address, but doubt I&#x27;ll hear much back. 
 Has anyone else seen anything going on like this?

I know Apple is stuffed to the gills with fuckery, but there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s that fucking stupid, right? Right???

                              <span>Quite often, I have to deal with this situation. Is it just me?
 Ticket : COMputrer borken
 Description: none
 Me: (After spending 5 minutes gazing into the abyss, forces self to call user)
 &quot;Hi, can you walk me through what exactly you are experiencing?&quot;
 User: &quot;Well, I got up this morning and had coffee. My coffee was cold so I warmed it up. One minute ought to do it, but sometimes it&#x27;s too hot, so I put an ice cube in it. I don&#x27;t like putting ice in my coffee, because it&#x27;s supposed to be hot. If I wanted iced coffee I would have got iced coffee, its different, ya know? I might be the only one in my family who likes coffee except my Uncle Jim who is the only other one who likes it. Now that&#x27;s funny because he hates cats but I love cats. My cats names are...
 1 hour and 0 pauses for reply later
 ... and then I flushed the toilet and sat back down at my desk. I turned my computer on and my icons on my desktop &quot;look different&quot;. Can you make them &quot;look normal&quot; again? I liked that layout better!
 What on earth does their workday look like? Good Gravy! Where do they find time? Why do I have to engage in extended social foreplay just to get an answer to a simple question?

                              <span>I did it. I screwed up.
 I have 2x 2019 domain controllers. Deployed and promoted 2x 2022 DC&#x27;s. Waited a few days for replication to happen. Moved FSMO roles to the new DC&#x27;s, demoted the first 2019 DC. Shutdown the 2nd 2019 server... then all hell broke loose. Apparently, the 2 new DC&#x27;s are still waiting for initial replication to complete. The old 2019 server is saying it&#x27;s been 392 days since it connected with a partner and won&#x27;t replicate with any others until it does so.
 I screwed up by not checking my DC logs before shutting removing the first DC. Let that be a lesson to everyone doing an upgrade. Always check your logs.
 Now I am stuck with 2 DC&#x27;s who are waiting for initial replication to complete with another DC who thinks it is too out of date to talk to anyone. What are my options? How can I tell the old DC that it can replicate with other devices? Can I force the new DC&#x27;s to believe what they have been transferred is a complete sync?
 EDIT:
 I was able to resolve my issue by going on to the 2019 DC and changing the MaxOfflineTimeInDays to beyond the number of days that the DC thought it had been disconnected by issuing the following command and then restarting the DFSR service:
 wmic.exe /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path DfsrMachineConfig set MaxOfflineTimeInDays&#x3D;450
 After that, I forced replication on both the new 2022 DC&#x27;s who were able to complete initial synchronization. Thanks to everyone for their help!

                              <span>Hello, 
 We are writing to inform you that a vulnerability has been discovered within a Veeam® Backup &amp; Replication™ component that could allow an unauthenticated user request encrypted credentials that could lead to them gaining access to backup infrastructure hosts. This affects all Veeam Backup &amp; Replication versions. 
 We have developed patches for V11 and V12 to mitigate this vulnerability and we recommend you update your installations immediately. If you are not the current manager of your Veeam environment, please forward this email to the proper person. If you use an all-in-one Veeam appliance with no remote backup infrastructure components, you can also block external connections to port TCP 9401 in the backup server firewall as a temporary remediation until the patch is installed. 
 Veeam has a long-standing commitment to ensuring our products protect customers from any potential risk. As part of this, we run a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) for all our products. In mid-February, a security researcher identified and reported this vulnerability for Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v11 and v12 with a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating high severity. We immediately reviewed and confirmed the vulnerability and developed an update that resolves the issue.
 If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact Veeam support: https://my.veeam.com/#/open-case/step-1
 Thank you,
 Veeam Customer Support

 I&#x27;ll start with my top 3 never mentions:
 Networking past a layer 2/3 switch. I&#x27;m plenty capable of doing all kind of fancy things with networks, but truthfully I just hate it. I can&#x27;t stand doing network planning and carving out subnets, managing VIPs, QoS, all the VLANs, etc. etc. It&#x27;s just boring and tedious to me. I learned my lesson early when I temporarily took over for a netadmin position at a previous job while we looked for a new one. Never again. Now I pretend like the only thing I know about networking is related to hosts and proxies.

                              <span>I wanted to get some input from the community about your security posture regarding DMA Attacks. We are currently pushing for NIST 800-171 and CMMC Level 2 but, my organization&#x27;s current stance is causing some serious issues within the company. Currently we seem to be getting multiple tickets almost daily about users monitors, keyboards, and mice not working when they go to sign in for the day. If I turn off certain DMA protections everything works like it should. I have proposed to my management that we should consider disabling these for the sake of making this easier for our users. Can any of you chime in on how you are dealing with these issues?

                              <span>I work in an industry/company chocked full of users past retirement age, but typically they’re very with it or switch to consulting before losing their sharpness. 
 However my whole team (servicedesk) has noticed a very senior manager starting to really behave strangely. We’re very astute when it comes to noticing brain fog, tiredness, distraction; it’s none of those things. 
 Is there anything I should do other than provide more attentive support? Let HR know, or an even more senior leader?

I’m trying to add a user to a folder through the security tab to give them access to the folder but I get a message saying “Remotely setting permissions on the folder at the root of a share removes all inherited permissions from the root folder and all subfolders. To set permissions without removing the inherited permissions dick No and either change the permissions on a child folder or make the change while logged in locally. Do you want to continue”
 I tried looking online for solutions as well as on here but I couldn’t find any and was wondering if someone could help me on here.

 I have two domains which are no longer existence, and haven&#x27;t been for a long while.
 I want to cleanup the metadata of that domain in our primary domain. Trusts etc. are still visible (transitive trust) and in sites and services they are still visible.
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it, ntdsutil is no option because there isn&#x27;t a DC anymore for that domains.
 I am not certain what my options are now? Does any one of you ever encountered this?
 Thanks in advance,
 Kind regards,
 Roy

                              <span>Not sure if this is going to apply to anyone but if you are using a on-premise Radius/MFA Server in a Microsoft environment I highly recommend transitioning to SAML. 
 In particular my company just upgraded from some old ASAs to a MX-105 in HA, it was a bitch to set up the static routes between a old Cisco switch and a MX. One of the perks is being able to configure SAML in Azure AD. It just seems like alot more wholesome and customizable way to allow and configure Anyconnect VPN access with MFA. 
 Feel free to comment or DM me if you have any questions or want help!

                              <span>This might be a long shot... But I&#x27;m hoping that somewhere out there, someone has faced the same issue and maybe even found a fix.
 We have a bunch of Windows 10 Pro clients, and some Windows 11 Pro clients, which were initially on-prem domain joined, but have since become hybrid joined with AAD.
 My issue is that our users (about 500) have license for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, but only about half of the clients are running Business, the rest is stuck on Pro.
 Now, for some reason, it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to find any documentation on how this edition change actually works or should happen. Everything on MS, both on Learn and TechNet concerns Enterprise only, and even our CSP&#x27;s licensing experts couldn&#x27;t give a straight answer. (The first guy I spoke to, even claimed that there was no such thing as &quot;Windows 10 Business&quot;... o.O )
 Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a KMS key specifically for &quot;Business&quot;, because if there was, I could just have the clients run a slmgr script silently, and that&#x27;d be the end of it -- and &quot;just buy E3&quot; (as another &quot;expert&quot; from our CSP suggested) is not en option either.
 Any insights, pointers or even encouraging comments are highly welcome and greatly appreciated.

 I am a fairly new sysadmin, bit over 1 year of experience. Having to start to deal with DNS a bit more now, and while i understand the very basics, most of it is still quite confusing to me and im struggling to follow guides because i don&#x27;t have a great understanding of the fundamentals. Are there any guides, series, certs, websites that go in depth about DNS?

                              <span>Hello, 
 As a student, I have been assigned to create an app that solves a specific problem. I have come up with an idea for a Hyper-V manager app that I think would be useful. However, I want to make sure that my app is more comprehensive than just monitoring Hyper-V. Therefore, I would like to hear your thoughts on what features are lacking in existing tools, like Windows Admin Center or any other tools you use, that you believe should be included in a Hyper-V manager app. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin!
 I am reaching out to ask what would be a nice thing to do for some admins that helped me out. Quick background, I started a new job a few months ago and was put in charge of building up a small mobile network with VMs, VoIPs, printers, WiFi, etc. I had a few people that came in and helped me put it all together. We had our first event recently and were complimented on how well everything ran. There were some issues to iron out but for the most part, it went really well. What would be the best way to thank them for their efforts? Keep in mind, they are not part of my organization, I am not a manager in anyway, I have no power to increase their salaries or get them a bonus. Thinking either taking them out to dinner or getting them each a small gift or something else. Any ideas on what would be good?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me. I work in the education sector as a Network Admin and I&#x27;m looking to clear down user profiles en-masse using PDQ Deploy and Powershell but I&#x27;m running into a few problems.
 We have over 1000 students here all with roaming profiles and 400~ PCs, we are looking at getting rid of roaming at some stage but that&#x27;s by the by.
 So, I tried the following scripts in Powershell:
 Get-ChildItem -path &quot;C:\Users\*&quot; -Exclude Default, Administrator | Remove-Item -Recurse -verbose 
 And simply:
 Remove-Item &#x27;C:\Users\*&#x27; -Exclude Default, Administrator -Force -Recurse 
 The problem is, I&#x27;m getting an Unauthorized Access error. This happens despite running the script with elevated privileges, even locally.
 It has deleted the empty files and subfolders in each account, but leaving files like NTUSER.Dat and &#x27;My Documents&#x27;.
 Would I need to run a script to take ownership/give modify access to all these folders beforehand? Or is there a better method for doing this?
 Thanks in advance.

 some of my users are getting the error &quot;there are not enough system resources to complete this operation&quot; when they are trying to access the address book, no matter which address list they are trying to access.
 i tried all the basic, opening in safe mode, creating new profile, online fix of the installation,reinstalling, moving to a different office edition(2016 to 2019).
 further more tried to activate legacy caching mode, and disabling caching of shared folders.
 when i reinstalled on one workstation it worked fine for a day or two and stated giving the error again

                              <span>Hello fellow Sysadmins.
 A C220 M4 with the latest recommended firmware I am working on displays the following fault messages on latest version diagnostics at Server Health:
 PSU1 PSU1_PWRGD: Power Supply sensor for PSU1, State Asserted
 PSU2 PSU2_PWRGD: Power Supply sensor for PSU2, State Asserted
 The server has two 770W PSU.
 All other subsystems report healthy condition, including CIMC. I have read on Cisco site that there is a similar bug in v3 firmware and it was fixed. I am using v4.1g firmware.
 Research
 How to resolve this situation ?

                              <span>Hey guys, we are currently planning to renew our WIFI infrastructure and want to implent a stable mobile voice solution as well. We wanted to use VoWIFI so we can keep the smartphones that are in use allready.
 We are a manufacturing and metalworking industry with about 400 employees thus having alot of machinery as well as office workplaces.
 We just had a site survey done and the results show that we need to roughly double the amount of APs that are currently in use if we wanted to use VoWIFI.
 That brought up some questions:
 1. What is your experience with VoWIFI?
 2. What is your experience with VOIP Apps on smartphones in daily use?
 2. In what cases would you use VoWIFI and in wich DECT?

                              <span>My company has a shared o365 mailbox for customer support and I wonder if I can fetch statistics for that mailbox. The information I&#x27;m looking for is, 
  
How long does the mail stay unanswered? 
 Individual statistics of who responds, and how many % of the emails they respond too.
  
As the mailbox probably is fairly old, it would be helpful if it was possible to only measure the last X months, otherwise time of employment would impact the stats. 
 I&#x27;m waiting to get a MS o365 admin account, but the people that create them are a tad bit slow. I hope I posted this question in the right sub. I&#x27;m a bit new to all this, having done a drastic career change into IT admin in my mid 30s due to an injury.

                              <span>A client has asked us to replace their old server, with a newer one. 
 Single Domain, 25 users. Folder Redirection and Roaming Profiles. 
 The server was originally at the start, a 2003 SBS server and over the years has been migrated to new hardware with whatever version of Windows was current at the time. The intention is to put Server 2022 on the new Hardware. It&#x27;s currently on 2012R2
 Given how many upgrades it&#x27;s had, we are wondering about whether it would be better to create a new domain from scratch vs trying to do yet another upgrade. There seems to be legacy GPO&#x27;s going back many many many years and we are a little worried that there is stuff in the system now that could be problematic. 
 Before anyone asks, yes they require an on-prem server for another cycle as their LOB application doesn&#x27;t have a cloud equivalent for another 2 years at least. 
 One of the main issues is moving the profiles up and setting them up on the new domain etc.
 ​
 Interested in your thoughts on that.

 I am trying to run a scheduled task to open a URL on a daily basis. I tried using a powershell script with the Invoke-WebRequest command but I keep getting an Invoke-WebRequest : ERROR 
 So I instead set up a scheduled task to run a program (Chrome) and in the argument I added the link to open. That worked fine BUT the scheduled task remains as &quot;Running&quot;. I checked the box to end after one minute but it remains running. Is there a way to stop it?

                              <span>Looking for guidance on an environment with Azure Password Hash Sync Enabled with having Azure AD device joined systems only (No Hybrid). We are slowly migrating client systems to Azure AD joined devices. There are a small handful of on-premise application/file servers remaining in the environment.
 With password hash sync, Users with expired passwords are allowed to access cloud resources normally. However, the rub begins where said user with Azure AD Joined system attempts to access an on-premise resource, which prompts for credentials (Because the password is expired). Simply wondering what the general guidance is to keep passwords synced back to on-premise AD for users logging into Azure AD Join systems. The on-premise AD Password policy matches the Azure Password policy.
 I was thinking about setting &quot;EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers&quot; from this article https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronizatio. Per this setting, the password would need to be changed on-prem first to initiate the enforcement process.

                              <span>Currently have 2 VMW clusters, each using a single Nexus 9300 for all traffic
 For resiliency, we are adding a 2nd Nexus 9300 standalone switch to each vmw cluster(all 10g), and uplink to the distribution switch on separate 1g MMF (Eventually the dist switch will be upgraded to 10g) In case I am explaining poorly, I drew a map, below
 Should I uplink each 9300 to it&#x27;s partner? (as shown in green on the image at https://pasteboard.co/7rlWvcdFysaz.png )
 Or will this cause spanning tree problems? note I do not want to do Virtual Port Channels , as I want each switch to be completely separate

                              <span>Consider the following hub and spoke topology where each vnet spoke utilizes a different front-end IP on the respective load balancer within the hub network for forced tunneling for ingress traffic to be inspected by the pair of NVAs in the hub network.
 https://imgur.com/dYSzKUo
 We can assume that each NIC is assigned a route table with a UDR that points 0.0.0.0/0 to the respective IP (load balancer IPs) shown in the diagram. We can assume that the NVA&#x27;s are running active/active and are configured as backend pool members for each load balancer in the diagram.
 ​
 If both of the load balancer back end pools are configured in the following order:
 Load balancer in 10.0.0.0/24
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.0.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.0.11
 
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
 What would be the effect, if any, upon traffic if the order of one of the back-end pool members were reversed so that it is displayed as follows:
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
 ​
 To provide context, I am trying to understand in what instances does the order of the backend pool on azure load balancers impact and effect traffic flow, and what considerations need to be understood here for this to make sense.
 I would appreciate the communities thoughts on this to help my understanding on this subject.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m lets say a little rusty on routing, was just looking for conformation. sorry if my terminology is not spot on.
 I have an layer 3 switch (Aruba 8320) at the core of my network, it is doing all the routing and is configured with the final route as 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.0.18 (my firewall), however I want to re-route the traffic from VLAN 66 (10.66.0.0/21) to another device (different interface on firewall, as I can enable a captive portal for that vlan only). if these two devices are directly connected I assume the I do the following to re-route the traffic.
 Configure firewall interface: 192.16.30.5/29
 Configure layer 3 switch interface: 192.168.30.6/29
 Configure route in layer 3 switch: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.5
 the bit I&#x27;m unsure of is do I need to configure a vlan for 19.168.30.0/29
 interface vlan 30
 description Guest_Wireless_VLAN
 ip address 192.168.30.2/29
 active-gateway ip mac e2:ff:5e:ac:09:07
 active-gateway ip 192.168.30.1
 and change the route to: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.1 or keep it the same
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, I would like to know your opinion regarding how change and risk management is done in your organizations. I am particularly interested in risk management (not security risk but potential impacts due to change).
 The ITIL framework is useful however there is an element that I struggle with, potential customers impacts, normally when defining potential, we might think as the worst case scenario, but even small simple changes could have big potential impact if we consider a typo when adding a new policy in an existing vrf, someone might say deleting or modifying policies are riskier, and I would normally agree, but when it comes to typos, missing a statement, wrong IP, community tag, etc, could have severe consequences.
 In my organization we have defined these categories to come with a number, the number will fall under ITIL thresholds, P1-P4, these are the categories:
 Potential Customer Impact, it is based on the activity being performed and the amount of customers potentially impacted.
 Type Element, it is a grouping that depends on type of element, for example, a core IP layer element would have higher value than a Voice or Data(Application layer) element.
 Service Area, based on the geographical area that the element is providing services, example, it could be region of a country, a state, it could be within a city.
 Service Density, amount of actual services that the element is supporting.
 As you can see, Type, Service Area and Service Density are based on the element where the work is going to be performed, but the Potential Customer Impact is based on the activity itself only.
 My struggle is finding a good balance in the risk management for the activity itself as there are many details like typos or missing small pieces of configuration that could create a big impact even though the activity itself could be a simple one. 
 How does your organization manage risk from changes? What ideas can you share with me based on the above?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a pair of firewalls running vyos 1.3.2. Vyos uses keepalved for vrrp.
 Currently I&#x27;ve got VRRP running with rfc3768 compatibility, which means vyos creates virtual interfaces with virtual mac addresses for the virtual address.
 Unfortunately rfc3768 comes with plenty of hoops and bugs on vyos currently and I was wondering what is the likely outcome if I disable rfc3768 support? keepalived will send GARP packages on failover and then resend it after a delay. Do you have experience with equipment missing/ignoring garp packets and not failing over?

                              <span>I am looking for spine switch and end up decided between following two cisco module 
 9405 Chassis based switch
 9364c Fixed port 
 Both above switch. provides 100Gbps ports and assuming they provide same performance but Which model is good for management/operation point of view? 
 We have 20 Racks and i believe 9364c should be enough to last long but just wanted to compare with 9504 chassis and see if anyone has any opinion on above two kind of hardware?

                              <span>Hi, I was wondering if you all could have a look at what I&#x27;ve researched as of today regarding a summary of coding modulations and let me know of any feedback you might have? 
 I have a section where there is a question mark in brackets regarding wider channels, etc.. and I&#x27;m unsure of this bit and what a wider channel technically gives you. Yes, I know it means more data being sent, thus faster speeds, etc.. but when it comes down to it, QAM 1024 is sending 1024 different phases combinations in each transmission either on 20Mhz or 80Mhz, so what is 80Mhz doing behind the scenes with QAM that 20Mhz can&#x27;t do? Is it sending more QAM 1024 transmissions?
 Thanks...
 Coding modulations are a way of sending more binary digits through each phase combined with transmitting more phase combinations …</span>

                              <span>Hi all I have a Fortigate 100F (running HA) and Juniper Mx4300 layer 3 switches. I am planning on creating multiple VLANS to separate network traffic/resources. I know I can create the VLANS and use IRB/SVI (logical ports) for the VLAN routing and connect the switches with trunk links and setup some DHCP forwarding (ip-helper) addresses on the IRB interfaces to leverage the DHCP ranges on the Fortigate 100F, But I wasn&#x27;t sure about the connection from the switch to the Fortigate. Is that considered a trunk link too? I would think it would just be a standard link and then you have the routing to the VLANs setup on the router with static/dynamic routes or whatever. Or is there an easier way to do this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway it got me thinking…I would really like to work on some fresh innovative ideas to help create value for my team outside of the normal network deployment projects… the problem is, I can’t really think of anything to do…
 Does anyone have any suggestions of innovative ideas, either simple or complex that helped really add value to their team?

 ——
 Boss -
 I have an e-mail out to VAR to confirm lead times of both platform APs, but barring some notable surprise on delivery dates – I’m landing on Juniper Mist for (Corporate Office). As discussed briefly today, I narrow the conversation down to (3) primary areas of focus.
 Performance + Capability There were some noteworthy differentiators re: how similar functions are approached between the platforms. Mist APs were designed w/ an additional radio dedicated to nothing but collecting analytics for proactive correlation and RF optimization. Aruba has attempted to copy the same behavior…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 Recently I&#x27;ve configured HSRP on our core switches. Because of the physical limitations of our fiber connections, we only have one trunk interface as the heartbeat interface between the two core switches. I set Core Sw1 as primary for all VLANs and Core Sw2 as the secondary for all VLANs. The configurations were successful and when I pull the ethernet cable going to our ASA, the traffic still flows through Core Sw2. However, when I unplug Core Sw1, we lose connection on the entire network. 
 Quickly explaining our Core to ASA connection: the connection from Core Sw1 and Core Sw2 is a single cable connection from each of the Core Switch. We only have one ASA running on the network at the moment.
 What could be causing this problem? I brought up setting up STP root manually so that the VLANs have a cost to follow to the Distribution then to Core Switches, but my Supervisor is insisting that doesn&#x27;t matter. If I can get a clear technical explanation as to why our failover isn&#x27;t happening when Core Sw1 loses power it will be very helpful.

 My original plan was to use spare Meraki MS120&#x27;s as the breakouts, but the MSP said it was a bad idea due to licensing, despite me showing them a known working config for exactly this use case. Instead they recommended 2 dumb L2 switches.
 I&#x27;m not a network person specifically, but I can handle the basics of Meraki. I&#x27;m just not sure what config is needed for these 1000&#x27;s.
 If I follow what my plan was for the MS120&#x27;s, this is what the config would look like for the 1000&#x27;s
 How wrong is this? And if this is somehow the right idea, I&#x27;m assuming there is more to do on the config...any advice?

                              <span>Hi All. We are an IT consulting form and commonly perform site surveys for clients. Most of our clients have small to medium sized sites with between 5-20 APs. Lots of small warehouse clients that we do this for.
 Currently we use free predictive wireless heatmapping tools, and the free Wi-Fi analyzer tool to provide heatmaps and recommendations to clients. We basically use the existing AP placements and predictive heatmap tool to make an approximated heat map, then go onsite and use Wi-Fi analyzer to confirm the accuracy of the predictive heatmap and look for interference and optimal channels to set. It&#x27;s pretty manual but fairly easy/not complex for us to do.
 Also we help them by recommending Wi-Fi settings such as the channels, etc. This has seemingly been enough for our clients and they&#x27;ve been happy with the results. We&#x27;re able to make plenty of recomendations using our method.
 We&#x27;ve actually had clients tell us that another competitor came in and did a survey with other (paid) tools and the reports were overly confusing to them and took too long.
 We&#x27;re starting to raise our prices for site surveys more towards what our competitors are charging, so I&#x27;m looking into paid site survey tools to see if they can provide anymore value to clients or efficiency on our end. 
 What would ya&#x27;ll recommend? We do around 1-2 surveys a month, mostly for small clients like I described above. I would prefer something cloud based, something we can easily install/license on our laptops (for our team of 5 engineers), no physical tool, and affordable (don&#x27;t think we need something like Ekahau for these smaller surveys?). Right now I&#x27;m looking at NetSpot. 
 Please let me know what you would recommend and why.

                              <span>Anyone here familiar with Nokia and their certifications. I am interested in obtaining few of their certifications just because they have good opportunities internationally. One of their fundamental certifications that I would like to obtain is the 4A0-100 which focuses on Nokias product line service routing. Nokia does offer online courses but they are very expensive and it is very difficult finding self-study resources. I would love to know if you have any experience with Nokia or have any suggestions regarding their certifications.

                              <span>Hello All! I have my BGP Neighbors setup with 2 different carriers. I have my own /23 and 2 /24 subnets I need to announce and route these ip allocations to both neighbors for my ips to be able to resolve over the internet
 My issue I am having is that my ips are not routing globally. Just internally. Is their anyone who could assist me in the proper commands/config?
 I don&#x27;t mind paying someone to assist me.

                              <span>Symptoms:
 -OSPF adjecency fully established-No routes received over OSPF adjacency on either end-Traffic goes the long way around
 Cause:
 -I have accidentally skipped adding the OSPF point to point subinterface to &#x27;mpls ldp&#x27;.
 Question: Why did OSPF not send routes over a P2P subinterface, even when an adjacency was fully established, just because I skipped putting the subinterface into MPLS(accidentaly)? It seems that this is happening even before route-path-cost calculations.
 FYI it is fixed now. And it was the same on OSPFv3.

                              <span>As a result of a merger, we&#x27;re moving two schools into the same new building and we&#x27;re planning the new network accordingly. Within the first couple years, the two schools will operate independently, however staff from both schools will be sharing staffrooms, printers, libraries and halls. We want to ensure that, whatever the solution, network resources belonging to the two schools are safely kept isolated.
 At the moment, one school is running users and computers in a Windows Workgroup in a very simple scenario, while the second school has a more advanced setup, which is depicted here: https://i.ibb.co/8XVYw3F/unnamed-1.jpg
  
Core LAN (not into a VLAN) for on premise trusted Windows devices and AD servers
 Staff VLAN, for BYOD devices and mobile phones
 Guest VLAN for students :school chromebooks and BYOD
 Printers VLAN, shared with the above LANs and VLANs, inbound only traffic
 PBX VLAN, runs traffic from DECT and softphones
  
Assuming that, as for the merger, users and computers from the first school will be moved into an AD Domain, we could think of two possible choices:
  
Logically segregate users and computers using two domains, and two &quot;zones&quot;, which implies duplicating the above network design. Manage two domains, two isolated groups of WIFI networks, plus a shared network, which would be more tedious to manage, but maybe more secure, or
 Integrate users and computers into a unique domain, manage a shared network infrastructure, ensuring that a granular and hardened access control to resources is in place. More flexible, but more prone to &quot;attacks&quot; if not properly designed
  
Of course, brand new network appliances will be thrown in: switches, APs, routers and firewalls.
 With all the above in mind, what solution would you choose? What are your suggestions?

                              <span>I am looking into layer 2 wholesale solutions and would really appreciate some clarification on how IP addressing works.
 Local circuits provided by a wholesaler presented to colo as PPP over L2TP.
 How does IP addressing for customers work? The specific wholesale provider I&#x27;m looking into require a subnet for BGP links and for connecting their LAC to my LNS.
 Do I just use IP addresses within the same subnet I use for the BGP peering or do I use private IPv4 addresses and then CGNAT? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone. My new gig has me maintaining and standing up new IPSec VPN’s on almost weekly basis. It’s kind of my main role here to be honest. Before coming here I had 0 experience with IPSec but I’m learning as I go.
 I have a design question here… seeking wisdom to prevent me from possibly painting myself into a corner. Regarding the phase 1 ikev2 policies, specifically on the Cisco ASA… how should the order look and is there a better way to number all of them?
 Like should a more secure policy be a lower index number than a less secure policy? If you order and index them poorly – could anything be impacted?
 I guess there have been 3 network engineers here in the last 2 years and I see very random numbering... even a random ass Policy 71... it just screams bad design to me but I&#x27;m not familiar with the topic well enough to pin point it.
 Any tips/wisdom is appreciated.

                              <span>I proposed Netbox but it got shutdown very easily by the cybersecurity because it is Opensource. Therefore, it is very bad and not suitable for the environment. There proposal is Solarwinds products.
 I am not too familiar with Solarwinds IPAM. I have used it in the past, but it was so slow that I ended using an excel sheet. I really need to start documenting my network for my team and I.
 This is something I am looking for:
  
IPAM can do multi-tenancy something like a tenant can login and can only view and edit their own IP block
 Can record circuits, etc
 Can record VMs, Containers, bare-metal servers
 Has a capability of documenting racks in the datacenter
 VLANs, VxLAN and VRF information
 Can detect overlapping IP or subnets
  
I have never used infoblox and can&#x27;t really say much about it. At to this point, I need to provide my top 3 products that can be purchased so that it is suitable for enterprise environment. 
 Can you share the paid product you use and can it do a simple DCIM ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling to understand whether a switch is used when terminating L2TP sessions (originating from wholesale l2tp subscriber access). 
 My understanding is that the LNS is usually a router. 
 My confusion is that it&#x27;s common for the PPP L2TP traffic to be VLAN tagged. So you would need a switch to deal with this, right?
 Would really appreciate any help, thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 As per title, could you please advise what could be a good solid replacement for that switch ?
 I would like to add 10+ Gbe connection to support next infrastructure upgrade but I don&#x27;t really know what are the good machines these days. 
 If possible something that not costs an arm and a leg ;)
 Thank you

                              <span>I need your consultation.
 Let me briefly explain the topic I am working on:
 I work on the topic &quot;satellite integrated terrestrial system&quot; and am trying to understand what dynamic functional split and placement of RAN functions.
 I am a newbie and have never been working on these topics. Reading publications and attempting parallel to understand the basic concepts of the functional split, network slicing, and RAN are inefficient for me. I can spend 3-4 hours or more on one 4 pages-paper.
 Could you please help me with understanding the following questions:
  
What is a dynamic functional split? Does it mean that the placement of central(CU), distributed (DU) and radio units (RU) can be changed during transmission?
  
&quot;dynamic&quot; - process or system characterized by constant change, activity, or progress.
  
I have found a lot of publications where Open-Ran is proposed as a promising technology for satellite-integrated terrestrial networks. For a next-generation wireless system, we expect a huge amount of data and such an integrated system can help with overload. Why does Cloud Ran (CRAN) not suitable then?
  
CRAN can support up to hundreds of gigabit data rates cost-effectively without degrading the performance.

I imagine that the packets would have to be process-switched by the CPU due to a lack of TCAM space for all the routes on the internet?

                              <span>HI Folks. I just wanted to confirm what will be the destination against which the packet loss and jitter are measured on the VCE monitor page.
 From my understanding, it should be the primary gateway. I just need some confirmation.

                              <span>Hi there, trying to keep this question as straight forward as possible. I have a client who will be leasing the left half of their large building and working in their right half. They’ll be keeping the ISP hand off in the same data room and will have a large fiber run from the left half to the right. Nothing on the left half of the building will be connected to their network. 
 What’s best practice? Putting the firewall on the ISP side or on the client side of the fiber run? 
 Note: They use unmanaged converters now but I suggested using switching with SPF so we can manage it better and see connection quality, etc. 
 Thanks in advance! This sub is always super helpful.

You don’t have a “work family”, you just have your family. That’s it. I wanted to bring this up as some major changes happened with one of the companies I do contract/client work with. 
 I will not go into specific detail for opsec reasons of course, but this company is based abroad with many different people I know working in the IT department from many different parts of the world. Long story short, the company did a “special holiday week” right before the office was closed for the Christmas/New Years week in a half. The CEO bought lunches for the entire week (those that work in the office), let people off early the entire…</span>

                              <span>Hey all you smart people, kia ora from New Zealand! So we use an on premise version of ServiceDesk Plus (help desk tool) , and it integrates with Endpoint Central (endpoint management tool) they are both via Manage Engine, but looking around for alternatives. Our requirements are it needs to be ITIL centric and handle desktop management, remoting capability as well as handling change control, as well as the usual request /incident logging.
 For a user base of approx 1200 users.
 Anyone moved away from those products to others and have some experiences to share? (if you knew back then what you know now, post migration, would you have chosen another option etc?)
 Cloud is highly preferable for all the reasons.
 Thanks heaps in advance, I didn&#x27;t realise how many options are out there now, and they all promise the world... But I&#x27;d like some real feedback from the coal face. (and not gonna lie, would love to learn from your mistakes/regrets, haha)

                              <span>I took a new job mid last year. I like a lot about it, pays well. One if the things is we need to clean up a server environment. We&#x27;re AWS but they have a local environment in HQ.
 It&#x27;s an absolute mess. They hired me to run point and get it cleaned up along with being a Cloud Engineer.
 There are servers piled high with really resource intensive software. Some on the domain, some not. Nothing central. Easy to resolve. Basic stuff. But noone will hear me or they want to address 1000 things at once.
 There are these two dev servers just piled high. SQL, IIS, Visual Studio, and a huge swath of dev software. And they have developersiterally remoting in and working directly on the servers. Running massive processes in VS.
 I have told the CTO until Im blue in the face... Throwing more resources at these wint solve the issue. Well just keep adding resources. We need to split up some of it. SQL at the least.
 And he just isn&#x27;t hearing my actual point. Saying things like, it&#x27;s a lower env we can have sql and iis on one server. That&#x27;s not my point....
 I got a request this morning and there are two ways to do it. One takes 15 steps, the other way takes 2. The easy way is modifying the config. I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure which setting it was so... I sent an email asking, &quot;Which setting in the configuration is x?&quot; 
 This guy responds, &quot;Yes, you can do it in the config.&quot; It&#x27;s like no matter how I word it - he doesn&#x27;t take my goddammit point and I&#x27;m about to put my foot through a window.
 Like I make this very well and clear point and he says, &quot;Thanks for your inputs but its okay to have x y and z on a single server in a lower env.
 That was never my point. My point was - these vms are going to eat up every fucking thing you give them and well end up in a never ending loop of adding resources and you&#x27;ll never remember that I said it would happen. Instead you&#x27;ll just ask me, why does this keep happening? Like it&#x27;s my fault.....

                              <span>So I never really thought I&#x27;d be making a post like this but that&#x27;s only because I was too busy being an atta boy and not paying attention to the writing on the wall. 
 I&#x27;m a system admin over a very specific set of applications and systems. I&#x27;ve expressed my want to move outside of this role, however those conversations have been fruitless for the most part. I got an opportunity at another company for System Admin in a more traditional IT role. I spoke with my bosses today after telling them about the opportunity and I got the &quot;what can we do to keep you&quot; speech. 
 I feel like my biggest hurdle is my current boss. He knows half as much as I do, does 1/4 of the tickets I do, and delegates every.single.chance he gets. He&#x27;s not a managing Sr, he&#x27;s supposed to be a working Sr admin, which has been made abundantly clear to him via our chain several times, yet still there&#x27;s next to no production from his office. I can&#x27;t get a raise because then I&#x27;ll make more than he does, and I can&#x27;t get promoted because he doesn&#x27;t have any place that&#x27;ll take him, he has a bad work history within our department and is frankly lucky to even have a job at this point. 
 My question is...do I keep sticking around and trudging forward in the hopes that eventually the ice will break and I&#x27;ll get a chance to move? Or do I just pick up my toys and go play someplace else where I can gain traditional IT experience that will go towards my resume if I choose to move again later on? I&#x27;ve been at my current company for 16 years, which makes it harder to just pack up and go.

                              <span>Today marks the day that I can close a chapter.
 ​
 Six months ago, I started a new job, leaving a low-paying on-site technician position at a MSP for in house End User Support at a medium sized company. They offered me the job based on my troubleshooting and Windows admin skill. I was able to quickly get up to speed on the day to day tasks, and after about a month I started tackling a bigger project: the Windows deployment image that was set up by a technician who had left some time ago. It had been put in place in 2015 and has been trucking along ever since. Slowly gaining more and more issues as it aged, but not enough for it to be an emergency. It still worked at least.
 ​
 I began slowly poking at it. First learning how to replicate the image we already had in place (but with better B…</span>

                              <span>For those that don&#x27;t remember or haven&#x27;t seen. There&#x27;s a series of updates that have been released and are being released to address some encryption issues in Active Directory. 
 https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5020805-how-to-manage-kerberos-protocol-changes-related-to-cve-2022-37967-997e9acc-67c5-48e1-8d0d-190269bf4efb

 We were like many others in that the first update kinda broke things and we put in the entry to fix that issue. Then After the 2nd update we&#x27;ve added the auditing and we do see audit entries related to accounts that won&#x27;t work after the final updates. 
 We&#x27;re trying to get way ahead of this so we don&#x27;t have as many issues by the time all is said and done and honestly we&#x27;re really lost on how to handle this. We&#x27;ve been wondering if we need to automate the adjustment to all existing AD accounts and computer objects? Is this going to affect anything that makes an LDAP call instead of LDAPS? Are we overthinking it and it&#x27;s actually not a big deal and it all works itself out through all of the updates? 
 We just don&#x27;t quite understand everything that&#x27;s happening related to these updates and we&#x27;d rather cause some little bumps to get everything ready early versus one massive downtime issue when Microsoft sends out the last update and enforces the new encryption types.

                              <span>Good Afternoon, 
 Today I have noticed a large increase in the emails being flagged by the &quot;Anti-spam outbound policy (Default)&quot; found in https://security.microsoft.com/antispam .
 Anyone else seeing this change? I contacted the users, they send these exact same emails daily and it&#x27;s never been flagged like this. I am wondering if Microsoft has tightened the definitions a bit?

                              <span>It seems a day does not go by I do not get an email &quot;Bob Smith is no longer employed, please give me all of his documents and redirect all of his emails to me&quot;. Rest of the conversation usually goes something like &quot;ME: this has to come from the department head or HR&quot; &quot;USER: But I need it, I am the most important person in this department!!!!!!!!&quot; It&#x27;s useally the same departments, same users over and over again. It would help if HR told us when a user was no longer employed, but that is asking way to much I guess.
 ​
 Edit: Just to be clear, the emails to me are coming from the helpdesk. Getting them to submit tickets is not the problem, getting them to understand they do not have authority is.

                              <span>We had a customer report last week that they received an email from us requesting bank account details change. Normally I would put these down to the usual attempt but something is not right.
 Timeline:
 Email sent from genuine customer trying to make payment.
 Email returned to customer from a slightly different domain name with alternative bank details. It has correct email signature and some original text that one of my users has written.
 Customer queries with us and we realise what is happening and no payment is made.
 Provider contacted to block domain
 We use O365 and the user accounts have MFA. The password was poor for our user, so it has been changed to a new policy we are rolling out.
 Today it has happened again with a different customer and a different domain name - again very close to ours. They were going to make payment and the received a reply from a different domain but with text that looks like it came from us. One of the users involved is on holiday so I have disabled their login but this time a shared email account was spoofed. This account is disabled in AD by default (we are hybrid).
 Feels like we are being hacked somewhere. We are contacting our cyber insurance and I have requested the second domain be taken down. I have also reported to our email security/archiving company.
 Has anyone been affected this way before? What was the outcome?
 A worried thanks.

                              <span>Saw this PC gamer article last night. and immediately thought of this post from a few days ago.
 But then I started thinking - after decades of the &quot;older&quot; generation being just. Pretty bad at operating their equipment generally, if the new crop of folks coming in end up being very, very bad at things and also needing constant help, that&#x27;s going to be very, very depressing. I&#x27;m right in the middle as a millennial and do not look forward to kids half my age being like &quot;what is a folder&quot;
 But at least we can all hold hands throughout the generations and agree that we all hate printers until the heat death of the universe.

                              <span>Hey guys, just got hired at this new firm (60 ish employees) to be their one and only “IT guy”. We recently purchased some laptops and I’ve been tasked to create a golden image and have this installed on all the new laptops. Any recommendations on which software I should use? Or if we were to outsource this to a MSP, what would be an appropriate fee to pay? My background is in unified communications so I’m not 100% when it comes to real hardcore IT stuff. Thanks in advance!
 Update: thanks guys! Really appreciate the recos! Muacks ❤️

                              <span>I have a Dell X1052 switch, I have fully reset the switch to factory settings. The switch is using SW version 3.0.1.9.
 I setup a static IP on VLAN 1 that isn&#x27;t being used by anything else. When I attempt connect to the Web Interface I get the log in screen (using https) and after I log in I see &quot;please wait&quot; and then from after a minute or two I see on the console side that the connection is terminated but the browser gets stuck at Please Wait.
 Any suggestions on what I need to resolve this? Or should I RMA the switch, its got a lifetime warranty?
 Thanks,

                              <span>Hi all, i&#x27;ve read multiple sources even here on Reddit but i have a question for registry settings. We have a time sync issue with a hunderd of Synology NAS that can&#x27;t get the time from our PDCe.
 Is it right to configure HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32time\Config – AnnounceFlag &#x3D; 5 only on PDCe of the Forest Root Domain ?? All the other DCs in the forest (even other PDCe for child forest domains) and Member servers should have been configured with a value of 10.
 On the PDCe of the Forest Root Domain (the one that sync outside) what flag should i use for the peer list ? 0x1 or 0x9 ?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Still getting acclimated to this environment as the sole sysadmin - sorry if this is a dumb or obvious question. 
 We’ve got two Dell NX3240s running Windows Storage Server 2016 connected up to two PowerEdge R440s running an ESXi virtual server environment. When shutting the whole stack down, I’ve gone ahead and powered down all VMs and ESXi. Now on to the storage server. 
 Is there a best practice for safely shutting these things down? I’ve got a monitor, keyboard, and mouse plugged into them. 
 Since anything that would be accessing the storage cluster is powered down, am I good to just shut windows down, starting with the second storage server?

                              <span>Hi there,
 My manager wants to start using some form of MDM at our organisation, we haven&#x27;t used it in the past as the number of users and devices was negligible, but we&#x27;re at the point now where we need to start looking at implementing it. He is dead set on using Microsoft Intune/Endpoint Manager to do this. All our identity management is done via Azure AD. We essentially want to:
  
Allow users to log into any device using their Microsoft 365 account
 Deploy applications that the specific user is allowed to use, this should be able to be done on any device
 Push auto-updates, auto shutdown and remotely monitor devices
  
Is Intune/Endpoint Manager the ideal piece of software to do this? Are there any alternatives I could suggest even though my manager is dead set on it, as Intune/Endpoint Manager has so many features that we may not need? Also, are the requirements above feasible on Intune/Endpoint Manager?

                              <span>In order to increase room on the network for our rapidly growing office (with many lab devices as well), we decided to split the wireless network into a separate VLAN/subnet. That&#x27;s all well and good but our three printers (HP MFPs) are all Ethernet only. Our original subnet that remains ethernet based is 10.1.26.0 /24 and the new WLAN one is 10.1.29.0 /24. They are connected on the back end via our Cisco layer three switch and talk to each other fine. 
 People, when they&#x27;re hard-wired, are able to print with no issue as before. However, I noticed that when on the new wireless network, they are having trouble reaching the printers that they have added on the other, hardwired based subnet with the drivers they have (though of course they can ping and access the web interface IPs fine). So far the solution is to remove those old drivers (added through the basic Microsoft &#x27;add a printer&#x27; feature), go to the HP website and download/install the full official driver, skip past the step where it scans the network and can&#x27;t find anything, and then manually input the IP address of the printer on the other subnet of 10.1.26.0. This then seems to work for both the wireless and ethernet subnets. But it is a few extra steps and a bit of work for the users, who sometimes may get confused or don&#x27;t have time.
 Also, I noticed if you just use the basic Microsoft &#x27;add a printer&#x27;, &#x27;can&#x27;t find printer I&#x27;m looking for&#x27;, &#x27;manually enter the printer IP address&#x27;, it just finds some generic or universal print driver that is not the most descriptive or useful, as it can&#x27;t seem to find or offer an option for the actual precise driver.
 Anyway my main question is, is there a simpler way to do this, and advertise the printer easily and directly on both networks, or just make the existing printer installs on user machines work on both?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having an issue for a while where every time I reboot my PC the Xbox app gets pinned to my taskbar. I usually just unpin it and move on, but I finally got sick of it and decided to do something about it. I think I tracked the problem down to [C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\LayoutModification.xml]
 Is it safe for me to simple outright delete this file? If not, what does the default file look like so I can adjust it without accidentally breaking something? When trying to google the answer I get a ton of results on how make adjustments using it, but I can&#x27;t seem to find whether or not I can safely delete it.

                              <span>Yesterday someone tried to login to my Synology NAS through SSH. It was a bruteforce attack, so it was permanently blocked after they tried a few times. What worries me is that I really don&#x27;t know how have they done it. The SSH port that I&#x27;m using, which is not even the default (22), is only accesible through LAN and scanning it returns a closed port.
 Let me briefly describe my setup:
  
ISP router in bridge mode.
 Mini-pc running pfSense Community Edition v2.6.0.
 Synology NAS connected to pfSense.
  
​
 Pfsense config
  
upnp disabled.
 A few ports open for some of the NAS services, with the corresponding firewall rules.
  
​
 Synology NAS config
  
SSH is enabled and running on a port which is NOT open in pfsense. It is only accesible through LAN. I&#x27;ve tried accessing it through WAN and I can&#x27;t.
 SFTP enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 WebDAV enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 Torrent client running on a docker container. The TCP port is fixed and upnp is disabled on the client.
  
Was this hacker exploiting a pfsense vulnerability? Or maybe a Synology&#x27;s vulnerability? Or am I doing something wrong? Surprisingly, neither the SFTP nor the WebDAV had any intrusion.

 I would like to build some sort of GUI that my team can access through a regular browser that would run a powershell script using variables provided in the GUI and throws out the result. 
 For example I want to know which users are currently logged in on a Windows PC. I open the website
 search for &quot;Check logged users in a Workstation&quot;, get linked to the right page where i can enter the PC name, click OK and get the list of users requested. 
 Do you guys know any good tool to achieve this? Or have any ideas on how you would approach this?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a class of 32 PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Version1809.
 Recently I&#x27;ve installed some software &#x27;Autodesk Inventor 2023&quot;. Since then. on around 2/3 of the PCs the domain accounts take around 10-15 minutes to load up, and when it finally logs in comes up with the error shown in the photo on this page (Except 2023 rather than 2019)
 https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Warning-1909-Could-not-create-Shortcut-Inventor-Electrical-Project-2019-Ink.html
 &quot;Warning 1909. Could not create Shortcut Inventor Electrical Project 2023.Ink&quot; when launching Inventor
 Any ideas what I can try. So far I&#x27;ve tried fresh uninstall and reinstall.
 Tried these instructions
  
Navigate to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk.
 Locate the folder labeled Inventor Electrical Library 2023.
 Right-click and select properties.
 Clear the Read-Only attributes at the bottom of the box and Apply. 
  
Also tried the master folder and subfolder and gave all users full access to read and write and modify where this shortcut is supposed to possibly be.
 I&#x27;ve also turned off Controlled folder access too via Windows Security. Local admin and network admin both log on.
 Not sure what else to try. Only thing I can think of is that the user domain accounts connect to a network drive and they can&#x27;t access their C:// drives (except admin). But obviously reads all the program data from the C drive.
 I&#x27;m baffled why it doesn&#x27;t happen on every single one though.
 ​
 Any tips for me to try?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Our server was hacked and everything deleted. The hacker wanted money to put it back. Luckily we had a backup file. But how can we make sure something like this never happens again?
 So far we have:
 - Deleted unnecessary user profiles (including the one used for this hack)
 - Banned the hacker&#x27;s IP address
 - Set the server to ban IPs for 24 hours after failed login attempts
 - Made extra backup files stored in multiple locations 
 Firewall was already on.

                              <span>I read this topic (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/x5mlnd/migrate_from_2003_to_2022/) and everything looks ok. Also I have to move DC, DNS, DHCP, print server and file server.
 The difference with me is that I have a mishmash environment. Two domain controllers - 2003 and 2008. The domain level is set to 2003. From 2003 I can not migrate to 2022 directly. But from 2008 already yes? I can&#x27;t find anywhere if after demote old DC 2003 and then upgrading the domain to 2008 I will be able to migrate directly to 2022. Only there is information about the R2 version. On File Services I have option to install Distributed File System and DFS Namespaces, DFS Replication.
 The next question is about the ip number of the new domain controller. I would like to leave the old ip number. That way I wouldn&#x27;t have to change the dns number anywhere.

                              <span>Hi!
 I have a problem and I can&#x60;t figure it out. Here is the ( https://imgur.com/ftNA1qc ) diagram about a part of the network, and the trouble. I have a Windows Server 2012, simple file sharing. When I try to pull the file from the server to the PC from the PC the traffic goes through the router 1, and I dont have a gigabit over the router, but when I copy a file from the Win Server to the PC it goes normally only through the Switch 1 with gigabit speeed. I don&#x60;t get it why it is going through the router? Same subnet ...
 Where should I start to trouble shoot? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 I need to upgrade a cluster from vSphere 6.7 to 7.0. The VCSA is already on 7.0. HA is currently activated.
 ​
 What is the best order for the upgrade? Would you attach the new ISO baseline to one host, then to the next one, etc. or to the cluster and remediate one after the other?
 ​
 Would you fully disable HA, or only do maintenance of single hosts?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

 We have a client who is currently hybrid with AAD Connect. They want to keep their AAD Connect to keep ADDS as the authoritative. Is this a supported configuration with moving away from Hybrid?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We have had a long running issue regarding Sophos XG Firewall. Users who log in to their laptops have access to the internet, and then when some lock their computers and come back to it, the heartbeats aren&#x27;t sent to the firewall and they&#x27;re blocked from accessing the internet until they restart the laptop.
 We have a 3rd party who provide the equipment for us and &quot;manages&quot; them, and we&#x27;ve been on at them for 18 months about this issue. Their response tends to be to run a piece of software that pulls the logs from the machine which is then sent to Sophos. We&#x27;ve done this for so long with no real solution to the issue. I get the feeling the issue is with Sophos as they don&#x27;t know (or care) why this is happening, so things are just stuck.
 I&#x27;ve been asked by my boss to find an alternative to Sophos XG Firewall, as a number of users are losing chunks of the day from having to restart their computers to get back on to the internet. The firewall must be user aware, so that we can apply specific rules to these users. 
 Can anyone suggest an alternative? One with good support would be advantageous.

                              <span>We have multiple IDRACs which are listed by their IP address in the &#x27;Name&#x27; column in OME. I compared settings (DNS, IP, Hostname, custom setting) between a working and non-working IDRAC and they are equal. I already deleted the device and did a rediscover, I changed the OME Console preference from DNS to NetBios. All without success. 
 I found some Dell threads with people having the same issue, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a clear answer to me. 
 Anyone can help me out?

                              <span>Hey all!
 We&#x27;re experiencing an issue with some of the bigger call queue&#x27;s we have. We use Ringcentral integrated with Teams.
 The call queue is set on simultaneously
 When there is a member of the call queue out of office the other users will get an incoming call double (because of the Teams forward I think?). But when 2 users pick up at the same time, the caller is lost.
 Any one has an idea what&#x27;s going wrong here?

 I am currently using CIS Benchmark and it somehow breaks the system. Is there any option i can add to the command line so it only checks for miscofigurations rather than making changes to the system?

                              <span>Hey Guys
 What does everyone use for their &quot;what&#x27;s your computer name script&quot;
 I have used BG info in the past, but users don&#x27;t like it. Rainmeter was used in a past life but that was configured by the company that built the SOE at the time and looked way to complicated
 Looking for something easy. EG they double click on it, pops up a html page with the info. EG Computername, IP address etc
 ​
 Before we would stick a sticker and choose the name in SCCM during the build.
 But now with Intune and Autopilot you can&#x27;t do it and we can&#x27;t be bothered changing it in Intune as we would have to login to the computer etc. and that&#x27;s annoying and broke Azure AD once on the machine. I don&#x27;t mind if they are random but want to be able to get the name easy for the end user so we can connect using Spalshtop.

One of the users was nervous because he’s currently enabled with IMAP and uses Outlook from his gmail account. The worry is, he organized folders and sub folders on his outlook already… will this user lose his folder structure after the migration to m365? 
 Note I will be utilizing bittitan for the migration. Thanks!

 ipconfig /registerdns
 net stop/start netlogon 
 I&#x27;ve tried recreating AD and removing and readding it as well as DNS.
 ​
 I&#x27;m thinking of just rebuilding the server from scratch if i cant figure this out

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I am looking for help/suggestions on a cisco design topology. I have a project where I&#x27;m moving data between sites that are geographically distant. I want redundancy within this system that will be using cellular as its backbone.
 I have visited the locations and completed cellular audits of the signal, bandwidth, etc. Were happy with the speeds and it appears for the most part connectivity shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. But we cannot have tons of reliability issues. So redundancy is important.
 I have IR1101 cellular routers at my disposal. I have attached a drawing to show this topology.
 My questions is:
 How do I steer traffic to use one cellular connection as primary and when this connection fails use the other cellular connection? Policy based routing? if so, can you expand on how this actually works and maybe link something I can gather more information on the config its self. I am a working Network engineer but I have not done this specific config before. Funny enough, cisco makes this 100x harder than all other manufactures. Also costs 4x. But I have the routers so that&#x27;s what were running with.
 Key Notes:
 Cellular SIMs are Private static routable IPS. These are not accessible from anywhere outside of this Private subnet provided by carriers. Meaning The VZW sims can talk to one another, and the ATTs can. But not between the two carriers. In addition these SIMs cannot reach the internet. Internet cannot reach them. (this is a paid service from the providers)
 I am starting with simple site-to-site VPN tunnels. redundant setup. Tunnel 1 between VZW sims. Tunnel 2 ATT SIMs.
 With this setup, I figure all I need is to tell the router. &quot;Hey always use VZW Cell interface, if it fails, go out ATT interface.&quot; Since both cellular connections are live, and they both have tunnels. The failover is simply switching the interface the traffic is going out.

                              <span>hi guys!
 i just switched back to an iphone and got a big surprise ... none of the wifi scan app works
 after a little digging it seems apple blocked access to the metrics needed by thoses apps
 ​
 ive seen some post about the WiPry 2500x but the device cost 900$ ... might aswell keep an android in my backpack for that price ....
 is it possible to use other adapters like Alfa cards ? ore any other external device i could use for that purpose
 i already have a Netool.io so i can still perform network discovery and pcap etc... i only need a solution to monitor WiFi RSSI and see channels

                              <span>Running a pair of 5505&#x27;s in active \standby mode connected to a 4500 core. Everything looks correct and will fail over to standby and fail back with no issue. Problem is when failover occurs. The inside interface is no longer passing internet traffic. I can ping the inside interface from the inside network but now internet traffic is allowed. I have been working with TAC forever and 4500 switch tack blames firewall, firewall tac blames switch. Because of the way the firewall fails over and keeps the same IP address but on the other firewall makes me think there is something with ARP table that is not allowing the IP to change for that MAC address. I am looking for any ideas. We are a manufacturing 24/7 so I can not just reboot the 4500. I have performed forced redundancy failures and it is not specific to which switch is the supervisor.

 ​
 After a long journey, I was able to regain control of six /24 IP blocks that my organization purchased back in 1992. I then put a few of these IP blocks to use, but have ran into a snag. Apparently, since these blocks have never been used on the outside internet, they were listed on the SPAMHAUS PBL. 
 The only information SPAMHAUS lists is the following:
  
Removal procedure 
 Removal of IP addresses within this range from the PBL is not allowed by the netblock owner&#x27;s policy.
  
The bolded is frustrating as I am functionally the netblock owner, yet I see no option for submitting a removal request anywhere. 
 My idea is to put in a ticket with ARIN and with Lumen(whom is our ISP), but wanted to know if anyone else had any tips or ideas?
 Thanks in advance!

 Switch 1: 
 Vrf mgmt1 
 Vlan 10 and a ve on that with ip 172.16.1.1/29 and in vrf mgmt1
 Switch 2:
 Vrf mgmt2
 Vlan 10 and a ve with ip 172.16.1.2/29 in vrf mgmt2
 Vlan 20 and a ve with 172.16.2.1/24
 Now the problem is vlan 20 dosnt always have a active link in it. When all the eth links in the vlan are down the 172.16.2.1 network stops being advertised and disappears from all routing tables. How can i keep it propagating with no links up?

Both sites are set up with a router configured for GRE using a Loopback interface as the source and destination at each end. However, I am not seeing the traffic from my A end routing over to the B end ASA via the IPSEC tunnel. 
 The IPSEC tunnel is policy-based using a crypto map and an ACL defining the interesting traffic to be the Site A Loopback IP going to the Site B loopback IP. And NAT statements are in place for that traffic. 
 Is there something I am missing? 
 Is there any

                              <span>I&#x27;m having some issues getting communication across one subnet in my network. I&#x27;m running a 10.0.0.0/26 net which has my access points on it. I have the control software running on a 10.0.3.0/26 net. I can ping the APs on the .0.0 net but 80 &amp; 443 (as well as probably the ports for AP communications) seems to be blocked. I have various web servers running on another 172.16.2.0/24 net that I can connect to just fine over 80 and 443. I don&#x27;t have any port forwarding rules set up or such. Running the latest version of Untangle as the router and using a Ubiquity switch in between. Haven&#x27;t had the issue with any other nets. Tried to specifically set a port forward rule and still didn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to help advise a friend, and would really value some guidance on how best to approach.
 This is a commercial space, with a suspended ceiling (concrete, with a 1-1.5m gap, then metal grid with gyprock). Here are some photos:
 https://i.imgur.com/u7NDv7G.jpg
 https://i.imgur.com/ethejqo.jpg
 https://i.imgur.com/HdHXRJp.jpg
 I noticed a few things with the existing cabling that seemed a bit strange.
  
Most of the cable is loose-laid over the ceiling grid.
 Some cables is zip-tied to threaded rods, that are used for the HVAC ducting (which I assume is somewhat better, right?).
 Several open plastic takeaway containers of liquid - not sure what it is? Maybe leaks?
 Several pieces of old clothing/rags up there - I assume from construction, or somebody left their overalls?
 Exposed electrical wiring
  
Firstly, does anybody know of any photos of a *good* data cabling setup in a suspended ceiling? (So I can show them what it should ideally look like).
 The closest I could find are these - but they don&#x27;t really show the final complete setup:
 https://i.imgur.com/pRtuEgN.jpg (Source)
 https://i.imgur.com/DhnwC2P.png (Source / Source)
 Secondly, what&#x27;s a way to describe to a non-technical person, why the above are issues? Or why it might cause issues when they try to add new cabling etc?

                              <span>First let me preface this with I have very limited networking experience, but I am at my wits end with a recurring issue that feels like no one else wants to figure out so I&#x27;ll learn how to. hopefully. 
 With this out the way, periodically (always during core business hours) we have really bad network performance, dropping packets from site to external, from site to data centre. But performance inside the data centre to internal devices is fine which leads me to believe that something on site is doing something to an external entity. 
 To give you some idea, we have site connected to a data centre via fibre and then from that data centre firewall out to the internet. 
 I don&#x27;t even know really where to begin with this, the only evidence of the issue is poor network performance, packets being dropped to servers in the DC and to the internet. Im hoping to be able to at least figure out where the traffic is being sent to and or from and from ether i can then figure out what and why and ultimately how to deal with this. 
 I apologise if this is not the kind of post you folks accept here.
 Thanks for reading

 Hope all is well
 I wish if anyone has worked with AT&amp;T and can help please do as I have been struggling since weeks.
 I have a connection to AT&amp;T with public IP address subnet assignment (/29) which I need to use statically on the FW in order to be able to establish an IPSEC tunnel to another location. 
 Juniper SRX -- Modem -- Internet
 The issue am having is am not able to ping from the FW (Edge device) to the Internet nor to the modem IP address.
 I have read through what so called IP passthrough and tried several setups with no luck.
 The modem type is : BGW320-505
 Any advice would be appreciated.

I am fairly new at my job where we mostly cater to Enterprise Customers - I have been supporting SMB customers in my previous job for the last 7 years - I am quite overwhelmed by some of the discussions and I am making efforts to really study especially the fundamentals to have a good understanding.. I&#x27;d like to take some advice from the people here in terms of what would be a good start in learning Network Design Fundamentals? Enterprise Networking to be specific, are there recommended trainings in Udemy, Linkedin, etc. that discuss Network Design and how to build a good and reliable design and understand its data flow as well. 
 Thank you.

                              <span>I am aware that a network professional should plan a site and choose appliances and brands depending on several factors, such as:
  
Reputation and Reliability: A brand with a good reputation for quality and reliability is likely to be preferred by a network engineer. This is because they need to ensure that the network is up and running smoothly at all times, and any downtime or failure could result in significant losses for the organization.
 Compatibility and Integration: A network engineer may choose a brand that integrates well with other devices already in use in the network. This can simplify network management and reduce the likelihood of compatibility issues.
 Features and Functionality: Different brands offer different features and functionality, and a network engineer may choose a brand based on the specific needs of their organization. For example, a brand that offers advanced security features may be preferred for a network that handles sensitive data.
 Cost: The cost of networking devices can vary significantly between brands, and a network engineer may need to balance the cost with the needs of the organization. In some cases, a more expensive brand may be preferred if it offers better performance or reliability, while in other cases, a more affordable brand may be preferred if cost is a primary concern.
  
Having said so, for our next school site (900 users) we could opt to continue using Ubiquiti devices which have an overall good price to performance and reliability ratio. However, within the community, there are several experts who keep on snubbing Ubiquiti as if it were an unreliable or less-enterprise grade devices.
 Given the the above brands, and the above thoughts, if you were asked &quot;Ubiquiti, why yes and why no&quot;, how would you reply? What is Ubiquiti missing compared to the other two brands, apart from a poor support, which is essentially community based?

                              <span>As the title says. I am trying to build a route-based VPN between an ASA and a NSX-V. If this might be better suited for r/cisco then feel free to let me know. The ASA 5515 is current NAT&#x27;d behind another firewall. Ports 4500, 500, and 50 are DNAT&#x27;d to the ASA. This is where my knowledge of networking starts to fizzle out as I believe a lot of the issues I am running into are because of NAT-T and potential limitations I might not know of or how to get around
 The NSX-V is connected directly with a public IP. I am connecting the on-site ASA to the cloud hosts NSX-V. In the snippets below the 216. is the NSX-V and the 10. is the ASA. All Phase 1 settings match and what is interesting is that if make a change to the tunnel on the NSX-V and save (like disabling and re-enabling PFS) the tunnel acts like it comes up on port 500.
  6 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 302015 10.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 216.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 Built outbound UDP connection 9147 for Outbound:216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) to identity:10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) 
 However after about ~30s I get this error and the tunnel continues to loop on port 4500
 4 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 750003 Local:10.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Remote:216.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Username:216.xxx.xxx.xxx IKEv2 Negotiation aborted due to ERROR: Auth exchange failed 
 I saw in this VMware article that states potential issues with NSX-T and IPsec with NAT-T. So I would assume that same behavior is to be expected with NSX-V. I configured the NSX-V to only be a IKE Responder so that only the ASA would initiate the tunnel but I havent seen any change in outcome. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77288
 As a test I tried to build a policy-based IPsec tunnel to a USG I get somewhat similar behavior where Phase 1 completed however after that the tunnel is torn down and the reason being User-Requested. 
 Just a little stumped, if anyone wants to toss some knowledge into my beggars cup. It would be much appreciated :)

                              <span>Hi Folks !
 I&#x27;ve been studying Spine-Leaf/Clos networking design for cloud native data centers for quite some time. Now is time to put the hands onto work !
 Where I live (Brasil), we do have few options when it comes to good equipments and fair prices. Mainly white box ones, being QuantaMesh and Arista the closest (EdgeCore models available are not ONIE compatible, so ...).
 So, for our case, based on price capabilities, we have the following models to be purchased :
  
Arista 7050QX-32
 QuantaMesh T1048-LB9A
 Nexus 2048T
 Nexus 3000 (3048TP) and 5000 (5596T)
  
The preference is for white box switches, and only Arista fits that requirement (we&#x27;re evaluating SONiC and Stratum primarily). QuantaMesh has models that does, but 10048-LB9A seems to not be compliant and doesn&#x27;t support ONIE.

 I happen to get my hands on an &quot;old&quot; Linkrunner Pro, which theoretically has the ability to generate Reports on a PC. However it requires the Software &quot;Linkrunner Connect&quot; which was supplied via CD-Rom- which after all those years- is lost by the previous owner.
 ​
 Do you guys have any hints, on how to connect? Will the newer LinkWare connect with this device,?
 ​
 Any help would be highly apreciated

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a reorganization of a relatively small data center into something resembling a decently designed, modular network. It&#x27;s of a size where it doesn&#x27;t need anything more than a collapsed core with ToR switches acting as a access. It&#x27;s going to be L2 access for now because of equipment availability. Also because of its small size, I&#x27;m not doing any overlay networking.
 However, some of the hosts are VMhosts like ESXi and it occurs to me that they have their, virtual switches internally. Other than providing basic VLAN infrastructure, they aren&#x27;t doing anything in terms of service provisioning, port density is a nonsensical concept for a vSwitch, and any interconnect to physical switches is, at most, going to be doing basic trunking/tagging.
 So, how do these fit into the outline of the infrastructure? I&#x27;m trying to get this design to be scalable -- small right, but possible to grow and evolve without major rip and replace of the whole thing rather than piece by piece over the years -- and data center networking is something I&#x27;m not deeply familiar with. Do you just ignore their presence, beyond ensuring there is no possibility of them causing L2 issues?

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 I’ve got this odd issue the with the VMware sdwan / Velocloud Edge 510-LTE. I have about 150 and randomly they drop their LTE interface. It’s just not there. The debug thinks so too. A reboot doesn’t fix, firmware upgrade doesn’t fix. I have to pull the power for a bit and reconnect to resolve. Across my fleet I’ve got usually about 5 with this issue. The SP can’t work it out and VMware’s reply is it’s not a priority so they get to it one day.
 Curious if anyone seen this ? I though initially heat related but I’ve demonstrated it’s isn’t. 
 Cheers 
 Matt

 I’m selling it for half it’s price, any party interested hit me up, or if you know where can I sell this kind of used equipment I’ll appreciate the tip.
 This community doesn’t let me upload images, but it has 7 total slots and it’s full set up not just the chassis.

                              <span>Hola Amigos!
 I have recently been bumped into an Admin role and I&#x27;m still learning while working. 
 Our department will start a rollout project where the team needs to replicate the AD group memberships of one device(lets call it OLD) to another(NEW device).
 As the rollout team will be replacing an OLD device and provide the End User with a NEW one, they want to mass replicate the memberships as they will be targeting to replace about 15-20 devices a day. 
 I currently have a PowerShell Script that can perform this task but can only do 1-1. I also tried making a script(using google) that can perform this task but for bulk using a csv but I have not succeeded yet. 
 Could anyone please help me with this or tell me about a solution that they use regarding this task? 
 Cheers!

 UNI &#x3D; University (College)
 I am in need of advice. Small office shop here, 40 staff.
 We are getting a new staff member starting soon but they are a permanent remote worker, about 2 hour drive away from the office. (I can visit them in person if it is required)
 The issue is this new staff member will be working out of their UNI dorm.... off UNI provided wifi.... which is the same network as every other UNI student, dorm, cat and bloody dog. In the beginning of the year one of our biggest Universities in our region had a ransomware event and it still is not fully operational, this whole situation makes my spider senses tingle.
 Issue:How the hell am I meant to secure that computer? We have MDM, GPO&#x27;s, antivirus etc but usually you have a private network bet…</span>

                              <span>TLDR; current infrastructure is not fit for purpose - implemented by a predecessor.
 I have been asked to design a new super duper infrastructure fit for the business needs - great that&#x27;s something interesting to sink my teeth into.
 ....to then be told OTR that no matter how good my design is that this project will be farmed out to a consultancy to do the design for us - seems like a great use of my time.

                              <span>So, looking for advice on if this will work
 Have a public website with domain, currently using two nameservers at the registrar.
 Those NS&#x27;s are hosted by the same company, and if that company has an outage, none of my (A), (CNAME), (TXT) or (SRV) records are going to resolve.
 My thought is to setup a Hurricane Electric free DNS account at and add just two of their name servers as the third and fourth entry:
 ns1.he.net
 ns2.he.net
 T so if a lookup is made for any of the records during an outage of the first two NS, it will (FAIL), (FAIL), (RESOLVE he.net DNS).
 Now I don&#x27;t mind keeping the two DNS server entries up to date manually, there are like 10-15 records in total. But does anyone see any issue doing this that I am not thinking about?

                              <span>I swear I&#x27;m at my wit&#x27;s end with this issue, hoping someone can provide some insight: 
 We finally configured DMARC for our domain about a week ago. Everything was functioning fine, reports were coming in correctly, and then we decided to change the email we were receiving reports at to better filter them. Since then, emails to some domains (not all) are bouncing with &quot;554 5.7.5 Permanent error evaluating DMARC policy&quot;. 
 All our records are checking correctly with spf/dkim/dmarc checkers, and all the records have propagated out correctly.
 DNS host says check with your email provider (Google), Google says &quot;your records look fine, turn off DMARC or reach out to every domain you&#x27;re getting that error from and ask their IT to add you to a whitelist&quot;
 Is that the answer? Are we doing DMARC wrong? Our current record is just &quot;v&#x3D;DMARC1;p&#x3D;none;rua&#x3D;mailto:dmarc@ourdomain.com&quot;, still getting bounces.

                              <span>Small business network, 7 public facing web servers. Mostly IIS but several servers are running various versions of Linux.
 To this point the Network Administrator has had the responsibility of purchasing and managing the SSL certificates on the Internet domain registrar. No issue there.
 Previously, the Network Administrator stood up the base server, and the WebDev installed the Internet Web service. The Network Admin would download the appropriate Cert and private key and make it available to WebDev
 New people have come onboard as WebDev, and they seem to have the attitude that it is the Network Administrator&#x27;s job to maintain the certs on the various servers.
 QUESTION: Whose responsibility is it to install and maintain the certificates on the Internet Web servers? 
 A) Is is WebDev that installed and programmed the web server, or is it the
 B) Network Administrator who has been purchasing and managing the SSL certificates on the Internet domain registrar?
 EDITED TO ADD: Currently there are no set policies. The responses to this question will help determine a course of action to take in a Monday afternoon meeting. Thank you!

 I&#x27;ve been getting so many of these every day. Right now my fail2ban has 100+ ips in a banlist.
 A lot of the IPs are from Iran, and it seems the URIs they&#x27;re requesting is some kind of video stream? I thought it was advertising / accesslog spamming, but I looked up the hostname (sal5660.online) and there appears no record of the domain existing.
 IPs come from mobile providers as well.
 Was my server IP previously some kind of botnet C&amp;C or something?

 What i have tried so far but failed to solve the issue:
  
Get user profile (v2) 
 Turned on form setting to people in my organisation and record name option.

                              <span>I purchased an older switch off of ebay in order to upgrade my internet network at my home. I know enough to be dangerous, but I&#x27;m running into issues setting this up in my home network. 
 For my main controller, I&#x27;m running an Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro at 192.168.1.1. I have a few other subnets off of that, but this one for this switch is 192.168.4.0/24.
 I set the ip address of the switch as 192.168.4.2 255.255.255.0
 I set the default router of the switch to 192.168.4.1
 I then setup the dhcp-server pool...
 ip dhcp-server enable ip dhcp-server pool home network 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 excluded address 192.168.4.1 192.168.4.10 excluded address 192.168.4.100 192.168.4.254 dhcp-default-router 192.168.4.2 dns-server 192.168.1.1 lease 1 0 0 deploy 
 After setting this, I can run &#x60;show ip dhcp-server address-pools&#x60; and it shows me the correct configuration and that I have one active lease for the dhcp server pool, but for whatever reason either i&#x27;m missing something from here or i&#x27;ve done something wrong that just above my scope of knowledge. Either way, i&#x27;m looking for help. 
 Anything you can contribute I would greatly appreciate.

                              <span>During the 2020 lockdowns we got fairly settled with a remote working configuration that involves our remote team using RDP on a thin client of sorts, remotely controlling a remote Windows 11 Pro workstation (via a VPN). We then either use a work smartphone for VOIP calls, or using remote audio redirection via RDP. Remote audio redirection works OK if latency is low (under 30ms), but we now have someone who has over 150ms ping to their remote workstation. Unfortunately this causes VOIP calls to have a LOT of lag (probably about 1000ms latency or more) and is generally not great. Before I send out another smartphone, I wanted to do a little bit of digging to see if there are better remote audio solutions available.
 When doing some research I found that some people were experimenting with to passing through a USB audio device, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to do this on a Windows 11 Pro workstation - I enabled the group policy option for RemoteFX USB passthrough on my client PC but I still can&#x27;t seem to find this as an option.
 Other people have suggested installing VOIP software on the local machine - but having to flip flop between the local and remote environment sounds really annoying.
 The last thing I&#x27;ve discovered is a tool called sound-over-rdp, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any feedback as to whether it&#x27;s a good tool or not. It also is a little bit on the expensive side of things, would rather not drop nearly $3k AUD for 5 users / servers.
 I did also find an open source project called USBIP-Win that allows for USB redirection, but it seems pretty complex. I had a quick look at their github and I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;d solve my issue to be honest.
 Any suggestions on the best practices from here would be greatly appreciated!

Is anyone pushing machines to run windows 11 enterprise? Or not bothering for a couple years? Just wanted your honest feedback. We have a few employees who really wanted W11 and like it. They barley see a difference. Just looking for honest feedback if pushing W11 is good or not. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 ​
 There are a lot of recommendations about the sizing of the windows page file. What I am looking for is the correct placement.
 ​
 We are using SSD disks on storage inside VMWare Environment.
 ​
 My questions are :
 ​
 1- Adding page files to other disks may increase performance up to the maximum ?
 ​
 2- if I put the Windows Page File (Pagefile.sys) on the same disk where database or log files are located. is it correct ?
 ​
 thanks,
 Kind regards,

                              <span>Hi,
 I have 1 email address linked to a custom domain. The domain is hosted on name.com, and the email is hosted via Microsoft365
 I&#x27;m able to send and receive mail from within my outlook client just fine.
 I followed the &quot;Enabling DKIM&quot; guide from learn.microsoft on the following link:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dkim-configure?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide
 Additionally, I also followed the github guide on https://github.com/duocircle/Office365-Setup-DKIM-DMARC-SPF
 By following the guides, I added 2 DNS records for my custom domain, and waited 24h to verify this in the dashboard. After 24h the verification succeeded, and the tool at https://security.microsoft.com/dkimv2 reported that DKIM was set up successfully. 
 However, 48h later, messages received from this email address still report 
 dkim&#x3D;fail (no key for signature) 
 In the header.
 SPF and ARC are both reported as pass.
 I tried to verify the DKIM records via an external tool (https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action&#x3D;dkim), which reports:
  No DKIM Record found 
 Could it be that I need to publish another TXT record with the shape?
 v&#x3D;DKIM1; p&#x3D;76E629F05F70 9EF665853333 EEC3F5ADE69A 2362BECE4065 8267AB2FC3CB 6CBE 
 And if so, does anyone know where to get this kind of information?
 I&#x27;m out of ideas on what to try, to make the DKIM check succeed.

                              <span>I wonder if there is a way to enforce a condition through GPO that if someone want to join PC to domain without Mcafee app being installed in the targeted PC it will prevent them from joining them to domain it&#x27;s like assessment checking if the application exist then it can be joined to domain.
 Other ways AFAIK deploying through SCCM, but I wonder if there are assessment check or conditions before joining to domain or am just dreaming. 
 This task should be performed by our Helpdesk support team but sometimes they tend to forget to install the application manually in the targeted PC. 
 Your insight is much appreciated

                              <span>When you rename a user account in Microsoft 365 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/change-a-user-name-and-email-address?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide), there seems to be some consistency problems for the end user and their local device profile, even if you rename their profile, or disconnect their device from the AzureAD domain and rejoin the AzureAD domain. 
 Example: I rename Ben Dover to June Doe.
 When the user logins in to their existing Windows device (AzureAD joined) with their new email address (ben.dover@domayn.co), the first thing Windows does is show a their old name (Ben Dover). Then if they click on the Start button, their profle icon (for Sign Out, Lock etc), shows their old name too.
 Even if you rename their user profile folder and the relevant registry key (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/user-profiles-and-logon/renaming-user-account-not-change-profile-path) the same symtons exist. 
 Anyone else experiencing this and know a way to resolve it?

                              <span>Is there a free or open source software like bitlocker where a laptop locks, you enter your name and customized location every shift to unlock it and then when you reconnect the laptop back to the internet it will send a report back to the people who need to see it? 
 We have an issue where staff is essentially stashing and claiming laptops and leaving none for the next shift. 
 So even if a software like this doesn&#x27;t exist I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;ll be pretty easy to make one but figured I&#x27;d ask here first

                              <span>Some valuable words of wisdom I&#x27;ve picked up over the years:
 The cost of doing upgrades don&#x27;t go away if you ignore them, they accumulate... with interest
 In terms of document management, all roads eventually lead to Sharepoint... and nobody likes Sharepoint
 The Sunk Costs Fallacy is a real thing, sometimes the best and most cost effective way to fix a broken solution is to start over.
 Making your own application in house to &quot;save a few bucks on licensing&quot; is a sure fire way to cost your company a lot more than just buying the damn software in the long run. If anyone mentions they can do it in MS access, run.
 Backup everything, even things that seem insignificant. Backups will save your ass
 When it comes to Virtualization your storage is the one thing that you should never cheap out on... and since it&#x27;s usually the most expensive part it becomes the first thing customers will try to cheap out on.
 There is no shortage of qualified IT people, there is a shortage of companies willing to pay what they are worth.
 If there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way to OpEx it
 The guy on the team that management doesn&#x27;t like that&#x27;s always warning that &quot;Volcano Day is coming&quot; is usually right
 No one in the industry really knows what they are doing, our industry is only a few decades old. Their are IT people about to retire today that were 18-20 when the Apple iie was a new thing. The practical internet is only around 25 years old. We&#x27;re all just making this up as we go, and it&#x27;s no wonder everything we work with is crap. We haven&#x27;t had enough time yet to make any of this work properly.

                              <span>We had an old windows 2012 physical production server failed a few weeks ago. We had DB and file backups for that server. So, we ended up rebuilding the server from the backups. But it still caused a lot of impact, like almost 2 days of production down, and missing a few days of data. 
 After that incident, the boss ordered us to convert all physical servers to Virtual server. We still have a handful of old physical 2012 mission critical running. We use hyper-v for our VMs. Converting is easy, but expecting doing it on the weekend to minimize business downtime. We don&#x27;t have a lifecycle for servers, if they are not EOl and still running, we just let them run.
 Most of those physical servers are old ,I think a better approach is creating new server and letting the application owner migrate the data out!

                              <span>Hi everyone. I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 laptop (Win11 Home) that recently had its motherboard replaced through repair. There was no option for me to suspend Bitlocker as the Windows I have doesn&#x27;t feature that and my laptop stopped working, so I didn&#x27;t prepare for that situation.
 Right now, every time I boot my computer, I am asked to input my Bitlocker recovery key, which is an inconvenience (I have the key backed up). I haven&#x27;t been able to find solutions that match with this situation as most posts online focus on non-repair related issues.
 The Lenovo technician told me this: It&#x27;s because the serial number on the motherboard doesn&#x27;t match with the rest of the laptop. He suggested me that I should reinstall Windows 11, but because it was active when I booted post-repair, I don&#x27;t think this would work.
 I also found out that there&#x27;s a BIOS update, along with some other Windows updates that were there for the three weeks I didn&#x27;t have access to the laptop. But given that the situation I&#x27;m in with the Bitlocker Recovery Key is due to a repair and not a software issue, how should I go about this?
 Thank you in advanced for advice! :)

                              <span>Hey all,
 How do you backup your O365 data? The only reason I can see us restoring is because ransomware, so really I’m wanting to explore what options there are to quickly restore if disaster strikes.
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Check whether your mobile network operator counts ICMP traffic towards your data usage. I discovered that at least one provider (in Germany) excludes ICMP traffic from their data usage calculations, allowing you to purchase the cheapest prepaid plan with the least amount of data per month, set up an ICMP tunnel, and effectively have unlimited data.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know who this may help, but here it goes. If you are in the process of transitioning from IWA (soon to be deprecated) authentication to connect AD groups/users to vSphere to LDAP, there is an issue that you may run into.
 ​
 If you are using an account that is a part of the Protected users group in AD, that account will not work. You will receive an error stating that vSphere cannot contact the LDAP server along with an invalid credentials error. I assure you, there is no connection issue. This is likely the issue. I would suggest creating a separate account and make sure that it is not a part of the Protected users group. This should fix the issue and allow you to connect through LDAP.

                              <span>Hello, hoping one of you fine people have come across this problem with Remote Desktop. Most of the time when I log in to my win10 work pc the screen does this flashing thing as if it was trying to catch up or refresh. I can get around the system while it’s doing this but it’s super slow. It will do this for about a minute each time. Say I walk away and the surface goes to sleep it does the same thing after waking back up and reestablishing the connection. I have a shit ton of stuff up on my desktop so I figured that has something to do with it. If I reboot the work pc it won’t do it for a bit but that’s super annoying with all the stuff I have open. 
 Here’s the weird part - today I was trying on my girlfriends MacBook and the connection was flawless. Soon as I connected it doesn’t even flash once and I can move around the system within seconds. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I’m currently using the staged rollout feature attached to a group for testing 365 authentication through AAD rather than ADFS. That is working perfectly fine and everything works as expected. I’d like to enable that for everyone but unless I’m reading the documentation wrong Microsoft seems to have the end state being the decommissioning of the ADFS server. We still need ADFS for a number of legacy apps but just want to take 365 out. Is there any way to do this other than populating my staged rollout group with the entire company?

 This is barely above minimum wage in the UK. I hope they struggle to hire someone for this role as that&#x27;s an absolute pisstake salary. It&#x27;s crazy being in this community and seeing the salaries of our American counterparts and here in the UK, the pay for IT jobs seem to be getting stomped down regularly for some reason. &quot;Urgently needed&quot; as well, what a joke!

                              <span>It&#x27;s ridiculous that some &quot;sysadmins&quot; here will agree to facility requests, management problems, one-off end-user requests, and all sorts of other BS.
 You are system administrators. Not building administrators. Not user administrators. Not adult babysitters.
 If you can&#x27;t set boundaries for yourself and you say yes to every single request that lands in your office, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time in this field. 
 You&#x27;re in charge of keeping the systems up. That&#x27;s it. If the system is running fine, you&#x27;re researching, optimizing, and upgrading.
 Does the legal team investigate why the TV in the lobby doesn&#x27;t work? Do the accountants change the lightbulbs? Does the sales team find videos for HR policies?
 Quit being the company bitch. Your job is just as hard if not harder than anyone else&#x27;s there. Take some pride in your work.

                              <span>Hello Reddit, 
 I have been working as an sysadmin for 6-7 years and have always been dumbfounded that we have 4-5 WSUS servers, one for each of our customers VM environments that we host. I was told when I started that this was best practice when it was setup but seems like a big fat lie.
 My questions is as follows:
 1) Is it even possible to have 1 WSUS for all the servers for a more seamless environment or is it really best practice how it&#x27;s setup today. Seems like allot of wasted space.
 2) Would the WSUS server need to be on a domain?
 3) Does anyone have any tips what to do?
 Thanks in advance! 👍

                              <span>This is more a topic of curiosity than just hating on the cloud. I myself and very wary of the majority of computing being consolidated to a handful of major cloud providers. I know we here are not going to change the world as decision makers greater than us are driving this change.
 What am I curious is if any company of substantial size reversed their cloud journey. Move thing back to a data center when smart like VMs infrastructure. If so, what drove that reason? 
 My biggest gripe about cloud is the constant flux of change. It is almost impossible to mature what we are doing when the tech evolves rapidly every two years now. Half of Azure features always have a “Preview” tag on it. For me, the lack of stability would be my reason to not become a cloud first company. Not ignore it, but not see it as the answer to all my problems.

                              <span>Looking for a way to uninstall certain components like publisher and access from a current install of windows on several machines silently, and remotely. This would be the equivalent of going to the appwiz and clicking change and unchecking the components that are not needed. I am not looking to completely uninstall the application and reinstalling, which mean a ton of updates to install over again.

 Has anyone had experience doing this? Internet search yields no good results.

                              <span>So I was just talking about this with a friend. I have a small zip file of pictures of my wife and son. Obviously, all pictures are 100% appropriate for work. I like to have those images as a wallpaper as a slide show. So every four hours or so the image changes. 
 My buddy said that&#x27;s a security risk. I am aware of the practice of hiding data inside of images...but if I really wanted to do that I could probably find a way to do that. 
 Personally, I&#x27;ve found those background images to help me especially when your having a bad day. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi Sysadmin,
 So I’ve got a upcoming task at work this week. I need to replace 3 x old APC UPS Units with 3 x new APC UPS Units. I’ve never done something like this before, but it can’t be that difficult, right?
 I’m planning to do this out of hours. I’m thinking, first of all, shut all infrastructure down properly - this includes: 
 Sophos Firewall, User/Server Switches, Physical Servers, Physical Workstations, QNAP NAS Devices, ESXi hosts, Equallogic SANs. 
 Then, power off the current UPS units and unmount them one by one from racks. Remove one old and replace with one new. Connect all power cables as they were before, and power up the UPS’s. 
 Then just a case of confirming everything is back online and working as expected.
 Am I missing something? Anything important to keep in mind with this sort of task?
 I’m excited because these new UPS’s we’ve bought have NICs, so we can setup monitoring/alerts and check on them (if needed) remotely.
 Thanks!

Our business is insurance and smaller clients often have little or no IT security and this is becoming a weekly occurrence.

                              <span>I ran the ForensIT profile migration wizard which migrates an existing profile to a new environment (from domain to workgroup, or vice versa). Doing so deletes encryption keys from Chrome&#x27;s &quot;Local State&quot; file, similar to changing a password, and Chrome lost the saved passwords. When the user logs in from the migrated profile, Local State&#x27;s encryption key is replaced, so tools like Chromepass don&#x27;t work, as it tries to use the new Local State encryption key. They didn&#x27;t login to Google to backup.
 I know the password from the old environment\profile, but switching the profile back still assigns a different SID. Am I screwed without the Local State file? Is there at least a way to find the encryption key? I can then add that to the Local State file and then use the user&#x27;s password to decrypt it.

 Did anyone here ever use it? If so: why? What are the benefits? What are the ways to use it. I am not talking about the vPro/AMT extensions; just raw IME.
 Edit: Just saw that I forget the word &quot;Engine&quot; in the title. Oh well.

                              <span>A couple years ago, the company I was working for was acquired by a much larger corporation. They never said my job was safe, but the people I was working with reassured me my job was going to be safe. Long story short, after a year, I completed a ton of migration work (pretty much everything) but immediately after I was sent on my way. (I don&#x27;t hold a grudge against them, I get it, they had teams to do what I was doing by myself.) I did all the sysadmin work and the netadmin work. We would hit up a trusted MSP if I didn&#x27;t know what to do with the networking side of things. 
 Before the acquisition I was doing everything outside of ERP work. I&#x27;ve been in the sysadmin role for over a decade. Anything Windows that you throw at me I&#x27;m fine with... Some linux i&#x27;m ok with. I&#x27;m pretty good with configuring network equipment, not super advanced. But I&#x27;m comfortable with configuring switches and firewalls. Not an expert, but I can work my way around it. 
 When recruiters hit me up, about 75% of them want some intro level NOC role. Others are trying for a senior networking role. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready for a senior networking role right now, but I think I could be ready within a couple months if given the opportunity. 
 Sorry, I&#x27;m kinda rambling because I&#x27;ve had a few beers and I don&#x27;t know what to do.
 I&#x27;ve had multiple interviews. I&#x27;ve made it known what I&#x27;m looking for compensation wise. So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m outpricing myself. But I&#x27;ve never even been lowballed with an offer. 
 I&#x27;ve gotten interviews but not for every job I&#x27;ve applied for, so maybe my resume is garbage? I just don&#x27;t know what to do.

I took up a new job at a company that sells ERP systems and I have been tasked with securing the client&#x27;s servers. Luckily and kinda unluckily too we run the system on windows servers.
 My superiors are currently adamant on keeping RDP open when the server is public facing so as to make any configuration changes remotely. I suggested to him that this is a very insecure method of operating and that is when he tasked me with coming up with a solution for it.
 Upon some research I came across the following:
  
Change the RDP port to a port outside the well-known ports range. This is cool, but it doesnt solve the problem since the port …</span>

 The past two companies I have worked for barely have servers that you can play around with and if they do, you can only do so much on them because the IT teams either don&#x27;t let you touch certain features because they would break certain processes.

                              <span>Config consists of a MX-01 that has bridge domains for layer 2 connectivity for directly connected devices. MX-01 has an Extended-Vlan-bridge to another MX-02 that has Vlan-vpls encapsulation with the interfaces directly associated to the VPLS routing instance. Which then this VPLS Instance extends the VLANs to the remote sites. MX-02 is a iBGP RR with dynamic tunnels to 10 other sites to create a full mesh. The issue that seems to be happening is the BD is re advertising learned MACs from the remote VPLS sites as its own. Indicating the wrong LSI reachability. And also randomly creating loops with the MAC addresses.
 Is this just the nature of the beast in this setup? Or is there a way to prevent VPLS from readvertising learned mac&#x27;s across the LSI&#x27;s? Or would EVPN be a better fit?

                              <span>I use gateway redundancy on Juniper MX routers based on EVPN, bridge-domains, IRBs with same IP/MAC and ESI-LAG to switches. I have a deployment where it has worked flawlessly for several months already. Some time ago I tried to deploy same design to other site that has several times higher MAC/IP count, specifically around 5k MACs and 30k IPs across many vlans. First problem I ran into, was per-interface MAC and MAC+IP limit in bridge-domains. I figured out how to increase those limits and decided to try again. To better describe what the config looks like, at the bottom of the text there is example of config. The configuration of second router is similar. I did not include BGP with family evpn but EVPN signaling works fine, I checked that by elected designated-forwarder on both routers.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got myself stuck trying to work out how much of our 1Gbps uplinks between switches are being utilised. Our monitoring pulls back input bandwidth and output bandwidth, and our uplinks are fibre with 1Gb SFPs.
 So if the output bandwidth is 100Mbps and the input bandwidth is 100Mbps, then the total bandwidth would be 200Mbps. But because it&#x27;s a fibre pair how does one affect the other? Is there 1Gbps up and down simultaneously or is the bandwidth limited by the SFP?
 Any pointers gratefully received.

                              <span>Hi there, I am overviewing as a consultant a network implementation plan in a school, however I suspect that the property of the school to save on costs has asked the general contractor, who is in charge for designing the infrastructure, to follow a minimalistic approach.
 WIFI access points are for now designed to be in corridors instead that in classrooms! See a frame captured from the building plan: https://i.ibb.co/BghXC0F/Screenshot-79.png
 Don&#x27;t you think this is a bad WIFI design? Can those APs satisfy network requests once the school will run 1:1 devices in each classroom? Will high density APs be required? Walls are basically plasterboard partitions....

Legal approved to start fresh and delete all past data. I noticed that Some stuff in the system is gathering data correctly but other stuff is just showing errors and has wrong configurations. Is there anyway to just blow out the current data on ADAudit Plus and start fresh?

                              <span>Hi all. Wondering what the consensus is with regards to versions of Apache and/or Tomcat that come via a Vendor supplied app or package. That is, software x comes as a product but underneath the hood, it&#x27;s all driven by an Apache backend. Are you handling updates to Apache outside of the vendor or are you having to lean on the vendor to supply an entire new package with inevitably already out of date versions of these packages?

 Some how our C level management got the idea that they wanted to be a company that bases themselves on higher education employees. Our IT manager at the time hired the best fit for the job before this but was strong armed into preferring college graduates. The manager was forced out because he pushed back too much, so they hired a new manager named Simon about six months ago. Simon was a used car salesman until about 8 years ago then he got an IT management degree from a for-profit college. Since then he has spent about a year or two at each job, “cleaning them up” then moving on. He has no technical ambition and thinks a lot of it is stuff you can just pick up.
 On his second day, Simon pulled all of the system and network admins into a meeting (about of u…</span>

                              <span>I got hired in as a System Administrator role in an $100 million revenue Automotive company about 6 months ago... this job is so stressful, and I feel so under qualified. I worked as a mom and pop hardware shop PC repair technician before coming here and was very forthcoming with my skills, knowledge, etc when I interviewed for this role and they hired me.
 It felt like a lucky break and I was so excited to work in a real professional and corporate environment under an IT professional that has been in the biz for almost 30 years. 
 This was not what happened.
 My RM set me down and introduced me to a Team I&#x27;d be working with for support that i needed and they are based in India so I could come to them with any help I need. 3 weeks later, my RM leaves to UAE as well for an indefinite amount of time. Before he leaves, he gives me the most barebones training ive ever received and basically just told me to watch and learn and ill pick up everything i need that way. Every time I need access to something or to help someone out, I have to reach out to someone on my Team in India to grant access, monitor bandwidth, configure DNS, you name it, I pretty much have to ask someone to assist me because either I don&#x27;t have the tools, or the understanding. Maybe it&#x27;s a good thing as I don&#x27;t know exactly what to do with the tools in the first place.
 Is this normal to be hired in like this and feel totally out of place and just constantly questioning if I&#x27;m doing a good job? Are there any tips anyone could give me or maybe empathize a bit?
 Any support is appreciated, 
 Much thanks!

                              <span>In 2020 it was revealed that Finnish psychotherapy clinic Vastaamo had suffered a data breach and patient records of over 30 000 people had been stolen. Many details on this might be interesting to sysadmins. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vastaamo_data_breach)
 Now the case is in court and details about Vastaamo&#x27;s IT systems have been published. Ville Tapio, Ex CEO of Vastaamo is on trial for data protection crime. Suspected hacker has been detained and is being investigated for aggravated data breach, aggravated dissemination of private information, and extortion.

                              <span>Microsoft licensing is obviously confusing as hell and our VAR reps do not seem to have the answers to this question. We do not use O365 (we are on GSuite) but we do want to get Intune working to manage Windows devices. Our main requirements are to get Autopilot working so that we can just mail new users laptops without having to image, use Intune to manage endpoint policies, and use Intune to manage updates (especially feature updates) for older versions of Windows 10.
 When I researched this previously the &quot;EMS E3 (Enterprise Mobility + Security E3&quot; license was supposedly the best option to get all of this. Our VAR seems to think, however, that this does NOT include Autopilot or the ability to push feature updates. Does anyone know if it does or does not? We would likely not use the security features (currently on Crowdstrike) unless it integrates well with our other security products. We are a non-profit so we are hoping we qualify for the non-profit licensing discount but our VAR also thinks that we may not (no idea why they think this). 
 We were also recommended to use this 3rd party site which also makes it seem like EMS E3 does not include Autopilot. However other people have told me that it does and that this site is incorrect.

 edit: This link makes it sound like EMS E3 MIGHT be all we need? But it is not quite clear:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/licensing-requirements
 TLDR: What is the cheapest licensing option to get us Intune + Autopilot + Windows Feature Updates patching ?

                              <span>It has been YEARS since I&#x27;ve setup SNMP from scratch (actually, only in lab 20 years ago) and I&#x27;m getting old.
 SNMP server installation and setup was easy. No problem with the community name, read &amp; read/write, starting the service, etc. But I&#x27;m missing something.
 I want to setup the SNMP service on the network so that we can leverage the native SNMP capabilities in Domotz. I want to get any/all SNMP alerts transmitted via the Domotz client to a distribution group.
 BTW - this network has NEVER seen SNMP. So it&#x27;s a brand new installation.
 But something doesn&#x27;t feel right. I think I&#x27;m missing a step with configuration? Or security? We&#x27;re only starting with SNMPv2 at the moment. I have no idea how to setup v3 yet.
 Any ideas here? Any way to confirm its functionality? Most of the papers I&#x27;ve read have been awful.

                              <span>Microsoft has been encouraging the use of modern authentication for years, yet one of the most common applications in the world, the current version of Adobe Acrobat (Reader included), does not support it. If you try to establish a connection to (business) OneDrive or SharePoint, it&#x27;ll just stall out and do nothing, not even apprising you of the issue.
 That is, unless your 365 tenant still has the SharePoint policy which controls legacy access on &quot;Allow,&quot; then it works fine. But we don&#x27;t and don&#x27;t want to revert that setting just for this.
 Adobe is obviously a major company with the resources to have upgraded their products for this a long time ago--many others already have, including much smaller companies like Foxit. This leads me to wonder if it&#x27;s purposeful: maybe they want you to use the Adobe Cloud instead of SharePoint.
 There&#x27;s a sad little UserVoice entry about this with 8 votes currently (I think more reflective of the obscurity of what the problem is, perhaps combined with many tenants still not going to modern yet, than lack of interest):

 There&#x27;s so many options, most of which either a) have zero documentation, not even system requirements, b) won&#x27;t tell you what it costs until after a demo (that will inevitably be a waste of time with high pressure sales pitches), c) obscenely expensive (with subscription fees), or d) so complicated to set up as to be impossible (see a)).

                              <span>Just had an interview with a company that reached out to me on LinkedIn. It was for a sysadmin position. I get on the interview, and they&#x27;re looking for someone who can:
  
Do T1 Support for all their staff (worldwide)
 Do sysadmin duties like maintain their inventory/MDM
 Build out on-prem infrastructure and networks
 Deal with office facility issues, like changing light bulbs or calling a plumber. Because that makes sense.
 You are on your own, for the most part.
  
I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to say compensation expectations in an interview, but when asked, I gave my range. I thought, surely the pay would be massive to compensate with the laundry list they want this person to do. They came back with, &quot;that&#x27;s pretty high, and a lot more than we envisioned for this role.&quot; Cool, hire someone else then, because that&#x27;s my worth in this position!
 By the way, this is not a small company. I&#x27;d consider this a mid-sized global ~300 person company.
 These hybrid roles that mix several departmental duties on one person are getting way out of hand.

                              <span>For context our offices are western US and the agent is WFH in eastern US. Ex-employee reached out about a month ago with USB issues on his device. No worries there just instructed him to ship the broken laptop back to me once he received the new one I had prepped and shipped to him. Not too difficult
 Well the employee no call no shows his job after the second laptop showed as delivered and his managers are unable to get a hold of him. 
 I instructed finance I believe it to be wise to withhold his final paycheck until we receive our equipment. Sadly finance did not heed this advice maybe due to certain laws I&#x27;m unaware of, But we are now out the two devices and my parent company is telling me I need to follow up and get them back
 How do I proceed with something like this? Is local police an option in this context? 
 Thanks for any advice.

                              <span>Close to me, a company&#x27;s azure admin account was compromised and Microsoft sent them an invoice of 300K+ that only took the perps 4 days to spend. 
 ​
 That makes every azure admin a whale.
 ​
 This is not a post mortem post, instead I want to know how a decent whale organizes his workstation with security in mind, also to endorse/enforce this best practice to his henchmen. 
 ​
 These are the dimensions in that warped space :
  
use multiple VM&#x27;s and RDP into them / use an RDP manager
 you can have multiple Displays
 
you can use the Workspace feature
 you can use RSAT tools / PS remoting
 per RDP session you can configure whether 1 or 2 displays are involved
 some mice have programmable buttons that help you scroll thru Workspaces
 you can use 65&quot; TV screens if you want, IT is not poor where you work 
  
​
 These are the limitations:
 Must use 2 identities: a personal and an admin identity
 The admin account can not have access to Outlook or internet : vsphere/zabbix/jira .. only 
 The bare metal should be a Jumpstation as per MS best practice
 At least one VM for personal Identity, where Outlook lives and for general/genuine Internet work
 ​
 ​
 Challenges
 Many admin task involve cookbooks .. that are online.
 Workspaces are great until you discover that VM&#x27;s you RDP into have workspaces as well. Your programmable mouse gets confused/freezes, forcing you to use the keyboard to &#x27;pop&#x27; into the right level.
 You have to screenshot an error on a VM, but then waste time to find where your Outlook instance lives to get it sent to the ERP people.
 Running wayland on the bare metal for your three monitors isn&#x27;t plug and play, nor is getting portreps working in linux
 You want Teams running as a singleton in your setup, but discover another instance has the camera locked. Or fights with Skype for Business for the dial tone.
 Your employer expects you to multi-task, obviously.
 ​
 ​
 How can it be done ?

 I am finding myself having to be super careful when giving a suggestion or recommending some improvements because some of the more senior members of the team don&#x27;t seem to like it, I feel some of them see it as I&#x27;m trying to challenge their knowledge or the hierarchy. Is there ever a win win situation here?

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m a one-man shop and I&#x27;m supporting an environment with a domain controller on 2012R2. I&#x27;m replacing this device as it is EOL in October, I need some help with best practices and ease of transition/migration.
 I&#x27;m not planning on performing an in place upgrade, I&#x27;m working on getting new hardware and licenses for a fresh install.
 I&#x27;ve read some information about adding the new server / DC to the existing one and then making it the primary and feel like this is the best way to go...however I want to add an additional difficulty into the mix. Currently the domain name is named with a prefix &quot;abc.TLD.com&quot; Since I&#x27;m not doing an an in place upgrade I want to fix this and change the domain name to just the TLD. I&#x27;m also not sure why this was done in the first place, is there any particular reason to do this that I might not be aware of?
 I want to hear your insights from anyone that has had to go through this on what is the best path to take. I&#x27;m primarily concerned with the downtime a new domain will cause as some of the equipment wont know how to find their dependent servers using DNS as well I&#x27;m concerned that permissions will be broken and how to best go about moving over OU&#x27;s and security groups etc.

                              <span>Starting off with the caveat that I am pretty well employed and salaried at the moment. But I&#x27;m far from an entry level position. 
 My frustration comes from my personal email being absolutely flooded with recruiters offering absolutely terrible wages anywhere from $14 to $19 dollars an hour, mostly for helpdesk but on occasion for more specialized/skilled job roles. 
 Or my friends/colleagues/people I meet at conferences/seminars etc who manage larger IT departments than I do complaining about not being able to quality help desk/generic PC support techs. They talk about people talking themselves up in interviews and ending up being completely incompetent. When I ask what they&#x27;re looking to pay it&#x27;s always $16-20 dollars an hour, but inevitably the pay isn&#x27;t up to them but some idiot in HR…</span>

 When trying to &#x27;move&#x27; a call between Mobile and Desktop, the &quot;Join&quot; button on the Teams desktop client does nothing. 
 I am able to move from Desktop to Mobile. This is happening with multiple users and multiple computers in our organization. Teams is updated (1.6.00.1381 (64-bit)) and I&#x27;ve tried to sign-out, and clear cache.
 To be clear, I&#x27;m talking about &quot;Join a Teams meeting on a second device&quot;. Clicking the Join button on the desktop app does nothing.

                              <span>I recently got authorized for a considerable amount of money to invest in our IT department. What should I invest it towards? We are a k-8 school that utilizes Chromebooks, macs, ipads etc. They&#x27;re pushing for STEM programs also. I was thinking of putting it towards some MDM or other monitoring/security programs or even something that would reduce administrative overhead. Any suggestions?
 Edit: we have a little over 200 students using Chromebooks as well as about 30 plus staff that use eye devices or their personal cell phones. They used to use jamf but they stopped using it they were also using netvision but also stopped using that so they&#x27;re going off of Faith at this point and I&#x27;m trying to configure whatever I can through Google workspace which is what they have the devices on.

                              <span>Hello all!
 I just started at a new company and its my first time working with shadow volume copy. Shadow copy is setup and set to go to a different hard drive. We have set limits (screenshot below) but we have one file that is 90.9GB in size and I can&#x27;t figure it out. Does anyone have any ideas of what it could be or where I could look?
 ​
 I also noticed that the big file name is at the end of all the other files.

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello fellow Sysadmins. 
 english isn#t my native Language so keep that in mind &#x3D;) Thanks in advance.
 First some information about the setup: We are using a SRV2019 Standard as an AD/DNS/DHCP Server. Newest updates and so on.
 Recently we had to register a website with a special character (ü) in the domain name field. When i try to resolve the name with nslookup  i get that the domain has not been found : Server failed. When i try the translated XN- adress it works. Is there a way to enable the translation of XN-Adresses(IDNs) ? I&#x27;ve tried to google obviously but the results are very bad. 
 Also when i do a nslookup from my homecomputer (W11) the address is translated to the XN-Adress.

                              <span>Hi everyone. I wanted to share the documentation for a project I&#x27;ve been working on in the school district I work at. If you&#x27;re not familiar with RDS, it basically allows large amounts of users to rdp into a host or hosts that have a shared resource pool, and Guacamole is a browser based RDP server. This will allow us to cut back on computer labs and allow students to use windows based software on their chromebooks. When I set out to make it this way I could not find any clear documentation on how to set this all up and have Azure SAML working so I wrote some up in case anyone else wants to give it a try!

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m little bit out of options with this one. Please advise. 
 The environment:
 Few Windows and Linux servers on the same network, which itself is firewalled, but no firewalls between servers in the network. One downstream WSUS server that&#x27;s keeps Windows servers in the network up to date. No domain or DNS.
 Two of the servers are Windows 2019 SE HYPER-V hosts with few VMs. Let&#x27;s call them HPV01 and HPV02. 
 Apart from the purposes of the VMs and IP addresses, these hosts are identical.
 HPV02 now lost the ability of accessing some shares on the network. There was no change in the configuration. Shares from the server itself are still accessible by others. The error message:
  
Network Error
 Windows cannot access \10.0.0.11
 Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose. 
 Error code: 0x80070035 The network path was not found. 
  
The address is correct, perfectly accessible from all the other servers in the network. Even by the VMs on the affected host. 
 It also lost access to the WSUS share by IP, but it&#x27;s possible to access this share by WSUS server name, even tho there&#x27;s no record in the hosts file. (how?)
 I tried all the possible solutions I could find on the internet. Lot of them for example here.
 Thank you for any advice.

                              <span>Hey guys, I recently installed Zabbix and I am using the Windows Template by Zabbix Agent2. It’s pulling in a lot of info. I mean every single service that’s running. What templates do you use and what are some of the most important things to monitor on let’s say a DC with DNS ? Or a share point server.
 What templates do you use besides the Windows one by Zabbix ?

                              <span>Hi, we are using proxmox, it is an older version, VE 5.4, yes I know it is not supported anymore and we are planning an upgrade soon. We have 3 physical servers in a cluster.
 But we are having an unusual problem with it for some time now. It randomly freezes and nothing can get it back except reboot. Keyboard input, network, VMs, GUI, everything is down. If we connect monitor to the server we can see CLI, but unable to interact with it.
 Error that repeats itself in the logs just before the cluster freezes is: kernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.h:47!
 We did some research and only documented case I can find is from oracle https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/2903057_1.html. But we dont have an oracle account and can not see the article.
 My question is if anyone had the same issue, if yes did you manage to solve the it? Or if it is ok to ask that here if anyone has an oracle account and is willing to send me the info from the article mentioned abovo, of course if there is something of interest for this specific problem in the article. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>This is happening across probably five or six vendors over the last year. Like the title says, if it isn&#x27;t a critical P1 outage, the vendors seem to express zero interest in coming to a resolution for my problem in a timely fashion.
 With currently two of my tools from two different vendors that we are paying good money for, there&#x27;s so many issues that are affecting the usability of the tool that it&#x27;s practically worthless in it&#x27;s current state and we are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a tool that we can&#x27;t use because of issues with it. I have had to reach out to our CSM multiple times for both companies because the support technician keeps on saying that he will get back to me by the end of the day but two days later I haven&#x27;t heard anything. I reach out to the CSM, and then magically within a few hours I have a support engineer beating down my digital door asking when we can schedule a phone call. The phone call takes place, I give them what they need, they say that they will get back to me. 2 days goes by with not a peep from them. Re-engage the CSM, and the cycle repeats. 
 With our firewall vendor, it takes an average of 8 days for a resolution, even the most simple of changes. I&#x27;ve brought this up to management multiple times and they say that we don&#x27;t have the manpower right now to take our firewall duties in house nor do we have the manpower to research and negotiate a contract with a different firewall management company.
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a staffing shortage or just poor management, but this is incredibly frustrating because I have management at my company asking why these issues aren&#x27;t resolved yet and I hate shrugging my shoulders and telling them that I&#x27;m in a perpetual state of waiting for support to get their act together but it&#x27;s the truth.

                              <span>I am dealing with a cert issue on our on prem exchange 2016 server. Our main email domain is different than what was used on-prem also. Newbusinessname.com vs OBN.com (if that makes sense). The cert on the on-prem machine is for the OBN.com and half our users don&#x27;t even have that alias anymore, just the newbusinessname.com as their primary. There are no mailboxes on it, it is just a smtp server at this point or used to create new accounts. Accounts are on-prem by synced to Azure. All email is using Exchange online. First, do I even need this on-prem server? Second, what is the real need of an on-prem server? I am guessing I need it to handle the on-prem accounts email attributes. 
 I am just tired of cert errors and users being prompted for passwords for the old exchange server that just sits there and relays an email every now and then.

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best way to go about recreating Python&#x27;s virtual environment functionality, for a nice fresh Windows install? 
 I&#x27;m looking to create a persistent, separate clone of my installation that can handle its own program installs, config, etc without affecting my &quot;clean&quot; install. 
 If it sounds like I want Windows Sandbox, kind of - but I want it persistent. I know I could make a recovery image of my current windows install, but I&#x27;m trying to AVOID needing to restore to a previous date, and I want to use both &#x27;environments&#x27;. I considered using a VM with an image of my setup, but AFAIK I&#x27;d end up with significantly reduced performance. Lastly, I know SOME applications allow you to install to single users, but some of the tools I need required admin. 
 The end goal is to keep my work tools separate, along with their associates config / dependencies / quirks within Windows; while my &quot;main&quot; environment stays clean and proper. 
 I know very little about Docker, but I wondered if I could put all those apps&amp;dependencies into a container, and run them that way?
 Appreciate any input.

 We’ve recently hired a couple of Helpdesk technicians and looking to document their training needs as well as training that has been provided. 
 Just wondering if anyone has a templated document that they currently use before I start building one. Appreciate every business is different. 
 Just don’t want to re-invent the wheel so to speak. 
 Cheers,

 With the minimum requirement of two redundant connections between the  members.
 I say this means we need thre connections, my colleague say&#x27;s we just need two. 
 Who is correct? There is a Semla-bun at stake.

                              <span>Hello,
 it is me. Again.
 I am lost on this one and hope to find some aid.
 For my organization I have setup an IKEv2 VPN on our firewall. And it seemed to work fine, as my coworkers all use it without problems. But a few days ago one of our users approached me and asked when their problem is &quot;finally solved&quot;.
 Which problem? I wasn&#x27;t aware that there even is a problem.
 We had a few major internet outages three weeks ago, but those were resolved by our ISP. But since then, their VPN connections drop regularly, like every 1-2hours. The users thought, that these two problems were somehow related.
 While windows is still telling them, that the VPN Connection is connected, the firewall already decided to drop the connection, probably because of the DeadPeerDetection.
 I don&#x27;t know who to ask exactly. The firewall is a fortigate. The OS is windows, and the vpn profile is setup in Intune.
 Does anybody have a tip for me? What can cause such a behavior?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;d like to set up centralized Log Management for our Company.
 I&#x27;m kind of new to that topic and thus looking for recommendations...
 What we would like, if possible, to collect Logs from:
 On prem (across VPN connected locations):
 - vSphere Clusters
 - Virtual and physical Windows servers (Server 2016+)
 - Virtual and physical Linux servers (Centos7, Rocky Linux)
 - Various Cisco Networking Devices (can forward to e.g. rsyslog)
 - Possible Windows Clients as well?
 Also we&#x27;re running machines/endpoints/containers on:
 - MS Azure
 - GCP (Google Cloud)
 - OTC (Open Telecom Cloud)
 We&#x27;re monitoring environments (at least part of them so far, WiP) with Icinga2, so integrations to that may be nice as well.
 So far I took a quick glance at Graylog and ELK, they seem to be the most prominent and obvious choices to look at. But I&#x27;m unsure about what of our environment may or may not be supported, so experiences are very welcome.
 Of course, alternatives to the two are as well.
 Thank you! :-)

 At first we&#x27;ve deployed the script using user configuration but it&#x27;s not ideal because it asks an admin prompt. So we&#x27;ve done it using computer configuration but it just doesn&#x27;t want to be deployed.
 Is it a recurring problem scripts that doesn&#x27;t work as GPO? Or is it just us?

                              <span>Does anyone try to make AD mirror their organisations HRIS systems?
 For computer users that&#x27;s easy (already in place) But for non computer users, can an account be created which resembles more of a placeholder or contact?
 I&#x27;d really like our Active Directory to be as closely aligned to HRIS as possible but for all the users who don&#x27;t actually log into a computer this seems not so straightforward.
 Just in case your wondering what some use cases for this crazy ask is....
 I need to add all internal company phone numbers to the global address list and as HRIS is always the source of truth which syncs to AD, it seems logical for the users in the organisation to all appear in AD whether they are a computer user or not.
 Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you as always, wysadmin&#x27;s

                              <span>Hi All, 
 Has anyone been seeing long delays with opening Safe Links re-written in Outlook and Teams?
 Delay can be anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes.
 Started yesterday for our tenant (UK) and still seems to be on-going.
 Opened a support case with Microsoft who initially advised that it was expected but pushed back mentioning that the delay is not normally this long. 
 Have since been told that a sync object repair has been initiated and to wait 24 hours. 
 Obviously I could turn off the safe links policy in the meantime but would rather not if I can help it.

 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

We have users trying to connect to our enterprise network and they often struggle with the settings on Android, so they call our support and this is quite a headache to make them to configure the 802.1x wi-fi on their phones I&#x27;ve tried several parameters from this website : https://jasonmurray.org/posts/2020/wifiqrcode/ Either with the barcode app or the QR-scanner in the system settings but it doesn&#x27;t work. There&#x27;s very few documentation about it, are any of you managed to make valid qr-codes ? Thanks in advance !

 I feel like my manager doesn&#x27;t know how much I contribute! Very busy day to day! On the other hand, another member within the team, I feel like he just play on his phone all day...
 Should I redirect all the requests to my manager and ask the manager to delegate all the tasks and request within our team???

 ​
 anyone know how to the retrieve the product license key for windows server 2016 standard * DELL OEM* version
 ​
 slmgr returns only the last 4 digits or so, and the original license keys docco / sticker is gone.
 ​
 failing that on reinstall will it activate with the already activated license key (given hardware hasn&#x27;t changed)?
 ​
 hope that all makes sense.

 I have looked at:
 - GPO (only default domain policy is applied to everyone)
 - Fine grain password policy (we have none)
 And can&#x27;t figure out why the one user cannot reset their password due to &quot; This password does not meet the length, complexity, age, or history requirements of your corporate password policy.&quot; in SSPR
 They have the same license as everyone else in which they all have no issues resetting their password.
 We have a hybrid AD setup where Azure AD has been setup on an on-prem domain controller connecting to Azure.
 Is there anywhere else I can look at to troubleshoot?

                              <span>We have an older application that was administered by an older, career, administrator. Well, he hit his 30 year mark and retired (to be fair he earned it). 
 We hired a younger system administrator and he assumed administration of a number of services, to include the application mentioned earlier. 
 The vendor of said application no longer exists, but we’ve been able to keep it running on a windows server 2012 R2 (ha remember service packs?!) virtual machine. 
 Well, windows server 2012 R2 is going EOL this year. The young administrator asked what he should do and well no one really had a good answer. So the young admin must have taken a shot of whiskey and said fuck it because before we knew it he had upgraded the server to 2022! And the old application is still up and running as if nothing changed! 
 The young administrator has earned himself all sorts of street cred with this, honestly, ballsy (maybe reckless) move! Us senior admins and engineers all want to fast track him with more responsibility! 
 I told that story because I don’t see that kind of risk taking by junior admins and honestly I kind of loved it!

                              <span>Hello all, 
 So I have a scenario that I’d like some advice on. I have an HP enterprise blade server with a single NIC in it that has two ports. It’s runner Windows Server 2019 with a Hyper V instance that I’d like to Run Untangle on. Now the question is, can I use one port on the NIC as Hyper V’s WAN and the second as a LAN for the internal network that would then be handled by Untangle, or should I just create a scope within Win Server to issue IP’s Via DHCP on the NIC’s second port, or is any of this even possible because I have never attempted it myself. I understand it’s an odd request and it’s more for a Proof of Concept rather than production, but I’m trying to prove a point to a manager that took one network class and now believes themselves and expert. 
 I’m in essence trying to create a network on this blade while getting a DHCP assigned address from the actual production network at work. Running that traffic through untangle to a layer 3 switch/router then out to two Layer 2 switches that will then assign addresses to plugged in devices. It’s a mess admittedly but again this is a proof of concept. 
 I thank anyone who has advice or comments in advance.

                              <span>According to what I know, lower metrics are preferred, but in this case, we have two vEdges routers (MPLS and Internet routers) that are both advertising default routing by using the command &quot;default-info originate,&quot; in OSPF.
 The current problem is that the client claims that there are subnet traversing to MPLS routers, which are meant to traverse through the Internet to reach public servers. Upon checking the configuration. The MPLS metric is set to 50 and the Internet to 1, respectively. Internet should be preferred based on the metric they have. Another thing, there is only one point-to-point connection between each router and the core switch, I am unable to access or control those core switches. (refer to the diagram w/ issue)
 https://ibb.co/hRsGv29
 I&#x27;ve now tried setting the MPLS value to 1 and the Inet value to 50, and apparently they claim it works. Do you believe that this is possible, particularly in multi-homed connections? (refer to the diagram FIXED)

                              <span>We&#x27;re starting the process of transitioning from 5508 WLCs to 9800-L-F WLCs. Our existing 5508s have around 100 APs (all 2700 and 2800 series) connected. I have the new WLCs set up in the same vlan and the plan is to eventually join the two WLC pairs in a mobility group to ease the transfer and eventually install all new 9115 APs but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m asking about today.
 I have the 9800s configured and I have one spare 2702 AP that I&#x27;m trying to get connected to it.
 5508 IP is: 10.1.50.135 (/25)
 9800 IP is: 10.1.50.132 (/25)
 I set up an isolated DHCP server with option 43 set to the IP of the 9800s and made sure the test AP would reach out to this DHCP server for an address. This part is working. The problem is even after a full wipe (format flash:) and reload from scratch, and after seeing a console message that it properly receives the .132 address from the DHCP server, it then reaches out to .135 anyway and I have no idea why.
 Here&#x27;s some selected console output to show what I mean:
 %DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface BVI1 assigned DHCP address 10.1.50.232, mask 255.255.255.128, hostname AP0081.c4fc.d39c %CAPWAP-5-DHCP_OPTION_43: Controller address 10.1.50.132 obtained through DHCP AP has SHA2 MIC certificate - Using SHA2 MIC certificate for DTLS. %CAPWAP-5-DTLSREQSEND: DTLS connection request sent peer_ip: 10.1.50.135 peer_port: 5246 
 This is after a full wipe and reload so I don&#x27;t think there can be any leftover config pointing the AP to .135

                              <span>Hey guys,
 has anyone had experience with Fortigate&#x27;s SSL-VPN in conjunction with a free token alternative? 
 Unfortunately, since it involves a high number of users, the FortiToken is not economical.
 Since I couldn&#x27;t find any other experiences after weeks of research, I&#x27;m still stuck with the following constellation: 
 (free)radius server (with Google Authenticator PAM module) as well as (open)LDAP server, which performs an AD user query.
 Active Directory is not mandatory.
 Greetings!

 I&#x27;m creating the floor plan for a new building in ExtremeCloud IQ. There is a giant refrigerated section of the building that uses metal-coated foam insulated wall panels like this:
 https://www.kingspan.com/us/en/products/controlled-environments/cold-storage-panel-systems/ks-shadowline-interior/
 Does anyone know approximately how many dB loss those typically cause? I only ask because when drawing walls in their tool, they only have selections for concrete (12dB), drywall (3dB), brick, and just common stuff. I just want to know what type of wall would be the best substitute.
 Thanks!

I created VLAN 110 on the core switch at our main site assined to a trunk port interface. The VLAN routes from the core firewall to our 2nd location&#x27;s MPLS router which then reaches the firewall. That&#x27;s where traffic stops. On the switch at the 2nd location I have added the vlan with an ip helper address to point back to our dhcp server at the main site. Everything in the firewall seems to be correct, but for some reason the route isn&#x27;t passing through. Can anyone give me an example of a switch config that might be missing or would be necessary to allow VLAN 110 to pass through?

 I want to know what should be trouble shooting approach here on all the devices in the path how to know where the issue is. Is it on customer onprem where agents are sitting or in mpls by the service provider or is it in network of cloud provider or is it the server in the cloud itself? I&#x27;m blank right now where to begin and what tools to use as a network engineer who isn&#x27;t a voice engineer? I just have to look from the network perspective if the problem is on the network level or not. 
 Please help.

                              <span>Hey all! 
 My team and I are working on a upcoming large/arena scale sized VR experience and some people would like to know what the best or most suggested routers for this setup would be:
  
60&#x27;x80&#x27; total coverage needed
 6 Meta Quest Pros, all using Wifi/Airlink
 6 individual desktops to power each individual headset
  
The headsets need to be able to talk/communicate to each other but do not need internet access, this is a local multiplayer experience. Wifi signal/coverage is extremely important too for quality to remain at the desired level. These are the general questions suggestions we are hoping someone could shed some light on:
  
What routers do we need to buy?
 And how are we doing the connections for each PC to each headset?
 Won’t each PC to headset connection require multiple routers?
 With each PC to VR headset on a separate connection and router?
 And then these routers cannot cover the whole space, so don’t we need a mesh network or wired connections to each of the routers in the ceiling?
  
Any help or recommendations on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Can we log user command activity on Cisco prime or ise?
 I know that we can do it on ise but how long can ise store those logs for? Can it do it for 1 year more than 1 year etc?
 What about prime and which one is the better option for storing logs.
 And when I talk about logs I&#x27;m talking about all commands which a user types into the cli on a switch/router etc.
 We are trying to figure out when some vlans were created on our core as these have no description and no svi associated with them. No Mac addresses associated with them either so thinking on whether to delete them or not but need to know who and when they were created and why.
 We use both prime and ise.
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a hard time finding documentation on how to do this. 
 I&#x27;ll have 10 Mesh APs(MAPs) out in a parking lot and I want to make sure a failure on the Root(RAP) doesn&#x27;t take down the whole mesh.
 I would want to have two RAPs both wired back to a switch.
 How do I accomplish this without taking down the network with a loop? 
 I&#x27;ve seen documentation on ethernet daisy-chaining but I don&#x27;t think that fits this use case. 
 I&#x27;ve other posts that hint that you don&#x27;t need to worry about spanning-tree as each MAP will only use one path back to wired network anyway.

The whole billing to CC is getting out of hand and I&#x27;d like to set them up to be paid like any other vendor(whatever the accounts receivable people do). I have done some digging and it seems like the Starlink communities are full of people who don&#x27;t get why you would not want to be billed via CC for several hundred different connections in a company.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to figure out if there is a way to open a port for a host on the other side of a Policy based IPSec tunnel. The reason I want to do this is because most of my sites sit behind a CGNAT and I&#x27;m not able to open up ports on those sites firewall. Well if I do it would be pretty useless haha
 The current network setup involves OPNSense in Azure as a hub and the sites connect to is so the can reach each other. They also use OPNSense as their firewall as well. 
 My subnets for each network are the following
 Azure: 10.0.0.0/24
 Site A: 10.1.0.0/24
 Site B: 10.2.0.0/24
 Site C: 10.3.0.0/24
 So basically what I&#x27;m trying to figure out is if I have a host on Site A is is possible to open a port on the Azure side of the tunnel and forward the traffic to back to the host on Site A?

                              <span>I have a company laptop that refuses to complete the connection to an updated Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. I&#x27;ve tried all the troubleshooting steps I can, and the adapter works flawlessly with the same hardware but a blank computer so I&#x27;m thinking it must be something about the GP/setup on the domain computers that&#x27;s preventing it from completing the connection.
 When you press win+k it&#x27;ll happily find any miracast screen, but it&#x27;ll try to connect and then fail after about 20 seconds. I tried the troubleshooting steps below but everything seems fine. DXDIAG has it as supported, firewall is setup to allow wireless displays so I&#x27;m at a loss. I had a poke with Event Viewer but I&#x27;m either not looking in the right place or there&#x27;s nothing there that indicates an issue.
 I am not the IT team, they&#x27;re not supporting this and don&#x27;t really know what miracast is and fed back that &#x27;we don&#x27;t support 3rd party apps&#x27; - this is not a 3rd part app so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s been inadvertently blocked due to something else.
 Oddly, it used to work about 3 years ago, then coming back off lockdown it now does not.
 Steps I followed below:

                              <span>Hi all,
 Long time lurker on the sub and just had a few questions. Bit of background of myself, currently a helpdesk guy looking to learn networking to move into a network admin role one day. The other day my boss showed me one of our comms room with a rack of live networking equipment. The rack consisted of multiple Aruba switches/controllers and Cisco router stacked on top of each other.
 My question is how would you go about moving all this equipment to another building? Would it simply be a process of unracking all the equipment and cables --&gt; move equipment to another building --&gt; rerack all the equipment and plug in all the cables?
 Another question is how do you guys keep track of which cables are plugged into which device? I&#x27;ve seen network diagrams before but are there diagrams for which cable goes where?
 My guess would be you would need to save the running configurations on all these devices and take pictures of all the cabling.
 Is there anything else you guys would consider?

                              <span>Hi r/networking!
 This seems to be the place to ask about EVE-NG. I&#x27;m a relatively inexperienced network engineer at a company with a corporate EVE-NG Pro server. Each employee has a username to access it.
 We can see and access each other&#x27;s labs, but when I try to access a device I get presented with a generic bash prompt. Like it&#x27;s allowing me to access the emulator without the device image being present. 
 Is there a way for two users to simultaneously work on a lab together? If so, how do we go about it?

                              <span>So, some background, my company&#x27;s security cameras are connected to a Windows 2016 server. It&#x27;s a new system, and the video quality is extremely choppy and bad. I reached out to the security company&#x27;s helpdesk and they suggested nic teaming 2 of the nics to increase bandwidth. So I added nic 1 and nic 2 to a team along with the settings the help desk suggested. As it&#x27;s adding the nics, it immediately errors out and states Faulted, not found on both nics, then the redundant nics 3 and 4 drop their connections. When I realized that the security camera server had no network, I immediately called a senior analyst over, and then the server became unresponsive. Since it was unresponsive, we rebooted it. It stayed on the &quot;restarting&quot; screen for apx 5 minutes and then blue-screened. Also, before it became unresponsive, I attempted a windows troubleshoot, and it gave me a &quot;drivers&quot; error. What could have caused the server to freak out.

 I&#x27;m posting this here because I find it hilarious. I&#x27;ve brought up the issue in 2 separate phone calls to the company, and 3 separate tickets on their online site. This all started toward the end of the summer of 2021.

                              <span>I just spent 2 hours looking through the internet for the user manual for this KVM&#x27;s manual to find the default username and password. Tons of results for the IP enabled version, as well as some other unit with a K in the model number, but NONE for this EXACT model. Those units have a different default username and password.
 So, I&#x27;m putting this on the internet for posterity. Hopefully Google scrapes this page and no one else is stuck in the same spot as I was. 
 B020-U08-19 Default username &#x3D; BLANK B020-U08-19 Default password &#x3D; BLANK
 RESET THE PASSWORD BY TAKING THE COVER OFF THE KVM AND JUMPING THE PINS LABELLED RESTORE DEFAULT PASSWORD, AS SEEN IN OTHER MANUALS AND VIDEOS. 
 Hope this helps!

                              <span>I work for a university and a professor walked into my office. This professor teaches advanced database courses at this university… he came in, requesting I give SA access to their class’ sql server instance to all his students. I’m like…. Why?
 They need to be able to find out the server name and IP to be able to connect to their database with this third party app.
 I’m like, here is the server name and IP and let me know if they have any issues….
 Chirp chirp….
 Poor students.

                              <span>I have had nothing but problems with Lenovo-branded docking stations. Everything from flickering monitors to the inability to wake up monitors to display ports just stops working. And yes I&#x27;ve tried everything....literally everything. I&#x27;m ready to move on. 
 What have you all had success with?
 I&#x27;ve tested the Plugable brand docks and have had no issues so far (almost a year in service) so I&#x27;m leaning toward that brand. 
 Thanks!

 Is it took much work to highlight the text and copy and paste it, so I can do the same instead of having to type it in by hand from your screenshot into whatever tool I am using to try fix your problem?

                              <span>Trying again as I lost the post I just typed. 
 Why do leavers from a non tech background of the role they work in, think it&#x27;s acceptable in 2023 after they have decided to part ways with the company to demand a leaving &quot;rider&quot;, after they handed the notice in?
 head of business and approvers above this allow it when they know it&#x27;s more work to make a corp device into a personal one. Doing all of the admin alongside to make sure there is no data leak. 
 Then the business describes this year the same old thing we have no budget to invest in new systems, hardware, infrastructure or give bonuses due to the economic world. 
 We work incredibly hard all of us to keep the business running in a stable robust environment to prevent from breaches and other unknowns. I can say that and other IT admins will hopefully respect that. 
 Yet it just feels when you see a leaver asking you about the process of keeping my IT business assets when I leave it&#x27;s like do we owe you that. It&#x27;s not yours. It&#x27;s the businesses. Yes you have a phone number that&#x27;s the businesses line number. Your iPhone the one that says property of XYZ.com is again a business asset. Also the laptop which is a corp laptop with a corp image on it with corp licensing on it is not yours they still seem to think it&#x27;s ok to ask for this when they leave like it&#x27;s a sentimental thing ? 
 Then it comes your manager asks you to make sure they transition you off everything and give them the guidance you should of done this and that. In work hours when you have other actual jobs work related jobs to be doing. 
 Why do businesses not stand up and have a stern stance on this. They have a HR team they have policies and procedures and we chase users for not bringing kit back and holding final salary payment but the odd who dosent want to let go demands they want IT hardware as a parting gift. Opinions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure some of your mess-ups are pretty rough and costly, but....imagine being in the IT department at the place I work. Our servers hiccuped lightly middle of last week, then died completely Friday morning. They have been down ever since then, they were able to partially restore all of the drives that aren&#x27;t needed for the day-to-day work yesterday but the drives we need are still MIA. 
 I&#x27;d estimate the files take up maybe 10TB of space, nightly backups exist.....they are just having one hell of a time restoring them apparently.
 This is a company that does over 100m of revenue a year.

                              <span>I had an interesting discussion with a co-worker today and told him how I was using ChatGPT to help me write/improve some powershell code. He said he would feel a little weird using it for work...like it&#x27;s not his work. I said, &quot;no...just another tool in the arsenal. How long have you been using StackOverflow or google to copy code?&quot; You have to know code to tell it what to do so it&#x27;s not like some dude off the street can explain how to create a complex function in powershell. 
 Anyway, how many other sysadmins have been actively using ChatGPT? What have you primarily used it for at work? And do any of your coworkers know? I&#x27;m a bit reluctant to even mention it to anyone else after that conversation.

                              <span>We have one specific system (laptop) where a user is somehow being added to the Administrators group. 
 We thought the user got the Administrator account password and was adding themselves to the Administrators group. That might not be the case here. 
 The user really isn’t computer savvy. They also haven’t made any changes ever to the system while having Administrator privileges. 
 We did change the Administrator password on that system a few weeks ago. We haven’t touched the system since. It seemed like maybe it was indeed the user making the group change somehow because it stopped for a while. Today, their account popped back into the Administrators group. There is no record of the Administrator account being logged into or used in order to make the group change. They are just magically in the Administrators group again. 
 We originally thought it was something related to the original sysprep of the system because they would get added to the Administrators group at almost every login. That doesn’t seem to be case here since it stopped for a while. We’re thinking it might be some system service or an application they launch that is adding them to the group?
 Any ideas on how to trace this? We’re already using Event Viewer to track the group change being made and confirmed in the GUI that they are indeed in the Administrators group.
 Any other ideas how this is occurring?

                              <span>/rant Based on a true story:
 I was asked to create a NAT and firewall rule set from an external IP to a 3rd party controlled server dead smack in the middle of an important internal subnet.
 I have zero reason to believe anyone has set up comprehensive local device firewalls on the other devices in this subnet.
 I pitched the idea that they either review their individual firewalls, or create a DMZ for their new server, and only allow inside access to the items the 3rd party box &#x27;needs&#x27;.
 NOPE! We&#x27;re going to blast a goddamned hole in the perimeter with no further thought given. I have the proof in email that this is the choice that was made.
 Not only would I like to tell them to make these awful configs themselves, I&#x27;d like to tell them I won&#x27;t help them when they get owned, and they should request someone else.
 What is the point in doing a job badly, and dutifully taking part in bad practices? I can get paid to do shit work in a thousand other places where nobody is experienced or conscientious enough to notice or care. I tried for something better, and now am subject to bad choices by unqualified high ranking functionaries.
 The second something goes wrong, I&#x27;m checking into the E.R. with a fatal case of &#x27;I Told You So&#x27;, and they can find another technician to bail them out.
 Nuts to these clipboard cowboys.

Maybe Microsoft did make this change I didn&#x27;t know but I can&#x27;t seem to locate any documentation reflecting this information that my superior told someone. Did Microsoft change this &quot;behaviour&quot; recently for windows 10/11?
 &quot;This is a ridiculously dumb Microsoft change.
 Shutting down your PC doesn&#x27;t restart your computer. (not intuitive and a behaviour change recently)
 Restart, is the only way to reset and start fresh.
 In effect if you shutdown and turn on your PC every day of the year. It is effectively the same thing as having never restarted your PC for a year. At the end of the day you should hit the &#x27;Restart&#x27; button instead of shutting it down.&quot;

 Putting aside the pieces on it blocking ads as a revenue source for things like Youtube, is there any security risk in using them? Or it all a benefit from helping to block the rise in malwaretising?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll share as much detail as possible as this problem hasn&#x27;t waivered. Keep in mind this is my first step up from IT specialist to sys admin so bear with me OGs.
 We are operating on a 2016 Windows Server and this holds all of our drives. The business is about 100 people. In November, I installed the .NET Framework 4.8(KB5020614) and the Update for Windows Server 2016(KB5019964). I have had non-stop issues with connectivity to the drives ever since. The errors string from &quot;local device name is already in use,&quot; to &quot;Target name is incorrect.&quot;
 I have found limited success in doing ipconfig/release-renew-flushdns. It&#x27;s usually a 50-50 chance that the issue resolves after that. If I use the IP address to the server in the file explorer address bar, it immediately pulls up; its the complete opposite when I try to call it by its name \\server1\. I&#x27;ve checked the DNS and DHCP to see if they&#x27;re properly communicating and there seems to be nothing wrong(not ruling them out).
 As recent as yesterday, I have started to force our user computers to use a different IP through the IPv4 in adapter options. For instance, I&#x27;ll make 192.168.8.113 go to 192.168.8.204. I have found complete success with this and the most odd part is I can set the user machine back to automatically grabbing an IP address which will revert it to 192.168.8.113 and it instantly works. 
 It seems like I&#x27;m forcing the previous session to end and renewing the lease on the DHCP ??? I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m open to all suggestions as my boss(the owner) grows in irritation. 
 Thanks ahead of time.

                              <span>Hi all, Company pretty lax in terms of its approach to BYOD.
 Something that i want to fix. I need to determine which users are utilising BYOD and how they are doing it to work out a plan of action.
 We use O365 and have DUO+Okta.
 Ideally, i would like a report of some description that shows logins from non-corporate devices.
 DUO reports do not give me the hostname of the device the user is logging in from, and i dont believe Azure logins do either. 
 In an ideal world i would just turn on the posture settings of DUO and see who screams, but that isnt going to go down well.
 I need to demonstrate the scale of this to upper management so they realise how many people do this and realise the exposure we have with data on personal devices etc etc. 
 Can anyone think of a good way to determine which devices logins to O365/DUO/Okta are coming from?
 Was thinking whether the install log from O365 apps gives telemetry of the device its installed on?

                              <span>Hello! I have a question regarding following topic/usecase. 
 We have here a classic on-prem Environement with a hyper-V cluster and mainly Windows Servers in Production. Now we have a new system that will run &quot;dockerized&quot;, that environement is a composition of 7-8 containers that run together to deliver that service (mysql, redis, nginx and some other images).
 How do you deal with that &quot;in general&quot; regarding the management of such stuff?
 Do you create a bunch of linux hosts virtualised inside hyper-V and manage them with some container orchestrator (any tips - can be commercially backed and cost something)? So, something like a virtualized cluster?
 Do you build something completely &quot;aside&quot; like a bunch of synlogy nas with docker support? or even a complete new hardware cluster?
 Using windows servers for docker stuff does not make sense imho. 
 Thanks for any recommendation :)

 I support about 200 users in one company but need to support about 100 in other companies. I had been using real VNC but the customers hate it because I&#x27;m not on their computers so they have to invite me and right click is a challenge.
 I tried out meshcentral and it looks great but the developer may stop working on it.
 I need something very easy to use like teamviewer but probably more affordable and they seeem like the used car salesman of remote support.
 I definitely need multi monitor support.
 Quick assist is free but doesn&#x27;t let you see when the pop up for admin comes up to install something and my users don&#x27;t have local admin rights.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Ok so while typing what was going to be the original post this has started working, but for no apparent reason. This has now gone from a request for help to a quest of understanding.
 So a while ago I was doing some fiddling with a client Synology, had created a new backup folder, unmapped the old one, attempted to remap the new one. &quot;Invalid Password&quot;. Ok sure, that happens sometimes, thing is I didn&#x27;t actually need the drive to be mapped as the backup software (backup assist) could see the location and access it with the given details so I figured it&#x27;d be fine. Decided to fix mapping the drive after the next scheduled reboot.
 Everything was not fine, turns out that despite being able to see and access the NAS, when attempting to actually perform the backup task it would fail as &quot;unable to access the network location&quot;. Keep in mind, all I have done is make a new 2023 subfolder in the backup folder (we&#x27;re MSP, they like it that way) and try to map it back after removing the 2022 folder.
 So I make a new user, try to map it with that, nope, same thing. Despite being able to log into the device with these same creds that Windows doesn&#x27;t like.
 After that I restart things, bash my head against the wall a bit, find some other people who had similar problems that came about as the result of a setting change (none of mine have, double and triple checked), so I come here, begin writing my post, and mid way through I decide to try to map it one more time.
 It fucking works.
 And I haven&#x27;t even done anything. I didn&#x27;t even have to type the details in, it just immediately worked and mapped it like there&#x27;d never even been a problem.

 Our app is built in javascript and we use hubspot as CRM. We are losing tracking data on users signing up with SSO. In CRM, all those users show up as &quot;User created through offline sources or integration&quot;. Product/Tech team is way too busy to figure it out for me. Anyone has any experience with this? I would love to get you guys more answers if you think this post needs a little more details. Please help as I have been researching a lot with deadends. Thank you so much!

 If you have an NVR seggerated into it&#x27;s own VLAN and is port forwarded, would you just simply assign it a public DNS like google or still use internal (with ACL restricting that VLAN to only communicate with DNS server on tcp/udp 53)?

                              <span>With the data breach that happened for LastPass, I see many people (rightfully) being critical of LastPass but also recommending other similar services like BitWarden?
 I can see using KeePass on a local device for obvious reasons can be more secure, if you know how to keep the KeePass files away from others, but why do people consider BitWarden to be a safer alternative to LastPass? Is it just that LastPass has been breached and BitWarden not (at least to our knowledge) or is BitWarden doing something different that puts them ahead of LastPass?

 I want to know what are some of the account recovery processes you have found are good in the case that someone looses MFA app/phone/recovery codes.
 I’ve found some great flows but wanted to see what I haven’t thought of.

                              <span>hello :)
 we have a big problem at our RDS System and our Print Server.
 I need more time to analyze it but i dont want the users to always call it so we can restart the print spooler.
 So here is my plan:
 i activated the log funtion in &quot; Get-WinEvent Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational &quot;. If the problem occours we can see it in the Event-ID 821 (which gets created everytime a print happens on the client that tells you the status. if its status 0x0 everything worked, if its not 0x0 there was a problem. In our case we always get the status code 0x6BA: example: https://imgur.com/a/kAOQJf3
 So i want an workaround for our endusers that automaticly checks if there is something different than Status: 0x0 in the 821 Event.
 The Question is how to do it right? I can create an trigger in the taskscheduluer for event 821 but keep in mind that in event 821 the successfully and failure prints are listed. Is there a way with custom XML-Filtering? 
 Can someone give me a tipp or example for the right direction?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all - about to be running a migration to get us the hell off of box and onto sharepoint instead.
 ​
 Opinions of sharepoint aside, one of the biggest problems I have right now is shit data in / shit data out. Does anyone know of a good, reliable way to deduplicate data either in Box or in sharepoint?
 This box environment is an unholy mess and despite asking repeatedly the various leads have somehow not gotten around to cleansing their own data - meaning there are duplicated folders all over the damn place.

                              <span>Hi,
 A have about 90 static websites that will be deployed over 2 webservers at 2 public cloud providers. I want to put a load balancer in front of them to auto failover. But I don&#x27;t want to bother setting up and managing a HAproxy or KEMP. I&#x27;m now looking at cloudflare, which costs 5 euro a month per site. Are there any alternatives I could be looking at? 
 Thanks

                              <span>We have a wildcard DNS entry for a couple of our domains. On one of them we are seeing an massive amount of traffic toward non-existing subdomains. We had this the first time in the beginning of February with about 2,5 million request over 4 days. Annoying but not something our webserver could not handle. Did an abuse report to Azure as it was an IP address in their space. 
 Yesterday at 1am a new scan started, again from a Azure IP address. Did a new abuse report but after 750000 request I had enough and blocked the IP address around 2pm, to my surprise the second I blocked te IP address the pattern moved from 1 IP address to random IP addresses from all over the world. At this moment I have more than 19000 IP addresses. The rate of requests has slowed down but still we see around 15000 requests an hour. 
 Anybody experienced this?
 My idea is removing the wildcard entry and just add the necessary subdomains to our DNS (would be around 70-100), my co-worker however things it is useless.

 Just thinking each time you exclude a user or make a change to the MFA policy it wants to exclude the admin account. This could easily catch someone out and they accidentally exclude an admin so it has no MFA
 Also yes I&#x27;ve got a break glass account with multiple 2FA methods. Don&#x27;t like having an account without MFA

 Using the Microsoft example if I just turn on dedupe on the drive in question which is the percent saving I should be focusing on here is it 66% or 4% please?

                              <span>Morning all,
 Work for a CSP and we have an Excel sheet that we copy + paste each month to record backups for customers, each backup type (i.e. offsite or onsite) and what we back up (physical server, VM&#x27;s). To record success/failure - each cell has a tick box. We get emails to a specific shared mailbox for the backups, so the process of recording the backups is to check the folder for a given client, tick if the expected backup succeeded, go on to the next (and of course if there isn&#x27;t a tick, investigate why).
 Problem being that it&#x27;s pretty slow to load several thousand tickboxes and as soon as we create a new backup/new customer it completely drags it down. We create a new document every month. It&#x27;s been this way for a few years but given the recording of backups takes 30 minutes a day and feels like a early 2000&#x27;s solution - feeling there&#x27;s got to be a better way.
 What&#x27;re you doing to record your backups?

                              <span>Our company has gone fully remote over the last few years and might be looking at terminating a remote employee. We are a fairly small company and to be honest, haven&#x27;t had to fire any once since we have been full remote. I still need to work out the details with HR, but I got the impression this will be over a teams call. Our business works with a lot of customer data that this individual has access to, and want to cut that access almost instantly after the call. Here is a bit about our environment:
 User has a laptop that is Intune enrolled. We have our DCs in Azure and use a lot of the typical MS services such as teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.. This particular user has some of our customer files SharePoint doc libraries synced with OneDrive to his local machine.
 If while we are on the call, his password is changed, SharePoint and files access removed, doesnt this take some time to sync? I believe the last time I removed some ones Azure files access, they had it for several more hours. Is this the same for Sharepoint? We do have &quot;Automate&quot; installed on his machine, so I could force a reboot, but if he is not on the VPN at the time, the password might not sync and still be cached. I did some research and saw there is a registry item that can be changed.
 Although I could wipe the machine with Intune, I do want to be able to go through the machine and make sure he does not have local files that need moved to a project directory on the network. 
 Will a password change instantly cut his access on his phone as well, or do I need to revoke those tokens as well?
 I would appreciate any suggestions to make this as streamlined as possible, its not something we are particularly excited about having to do, but they are leaving us no choice.

                              <span>Wondering if anyone has an answer to an issue I have with the Number Matching process on MS Authenticator.
 I have browsers setup to open two tabs for two separate systems when a user launches a browser.
 When a user opens a browser and number match is enabled, the user gets two different two digit codes for entering into their authenticator app. One for each tab.
 Is it possible to have a single code for the two tabs that are launching simultaneously or is this just the way it works?

                              <span>Hi,
 I need a way to analyse if OS packages (OEL/RHEL/Ubuntu/Debian) are vulnerable to a CVE&#x27;s. Most vendors have an oval file that describes &quot;package with version lower than XXX is vunrable&quot;.
 I have an ansible playbook that gathers all the packages and writes them to a server (a file per host)
 I know there are a lot of tools and ways to see if a system in vulnerable to an CVE (oscap/vuls...). But nothing that is actually without installation of the tool on the server itself.
 So I was wondering if there are tools/scripts that just have a parser of OVAL with an input &quot;a package or a package list&quot;
 something like
 cvereport.py -i server_packages.list -o oval file.
 I know oscap-ssh exist and that might be a solution. Vuls also looks like it is agentless but I want to avoid having &quot;another inventory to maintain&quot; (ansible and vuls)

                              <span>Hi!
 I have to point our Public DNS A record to CNAME. I have the following plan and just wanted to check if this looks ok or any input. 
  
Change the TTL to 10 minutes for A record.
 Delete the A record.
 Wait for 20 minutes before the cache will be cleared and check from different computers to be sure that A record is dead.
 Create CNAME for this deleted record.
  
If anyone has some suggestion then do let me know.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m a senior sysadmin and devops engineer and had been the sole IT guy at a startup.
 When the startup began ramping up production, we added another sysadmin to our team whose resume looked great, who interviewed well, and came with good references. We discovered pretty quickly, however, that he had only worked in Tier 1 and in many ways was even greener than someone straight out of school.
 In his first week, he broke our PowerAutomate workflows by messing around with our Azure Automation Account... as in he deleted it and attempted to recreate it but denied having touched it. Nothing else explains how the client ID changed, nor why the API permissions were incorrect and the callback URI&#x27;s were missing. This ended up being extra work on my plate getting everything running again.

                              <span>So this may be a stupid question and maybe I&#x27;m reading too much into it, but here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m unsure:
 I deal with Cybersecurity Insurance Questionnaires for our clients. A lot of times it&#x27;ll ask if server databases are encrypted at-rest, and from my understanding and from what tools we use, this is basically asking &quot;Is Bitlocker enabled on server data disks?&quot; and the answer is typically No.
 However now I have this question for a client who&#x27;s servers are all Azure VMs. These do not have Azure Disk Encryption enabled, which from my (potentially limited) understanding, means Bitlocker is not enabled on the virtual disk. However, Azure VMs by default live on Microsoft&#x27;s data centers, and the physical disks in those data centers have server-side encryption (SSE) 
 So my question is... does this count for at-rest encryption as far as this cybersecurity questionnaire is concerned? Because from my (again, probably limited) understanding, at-rest encryption is intended to protect against someone getting access to the physical disk, and sure this would prevent it if someone broke into the Microsoft data center and somehow stole the disk this VM lived on so that would seem to make the answer to the question &quot;Yes&quot; in the most technical sense. But if someone gained access to the Azure environment &amp; stole the VHD file, then Bitlocker isn&#x27;t enabled on that file and could presumably read all the contents then it&#x27;s like... was at-rest encryption really even on? Is at-rest encryption explicitly a protection against physical data breaches? Or should at-rest encryption include VM disk encryption when the server in question is a VM?
 Or maybe I&#x27;m thinking too hard about this?

                              <span>Hi,
 We just started to receive a few calls from users informing us, that some Microsoft Apps on iOS seem to be stuck on updating.
 Looks like they are being offloaded by iOS, guessing by settings &gt; general &gt; iphone storage, but to my suprise, the offloading setting isn&#x27;t even accessible/visible under settings &gt; app store &gt; app offloading.
 Unfortunately, those devices are DEP and MDM enabled AND the Company Portal App (Intune) is also offloaded, so those other apps are never gonna get updated due to &quot;broken&quot; devices. 
 Best workaround is to fully reinstall the device, which is cumbersome.
 ​
 Does anyone have a clue on how to prevent or undo this? I couldn&#x27;t find an MDM switch for this Intune or on the web.

                              <span>We managed a bunch of RDS Collections for several customers, we deploy the RDP file that is generated as part of this that you can download from RDWeb after the collection is setup, this is the file that&#x27;s digitally signed as part of the setup - generally this just &quot;works&quot;.
 All of a sudden yesterday morning we got a report of an error on a customer when trying to connect into their collection, the error appears when double clicking the RDP file:
 &quot;The digital signature of this RDP File cannot be verified. The remote connection cannot be started.&quot;
 Interestingly, some users still worked fine however, and these were users sat next to each other in the same office.
 Now, we&#x27;ve seen issues where the signature can throw off the RDP file sometimes so we edited the file in notepad and removed both the &quot;signscope:s:&quot; and &quot;signature:s:&quot; values, this allowed it to work, obviously this bypasses the whole &quot;digitally signed&quot; part of the file.
 We checked the usual before this, ensuring all the certificates were valid etc. (they were) and no weird updates had been applied to clients or the relevant servers (they hadn&#x27;t) so we deployed this file to affected users.
 However, we then got a report from another customer with the same issue, then a third reported the issue. Our initial thought being some sort of CA issue, but two of these customers used Sectigo, the other was R5/GlobalSign so that ruled that idea out.
 We couldn&#x27;t find a reason for this so eventually just had to remove those two lines from the files and it seemed to resolve the issue. A cursory glance around the Internet only really flagged this issue when using self signed certs, we aren&#x27;t.
 Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! At the moment we have only seen this at 3 (maybe 4) customers but obviously don&#x27;t want to see this get more widespread!
 As an additional point, the RDP file &quot;breaks&quot; regardless of where it&#x27;s used from, so it doesn&#x27;t look to be the originating network that&#x27;s the issue.

                              <span>Recently bought an hp elitedesk 800 g6, and the unit has admin password so I cannot get into the bios oor move forward with a windows 10 installation as it prompts for email credentials for the business they were retired from and no longer exists.. Is this e waste or has anyone figured a way to reset the bios like the older models? On the side of the cpu fan kn the mother board there are two pin holes labeled pswd, tried bridging them wjth a paper clip in hopes but that didn&#x27;t work or it didn&#x27;t conduct enough. Jus throowing crap at the wall to see what sticks Thanks for any help.

                              <span>Hi have set up a RDS environment and it works fine. But when connecting from outside the domain, RDP seems to respond slow, a 20 second timeout and then proceeds to connect. But when inside the domain, it works fast. According to my wireshark capture, RD gateway tries to do LDAP to clients DC and not it own. Anyone have any tips?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have some question to ask here. Is it the size of recycle bin in the server too big, can effect the performance of that server or take space from it? I have client that never clean their data in recycle bin and now the deleted data in recycle bin almost 200++ GB and now they have difficulties to clean from recycle bin as it spike the memory up to 100% when do the deletion. Please advise.

 I’m coming from a C8540 where this was an AireOS option in AP groups and I feel like this should be configureable within an RLAN profile on the 9800.
 Trouble is, only way I’ve found to enable the LAN ports is in the per access point configuration. Got 1000 of these to deploy and there must be default or global way to do this. Anyone come across anything that I’m missing?

                              <span>Hi all
 Trying to get into deeper networking and I&#x27;ve been wanting to get into monitoring/analysis on my network so I&#x27;m looking to get some recommendations for this
 I have a couple of scenarios in which I&#x27;m trying to monitor/log certain packets being sent from a machine to the internet. 
  I have two PCs sending some data to a specific destination that I want to monitor on and store for analysis at a later date. Data is not encrypted on the wire.
 I have four PCs that sends some data out to the internet that I want to run through a self built TCP proxy to simulate some network conditions without running the proxy on any client.
 I was wondering if any of this is possible straight out of the switch itself via some configuration/port mirroring or if it&#x27;s possible to build a proxy machine with 2 quad NICs where I could basically bridge 2 ports for data to come in and out before it gets sent to a switch on the network where I could maybe run my proxy on the to monitor and maybe alter data being sent between the NICs.
 Don&#x27;t know if any of this is possible so any help would be gladly appreciated.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello Again, Reddit! I&#x27;ve come to ask for some help with a port forwarding issue I&#x27;ve got going on.
 My edge/gateway device is a Sonicwall TZ215 running SonicOS 6.X. I have an A record as sub.domain.tld on my public DNS that points to this device&#x27;s WAN interface IP. No issues there.
 My internal host is a Proxmox host running a few web servers. I have a port forwarding rule on the Sonicwall to reach the Proxmox web UI from the internet on HTTPS/TCP port 8006. I have an SSL certificate installed on the Proxmox host for sub.domain.tld. This works perfectly.
 I am now trying to add more web servers to this subdomain on other ports, i.e. https://sub.domain.tld:8443 and http://sub.domain.tld My issue is that I get an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in my browser for any other port.
 My NAT configuration for the other two web servers that I&#x27;m trying to reach matches the NAT configuration for the working web server, the Proxmox host on https://sub.domain.tld:8006, except I created a service object entry for HTTPS/8443. That&#x27;s the only difference. Still, I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.
 I did a packet monitoring in the Sonicwall appliance to try to isolate the issue and I see the traffic is being dropped to the internal hosts using 80 and 8443, due to &quot;Error code 40 (Enforced firewall rule)&quot;.
 There isn&#x27;t any kind of p@cket trac3r or traffic simulator like ASA has so I&#x27;m kind of at a loss. There really aren&#x27;t any other firewall policies set up since this is a really basic and new configuration, so I can&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;d be anything conflicting.
 The reachable web server and the non-reachable web servers are in the same network zone as defined by the Sonicwall, so it shouldn&#x27;t be an access issue either.
 I can reach the web servers both internally and on a separate network segment for VPN. 
 I&#x27;m stumped, any ideas? Thanks in advance for anyone&#x27;s input.

                              <span>So I was an SE at Verizon for a few years and one of the things that I did not realize before coming there was the distinction between an ILEC and CLEC. I realized that ILECs had certain legal obligations, but I didn&#x27;t realize how different they were organizationally.
 Verizon (when it came to networking services, at least) was essentially split into 3 different companies:
  
Verizon Business (Long-Haul Network Services + CLEC)
 Verizon Telecom (ILEC)
 Verizon Wireless
  
I never quite understand why it was that ILECs were treated like different legal entities, as nothing I read suggested it has to be that way... I&#x27;m not sure if all service providers do this, but I know for sure that AT&amp;T does. So for you old timers in telecom who understand a bit of the organizational/legal considerations surrounding networking, can you explain to me why it is that ILEC &amp; non-ILEC services are often split into different companies?

                              <span>just got off the phone with our AT&amp;T team. Trying to get a hold of what we get as service from them, POTS, Network connectivity, Fax lines (no one knows who is using them). As you can see accounting is a mess with AT&amp;T. 
 ​
 The team from AT&amp;T says it is extremely difficult for them to look into their own accounting system to find out what they are billing us 🤷‍♀️ We are also transitioning from a managed billing consolidation to internal ap team and need to setup AT&amp;T as a vendor. 
 ​
 I want to do the process right, but at the same time want to run away from AT&amp;T. 
 ​
 My internal team is telling me that AT&amp;T owns a lot of last mile circuits for many of our facilities. 
 ​
 Any thoughts on how to approach this ? 
 ​
 Essentially it&#x27;s a mess out there. Any help / guidance will be appreciated.

                              <span>Just thought I&#x27;d do a PSA for this in case anyone runs into this issue again. We had a request to make some NDI capable cameras work with OBS over our enterprise wireless (this particular SSID had to be created on our older Cisco 8510 due to the APs involved). The cameras themselves I believe are Mevo brand.
 After making some tweaks to get the cameras connected and accessible from the Mevo mobile app (client isolation was turned on in the WLAN config so easy fix), the next issue was that the devices were not being discovered as NDI camera sources in OBS. NDI uses mDNS but I was having issues finding the specific service string so we could add it to the mDNS snooping allow list. Ended up doing a packet capture to find it: 
 _ndi._tcp.local.
 Simple enough but even searching this in Google now that I know the answer didn&#x27;t bring in a lot of results so I wanted to post this and hopefully it is helpful to someone in the future.

                              <span>I have a building with 5 stacks of Cisco C9200L switches. Across all of those I have one VLAN which is our AV VLAN with about 180 devices of various types of AV equipment from Teams Rooms to Dante microphones/speakers, amplifiers, control systems and Crestron NVX encoders/decoders. Everything works perfectly fine. 
 I’m trying to add a new audio conferencing solution that needs to connect to some cameras using ONVIF for control. The main system sends out a discovery to the network to find any cameras. The cameras can also be manually added but then after populating the details it sends an ONVIF discovery probe to get all the details of the device. These processes don’t work at all on the AV network. If I change the addresses of these devices to any other subnet it works. 
 My assumption is that there’s too much traffic flying around on that network and the messages are getting blocked somehow. I’m at a loss as to how to rectify it though. All the stacks have 10gig uplinks with no saturation, igmp snooping configured, igmp querier set to collapsed core Nexus. Any ideas what I might be missing?
 Edit: I got it. It was an issue with MTU and jumbo frames.

 ​
 Sorry if this is a dumb question. we&#x27;re going to have pro services work on it and I just want to get more insight into the project. Thanks in advance

Ran into an issue where someone had the labels swapped on our MPLS interfaces, went in and deleted all the tunnels because they were still showing src and dst as two different MPLS carriers. But it takes over an hour to orchestrate the changes.

For example if I would like to know if BGP best path calculations are handled in hardware on isr4331 how could I know that? Because official cisco data sheet isn&#x27;t really useful: &quot; High-performance multicore processors support high-speed WAN connections. The data plane uses an emulated Flow Processor (FP) that delivers Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-like performance that does not degrade as services are added. &quot; They do mention about hardware acceleration for ipsec but nothing more than that.

                              <span>So I am trying to redistribute some specific static routes into my OSPF process, basically any static routes with a next hop of 10.27.4.1 should be redistributed.Can anyone advise a simple way to do this? At the minute I&#x27;ve created a prefix-list/route-map permitting the routes individually, but obviously this isn&#x27;t hugely scale-able going forward.
 I saw a blog post that mentioned doing this with the next-hop option in a prefix list:
 ip prefix-list STATIC-NEXT-HOP seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 match ip next-hop 10.27.4.1 
 but I can&#x27;t actually find this as a valid Cisco command anywhere, and even if it is it isn&#x27;t available on my C9000.
 Seems there must be a simple way to do this but I can&#x27;t figure it out right now!
 I also tried an access list with &quot;permit ip any host 10.27.4.1 &quot; and feeding this into a route-map but that didn&#x27;t play along either.

                              <span>Hello community, 
 Long time lurker here. For the past 2 years I set up my own company and I have been working as a B2B contractor as a network engineer. This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).
 Won&#x27;t get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it&#x27;s one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC&#x27;s for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They&#x27;ll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant. 
 The reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I&#x27;m single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I&#x27;m curious what is the status of remote work where you&#x27;re currently at ?
 This contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence. 
 Since the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ? 
 Also, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to me in private.

 I cannot find any info about this on Google but i&#x27;m sure Cisco makes different digest for same key that used in AAA configs. I verifed it with Clearpass cluster also.
 Are you familliar with this?

                              <span>Hello folks -
 Feel strange asking this as someone who has done networking for about 25 years now but this just seems so weird to me. I have never interfaced with Cisco Nexus before, and have no idea how this network is setup(other than badly). Just got access to the devices today.
 I&#x27;m trying to setup monitoring of the switches and one of the Dell switches is giving me trouble. It&#x27;s not an issue with the switch, the issue is I can&#x27;t ping that switch from some systems on the network but can from others. There are two switches side by side 172.16.1.23/16 and 172.16.1.24/16. The problematic one is .23, I cannot ping it from at least 2 different windows servers(internal windows firewall is disabled) on the same subnet but can ping it from a linux server on the same subnet. I assumed at first …</span>

Every iteration of a speed test provides different results not to mention each brand of speed test also provides different results. Regardless if the speed test is over vpn tunnel or NOT on the vpn tunnel it is inconsistent as well. Is there generality/commonality constraints or variables that I can use to educate the pseudo Network person on why they are not getting full ISP bandwidth and why it is inconsistent?

 ​
 We have purchased an Aruba 2530 48G (J9775A) switch which i plan to use to replace a number of really old HP procurve 2512 (J4812A) switches, they are currently connect by Fiber module (J4853A) 
 Do you know what the equivalent SFP module would be for the Aruba? im unable to cross reference the parts?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>What are best practices when it comes to gaining visibility into OT networks, so that one can start better segmentation and applying more security, and in the end safely extracting data that resides in the OT enviorement? 
 Im having several discussion with both Cisco, OT vendors and customers regarding the best way to start such projects. Some says that SPAN/RSPAN into Micosoft Defender for IoT or equivalent product is sufficient, others say that SPAN will create problems and one must get Cisco cybervision and switches with sensors.
 Anyone have experience or some advise on what to keep in mind in different scenarios? I know that the Cisco solution works fine, but in big networks it will get really expensive.

                              <span>I have been looking for a Trainee Network Installer job for a couple of years now but there haven&#x27;t been too many in my area.
 I am wondering if I should get a CCNA certification to maximize my chances of landing a role but I&#x27;ve heard from interviews (I&#x27;ve asked if the company offers this cert in interviews) that it&#x27;s not required to do the role and the same goes with CNCI.
 There&#x27;s an trainee installer role I&#x27;ve been interested in but they don&#x27;t offer CCNA certification, only the CNCI. 
 I ask because taking CCNA will come out of my own pocket and if a Network Installer firm doesnt specifcally look for it and says its not needed then I wouldn&#x27;t take it. I know that CCNA is one of if not the most popular IT course so it shocks me that a trainee position in a network role doesn&#x27;t offer it as part of their programme.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am in the early stages of getting started with Ansible for some network automation. Currently, use cases are small for now (update helper-addresses, NTP servers etc) but I expect to go further down the rabbit hole and maybe leverage it for full site deployments.
 Anyway, one of the things that is being discussed is integration with Jenkins CI/CD. As a pure network engineer, I honestly have no idea how Jenkins works and what is involved with it and why it would be beneficial to us but none the less I will need to research it.
 So first question, is there any resource out there (book, blog, youtube etc) that gives some good insight into Jenkins purely from a network perspective? 
 And finally, is Ansible Tower considered CI/CD? Ansible Tower to me seems just like a GUI for pushing playbooks which would obviously make it more user friendly for someone who want to push a playbook but not have to write the code in Ansible. Example, would be that I create a bunch of playbooks and someone else who is not fully up to speed, could just come along, modify the variables to the relevant devices, and then push it out. Is this what Jenkins tries to achieve?

                              <span>Hi, as TAC is telling me they can&#x27;t help before tomorrow i figured i might give you guys a shot. 
 We have a new Firepower1150 we are attempting to add to our FMC. We see traffic arriving on both ends using TCP dumps, however it keeps throwing a &quot;could not establish connection with device&quot; error. 
 In the pigtail logs i see the sftunnel establishing, then it seems like it keeps looping on this &quot;sfmgr:sfmanager [INFO] Waiting for RPC service to be published on peer&quot;
 If anyone has encountred this issue before any and all help would be apreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been experiencing a weird issue with my production dell L3 router S6000-ON. Once a week or soall of its port-channel members ungroup and then immediately group back up (I have lacp long-timeout set). I turned on RSTP and LACP debug events but it essentially just logs the fact that those ports ungrouped and not the reason why they did it in the first place. No alarms or other environmental thresholds were reached. I&#x27;m trying to find some kind of event or traffic burst in my network to explain these events but it is difficult. I&#x27;m trying to think of ideas of what I could check to figure this one out.
 I changed the firmware from the older to the latest but it didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.
 ​
 I noticed some possible causality on one of my access switches connected to the router. I was migrating my router from old hardware to new and the issue of port-channel flapping moved to the new after moving this particular access switch (although I can&#x27;t be sure). I noticed that port-channel for that switch has counter for &quot;giants&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure if that can have any affect on the switch itself (giants &#x3D; packets that are greater than the MTU size).

 Am working with a partner on industrial SD-WAN deployment , we are evaluating more than one vendor. The question is : Does Versa has industrial/ruggedized ? I could not locate any within data sheets!
 Appreciated.

                              <span>It took me almost all day to track this down, so I just thought I&#x27;d share. Early this morning, I was investigating what appeared to be packet loss on our several hundred megabit fiber internet connection. I contacted my ISP and had them check everything, but everything was pointing to our core router. 
 On the router itself, I noticed dozens of connections from our internal workstations on the LAN, going to handfuls of the same destination IP addresses located at various Akamai CDNs on port 443. The issue had gotten so bad, that I had to block the offending connections at the router level just to stop it from causing all of this packet loss, because it was maxing out our internet connection, and our Mikrotik CCR1036 router couldn&#x27;t handle it.
 At first, I thought this had to have been Wind…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 Are there any guides for how to administer FIDO physical security keys like Yubikeys for an entire team/organization?
 The biggest hurdle I would expect to see is a user losing their key. I don&#x27;t understand how organizations which require all users have physical keys handle this on an administrative level, and I am struggling to find any real world examples/best practice documentation on it. 
 I understand for any account fully controlled by your organization (such as Microsoft 365) that a lost key can be handled from an administrative portal. But how do you handle a lost or broken key on accounts that you do not have full administrative control over, such as a social media account? If you require your staff to register a backup key, does that not create other issues (my knee-jerk reaction is end users would end up carrying the backup with them so they can always have it to register both at once, or would forget to bring in the backup key so it never gets registered, both of which defeats the purpose of the backup key) or do you require that the IT department register additional keys on MFA setup?
 Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this just something that sysadmins just deal with? It would seem to me that the best way of solving this would be if a YubiKey/similar product could be &quot;paired&quot; so that one key could register both itself and a cold backup key that is stored elsewhere (held by IT in a corporate use case) without having to carry both.
 Thank you for any insight,

                              <span>Bunch of layoffs just happened and I&#x27;m inheriting basically the entirety of the I.T. department responsibilities besides our I.T. director (who was not apart of these layoff decisions). My manager was pretty shit at documentation or even letting people know when changes occurred. 
 I&#x27;m a desktop support guy and need to learn a bunch of things VERY quickly. I only have my A+ certification and have very limited (if at all) network, server, or security knowledge. I&#x27;ve done some things but it&#x27;s not something I would&#x27;ve put myself in charge of.
 Besides jumping ship, I&#x27;m looking for some resources to up my game up rather quickly. My director is going to attempt to get the company to pay for some trainings for me, but budget was the reason layoffs happened so.... we&#x27;ll see.

 I think it could be KB5022405? Is there anything we can do to fix the issue this update causes? Or is there a reason why Microsoft did this on purpose?

                              <span>Says &quot;The Guardian&quot; this morning. The machines are complicated and incomprehensible, and take more than five minutes to learn. “When I see a printer, I’m like, ‘Oh my God,’” said Max Simon, a 29-year-old who works in content creation for a small Toronto business. “It seems like I’m uncovering an ancient artifact, in a way.” &quot;Elizabeth, a 23-year-old engineer who lives in Los Angeles, avoids the office printer at all costs.&quot; 
 Should we tell them that IT hates and avoids them too, and for the same reasons?

                              <span>Hello, I have set up a DFSR on my server A. The folder is called &quot;share&quot;, and it is replicated on my server B. All this is working fine, but my question is: is it possible that if my server A is down, my DFSR switches to my server B, because when I stop my server A, server B does not take over. I have enabled sharing on the replicated folder on Server B, the path is correct, but when I click on the folder in question from a client machine, it cannot access it. There is no problem with NTFS permissions or GPOs, I am testing on a dedicated ESXi. Server A has the role of ADDS, DNS, DFS and DFSR. Server B has the role ADDS, DNS, DFSR.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Specifically, Chrome (of course). One of our customers had a previous RDS setup where some process/software on the backend was terminating any Chrome sessions when a user disconnected their RDS session, in order to free up the memory/CPU cycles. Been doing some light searching around this today and have not seen any good solutions so far. 
 Anyone have a way to do this with native tools? Perhaps something along the lines of using PS to output disconnected sessions on each session host, then outputting the processes each session has, looking for chrome.exe?

                              <span>My internet has been dropping daily for the last couple of weeks. I restart the modem and everything is fine. I try to call support and I am not permitted to speak to a human unless I go thru the troubleshooting process which will have me restart the modem. That will fix the issue. There is no way to report an intermittent issue. 
 Any way on to the issue: my ssid is similar to xxxxxHome. After not doing the modem reset, I got to a tech. They said that any ssid that contains the word “home” causes issues. Must be a new feature, because the ssid hasn’t changed in years.

                              <span>I’m looking for the most successful ways of doing this. It seems it makes sense to consolidate the application with the least amount of data and configurations. 
 Have you done this?
 What did you do to help convince stakeholders that the chosen tenant was the right one?
 Thanks!

 it&#x27;s hard to find a lot of info regarding this topic. What self service solutions exist that offer the ability to offer forms and scripts to teams to order stuff like VMs, IPs, etc. pp. and also have the ability for something like an approval workflow where certain teams have to approve certain orders?
 Thanks already

                              <span>Ok, so I have a real strange one. Windows 11 (why did I upgrade)?? Outlook 365 (NEWEST VERSION) after about 4 hours becomes unresponsive and when restarting the application it will get stuck on LOADING PROFILE. Like all good sysadmins I did my google searching forever on this and there is not one thing (rebuild profile, reinstall Office, repair OST, rebuild OST, turn off bad add-ins that do nothing but slow you down, reset the navpane, everything) that hasn&#x27;t worked. The ONLY thing that works is once it gets into that state, a quick reboot fixes it for another 4 hours. I keep saying 4 hours because it&#x27;s been close to clockwork when it happens 4-5 hours later.
 Talk about an annoying piece of crap. We all can have our rants on crappy MSFT software updates and programming. However, I have had a few other users with the new version of Outlook with similar issues, but the beforementioned methods have worked (but it eats up precious time none of us have). The difference with my users is they are all Windows 10, and I was the idiot that was smart enough to upgrade to Windows 11.
 Any thoughts? Other than the IT guy is an idiot (I hate that I can&#x27;t even figure out my own stupid issue)? Sure, I can drag MSFT into it (and probably will if I can&#x27;t get it figured out) but I thought I would turn to the much smarter guys first.
 Edit 1: Outlook will still hang even with an attempt to load in Safe Mode...
 Edit 2: I have deleted fully all OST&#x27;s and rebuilt from the server twice now, not that either..

                              <span>Hello,
 I have currently issues with installing KB on WSUS itself. I downloaded the .msu file from microsoft catalog and when I try to install it on the WSUS server it keeps failing with the error message: 
 &quot;Some updates were not installed&quot;
 Error example: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hyTrLMmPo2E/hqdefault.jpg 
 It&#x27;s the same behaviour for all KBs.
 I have tried to run DSIM to clean the windows updates on the server but no luck:
 DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
 Myserver is a virtual machine on Windows Server 2012 R2
 Any ideas to advise on this matter please?
 Thank you guys!

                              <span>Seeing lots of RD gateway issues today: &quot;The digital signature of this RDP File cannot be verified The remote connection cannot be started&quot;
 ​
 Happening across many companies and different Windows servers from 2012 R2 to 2019.
 ​
 The cert on the RD Gateway is fine but the certs are all issued by Sectigo so perhaps that&#x27;s the issue.
 ​
 Quick fix is to backup the RDP file and remove the signing details from the end. 
 ​
 Is anyone else seeing the problem?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Currently using Sophos EPP for Endpoints which comes with Web Filtering included. Moving to SentinelOne for AV, so need another product to fill that gap. Our Endpoints are mainly laptops that can be in the office, WFH or WFH on our corp VPN.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of options; Mimecast Web Security, DNS Filtering products (Umbrella, WebTitan, DNSFIlter) and nothing has blown me away. All have weird quirks, seem quite easy to circumnavigate. I hear the next &quot;step&quot; is to go to some form of CASB, but wondered what your thoughts were?

 ​
 I&#x27;m running 3rd software on Windows Server 2016 on VMWare.
 AFAIK , The idea behind the so-called &#x27;best-practice&#x27; of 1.5x RAM has its roots in the 1990&#x27;s when RAM was very expensive. 
 There is a lot of advice out there talking about setting the size to 1.5 or 2 times the size of the memory that is installed.

                              <span>Hi all, i am looking into using a full ELK stack to monitor and visualise mainly windows servers, installation is however preferred on linux base. 
 To this extent i would love some feedback on current (2022/2023) ressources / implementation guides or even books on this subject. 
 Most of what i find is either 2+ years old or mainly general descriptions.

We provide IT services to whoever wants it from computer repair/ upgrades to installing and troubleshooting whole networks. My co worker and I would like to move away from the computer repair side and more onto networking stuff like switches and routers and setting up networks. Anyone have a idea on how to do that?

                              <span>I have two 2016 DCs that are outdated. The KB (KB5018419) update, which broke Kerberos, was not installed. After a successful installation of the latest CU (Feb 23, KB5022838) that includes a Kerberos fix on DC1, I encountered the error (Event ID 37: The Key Distribution Center (KDC) encountered a ticket that did not contain information about the account that requested the ticket while processing a request for another ticket).
 Updating DC2 to the same CU did not resolve the problem.
 Additionally, the printers shares are broken, and the main issue, an oldy software that uses SMB1 on two servers (2008 and 2003)- shares are not accessible by PC name anymore, only by IP. SMB1 is disabled on the rest of the servers and PCs in the domain.
 any tips?
 i guess error might dissaper after 5 days with renew kerberos tickets but the rest.

 I have two DC-servers in my home environment with Win Srv 2022. Both have been running since last summer without any problems. I have a few other servers and some desktops connected to mydomain.local.
 A month ago i switched out my firewall at home to a box running OPNSense. At that time i also started using VLANs. The plan was to move everything out from default LAN and i started moving some servers to VLAN 100 (MGMT) (they were already joined in the AD at that point).
 IP numbers of the servers in question:
  
DC01 192.168.1.201
 DC02 192.168.1.202
 ADM01 192.168.100.140
 APP01 192.168.100.151

                              <span>No, not you, fellow Redditors. I&#x27;m referring to the fact that after 35 years of working with physical (and virtual) servers, I have just shut down, what I&#x27;m hoping are, my last on-prem servers.
 I still have a few years to go to retirement so there&#x27;s still a chance but, for now at least, I fee liberated!

                              <span>Understand that cctvs are prone to hacking and I just happen to have one installed at my house recently. I’m keen on setting up a VLAN for my CCTV at home to minimise chances of my CCTV being hacked, as well as reducing the chances of other devices in my home network getting their security compromised.
 How do I go about doing this and does it cost a lot to setup a VLAN for my home CCTV? It would be great if I could have an idea of the exact equipment I need to purchase as well as a cost breakdown. Further, is it really necessary to have a VLAN set up to prevent an occurrence of hacking in a home network?
 I don’t have much technical knowledge in this aspect so a layman explanation would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

 In our environment we have some problem with inserting online pictures in office applications. 
 If you try to insert (or search) there is the following message:
 Its in German, so in English it would be something like &quot;Something went wrong. Try it again later.&quot;
 Anyone know this? 
 I googled it and there was some posts like &quot;internetoptions&quot; but didnt helped.
 Best regards

 We are working with a company who are on Google workspace. We are having a lot of meetings with them using Teams. We have added them to our tenant as guests but find they have a lot of issues joining. What is best to advise here? I&#x27;m thinking of telling them to use the web app and not log in to avoid any account/compatibility issues.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ll try to keep it as short as possible and go straight to the point:
  
Within our company we all make use of Office365.
 We make use of a Hybrid Azure AD system.
 One particular colleague has the issue that he keeps losing connection to the Exchange server within Outlook. This always happens after 1 or 2 hours of working.
 All other applications keep working fine.
 He closes Outlook to restart it again, yet Outlook won&#x27;t start anymore then.
 He has to reboot his laptop to make it work again, only to have the same problem occur after 1 or 2 hours again.
  
I&#x27;m running into a dead end what I can try here, this is what I&#x27;ve tried so far:
  
Quick repair of Office in Control Panel
 Online repair of Office in Control Panel
 Reinstalling Office
 Enabled Wireless Radio Control within BIOS (read somewhere that enabling this could help with the issue, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t).
 Reset the user&#x27;s password through www.office.com, while connected directly on our company network (to make sure the sync between Azure AD and our on premise AD is done correctly, as this has been an issue sometimes in the past).
 Removed the Outlook profile and made a new profile.
 Probably countless other things that I can&#x27;t think of right now.
  
Does anyone know what else I can try? It&#x27;s getting really annoying, especially for the end user.
 ​
 Thanks a lot for the help!

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 quick rant here but I need to get some steam off.
 I had a Website and some other lightweight stuff on my Oracle Cloud running.
 I was using the always free tier and was really happy with it until this happend:
 My Account got permanently terminated without ANY Reason, If you try to talk to support, they will just tell you that they cant do anything and swiftly close your Chatwindow. No Support Numbers are working whatsoever.
 So my quick piece of advice, do NOT use Oracle Cloud. 
 Love you all, have a nice day. &lt;3

                              <span>I belong to a school that allowed me to create my username, which is also my email address, and password from the web. No in-person on-boarding. 
 Those credentials (SSO) allow me to sign into macs and windows computers, not only the one in my desk but also any public terminals (library), albeit my documents only stay on my desktop Mac (they don’t sync to any Mac I log into). 
 Staff can bring their own devices and are able to use their SSO to access MS office, PeopleSoft (student information system), VPN, Adobe, DocuSign, Canvas, etc, all of which are downloaded directly from the developers or are web-based. Mixing personal documents with work documents isn&#x27;t discouraged because the important stuff (student records, financial stuff) can only be accessed on campus with school WiFi or a VPN for remote work.
 It seems only on-campus Macs and PCs are managed with MDM. If an employee prefers to not use their own computer for work, they can be issued an on-campus computer, in which software is downloaded through a program. 
 What is the technical description for this type of system? How can one replicate this for their own organization? 
 Is it easier to use cloud based products and manage a SSO instead of deploying and managing devices?

                              <span>Hello,
 We are about to migrate some customers to azure ad joined devices. They are all domain joined right now. We would love to keep the user data / settings and move it to the new azure ad joined profile on the device. It would also be great to migrate the installed printers to the new profile. How would you guys handle this?
 Edit: As some extra information, the reason why I am asking is. This company has users who feel very special, entitled, we already have to do some 1 on 1 sessions to make sure everything is allright. So we will touch all the devices, but some of them are not very IT knowledgeable and would freak out because there printer is not working or something is wrong with their device
 I have no issue in using third party tooling if it would make life easier for the users...

 I’m having trouble making much sense of sticking around here.
 Are there any job boards or sites that show companies willing to relocate/work visa sponsor someone? Just myself and a couple of cats… want to get far away from all of this.
 Looking for I.T. related sites/information that you can pass along to help me out. 
 Thank You!

 ​
 I am using Veeam-One for a small environment with 5 hosts and about 100 VMs. Although retention is already on &quot;1 month&quot;, I am reaching the 10 GB limit of the database.
 As the SQL-standard-license is quite expensive for such a small setup:
 ​
 Are you aware of any good methods to reduce the data-usage without using important features of Veeam-One?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

                              <span>Hi, has anyone had any experience with Dialpad VoIP system in Australia/New Zealand. We have recently shifted a portion of our business to use the cloud service to replace the previous telephone system but have noticed significant latency issues especially at the start of calls. My gut feeling says as the call session initiates with the &quot;Global SIP Network&quot; as they call it, it gets rerouted quite a bit which slows it down. I&#x27;d just like to know if anyone else has had subpar performance for Dialpad in Aus or NZ?
 Note) Did an Ookla speed test with an end user today reporting issues and they 278 down 114 up with 4ms to server, so I&#x27;m thinking very unlikely an issue on our side.

                              <span>I&#x27;m winding down my tenure with my current company. Leaving on good terms after 5+ years. The senior engineer is going on vacation for 2 weeks at the start of April. He floated the idea of me freelancing while he&#x27;s out. I&#x27;ve covered for him before. What I haven&#x27;t done is freelance. 
 I haven&#x27;t committed to anything yet. What considerations would I need to have in place before accepting an offer like that? Want to make sure I&#x27;m not putting myself in a bad spot if something goes sideways while I&#x27;m covering.

                              <span>Hi!
 (I have kind of the same issues as mentioned in this thread.) 
 I am working with ansible automation towards different cisco switches in my company and I have specific issue with VTY lines on IOS-XE 17.x 
 So on 17.03.04(9600) it looks like this: 
 9600(config)#line vty ?  First Line number 9600#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 
 And on 17.06.04(9300) it looks like this: 
 9300(config)#line vty ?  First Line number 9300#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 line vty 16 31 
 And that in itself is okey(pretty f&#x27;ing annoying tho), but the problem is when i try to remove excessive lines.
 On the 9600 it&#x27;s no problem, but on the 9300 i get this error:
 % Can&#x27;t delete last 32 VTY lines 
 Anyone has experience with this, and what did you do to solve it?

 I spent some time searching, but I am not able to find the right resources for my problem.
 My goal is to be able to login using SSH with my keyfiles using putty.I found this article: https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1000178166/3467af6a/configuring-an-ssh-user

                              <span>Heyall. I work for a small WISP (about 1200 customers) and there&#x27;s a lot of stuff I am needing to learn. Learning Cisco and learning Linux have both been &quot;easy&quot;. I put easy in quotation marks , because yeah the subject matter is kind of difficult, but at least there&#x27;s plenty of resources out there. LTE does not have nearly the amount of learning resources. 
 We just bought some licensed LTE spectrum , so our CBRS LTE will now be accompanied by real licensed LTE. 
 Id really like to know how all of this stuff gets implemented. Ever since I started here back in August of last year, I&#x27;ve been trying to find some reading material or some sort of course on this stuff but not really sure where to start.
 Anyone here know LTE pretty well? If so, what resources did you use to develop your proficiency on the topic?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I am trying to integrate Checkpoint firewall with Aruba ClearPass for TACACS. I couldn&#x27;t find any dictionaries available for CheckPoint in ClearPass or even the profiles. The plan is to configure basic AAA services with Checkpoint read-only, read-write and super admin roles. Can anyone please help me with the configurations to be done at both Checkpoint and ClearPass side?
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>I have added a &#x27;Custom field&#x27; within Netbox&#x27;s wireless groups to obtain the URL for WLCs to manage my APs. The custom field includes the WLC&#x27;s IP and port.
 These objects are further called into custom &#x27;links&#x27;, that will show as a button called &#x27;Wireless management&#x27; with the underlying url defined as https://{{ obj.cf.WLC_Managment.address}}:{{ obj.cf.port }}
 As I&#x27;m using the wlc IP address and the port as the object type, the URL always includes the subnet mask as shown below
 https://10.1.1.10/24:4343
 I can use &#x27;text&#x27; in custom field instead of an &#x27;IP address&#x27; object and get around the issue, but would like to see how I can use the IP address as an object and remove the subnet mask from the URL.
 I tried the following but that didn&#x27;t work
 https://{{ obj.cf.WLC_Managment.address | split(&#x27;/&#x27;) | first }}:{{ obj.cf.port }}
 anyone know how do I get the url as https://10.1.1.10:4343 in netbox

 What I simply need is some (very unscientific) numbers for what peers are using for your remote worker / remote access solutions, that I can then just reference in a &quot;top 5&quot; or so solutions I can dig a little deeper in some further comparative research.
 Can people just post the solution they use, or upvote if someone has already posted the same solution.
 Thanks

 Vlan 1 10 40 to use wan1 Vlan 20 30 50 to use wan2
 Odd thing today
 Vlan 10 and 50 are picking up dhcp but not internet Vlan 30 still works fine and so does vlan1 - these are on different wans so the internet is working fine on both wans.
 I&#x27;ve restarted DNS. Renewed dhcp etc but can&#x27;t figure out where it&#x27;s going wrong.
 UI edgerouter X is the router.
 Any ideas where to start looking? TIA

On a central building I will install a 19 inch rack with all the goodies, including a metal 12x dual-LC termination box for the single-mode fibers. Now I am looking for a small, preferably wall mount box, to terminate the fibers in the other buildings. Must exist, but I am probably looking for the wrong thing on Amazon and other sites.
 The buildings will all get a 4-fiber cable, with two dual-LC connectors. Any tips appreciated.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit, but I have a question. I currently have a load balancer and two on-premises web servers. I recently added a web server on the cloud and I want the load balancer to include this server in its configuration. Do I need to establish a VPN between the two on-premises servers and AWS to make this possible? is there any better way to do so? is it a bad design ?

                              <span>Slightly strange request....\
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with setting up temporary wifi and internet for a building. There are 3 floors and each floor is c. 80m x 50m. The floors are largely open - no walls, just empty space. We do not have access to the building&#x27;s internet and we may (or may not) have access to normal consumer-level electricity supply.
 It just needs to be be there for a couple of weeks. 50 wifi temperature sensors will beplaced on each floor and will connect to the wifi and transmit their small amount of temperature data to a cloud service.
 I&#x27;m thinking we will likely need three 4G mobile internet routers (one per floor) and then a wifi access point (or more than one) for each floor. And possibly a UPS for each floor to supply the power to them - although hoping that electricity will be possible.
 No floor-to-floor cabling will be allowed and only minimal, exposed cabling allowed on each floor.
 So I guess my questions are chiefly:
  
Will one WAP per floor be able to deal with 50 low-data devices and the 80mx50m area?
 If so (or if not) what devices would you recommend
 Anything else I ought to be thinking about?
  
Thx

                              <span>Hi guys,
 a consultant is strongly proposing us to use the router in object to substitute old Cisco Asr1002 as BNG, and to be used to terminate our geographical links between our datacenters where VPLS / VXLAN / EVPN are concentrated to make DCI 
 Do you have experience with this router? Aside from the china vs US competition, its cost/hw_specs is quite unbeliavable, and when something is too good to be true, usually something is hiding... 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hy all,
 I have an interesting problem. We are a small ISP/MSP and our upstream provider told us that users from two of our /24 IP ranges send very excessive DNS queries asking for the IP address of a.root-servers.net (their engineer told me that there were times when it surpassed google by a significant margin, even distorting their statistics for site queries).
 Now I am wondering what could even cause this; especially as there is very little overlap in infrastructure between the two IP ranges (and one of the ranges have a significant infra overlap with other unafected ranges)? Have any of you seen anything similar ever? Could it be a bug caused by a auto update of a common CPE brand?

 We support some customers which are doing DMVPN , they mainly create multiple vrfs , one for the DMVPN it self , another for breaking out guest traffic and so on, i want to understand what is the purpose of the RD under the VRF on the local CE Site? isn&#x27;t supposed this rd value be configured on the PE Instead ? what is accomplished by this configuration?

                              <span>So, we work for a real estate company, roughly 300 people. The CEO, CIO and President have built a habit of calling our help desk techs directly (or emailing / chatting in Teams), anytime they need IT assistance (even non-emergency ones). They have never submitted a ticket, which is what we want them to do. But they won&#x27;t listen, no matter how kindly we ask.
 their secretaries typically will submit tickets for them. But that rarely happens since they don&#x27;t go to their secretaries first when something goes wrong.
 Part of us is like, &quot;eh, they are at the top of the pyramid.. whatever.. just help them then open a ticket for them and move on.&quot; Another part of us is like &quot;no, they need to follow IT policy like everyone else!&quot;
 Just curious if this is an issue for the companies you work for? And how strongly you enforce the &quot;open a ticket before I can help you&quot; policy with the &quot;higher-ups?&quot;

                              <span>Hi all,
 just hoping for some assistance. 
 It&#x27;s a bit of a noob question, but im struggling to understand and implement 802.1x auth on my office&#x27;s wifi.
 I&#x27;ve created an nps server, added the Meraki AP&#x27;s, added the secret to the AP&#x27;s, and configured meraki to go to the NPS server. But my sticking point is installing and correcty configuring the certificate my boss gave me for the task.
 I&#x27;ve had very little to do with certs and whilst I understand the concept of pki I don&#x27;t understand how to implement in practice.
 Like I put the ssl cert in the personal store on the server and the 802.1x policy then let me choose it as the certificate to authenticate against. But then what part do i need to add to a users computer, and how do i get that out to them?
 I&#x27;ve just become massivley confused and would love if someone point me in the correct direction.
 Trying to hook it up to our AD on a win20212 r2 server

                              <span>So during an unscheduled conversation with my manager the bomb was dropped. I have to pick either be all in as a manager or be an admin/automation. This meeting was not contentious at all, the company is great and I&#x27;m still enjoying the time. But now I may have to lay down the ones and zeros and pick up the PowerPoint.
 It all kind of feels like the time I was with my dad when he told my grandma it was time to give up the car keys.
 So a bit of soul searching.
 I&#x27;m curious of your thoughts.

                              <span>So one of my end user computer got a BSOD today when he tried boot into windows. I have tried a couple of things such as re-plugging the HDD, resetting the BIOS, performing System Restore, Booting into Safe Mode but as you guess it, everything failed. The error persists, now I&#x27;m down to the last resort which is to reinstall windows but before going thru that, I was wondering if there is any other things I could try?
 Edit: I have also tried running chkdsk /f /r and sfc /scannow but both didn&#x27;t help much. The chkdsk didn&#x27;t find any bad sector. The disk have 4 partition and everything is correctly labelled such as C: Windows, D: New Volume, and also 1 Recovery partition and another system reserved partition. It seems like it does detect the HDD but couldn&#x27;t access the boot sector? I might be getting the wrong idea but that is what I understand.
 Edit 2: I decided to just reset the PC since I don&#x27;t have all day and user need it fast. I thank you for the suggestions that everyone gave me.

                              <span>In a new environment with poor documentation, I think past sysadmins have been lazy and removed inheritance deep on file shares. I would like to run a scan from the file servers to show me any folder that deviates from the parent folder on permissions. This way I can validate its business purpose, give it a proper security group and put users back into it. Then I can update new hire request forms to ensure new employees have the right permissions from the start.
 Any program or script to do this, or is there a better way then just nuking from the top and hoping I do not expose confidential info?

 I work full-time IT at a non-profit organization and there really isn&#x27;t a ton of work to do. I work under an IT director and we&#x27;re just a 2 man department.
 My boss is a total workaholic and it&#x27;s hard to get him to delegate stuff to me, so I feel like working with him is a competition in my own head to try to jump on top of any work to be done because if I don&#x27;t do the work within 5 minutes of it coming up, he just does it.
 Because the org isn&#x27;t terribly large, we end up running out of work to do pretty quickly, and I start to get a little nervous that I&#x27;m not doing enough, or that I might get laid off or something if I don&#x27;t continue to prove my worth to the org.
 The org I work for is actually awesome. I know a common perspective people have is to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck because &quot;coporate overlord dont care about you, employee,&quot; but this org has been amazing to everyone with very generous compensation, org-wide raises that consist with inflation and THEN some, great benefits, and an overall healthy and productive environment/community of people.
 So, I really want to be doing more and being more useful because I feel like i just don&#x27;t do anything all day and it&#x27;s eating away at my soul every night lmao.
 anyone got any good suggestions? how do you keep growing when there isn&#x27;t a fire under your ass?

                              <span>I did two interviews recently and was offered the sysadmin job. However since they only gave me midrange on the salary I counteroffered near the top end and then they just said &quot;I had withdrawn myself from the position&quot;. This was after I pointed out it was a 100% onsite job and that their offer was not commensurate* (edited, thank you /u/mudclub) with the cost of living in the area, especially housing. 
 There&#x27;s a big difference between withdrawing and being lowballed.
 I&#x27;m interested to hear from my fellow sysadmins on how salary negotiations have gone from an offer to employment or to just turning your back on a potential employer.

                              <span>This seems crazy to even ask, but I&#x27;d love to know if people have done it. I have a four post rack with adjustable depth where the post is a bit too close to the door. As it happens, it&#x27;s about as empty as it&#x27;s going to be right now. One server and one storage array that needs to remain on. And another server I can shut off.
 Has anyone ever, with equipment mounted, slid the posts forward or back? It requires loosening a couple nuts, but they&#x27;re in a track so it doesn&#x27;t look like any equipment could actually drop. But obviously I&#x27;m most concerned about vibration, and that&#x27;s the top reason I think this is a really bad idea. All three sets of rails mounted in the rack are adjustable depth.

                              <span>We currently use Rubrik, which is a single-box backup system. However, we have experienced a lot of issues with it recently, so we&#x27;re eyeing options. One of those options is Veeam. However, with that option comes the requirement of having a storage target.
 For those of you who use Veeam, what storage target(s) do you use? What target would you use if money was not an issue?

 Or the Sun rack with the PDU in the base, and when you were running cables from under the floor in to the rack, you&#x27;d inevitably hit the damn power switch and shutdown 1/2 the rack (IF... you cabled your power supplies correctly).

                              <span>So, I started testing out the new craze that is ChatGPT, messing with PowerShell and what not. I&#x27;s a nice tool, but I still gotta go back and do a bit with whatever it gave me.
 While doing this, I saw a ticket for our MS licensing. Well, it&#x27;s been ok with everyhting else I have thrown at it, so I asked it:
 &quot;How is your understanding of Microsoft licensing?&quot;
 Well, it&#x27;s been sitting here for 10 or so minutes blinking at me. That&#x27;s it, no reply, no nothing, not even an &quot;I&#x27;m busy&quot; error. It&#x27;s like &quot;That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m out&quot;.
 Microsoft; licensing so complex that AI can&#x27;t even understand it. It got a snicker out of the rest of the office.

                              <span>I initially had the whole story outlined, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary as I know this happens to all of us. What do y&#x27;all think is the best way to handle such situations?
  
Karen clients: User thinks they know what they are doing, messes up, then calls IT. I offer solutions and the less practical one is declined in favor of the more expensive/complicated one. Then they call my boss/co-worker/etc., who gives them the exact same [simpler] solution, which they take, and claim I never offered it.
 Agent 99 situation: My boss/co-worker/etc. already knew of the situation and my solution. Then they offer the exact same thing as if it was their idea.
  
EDIT (FEB-28-23): The most common and upvoted suggestion seems to be document, document, document. At this point I don&#x27;t know how much is paranoia and how much is reality. We are down to 40% staff and it&#x27;s either document or let things go. This particular situation is a wireless network with lots of environmental, feeder controls and alarms for live animal experiments. The person who put it in place was fired and the documentation is all out of wack. At the same time that the Karen client is adding/moving things in the network without consulting. Literally 0 minutes to sit down and Document everything in the ticket, as it flows so quickly and the karen does not read them (and once claimed IT almost killed their experiments)

Any tips for still having some sort of DNS protection/security. We don&#x27;t do much filtering but would love to still protect against ads, trackers and malware. Easy enough to enforce Quad9 on-prem but what about roaming devices? Use Intune to set or force a DNS server? Any tips? We have Bitdefender but it appears to mostly do broad category filtering.

Because these lists are on-prem, and devices are in Azure, there’s not much users can do to manage these lists. I’m curious as to how you handle this on your end. I was thinking about possibly migrating these groups into Azure, but not too sure on any repercussions of that change. I also thought about a 3rd party tool, but it may not be worth it, if there is something I can do with what I already have. Appreciate any thoughts or comments you may have. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello: 
 Quick question here. I am creating a 16TB storage array for a video surveillance system and was wondering what Allocation unit size would be best for this type of system? I was thinking 4096. Also, ReFS? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I work 9-5, Monday to Friday. I do my fair share of late nights too to get through the work. My manager will consistently schedule meetings for late Friday afternoon, and it absolutely wrecks my head. And these are not short meetings, they are usually big topics that could definitely wait until Monday
 I think he is a major **** for doing this so often. I want to keep my Friday afternoon free to tidy up loose ends, schedule my diary for the next week, etc. NOT to start something new. I want to finish at 5 to spend time with my kids, have a beer and relax. 
 He does not have family and lives alone so I think he doesn&#x27;t have much of a life outside work. 
 Any ideas how to approach? An invite just landed in my diary for 16.00 this Friday. I&#x27;m feeling very annoyed and don&#x27;t want to attend, but what excuse to use!

I tried editing the registry and setting a width for the card at 720. Unfortunately, that didnt work. Anyone seen this before? He&#x27;s running Office 2016.

                              <span>Wondering if anyone has came across this before. A VM has been migrated to Azure (a handful have) and since then RDP takes 2-3 minutes to log on. Just sits on &quot;welcome&quot; then eventually logs in. These migrations were done before I joined. Everything in the subscription that has been built fresh logs in straight away, migrated VM&#x27;s all have this issue. Not a massive problem but this is stopping me installing our MFA app as rdp times out before can get in, had to uninstall it via powershell in the end. Anyone come across this behaviour before?

Ok so, i want to create a task when an app closes itself or someone closes it, with task scheduler i want it to run the app that has been closed and only run the app when it really is closed. I hope it can be done with task scheduler, anyone know how can i do this?

                              <span>I built a Domain controller (Windows 2022) on VMWare workstation. Static IP address of course. Server is named HomeDC.home.local. I Also installed ADCS. I then installed a Windows Server to act as a web server to demonstrate the process of requesting a certificate AND certificate revocation. After adding the certificate to the default website on IIS, opening the page, webserver.home.local, says the server session is not secure. I can see the certificate on the web page, yet it still says its not secure. what am I missing?

                              <span>Seems like many of the legacy systems I interact with as a user have this. Banks, web portals for hospitals, and the like. This is where a user logs in with their credentials and then is shown the &quot;security image&quot; they picked out, like an airplane or a flower or some other random object. The page usually says something like &quot;make sure this is your security image!&quot;
 I can&#x27;t imagine this is supposed to sway those with criminal intent, is it supposed to prevent users from logging in to other accounts?

                              <span>Hello,
 i wrote a thread some weeks ago about performance issues on our RDS farm. I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).
 So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.
 For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. 
 Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). 
 I&#x27;m quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users. Its quite hard to see the real workload on other infrastructures. 
 So, could some people tell about their sizing in situation there the users doing a simiar workload?
 Thanks

 We have some users who need to be able to amend the COM ports in Device Manager on a regular basis, however we don&#x27;t want these users to have domain or local admin access. Does anyone know is this is possible and secondly, could this be done by Group Policy or via Regedit?

                              <span>We&#x27;re in the process of designing our back-up strategy in Druva. Druva offers a &#x27;Data Lock&#x27; option which prevents your back-up data from accidental/malicious deletion. 
 Let&#x27;s say an IT administrator accidentally back-ups a 5 TB VM with Data Lock enabled. (which should not be backed-up at all) We would than have to pay for the storage consumption for this VM the entire year? There is no work-around to overcome this? 
 I know this is the purpose of immutable back-ups, but cost is also a big factor when using cloud back-up solutions like Druva.

                              <span>Hello,
 As a form a security mesure for my school project I want to only allow a computer to join the domain if a computer account was provisioned in the domain.
 The expected behavior is that a randomly named PC can&#x27;t join the domain even if it&#x27;s using correct credentials.
 I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation online (Or i&#x27;m not using the correct words), do you have any idea on how to do that ?

                              <span>Currently in the process of retiring onprem server to go full sharepoint/aad. endpoints are setup in HAADJ. I know I need to wipe and re-enroll them with a new enrollment profile to get them into AAD fully, but if i were to offline the domain controller, would they continue working from AAD?
 Or do i need to wipe and redeploy the entire business in one go? I&#x27;m guessing not because that seems impractical for large business.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We have a client coming on board for support and would like a VPN. Normally we&#x27;d configure an SSTP VPN but in this case port 443 is already being routed to their webserver from the internet.
 If I forward another public port (say 414 as an example) to 443 private and point to the VPN server, would this work?
 I&#x27;d wager the connection address on SSTP client on other connecting windows endpoints would be vpn.CERTNAMEHERE.co.uk:414?
 Can you poke holes in that theory or point me towards a better solution?
 Besides another static IP that is referenced on the DNS entry to get to the WAN IP I&#x27;m struggling to come up with ideas.
 TIA!

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am new in a company and have noticed that the Windows firewall is deactivated on almost 3000 servers. The reason: The effort to configure the firewall is too great or the Windows firewall would be pointless anyway. I would now like to change this situation and gradually activate the firewall on all servers. The problem is also that the necessary IPs and ports are hardly or not at all documented.
 ​
 Now my question: How would you proceed to achieve this goal? Simply switching on the firewall would instantaneously paralyse most servers. Firewall
 My idea would be: First document the active connections with netstat and write corresponding rules, then activate the firewall with Allow-Any for a certain time and then study the log to find more IPs and ports.
 ​
 I am curious about your suggestions and thank you in advance for your ideas.

 How do you guys manage attribute changes (like department, title, manager etc.)? 
 Do you let HR do it themselves? If yes, via which way?

 I&#x60;m posting this for a colleague that has a problem on an VM running Windows Server 2019 about Task Manager.
 After you open task manager and on the tab Processes only Status, CPU, Memory are displayed and disk is missing. when he tries to enable the option its not available, its greyed out.
 The account used is domain administrator but this happens with a local admin account as well.
 Did someone stumbled upon this or could you help us with the direction to check with might cause this, maybe some settings in the registry.
 Thank you,

 I also tried this script but unfortunately this profile continues to be active:
 Get-ItemProperty -Path &quot;C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Packages&quot; | ForEach-Object {Remove-Item -Path &quot;$_\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin*&quot; -Recurse -Force | Out-Null}
 ​
 Do you have any idea how to permanently delete this profile?

 We migrated to M365, and let people work on their workstation. We offer some apps (including M365) as remote apps through RDS. We use Windows Server 2012 R2 (yea yea i know, we are upgrading asap)
 For the people saying, why don&#x27;t use the local M365 apps. Our back-office system only works good on TS-systems and needs Outlook and word for some functionality. 
 The issue is, when people open attachement in this outlook app or from our back-office system. The outlook &#x27;home&#x27; page (The page with inbox and all your e-mail) stays as the focused the screen. The openend attachement or e-mail from our back-office system stays behind that outlook screen until you open it from the taskbar. 
 I am getting the feeling it is an Server 2012 R2 issue or a remote app issue. When we used RDS with desktop for our users, they didn&#x27;t have this issue but we used Office 2010 then and Exchange 2013.
 Thanks in advance,
 Kind regards,
 Roy de Jonge
 p.s. English is not my primary language, i am sorry for any mistakes in spelling or grammar.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Is there a reliable method to block signing into Azure AD joined devices if user has an active Global Administrator directory role. Is this also possible via Conditional Access? Or should other means be used?

                              <span>Can someone confirm my thoughts on Group Policy Link Order.
 My example is:
 I have a group policy object assigned to an OU named Site1.
 With 2 GPO&#x27;s applied, which apply the same setting, on one the setting is Enabled, the other the setting is Disabled. One GPO is named PolicyObject1 and the other is PolicyObject2.
 PolicyObject1 has a link order of 1, PolicyObject2has a link order of 2.
 PolicyObject1 will be applied first, then PolicyObject2 will be applied, overwriting PolicyObject1.
 Am I correct, and if so, please can you provide some Microsoft Documentation regarding this? I&#x27;m fairly sure this is right, but I need the documentation to prove it. Thanks :-)

                              <span>Hey!
 We have been tasked with designing and deploying WiFi for an entire property of 150+ units, we are thinking about using UNIFI AP’s along with a cloud controller to handle the volume of devices. Any ideas for UN/PW management? We were considering using UNIFI built in Radius but that requires a UDM which can’t handle the amount of AP’s or PFSense Free Radius however unsure the smartest way to connect the 2. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello, 4 months ago I enrolled to Junior Network Administrator job because the previous Network Admin left. Before that I used to fix network issues on a basic level remotely. I was chosen because I was very interested in networking, internet and I would study at home while others wouldn&#x27;t. I have learned to configure switches like Alcatel, HP, 3Com, Nortel, Dlink, Dell, Netgear on a basic level. Vlans, port isolation, loop protection, troubleshooting why it wouldn&#x27;t work. We have only mikrotik dude to monitor entire network. We use only mikrotiks.What would be the best network monitoring software to monitor network for free? I can&#x27;t take care of my network if I can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on in it properly. The dude only displays bandwith after 24hrs. Service up, down with notification to telegram is setup so we can react quickly. Zabbix + grafana, prometheus + grafana?How to take care of network properly? What to monitor? What are free gpon monitoring tools? Zabbix seem to increase cpu load of gpon. I have basic understanding but I want to get better and take care of my network. I have to take care of a few data rooms, switches, security, I need to see what&#x27;s going on my network in switches, gpon, I want to get better at this. I was working for free to get any experience previously just to get hired somewhere. I found my favorite thing. Networking. When I like this, I have motivation. Could you help me? I need good material how to take care of network properly. Thanks. I&#x27;m not alone there&#x27;s a Senior Network Admin that takes care of servers, the work load is huge, when to learn? :) I want to help him. I&#x27;ll put less stress on him by taking care of my side of network. Help me a bit. Thanks! I feel like CCNA + Mikrotik Courses would be best atm. Which I&#x27;m going for.

 The ceiling is gyprock, then there&#x27;s a ceiling cavity roughly 1-1.5 metres high, with manhole access, then a concrete ceiling above that.

 There are existing cables run in the cavity - lighting, data, AV etc., as well as HVAC ducting
 There are some existing vertical metal rods, and some of the cables are cable tied to those - however, in general, most of those are loose, and there aren&#x27;t that many rods.
 My question is - if you were running new CAT6A cabling in this space - would you put the cables in some kind of conduit? Or how else would you keep them supported and tidy, and also in case you wanted to change them later? (I seem to remember something vaguely about supporting them in bundles, but can&#x27;t find the reference).
 Or would you just loose lay the cable on the gyprock ceiling itself?
 Or what other techniques do people use?

                              <span>Hello networking !
 I have a quick question for any pro installers out there. 
 I&#x27;m in the process of commissioning my new recording studio and I have my friends teenage son who&#x27;s interested in systems integration/audio production (kids these days) on site after school to help out with testing and to learn some wiring skills. 
 I&#x27;m teaching him to terminate RJ45&#x27;s and having him try to make some short ethernet cables (the first of which have been deliciously atrocious) and I wanted to give him a sense of what would be expected in a pro environment in terms of skills.
 I&#x27;d categorize my personal networking install level as apprentice+, this will be my third studio I&#x27;ve wired and with various other projects I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ve terminated maybe 600-700 cables in my &quot;career&quot;. I had to terminate about 60 cables for this one and I messed up 2. 
 From the audio wiring perspective I&#x27;ve probably terminated 6k balanced channels and I&#x27;ll mess up maybe 1 in 150ish. 
 My question is what the error rate would be for a professional installer, I&#x27;m guessing it would be 1 in 200ish but frankly I don&#x27;t have a clue. 
 Any edification would be much appreciated, also would be curious as to how long it took any of you to learn this skill.

                              <span>Potentially a daft question but which SFPQ modules and fibre would I use to connect a 544+FLR QSFP to the 40gb port on the nexus?
 Also is this normally what one would do? It’s for a storage server to a bunch of hypervisor for virtual disk storage.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I work at a small company. Recently, I have been tasked with setting up a VPN server so that employees can access certain company resources remotely. I contacted the ISP and requested a static IP address block. However, I am unsure how to respond to the ISP&#x27;s followup question about the configuration.
 For context, we are using CenturyLink/Lumen as the ISP and our hardware is part of the Unifi family. We originally planned to use an OpenVPN server, but recently discovered it was possible to run a VPN server directly on the Unifi hardware.
  
Your new LAN IP block is aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa/29 and it is statically routed to bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb. However, how would like us to configure the new IP block on the managed CPE, is there a specific interface you prefer for us to configure the new block on or statically route it to your LAN (Which next hop IP should we use) so you can use the whole /29 block?
  
What does &quot;interface&quot; mean in this context? Is this something on their end, or does this refer to our own hardware? Should I tell them to statically route the block to our LAN and provide the local IP address of our (network gateway? router?) as the next hop?
 I apologize if this is a stupid question, but our consultant has not been much help with this and I am a fish out of water here.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I work in a small business (just a bit bigger than mom-and-pop shops) and I have encountered an issue. We are expanding and have bought a building about 100 yards away for part of the office to move to. We have already installed a new modem/router from our ISP on a separate account and have it up and running. Now that the situation is explained I want to know the best way to go about this problem. 
 The people that are moving from building A into building B still need access to a shared file that is hosted on one of the windows computers. (not the way I would create a file-sharing system but it is what I have to work with.) The plan is to connect the network from building A to the new building B so they can access the locally shared file. I want to configure it so they can access the locally shared file on that network but the new ISP connection will handle all of the actual internet access. 
 Any help or recommendations would be appreciated. Feel free to ask about anything I left out.

Below is a copy of what I&#x27;ve written up in that period. If there are any mistakes or adjustments that need tweaking or adding to it, then please feel free to say.

 Electromagnetic radiation signals transmitted at certain nanometers are what allows for the use of different waves and rays (xray, UV, radio waves etc...) The lower the nanometer (on the right of the picture), the more energy that is outputted from the signal and can pass through certain objects (human skin/tissue, but not bones, such as xrays) to that fine a detail, and t…</span>

 Netgate 7100 - 120W while idle should be at 20W
 2 x Ubiquiti Switch - 60W with 600W (PoE), up to 660W per switch
 UNVR - 100W
 ​
 I would like to keep things running for approx 10 minutes. Any UPS recommendations? What should I consider when buying UPS?

 It&#x27;s just occurred to me that I never see anyone else do that, and I&#x27;m wondering if this is an obnoxious habit on my part. 
 It originated from dealing with some of the server folks or helpdesk folks seeming to imply I&#x27;m responding with &quot;it&#x27;s not the network&quot; without actually looking, so instead I prove I&#x27;m looking and showing them what I see to sort of &quot;nip in the bud&quot; any implication that I&#x27;m being dismissive, but now I do it out of habit. 
 Am I just an odd duck, or do some of you folks do that too?

                              <span>Has anyone ever used Netdisco with AES256 in SNMPv3? To my understanding it should support it just fine, but I cannot for the life of me get it to work with a cisco switch using AES256C. I don&#x27;t think we have any devices on our network that use 256 that aren&#x27;t cisco. 
 I can snmpwalk to that device successfully, and I have the same credentials configured within Netdisco (Which I believe USES the net-snmp library) but no luck at all no matter what I try. 
 Netdisco works great with our AES128 devices.
 Any tips on what I can try to get Netdisco to communicate to devices using AES256 or AES256C?

 I&#x27;m evaluating Cisco NCS540 to be used as backbone router, and I&#x27;d like to find how many ipv4/v6 routes it can install in its routing table. Can anyone help me? 
 I&#x27;ve looked into the original datasheet, in a cisco live presentation and looked for the chip specifications (Qumran-AX) but I rly couldn&#x27;t find what i need 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey All, 
 So I’m new to packet loss issues – this is my second network job but first time I’ve had to deal with it. So it seems like there is intermittent packetloss stemming from one specific device in our network… our Nexus 7706. At random times nodes all over our network stop responding and the common denominator is they are all patched to the 7706. They don’t all go down at once but when an event occurs you can be assured it’s patched to the nexus. It’s very random in both the time it happens as well as the devices it happens to – but again all uplinked to the 7706. 
 So my question is – where would I begin on troubleshooting this? Any real world advice here? This is where those damn ccna books do nothing for you… and unfortunately I’m a one man shop so I don’t have anyone to seek guidance from.

                              <span>I am configuring a 3900 from FS (first one I&#x27;ve purchased from them) and it will be used as a WAN switch sitting between the ISP equipment to share the connection to two firewalls in an HA config (active/standby). There is a second ISP that connects to the HA firewalls and the equipment from that ISP has multiple ports for WAN and a WAN switch isn&#x27;t needed on the second ISP link.
 It is a 24 port switch and I plan on using interfaces 1-12 for the WAN VLAN (to avoid using VLAN 1 and all 24 ports). I&#x27;ve already added the WAN VLAN and added those ports to that VLAN.
 The mgmt interface will be used for local access/configuration.
 Here are my questions (so far).
  
I&#x27;m going to confirm LLDP isn&#x27;t active on ports 1-12.
 I&#x27;d like to configure SNMP to only send data to my internal SNMP server. I&#x27;ve seen switches/network devices that have fields/commands to send SNMP data to specific servers, but I&#x27;ve also left those fields blank and I can still log into my NMS and pull SNMP data from the switch given I have the correct information.
  
I&#x27;m currently reading through the 3900 manual to confirm the LLDP and SNMP commands, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions that I may be missing to avoid leaking out data/information that should be avoided on the WAN side.
 Traditionally we&#x27;ve never done anything fancy to WAN switches, they are just L2 switches that we throw into the mix and we&#x27;ve also never had any management other than a local console cable IF a change needed to be made. Going forward, I&#x27;d like to change this and given that I have a local network port for management, I&#x27;d like to secure this switch the best way that I can.
 The default credentials have already been changed.
 Thanks.
 Edit- In other switches I&#x27;ve used, the management port is usually listed as out of band. I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case for this 3900 switch.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m experimenting with a Juniper SRX and it seems static routing isn&#x27;t as straight forward as it would be on a Cisco.
 I have my SRX connected to an L3 switch, with a network either side. On the L3 switch I&#x27;ve issued the static route command and set next hop as the Juniper interface that connects to the L3 switch.
 I added a static route in on the Juniper also, with next hop as L3 switch interface. However, when trying to ping from the Juniper network into the L3 network, my gateway comes back with destination net unreachable. In fact, when I logon to the Juniper over SSH, and try pinging the L3 switch interface, I get &quot;no route to host&quot; and when I look at the Juniper routing table, I see an entry for the L3 switch interface listed as a &quot;rejected&quot;.
 I read somewhere that you can&#x27;t simply add a static route onto a non point-to-point link on a Juniper. If that is the case, can someone explain how I can configure a basic static route on here?
 Many thanks

                              <span>I have a small mobile IOS router/switch device that is used for traveling clients. Essentially just a single site-to-site vpn back to an ASA, with a built in switch module. There is a single WAN interface where the crypto map is applied. This interface is public facing and is designed to be plugged into any commercially available IP (hotel, i.e. airport hotspot, etc) 
 We’re debating whats the better security practice on setting up controls on the WAN interface to only allow the IPSEC and ISAKMP traffic in. Is there any advantage or better practice to using ZBF on that port than just a simple inbound ACL that allows only those protocols though? Seems like the same end state from a security stand point

                              <span>This is a small segment of our network, so this is really just one of the VLANs. We have about 70 houses (and a business office, and a school, and ...) that share a single internet connection. All the VDSL modems connect and work well. They can talk to the router, 172.23.72.1 and to devices on the other VLANs (172.23.68.10 for example). However, they cannot talk to each other and I&#x27;m baffled.
 The DSLAM is a Huwai MA5600/MA5800 with 4 VDSL cards. Transparent VLAN setup in the DSLAM. Everything gets an IP address fine. Each DSL modem has a &quot;public, but private&quot; IP from our internal network and then does NAT for devices in that house.
 DSL A cannot talk to DSL B. I&#x27;d like to be able to put a server/NAS behind A and access it from B. Presently, if I have a server behind A I can only access it from other VLANs on the network or devices not connected to the DSLAM.
 Anyone have any ideas what I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hello, I have small business where there are two computers that are nowadays connected to 1Gbps switch that is plugged to the rest of the network. These two PCs would benefit from faster lan as they both work with the same data stored on one of those PC. The question is - can I add 10Gbps lan card to both and connect it directly without switch, while keeping the connected by 1Gbps switch? Or would this double connection intrferee? I don&#x27;t need faster connection to the rest of the network. I&#x27;m on tight budget, I was thinking about buying something like zyxel XGN100F (~150USD each) to both PC and premade optical cable (~20USD). Switch with two SFP ports would add ~180 USD that i would like to spare. Thanks!

                              <span>I figure if anyone knows about rack-mount enclosures, it&#x27;ll be you all. 
 I&#x27;m currently designing a 3U electrical box, and in the past have used these 19&quot; rack mount Hammond enclosures. However, for this project, I could really A. use the extra 4 inches and B. all the racks it&#x27;s being put into are 23&quot; anyways. I know Hammond (and others) have 23&quot; rack mount shelves... but I really need an enclosure. 
 Any chance I can have the best of both worlds? Thank you in advanced!

                              <span>We use pure DHCP relay on our network to assign addresses to subscribers. We have looked at using MAP-T in some new areas since our supported customer router supports it. Does anyone have any experience with MAP-T subscriber management? What solutions are there to automatically assign blocks of ports to subscribers using DCP. We have Infoblox and could script this type of thing, but I’d rather have a solution that just works out of the box.

 Could someone advice how to troubleshoot this error.

                              <span>I have a collapsed core in vss, and my L2 access switches are hanging off the collapsed core. The only L3 device is the collapsed core. I would like to separate some network from the global table using vrf lite. I want to start with the oob ports. I checked the Cisco docs but didn&#x27;t find how can leak routes between the global and vrf lite within the same collapsed core switch without sending the traffic to the next hop (provider). It is more like a inter-vlan but one of the SVIs is in global and the other is in vrf lite.
 Is there an easy and proper way of accomplishing what am trying to do?

                              <span>It was tough to come up with a title to sum up what I&#x27;m talking about but here are the details:
 We&#x27;ve got half a dozen offices and we are in the process of changing the WAN vlan at each one. Here&#x27;s a very simplified diagram of one site with a made up subnet:
 https://i.imgur.com/lIDZX3R.png
 Like I said, this is a very simplified diagram but the part in question is accurate. I used the green arrows to show how traffic is flowing from outside to the local LAN. During this change I&#x27;ve got a constant ping going to a host inside the local network from another location across the MPLS.
 The process is:
  
I ssh into the WAN switch from outside (MPLS)
 Select all 4 interfaces at once
 issue the access vlan command
  
At this point I lose anywhere between 5 and 10 pings and then the connection comes back up. Now, I&#x27;m reasonably certain that the lost pings are caused by something to do with the MAC address table on the switch but I&#x27;m not 100% and I&#x27;d really like to understand specifically what causes the brief disconnect. I started labbing this up in GNS3 but I quickly realized that the switch emulation isn&#x27;t good enough to accurately simulate this scenario.
 If this isn&#x27;t enough detail I&#x27;m happy to provide more in order to help identify what&#x27;s happening.

                              <span>We have an M365 group that is being used for office-wide communications. Some users complained that they are not receiving messages sent to the group (in their inbox). We discovered that some of them have changed their Follow in Inbox settings to the &quot;Only Replies to You and Events&quot; option. I found a way to force a setting change for members, whether they are subscribers or not, but nothing is stopping them from manually changing this setting gain the future. 
 Get-UnifiedGroupLinks $Group -LinkType Member | % {Add-UnifiedGroupLinks -Identity $Group -LinkType subscriber -Links $_.Guid.toString() -Confirm:$false} 
 Is there a way to permanently force a particular setting on a M365 group and prevent members from changing their setting?

                              <span>This is a rant
 I work as a security engineer for a MSSP, where in one of the projects i am responsible for identity security and PAM - i was almost burnt out and took some time off (a week)
 Yesterday was the first day off - and i start getting calls on what to do with this and that? By my clueless colleague. Who could have put some effort into learning crap… WHEN I WAS NOT ON LEAVE!!!
 I mean - you gotta hire if you want good talent and i am in no way an expert in what i do but man the dependencies 😒

 I don&#x27;t have a &quot;Registry&quot; option. All I have are &quot;Scripts&quot;, &quot;Security Settings&quot;, &quot;Folder Redirection&quot;, &quot;Policy-based QoS&quot;, and &quot;Deployed Printers&quot;:

 How do I deploy a registry entry to a GPO on my server? Can I somehow restore the &quot;Registry&quot; GPO option?

Below is a snippet from the email header with some name changes. It looks as though the message was relayed through an email service which allowed the impersonation but M365 only validated the SPF on the initial authenticated user&#x27;s domain.
 Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.

 Edit: We do not have any NT era devices. Some Linux appliances and Synology NAS. Everything is less then 10 years old

This is due to the proprietary pinout of APC Smart-UPS serial cables.
  
Today I needed a USB to serial cable for a switch&#x27;s console. That switch is on the other side of a huge building, so I wanted to test it before making the trek. I had found an old radioshack usb-serial adapter and plugged it into an inventory laptop, installed putty and went to the rack to look for a serial port to test it on. Ah ha! Look right here, an unused one on this UPS. Let us see... what&#x27;s that beeping... ... why is my phone ri... oh shit... zomg wtf really!?

                              <span>Spearphish attempt came as a fake reply to real e-mail that was several years old, from a vendor that had an email compromise.
 The attachment is a password protected zip with the password in message body and something about being unable to send the attachment otherwise (very true in this case).
 Extracted first payload contains large .htm which uses HTML smuggling to drop a second zip file with same password while putting up fake Office 365 page telling you how to open it.
 Second payload contains an .img file which mounts a filesystem and includes a .lnk shortcut to unleash the nastiness.
 From here everything is deeply obfuscated and resistant to being run in a sandbox. Proceeding any farther would require downloading payload files from the Internet and alerting the sender so this is where I stop for now. Even posting the filenames they use could leak information. I will say that the payload files all date from June to November 2021.
 The whole thing closely matches the technique described here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/
 So that&#x27;s fun.

We have now completed an exhaustive investigation and have not seen any threat-actor activity since October 26, 2022. During the course of our investigation, we have learned a great deal more about what happened and are sharing new findings today. Over the same period, we invested a significant amount of time and effort hardening our security while improving overall security operations. In today’s update, I’ll review those measures and highlight additional security steps that we are taking.

                              <span>So we have this guy that works... &quot;works&quot;... with us and we&#x27;ve noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don&#x27;t have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I&#x27;m working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn&#x27;t have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn&#x27;t really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don&#x27;t really have.
 So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it&#x27;s not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.
 NOTE: 1.) My boss can&#x27;t fire him, he&#x27;s been trying. 2.) He&#x27;s tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn&#x27;t work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as &quot;All you can do is talk to him.&quot;

                              <span>My company is pushing for certifications again; seems they aren&#x27;t as high as competitors are. Their solution? Tell people to go get certified at MS and they will reimburse for the exam fee.. for some certs... as long as its in your &quot;role&quot; (so Servers can go for Azure, Desktop for M365 and you cannot leave your lane), No time off to do them, its either during the 40-50 hours you are &quot;allocated&#x27; to a project or on your personal time. No reward for completion except a &quot;badge&quot; (ie congratulations email) if you complete several (&quot;its expected you complete training as part of your role&quot;).

 Anyone else in the same boat?

                              <span>So as the title says I believe that the company has lost all their data. There was a storm overnight that turned the power off for a while and when everyone came in this morning computers turned on like normal except the &quot;server&quot; (Win10 machine with all shared files on it). Basically the machine would not boot windows. Plugged the SSD into another computer and saw the data was RAW instead of NTFS. I have to format the drive in order to use the SSD again. They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren&#x27;t even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there&#x27;s an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they&#x27;re cheap and refused saying they&#x27;d do it on their own.
 Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V. SSD has Been sent to data recovery center

                              <span>I handle a corporation wherein we use Watchguard Fireboxes for the corporate office and all branch offices, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the power and granularity of the devices: they are not, however, cheap. Due to the CEO being married to an optometrist, I was asked to evaluate her office network...to call it a disaster would be kind. Now I apparently own IT for this office. :\ I need to get rid of the Netgear home router ASAP, and am initially inclined to use a Watchguard T25, but these are pretty pricey when hardware and license are included. Wondering what others have used that provides solid security with granular control?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I am about to buy a new laptop, for my job. My job consists of a basic office work, excel, word, outlook and little bit of graphic design, photoshop. In my free time, I like to play games, mostly Dota 2, warzone.
 So I started to look for a laptop, for office work. I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 € (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). 
 Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? 
 My best options I found on the web so far:
 Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,
 Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black 
 All of these are approximately 800€ (you can suggest different). Besides that, I am have a desktop PC at home, mid tier gaming machine, but sometimes I work from outside my home. I dont have any laptop right now.
 Thank you your replies, I appreciate all of the advices and shared experiences.

                              <span>We had a major power event at our main data center yesterday. Maintenance was being performed on our UPS, something went wrong and we lost all power to all of the racks including our production Nutanix cluster (5 hosts, ~120 running VMs) and our main backup repository (Dell Data Domain). I was shocked when we powered everything back up and there wasn&#x27;t a single data corruption issue (that we have found). In hindsight, I know I should have shut everything down gracefully ahead of time but they assurred me it was routine thing that they do all the time and it wouldn&#x27;t cause any issues. That should have been the red flag.
 The point of my story is....we&#x27;ve come a long way in recent years in terms of preventing data corruption. I remember a time when pulling the power on a SQL Server while running would almost certainly mean recovering databases from a backup. Chalk one up for progress.

Recently we hired a few guys, but they are directors title, mostly ask for project reports/ status or just talk, like get this done this week and get that done next week.
 At the end , still nothing much is getting done. We have 2,3 guys doing the work, and 2,3 guys project coordinator/ director, just keep asking for progress/ updates. I know project coordinator and those director title actually provides high level planning and decisions making functions! But still us needs to make things happen and get things done! The IT department head recently just told us , if no progress / updates with projects , will directly impact our performance reviews! So bad! what’s the issue there? What should I do? I feel like I work my ass off every week, busy with tasks here and there and daily operations tasks! I am quite new to sysadmin roles!

                              <span>Morning fellow nerds and geeks,
 I need some advice on my career trajectory. I&#x27;ve been working for a company for 10 years and I recently moved into a management slot overseeing our department. It&#x27;s a small shop, but a really good company and I was really enjoying it.
 Fast forward to a few weeks back, and we were bought out. It&#x27;s looking like I&#x27;m going to be back in a sys admin position. While it&#x27;s not terrible considering I have the same wage, seniority, and WFH, I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;ll hurt me moving back into a management slot. I&#x27;m concerned that the longer I&#x27;m out of the position, the harder it&#x27;ll be to move back up.
 What is your experience with this? Is my concern unfounded, or should I start looking again? We&#x27;ve not moved over to the new company just yet, but it looks like there&#x27;s no management slots available and likely won&#x27;t be for some time. The current staff have all been there for a long time and don&#x27;t look to be moving on anytime soon.

 I&#x27;m thinking:
 -just use a proxy to change ip and not draw attention by encrypting data?
 -set up laptop at friends house and just remote login to work?
 Any other options? Please help

                              <span>Hello! My parents have a business with a large variety of jackets in 3 different locations with over 1000 jackets. What I want to do is make a inventory system which can be accessed from each of those store locations using a barcode system with a barcode reader and a inventory software. 
 Simply my goal with this software is to see: - Quantity of a certain product by location - the sizes available of the product
 I dont need the software to be linked with the cash register.
 For example if a product is sold. I want to scan the barcode and decrease the quantity of how many of the products is left.
 Or the exact opposite. When new products arrive i want to print a barcode and stick it on the product and then enter it into the inventory system.
 I understand that for this i will need
  
multiple barcode scanners
 barcode printer
  
Have you guys ever worked with this type of software and also which software is the best and cheapest for this system.

                              <span>Hello. I have purchased 3x new ST8000VX0022
 But I wanted to verify they are working correctly before start building my raid 1
 So I planned this
 First I will do Long Sanitize Overwrite in SeaTools latest version
 Then I will do Long Generic Test read test
 If no errors that means drive is perfectly good
 Can we say that?
 Also started 3 disks Sanitize Overwrite and looks like gonna take 48 hours is this expected?
 In task manager i see some of the disks gets 100% then gets reduced and gets 100% again. randomly. not all the time 100% used.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I work for a mid-sized company of about 160 users.
 We&#x27;re currently looking for a secure web gateway kind of product. We previously ran a POC of Netskope, but this didn&#x27;t turn out very well for us. We&#x27;ve looked at other solutions such as Zscaler, Perimeter81 and Cloudflare One, but I&#x27;m curious to know what others have used in this space and how effective those products have been.
 The main things we are looking for are:
  
Filtering traffic(DNS, HTTP, Network based, etc..)
 Can provide some kind of secure access to non-public facing web apps.
 Has some kind of Malware filter for web traffic.
 Detects shadow IT usage. - Defender for cloud apps does some of this, but doesn&#x27;t seem super robust.
  
Thanks everyone.

                              <span>Not come across this issue before so hoping someone else has. I have a customer with an Epson 7830 printer but his laptop will not detect it via USB. 
 Printer works fine on other laptops, his laptop works with other USB devices, no AV or Firewall blocking it. The only thing I noticed is it once said low USB power when I initially started troubleshooting so I got a powered USB dock but no joy. Also tried various USB cables.
 Just wondered if anyone had any thoughts? I&#x27;ve sent the laptop to Dell but it&#x27;s come back saying USB ports are fine (which I assumed).

 I would like to stop using AD admins for logging on to systems - for this I would like to create an AD group that will be set up via GPO as local admin on our servers&amp;clients.
 Even though there are no admins that are only assigned to certain areas - does it still make sense to create one AD group for clients and one for servers + 2x individual users that can either access all servers or clients as local admin?

                              <span>My company is looking into buying a monitoring and reporting service with basically the feature set of MXTOOLBOX.
 Blacklist monitoring and alerting, SPF, DNS, DKIM and DMARC Checks (+RUF) and so on.
 But as mxtools, dmarcly and so on are from outside of Europe, my company isn&#x27;t keen to buy non-GDPR compliant services ( and our procurement apparently doesn&#x27;t want to get into international payments...). 
 Long story short - my research wasn&#x27;t really successful, so here&#x27;s my question to you: Are you aware of any such email security service hosted in Europe?

                              <span>Hi all,
 My team has recently expanded from a couple of people to a much larger group. We now need to securely store some passwords and logons that the team collectively need, eg for accessing administration websites. I am looking for a suitable piece of software (Win Server) or website that would allow us to store these securely and ensure access for the team, while allowing us to grant / restrict access to specific individuals. Ideally this would be cheap, or free, as we are education/public sector.
 TIA

 I have the problem that the Windows 11 Click-Here-To-Upgrade keeps displaying in Windows Update. 
 A GPO is active with the setting &quot;Select the target Feature Update version&quot; set to 21H2. The GPO gets applied to the laptop. In the registry I can see that it correctly shows the target build, but the Windows 11 upgrade message stays.
 Any idea&#x27;s? Thanks.

                              <span>Hey guys, I apologize because it&#x27;s probably a dumb question but im new in the sysadmin world (started the apprenticeship earlier this year) and was tasked by my boss to implement an app called Make Me Admin (https://github.com/pseymour/MakeMeAdmin) into our Azure and write a powershell script that, when executed, would install it and also change the setting of the app to grant the user admin rights for 60 minutes instead of the default 10 minutes.
 On the github page OP said to change values one has to go to
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin 
 But after installing the app, that key does not appear in that path (or any other path), so do I have to create it manually?
 I also wrote some PS code to create the key if its not there with my veeery limited PS syntax knowledge and some AI, but it also doesnt seem to work. While it does install the app (if its in the same directory as the script for now), it does not create the key.
 $software &#x3D; &quot;MakeMeAdmin 2.3.0 x64.msi&quot; $msiPath &#x3D; Join-Path $PSScriptRoot $software if (Test-Path $msiPath) { Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList &quot;/i &#x60;&quot;$msiPath&#x60;&quot; /quiet /passive&quot; if (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ProductFilter -Filter &quot;Name&#x3D;&#x27;$software&#x27;&quot;) { Write-Output &quot;&#x27;$software&#x27; is installed.&quot; # Create the MakeMeAdmin key if it does not exist if (!(Test-Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin&quot;)) { New-Item -Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\&quot; -Name &quot;MakeMeAdmin&quot; -Force | Out-Null } # Set the AdminRightTimeout value to 60 minutes New-ItemProperty -Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin&quot; -Name &quot;AdminRightTimeout&quot; -Value &quot;60&quot; -PropertyType DWORD -Force } else { Write-Output &quot;&#x27;$software&#x27; NOT installed.&quot; } } else { Write-Output &quot;MSI package &#x27;$software&#x27; not found.&quot; } 
 Sorry if the post sounds confusing, I am lost myself rn haha

                              <span>Hi there,
 Please bare with me as my windows admin experience is nonexistent. At the corp. I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.
 So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP&#x27;s so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP&#x27;s just results in the run around. 
 Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?
 I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.
 ​
 Many thanks

                              <span>Heyho fellow Sysadmins,
 we are using a Slack-App to do our permission management. The user fils a short form, a superior and myself accept the form &amp; then I set the permissions manually on our Domain Controller (which is a Synology NAS). 
 So now I want to get this automated. The goal would be to only hit the &quot;accept&quot; button in the slack-app and the permission for the user get set automatically and also get removed after a set date.
 I don&#x27;t really know how to do this technically.
 Maybe you have an idea or direction on how to achieve this, so I can do some further research. :)

 No issues turning DKIM on for domain.mail.onmicrosoft.com but when turning this on for custom domain I just receive &quot; CNAME record does not exist for this config.&quot;
 Should this even be on for the domain.com domain?
 LearnDMARC states:

 &quot;I see you&#x27;ve included a DKIM signature.
 I couldn&#x27;t retrieve the public key from selector1-saundersarchitects-onmicrosoft-com._domainkey.saundersarchitects.onmicrosoft.com and verify the signature. The Auth Result is invalid. &quot;

 I had just assumed that MS did MFA like everyone else with paired app TOTPs and therefore the option to use 3rd party with apps
 Just heard about number matching and enforcement imminent
 I tried the MS auth app w number matching and user experience was aweful. Also it forced me to register my private device to the company, something I can’t expect of users.
 User base is low tech low paid shift work care staff. This needs so be SIMPLE
 I’ve been rolling out SF MFA this last year to different orgs and it’s a breeze.
 Can someone give me some pointers? Also willing to pay an hour or two to help determine my MFA strategy.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m preparing to setup Linux VM deployment for our application team, the goal is to setup a basic VM via template and then deploy the OS and all standard configurations automatically.
 The distros will vary, depending on the requirements, but overall they will deploy Ubuntu (22.04 or 20.04) and RHEL (probably 9, maybe 8).
 For lifecycle management like updates and config changes we will probably be using Ansible, but how could I automate the deployment process across those distributions?
 I am aware of kickstart, but afaik this is a Fedora/RHEL based tool, would it be possible to deploy Ubuntu as well?
 I&#x27;m asking this, because Ubuntu has it&#x27;s own deployment tools, if I get this right, which is Autoinstall/Cloud-Init, and I would prefer to use only one method for both distros.
 What would be the best approach to this, otherwise?
 I&#x27;m sorry if something seems unclear, I&#x27;m pretty new to linux administration (dipping into it right now)
 All answers appreciated!

 My boss asked me to remove all local admin users from the domain. Doesn&#x27;t seem too hard so that&#x27;s going to be easy. The hard part is supporting the users which have the local admin accounts.
 Some users need to change their IPv4-Address to work with servers. I fixed this with the local group Windows 10 has which is called &quot;Network Configuration Operators&quot;. All users which need to change their IPv4 Address are automatically added in this Group via a Group Policy.
 Now I wanted to know if I can do the same thing with allowing users to create bootable USB-Drives and give them the permission to partition USB-Disk Partitions. 
 I checked the builtin Windows 10 groups but didn&#x27;t find a group which could enable this. Maybe someone can help me with this?
 Thanks in advance!
 Sorry for my bad english, english isn&#x27;t my first language.

                              <span>Hey All, We have a few Brother PTE550W that we use for asset tags, general labels, etc. We love the labelers, they work well, charge lasts a long time, labels last on devices etc.
 Any tips on designing them in P-Touch editor and getting the alignment to keep when transferring them to the labeler templates for use on the device? We can use the software or the app, but it&#x27;s so nice when it does work that you can just enter in a pre-set field or two and it prints the same everytime.
 For a simple two line label, with two &quot;titles&quot; the alignment never lines up.
 I know some of you guys use p-touch so thought I&#x27;d ask before I pull my hair out over a darn labeler.

                              <span>Hello /networking! 
 I&#x27;ve been fighting the classic &quot;no internet&quot; globe at our primary location for 2 years. It seems to rear it&#x27;s ugly head every 6-10 months and of course this Monday was a classic explosion of multiple computers not allowing Outlook to function even though the internet was connected. I&#x27;ve spent hours...nay days on this. 
 Our standard fix has been:
  
&#x60;sfc /scannow&#x60; &#x60;DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth&#x60; [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet] EnableActiveProbing set to 1 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] NoActiveProbe set to 0 &#x60;[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] DisablePassivePolling set to 1 restart computer 
  
I finally realized that an nslookup with &quot;server 131.107.255.255&quot; to any request fails...pcap shows no response from the server what-so-ever. Confirmed the traffic is being passed by the firewall and no clear blocks from anti-virus. 
 I can do a DNS request all day from other networks and IPs. I have access to a number of sites and all of them respond instantly to a dns query to the classic nds.msftncsi.com IP. Any recommendations on how to find out if MS is blacklisting my primary site IP? Who/how do I contact Microsoft regarding this?
 The above fixes have worked previously but of course today, something has changed and 3 computers continue to not function even after the fixes. I do not have IPv6 running on this network. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks for any rabbit holes I may not have run down. This has me frustrated and stumped. I think the fact that DNS isn&#x27;t responding is my smoking gun but I don&#x27;t know how to take it to the next level.

 If the LB sandwich is so popular how are all the people using it out there handling their AD and kerberos? I don&#x27;t actually know.
 Can you all enlighten me to your general setups when it comes to NVAs and authentication? Thanks.

                              <span>My fellow Redditors,
 I am redistributing BGP from my router into an OSPF process located in a VRF (Area 1). My router is connected to the Neighbor Router via Area 1. Area 1 is configured as a stub area. 
 My understanding of a stub area is that it blocks Type 5 LSAs. I am redistributing into the OSPF process that includes the stub area. Since my path would be BGP -&gt; OSPF (Backbone Area 0) -&gt; OSPF Area 1 (VRF) -&gt; Neighbor Router (Area 1), does the Stub router located in OSPF Area 1 deny the Type 5 LSA coming via the Backbone area? 
 My understanding is that a Stub Area does not allow an ASBR to exist within it. My router that is redistributing BGP -&gt; OSPF would be considered an ASBR. However, since I&#x27;m going from OSPF Area 0 to OSPF Area 1 in a VRF, does the VRF act as an ABR (and not an ASBR) thereby allowing the Stub area to receive the type 5 LSA?
 I understand the simple solution is to configure the Neighbor Router as a NSSA. However, this may not be a possibility. 
 Am I overthinking this? It is as simple as I am coming from BGP -&gt; OSPF and the Stub Area prevents that type 5 LSA from entering it (VRF or not)?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been working on a project that involves taking the existing network of 192.168.1.0, splitting it up into VLANs and creating additional VLANs to allow for a Data Network and Voice Network. I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.
 My configuration is as follows:
 ASA
 int g1/1 - Outside
 int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)
 route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 
 Core Switch
 vtp mode server
 int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)
 switchport access to vlan 10
 int vlan 10
 ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 80
 ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 90
 ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 
 ip routing is enabled 
 So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found so far:
 I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN
 I can&#x27;t ping the other way around
 DHCP is working. I&#x27;m able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.
 I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x
 I can&#x27;t ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks 
 There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Does any one know of any good open standard or general best practice guides for all things networking? I have several documents from vendors, but am looking for more general/not vendor specific material to read up on. Currently work as an entry level engineer at an MSP and am trying to provide a little more value when doing health checks/reviews on customer environments. I am guessing a lot of it just comes with experience, but I’m always being asked about best practice design/architecture, configuration, etc. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am trying to set up a complex system using a cisco nexus with full routing enabled. I need to have two VRFs set up for regulations requirements. I need to get 4 networks on the switch run through 2 vrfs out two physical interfaces up to the firewall where Policy can handle it and let things go out to the internet. I am having trouble actually configuring it.
 The basic set up is kind of like this: 
 VR-Office
 vlan 12
 10.10.12.0/22
 10.10.12.1 gateway 
 vlan 16
 10.10.16.0/24
 10.10.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/1 ip add 172.16.16.129 #the far end will have an add of 16.130 
 VR-Accounting
 vlan 112
 10.20.12.0/22
 10.20.12.1 gateway 
 vlan116
 10.20.16.0/24
 10.20.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/2 ip add 172.16.16.133 #other side will have address 16.134 
 I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.
 The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. 
 I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. 
 Am I misunderstanding anything? Would anyone be willing to explain how this might look in a L2/L3 router&#x27;s config? I feel like I am missing something simple.

                              <span>Now that encrypted DNS is becoming more common and Android is supporting this by default a question I believe is very stupid just popped in my mind. TLS certificates require domain names to work so DNS over TLS only works if you provide a hostname instead of an IP address, but if the device is connecting to a network for the first time and the DHCP server only provides the hostnames for the DNS servers then how is the device going to resolve the hostname to connect to the DNS server in the first place? Also, what if I&#x27;m connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option? What is the best way to proceed?

                              <span>Hubs, not switches. We have a site where we need to mirror all traffic in/out of the firewall to a switch port, so it be processed by a security appliance. The issue is that the main switch (Ubiquity) only allows mirroring of one port. This would be fine, except that I have redundant firewalls, with automatic fail over. The second FW is connected to another port on the switch.
 My thought was to put a HUB between the firewalls and the main switch, then plug the monitor into that.

Engenius&#x27;s marketing materials indicate that they can be operated in a &#x27;standalone&#x27; mode without a controller, but it&#x27;s not clear to me if the standalone mode is basically the same UX and per-AP features that you&#x27;d get with the managed options, or if the standalone mode is basically the same as the older EnSky user interface.

                              <span>We mostly have cisco, but still have some Junipers in the wild. Before coming here, 0 experience with Juniper. Anyways, I making a change and trying understand what the functional difference (if any) is between these two commands. 
 set interfaces ae8 native-vlan-id 1 set interfaces ae6 unit 0 family ethernet-switching native-vlan-id default 
 After doing some reading, I think it&#x27;s just the difference in setting that actual ae8 interface to native vlan 1, whereas the second command is setting the logical ae6.0 interface to native vlan default which on this switch is also vlan ID 1. So vlan default &#x3D; vlan 1. Wouldn&#x27;t each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?
 The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don&#x27;t know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing. I feel it has something to do with the above commands.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 we have been running our GGC for some years now, and it gives a pretty constant 1:3 bandwidth saving. We just got our Akamai appliances and I&#x27;m curious how much that will be, probably higher peaks but less consistency. As we don&#x27;t have private customers directly Netflix has not been interesting for now, but I could see huge savings on networks with many private customers.
 ​
 Which appliances are you running and how much Bandwidth do they save for you?

 Would there be an issue with assigning 2 IPs to the internal server for the tunnel, one of those just to be the routing IP?

My Google-Fu is failing me on this one.

                              <span>We have been using Nautobot to document and automate out network, and I&#x27;ve come across a use case that I dont think it caters for. We are about to deploy out first WDM campus network, making use of OADMs to split out specific colours along the fibre path. As far as I can tell, Nautobot doesn&#x27;t cater for WDM usage on a fibre path.
 So 2 questions.. is there a way to make it work in Nautobot? If not, what are you using to record and document your WDM deployments and what do you like and dislike about it?

                              <span>We are currently in a proof-of-concept phase for building a centralized network infrastructure for 32 schools, all connected to two datacenters where all servers and core network components will be placed. Our customer has access to Alcatel-Lucent switches with a significant discount. My last experiences with Alcatel were not the best, with them being tedious and slow to configure, but that was about 12 years ago. We primarily use Cisco and Dell for core and access switches these days and I am currently thinking about sticking to what we know best or just going with Alcatel to save money. We are planing to use stacked 48 Port 1G PoE Switches as access switches and 48 Port 25G switches witch MLAG as core switches.
 What are your thoughts and experiences with Alcatel?
 Features that are important for us (apart from stability and support of course):
  
configuration through a CLI interface which can be automated with ansible
 stacking for access switches, MLAG for core switches
 a solid 802.1X implementation with multi-host support

                              <span>Hello Everybody
 We use Sophos for our AV and MTR
 Currently running around 50,000 per year based on last year&#x27;s renewals. It doesn&#x27;t come up until October.
 95% of our users already have Micrsoft E3 licenses which includes defender. 
 Its currently disabled in Intune.
 Would using Defender + Huntress ( Managed Cybersecurity Platform for SMBs and IT Providers | Huntress ) be a good replacement?
 We already use Micrsoft E3s plus a few E5s.
 The users that have business basic don&#x27;t use computers anyway. 
 Am I stupid for thinking of using Defender and not Sophos

                              <span>We can&#x27;t create Windows images on drives not formatted in NTFS. But you can transfer a completed image from an NTFS drive to, let&#x27;s say, a portable exFat formatted drive. Would this somehow break a Windows image once it&#x27;s time to be used?
 FYI, the images I&#x27;m creating are from the control panel --&gt; backup and restore (Windows 7) --&gt; create a system image.
 Edit: My concerns is about corrupting the image because of storing it or transferring the it to non-NTFS formatted storage. I&#x27;m not trying to install the image on a non-NTFS drive.

We want to segment internal access for admins, operations, developers through the use of a VPN solution with MFA and zero trust them based on AD group membership. The problem I am seeing that it doesn’t scale to well as 100’s of users wil need access to multiple environments and the reconnecting and reauth to these diff environments is becoming problematic. Any ideas how to solve this?

There are several things that would be super helpful from setting up MFA to pointing them in the direction of SharePoint, sending them to our quick cyber security reminders video, etc. I could always create a batch file or something with a script flag and send them to a checklist or SharePoint communication site. Just wondering if there’s something more “elegant”.

                              <span>I work as a global engineer for a pretty massive company. We have several different domains spanning across the globe. Im currently wanting to reign that management in some. I absolutely want individual admins to retain full management of their sites. But not be able to go outside of their realm. Many of these sites are OUs under a domain, so domain admin gives full reign across enterprise level organization. Right now, it&#x27;s a real cluster f.
 Im looking at a few different products that will allow us to centrally manage AD and Group Policy using a more delegated approach and added auditing. Pulling away from traditional AD tools and bringing things home to a central interface. 
 I would love to hear some suggestions from other admins on what they are using or have used, pros and cons.

                              <span>When building a home-lab, I really wanted it look like an actual realistic network that an SMB was utilizing. This site was quite helpful, but I discovered that I had a hard time coming up with fake users, fake documents, and the like to make it actually look like an internal company network that was in use.
 Whilst doing this, I thought to ask ChatGPT for some help on the matter, and the results were quite helpful. I gave the prompt:
  
I&#x27;m trying to learn how to become a sys-admin, in order to do this I&#x27;m creating a homelab in VMware, I want this homelab to be a realistic simulation of an SMB, please generate some fake, but reasonable information about this fictional SMB that I&#x27;m emulating for training purposes. 
  
It gave me some excellent data that would likely take me forever to think of on my own. It included names of employees, their good/bad passwords, company details like location and size, it even gave me data about the technology they used!
 I&#x27;ve seen people use ChatGPT for writing scripts or fixing problems, but with dubious accuracy. Alot of the solutions are good, but it seems about half of them contain some manner of issues and inaccuracies. However, it seems that ChatGPT&#x27;s excellence in making up BS can actually be used for good!
 EDIT: Let it be known that ChatGPT&#x27;s accuracy is sometimes a bit better than half, but in all fairness I wouldn&#x27;t trust it enough to justify some peoples uses for it. Although generating reasonable, but fake information seems to have a 100% chance of working.

                              <span>I recently made the jump from an organization that really didn&#x27;t value IT. We were a necessary evil but IT wasn&#x27;t something that the company liked to spend money on. We were running on shoestring budgets and poor leadership. We were expected to move mountains and were in constant fire fighter mode. 
 The new organization is much more mature and more resourced. The IT team appears to be at least 10 times the size of the previous company. Everything is organized, automated and cutting edge. There are clear expectations and IT appears to be highly regarded by the leadership team. 
 My initial reaction was feeling like there is nothing for me to do at the new company since there aren&#x27;t any burning fires to put out but I realized that this new environment and change in culture offers me time to actually grow. I can actually focus and learn new things rather than run from one problem to another. 
 Just wondering how others have gone through this experience. My hope is that I will be able to really level up in the new role.

                              <span>Hi all. I work in a company that has a sort of startup offshoot that has been left to its own devices for two years. The offshoot is meant to be dynamic and tech-driven whereas the original is less experimental and is where the IT department sits.
 The whole split has been poorly managed from the start and about a year ago one of the seniors set up an AWS account, gave a group of us the keys and admin rights and then resigned. Since then, we&#x27;ve built out a set of automation tools and apps. Over time, I&#x27;ve tried to take over system administration and have focused on learning about its security. I know how to use SSM manager to avoid the use of permanent keys for VM access, I can control all user abilities from IAM and set MFA, servers exist in security groups with restricted IP addresses an…</span>

                              <span>I enjoying tech and computers, and can’t really imagine myself doing anything besides tech, but I’m a little worried. It seems like literally every single person I see that’s been in the industry for several years wants to quit and go live on a farm.
 Anyone year who’s been working for 10+ years and still enjoys it? Do you still like learning about new stuff and working on a homelab and what not?
 It’s also weird cause so many of those folks that work non-tech jobs like farming end up wanting to learn to code and switch to a desk job after 10 years.

Ive tried the intel rapid storage driver and some nvme or sata ones but it cant seem to load any. In the bios its set to AHCI and proper usb boot support, the nvme and sata drive wont show up. Does anyone have an idea what i could try? Im thinking about trying to install w10 or 11 and try to export the drivers through powershell but im not that sure whether WS2019 would take those drivers.

It was all good until this acl list and wildcards. I didn&#x27;t understand anything after subnet masks and cidrs. Can someone someone point me to a place that simply explains ACL lists ,wildcards and ZPF ?
 Also , am i doing it wrong ? should i be studying something else than those courses during my free time ?Additionally what certifications/exams should i take or plan to do that&#x27;ll help towards a cyber sec career ?
 I&#x27;m kinda clueless about those so any and all feedback is much appropriated.Thanks in advance and have a nice day :)

                              <span>Wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction here, I need to get the PST of a mailbox from an exchange server (cloud hosted by a 3rd party) so I can get copy of mail, contacts, cal, etc. The issue is autodiscover / DNS is set to the new exchange (Microsoft 365) so cant get access to the old mail.
 Is there a way like with IMAP accounts I can get it to point to the &quot;old&quot; exchange server? I have tried the old autodiscover with the IP Address in hosts file then adding account on same machine but still points to new exchnage (M365)?
 Any ideas? We dont have access to old exchnage so trying to do without contact, I do have the old DNS settings for autodsicover (autodiscover.xd.email)

                              <span>Have worked for myself for quite some time now and so my CV is very out of date, thought I&#x27;d go through and freshen it up/rewrite it and I&#x27;m just curious how the managers and others involved in hiring here would differentiate between a &quot;good&quot; and an &quot;excellent&quot; CV? 
 I&#x27;m talking from perspective of the UK but I guess same applies elsewhere so all answers welcome.

I have a number of the users who are saving things into the library but the documents are only staying machine side and not appearing in the cloud, onedrive continues to sync fine for these users, it&#x27;s just the sharepoint library its stopped doing but the client isn&#x27;t showing any errors....

                              <span>Hello all,
 I was wondering if anyone had advice for software for scanning a network for live devices.
 I currently use advanced IP scanner but it doesn’t placate pull through users. The company I work for is actively trying to reduce our electricity by having users power down on a Friday. It’s not happening though as on Monday mornings they don’t like waiting, when I run advanced up scanner it tells me machine names etc but not always the users. 
 Sadly My predecessors didn’t keep note of machine names and who they went to so it would take ages to sit and go through things.

                              <span>Hi, after 2 years as help desk junior sys admin i finally got a real sys admin job. Since i worked only in one shop before i am not certain what i should expect/check at new job. Maybe someone could tell what are the first things i should check there besides documentation and backups? Not looking for detailed guides just some simple outlines what is important. They running AD infrastructure, ubuntu dev servers, veeam, O365.
 Thanks in advance fellow admins!

                              <span>Hi, our company in the sublimated custom Apparel business. We currently uses a very heavily Customized version of Dynamic AX and we&#x27;d like to upgrade to a new ERP system that replicates as much of this as possible so we don&#x27;t have to maintain and import all of our customizations.
 A lot of emphasis on the features and input process for Sales Orders to make it easy to input with huge numbers of size/color/fabric and customization variations.
 And also to manage the many stages that are involved in creating the custom apparel for the people involved in actually producing them at each stage.
 We also have a lot of custom reports, so it would be great to have a good BI system, separate data warehouse so that running reports doesn&#x27;t affect performance of the main system.
 We are about 300 employees and growing.

                              <span>I run a lab of 32 computers. I used to use DEEP FREEZE in another lab setting. The functionality I liked was being able to THAW and FREEZE computers whenever I need to change any software or install an updates. That&#x27;s really all I need to do, I don&#x27;t need to do any monitoring or anything like that as I use Veyon.
 I am looking to a easy to use alternative that is hopefully open source, but my search results are all turning up kaput. I see a lot of talk about group policies and temporary accounts. I&#x27;m not too verse on those. Right now the lab is set up as 32 bare metal computers with an admin and a student account. We are constantly adding software that is beneficial for us, but students are also finding ways to circumvent and install other bloatware applications which is why I am looking for a Deep Freeze alternative, any suggestions?

                              <span>Need help with a recommendation for a Network visibility and monitoring tool. I don&#x27;t need anything fancy and expensive like Logic Monitor. All I want is a simple tool that does the following. 
  
 Show all the endpoints on my network
  Discover newly added devices and Rogue devices
 Send email alerts 
 Topology map
 Customizable dashboard
  
Thank you

                              <span>Has anyone ever been able to find any part-time consulting ,engineering or teaching gigs? I have about 7 years of experience in the field and I have my CCIE:Routing and Switching and have spent the past few years focusing on network programmability and SDN.
 I really love networking so I have been looking at any opportunities that I could do additionally to my full time job. I have looked into Upwork but I cannot get my profile approved because they say the market is saturated. I honestly don&#x27;t really care about the pay, i&#x27;d even look into doing consulting as volunteer work if there were any opportunities around. I appreciate any help!

                              <span>One of the things I’ve been tinkering with lately is FRR. Really impressed with the features, along with the CLI.
 Just about any routing feature I’d need is present, not to mention the performance is pretty impressive.
 One of the things I don’t see in FRR’s documentation, and this was confirmed by some of the FRR devs as well, is there’s no Netflow/IPFIX/Sflow capabilities.
 Obviously FRR is intended to be a routing suite, and that’s understandable, but has anyone here using FRR found a library for this purpose on Debian that is actively maintained and has enough flexibility to be considered viable for being used alongside FRR?

                              <span>Hey Folks, 
 Just curious on how everyone running older equipment…or Cat9200s…supporting auto-install mode are doing ZTP with DHCP. Specially in regards to DHCP scopes where native VLANs don’t exist.
 At all of our locations everything is tagged and a defunct/unused native VLAN is used.
 And idea I had was to create a small network just for the ZTP configuration on the branch router and then just abandon it afterwards.
 Curious how everyone else does it?

                              <span>Hey all.
 My office is in the process of moving to VoIP from a ~20 year old PBX. 
 The patch panels in the PBX room look not dissimilar to these. https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fek38o/this_cable_management_in_a_hospital_server_room
 Due to COVID &amp; WFH we have a combination of new staff who have never been in the building &amp; have new numbers &amp; people who can&#x27;t remember where their desk was let alone what the extension on it was, so as we move people across in trying to strip the lines back. 
 Looking for any tips, tricks or recommendations to help trace out individual lines though the tangled mess of 20 years of moves.
 I have a fluke toner but found that the 48v on the surrounding live lines generates to much noise to be usable ☹️

                              <span>Does anybody know the difference between the Miller CFS-3 and the Miller FO 103-T please?
 (This is for prepping cable for fusion splicing).
 They both appear to be 3-hole fiber optic strippers, and from the specs I can see, they strip the same diameters.
 Is one newer or older than the other?
 Does anybody have any personal preferences, with any reasons between these?
 (I saw Knipex also makes some fiber optic strippers - Knipex 12 82 130 SB and Knipex 12 85 110 SB, however, there don&#x27;t seem to be many reviews for them, and I assume they&#x27;re not as well known as the Miller gear)

                              <span>So recently I was asking a question about how to fix Grub if I&#x27;m installing Windows after Ubuntu. I found the solution. But now I want to ask about aftermaths of boot-repair. So, my system was working like this before:
  
Ubuntu with Grub
 Windows on hdd
  
So what I did is I unplugged every drive, I installed Windows on new m2 ssd, connected old hdd (where my old windows was located), transfered all data and formatted hdd so it&#x27;s now just a storage for windows. Then I connected ssd with my ubuntu and run boot-repair from my usb flash. After that grub got fixed and I can choose between new Windows and Ubuntu, and it&#x27;s all working.
 But one thing that bothers me is that there&#x27;s still old Windows left on grub menu, even tho I formatted old hdd with Windows. Also in UEFI there were added more options to boot from, like ubuntu (m2 ssd) and ubuntu (hdd) even tho ubuntu is not installed there at all. I have the logs from boot-repair saved, if they&#x27;re safe to share, I can share them. Also I can screenshot my partitions if it&#x27;s needed, just tell me what to run, I&#x27;m not a pro in such things, and it seems like no-one in other communties can help me (I asked this question many times), so please don&#x27;t delete the question, because last time I asked here something, it got deleted even tho it didn&#x27;t violate any rules, but I was lucky enough to get the answer before it got deleted, so I came here again, as my last hope, not trying to violate anything.
 My question is, should I be worried about something? Or it&#x27;s not of a big deal and I can forget about it? It also says when I&#x27;m booting to Ubuntu &quot;failed to set APST feature&quot; and something starts going on, and eventually it loads after a little time and works fine, new Windows on m2 ssd works fine too.

                              <span>This is a very long Rant post. But I need somewhere to spit it out and ask for advice. Thanks for reading.
 TL:DR. I&#x27;ve been a sysadmin for four years now. We have no endpoint management, no ticket systems, nothing. I don&#x27;t even have access to email administration. Employees ignore documentation, instructions, security rules. The supervisor and CEO doesn&#x27;t want to implement anything or respond to it in any way. How do I convince CEO to give permission to do something?
 I joined this company four years ago. Before that, I did user and equipment support in the catering industry. As well as various personal projects.
 From the very beginning, I started out as a helpdesk and &quot;equipment supply manager&quot; and I had almost none of the access I needed to do my job and some that I absolutely didn&#x27;t n…</span>

 External hard drive bay connected with usb 3.0 with smb server
 Over wifi (5ghz network) connection getting 30-35MB (from laptop to smb server)
 When transfering file internally inside smb server getting 120 - 130 MB transfer speed beetwen two hard drive.
 My concern is how can i achieve atleast 120MB file transfer speed from laptop to smb server.
 What speed i can get highest? Over wifi and over ethernet?
 Update:
 Router is Tenda AC15 AC1900 802.11ac
 From feature: ac speed of up to 1900Mbps, delivering both 1300Mbps 802.11ac at 5GHz and 600Mbps 802.11n at 2.4 GHz concurrently.
 And laptop wifi 6 supported.

 - inefficient processes without management buy-in to change
 - IT is overworked, skipping lunches, working late.
 Would love to hear from sysadmins who work only 40hrs a week without any pushback. I&#x27;m done with skipping lunch breaks to put out fires and working late. The problem is the rest of my team does that, so I may look like a slacker for going home on time.
 How do you communicate these boundaries?

 Something so ridiculous happened at the IT firm I am working at, that I can&#x27;t even...
 I and 3 other senior devs were recruited at one IT firm in December along with one junior dev - all fine so far (all of us are working remotely). We were just doing some basic stuff, like bug fixing as the development of the new product is supposed to start in march and a month ago there was a first onsite party taking place, unfortunately, I and 3 other devs could not join ( I was getting married that day) and only junior dev went. During the onsite party, apparently, this junior dev got to know our product owner ( the person who recruited us) VERY WELL ( the idiot confessed that they slept together). And last week we received the news that this JUNIOR DEV will be our technical lead. Me and othe…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I work in IT for a company that has in the last few months been plagued by an update that has made it so nearly every computer we own now auto-locks after 2-5 minutes. We have opened up a support ticket with Microsoft and they deny anything is wrong, but other companies have agreed with us that this is new and is affecting them as well.
 To try and bypass this new &quot;feature&quot; we have tried: 
  
rolling back the update - Didn&#x27;t work
 modifying power plan settings - didn&#x27;t work 
 Power plan advanced settings - didn&#x27;t work
 
 Windows settings - didn&#x27;t work
 Various registry edits - didn&#x27;t work*
 Disabling Windows Dynamic Lock (this is normally disabled by our policy anyway, but that&#x27;s a whole other story) - didn&#x27;t work
 Disabling Dell Optimiser on computers that have it - Didnt work
  
There are no settings in our Azure AD tenant, group policy, or on-prem domain that pertain to screen saver and screen lock timers
 * we did find a registry key that disables the computer&#x27;s ability to lock entirely (including using Win+L), but this poses a security issue for obvious reasons and so we aren&#x27;t going this route. 
 So far the only thing I have found was earlier today when I was working on this issue is that my windows screen saver settings auto default back to five minutes even after changing the settings AND modifying the registry key to set the screen saver up to 15 minutes.
 I also found that my computer&#x27;s screen will lock after 2 minutes but when I boot in safe mode it goes. up to 5. 
 We now have upper management breathing down our necks because everyone is complaining about this issue and the CIO is trying to fend everyone off the best they can while we figure this out but nothing is working.
 Does anybody have ANY ideas because we&#x27;re at wits end here.

 What can I start doing now to prep myself to be in that role? I am currently learning new things I have never been exposed to before such as some project planning, working more directly with vendors, and handling my first e-rate project. 
 Books, podcasts, real life advice will all be appreciated.

 What is more interesting is that I can create a policy with predefined rules, but when i want to edit it, it ends with the same error.

 It&#x27;s this above just error? Or I really need E5 for that?

L&amp;TT reports no issues with the health of the drive or tape. I&#x27;ve had this same issue with PreRollPost, Iperius, and copying with file explorer. Is this normal?

                              <span>I need to get a new AD install going, but all our ESX hosts are 7+ years old and won&#x27;t install.
 I have quotes from people from using KVM to VMware, but I can&#x27;t get funding for a completely new VM system. (Was quoted $45k-150K depending on vendor for 3 host 20 vm load with backup)
 I need to get this as cheap as possible (&lt;$5k) with reliability.
 The demand of the system is very very low. We have probably 80 windows clients that are AD joined, and use the DNS service. It also syncs to Azure and runs google script (I know it should be a PAW, but right now don&#x27;t have the vm to do this).
 Part of me thinks, okay bare metal, how few times anything has actually failed, it is likely to be fine.
 Throw together a box, install, and go.
 But the gnawing part of me says, do VM. But what part of VM makes sense unless a 2nd host can run it (Azure/AWS for backup?) and the storage is accessable.. (without spending on NAS/SAN, have a removeable raid 1 storage so it can go to another device)?
 Anyone have ideas on the minimal install for a server? Is proxmox or such worthwhile with small workstations that are under 2k each?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi /r/sysadmin, I&#x27;m an aspiring threat hunter who has been working as a cybersecurity engineer for about five years. While designing and implementing systems is fun, the detective work appeals to my inner curiosity.
 Much of my research around getting started in this field suggests learning an OS in-and-out, a close-second is learning a scripting language. Because I work in a Windows environment, it&#x27;s sensible to start with Windows and PowerShell. This makes sense, but I don&#x27;t know how to go about tackling the former. 
 There are some books, like Powershell for SysAdmins, that can teach me Windows administration through PowerShell--hitting two birds with one stone. Is this advisable or should I begin by learning Windows core processes and its other components independently of PowerShell so I don&#x27;t get overwhelmed?
 I fear I&#x27;m overthinking this, and I&#x27;d welcome that constructive criticism if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on. Helping me develop this area of my roadmap would be much appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m looking at options to simplify the management of multiple accounts across multiple tenants for our executive team. 
 Our execs will use accounts in the following separate tenants managed by separate IT teams:
 MrExec@company1.com MrExec@company2.com MrExec@company3.com
 They need to be able to send and receive mail on all 3 accounts but only really need to be fully Microsoft licensed on their primary. Currently they have licenses in all 3 and open 3 separate mailboxes in Outlook with various forwarding rules etc set up.
 Ideally it would be much simpler for them to manage with one account and mailbox and just use aliases from the other tenants but I haven’t been able to find any good docs on how to do that or if it’s even possible. Tenants have to stay as separate entities due to the way the companies are silo’d. 
 Looking for recommendations on how to do this simpler/better! Thank you

                              <span>I am having a problem at work. I am an asistant teacher at a school. So...the problem arises when I try to work in MSSQL Workbench it seems to be atempting to connect to a database on our domain? Therefore, I cannot autenthicate and do anything.
 I need all our lab laptops to work individually so that the students can work on their own databases.

                              <span>Disclosure: My company has no experience with Atrium or any security\access software for that matter. It’s just not our specialty, but we do have IT experience.
 Anyway...We’re doing some IT work for a friend and we need to replace an aging PC where Atrium is installed. I’m aware that in addition to the Atrium software itself there’s also a SQL database behind. Not sure if there are other dependencies or not. I have the Atrium software install for the new PC, but what steps are required to get everything transferred and running on the new PC while retaining all existing settings\access and of course not “breaking” anything.
 I was thinking the steps would be something like this. Or am I way off base here?
  
Backup existing SQL database
 Install Atrium software on new PC
 Restore database backup on new PC.
  
Thanks in advance if anyone has any experience doing this.

                              <span>I have about 30 odd new machines from Dell which have Windows 10 Pro installed. Instead of using our software imaging (Quest KACE) to save a bit of time I showed our desktop techs that they can simply put in the Windows 10 Enterprise key from our software licensing (we have an enterprise agreement) which saves the time on having to re image. They like the idea of saving time but also liked that the image answered the Windows installation questions from the Unattend.xml file I built within KACE scripted installations (we want to move away from KACE K2000 and don&#x27;t have SCCM).
 What I want to know is if it is possible to put an answer file of any sort into one of these new Dell machines to answer all the basics and setup a simple admin user so they can then get on the domain right away and start working.
 I have tried pulling the command prompt at OOBE load (Shift + F10) and have thrown an Unattend.xml file in both the C:\Windows\Panther and C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep folders but nothing happened as I had hoped.
 Any ideas? I hope this is clear enough, please ask any questions for clarification.

                              <span>Perfect way to ruin your weekend. I took this job 5 months ago as internal IT guy. Came into a place that has fat clients everywhere with no servers and everything MS365 cloud/onedrive. Passwords are flying around all over the place. And yes, they also used (and still use) Lastpass, which is, as we all know, compromised. When I came there, there were NO BACKUPS. Boss thought they were unnecessary because &quot;everything is taken care of by Microsoft&quot;. It took me 2 months to convince him that he was wrong about that. So I did implement a backup system which is running now. Also took care of other stuff and was testing out Intune for consistent MDM deployment.
 Boss was also global admin himself and fucks around with permissions and settings, causing problems that I don&#x27;t understand because he doesn&#x27;t tell me what he changed.
 He also has this minion dude that works a couple hours a week and barely knows how to install a computer.
 So yesterday I get called in and get this 3 page letter stating that I&#x27;m doing everything wrong, got my priorities wrong, I meddle in things that I should not meddle in, I&#x27;m watching Netflix at work on my laptop, which is a complete lie, and I&#x27;m not following orders. I&#x27;m not 21, I&#x27;m 52 with a ton of experience who&#x27;s jaw dropped when he said that he didn&#x27;t need any backups.
 So at the end of the talk, he says he withdraws my admin rights. So now I can&#x27;t do anything. &quot;Sure you can, just pick out the roles that you need&quot;. The little minion still retains rights.
 The little minion also says that I did not share the backup account password with him. I did. He looked in the wrong column of the spreadsheet.
 What the hell should I do?

                              <span>Hello there,
 i have an issue for the past few days and thought maybe someone with more experience can weigh in.
 our network team is creating a new wireless SSID for a new division and would like to isolate the from our main AAA server which is MS NPS with Active Directory.
 i have installed Oracle Linux 9.1 and then FreeRADIUS, added both the WLC and APs as clients, used a test user but no dice, when adding a windows machine as a client and test with NTRadPing i get accepted message, but when connecting to the AP nothing happens.
 on both FreeRADIUS and WLC the config is up to cisco documentation, but there is no communication between the two. i am sure i am missing something stupid but i cant put my finger on it.
 any help is appreciated because i am starting to feel really stupid for failing such a basic task.
 Regards,

                              <span>Hi guys! 
 So I&#x27;m still not very well documented regarding SCCM handling. I&#x27;m trying to create a simple recurring Maintenance Window for each software group, so it happens exactly the third weekend of the month, or one weekend after MS&#x27;s patching tuesday. This is to give some leeway week for the patches to be trialed on the test group in the first weekend. Is there a logical way to do so? Because the current setup is to manually input non-recurring MW for each damn month of the year... 
 Thanks!

Checked SPF, DKIM and DMARC and everything says passed. We put in a request with AT&amp;T but get nothing but the standard auto response and we are still blocked after several weeks. The bounces do not give any reason for the block so at this point, not sure where to go from here?

 On a related note: I had to work 16 hours today. I’m holed up in a hotel and have to work tomorrow for what I’m suspecting to be another 10ish hours. We’re migrating a bunch of new users. I’ve never felt less like this was for me than I do right now. How is this my job? Meanwhile I have friends who are fully remote and making bank working at their leisure.
 Guess this rant went a bit off the rails. I just don’t know want this to be my life going forward. This wasn’t what I signed up for when I took this job. Wish I could just catch my big break like my friends did.

As a network engineer I started out with some sniffing and general troubleshooting. The vendor keeps saying it&#x27;s our network without giving any reason why. We repeatedly ask for the group using the equipment (that is NOT supported by IT) to engage the vendor and look at the logs - or export the logs off the Windows 7 (yeah I know) embedded pc in the equipment and let US look at them. We have been explicitly (and rudely) told NOT TO TOUCH THE ANALYZERS.
 The vendor rep contacts me and we do a half-ass Teams meeting where the tech demonstrates an absolute lack of understanding of basic networking and the system in question. The group keeps emailing us daily to find a solution - we keep…</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am finishing up a migration from Intermedia (hosted Exchange) to Office 365. I have almost everything set up, but am facing a stumbling block. If you have any idea how to fix it or even another way of doing things, I&#x27;d appreciate your advice.
 To preface, our public folders contain mailbox enabled folders that have their own aliases that external users e-mail regularly. Our current setup allows only users assigned a public folders role to have access to see the public folders as its own entity under folders in their Outlook client. No one else sees it. For the migration, we are using BitTitan.
 In Office 365, I set up the public folder and using BitTitan, migrated the stuff over. I set explicit permissions using the public folder GUI in the Exchange admin center. However, everyone is seeing the public folders as if it&#x27;s a shared mailbox shared with everyone. I&#x27;ve found out how to limit unauthorized users from accessing the content, but the public folder mailbox remains. Any ideas of how to get rid of the mapping entirely for certain users?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent the last few weeks dealing with cloud services where something is broken and they just don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s ranged from a simple UI bug that provides incorrect instruction that would lead to an outage, to a poorly designed and documented system that will lead to a legitimate loss of data. I&#x27;ve heard responses from &quot;voice your concern in the community forum and let people vote on it&quot; to &quot;that&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s going to work, it&#x27;s up to you to deal with possible data loss&quot;
 I don&#x27;t regret cloud services...I don&#x27;t want to be thinking about CPU, storage, rackspace, maintenance windows, etc for every application I&#x27;m tasked with, but i do think that the exorbitant subscription licensing costs should provide some equal amount of product improvement and support. Maybe I&#x27;ve been huffing too much of the cloud not knowing it&#x27;s just smoke?

                              <span>hello
 not one to post but grasping at straws here so thought i would ask reach out and ask!
 i have an application installed in three different environments (current prod, test, to be new prod). Now the current prod is running an older version of the app, test and to be new prod are up to date. current prod is able to email out utilizing direct send (mx record), test is able to do the same thing. to be new prod is unable to send (too man recipients error) Volume is low so i know its not a limit issue. Low being 5-10 per day if that...each environment is in an isolated zone and confirmed no deny alerts when attempting to send, in fact we see the outbound connection as successful. now what am i missing? is this an 0365 issue (have opened a ticket just in case). The app vendor has been stumped by this as well..

                              <span>I’m a recent networking grad working for a big bank. I remember as a student delving into automation, everything was new and interesting. I had a lot of fun setting up small topologies in GNS3 and automating commands with Ansible and Nornir.
 Now that I’ve started my career, I’m very interested (from a selfish point of view but also as a way to increase my skills) in taking my automation skills to the next level.
 I’m under no illusions that throwing Python scripts to automate some config changes does not make me some automation wizard. Anyone with a keen interest in learning automation can get to that point in no time at all.
 With that being said, I’d really appreciate some seasoned automation people to share cool ideas they’ve implemented. 
 I was thinking of looking into how to create a web GUI that takes in a command and runs them against some specified devices. But then I think Ansible Tower is pretty similar to that, so I don’t think that would be the best return on time for me to create that (bearing in mind it’d take me a long time to learn how to create web GUIs).
 This post was borne out of a desire to understand how to get to the next level. As I’m working for a large enterprise with many networking colleagues, I want to be able to build automation tools that others can use, not just some one-off Python scripts.

                              <span>so I&#x27;m in the process of switching ISPs (home / residential service, no static IPs or BGP or anything like that).
 For a week or two I plan to run both concurrently, in a primary/failover scenario, while I make sure everything is solid.
 I&#x27;ve always had IPv6 via DHCP-PD; I know the new ISP provides IPv6 as well (it was able to pull a v6 address), including PD (based on reading).
 I set up the router to grab PD from both WANs, but so far it&#x27;s only pulling/using the primary ISP.
 I&#x27;ve been looking around, and I see that multi-wan PD is perhaps a common issue... then it occurred to me that perhaps it&#x27;s not even possible, given that such a configuration would essentially multi-home each host (right?).
 so my question is simple - is it even possible to use DHCPv6-PD from multiple ISPs without using BGP?
 Thanks in advance!

 We&#x27;re receiving MAC flapping notifications between two vWire interfaces on our C9300 (stacked). When a host MAC address starts to flap between interfaces, their connection stops working until the passive vWire connection is disabled. 
 Is this due to a misconfiguration? Does vWire need to be in port-channel/VPC between the active/passive firewall? Something like Po1 and Po2 on the C9300 and Po1 and Po2 on the Nexus for active/passive firewalls?
 MAC flapping between interface Te1/1/6 &amp; Te2/1/6 (vWire) on the C9300.
 When I run the command &#x27;show mac address table | include 1/12&#x27; on Nexus2 or &#x27;show mac address table | include 2/1/6&#x27; on the C9300, I see MAC addresses that shouldn&#x27;t be on there. These MAC addresses should be listed under the active firewall connections Te1/1/6 a…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys,
 We are trying to on board a new vendor who deployed their resources on AWS. Our team wants to connect to their platform using a single public IP. But they have many machines and some of them are created on demand. Is it possible to get into their network using a single private IP to access all machines?
 Not sure if I have provided all information required. Let me know if you need more.

                              <span>Hello,
 Kinda novice on this, I am building a windows 11 image for rollout. I understand that an &quot;image&quot; is not the most modern way to do it but I&#x27;m on a very limited time schedule. My question is about copyprofile in the autounattend.xml file. On Microsoft&#x27;s website it says that if you use copyprofile you need to delete certain registry entries after the fact using regedit. You need to load it up, open a hive etc. Is there an easy way to accomplish this over command line so it can be automated?
 Thanks

What happens is that your eyes may roll and get stuck when they get a glimpse of the captain of your brain for guidance, but he’s having the same problem, and his captain is having the same problem (etc) thus causing a multi dimensional recursive state. Eventually your neural stack overflows.
 But take comfort, your brain will reboot. You will try to reprocess events, but those poor neurons are fried. And don’t bother talking about the problem to anyone; it’s scrap code that will only give more form to a problem that should not exist.
 Don’t complain at all. It isn’t going to add any sense. Just put that little layer 8 object in a box, and push it into the sea of your mind, toward the waters where DNS probably lurks.
 Happy Friday!

                              <span>I will be moving into an IT Director role soon after spending my first 5 years as a Network Engineer and then my last 7 as a sysadmin. I have managed many projects but not people. I feel very confident and excited to jump into the IT Director role and my goal is to be the best manager/coworker I can be. I want my team members to be excited to come to work everyday. 
 For those that don&#x27;t manage people yet, like me. I Would love for you to chime in with what your current bosses do well and what you wish they did better.
 For current managers, what have you done to keep your team members engaged and excited to be a part of the team?
 I really want to focus on building a strong nitted team; that feels appreciated, encouraged, challenged, respected. Where we can celebrate our accomplishments, and learn from our mistakes and know that it is ok to fail.

                              <span>Hello,
 I took over the IT for a ~100 user company where I manage about everything.
 Last year, one project that was on hold was the replacement of the current switchboard for the reception / call center (three people) that is currently running with a very old solution, I&#x27;m not going into details but it doesn&#x27;t do much except receiving calls and displaying all users on a virtual switchboard.
 All other users are on Teams and it&#x27;s working good for them.
 The problems we currently have is that overall, the switchboard solution doesn&#x27;t know anything about users on Teams ; it doesn&#x27;t know if they are on call, away or simply offline.
 About 2 months ago I was approached by a vendor for an integrated solution that basically works &quot;below&quot; teams as a virtual PBX that can tehn route calls to Teams,…</span>

 We already know we want to assign F3 to folks like our Equipment Operators that work out of our Public Works department, they never are on a PC using Office and email very little.
 I&#x27;m just wondering other people&#x27;s use case(s) for Microsoft&#x27;s F3 license? What sector are you in and how to utilize the license (and for what type of user)?

Something people will look at and stop to ask about. 
 I already have Sonic Wall&#x27;s live attack map in my rotation. This is the best looking I&#x27;ve found so far, but I&#x27;m looking for a few more and perhaps something other than attacks. Got any good ones you like to check out? 
 Some other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found that are along the same lines as above.

                              <span>It seems like every Friday we have a user that goes to the pub after work and gets their laptop stolen. Today&#x27;s theft is surprisingly early, so it must have been a boozy lunch. Because of this, I am going to have someone on our junior staff create a training session on how to avoid getting your shit stolen while having a drinking session after work. Back in my party days I used to hook the strap of my backpack through a part of the chair and never got my bag stolen. What kind of tips or funny ideas do you have for a presentation to help people avoid getting their shit stolen while their necking a handful of lagers back at the pub? We have a young party culture with a lot of remote travel/work with clients that pay VERY well, so the old school grizzled administrator answers about making them pay for it or not bring their laptops home won&#x27;t be helpful.

I asked ChatGPT to write me a powershell script with a GUI to send an email. Simple enough, but it’s something that would take me a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour (if I write the entire GUI by hand and not use a template).. ChatGPT spat it out in seconds. On one hand, I can increase my productivity but on the other I hope my coworkers never find out about it lol.

                              <span>Corel acquired Roxio. We ran into a strange issue with a Roxio product and reached out to their support. Hands down, the most incompetent group of &quot;technicians&quot; I&#x27;ve encountered in ~20 years of working in IT.
 Our ticket was escalated to the higher tier of support and they initially attempted to help. But once none of their recommendations worked, they said &quot;Unfortunately your product version is no longer supported.&quot;
 I replied saying that can&#x27;t possibly be true, as you all are still actively selling the product. So they backtrack and ask, &quot;May I know proof of purchase?&quot; To which I responded that we no longer have the receipt. But sent them the activation key, the email used to originally purchase the software, and a screenshot logged into said account on our registered products page.
 From here, they send, &quot;Another user may be able to help you get an answer in one of the forums&quot; to which they provide a link that just goes to their parent company&#x27;s main page with no forums mentioned anywhere.
 So I inform them of this... and the response? &quot;May I know proof of purchase&quot; - same exact guy I have been speaking to this whole time. 
 I open a second ticket in an attempt to get a different technician. Specifically ask not to get &quot;Mr. XYZ&quot; and I end up back with him anyways. We have the exact same conversation mentioned above and this is a never ending loop. We got so frustrated we decided to say fuck that software and bought a similar one from a different vendor.
 TL:DR - Corel bought Roxio. Their support sucks dick for gas money, and then rides their bike.

                              <span>Why are development practices pushed on the rest of the IT staff? Weekly sprints. All the Scrums. Using development lingo that really doesn&#x27;t apply to Infrastructure or networking. Multiple boards and no obvious single point of information. 
 How to make this stop? Or does it just fail under its own weight?

                              <span>Anyone have a suggestion on equipment to indicate the status of a room? I’m not looking for a panel based solution (don’t want walk ups) just a light that can exist outside a room so users can see, from a distance, if a room is in use. Usage determined by booking status in Outlook preferably. Long term ask here is to to control multiple status lights for some larger spaces (a relay would work). PoE would be great.
 I know Crestron had a solution for this but looking for something less expensive and closed.

                              <span>My company has me looking into and meeting with Front App. We are a logistics company and the volume of email we get is tremendous, we receive around 100k emails a day for a 150 person company. A lot of it is emails going to multiple people because of how teams and distribution groups are setup.
 I have sent out training to users on how to create rules and manage the volume of mail with retention policies and even showing them how they can bulk delete them selves online, but it seems to be getting too much and users aren&#x27;t following direction. We have tried shared mailboxes for some teams, but due to the volume of mail and people accessing it, it tends to crash outlook and does more harm then good. 
 I have a meeting with Front&#x27;s technical team, just want to know if anyone has tried to make the transition to a software like this and is there anything I am looking over? And or how have you overcome the problem of high volumes of email?
 Concerns I have:
  
We have around 1000 distribution groups which we would have to use Microsoft&#x27;s SMTP settings for each distribution group and would be a manual setup for each. The other option is using Front and their servers and updating our SPF/DKIM records, though then Microsoft will then not have a record of those outbound emails.
 Adds another point of failure for email, as now if Front goes down everything will be forwarded to their system.
 Learning curve for end users, we would have to switch around 80% of our company to this.

I&#x27;m pretty average when it comes to this stuff, however since the cameras don&#x27;t support tagging like a phone does, I need to dedicate ports on the switch to vlan 40 for the cameras. easy enough. what do i do with the nvr? i can&#x27;t put that onto v40 by itself as users need to view cameras, i need to rdp into them, windows updates are needed, etc, etc. would it need to 2 nic or would it just run on a port that has access to all vlan&#x27;s, i believe thats called a trunk port. ty all

 I have a Samsung 980 in an external enclosure connected via USB. The drive is formatted and mounts in windows. The Samsung Magician software says the firmware is 0212, which sounds wrong based on various articles. Should say 3B2QGXA7.

                              <span>Hello Sysadmins, long time lurker, finally posting with an issue I&#x27;m facing. 
 I have 4 users on Mac&#x27;s that I need to export their mail from and then import that mail into their new email address which is a completely different domain name. If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, Mac can&#x27;t export to PST and it&#x27;s an OLM file (I think?) 
 User 1 &#x3D; 48GB
 User 2 &#x3D; 47GB
 User 3 &#x3D; 20GB
 User 4 &#x3D; 70GB (I thought 50gb was the max but here we are)
 Normally on a PC I would just export to PST and then import into their new account in Outlook. I feel like is outdated and there might be a different or better way to do this? I know PST&#x27;s can get corrupted during the export/import process so this whole process feels fragile. 
 Any ideas, suggestions, tips or wild ass guesses are welcome. I&#x27;ve considered joining the French Foreign Legion to avoid this so that is always an option. 
 Thank you!

 Do you have any suggestion? Or maybe just put a pic of how you are organized? and even the rest of your spare stock how to you sote them?

                              <span>Clearly my Google-fu is lacking on this one because I just get results about genuinely duplicate (i.e. identical) records.
 Every so often I&#x27;ll notice two user accounts in our domain with VERY similar names, usually one character is different (e.g. Jon Smith/John Smith/John Smyth). You can tell they&#x27;re the same person because their Office, Job Title, Department, even their unique employee number is the same.
 How on earth do I go about finding them without just poring through a list of 3500+ users? Is there an Excel function I can use?

                              <span>My team and I re-evaluated our printing needs in the office recently due to drastically decreased attendance and decided to simplify, we&#x27;ve purchased two HP Color LaserJet Enterprise MFP M681dh multifunction printers which will ultimately serve as the only printers in the office. Our compliance team mentioned that a requirement they&#x27;ve been issued by one of our auditors is to provide print verification, so sensitive print jobs don&#x27;t just get left at the printer for anyone to pick up (finance reports, etc). We&#x27;ve considered both PIN verification at the printer&#x27;s display panel, or badge scanning.
 Those of you who have set this up, what method are you using and what were the hardware requirements. Are you using a print server, and if so, what software are you running and is it on-prem or cloud based? If you&#x27;re using badge scanning, what model of scanner are you using? Any information you could provide on your setup would be helpful, I&#x27;m just trying to get a lay of the land before I make any big decisions on server hardware or software contracts.

With no gateway (so it does not conflict with our other services on the old network) and DNS set to 10.10.20.250 and 10.10.10.250. I am trying to connect to the Server via RDP while on the new network (10.0.0.0/24) and it will work for a day or so and then won&#x27;t allow me to connect anymore what is going on?

What platforms (web/mobile) do you use to help all people communicate, have profiles, share company events, RSVP, see policies and documentation, etc. I know some companies built internal apps, some use all Microsoft applications, some use 3rd party platforms like Monday.com, Jostle, MangoApps, Workvivo, Etc. Wondering what people have experience with and any feedback! Looking to implement something for our company but would like to hear some real work experience before pulling a trigger.

 we have a (small) customer who has an AD domain called contoso.com, which is the same as their web site www.contoso.com etc. As a result, we have to maintain DNS records like &#x27;www&#x27; in both the AD DNS as well as in the public DNS zone. Is there a way around this?
 I know that there is a thing called DNS policies, but I&#x27;m not sure if this would actually help in this case.

 https://github.com/microsoft/New-KrbtgtKeys.ps1 
 But this gives me the error message that there are problems with the RPC connection.
 Gathering and analyzing writable domain controller information...
 Checking RPC connectivity to domain controllers:
 Checking RPC connectivity to DC03.contoso.local .....FAILED
 Checking RPC connectivity to DC02.contoso.local .....FAILED

 ​
 But when I check the replication per: repadmin /replsummary I get the message everything is ok.
 How would you proceed?

                              <span>Damn I hate being that guy who writes the whole question in the thread subject but it kind of sums it up.
 New R750 and did a normal LifeCycle Controller install of Server 2022 on the bare metal RAID1 BOSS and it&#x27;s showing a D drive named &quot;OS&quot; that is 2GB FAT in Disk Manager and an E drive labelled &quot;OEMDRV&quot;.
 Looks like OEMDRV will disappear by itself but does anyone know what the OS partition and drive letter is all about please?

 What technologies would you use, if you had complete control over the decision making?
 Endpoint users hardware, software suites. Servers, networking, firewalls, telephony, printing, access management. IT software and services like: remote access software, ITAM, ITSM etc. If I missed something or the instructions are not clear, feel free to fill in the blanks youselves!
 This could be an interesting way to learn about new technologies, or how well some technologies work together, and to overall see where people stand!

                              <span>Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I would like to take a moment to address all the hardworking Admins and System Engineers who may have faced moments of intense stress while working on critical infrastructure. I want to extend my apologies for potentially wasting your time, but I felt it was important to reach out and share my recent experience.
 Recently, I was working on our ESXi cluster and FC Fabric to add another storage system.
 I had to reload the FC zone, and despite knowing that the other switch should carry the load, the system briefly halted, causing me great concern. My heart raced as I feared the worst, but fortunately, the failover worked as expected.
 I understand that moments like these can be incredibly stressful and can take a toll on one&#x27;s mental and emotional well-being. I empathize with anyone who has experienced similar situations and want you to know that you are not alone. Let&#x27;s continue to support each other and work together to ensure that our critical systems remain stable and secure.
 Thank you for all the hard work that you do, and I wish you all the best.

 Any 3rd party tool I can use - that detects their name/picture and &#x27;blur&#x27; it kinda, if that even exists? I&#x27;m just sick of reading about/seeing influencers and them showing up so many places daily hah

 We&#x27;re noticing an issue where we can&#x27;t seem to login through www.onedrive.com nor outlook links. But CAN login (for example) using www.office.com and navigate to sharepoint (from there) by hand.
 Getting &quot;401 UNAUTHORIZED&quot;
 Reverting to previous ESR resolves it.

                              <span>We&#x27;re only 14 employees deep right now, soon to be 18 but eventually will be 40-50 max.
 We looked at Scalefusion which works I guess but I didn&#x27;t get the greatest vibe from the sales team.
 We have company owned Windows machines and BYOD Android and iPhone. We may eventually offer company phones.
 Maybe MDM is overkill right now? I&#x27;d personally like it for work profiles on my phone and added security for company data but with 14 of us I&#x27;m unsure.

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Backstory:
 I used to work in a ~120 heads high tech/cloud computing/manufacturing/ex Start Up (still behaving like one) company in an 1,5 head internal IT department (Doing everything but working on our actual products). Me being the 1 fully busy head.
 Got a support call from a senior cloud engineer [second year in cloud, plus maybe 5 in analytics experience ontop] (Working on the actual product). User needed help setting up new desk, new dock, monitors and all that.
 &quot;Hey, could you please help me? My screens are all kinda messed up. The right one shows the same as the left one...&quot; I right click, open screen settings, change to extended and arrange the screens. &quot;Wow, that was easy. Thanks for showing me yada yada ..&quot;
 How dafuq can such a person manage to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree in IT?! 
 Imagine them standing in front of the committee of IT Professors, trying to defend their thesis and going: &quot;Hmm, the beamer throws my Power Point notes on the wall, it&#x27;s not supposed to do that. Could you please call IT support?&quot;
 And the Prof.: &quot;Sure no problemo, let&#x27;s call them and wait a fucking eternity until they come in and fix this damn beamer. Back in the old days we used overhead Projectors were it was impossible to paste the notes on the wall, because who would be so stupid to print them on the same piece of foil as the presentation. The good old times, am I right?&quot;
 I myself am only working ~6 years in IT (3 years apprenticeship[Ausbildung in Germany], 3 years hands on). But I notice with a lot of new graduate IT colleagues comming from university, their basic skills are just non existent.
 A friend of mine seriously tried to buy network HUBs in his company, because he learned in university that those can transmit data way faster because of the lack of overhead. He got really upset that you can no longer buy those. o_O

 I&#x27;m pretty new to Sharepoint (overall not super used to m365) so I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss here. Does anyone have any experience with this and could point me in the right direction?

They need .NET 4.8 for some applications they run. However, when I go to install it I get an error stating that .NET 4.8 isn&#x27;t compatible with the OS. It however installs fine on the other fresh 2019 standard server we&#x27;ve setup for them. Both Hyper-V VMs with all updates installed. We&#x27;ve tried setting the CSDVersion reg key to 100, removing .NET 4.7 and re-installing, all Windows updates are installed and both sfc scan and DISM health check come back fine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>First of all, let me apologize if this is supposed to be something basic to ask but I can&#x27;t figure out where I can find the right settings. 
 We have started deployment of HP thin clients in our environment and now getting started testing out HP Device Manager. Initially, I installed HP Device Manager on my PC and discovered the thin clients on the network. Now I have installed the HP Device Manager on the server and was also able to discover the same thin client devices from the new server and able to push settings to the thin clients without issue.
 ​
 I am wondering if there is a settings somewhere that once an HP thin client has been discovered and configured, it will only access connections from a sort of &quot;approved HP Device Manager server&quot; and allow it settings to be change when some sort of authentication is done.
 ​
 In terms of security, there is firewall between server subnet and think client subnet that can block unwanted traffic but the issue lies that, in the current state, device on the same broadcast network as the thin client are able to discover the think client.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions and solutions.

                              <span>Hey r/,
 I have 2 job opportunity´s who have offered basically the same salary package. Both work places are 30 minutes away and one has 30 somewhat employees and the other 10.
 One workplace wants me to manage their private cloud which hosts applications and is used across the world. However they only use open source (proxmox, proxmox backup, local emailservers (cant remember the name), nothing in Azure, no m365, only old generation hardware) and windows services (ad, iis, rdp sessions, ...) for clustering and redundancy.
 The other workplace also wants me to manage their datacenter, but mostly go on projects to customers to replace firewalls, servers, storage, migrate AD etc... and uses industry standards (azure, m365, hpe, vmware, hyperv,...) however they are a small company and are less visible in the community. They also have an older standards of the workplace (fixed hours, no remote work) 
 Ive recently been studying and certificating in azure and vmware, and it seems a waste should i choose company 1. Im sure i can get the datacenter migraties to azure and vmware in the future but then ill be working with non industry standards (in my region at least) for at least a couple years. It will be challenging and ill definetly have freedom, but will not gain experience in hardware or cloud technology.
 Company 2 seems a better fit regarding my study and experience, but I fear being invisible in the community.
 Based on this, what option would you go for? I currently work somewhere with a 1 to 2 hour drive so they are tempting offers.

                              <span>Hi Guys
 I have a Lenovo Think System T250 standalone server with Windows Server 2019 that has suddenly become slow. I highly suspect that it is the operating system volume drives (RAID 1, 2 drives) that are causing the issue as performance monitor is detecting high I/O and all else appears fine. There are C and D volumes, each with 2 drives in RAID 1. I plan on replacing the drives volume C with ones with same capacity and higher read/write speeds.
 ​
 What would be the best way to go about changing these drives?
  
Shutting down server, replacing 1 of the drives and starting backup, let it rebuild then do same with second drive.
  
2.Taking image backup of Volume C, shutting down, taking both drives out and replacing with new ones and recover from the image backup with bootable flash drive. Would this cause issue with volume D?
 Or any other suggestions would be appreciated.

 We run a remoteapp in Azure Virtual Desktop on session hosts running Windows 10 multi-session. Starting a few weeks ago, we began having an issue where RAM usage overnight would not fully bottom out after most of the users had signed out, and it would get worse daily until the server&#x27;s rebooted again.
 After a reboot on Sunday, by Thursday night a server with 3 users online reported as having 30+ GB of RAM in use, with barely anything running. Everything in Processes in task manager totaled up to less than 5 GB.
 After googling it and eventually checking out RAMMap from sysinternals, I was able to det…</span>

                              <span>Hi all. First thing, I appreciate all of you. The stories, advice and humor for many years. Never posted here but I’m struggling and need advice. 
 Currently 15 years as a sysadmin. Actually more like “Generalist”. Two man shop, no funding, no appreciation, and a server closet with a half ass wall mounted hvac they refuse to replace. Big manufacturer facility. So you know the story. Anyway, I make it work. 
 I’ve run it all and all on prem. AD, SQL, exchange, phones. All the janky manufacturing software and CAD. Currently building CMMC and splitting the network in two for this. Man it’s a lot. 
 I also do all their custom software. C#, custom services, databases, asp.net. Did Swift for fun for a couple years, got good enough to answer questions on stack exchange. Learning Rust now for fun.…</span>

My company has no legal team, no security team and HR (thankfully) has nothing to do with IT. Is having these departments/teams more of a large company thing?

                              <span>I have two CBS350 switches stacked and I&#x27;m managing it via the OOB port on stack member 1. For redundancy should the second member&#x27;s OOB also be connected? 
 I&#x27;ve tried to find documentation on this, but it&#x27;s not in the manual. My concerns are:
 -Will this create a loop? Does STP even work on the OOB int?
 -Does doing this provide the expected solution, where if member 1 fails, the stack can still be managed via the OOB interface on the second member.
 -Would the management IP somehow move to the other OOB int?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Was wondering if I could get another perspective on this issue that suddenly occurred. It&#x27;s got me scratching my head as well as a colleague of mine. So, here&#x27;s the scenario...
 I&#x27;ve got about 20 Adtran Netvantas situated through my network. My admin AD account creds work just fine in all of them. In each switch, there&#x27;s a local &quot;sadmin&quot; user created that has worked fine up until last night. 
 I was in a new switch last night using &quot;sadmin&quot; getting ready to config RADIUS on it and suddenly my sadmin account failed on me when I had to SSH back in. Strangely enough, I then discovered that the &quot;sadmin&quot; creds failed on all my switches. This account is not an AD account, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s got us puzzled... 
 service password-encryption
 !
 username &quot;sadmin&quot; password encrypted &quot;2e225c6676944cbfe03d03126a45db4dbeae&quot; 
 Any insight and/or suggestions as to why this suddenly happened across all my switches would be appreciated. TIA folks.

 Can somebody please elaborate the difference between Virtual LAN Service and Virtual Private LAN Service ? 
 I have seen some blogs that highlighted that the difference is that VLS is a P2P sevice while VPLS is Multipoint-To-Multipoint, but I dont see how can that be the difference since with Flat VLS we can achieve the same thing?
 Thanks all

                              <span>I recently started a management gig at a K12 school and one of the items on my agenda is to modernise the switching within the school.
 Currently we are mostly Aruba switching with a mix of Cisco switches in nodes around the school. Our core switch is Cisco however most of our major nodes are Aruba.
 So here is the issue; our state govsrment is overhauling our wireless and providing a replacement for every wireless access point and these will ALL be cisco as well as a Cisco WLC. 
 I would like to start using smart monitoring software like Juniper Mist, Cisco DNS or HP Airwave but I am under the assumption that we everything will need to be the same vendor for this to be clean and effective.
 The other issue is that the team im not leading has very limited switching experience and in order to Change that I&#x27;d like to get them used to a specific vendors way of doing something first.
 Has anyone got any advice on which vendor to go with for switching? Do I have a problem if I mix switches and want to use the software? Or am I making this a bigger issue than it needs to be.
 So to sum up I am considering: CISCO HP Aruba JUNIPER UBIQUITI 
 NOTE: Assume budget is no issue and we are just aiming for the best possible setup.

 I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right sub to post this. If not, please let me know and I&#x27;ll delete my post.
 I currently work as a help desk tech at an MSP and while I like and am good with computers, my strong suit has always been software. Probably my weakest area of understanding is networking. I get the extremely high-level concepts, enough to troubleshoot networking issues on a single computer. But the thought of working on a firewall puts up a mental block of &quot;I can&#x27;t do this, this is beyond me&quot;.
 I want to change that and I started with doing the Sophos Network Engineer certification since my MSP uses Sophos products. However, some of the basic concepts I&#x27;m struggling with. I then found an Intro to Networking course on Coursera that is really helping me. To make sure I&#x27;m concep…</span>

The owner doesn&#x27;t care about the community version anymore (which is understandable, it doesn&#x27;t pay his bills, I guess). Is there a better alternative (open source)? I&#x27;ve read LibreNMS, and Prometheus are alternatives. What can you guys recommend (long-term)? We also run smokeping. I appreciate any help you can provide.

                              <span>Hi everyone, was wondering if I can get yalls recommendations on routers for my restaurant. Currently using the netgear AX12 RAX120 model. So far I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my ISP or the router but it constantly seems like there&#x27;s too much going on and instantly sort of reboots itself. I have x2 POS systems and 1 sort of POS its a self order kiosk. These are all hard wired and I have an extender converted into an AP hard wired as well. A pc that&#x27;s connected wireless ly, I want to connect my TV In the dinner area but when I do it slows our POS card payments. Any help/ would be greatly appreciated. 🙏

                              <span>At our datacenter we have 3 providers. Lumen, Spectrum, and AltaFiber. We peer with Lumens AS3356 and we peer with AltaFibers primary AS as well. 
 The problem is that we peer with one of Spectrums regional ASs, 10796, vs their &#x27;backbone&#x27; Charter AS7483. In this case, many would be preferred routes are now an additional AS away. 
 Is it possible to strip AS10796 out of the routes which also have AS7483 so that I can install them with one less AS in the path? Has anyone done this or does anyone have any experience with a similar scenario?
 Thanks!

 We have a full SDA Fabric (45 sites). We&#x27;re currently running C9300-24p for the Border/Control (Its really a FiB). Anyways we will be switching to C9300-48-UHX for wifi 6 reasons (along with mgig capabilities). 
 My main concern is, are we going to have to completely tear down the Fabric site and essentially rebuild each site from scratch? 
 I know in the past we have replaced switches with the same model and that worked fine but I don&#x27;t see using the &quot;mark for replacement&quot; feature working in this case. 
 Just seeing if anyone has gone through this yet at all. Posted in the cisco community forum a couple weeks ago but no responses yet there either.

                              <span>Hi Folks, been lurking on this sub for a while but this is my first post.
 Been in a Network Engineer/Network Admin role for 3+ years. Mostly for smaller scale government networks. I&#x27;ve made it to the final round of interviews for a position as an MPLS engineer.
 I feel confident about some of the things they want, like L2 switching, L3 routing, OSPF/BGP and Cisco familiarity. The problem is that I haven&#x27;t touched MPLS professionally in a while, and when I did it was on the customer end. The company I&#x27;m interviewing with is a provider. Aside from a core understanding of MPLS, I&#x27;ve also been told they&#x27;re going to want to talk about: Segment Routing, Pseudowire, VRF, VPRN, VPLS, EVPN, 1588, and TWAMP. They&#x27;ve also mentioned the ISIS routing protocol which I&#x27;m not too familiar with.
 I understand the theory of MPLS and I&#x27;ve been individually researching these other topics. I was wondering if you guys know any solid video series, courses/labs, or books that would cover most or all of these things under the MPLS umbrella. The interview is next week so my aim is not to sound like a complete clown when I talk about MPLS. Any advice appreciated!

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Network for reference: (Edit: I tried to do spacing here but it didnt work. SW1 has SW 2 and 3 below. SW 2 has 4 and 5 below and SW3 has 6 and 7 below)
 SW1
 SW2 SW3
 SW4 SW5 SW6 SW7
 I am currently trying to gain insight in a network and to do that we are installing a sensor on SW1. We then used RSPAN get all traffic from all of the lower switches up to SW1 for the local SPAN. Currently SW6 and SW7 have remote VLAN 111 going to SW3. But once we try forwarding SW3 to SW1 using VLAN 111 it creates a loop and sends a copy back to SW6 and SW7 since the trunk allows the VLAN both ways.
 Any solutions to this issue?
 We are thinking of having RSPAN on SW4, 5, 6 and 7 use VLAN 111 and then configure RSPAN on SW2 and 3 to use VLAN 112 so that way the traffic is only able to go one direction. Not sure if this would work.
 Thanks all!

 I&#x27;m wondering, is there a way to tell if only have four is choking our bandwidth and I should add a 5th?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have a quick question for those of you using Anyconnect VPN on ASA/FTD.
 When you upload Anyconnect images to the VPN appliance, do upload only the latest version that your company uses or all possible images that are present in your enviroment?
 Is there a reason to upload older versions on the firewall at all?
 Only thing I can think of is the recent bug in Anyconnect that triggers auto update even if it&#x27;s disabled in the XML.
 Another reason could be related to XML scheme that might change some parameters between releases of the supplicant.

Is it somehow possible without the failure of the first switch? It is enough to add &quot;switch 2 provision ws-c2960s-48fps-l&quot; to the first switch and then connect the stack cable and the second switch will automatically download the config when it is turned on for the first time?

                              <span>My company is shifting to a new location and is using this as an opportunity to implement a &quot;hybrid work&quot; policy where the office is more like a co-working space except it&#x27;s privately owned.
 Employees are encouraged to work from home and need to appear only twice a week. Max capacity of 60 devices running fully on cloud apps at the premisesas well. No local file servers, no VoIP, no email servers, none of that legacy tech. So floating population of employees using unassigned desks with only docking stations and monitors that connect to company issued chromebooks for better productivity. 
 All client devices i.e chromebooks, tablets, mobile phones, new printers will run over wifi.
 Though we feel WiFi should work here if implemented properly. What are the biggest issues to be weiry of? What would the challenges be when scaling up the number of clients in the future?

                              <span>How do you deal with CDNs in your environment? We have several sites using SDWAN over 10mbps circuits. We get a ton of complaints about teams/webex calls being interrupted and after looking at the usage there can be 2--6mbps being eaten up by CDNs. Is there anything we can do to help. There are business policies that can be created on the CE, but not easy to find ranges that these CDNs use. Here is a few that I have seen
 cloudfront.net - aws
 map2.ssl.hwcdn.net - looks like Edge from MS
 deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com - after digging, looks like possibly Teams

                              <span>We purchased ~40 of these Planet industrial 24 port switches for a very specific project (non customer carrying networks).
 When configuring Radius/User/Privileges, there is no option to set the privilege level of Radius users. When Radius users login, they have no privileges which makes the user basically useless.
 I&#x27;ve reached out to our account team and the manufacturer and they report that the underlying SDK doesn&#x27;t allow for them to set the privilege level of Radius users and we would need to use TACACS.
 Surely this can&#x27;t be the case. Radius authentication without the ability to use the Radius user? No VSA, template user, default privilege adjustment? I have to create a user locally before it can be useful?
 Somebody tell me this isn&#x27;t true.

                              <span>We have over 500 Yealink T42S devices connected via POE on the network. For the past several months, these devices are randomly freezing (as in the screen is not responding / no dial tone) and a reboot is required to bring them back.
 Our network stacks are Juniper EX4300 with ClearPass implementation.
 ​
 The freezing is randomly, and it occurs randomly too.
 No firewall issues and nothing on the network was changed in these past months.
 All devices have the same firmware.
 As well we put couple of them on DC power and they still freeze.
 ​
 Anyone experienced that before?

                              <span>We have a client that uses Meraki AP in their facility but managed by another provider. They have a guest SSID that guests connect and they are prompted via browser to enter the username and password then they are authenticated connect to the wireless. My question is how would you bypass the authentication login screen for media devices that you can only enter the password. For example they have purchased media devices for online TV but with these devices you can only enter the WiFi password which obviously will not work.
 I&#x27;ve reached out the provider about the issue and they told me just open up the web browser on these media devices to authenticate which I keep telling them it doesn&#x27;t work that way. Has anyone dealt with similar issue or this type of issues at all.
 Hopefully what I&#x27;ve stated makes sense if not I can re-try explaining to the best of my ability again.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am currently work in a Network Engineer role for a small MSP. I&#x27;m looking to take my networking skills and move towards network automation / DevOps role. Any tips or things to study to start to navigate towards that direction? I have device experience with bigger vendors already (Cisco, Juniper, Fortigate, Meraki &amp; etc) so I&#x27;m ready a little familiar with Python via Cisco. Also, if there are any certs or things to better my resume, I&#x27;m always down to get more certs!
 A little history: Been in the network field 5+ yrs. I currently have CCTRS, CCNA &amp; JNCIA. I learned deeper protocols and Troubleshooting working for an ISP then moving to this MSP got more advanced with firewalls and internal routing protocols. I was considering getting the Cisco DevNet then continuing to CCNP vía that route but I heard it doesn&#x27;t hold much weight in careers right now. 
 Any advice is beneficial! Thank you all!

 1. Can I use the RMI+RP under the redundancy settings for these devices even though they are on different subnets? If not, any other ideas for HA?
 2. On the initial deployment of the .ova, there was a step where we could have put in the S/N and PnP information. Is that necessary for full functionality? If so, where do I find the S/N?

 I&#x27;m going to be sitting in for an interview (virtual) in a few hours and I&#x27;m pretty nervous.
 It&#x27;s for a Network Computer Support Technician position.
 Here are some of the PD:
 The Tier 1 maintenance of the on-site ADCS systems and subsystems, performing preventive and corrective maintenance and monitoring the on-site and remote locations. 
 Operations and maintenance of communications/computer systems and networks.
 Installs communications/computer systems in accordance with the respective installation spec.
 Troubleshooting and support of communications systems/networks.
 Working knowledge of Cisco system support/maintenance, VMware ESXi system support/maintenance, Active Directory, Windows Server 2019, HBSS, ACAS, SQL, SolarWinds, and Splunk preferred.
 Terminate ADCS circuits activated at the node point-of-presence (POP).
 I have my Net+ and Sec+ but not much experience other than doing some A+ stuff at a small PC shop in highshcool
 Any tips for the interview would be greatly appreciated!

There is considerable traffic coming from 192.168.20.200 (remote site) going to 192.168.30.10 (local site) never being logged. I am seeing local traffic of 192.168.30.10 and 192.168.31.22 . What am I missing?

                              <span>I have problem with EAP-TLS on Cisco ISE. Access to our WiFi is based on machine certificates. Computers with Windows OS use Anyconnect supplicant and it works good. But problem is with MacOSX. Anyconnect supplicant is not supporting this system so we need to use built-in supplicant. We try as below:
  
Machine certificate on MacOSX, but by default, iOS and macOS supplicants use the certificate identity common name for the EAP Response Identity it sends to the RADIUS server during 802.1X negotiation. So we get host name as a username - ISE can&#x27;t find this username and rejecting connection.
 User certificate on MacOSX, but we get error: &quot;EAP-TLS failed SSL/TLS handshake because of an unsupported certificate in the client certificate chain&quot;. Enhanced-Key-Usage is &quot;client authentication&quot; because I found that &quot;all purpose&quot; can be blocked.
  
Do you have any idea?

 Currently we have an Untangle box doing some web inspection and a Sonicwall box doing SSL VPN.
 Is there a Fortigate or similar box that would do both tasks? ~150 users.

I&#x27;ve just had a child who is now 4 months and also started up a hobby which takes place two times a week. I&#x27;m struggling to find time to dedicate to study to progress my career while still spending quality time with the family. Any advice would be greatly appreciated Cheers!

                              <span>Hello, I am currently developing a multiplayer video game that will be using UDP P2P and I wish to use hole/nat punching to solve the issue with users not having to configure their router ports and/or network settings.
 I&#x27;ve managed to set up a system with a middle hand server that introduces users to each other (I believe it is called a STUN server?). Each user connects to this and a user (client) can request to be matched with another user (host). If a suitable host is found, the host is notified of the client and vice versa, they then start punching each other. This setup seems to work as intended, for most cases at least...
 The problem I am facing is in the case that the hosting user is on a non-public ip adress. The &quot;handshake&quot; via hole punching does not seem to get confirmed and the connection fails.
 Is there some kind of way to solve this issue? A relay server is not really part of the plan as it includes additional latency and costs.
 ​
 Edit: or could this issue not be related to the IP being private and instead be a router issue?

                              <span>Lately I&#x27;ve been expanding larger which results in me leasing equipment for different applications and sometimes I have different base OSs with different networking configurations for when I need to tunnel back into my network to give the machine an IP on my load balancer such that its protected and can access my SAN in my backbone cabinet. 
 I end up in systemd networking, netplan, etc/network/interfaces, configuring interfaces manually. Would there be a way I could have a docker container to consolidate this and point applications to a local subnet 127.0.100.1 or 127.0.200.1 and it would have within the container NAT database for mangling those to send over tunnel before the open internet.
 Would I be able to accomplish something similar to this in docker when I would give each application machines a /29 or /28 for multiple addresses it needs to reference and translate?

                              <span>I have an ISR 1111-8p deployed at a location by an ISP
 the ISR1111 is the default gateway for the production network as x.x.x.1/29 on G0/0/1
 The WAN is connected via G0/0/0
 there is a firewall between the production network at x.x.x.2/29
 The ISR1111 happens to also have 8 switch ports off to the side at G0/1/x
 I have a test firewall plugged into the ISR at G0/1/0 with x.x.x.3/29 &amp; GW: x.x.x.1
 I&#x27;ve seen mention of creating a vlan &amp; SVI and ip add x.x.x.4/29, then assigning G0/1/0 to access that vlan
 But would that get traffic routing from a public IP? or would this method only work if the VLAN was a private address and NAT was enabled?
 Are we just missing an ip route from x.x.x.4 to x.x.x.2?
 Unfortunately my layer 3/routing knowledge is lackluster and I feel I&#x27;m beating my head against a wall on this one.
 There&#x27;s a support ticket in with the ISP to config their equipment, but I&#x27;m trying to understand what would be needed in this scenario and, I don&#x27;t have access to an ISR image to lab it.
 EDIT: I should add, I haven&#x27;t found a router image in my lab that has a layer 2 only add-in card

The problem is sometimes people on the east coast of the US will get routed to the EU then back to the US which makes the solution much worse overall. How can I use BGP communities or weighting to solve this issue or do I just need to create more &quot;satalite&quot; PoPs in order to decrease the effect that tromboning will have?

 They have two subnets in an on-prem data center connected to Azure with an Azure Express Route on a Verizon MPLS tunnel. The data center traffic flows through a firewall blocking all external traffic in and out.
 Hosts in Subnet A can get a response from our appliance in Azure, and a successful TCP handshake occurs with the properly signed Digicert certificate returned from the Nginx web server. The traceroute looks the same whether we use the sub.domain.net FQDN or the private 10.16.12.x IP:

                              <span>Hello, 
 Currently working on a project. We are configuring two Core Switches to be in HSRP configuration.
 We have a single ASA right before it hits our router. Currently this ASA has routes configured to forward traffic to our Core Switch 1. Does this ASA need configurations that will point traffic to Core Switch 2? Or, because the two Core Switches share a virtual IP for a gateway, ASA doesn&#x27;t need any additional configuration?

                              <span>Hello networking friends. Looking for opinions on design. Quick overview of what the campus looks like now then i’ll lead to my question.
 Currently the campus has a pair of HA Palo Alto’s. They lead down to two cores which are Nexus 7706s. The two cores feed roughly 40 building totaling to 118 closets.
 The cores are in VDCs. One VDC on each core is for the buildings described above (call it the staff vdc). This VDC has L3 connectivity to the other VDC for the data center. 
 A majority of L3 default gateways live at the distribution layer for the staff vdc and most L3 gateways for DC vlans live in the data center core.
 The team is being tasked with segmenting traffic.
 Would you all migrate L3 gateways to the PANs to zone them or would you VRF and leave the L3s where they are? The vrfs could match zone names going forward What’s the industry standard for this ? Is there another option i’m totally missing?
 Thoughts and opinions appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting ready to place the bid on my second networking job that I will be doing in an RV park.
 The park has about 70 available slots for RVs/campers. Each location has an outdoor weather protected power outlet that I could use for a POE. 
 Several of the RV locations also have existing coax and conduit all ran to one central location that I can utilize as a hub for a switch and place access points in several locations.
 However I also noticed that some of the coax was ran to the point of service for our ISP near a pole and would not be able to be utilized as I believe the drop belongs to them ( we work for the most of thel isps).
 I&#x27;m looking for a recommendation on some ubiquity equipment that could be both hardwired and wirelessly bridged for setting up one large or several small mesh networks.
 I&#x27;ll also take any advice anyone else has here on formats of asking questions for my post or any job tips.
 I&#x27;m sure I could wear my way through it on my own but I would love to hear from somebody who&#x27;s done more than one.
 Most of the networking experience I do have has been just simply running CAT5 and commercial buildings and setting up a simple switch, point to point radios and serval years trouble shooting internet, phone lines and simple wifi.

 i get:

 i get 
 the requested self port (/Common/16.200.10..100 6 22) was not found. 
 i&#x27;ve tried different variations returning the same error message. 
  modify /net self 16.200.10..100 { address 16.200.10..100/26 allow-service delete { tcp:22 } } 
 Anyone here have worked on something similar?

                              <span>Has anyone reading had any experience with using either netbox or nautobot as a source of truth to feed into an automation orchestration system like Ansible specifically for standing up EVPN VXLAN symmetric IRB fabric data centers? There are a lot of unique data point relationships that the data models don&#x27;t handle out of the box. There are some free plugins, but nothing substantial without doing some significant customization it seems. For example, with a pool of VLANs which fabric VRF are each of the VLANs present in? Or which vlan is used for the IBGP peering within a fabric VRF? Which loopback is the SNAT interface for that VRF? These relationships can be made in static VAR files, but we&#x27;re trying not to do that and use a dynamic source for inventory and variables.

                              <span>Hi guys. I want servers between interfaces to be able to ping each other. Is there a way to configure ICMP for all interfaces on Cisco ASA? Or do I have to allow ICMP traffic on every interface? Thank you.

                              <span>Looking to see if anyone has ever seen similar issues before. A few weeks ago, we started noticing random switchports on the network in various locations in many different L2 domains learning hundreds of mac address on access ports. My initial thought was obviously some time of switching loop. Fast forward a few days, we start seeing the same behavior on multiple (50-100) ports throughout the network. The only commonality between these ports are that they all have a USB-C style docking station attached to them with a laptop. Port-security is helping stop the mac-addresses from overloading, but I&#x27;m curious if anyone has ever ran into something like this? We have tried updating the drivers on the docking station with no avail. Some ports are learning almost a mac-address/second. The mac-addresses seem to be totally random as well. When looking up the OUI, many come back with nothing. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Anyone here have any experience peering with an ISP and receiving the full IPv6 table? In my experience, BGP works much more like an application than a routing protocol so I’m not anticipating any practical difference from managing the v4 table other than the potential size. I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice or can offer any foresight into this.

The places I&#x27;ve worked at in a network role have had management VLANs that we use to access equipment as opposed to using the management interface. Just curious how many of you network gurus out there make use of it on the equipment you manage.

 there are several devices of the above models in our environment and google does not give any clear picture nor I could find and community discussion.
 ​
 TAC recommended to upgrade both of these to 9.3(11) as this one has patch for both the bugs ( allegedly ) and we could not verify the claim.
 ​
 Do any one from our community has faced this issue and should I take word of tac for granted as they are not sharing the documentation which says the patch has fixed both the bugs?

 My networking knowledge is limited,therefore don’t shoot the pianist!
 I have been managing a small school network with 300 hundreds users split by staff,students and guests. 3 VLANs, 3 SSIDs, Core, Staff &amp; Guests. Firewall policies built accordingly. 1 extra VLAN for shared printers.
 We’re now moving to a newer site, 900 users. New network devices.
 I have read about some brands supporting one SSID to multiple VLANs, using RADIUS authentication.
 How does this work, is it a good setup,what pitfalls one should expect? Major points of failure? Performance thoughts worth to mention?

                              <span>Just wanted to get some insight on something that I don&#x27;t have a lot of knowledge / experience with yet.
 I currently work IT at a small / local bank with main building and a single remote branch in the same town. We connect to our primary financial vendor internal networks via an MPLS router at the main building (there&#x27;s also a secondary VPN router for fail-over and we&#x27;re routing certain traffic to a virtual IP but MPLS is the primary route) - just referring to it as the &quot;FI gateway&quot;. Then, there are static routes set up in our firewall which route traffic for certain IP&#x27;s and networks used by bank apps through that FI gateway.
 For the remote branch building, it is connected to the main branch via site-to-site VPN tunnel and the bank apps used there have their traffic routed back to the …</span>

                              <span>Does anyone have Aruba aps and wlcs in their environment in a Cisco only place (all Cisco routers, switches, ISE, etc) and if so how do you mesh your Aruba stuff (APs) with your Cisco switches? I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;m just curious that&#x27;s all. We have a 9800wlc which is just buggy as hell and has been a nightmare so far as we&#x27;ve had issues with phones not been able to connect to the Cisco aironet aps and just general wifi issues.
 It&#x27;s not like we will replace the wlc as we just replaced our old 5508 with this 9800 but yeah just thinking of a scenario where if we would replace it with Aruba stuff then how would it mesh with the Cisco stuff.
 And I asked about Aruba because I know that Aruba aps and wlcs are better than their Cisco equivalents.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi, does the notes I&#x27;ve made below (along with the one question too) sound about right when describing active vs passive authentication? Let&#x27;s assume the firewall I mentioned to is a Firepower device too (not that it would matter anyway)
 Active authentication actively prompts the user to sign in before they try and access a website and then after that it will go through the access policy to see if that user account matches any rules for that username for them to be able to access a particular website. You can specify what managed device (computer/vm) you want the user to see this authentication prompt on when they try and access the internet. When it says authentication method is HTTP basic, what does that mean? Does it mean that the device (firewall) will open a port 80 connection with the domain controller to check to see if the users entreded creds are correct and then authenticate the user? 
 Passive authentication won&#x27;t prompt the user when they&#x27;re on a device and will instead check ISE (which is acting as the user agent) to tell ISE to go and check AD for the ip to user and group mappings for the account that is presented to ISE and then retrieves that info from the DC&#x27;s and builds the connection logs out also uses that information to then go through the access policies and check to see if any rules are hit too 
 These 2 authentication methods only work with 80/443 traffic

                              <span>I have deployed a new netbox vm and followed this guide to migrate the database to the new system (not the json option)
 everything worked perfectly fine and I can see all the data in the new installation, however, noticed that the main search function (all the way top)no longer works for the items that got migrated to the new system, I can manually go to the site/devices and see those. but not using the search option.
 but if I add new items to the netbox, only for those items, the search functionality works as expected.
 For example, suppose I had 10.100.1.1 in the old db, and I added 10.100.1.2 to netbox. 
 When I search with 10.100. in the top search bar, it will now show only 10.100.1.2 which was added newly, not the migrated data.
 Did anyone know how to fix this?
 how to reproduce the issue?
  
Deploy netbox following the official doc in new env.
 dump the database on the old netbox machine.
 migrate the database following the article.
 And search for the items in the migrated db.

At the moment my Wifi network is on the management LAN1, I&#x27;m trying to change it to VLAN 20 but I&#x27;m finding difficulties configuring the tag-untag ports on the Allied Telesis
 On UDM I&#x27;ve configured a profile dedicated with LAN1+VLAN20 and assigned to the port that goes to the Allied switch and I made a test SSID with management on LAN 1 and WIFI on VLAN 20
 On the switch VLAN 1 is untagged on all ports and works fine. VLAN 20 is tagged on the uplink port and untagged on the AP port.
 Configured as this it doesn&#x27;t work, I also tried other combinations but still nothing What am I doing wrong? 
 I&#x27;m self-taught so pardon me if it&#x27;s a banal mistake

                              <span>Edit;
 &quot;We make electronic circuit boards that use ethernet to connect.
 I have a &quot;server PC&quot; just because we need something with a lot of power to push the data across.
 There will be no connection to the internet.
 We have no problem with IT for this we do it all the time, its just I have a particularly &quot;heavy&quot; test to run so the kit we got a few years ago does have enough speed&quot;
 End of Edit
 Hello all, Im a little bit confused looking around at the switches there seem to be so many choices!
 I am working on a project at work, i&#x27;ve asked our IT to give me a hand but they are incredibly busy right now so unlikely to have a response from them for a couple of days.
 Ideally i would like to make my purchases today so I could have them from next week.
 I&#x27;m trying to run a project that will take a 10GB ethernet cable from a server PC.
 This will need to go to a switch that can output to 20 other connected devices.
 These connected devices dont need to be 10gb, so 1gb is fine.
 I keep on coming across devices that have a 10gb fiber connection. and I see you can get adaptors for these ports but most of them are saying adaptor for &quot;insert switch manufacture&quot;, is this a marketing gimmick or is there something that stops them from working with other switch manufacturers?
 ​
 Would some be able to recomend a switch that would work for this?
 ​
 I will need to connect up to 40 devices to this Server but is has a 4 port 10gb switch output so if it makes more economical sense I am happy to get smaller switches.

                              <span>Hi, we are working on an application that includes webrtc based remote support. In trials we noticed in bigger companies, that due to network restrictions, the connection to a turn server didn&#x27;t always work. what would be a good way to find out what a network-client can do in a network? stuff like: which ports can be &quot;addressed&quot; / can i reach ports on my server from within the company network? Turn uses 3478 and 5349 for signalling, but also also a wide range (49152-65535) for media streams. 
 Yes, i&#x27;m aware that the cleanest way is to ask IT, but that usually takes time and triggers a lot of unnecessary back and forth for a demo run.

 The location is actually in NL but we&#x27;ve experienced issues where users can&#x27;t get access to certain sites due to the website thinking they are in the UK.
 On Ripe I see this for the IP block descr: Level 3 NL RIPE block.
 Why is there a discrepancy between different IP lookup tools?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Hope you all having an amazing day.
 I am trying to understand the differences between the below 2 port configuration. The client conencted to these ports are working fine. Whats the effect of having &#x27;switchport mode access&#x27; in the second config?
 What&#x27;s the best practice while creating interfaces? Do i need to use &#x27;switchport mode access&#x27; for all ports where clients will be connected ex. vlan 20?
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/2
 switchport access vlan 20
 spanning-tree portfast
 --------------------------
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/6
 switchport access vlan 20
 switchport mode access
 spanning-tree portfast
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Does anyone have a good contact for Cisco to potentially assist with the recycling of old (EOL) network infrastructure?
 The 501(c)3 youth STEM group I work with here in the Denver area has received donations of gently used Cisco switches and other network infrastructure.
 Now that the older devices are EOL, we can&#x27;t get support (security updates, etc) any more so we need to recycle them.
 Any recommendations for how to do this? I see lots of things on the Cisco site about trade ins with purchase but nothing for just recycling.
 If there are any community minded businesses, the group is open to accepting donations of recent model &quot;gently used&quot; (within manufacturer&#x27;s service life) equipment for the group&#x27;s student run facility on the Eastern plains of Colorado.

                              <span>Someone unscrew my mental confusion.
 Recently a certain department in our company received a very cleverly disguised email. Very similar domain name.
 Looking at the email header the from addresses was not the sending domain but the email passed all checks (e.g., SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
 Where I&#x27;m confused is, I thought DKIM was a protection for spoofing.
 This email came right on in. The transport rule never blinked.
 We have an InfoSec department that&#x27;s investigating and will tell my department what to do but I&#x27;m curious about my confusion.

                              <span>We recently received a contract for a prospective vendor for a large implementation for a cloud-based software platform.
 The platform is SaaS and is geared to integrate with our existing AD authentication for SSO (using an onsite vendor managed server to snchronize AD objects/changes to the vendor&#x27;s backend).
 I don&#x27;t have an issue with the AD integration itself, but the vendor is mandating that password rules be set to a very specific configuration which I feel could pose some security risks.
 At the moment we follow NIST guidelines (larger minimum length and complexity of passwords, checking against leaked password list (HIBP v8), no password expiration, 2FA for external network access, lockout on 5 incorrect attempts).
 The vendor has specified the following changes from our current st…</span>

                              <span>Hey all, we are trying to implement Yubikey for all users within the environment for AD authentication.
 We are struggling to decide the best course of action for 900+ users. I believe we will not be using FIDO2 at this time so our only options are Enroll on Behalf Of for every single user and manually map the cert to their ADuser or send the Yubikeys out and have the users use Self Enrollment. Also we would like these to autorenew every 1-2 years (still deciding on timeframe) but I haven&#x27;t come across a way for the cert to renew and get updated on the Yubikey itself, only a way for the user themselves to renew and put on the Yubikey.
 Trying to get ideas from people that currently use Yubikey and determine the best route forward.

After that, my inbox started filling with replies to that previously deleted message. Apparently, some wonderful person mistakenly sent this email to multiple company-wide distribution lists. For the next several hours, I&#x27;m deleting emails of people in the company that are either asking to be removed from the lists, demands for people to stop hitting reply to all, or the occasional taco recipe (I guess some users are trying to be comedians). Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have a ton of other work that I needed to do today, so I had plenty of time to spend deleting emails, while trying not to miss emails I actually needed to see.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a long career in IT. Started my first help desk job in &#x27;98 without knowing shit. I was a fish out of water but first computers and then larger IT concepts came natural to me. I would have called it seeing the Matrix, but the movie was still a year out from release, so that wasn&#x27;t in the vernacular, but it clicked and felt natural. And became my career. 
 I&#x27;ve done lots of different jobs in IT over the years. Cable-dog - handling everything from outdoor plant all the way to the desktop, copper, fiber, co-ax. I&#x27;ve built and managed data centers for MSPs, I&#x27;ve worked an different help desks, specialized and general. I&#x27;ve worked in DoD contracting, did IT for the USOC, all over the private sector, even helped my buddy stand up his own small IT firm helping local businesses where I use…</span>

                              <span>So I posted here recently about issues we are having where AD users are getting locked out by the Exchange Server. Things have evolved a little and I am certain the lockouts are coming from Exchange, but I have looked through every Exchange/IIS log I can find and I am unable to find corresponding attempts to access these users&#x27; mailboxes. 
 I finally enlisted Microsoft Support after reaching my wits end with this issue and dropped the $500 on a ticket. After a day and a half of intermittently working with them to investigate the issue, they came to the conclusion that...the Exchange server was the source of the lockouts...
 They admitted that I knew that when I submitted the ticket, so they told me they were going to refund the cost of the ticket, but we need to reach out to premier support for a RCA (root cause analysis) as they had reached their limitations in assisting us (they didn&#x27;t even get as far along as I did in my own investigating...). 
 So I reached out to premier support. Where I&#x27;m told you need a premier support contract to get support from them. That contract, I am told, starts at $53,000. $53,000 is what it would cost us to get support from Microsoft, on a Microsoft product, that we already pay heavily for for the &quot;privilege&quot; of using...
 Does this align with anybody else&#x27;s experience? Are there any other options for us that don&#x27;t involve spending $53,000? This just seems absolutely insane to me how useless they are in supporting their products!

                              <span>We have about 500 devices registered in our DEP and MDM. Most are cell phones for manager level or higher. Company is providing the devices because this person is important enough that we need them to be reachable and have access to company data. Because these are manager types we haven&#x27;t really put any restrictions on the phones, the MDM/DEP at this point is just so we can remote wipe or recover PIN after someone is let go. We push one or two LoB apps but they can install whatever apps they want. A few have a separate personal phone but most use the company phone as their only phone, which means all sorts of random apps installed. It&#x27;s interesting to me to see what kinds of apps people have so I look occasionally. Turns out 27 of them have TikTok. 
 So, to block or not to block. That is the question....
 We&#x27;re in manufacturing and don&#x27;t really have any particularly special IP if that makes a difference.

                              <span>Hey I have a specific question that has to do with someone at my job. So we currently have a guy who holds numerous hats in our IT department (sys admin, network admin, security admin and more) my thing is he is trying to gate keep a lot of roles and does not want anyone else (new sys admin, and service desk guys) to have access to certain things like AD, servers, network monitoring tools etc. He’s been here longer than our manager so I believe he makes alot of his own decisions based off his ease of use and comfort which imo should not be the case especially if he is implementing security processes. I feel there would be a lack of true security if it is mainly just benefiting him rather than the company. With that being said I believe we should hire a IT security guy to audit/ work with us but work on a different team. I thought this would be a standard thing but it seems like it’s not am I wrong for thinking this way? Should there not be a IT security guy.

I know people hate seeing we are like family here in a listing. Also, I know government IT doesn&#x27;t fit the fast paced environment cliche but those jobs seem hard to come by. How about competitive salary? Imagine a listing where it says we offer a non competitive salary?

                              <span>I do small scale IT work for 3 car delearships in my area, nothing too crazy, but I&#x27;m constantly being called or asked why their computer is so slow or isn&#x27;t working, and when I show up it&#x27;s working fine to me. They aren&#x27;t very tech savvy so If i ask &quot;What&#x27;s not working or loading?&quot; the response is always something along the lines of everything. They can&#x27;t tell me if it&#x27;s a windows issue or an issue with the browser or website they are trying to use, but granted in some cases I do come to a users machine that take forever to even click the windows start bar or launch an application. I was looking at task manager on one the other day and the CPU and RAM were clocked out from either two tabs of chrome or applications that shouldn&#x27;t be running. 
 I know this is a common thing when it comes to IT work, but I just wanted to get some advice on what I could do to at least make them think the computer is speeding up or actually help that one employee who is actually having the issues. I&#x27;m quite new to IT work especially being the only Tech so I guess an Admin. Any advice or tools that I could utizilize would be greatly appreaciated. 
 I already run ccleaner and Malwarebytes and then uninstall any programs that shouldn&#x27;t be there, even though we have endpoint running on all our pc&#x27;s for viruses but it doesn&#x27;t cause issues unless an update or scan is being performed. 
 Thanks for any help

                              <span>I just want to take a moment to thank Microsoft for batch updating all our 100 users to windows 11, all on the same day….even though we triple and quadruple configured all our deployment profiles to specifically not install any windows 11 update. 
 I feel like the whole intune interface is like those phones for kids, there’s buttons and options but none do anything because Microsoft knows best.
 Get intune they said…it’ll be fun they said.
 Update: While most comments point to a missconfiguration, which I truly believed as well for a while, I&#x27;m still scratching my head as to why this happened in the past couple of days.
 Even so, I can understand that we missed something, but that begs the question, why would this be buried in some obscure settings.
 We have one policy in &quot;Update rings for Windows 10 and later&quot; with an Update Ring Settings &quot;Upgrade Windows 10 devices to Latest Windows 11 release&quot; clearly set to &quot;No&quot; and clearly correctly applying to all corporate devices. This has worked great since Windows 11 released 1 year ago almost, yet today, out of the F*IN blue, without anyone editing anything have I mentioned that?
 Note to self, do not post anything without fully accepting blame, in writing, even if flared as rant.

 Hey, I just wanted to thank everyone for their amazing advice on my last post. Your expertise and kind words helped me take action and improve my situation. Some of you even reached out to me in private to help me out with writing a CV, Configuring the network, fixing the VMware issues and so on, so i feel like i owe you guys an update. 
 I compiled all the evidence I had of rude and stressful interactions with users and wrote out my account of the situation from memory. Then, I printed everything out and went to speak with my workplace leadership. I was acutally shaking so much you could hear the paper move LMAO, but I explained in detail how a certain boss treated me, including how he asked me to break the law to get something he wanted (I had email evidence), and how much it stressed me out when he would be angry that i didn&#x27;t follow through. I also explained how this workload was too much for one person to carry, and the person I spoke with took me seriously, and I was put on sick leave with pay until I can see a doctor. They&#x27;re launching an investigation into that boss starting from the very top, and addressing the rotten workplace culture in a discrete manner.
 I have a doctor&#x27;s appointment on Monday, and I&#x27;ll most likely get a mental health sick note to take some time off. As for the job interview I mentioned, it didn&#x27;t work out because I didn&#x27;t have some Office 365 Certs :D but at least I have time now to look for something better! Also, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW ULTRA CORPORATE THAT PLACE WAS, It almot felt like a cult where everyone was one &quot;giant happy family&quot;! 
 Once again, thank you all for your support and advice. I truly appreciate it and feel like I&#x27;ve played my cards right to improve my situation.

                              <span>Can someone point me in a correct direction? Every article I was able to find on this is talking either about things that aren&#x27;t functional anymore or are talking about Azure Active Directory. Stuff like &quot;Turn on the convenience PIN Sign-in&quot; local GPO
 I just want our users to be able to use PIN and/or the fingerprint reader on their laptops. We don&#x27;t use Intune to manage devices. In fact we barely have a domain (only two things we enforce are passwords and bitlocker).

 We are out of ideas. There is no discernible difference between the users or computers. Tried a lot of different things, for example:
 Made sure the sites were in Trusted Sites. Checked if it&#x27;s a TLS issue. Gone over Defender timeline to see if anything different is there. Compared OS versions. Checked Sharepoint logs. Checked IIS logs.
 The list goes on. Is there anyone here who has had this issue?

Because of he fact that the computer is installed in swedish, The principal accounts have swedish names. I would like to change the name of these accounts to a english name.
 For example i want to change the group &quot;Alla&quot; to Everyone and &quot;Lokal Tjänst&quot; to &quot;Local Service&quot;
 Is it possible to do this without third party programs? If renaming them with powershell is possible then this would be the ideal solution.

                              <span>So, change in management has led to a change in ideology for naming endpoint computers.
 I prefer to just use the device serial number (usually a Dell TAG so 7 characters). new boss wants [unit]-[initial][surname] (e.g. COY-KSmith) type host names. FWIW we had 3 Kevin Smiths at one point. 
 I prefer the abstracted and unique option, mostly for simplicity as the name is printed on the device by the manufacturer. He prefers the generated name so it&#x27;s easy to guess what a user&#x27;s computer is called. 
 We are using SCCM so I feel it&#x27;s easy enough to get to the host via the username, plus I see no benefit with adding a manual tier to this process that will need maintenance if a laptop is reassigned, or replaced. 
 I&#x27;m interested to know what does the community think about this? not so much a what do you do questions, we all have our systems that we just do because we&#x27;ve always done it this way, but if you think about it as a green field exercise, what seems reasonable? My issue is I can see his point, and there are some merits to it, but not enough IMO.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 ​
 We have 2016 AD DS environment.
 ​
 - 2012R2 AD CS machine
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on AD CS machine. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 My question is : Has anyone had any problems after changing this hardening?
 thanks,

 I&#x27;m having the issue where Skype takes over the focus while i&#x27;m working in Citrix for example.
 I&#x27;ve tried to empty the cache of skype but that doesn&#x27;t do anything.
 ​
 Any help would be really appreciated.
 Kind regards

                              <span>I have a small environment with WSUS for updates approval.
 Right now, we don&#x27;t have any strategy for testing the updates. I just approve them in a regular basis. (I have automatic approval for Defender definitions and Edge updates.)
 Although I know that&#x27;s NOT the best option, I don&#x27;t really know how can I manage the updates.
 I think I&#x27;d need a test group of clients for receiving the updates first. Then, after a period of time, I&#x27;d approve these updates to all production clients.
 By clients, I mean servers and desktops/laptops.
 I&#x27;d like to know from you, what would be the best options/practices to manage WSUS.

                              <span>I read a series of comments (that I can’t find with Search) discussing whether RAID alone can be considered HA. Some said Yes by confining the scope of the analysis to the drives.
 Others pointed out that a single RAID controller or power supply failure would defeat the HA nature of the RAID drives.
 Wikipedia states:
 There are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.
 Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system. Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover. Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must. ....
 It strikes me that there is an important distinction between having some redundant components and having no single point of failure.
 I can see that RAID alone has good capacity to improve availability, but I wouldn’t say RAID is HA. What’s your view?
 Edit: good replaces limited

 On one hand, I&#x27;d like not to just rely on a simple Excel sheet because of the amount of devices - on the other hand, I&#x27;d prefer NOT to go all in and invest in a huge software package for this.
 When a student shows up to borrow, say, a ChromeBook, I don&#x27;t want to spend 15 minutes registrering this, finding serials, getting signatures etc.
 Preferably, I&#x27;d like it to land somewhere in the middle of these two solutions, so it&#x27;s easy for me to 
 We have around 1,000 devices.

                              <span>Is Microsoft putting our security at risk? As of now, it is widely known that Microsoft has delayed the implementation of the MFA number matching enable-by-default setting, originally scheduled for February 27, 2023, to May 8, 2023.
 But first of first, why? What&#x27;s the deal with Microsoft delaying this key security upgrade? Why are they pushing it back so far? 
 But I guess the delay might be to give organizations enough time to switch over to using number match for Microsoft Authenticator with push notifications. This is a big deal because it adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to confirm their sign-in attempts with an additional secured factor. Plus, the delay will give organizations a chance to properly test and set up their MFA policies, so they won&#x27;t cause any issues!

                              <span>So I have around 6 tickets in my queue that I have been chasing users for over a week now. 
 A common example that I am going through is one below: 
 They raise the ticket and add a sentence of &quot;Please help! I’m having to work on and share a lot of files at the minute so this is really slowing me down. &quot; 
 Yep no problem, try to contact them - busy. No problem, leave a message to contact me asap to have the issue looked at. They reply that they will after this call or within an hour or so. 1 - 2 days later still no reply so I chase. No reply. A week later they get back to me saying that the issue is becoming increasingly urgent and they are unable to work. No problem - call them right away to be told that they only have 5 minutes before they have to go....
 Why does this keep happening?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Just wondering if I am missing something. Looking at options to add a GPU to improve performance on our Remote Desktop Session Hosts. Currently all RDSH Servers are VMs Virtualized using Hyper-V as the Hypervisor.
 By the looks of it I need a Enterprise NVidia GPU that is compatible with the Server (Dell PowerEdge R640 for example can support an NVIDIA T4 GPU).
 However reading online, Microsoft have removed vGPU / RemoteFX Support from Windows Server 2016 Build 1084. So this is a no go.
 I think I need the following:
 &gt; An Enterprise Driver License from NVidia
 &gt; A physical GPU installed in a Server, for example the NVIDIA T4
 &gt; A Hypervisor that supports vGPU
 Looking on the NVidia Website, it looks like this is only supported using the following Hypervisors:
 &gt; VMWare vSphere
 &gt; Citrix Hypervisor 8.4
 Both of the above Hypervisors are incredibly expensive in terms of licensing. If I use what I currently have (Hyper-V - Server 2019) this would not allow vGPU or Remote FX, but would only allow physical mapping, so 1 x Physical GPU directly mapped using DDA to the Guest VM RDSH.
 Am I missing something here, how are other enterprises adding Shared vGPUs to their Virtualised RDSH VMs to improve performance? Or is this exactly why VMWare / Citrix are still in business?

 My thought was creating a Task to just keep tabs on if that service is running or not, not 100% sure how to do it.

 Has anyone else had this problem? if so how did you fix it?

 Thank you for any response

                              <span>Hi. See topic. At first I was thinking of something like IaS: Ansible / terraform. But I don&#x27;t have too much experience with those tools. After thinking a bit more, I think at least Ansible is out of the question, because I cannot boot off from the local harddrive, when I want to write an image to that same harddrive. So it needs network boot or boot from USB (which is the same as over network with an IPMI-solution and a simulated virtual flash drive attached)... What would you suggest for automatic restoring something like a clone-zilla backup image?

 So trying to explain what is generally happening at my workplace. A big family-owned company in Midwest. 1500 employees. 1200ish workstations. 120 windows and Linux servers in total. I started in the helpdesk after working years in a different department. Took the test and passed. We had about 6 infrastructure guys which includes my main manager. Then there is the CIO who isn&#x27;t very technical at all. More of a mouthpiece that communicates what is possible with our main database and application intranet and website. Basically just tells the devs what to do but never involved himself in infrastructure and let my manager and his main group of guys take that on. Generally, most people in dept don&#x27;t respect him and think he&#x27;s an idiot. Before 2020 we lost two guys …</span>

 - Once logged in, you are presented with a table of the VLANs configured on the network, with a &quot;friendly name&quot;, IP subnet, a total of devices on the VLAN, etc. You can use arrow keys to scroll through the list, with Enter selecting the VLAN and proceeding into the next screen.

                              <span>For context, I am not a system administrator. I am a developer who handles a few web applications hosted on a DMZ server (or network?). Since they are my web applications, it is my job to ensure the servers stay updated and our wildcard certificates are installed.
 I didn’t really know what to do or how to do it so I kind of just guessed. I had the certificate file and the PFX file (assuming this was the key.) I double-clicked the PFX, put in the password, and it installed. I bound it in IIS with the correct Site and it looked like it worked! Hooray, lol.
 But when I looked into it further I noticed it installed the certificate under the Personal folder. I also noticed there were plenty of other certificate stores/folders in the CertMgr. 
 So my question is, what do these other folders entail? Are they simply just for organization or does each folder hold a different set of policies/security so it truly does matter where the certificate is installed to? 
 I tried Google and it led me to another post in this sub, but it only confused me more lol. Any help would be appreciated or if you can point me in the right direction that would be great!

 So I&#x27;ve been working as a Linux administrator so far (around 2 years) and was offered a position called &quot;IT Application Administrator&quot;
 The IT team member emphasised the word &quot;Application&quot;. The role will involve setting up applications on Linux servers e.g. setting up a Web server, configurations, installing the application, some security and testing stuff etc. &quot;Plan-build-run&quot;. 
 Ansible will be used for automation. Maybe some shell scripting. I will obviously be using the command line a lot.
 The part that I won&#x27;t be doing is actually creating the VM/setting up the server and I probably won&#x27;t be monitoring the infrastructure. 
 Even then, this seems like a Linux role to me? I asked him and he seemed hesitant to call it that.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m currently stuck with the following problem:
 Environment:
 - RDS-Farm (Gateways, Connection Broker, Session Hosts - all W2019 Servers)
 - the RDP-Connection is triggered via the RDP-File downloaded from RDWeb-Page
 ​
 Problem:
 - I start RDP-File in my W11 client, enter the credentials (MFA is also triggered) and the logon works 
 - I start RDP-File #2 (different Username) and the Username from the first connection is the default value. I change to &quot;user different account&quot;, enter the second credentials but the MFA is still triggered with the account of the first session.
 ​
 Ho do i get W11 to ALWAYS use the provided username/password? It seems, that there&#x27;s some kind of cache or something that.
 ​
 I hope the explanation is understandable :-)
 ​
 any tipps would be appreciated. 
 ​
 thx and cheers from austria

                              <span>I recently left a Glassdoor review for a company I interviewed with, but didn&#x27;t end up getting the job. I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.
 To be honest, I&#x27;m not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I&#x27;ve been job searching since I got laid off, and I don&#x27;t care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.
 The hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there&#x27;s a job opportunity for me. But I&#x27;ve been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don&#x27;t believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.
 I admit, I&#x27;m curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I&#x27;m not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?
 I&#x27;m open to any honest feedback and opinions. Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Good Evening Everyone,
 I wanted to get the insight of some other people within the system administration field. What I&#x27;m looking to better understand is at what point does administration become engineering. Based on my experience the line is thin and dependent on the organization that you work for. The way I&#x27;ve reasoned this out in my head in the past is that administration is mainly monitoring/maintaining while engineering tends to be more focused on the planning/creation/building of infrastructure.
 It appears that a lot of employers tend to blur these lines. Though it could just be skewed perspective based on my experience. I&#x27;d like to have some idea of where this line is so that I can better educate and prepare myself when negotiating with my current employer and/or other potential employers.

                              <span>One of the fun parts of my job and my team is looking out across the company and finding areas where automation could be rather helpful. However we don&#x27;t have to look far because people come to use begging usually.
 This week I discovered a &quot;solution&quot; created by a helpful guy that was mostly doing the desired job but he reached our to me for help. This guy made this elaborate python &quot;thing&quot; to do some stuff on excel. I was both impressed and horrified. The &quot;helpful guy&quot; was rather sad that I solved the requirements in three hours with VBA and significantly less lines of code.
 That got me thinking, how do others determine what solution set is best for a given requirement. My team has broad skills. For example I do powershell, VBA, HTML, CSS, Javascript and if I&#x27;m really pushed to it, .net. Others are equally diverse but we have a REST guy that consumes APPIs like candy. Got another in Microsoft power platform and on.
 So when we get a request, usually I can look at it and push it to the best solution based on my experience.
 How do others handle that?

 How can you verify identity with relying on security questions that they may forget anyway or asking them personal things that you shouldn’t have access to like DOB or last 4 of SSN or relying on the security of mobile phone numbers and SMS?

 Instead of: &quot;You need to run the desktop version of Outlook.&quot; Instead: &quot;Install/run the desktop version of outlook.&quot; 
 Instead of: &quot;I don&#x27;t purchase licenses, you&#x27;ll need to talk to your boss.&quot; Instead: &quot;The company does not provide licensing for this software. Reach out to xxx to see if this has been budgeted and then reach out to xxx for purchasing.&quot; 
 I think this style of writing benefits me because it depersonalizes the message, and lessens confrontations. I think it&#x27;s worked very well! What do YOU think?

                              <span>On two of my accounts now (work, personal) I&#x27;ve received several abrupt &quot;emergency maintenance&quot; notices about migrations of my dedis to new hardware. When the boxes come back up on the &quot;new hardware&quot;, they&#x27;re running weaker processors with slower memory. (Can&#x27;t help but notice the price hasn&#x27;t gone down to reflect this loss of power...) I&#x27;ve destroyed my personal systems and migrated to cheaper shared instances because &quot;whatever&quot;, but at work, the new power differences between a few of my Docker Swarm worker nodes is creating imbalance where there was none before.
 Call my a cynic, but is this Akamai&#x27;s influence bleeding in already? Seems pretty coincidental the big company comes in and suddenly my services are getting their corners cut off in a way that doesn&#x27;t require them to lower vCPU or memory counts on their plans. Is this happening to anyone else?

 Last week we had a meeting to discuss the slowness issue of our app. Yes it has gotten considerably worse over the past six months. The three teams involved were county networking team, facility IT, contractor team, App Dev team. It took a meeting that also included all management inside the facility to complain about the app slowness and to get someone inside our facility to fix it. My facility managers arranged everything with the county network team, but I supplied IP addresses and the names of the users who were always complaining about slowness. I also showed the county network IT guys how users get on a fresh PC and how slow the app is. They agreed that there was a problem and worked their magic in the background.
 24 hours later users are experiencing a much better and faster virtual environment. They are thanking me left and right for fixing the issue, but all I did was complain to management every day for the past six months. Is this how it feels to be successful?

                              <span>We use polycom vvx 450 voip phones in our organziation. Our security department uses powerful two way radios to communicate around our campus. If you take one of those radios and hit the transmit button next to one of our polycom phones while talking on the phone, it will immediately disconnect the phone call. Has anyone seen this before and/or have any ideas on how to prevent this from happening? We&#x27;ve told them to not use their radios near the phones but in an emergency situation where they&#x27;re talking to 911 they need to be able to use both at the same time without having to walk away from the phone to use the radio.

                              <span>Cheap HP printers have become the bain of my life, they are truly awful. Even this simplest cheapest printer now requires an internet connection otherwise it will stop printing. As the toner runs low it try to connect to its supply services to prompt you to buy new tone at exorbitant prices.
 I keep telling users DO NOT buy HP printers but they are cheap because they make their money on consumables. They are now more trouble than they are worth. I&#x27;ve been installing printers from A4 to A0 LED and laser printers for 25 years and have come to the point that these printers are a waste of time and effort. Users end up paying more for support on these printers than the printers cost and is false economy.

                              <span>So, i volunteer as a sysadmin for two non profit organizations. One of them just underwent a yearly audit, which, for the first time, included an IT audit. Note that this is an org with 12 staff, and no IT department. The single server is an Intel NUC, located in a wall mounted rack in the store room.
 I just got the report back, we failed on the following counts: 1. No penetration test done in the past 12 months. 2. Not enforcing 6 week password rotation (for local non admin accounts on their laptops) 3. No raised floors in the server room 4. No biometric security control for the server room 5. No aircon in the server room 6. Not encrypting off site backups 7. Running both windows 10 and windows 11 on the same network
 I now need to write a rebuttal to the auditors for this travesty of an audit.
 Wwyd
 Note, i love the organization, and they are not to bland
 Also note, this is in extremely rural Africa

                              <span>Hello,
 We have DBAs dumping Oracle RMAN backups to an NFS target. We need to replicate those backup files to a 2nd site. The storage devices at each site are different, so we need something that can do host-based replication.
 The RMAN backups are fulls each night, and looking for something smart enough to not send a full backup to the second site each time. I was looking at rsynch and it has a block level synch option, would that possibly work? 
 My main concerns are if the full RMAN dumps would trigger rsynch to send a full each time this won&#x27;t work, but if it&#x27;s smart enough to only send changed blocks each night this should be workable. The initial full will be the worst in terms of host impact and time, we will seed it locally if possible.
 Are there better tools for this type of host based copy approach? DBAs do not want a formal agent-based backup app, I understand there are better approaches. Dealing with what we have on hand right now and seeking feedback around rsynch or other 3rd party tools.
 Thank you!

 I was hoping some you more seasoned SA&#x27;s could help me out. We recently were notified that our Information System Security Officers (ISSO) need to have access to the windows logs on a very small network, which consists of, 6 desktops, and 3 servers. Now, I have log forwarding setup to have the logs sent to our File Server. What would be the best way to get the ISSOs access to the logs on that server without giving them admin accounts?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m trying to work on something using the API for Tanium. I see in their doc: Reference: API Gateway examples (tanium.com) that they share an example: &quot;Perform an action operation (mutation.actionPerform)&quot;
 I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone has translated this into a curl or powershell script?
 ​
 In the past, I&#x27;ve only worked with the query API, so something similar to:
 $h &#x3D; blahblah
 { endpoints(filter: {op: CONTAINS, path: &quot;name&quot;, value: &quot;&#x27; + $h + &#x27;&quot;}) { edges { node { id name domainName ipAddress lastLoggedInUser model manufacturer } } } }&#x27;
 ​
 I&#x27;m also wanting to target the endpoints: [ID!] field instead of platform (In the example). I&#x27;m not sure however, to piece together the chain: Get the ID, Pass the ID and Add Tag: XXX.
 ​
 If you have done, or similar examples, let me know please.

                              <span>Mandatory preface: Yes, I’ve searched through previous posts to no avail. No, I’m not asking for a recommendation (and know there are several posts available for that).
 With that said, I’m tasked with replacing our on premise PBX and have evaluated several service providers for this purpose.
 Current contenders include 8x8, RingCentral, GoTo, and Ultatel.
 I’ve been able to find the information I need to make an informed decision on each of those with the exception of Ultatel.
 Does anyone have experience with them? How did it go/ how is it going? Their pricing is very aggressive and solution appears to include all the features we need (our requirements for a phone system are pretty simple compared to most).
 Thanks in advance

 Other User
 Guest
 ​
 But this is not appearing on all systems. Of course, it&#x27;s appearing on the systems we don&#x27;t want it and not appearing on the systems we want it on (or at least not all of them). I&#x27;m not even sure what those option buttons are called so I&#x27;ve been failing in my googlefu. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a set of GPOs or registry keys that need to be changed that is carrying something over from when they were on local AD to being on Azure.
 Is there anyone that can point me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hi everyone, please bear with me as I go crazy as I try to get a bit of information in a sane way. I work for a training company with UK gov funding and I need to automate getting the meeting attendance. 
 I have tried the 0365 reports script, but it only gets random meetings and nothing useful, even if I give it dates.
 My plan would be to:
  
Create alll meetings under a user
 Get all meetings for that user (they are available on Teams admin, power automate desktop might be a possibility to download them?)
 use a slightly modified script that we have to populate out attendance sheets.
  
Essentially, all it need to do is to automate getting the meeting attendance from team admin (I noticed that downloading the attendance register from teams itself sometimes fails, so I want something durable and the reports on Teams admin are simple and to the point) 
 Also, all the meetings are team meetings, so that is another limitation.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I used to do IT work at an MSP for hillbillies in the panhandle of Florida for a couple of years and it was very back breaking work but I ended up learning a lot of aspects such that I would consider myself a Tier 2 in terms of skill. I recently moved to Miami and got picked up by a very top shelf corporate company. It&#x27;s one of the most sought out due to their benefits and I&#x27;ve heard other techs had to apply 17 times to get their jobs so I assumed I would be surrounded by the top of the top. Instead, it&#x27;s been 4 months and I can confirm I&#x27;m surrounded by some of the laziest inept workers I have ever seen. No one wants to work, tickets are constantly needing to be reopened, users always complaining. Some techs even get written up several times a month but have still been with the company for 4 years because &quot;they never fire&quot;.
 This is my first venture into Corporate IT for a large company of around 20,000 employees but I already feel like 80% of the IT department are milking checks. Is this the same across the majority of big companies like this? Should I bother staying with them if i spend more time patching up others mistakes rather than learning something new? I will admit that there are definetly career oppurtunies as most people working in IT support here are so bad my manager has considered making me a IT Tech Tier III Lead but my past jobs would have pinned me as Tier 1.5-2 in skill (fake it till you make it lol)

 so I&#x27;m kinda staying infront the wall here.
 Short Background----
 I&#x27;m writing PowerShell scripts for our company and I&#x27;m have around 50 of them on Task Scheduler. Logging, Version Control its fine, working and documented. 
 I want now to have a monitor where I&#x27;m on top layer monitoring all of them, where I can orchester them better and more friendly for others and surely for me to. 
 ​
 Anyone at the same point where I am, anyone got something that is lightweight. Appreciated !

SO that&#x27;s why I looking for any SolidWorks PDM admins that able to help me here. 
 We have 2018 Solidworks PDM which the MSP installed back in the day, they didn&#x27;t leave the installer nor license info. In the license manager I can transfer the license but am not able to see the PDM license itself, is there away to see the license? Our head engineer needs to get his hands on it so he can shop around for their next version of CAD.

                              <span>If you needed to install a new product on your systems, what is the ideal way that it could be packaged?
 I&#x27;m working on a small productivity tool and I want to wrap it up nicely for distribution, but figuring out the best practice for today is really tricky!
 The tool is installed per-user, and it sets up a couple of file associations and global hotkeys. In principle I could do all of that programmatically within the application, and simply distribute it as a standalone exe. Would an MSI/App-V/MSIX container be preferable to that? And what should it contain?
 Curious to hear what it&#x27;s like from a sysadmins perspective :)

                              <span>I was a subscriber to the Rackspace hosted Exchange service. They started having downtime on Friday, December 2nd at 2 AM and by 6 AM on Saturday had revealed that they experienced a security incident. So I immediately switched off onto a CPanel account that I have just to get my email back up and running (it was just one email address). I finally got access to the restore of my PST file. So what I have is the following at this point: 
  
An 86 GB PST file with email from 2018 to December 2nd, 2022.
 Emails form December 3rd through today that I use WHM/Cpanel to host. It&#x27;s Maildir format if that helps. I use Thunderbird to check it.
  
What I&#x27;d like to wind up with is getting onto Office 365 and import the PST file. That should be straightforward. However, how can I take the email from December 3rd until now and get that into Office 365? Perhaps I could setup a separate Outlook account with IMAP that pulls from my CPanel mail account and then just drag the emails from IMAP into my new Office 365 account?
 Or does anyone else have a suggestion on how I could accomplish this?
 Thanks,
 John

I worked for AOL and got the &quot;broken coffee cup&quot; and &quot;where&#x27;s the ANY key&quot; call -- not just once, but several times each. Working for Dell Gold Tech Support in the early 2010s, I repeatedly got the &quot;cat call,&quot; wherein something had happened to cause the user&#x27;s video to be inverted on the monitor. It was almost invariably a cat walking across the screen, hence the name. A quick, &quot;Press CTRL+ALT+Up,&quot; and the problem was resolved. 
 But no, my dumbest support call from an end user EVER was from a mid-30s lady who did medical research to find new uses for a therapeutic drug we made on-site. Her PhD total count was, as she stated, &quot;an embarrassingly high number (she had 3 and was working on a 4th at the time).&quot; She was a brilliant woman, an excellent hu…</span>

                              <span>We need to apply a new baseline server template using the CIS benchmark template for Level 1. Our organization has multiple windows server OS versions ranging from 2016 to 2022 windows servers. We have created a new baseline using the template for Server 2022 and was wondering if that can be used in a GPO to apply to the OU containing servers of various versions? The documentation states it can be used for Server 2022 and lower versions but do I need to apply a new GPO using the template specific to each OS and if so, how is that accomplished?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Been a reader of this group for a long time and first time posting. Just looking for others that are in a similar situation as I am and how the F&amp;*k you do it.
 A little about my situation: I’m a one-man IT shop. We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.
 On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and ~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and ~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.
 In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.
 Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)
 Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.
 I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.
 Opinions? Comments? Am I just plain stupid for putting up with this crap?

 I guess something tiered with the ability to lock out leavers quickly etc?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve reached a point of frustration on this one because I&#x27;m so close I can taste it, but I just can&#x27;t quite get the last piece, and it&#x27;s pissing me off.
 Using MECM to upgrade from older versions of Windows 10 to newer ones and we&#x27;ve got machines with Symantec Encryption Desktop (SED) on them.
 The task sequence does the following:
  
Stages SED files needed for whole disk encryption admin account to do its job.
 Copies files from above to admin account&#x27;s profile
 Enables SED bypass. (pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)
 Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade
 Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers
 Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10
 Restart computer
 Re-register the SED password filter
 Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)
 Reboot
 Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)
 Uninstall SED
 The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.
  
The issue I&#x27;m having is that the &quot;pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa&quot; command is failing after the upgrade.
 The error I&#x27;m getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey&#x3D;f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&amp;CommunityKey&#x3D;8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&amp;tab&#x3D;digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427
 Which references Linux.
 The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.
 So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn&#x27;t sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won&#x27;t run until SED finishes starting, but I&#x27;m not sure SED&#x27;s underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.
 It&#x27;s also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.

                              <span>I&#x60;m not sure if this is a classic microsoft thing, but we experienced a problem regarding Office 365 installation with ms project 2019. If you open a project file from a network share it takes 5-10 minutes to open a file. We didn&#x27;t find anything related to this problem.
 Our solution was to install Office 2019 with Project 2019 and then the project files from the network shares open normally in 2~5 seconds.
 Did you expierence something similar with MS Project and network shares? What was your solution?

                              <span>Dear fellow sysadmins, 
 a client of mine wants to find a way to manage their parking spots on two office locations. It&#x27;s like 10 parking spots at each office.
 They&#x27;d like to have an overview what is available, pre-book for visiting clients and obviously for people who are in the office.
 It&#x27;d be great if some of you could share your experience in tackling this problem.
 My original approach would be to go with a shared outlook calendar for each parking spot, but maybe there are kickass SaaS tools or even open-source solutions for this problem?
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>Hi guys. I&#x27;m drawing up a list of criteria for a POC that we plan to have with an anti-virus solution. I&#x27;ve covered the high-level stuff e.g. must be cloud-based, lightweight footprint on machines, ability to disable removable drives, must work on multiple OSs, etc. What other criteria would you consider? Obviously it must detect malware; just wondering if there is anything obvious I&#x27;ve missed.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the middle of migrating server 2012 r2 servers to 2022. I want to deploy my printers by using Printer Management. Currently deploying printers by using item level targeting but that causes slow login times for users on remote desktop servers.
 I got a dc running on 2012 and new one on 2022. When deploying printers I cannot find &#x27;Deployed Printers&#x27; in the group policy management on the dc running 2022. But I can find it under the dc running 2012 r2 group policy management. The dc&#x27;s are in sync.
 Anyone got input how I can solve this?
 Update: Just found out Microsoft removed this option in server 2022 because of the PrintNightmare vulnerability.

 I searched for alternatives but would like to know what your daily goto application for connecting to RDP/SSH is?

I&#x27;ve always just cleared cache or reinstalled the app and it was ready to go, but recently many of these issues have been repeating for the same people from the same part of the office. When you connect to a DATA hotspot, everything works fine, which means it&#x27;s a network problem. 
 What do you think could be causing this problem? Is it some kind of firewall settings? 
 Thank you for your help...

                              <span>Hello,
 I blocked most if not all file sharing websites such as Onedrive, Google Drive and and so on to avoid receiving ransomwares (we used to receive random &quot;hey, here&#x27;s the file you requested&quot; spoofing mails with a malicious link on onedrive mainly) so people have to ask me before they can access any link, unless it&#x27;s a trusted source such as the client&#x27;s own sharepoint. 
 The obvious problem is that I have to weekly authorize some websites because our clients use them some times. Everytime, I connect to our fortigate and change the web filtering exceptions.
 My question is : what is your approach regarding this, and is there a more streamlined way to do this ? Do you think it makes sense to block all sharing websites (we have our own hosted solution for sharing things, but some clients use their own and sometimes we simply cannot ask to reupload something they just sent us) ?
 I&#x27;m running on Fortigate and I don&#x27;t know any internal tool that can do that, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong ? 
 I wish there was some sort of Outlook addin with fortinet where I can select a link and authorize it for a short period without having to connect to the FW directly.

                              <span>Hi there, I have a service account authenticated to a DC from a server. I need to find out where this authentication came from. Have checked Services, scheduled tasks etc and couldn’t find the account. 
 Is there any tool I can run to capture the authentication?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Our organization is currently using a local Active Directory (AD) to manage user identities and resources, but we&#x27;re interested in exploring a hybrid Azure AD solution. We want to take advantage of the benefits of cloud-based identity management while still maintaining our on-premises infrastructure. However, we&#x27;re new to Azure AD and aren&#x27;t sure where to start. 
 What are some best practices or tips for upgrading a local AD to a hybrid Azure AD environment? And what challenges should we be prepared for during the transition?

                              <span>Being on site, an half hour ago, I&#x27;ve remotely updated the Windows OS of my jumpbox that is upstair in my server room. 
 Restarted the machine and it disappear from the network.
 No ping answer, no nslook resolution, no remote wake up answer. Times goes on... Nothing...
 My mind instantly start to think to corrupted Active Directory, corrupted DNS, DHCP problems, duplicated hostname or SID or ip with consequent network disruption ...
 ... things that are not really happening in my network since 20 years...
 I run to the server room and saw the PC looks turned on. So I turned on the monitor just to see a veeam recovery menu showing on the monitor. Then I noticed an usb key plugged in.
 I&#x27;ve plugged that key a couple of days before for burning a Linux ISO on it and I have completely forgotten it because I was called for another task.
 So, removing the usb and restarting the system solved all the problems.
 ​
 The fact is that everytime something happens I start thinking to the worst nightmare. And I think that&#x27;s not really healthy for me. Or for troubleshooting things.
 ​
 I think also that this mindset is a consequence of this work. If you experienced something like that in the past you know what I&#x27;m talking about. You cannot forget.
 ​
 But I think this is totally unealthy and an insane mindset.
 ​
 Perhaps it is part of a impostor syndrome cause you know, this world is so big, for a One Man Show that must know everything (in no time).
 ​
 In any case, just to say, is it just me or also you have this insane way of thinking?

 An external prospecting company that will call and mail our prospecting list wants their own mailbox from our domain.
 Would anyone know if there is an other way to handle this? We don&#x27;t like to give someone external access to a mailbox of ours.
 Thanks!

It is basically an east west firewall solution based on azure nsg where I had accidentally pushed and any any allow rule few months back.

                              <span>Hey dear community, We are planning to support DNS over TLS on our DNS servers but we wanna know what portion of DNS clients really support DoT?
  
which clients supports DoT and which not (the ones you know like Windows, cisco devices, linux servers)
 For now both Standart DNS and DoT should be available, because disabling standart DNS may cause some clients fail to query?
 when client supports DoT, it acts like 1) check if DoT/DoH supported use them otherwise use standart UDP DNS? or how clients knows which protocol to use for communication

                              <span>Hi guys
 ​
 In the next 2 weeks I have my final exam and I thought about building a Hyper-V-Cluster (2 Servers) with one SAN as the storage. Now the storage makes some problems and I was thinking I just take another server and build up a iSCSI-Storage-Target with the 2 Hyper-V Servers as Initiators, sadly this also won&#x27;t work because that isn&#x27;t the purpose of iSCSI... (just one iSCSI-Initiator possible)
 ​
 Is there like a workaround? I was thinking about building 2 iSCSI LUN&#x27;s and synchronise those somehow, is this possible?

 The reason to avoid, say, Google drive or other cloud based options is due to PII&#x27;s and regulations.

                              <span>Hello!
 I was hoping I could get some help with an issue, I&#x27;ve been voluntold to configure an IPSEC connection with a client and my networking experience is limited to a CCNA I did nearly a decade ago before being hired as a coder. So I&#x27;m getting out a brush and getting the rust off. 
 Anyways,
 I&#x27;ve gotta provide an Encryption Domain space for our end of the IPSEC connection. Would this be the address space attached to our &#x27;outside&#x27; port 192.168.0.0/28 or the &#x27;inside&#x27; port 192.168.2.0/28?
 I&#x27;ve been able to ascertain that the domain would be the address space meant to traverse the tunnel but I haven&#x27;t found an answer as to which address space I should provide.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We are currently evaluating both viptela and fortigate sd-wan products for SD-WAN deployment across 400 sites. As we are about to start the POCs I feel both has the capability to achieve our requirement, if someone has gone through this process in the past please share how did it go. We have viptela image capable isr4000 series routers in half of the sites while others with isr g2 routers. Almost half of the sites have redundant mpls links+ ADSL internet, while the other half has redundant Internet links with different ISP+ cellular as standby. We need application based routing, sla based routing for voip, local internet breakout etc.

                              <span>I am currently working with IOL Cisco devices in a virtual lab and have a collapsed core design. I have 2 core/distribution switches. On core 1 I have configured SVI for each VLAN. I want a second core switch (Core 2) to be able to take/distribute load while acting like a backup switch if Core1 goes down. Each access switch should have a redundant link to both Core1 and Core2. What configuration/technology should I look into to help me accomplish the redundant core switch?
 One option I have looked at include HSRP but that seems to be only for routers and not for SVI interfaces. I have also looked at VSS but I lack the hardware to test this feature.
 Link to my simple topology.

 Hoping someone can answer this question for me pretty easily. There are two options for getting a virtual ASA in AWS marketplace. One is listed as BOL and the other is PAYG. My question is if you subscribe to the PAYG model, does that INCLUDE the cicso ASA license in the price or would that have to be a separate purchase like the BOL model? Here is the subscription in question:
 AWS Marketplace: Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Virtual - PAYG with 30-Day Free Trial (amazon.com)
 Spoke with AWS support and the basically said talk to cisco so here I am hoping someone can give me a straight answer on it. Can&#x27;t seem to get anything concrete and cant talk with cisco support without having a subscription. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>So at my current job we are phasing in Cato networks SDWAN appliances and are looking to roll them to other sites. The question I have is are any of you using their products and what are the pros and cons? 
 I see them as solid for SMB infrastructure, but not really enterprise/datacenter ready. 
 We are currently running on proper enterprise gear like Cisco, PaloAlto, Fortinet, etc. 
 What, if any, would be a reason to stick with our known products that perform as expected to something like Cato?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 Having a strange issue. All of the sudden, iPhone users can&#x27;t get internet through my AP&#x27;s, although they can connect to them, while Android users, and all of the Windows laptops are fine. I have a mix of Cisco 1702&#x27;s, 1602&#x27;s, and 1261&#x27;s. Have reloaded AP&#x27;s, changed patch cords, rebooted switches, cleared DHCP, but nothing works. They can associate just fine, they just get no internet and the phone shows IP addresses &quot;0.0.0.x&quot; (i.e. 0.0.0.120, 0.0.0.55, etc...). Checked GPO, nothing applied that would be preventing Apple devices.
 At this point I have to imagine it&#x27;s a setting on the devices themselves, but wondering if anyone has ran into anything similar? It&#x27;s ALL Apple devices, not just one. And again, Android and Windows devices are all just fine.

 Having a strange issue. All of the sudden, iPhone users can&#x27;t get internet through my AP&#x27;s, although they can connect to them, while Android users, and all of the Windows laptops are fine. I have a mix of Cisco 1702&#x27;s, 1602&#x27;s, and 1261&#x27;s. Have reloaded AP&#x27;s, changed patch cords, rebooted switches, cleared DHCP, but nothing works. They can associate just fine, they just get no internet and the phone shows IP addresses &quot;0.0.0.x&quot; (i.e. 0.0.0.120, 0.0.0.55, etc...). Checked GPO, nothing applied that would be preventing Apple devices.
 At this point I have to imagine it&#x27;s a setting on the devices themselves, but wondering if anyone has ran into anything similar? It&#x27;s ALL Apple devices, not just one. And again, Android and Windows devices are all just fine.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a small setup with a few cameras wired up to a hikvision NCR with an internet breakout through a 4G capable router.
 The problem is that the provider assigns me a private IP and I set behind their small pool of public IPs hence no capability of reaching my NCR to watch the cameras.
 The only idea I&#x27;ve had so far is to bring up an L2TP to a third location which has a public IP and bounce my monitoring through there, but looks expensive and complicated.

                              <span>Greetings my fellow networkers,
 I&#x27;ve discovered NeDi recently and I tried to set it up in our enterprise environment. I deployed it on a fresh VM with the latest Debian release (v11.6).
 I installed NeDi via the bash(version 2.2.22) I found on the website which works perfectly but I&#x27;ve been stuck on the RADIUS authentication. Problem is: There is not so much documentation about it and the community forum has its registration for new users currently disabled.
 I found this snippet of code in the nedi.conf file:
 # Authentication for GUI users can be set to: # local, sso, pam, radius, ldap or none # Append -pass to specify a password and optional CLI port for device access in Devices-Write (The GUI-username is used, if the User field is left empty) # Add 2nd argument with ldap or radius to assign groups to users which don&#x27;t exist within NeDi (disabled if empty, minimal access with &quot;usr,&quot;) # Be aware that ldap or radius may have problems with passwords containing language specific special characters #guiauth ldap usr,net,dsk,mon,oth, ;guiauth local # Override the Login and Logout URLs (e.g. for your SSO setup) # The defaults will be used if commented # Login URL Logout URL ;authurls User-Profile.php index.php # Set Radiusserver(s) parameters, if selected above # host port secret timeout retries ;radserver localhost 1812 testing123 2 1 
 It looks pretty straight forward but when I setup the &quot;guiauth&quot; variable to &quot;radius&quot; and configure the &quot;host&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; variable and try to connect to the GUI with one of my test users, I get an error 500 from the server saying that it can&#x27;t handle the request.
 I&#x27;ve looked into my RADIUS server&#x27;s logs (Cisco ISE) and I don&#x27;t even see the request hitting the server.
 Am I missing something ? Also, does anyone know how to hash the secret so it doesn&#x27;t appear in full text in the nedi.conf file ?
 Cheers to anyone that can help me!

I understand I if I enforce password changes for, lets say 60 days and notify at 14 then they (should) know 14 days out. But how can we check how much time is left for any given account at any time?

 I have recently been deploying some new Juniper route reflectors in order to replace some aging Cisco ones in our network. Our route reflector clients are a mixture of various Cisco and Juniper routers which provide both L2 and L3 VPN services.
 When migrating some of the Cisco clients I have come across an issue where the Juniper route reflectors were not reflecting VPLS autodiscover prefixes to the Cisco clients. On further investigation we found that the route reflectors were not advertising the VPLS AD prefixes as the Cisco devices were never sending a RT-constraint NLRI for configured VFIs using BGP autodisover but LDP signalling. We have managed to prove that this was the issue as when we configur…</span>

Because the application is live, I don&#x27;t close streams, they remain open (as they do in websockets). Does QUIC have any protection against replay attacks for such open streams?

 So we want to encrypt radius and tacacs password stored on the switches using aes encryption using some kind of &quot;password encryption aes&quot; or &quot;encrypt type 6&quot; command. 
 Is this doable ,if yes how do we do it?
 Thank you for your help.

                              <span>Hello networking community,
 I&#x27;m in the process of considering Fortinet SD-WAN for around 1300 sites in the UK and I would greatly appreciate any feedback from those who have experience with it. 
 I&#x27;m interested in knowing your overall satisfaction with Fortinet SD-WAN. What are the things you like about it? Are there any areas that could be improved?
 Looking back on your past experiences, is there anything you would do differently if given the chance?
 In addition, I&#x27;m curious to know the architecture you have implemented (FGCP/FGSP) on both Branch and Hub sites, as well as whether you have implemented Internet Breakout and how security was handled ?
 I look forward to your insights, which I&#x27;m sure will be invaluable not just to me, but also to others in the networking community. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!

                              <span>Anyone had any luck trying to use Clearpass for returning DPSKs to a Ruckus controller?
 It&#x27;s one of those things that would be relatively easy on a more open platform, but looks impossible on a locked-down appliance like Clearpass.
 Clearpass certainly supports the MAC auth that the Ruckus uses in External DPSK mode. And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.
 As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let&#x27;s assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.
 Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.

                              <span>We have some of those routers in our network. They have been some of the most finicky routers yet. Out of the blue they can go from working to not recognizing 10g uplinks. No number of reboots, new sfps, load sharing can get them working again. 
 Even Good ole Cisco with gold support is like &quot;lol just buy new routers&quot;.

                              <span>I am trying to find information on how many serial terminations are allowed along a single ethernet connection. For example, for structured cabling that might &quot;want&quot; wall-mount patch panels on either end of pieces of conduit, combined with in-rack patch panels. I would assume each such connection will degrade signaling integrity and also PoE efficiency.
 Any pointers for me? Are there standards-based limits?

                              <span>Hi, 
 Was hoping someone may know this. I am busy writing some scripts in Python, one in particular is to SNMP into a switch and basically gather ARP tables as I need to Mac Address and IP Address to run NMAP scans. 
 I did a SNMP walk of a switch just to see the information it has. I came across fields that I want to extract which is easy. So my question is:
 1) I cannot seem to find how to corrolate the port number to the mac address/IP address of the device. I was hoping someone may know? I tried doing Ctrl + F on ifIndex, IP, Mac Address and VLAN but couldn&#x27;t find the corrolation.
 2) Which OID should I use if I run this across chassis based switches aswell? Which will be most reliable to use? - ipNetToMediaIfIndex, ipNetToMediaPhysAddress, ipNetToMediaNetAddress or ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress?
 SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 &#x3D; STRING: DUMMY-SWITCH-NAME
 IF-MIB::ifName.1001 &#x3D; STRING: 1/1/1
 IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaIfIndex.13600006.10.147.95.232 &#x3D; INTEGER: 13600006
 IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaPhysAddress.13600006.10.147.95.232 &#x3D; STRING: a2:ca:28:2b:d
 IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaNetAddress.13600006.10.147.95.232 &#x3D; IpAddress: 10.147.95.232
 IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress.13600006.ipv4.&quot;10.147.95.232&quot; &#x3D; STRING: a2:ca:28:2b:d
 IF-MIB::ifIndex.1001 &#x3D; INTEGER: 1001
 IF-MIB::ifDescr.13600006 &#x3D; STRING: VLAN-RANDOM
 IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.1001 &#x3D; INTEGER: up(1)
 IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.1001 &#x3D; INTEGER: up(1)
 IF-MIB::ifDescr.1001 &#x3D; STRING: Alcatel-Lucent OS6860 GNI 1/1/1 
 You may look above and say &quot;Well who uses Alcatel Lucent&quot;, I say &quot;Dont worry, I ask myself the same question every day&quot;.
 Also mac address above is random, so dont worry! I aim to run this across core switches or who knows, I could even run this across the odd 400 switches we have depending. 
 Hope it makes sense. Many thanks.

                              <span>We recently setup a new network and firewall configuration and one of the major changes we made was to restrict outgoing traffic to specific ports. Tonight I noticed a number of firewall entries that I have not noticed before and I was wondering if the basic logging would give any indication as to what might be happening here. The firewall itself is a cisco asa 5506, I will be looking at ways to capture the traffic in these conditions, but thought I would ask here as well. 
 The server in question does have an incoming ACL on port 443, it also has an outgoing ACL on port 443. 
 The log entry is this; 
 Feb 21 22:59:06 GMT/BST: %ASA-session-3-106100: access-list RS-DMZ_access_in denied tcp RS-DMZ/192.168.51.11(443) -&gt; outside/x.x.x.x(57492) hit-cnt 1 first hit [0xdc286a6b, 0x00000000]
 ​
 The interesting thing to me is that is originating from port 443 and going to a random port externally. 
 Could this be some kind of http keepalive or poll? 
 We have had no reports from the operations team as to things not working, so I can only guess the impact of the block is nothing worth worrying about.

                              <span>I am trying to migrate an ASA-5506X from FMC to FDM for device management. After reading documentation and cisco community articles, this process seems easy and requires no downtime, reboot, or configuration loss.
 Documentation shows that the following lines need to be entered on the box :
 **entered after device has been removed from FMC**
 # configure manager delete
 # configure manager local
 This process seems very straightforward; however, this firewall is remote to me, so I wanted to see if anyone has had the same experience running the same migration before I migrate this device myself.Thanks again.

                              <span>Network engineer here. I’m responsible for deploying CPE devices and configuring our infrastructure (ISP) for various commercial network services. 
 After about six years in this job I’ve noticed two common issues with any given deployment:
  
Contractors that splice the fiber almost always do it wrong and the CPE is unreachable as a result.
 The Local system lost parts and I have to send replacements
  
This is the only engineering job I’ve had so I’m trying to get some idea how common this is across the industry. It’s the very definition of insanity. Any other engineers find this to be true?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the answer to Nexus VPC peer-gateway without HSRP behavior for some time on the internet now to no avail. 
 VPC peer-gateway installs the other switch&#x27;s mac in the mac table as GATEWAY so there wont be any unnecessary forwarding on the Peer-Link but in all documents it is paired with FHRP. What happens if I set the same IP address (Gateway for downstream server/router) under the SVI on both switches and enable Peer-Gateway without configuring FHRP? Just a duplicate IP address and Peer-Gateway.
 ​
 This is a long story, I&#x27;m not a fan of this since you can run HSRP on a private IP range and set a single IP from a public range as gateway for clients under the HSRP virtual IP but for some unknown reason my boss is pushing for the first option and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going to break under such circumstances.
 ​
 Any input is appreciated I&#x27;m hoping to convince the boss to go for the sane method but need some better understanding first and demonstrate what negative effects it can have. Maybe it&#x27;s going to work flawlessly and I just don&#x27;t know about it but he is not giving me any reference to back up this solution.

 I have been facing issues while deplpying forescout NAC Solution. As per requirement, we need to install secure connector on endpoints in .msi format so that it can be pushed through windows tool and get installed on endpoints, but the issue we are facing that after entering below url:
 Https://em ip/sc-installer
 Screen prompts to the application error and doesnt let me download .msi format file (.exe file format is downloadable and page is accessible)(https://appliance/sc). As per forescout documentation have checked below points and applied but status is still the same.
 1) web feature i.e sec connector tool is enabled on all EM and other appliances ip addresses. 2) feature also checked in disable web portals, http redirection is unchecked.
 Kindly help in this regard, as deadlines are near.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey all
 I&#x27;m in the process of setting up the Firewall as the place where routing happens so I can do inter-VLAN inspection. See previous post. I have a Palo alto 450 connected to a Cisco 9200.
 Historically our core has been connected to a firewall via a Layer 3 connection with an IP address. 172.16.0.1(firewall) &gt; 172.16.0.2 (Core). There are static routes on both devices that list those IPs as the next hops. 
 I&#x27;m trying to get the VLAN information and routing up to the firewall, and in order to do that I need to make a trunk connection rather than an access connection. But trunk connections don&#x27;t have layer 3 IP addresses, so if I convert my access connection to trunk, I&#x27;ll lose my IP addresses. But then my static route won&#x27;t know where to go. 
 I&#x27;m sorry, I feel like I&#x27;m missing something very obvious here. How do I do inter-vlan routing on a firewall and still have the core switch know how to get traffic from the access switches up to the firewall?

                              <span>Hopefully an easy question but finding any actual advice/guidance has been sparse on Google.
 We have switches that have uncovered empty SFP slots (I know, bad, bad, inherited environment) that have been running for several years. I now need to install an SFP module into one of said switches but I am unsure of the safest way to ensure the port is clean. The problem is the switch cannot be turned off, way too important unfortunately. My worry is possible shorts while disturbing any dust during cleaning.
 Initial thought is to use canned air in the slot. Are there any dangers that could arise from using canned air in the slot? Please let me know what you recommend.
 ​
 P.S. We are looking into dust caps for the ports.

                              <span>This is more of an (in)sanity check. I used to be a &quot;network technician&quot; for a K12 school, did a lot deployment of switches, UPS, and APs campus-wide. I&#x27;ve taken CCNA level courses, and have a decent understanding of basic network theory. Now, I work in higher-ed and I&#x27;ve been here 3 years in a role that focuses more on server deployment and maintenance, vSphere management, and application deployment, NOT in networking. 
 The first week I started (January 2020) I noticed how lackluster and unpredictable the Wi-Fi was on my phone. We have 4 SSIDs, a hidden one, a guest one, a staff one, and a student one. Guest is open, and the hidden SSID is for MDM deployed devices (WPA2-PSK). Staff/Student is 802.1x with user login. They all land on the same VLAN... You heard me right, they all go to the…</span>

                              <span>I work in a small-mid business as the IT technician and we outsource some of the upgrades which we have done. One of which is coming up due no longer being able to get support or licences for the Watchguard M200.
 We are having to look at upgrading possibly part of this setup or all of it as part of a refresh due to this and preventative in case of failure of the hardware since its over 6 years old. (before my time). We have no choice but to upgrade the Watchguard m200 since the licensing which we just renewed Jan 2023 (paid for one year) but only can get it till end of June this year.
 We have been quoted by the company which we outsource some of this the Meraki kit from cisco. 
 The MX105 to replace the router/firewall which is currently a Watchguard M200.
 MS120-48FP in place of the two HPE switches and 
 MR44 to replace the ubiquity wifi access points.
 ​
 However from the research I have done, it feels quite overkill. We have about 40-50 employees in the office and 100 others working on phones remotely (which don&#x27;t need to really connect to the office network). Only users which need to VPN access to the office network is about 10-20 users.
 ​
 I&#x27;m Torn between the two options (open to other options), 
  
Replace only the Watchguard M200 with the latest equivalent and upgrade the controller for the AP&#x27;s to a more reliable one. 
 Follow the recommendation but possibly with a MX75 instead of a MX105.
  
One thing that does confuse me is whether some of the security features are tied to licences (advanced security, enterprise or SD-WAN) or to the devices. Features such as content filtering and web search filtering and intrusion protection. 
 What they quoted us came to about £27,000 for kit and licences for 3 years. I&#x27;m quite new to this could use some advice

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I am developing a product for multiple clients, and that product is going to be running on the cloud as a SaaS. The product focuses on analysing the client&#x27;s private security cameras, so the idea is that the client simply puts the IP of the camera and my product starts picking up the feed. In these situations most of clients have their cameras in a private network and so just by having the IP won&#x27;t do any good. What would the simplest way for the client to allow my product to have access to that private network so it can access the camera feed ? 
 Thanks in advance ?

                              <span>Hey hey, Does anyone have experience with using external 4G/5G antennas with their routers? I have a use case where a mobile router needs to be placed in a basement, approx. 10-15m away from a place with sufficient mobile signal. Is there an antenna with such cable length that would work? 
 Router/antenna recommendations appreciated.
 I was also thinking about getting a rigid poe-powered 4G router (btw, 5G is not a must) and placing it where the signal is available. The place is a ventilation pipe, so withstanding weather of any season is necessary. Then, I&#x27;d only have a PoE switch and an AP in the aforementioned basement.
 I&#x27;m in Europe, btw.
 Asking for a friend.

                              <span>So, in my company every few days or even hours, when someone is connected to the network, sometimes they get &quot;No Internet&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter on wifi or lan, it doesn&#x27;t ping any hostname, doesn&#x27;t ping any IP, doesn&#x27;t open any local website, it only works after locking pc &amp; unlock it again, it seems like domain issue? what is your suggestion?

 I&#x27;m not very familiar with the setup. Anyone has encountered this before? The account used for configuring has network-admin role assigned, so should have privilege.

                              <span>I have been checking out the DPVS project as of recently and some of the layer 4 features seem like they could do quite well for implementing a stateful firewall I could control from a database I can interface with. I have a few machines that each have IPs on my subnet for each application I&#x27;m running and a distribution layer switch. 
 I want to use Bird for announcing my ASN and advertising my unicast subnet (potentially AnyTun package might be used for applications to have lower latency to Europe in the future) and if possible manage to implement /arouteserver for peering with cloud providers which I access frequently to lower IP transit costs. 
 Since I have no upstream to filter traffic I would be verifying on my own and forwarding to my switch the traffic and letting it manage IPs to destinations to leverage its switching capacity for when my machines will intermingle with each others&#x27; applications instead of using up the capacity on my Linux entry and BGP machine. 
 I apologize for my limited networking knowledge when it comes to design and architecture, but I have the feeling that a software based router would be the best in this scenario, if you guys have any advice for DPDK based open source projects I could leverage or implementing a firewall that could handle reasonable PPS with efficiency on a 2x40Gb/s NIC and 7950x consumer high IPC processor I would be grateful and massively appreciative.

 I&#x27;ve been working for a company for a few years now and as of the beginning of the year, half my team was cut due to economic hardening, or whatever it may be. 
 Long story short, I&#x27;m now the primary contact for the security team, and also a sys admin, when I was just technical support before. The burnout is coming, I can feel it but I want to try and get ahead of it.
 What are some tips and tricks you&#x27;ve found that help with managing your workload/time in the midst of seemingly endless requests?

 For example today I was running DISM.exe on a troublesome computer it was stuck at 13.5% for 2-3 minutes. Just for the heck of it I hit enter key within the terminal and immediately it goes to 14% and continues on normally. 
 Maybe it is just a coincidence but I swear this has happen to me multiple times. 
 I do know the ping -t command can get stuck so hitting enter &quot;wakes&quot; it backup.

I can take the test for pretty cheap due to a connection with my college (I can take it for $149)
 I daily drive Linux and would like to learn more
 One day I think I&#x27;d like to be a Linux System Admin
 I think it would look good on my resume
 It would renew some of my lower levels cert automatically
  
Just curious on /r/sysadmin thoughts

                              <span>I work in education (high school), and I am planning to pitch a somewhat more stern approach to certain IT practices to senior management soon; in particular, I would like everyone to start using a password manager that is freely provided on every school device, to eliminate things like constant password forgetting for our various services, passwords written on post-its stuck on monitors, etc.
 I am wondering what kinds of sanctions, if any, your companies apply to &#x27;offenders&#x27;, especially serial ones, who do not follow company policy even after training has been given.
 For example, if employees have agreed as part of an AUP to use the password manager to store their passwords, but you still catch post-its lying around or they still come to you with &quot;I forgot my password&quot;, and when you challenge it you get &quot;oh no I am not using that password manager thing&quot;... are there any kinds of sanctions? Disciplinary mentions on their file? Formal warnings? A stern talking to by someone senior?
 I&#x27;d just like to see what&#x27;s out there, to pitch the right ideas to my senior team.

 I am definitely on the younger side of this sysadmin thing, in my mid 20s. I do not have as much experience as some of you folks but am definitely qualified for the roles I&#x27;ve been interviewed for and while I&#x27;m not the best interviewee in the world, I feel I&#x27;m decent enough.
 I&#x27;m just starting my third tech/sysadmin role. I&#x27;ve probably had 6 or 7 interviews that have gotten to or near the final stage in this field between all of these roles. For every role I have ended up getting, my direct manager has been quite young for someone in their position, somewhere in their 20s for all of them. These aren&#x27;t even interviews that I feel I&#x27;ve done particularly well in. In fact, I feel some of them were quite bad, worse than ones I have failed.
 However, I notice the opposite with deciders who are a generation or two older than me. Many of them more than double my age. In these interviews, I have come out feeling like I nailed every question and left no room for questioning, but still find out they have chosen the other candidate or did not choose me for hire. From my personal experiences it just seems so blatant and honestly the largest factor in the interview process. Has anyone else experienced this as an interviewee or interviewer, or have I just had some unlucky experiences?

                              <span>Over the years I&#x27;ve had to deal with a lot of &quot;I got married and changed my last name&quot; requests, and those usually don&#x27;t get much friction if for example you push the update and it still shows the wrong last name in some places for a while.
 But the situation I&#x27;m up against is we have a trans woman who doesn&#x27;t want to see her dead name anymore. I&#x27;m trying to accomplish this for her, but I&#x27;m up against a few factors that are making it a little irritating to deal with.
 So for example, cached exchange mode. Even after telling it to download the offline address book again, the name doesn&#x27;t properly update. And Exchange and Teams admin centers, new name shows up when referencing the online GAL, but client-side the old name and new name often show up at the same time depending on which viewport you&#x27;re opening.
 Am I gonna have to nuke offline OABs and force cache resets?
 And this does seem like a lot of unnecessary effort, but it is a very important and personal issue to her and I&#x27;d like to accommodate her wishes.

From time to time, we publish IT newsletter with some basic knowledge, but we doubt how many people (if any) would actually read and learn. Because of that, we are considering making an internal site with IT FAQ (maybe with SharePoint?) that people can refer to when they have common issues. Just want to check with you guys. Did you ever try this approach, and did it work for you?

                              <span>We use Chrome Enterprise across the board as our default browser and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it and with the GPO controls you can apply to it so far. But I recently read that Chrome is enabling their &quot;memory saver&quot; feature by default. 
 Memory saver discards the content of your background tabs after a &quot;certain amount of time&quot; then reloads the tab when you switch back. This has some potential to cause problems in our environment where people use tabs to go back and forth between sites for data lookup/entry and have text entered but not saved.
 There are ways to manually disable it from the UI, but I have yet to find a GPO rule that will turn it off. I downloaded the newest ADMX templates and skimmed them, but didn&#x27;t see it listed. 
 Does anyone know a good way to disable this across the board without relying on user interaction?

                              <span>First of all, pardon me for my awful english.
 Hello everyone, a few months back i was promoted to IT Manager (i started as HelpDesk L1 and then as an IT Analyst; also i work in a hotel).
 The thing is that i really feel like i don&#x27;t belong yet to this position, since i don&#x27;t know much about Networking (I know how to configure Switches, Firewalls, Routers, AP but just the basics), Azure or AD (i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant but i love to use Microsoft Power Automate).
 So any advice or tip you can give me it would be great!
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: Thank you again all of you for your responses, i&#x27;m thinking that is not what i really want, i think i would like to be like a Sys Admin or Sys Manager)

                              <span>Looks like this is rolling out to their servers currently, full changelog here:
 https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3k-release-notes.html#esxi-7-0u3k-21313628-standard-resolved
 Direct links for anyone who needs them can be found here:
 https://esxi-patches.v-front.de/ESXi-7.0.0.html
 Obviously this only fixes ESXi 7, 8.0 isn&#x27;t affected and 6.7 is now out of support so if you are still on that you will need to disable secure boot as the only workaround.

                              <span>Helping out at work (small business) and they are currently out of ports on their unmanaged switch so I was thinking of recommending one 48 port and keeping the 24 as a backup but not sure if simply adding another 24 is the way to go for redundancy. 
 They also have a few POE devices (Unifi AP and cameras) and could benefit from a POE switch.
 Thanks in advance.
 ——————
 Edit: You’re guys are awesome. Thank you so much for all the awesome suggestions. He likes the 48 Unifi POE with the 24 port as a backup. Will be configuring a VLAN for Guest Wi-Fi and one for the security cameras.

                              <span>Post upgrade from windows server 2012 to 2019.. notice iis hosted site does not connect when there is a server restart .
 It works after removing site ip from iplisten list and adding it back. Not sure why it stops after a restart. any specific services need to be running ? I checked for iis admin service and .net tcp listener service are in running state. 
 When this issue happen I look for site ip given in IIS manager under site bindings of that url that is not working and I run below commands
 Netsh http delete iplisten ip address 
 And 
 Netsh http add iplisten ip address 
 In 2 or 3 minutes site will be up. But not sure what is causing it not to work after restart. 
 Above steps need to be done repeatedly whenever there is a server restart and we are getting many tickets especially due to this issue.
 Kindly let me know if any links or sources to correct this issue. I am newbie to managing servers and still in learning phase. Appreciate any inputs on this

 I have setup our AzureAD to federate using our third party idP the problem I’m having is that we have a system that needs to use SMTP using smtp.office365.com to send alerts and it is not working. I’m thinking is because users get redirected to our third party idP. I did not find a way to create app passwords in Microsoft 365 even after following Microsoft instructions. Am I SOL on this?

 Just curious if there is somewhere out Bitlocker recovery keys would be stored automatically or if I just need to reimage them.
 We are in the process of switching to a Hybrid AAD environment, deploying via AutoPilot, and the rest of the smorgasbord of activities that come with it in our org. We recently purchased a couple hundred Dell laptops to use as our current models to deploy to users and they are kept at our VAR’s warehouse but we found that they are all touchscreen, which breaks one of our internal apps because it changes the formatting of the entire web app if it detects a touchscreen device and requires the use of the touchscreen to scroll around (or to click and drag with the mouse like you would a finger.)
 Rather than the app team disable this because we do not use …</span>

                              <span>So a lot of ink has been spilled on how 1Password&#x27;s secret key and user password combination makes it less vulnerable than, say, LastPass and Bitwarden to having your a copy of your vault stolen and decrypted by an attacker. My understanding, then, is that basically the only way to open a 1Password encrypted vault is to be on a device that has already been authorized and have your user password. 
 So what&#x27;s to stop an attacker from using a keylogger to get your user password, and then gaining remote control of your device and just logging into it? Is this just a &quot;secure your workstation better, dummy&quot; kinds of situations?

                              <span>Tl:dr: company went from everything breaking every day to everything working all of the time, and my anxiety has me worrying the company may feel im no longer needed because of it. Even though im still always doing things.
 I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?
 I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was &quot;what are we fixing today&quot;. And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. 
 Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking &quot;what is going to break today&quot;, and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.
 I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got a problem with my dc here. I&#x27;m in the process of migrating a ton of VMs to another esxi host that is configured identically to the one it was on before.
 One of these VMs is a domain controller for my little experiments here. All machines get their IP config from a dhcp like this: host { hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa; fixed-address dc.test }
 this works fine but now after migration I can&#x27;t reach anything with the DC and vice versa. I see the DC asking for ip-configs on the dhcp-server and it does configure itself with the info obtained, but it stays unreachable. 
 tried this windows tool to troubleshoot it lol, it say the problem is that the gateway is unreachable (no shit sherlock) so as I think everything is configured correctly and should just work like with all the linux VMs i moved, i thought I&#x27;d ask here.
 Any ideas whats wrong?

 having issues accessing a File share on a Windows 11 Azure AD Joined machine from a Local AD Machine (VM) tried every combination of username or domain/username doesn&#x27;t work. has anyone had an experience with this? the VM can happily see the AAD machine on the network (Ping Tracert etc) we are looking at the feasibility of upgrading to pure AAD but will be in steps.

 Usually when nobody knows what to do or my collegues are just not suicidal enough to take on the task I&#x27;m the only one who grabs that ticket, so I started looking at it and trying to find a way. ( I have a bit of a Problem I know. It is dumb, it is not my job to tank vague and undefined client requests etc etc I don&#x27;t really want to get into the socio-philosophic issues behind why this shouldn&#x27;t be happening in the firs…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 Looking for advice on delegating device management within an MDM world.
 Context: 
 We (Company A) look after 20k devices using the standard industry tools of SCCM/Intune. We have recently moved to Defender and are very much a Microsoft shop with A/E5 licenses. We have a spin-off company (Company B) that has its own local IT team and managed about 300 devices. Company B get some services from us, such as the O365 licenses (so they user our @companyname.com email address), they previously got AV from us (see notes below) and they do their own wipe and load using their own SCCM instances that is no way connected to ours&#x27;s. Overall, Company B doesn&#x27;t want company a touching, managing their devices - I will not be getting into the politics of this. 
 Other notes: 
 Our devices get put…</span>

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins. Short question. Is there are way to get the Service-Tag from the S/N Number? A WMI-query pulls the service-tag (7digit number) for our asset management we took the S/N-Number (e.g. CN-0YMYH1-74261-443-1K8S). Now I have to bring those 2 numbers together and ofc don’t want to get them physically:D

                              <span>21, been at my place for just over 2 years now, and overall I love my job. However, I constantly feel like I’m inadequate in terms of my ability. I don’t know enough networking, or enough about some systems or technologies, such as VMware etc… I’m studying for my Network+ at the moment. I’ve just been feeling like I’m slacking at work even though I like to think that I work hard everyday. 
 Been hitting me hard lately and putting myself down I guess but boss told me earlier that I can expect a 2k pay rise in the next coming months which all other directors happily and easily agreed to which kind of put it into perspective that I’m probably not doing that bad at all. 
 If this is imposter syndrome then it’s a horrible feeling.

                              <span>Previously, our staff users have had a home drive &quot;U:&quot; on one of our file servers. We&#x27;re currently in the process of migrating these over to OneDrive for Business, but for some staff we&#x27;re finding that after we&#x27;ve migrated them, they are sometimes not seeing all their other network drives in File Explorer on Windows 10.
 We currently map network drives using logon scripts - Group Policy Preferences would not be practical as different users need different combinations of network drives - these scripts are batch files with commands like net use v: \\SERVERNAME\SHARENAME$ /PERSISTENT:NO.
 For the vast majority of users these are working fine but for some reason, intermittently the network drives don&#x27;t show up in File Explorer. We tried re-running the logon script but that said the drives were already mapped. We went to try mapping the drives using the Map Network Drive wizard in File Explorer, and we found that the wizard could actually see the network drives. This led us to discover that restarting File Explorer made the drives visible.
 We tried setting the EnableLinkedConnections registry entry (e.g. as per this ServerFault post) but this did not help.
 We tried enabling NETLOGON debug logging on computers where the incidents were reported, but the NETLOGON debug log didn&#x27;t show any obvious causes.
 Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how we can resolve it? Other than having our users restart File Explorer every time their drives go missing?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Solo IT officer for a medium sized org here. I need some advice on how to handle guest users in our organisation&#x27;s AzureAD/InTune environment.
 I&#x27;m quite concerned about the security implications of how it is setup currently.
 Without getting into too much detail our organisation has clients that walk in off the street and use our computer lab to work on relatively confidential documents.
 Before my time our we had setup several generic user accounts for non employees to use e.g. guestuser1, guestuser2, etc.. for the guest users which is obviously is going to leave behind traces of the files and logins stored within the user profile from the previous session which is not ideal. So I need to come up with a better solution.
 Relying on staff to send new user requests for each new guest and having me to create them and assign them office licenses is just going to be way too cumbersome.
 I need something that will allow guests to login to specific PCs with just access to the web and ms office with minimal intervention from IT.
 Wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat and what they have tried.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking for another job and in the past few interviews, I ran into the best issue out there: lack of knowledge. So I need your help in deciding where should I focus my learning efforts. Here are a few topics that I feel I need to know to make the switch:
  
 Python scripting (for system administration) - I have no experience (apart from scripting in general (PS))
 Terraform - I have no experience (apart from IaC in general, while using Bicep)
 Linux - yeah, no experience here too...
 Docker/K8 - still nope
  
Which one would you choose as the first step? How deep would you go? Would you go all in into Linux, for example, or just learn the basics and go on to the next one?

 I have an M365 user which account keeps getting locked, 2-3 times a day, and can&#x27;t find any informations about it in M365 admin audit log.
 First thought it&#x27;ll be his mobile phone so asked him to remove the M365 account on it, but account still gets locked.
 Any idea where I could find a decent log? With maybe more informations on what device (if that is the case) causes the lockout?
 Thanks !

 I have a windows process which occupy 4GB of RAM, and I need it from 9 to 10 o&#x27;clock, everyday.
 Then after 10:00, I need to manually kill it from Task Manager, to retrieve the 4GB of RAM, which I would use for other software. 
 Is there a way to kill this process at given time, automatically?

                              <span>Hi all,
 My company has finally made the decision to migrate to Office 365/Exchange Online after YEARS of pushing them to undertake the project. We are currently just finishing up some of the prep work on our Exchange such as moving everything over to AD sync, migrating resource rooms etc before we start doing User Mailboxes.
 One of the questions is what&#x27;s the best licensing model? We are looking at getting rid of our Anti-Virus and going with Microsoft Defender which comes standard with M365 E3 and M365 E5. My manager has decided to pitch the idea of going with a mixture of Business Standard and Premium with adding on Exchange Online Plan 2 (For some employees), InTune and Microsoft Defender license ON TOP of the business standard and premium.
 Are there any benefits that the M365 E3/E5 provide over the Business Standard and Premium if we add those extra licenses on top or would it just be smarter to go with the M365 E3 and E5?
 The manager has pitched massive cost savings but doesn&#x27;t really make sense to go with Business Standard/Premium with the add on licenses opposed to just forking out the extra money for M365 E3 and E5?

                              <span>Hey there! 
 I&#x27;ve got an Supermicro Server at hands, it was set up around 2016, and it has 4 Hitachi Ultrastar SAS drives installed, since they&#x27;ve not been replaced yet I think they&#x27;re also from 2016, so about 8 years now.
 We want to use that server as backup storage now, but I&#x27;m not sure about the old disks. 
 My gut feeling is to replace them, even if it will cost some money, but I bet they&#x27;re going to fail soon and I don&#x27;t want to buy old rusty rotating disks again and replace them one by one.
 Maybe someone has some experience here and / or advice? 
 Thanks in Advance!

 I&#x27;m a sysadmin at a public school with around 800 students (from 6 to 15 year olds) and 100 teachers.
 Not a single day goes by without at least 2-3 (but often more) students and/or teachers popping by my office because they forgot their password and need help to figure it out / reset it.
 I&#x27;m just wondering if this is normal in the day and age of 2023? Personally, I never forget my passwords and I&#x27;m quite baffled that, at least the teachers (20+ years old) forget their passwords this often.
 The younger kids may be excused in this case, but grown up people not being able to handle their passwords just strikes me as odd.

                              <span>Even your backups should have backups!
 Long story short - My UnRaid VM directory yeeted itself out of existence, took my backups on a hot date and just said F it.
 I went to make some changes on a VM (directly upgrading to Windows 2019 std) and had to reboot in order to accept the changes. The VM went missing - hmm that&#x27;s odd - No problem! I&#x27;ll just recover it from an older backup. I have a schedule of 30 days to hold backups, and they&#x27;re usually overwritten when they reach 15 backups, older ones are deleted afterward.
 Those were deleted too.
 No logs.
 No errors.
 No error logs.
 No system logs.
 No alerts telling me about the missing logs.
 Nothing.
 Just an empty folder from my ~/domains/ - and no VM&#x27;s in sight. I rebuilt the VM from scratch, and I&#x27;m on my merry way now. Not sure what happened - the Vendor is hopefully researching into it as it&#x27;s some abnormal behavior

                              <span>In the 4 IT jobs I&#x27;ve had (Im a very technical IT middle manager), 3/4 Heads/Directors/CIOs of IT have had absolutely no technical ability whatsoever, they dont even know what Azure or Active Directory is. This applies to both the dev/sysadmin sides of IT.
 I&#x27;ve only had 1 IT head who was technical and had great soft skills, he we an amazing boss, we could discuss technical details at length, and he knew how to carry himself and represent us in C level meetings, he was amazing. 
 Why is it that only IT has this issue? Our CFO knows all about the ins and outs of budgets/cashflow and is very knowledge in his field. Our Head of HR knows all about policies etc. Our C level exec of law is VERY knowledge in law.
 Its not just past jobs either, you wouldnt hire a head of medical surgery that had no idea how to perform any surgery. You wouldnt hire head chef who couldnt cook. Imagine hiring a head of Marketing or Sales who had little to no idea about marketing or sales.
 I&#x27;m not saying you need to be hyper technical about IT to be a CIO, but you at least have to be good at it in some capacity in ADDITION to have good soft, management and leadership skills (just like any other C level position). I&#x27;m not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. 
 Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT? So they just hire non technical people to run IT departments because thats all their is in the talent pool?

                              <span>Company has two domain controllers, a few servers, one major file server. I’ve been with company for a week, and they’re dropping their third party tech support next month; license for backup software just expired I believe (backblaze). Everything is on Microsoft. 
 I need to set up a backup and restore process. Ideally free or low cost, and low maintenance as I will be only one doing anything tech related. What options do you guys suggest I look into?
 Thanks in advance for the suggestions

 If it&#x27;s possible to do assign two profiles to the same device, what happens if there are conflicting restrictions / settings? How about when you delete one of them?

 Some years ago I was brought into a development company(aka all mac computers) The company was run by a guy that couldn&#x27;t keep it in his pants, and often made business decisions based on &quot;getting some&quot;. This included his now x girlfriends pole dancing studio attached to their work.
 My valuation of the companies security and systems was abismal, they didn&#x27;t have a server room, cabling was all garbage, firewalls were all swiss cheesed, completely flat network. And to make matters worse the wireless was open from the studio and gave access to the entire company; my valuation was all written and a proposal was put forward to do a few things: Fix the wireing and make an act…</span>

                              <span>Crossposting this here as it probably impacts a lot of the people in this sub.
 My resume isn&#x27;t posted on any of the online sites in the last few years. Still I get spammed daily with at least a dozen emails from 3rd party recruiters offering me this &quot;great&quot; position in a place nowhere near where I live that is not relevant at all to what I do now. I tried unsubscribing but this has zero effect. Clicking the spam button when i receive them also seems to have little effect. I finally wrote a Google Apps Script to punt them right to spam and send them a canned response.
 If any of you are in the same boat, you&#x27;re welcome to use my script. Feel free to modify the script to point to your own canned response or create your own list of offending domains. If you have some US based domains I&#x27;m missing, message me and I&#x27;ll get them added.

When you tell it&#x27;s not allowed they look weird at you and say that it works fine at their homes... I get so frustrated about this because they never care and keep doing this...
 Have you experienced this and how do you respond?

 You know, I used to be up on the Windows server releases. Used to, because I can&#x27;t remember the last time I deployed an app on Windows. Everything is RHEL now. We even deploy MS SQL Server on Linux these days.
 Has anyone gone all Mac or all Linux on the desktop?

                              <span>Good morning everyone,
 I work at a small (&lt;15 employees) controls engineering firm. I was originally hired to design SCADA HMI screens and the database backends that collected data. As such as I was really familiar with python (jython 2.5./2.7) which is the scripting language of our SCADA software of choice and SQL. These two topics I am very comfortable with and would rate myself as above-average or better at.
 As time has gone on I have been exposed to certain network concepts just for deployment of our SCADA systems - IP addressing, firewalls, subnets, and working with Active Directories but just as a means of getting a user source for our SCADA projects, however it was all very surface level, and I only ever learned &quot;just enough&quot; to get things working.
 Now this is where the issue com…</span>

                              <span>Just putting a reminder out there that we are only human and we do make mistakes.
 After nearly 20 years of doing this, and recently starting a new role at a new company, I made a rookie mistake by misreading/interpreting a report, and thus making a change that essentially affected nearly 3,000 users in a negative way. I&#x27;m probably beating myself up more than I think my superiors are, or will. Regardless, I feel like crap about it, feel like a failure, and need to get out of my own head to move forward.
 This is going to be a long week.
 Edit: Wow, this blew up more than I expected it to. No possible way I can respond to everyone, so I just wanted to say... Thanks! As per usual, you guys are awesome! Good news is since I no longer work in a toxic work environment, I bounced back way quicker than I ever expected to. Was back on track (physically, emotionally, and mentally) pretty much by lunchtime. Issue was resolved and just trucking forward on the next item!

                              <span>So my company attempted to put roaming profiles in place for the obvious benefits they bring, but with the many issues we ran into - specifically with Outlook crashing or not connecting to the exchange server - we got rid of roaming profiles. 
 With that being said, I wanted to ask anyone who has experience with using Microsoft 365 accounts to sign into Windows, does it work well? It seems like it would give the same benefits that a roaming profile would, but I don&#x27;t have enough experience with it to start rolling it out confidently. Any issues that you ran into when using the Microsoft 365 account over a domain account? Any benefits that stood out after the fact? Any advice would be appreciated!

                              <span>I have been working on a project for a hotel for the better part of a year, first, half was remote, and the other half required me to be in sand and sun (currently in that phase for 4 more months). I set up 2 fairly large VMs for the Hotel Ops (1TB) and FnB Ops (500GB) as they process a fair bit of data into their databases. All was good till today, both were playing nice, and now I am playing the largest game of Russian roulette with my largest DB, picking random places to break down, never the same DB error twice right now which makes it impossible to track down, I guess there goes my sleep for this week, maybe I&#x27;ll get some sleep when September comes.

                              <span>I feel like I&#x27;m stuck, and I&#x27;m sorry if this sounds like a rant.
 I&#x27;ve been working Desktop Support for about 4 years now and I&#x27;m slowly being allowed more responsibilities at my current company, such as creating new domain accounts and mailboxes and such. I just feel like I&#x27;ll never be on the level of the Sys Admin I work under. When I hear the things they speak about I feel so far behind. I know keeping up to date with exams and new technologies help, but there&#x27;s so much and I feel like I&#x27;ll burst. 
 How did you do it?

 Google hasn&#x27;t been much help unless I&#x27;m looking for the wrong thing. The server does have DUO installed and that is the first article referenced in search, but it says &quot;logon token&quot; not &quot;logon handle&quot;, so not sure if that is a red hearing. 
 It&#x27;s an azure vm and the only this I have access to at the moment is PowerShell and remote registry settings.

 But I want to add a second condition so that the users must also be using authorized computers (part of a second Security Group).
 ​
 I am adding a Machine Groups condition. Whenever I add the second condition users cannot connect any longer.
 Also, if I leave only the Machine Groups condition, it still fails.
 Event viewer shows: &quot;The connection request did not match any configured network policy.&quot;
 ​
 What am I missing here?

I know Proton has this feature as does Mail for iOS but haven&#x27;t seen anything for Office without individually creating a rule within the desktop app and then has limited reach.
 Any input would be appreciated, we&#x27;re using Office 365.

We&#x27;ve been getting a number of emails from personal accounts (gmail, yahoo, hotmail, etc) that are legitimate emails, but they&#x27;re getting filtered out as spam. Management wants me to find a way to keep this from happening while also maintaining a secure environment. I have my concerns - if someone hacks a personal email account that puts the internal recipients at risk of receiving a malicious email, and I&#x27;ve expressed these concerns. They still want me to find a way. 
 If I do move forward with it - is there a overall setting that will allow personal emails to come through? Or do I need to mark each sender as safe, as they come in. Maybe the second approach is safest. What available options do I have? 
 Not looking forward to when the C-group comes to me with their hats in hand and ask me to clean up the mess they&#x27;re asking me to set them up for.

                              <span>Hello altogether,
 I&#x27;d like to tell you something about task on going and I am stuck therefore I am searching for new creative ideas in this topic.
 --
 Background story: We currently use Office 2016 for Blue collar workers where they use shared-devices in order to edit documents, review or save them. Basically what a white collar does just with a M365 E3 License. However Microsoft has announced that Office 2016 and below is ending support for M365 Connectivity services - that&#x27;s where the problem begins.
 Cause: Microsoft announced that Office 2016 will be dismissed with supporting connections to M365-Services like SharePoint and OneDrive. (See: Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn )
 Issue: Solution would be easy to convert everybody to M365 licenses but with almost 7500 BCs it will be way too expensive and cannot justified against management to have such an rise of expenses for licensing.
 Idea: Then I though, hey let&#x27;s enable Viewer Mode for M365 products such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They can view but cannot edit them. If they need to edit documents they can use Word Online and we are going to assign them M365 F3. 
 But there is the next issue which comes with it:
 They cannot access any network shared files where all the local files are located today. Then they need to manually open OneDrive for Business and Word Online everytime and upload the files which they wanna use, save, download and upload it to the network sahre. This won&#x27;t work since conflict risk is pretty high at that amount of users.
 This is not a great solution and I am out of ideas since Microsoft does not provide any further information. Before I create a ticket at Microsoft I&#x27;d like to ask the community whether you have any ideas and if you may experience the same issue in your company?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I just stumbled across something that seems bonkers, maybe you&#x27;ll agree... Our change management team have apparently renamed themselves &quot;CMaaS&quot; - Change Management as a Service. They have a very nice wiki and a lot of written processes, but none of these team members are scalable virtual machine clusters, as far as I&#x27;m aware. Seems sooo weird (at best) to appropriate a defined, if buzzwordy, naming convention. We have a number of weird &quot;aaS&quot; named services which are in now way fitting that model, but now we can apply it to actual people? Way to devalue a concept, right?

 ​
 I need to find out the DSCP value used by the NIC so I can configure the switch interfaces with the relevant info. The NIC is capable of it from what i can tell, and i have configured the QoS settings under advanced properties How do I find this value though?
 NIC in question: 
 HPE Eth 10Gb 2p 537SFP+ Adptr

 Thanks in advance( i am waiting to join hpe so i can post there)

                              <span>Hello, i&#x27;m looking for a capable alternative to systracer so i can track changes that are made on a windows system while an installation.
 The problem is, we can only buy software on account, but systracer is not available with this payment option.
 I am aware of Regshot (advanced), but it can only track registry changes, not filesystem changes. Also compare multiple steps is not really possible.
 ​
 I would be thankful for any recommendations for alternatives (either for file system changes or registry changes, but in best case something that can do both)

 I would like to know what tools or software you use to provision virtual machines, especially in terms of installing necessary software and configurations. I have already tried Ansible for Linux machines which works pretty well. But I need to provision MacOS &amp; Windows as well.
 Thanks in advance for your input.

                              <span>I had no idea where to ask this so apologies in advance if I&#x27;m in the wrong place and if I get the terminology wrong (I almost definitely will)
 Long story short: I have been stalked by someone for years and no matter how many times I make sure my accounts are secured with two factor etc, they always seem to know the most specific information about me. Where I bought dresses I wear in Facebook photos, where I&#x27;ve booked a dinner reservation etc. In addition to this, I keep being subscribed to newsletters I don&#x27;t remember signing up to. A lot of these required confirmation and the confirmation emails are nowhere to be seen in my inbox 
 Other than a public profile picture, all of my socials are incredibly secure and have been for some time due to the ongoing nature of this behaviour. 
 I thought maybe my emails were being forwarded but I&#x27;ve found no evidence of this (I use gmail and have multiple accounts). Tonight I was having another look around my gmail settings and I saw that my IMAP is turned on. I dont understand IMAP or POP but my understanding is, IMAP allows my gmail to be synced with a different mailbox and all changes (including deletions) are synced. 
 I&#x27;m of the belief this is how my stalker is doing it, but as this is an ongoing investigation with the police (there is a court order in place). I want to get any sort of IP information before I just switch it off. 
 Is there a way to do this? Am I understanding all of this correctly? Do any of you have any other ideas? It&#x27;s been going on for so long and most police I talk to are tech illiterate haha.
 Apologies for the long post and thank you in advance

                              <span>I recently updated all of our employees&#x27; user photo in exchange online using the set-userphoto cmdlets. It worked as advertised, however the new photos are not automatically displayed in Sharepoint. From the Microsoft docs I learned that the user has to request (view) his own profile picture once in order to trigger a sync.
 Is there any way to do this from the admin side, without requiring every single user to view his own profile? I know MS says there isn&#x27;t but maybe someone came up with a creative solution.

                              <span>If you have on-prem domain controllers running on vsphere, can you simply clone these to setup a separate and isolated lab? If you put the clones in a separate vlan and IP subnet, they can’t communicate to the prod servers, is that correct?

                              <span>We&#x27;re currently looking at the process necessary for installing the Exchange Cumulative Update on our on-premise Exchange server. We noticed from Microsoft&#x27;s notes that it says:
  
The following types of customized settings will be overwritten when you install an Exchange CU: 
 Any customized Exchange or Internet Information Server (IIS) settings that you made in Exchange XML application configuration files on the Exchange server. For example, web.config files or the EdgeTransport.exe.config file. 
 Customizations to the operating system&#x27;s TLS/Cipher settings. 
 Be sure save this information so you can easily re-apply the settings after the install. After you install the Exchange CU, you need to re-configure these settings.
  
Does anyone have or know of a script that can check for and back up all of the possible customizations that could be overwritten by an Exchange CU? Ideally only backing them up if they are changed from the default.

 After some time it stops seeing other local devices on the same network. I can’t ping them. Also, it shows duplicate WiFi network SSIDs (SSID_1, SSID_2 and so on). I can browse internet and ping my router just fine. Everything becomes normal when I reset network in Windows settings.
 I’ve tried reinstalling drivers, updating drivers.

 imagine you could read out data of any SaaS application, what would it be? I’d like to understand use-cases you might have.
 Here are some examples to get you going:
  
Downloading invoices from Asana, Notion etc.
 Get a list of projects from Asana as CSV
 Get a list of users with their permission in Jira as CSV
  
What use-case for which application(s) would be interesting for you and why? Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a new BT router that offers 4G failover as we get the odd line outage causing issues to our business. Before I plugged the BT line direct into firewall WAN port but in order for the 4G to work I meed to keep the BT router.
 Do i stick the router in modem mode, DMZ mode on the port going to firewall (so dont have dual port forwarding for VPN) or just setup the BT router as say 192.168.1.1 subnet and the main network 192.168.20.1 subnet so theres 2 essential?
 Just wondering on which you guys say is the best way to do this as im use to just pluggin direct into firewalls?

                              <span>Here we go, another Monday. And there&#x27;s some shit burning right from the start. 
 One of our department&#x27;s LAN is not working for some reason. Everyone suddenly starts to make calls. Let&#x27;s say - understandable. But then one thing gets above all and I just want to scream.
 One person just gets ahead and writes about the existing problem to my facebook messenger... Like what the heck? Why would you do that? If you have some mobile internet then why not write to our HelpDesk? Or at least e-mail or the messenger we use in work? Why would you write to a messenger I never use for work and is only personal? I mean I will probably just block that person over there. Or at least ignore.
 I&#x27;m sorry for this rant but I really don&#x27;t get some people. Why do they want to bother us so much?
 Do you guys have similar experiences? How do you deal with it?

Then a new tech gets reassigned and same issue. I&#x27;ve seen some posts online requesting help from Microsoft, and same someone always comes asking for logs, and then nothing is ever heard again.
 Is this a common experience with them?

 I still see MCSA and MCSE being required for some job postings, so I was wondering what the current equivalent exams for these certifications are.
 Thank you.

 Somebody just noticed that Bitlocker doesn&#x27;t run, or at least, the recovery key doesn&#x27;t get recorded in AD... if the computer object isn&#x27;t deleted before. Is this by design, and is somebody able to explain why?

It&#x27;s a level of training I cannot dedicate given the current workload without completely burning out.
 Its been just over a month and I think I need to pull the plug. The last month has had me at the brink of burn out with basically doing both of our jobs and trying to train them as well. I can see things are not sinking in and can out right see them not paying attention during training sessions.
 I feel it would be easier going back to solo and looking for a replacement, but does this all seem too soon, or I&#x27;m asking/expecting too much? 
 Expectations were I could assign them switch configuration tasks and they could handle them no problem, as long as proper documentation was provided. It was provided and they seem utterly lost, and I&#x27;ve ended up essentially doing the work.

 https://bgp.he.net/AS6667#_whois
 It has a section for &quot;Customers&quot;, which shows that the ISP advertises all prefixes to their customers
 It also has a section for each &quot;Peer&quot;, which shows that the ISP advertises its customers prefixes and its own prefixes.
 AND, the last section is &quot;Upstreams&quot;, so is that referring to the ISPs that my ISP is the customer of? 
 e.g the upstream ISPs advertise their routing tables for my ISP so my ISP can route through them. (my ISP obviously has to pay to them right?)

 Our main office currently has a pair of 6807XL&#x27;s in VSS, someday we&#x27;ll need to replace them. Seems Cisco bumped the EOL by a few years due to supply chain issues, but the topic of lifecycle came up recently. The long story short is: We&#x27;re not sure we need a chassis platform for this office, but Cisco obviously wants to upsell us and immediately flipped shit when we brought up the idea of running our &quot;data center&quot; off a stack of 9300X&#x27;s. 
 I use the term &quot;data center&quot; sparingly since there is no Nexus, fabric, routing protocols, VXLAN, etc. happening. We&#x27;ve got less than a hundred 1G copper and about a dozen 10G fiber ports lit at the moment, a chunk of the copper is MGMT interfaces. …</span>

                              <span>Hey, guys! I wish someone could lend me some wisdom please! 
 I have this cenario:
 vWLC --&gt; core sw --&gt; dist sw --&gt; acess sw --&gt; 12xAP&#x27;s 1852 --&gt; SSID &lt;-- AP&#x27;s2852 WGB &lt;-- siemens PLC &lt;-- moving car.
 the siemens PLC is a passive client with a fixed ip, because we use a virtual WLC i can&#x27;t activate the passive client option, so there is no arp resquest reaching the PLC, so from time to time the arp cache in the switches gets cleaned and lost connectivity. As a workaround, I created a simple pyhton script that goes into WGB and pings the PLC to generate some traffic, but I need a more professional solution. Do you guys have any suggestion to this issue?

                              <span>These things are driving me nuts. I inherited a shit show. No professional site survey before AP deployment. Have multiple zones, that my predecessor installed where apparently one new AP can do the coverage of two old APs. Laptops and mobile work stations do fine with roaming and connectivity. Using Ascom i63 phones with Ruckus R730s, SmartZone as the controller. Phones are on 5Ghz band. Phones register with the pbx. User complaints are poor roaming and &quot;ghost calls&quot; where the phones will ring to a bridged extension but I assume packets arrive late due to high latency (they rarely go over 50ms on the AP) and the phone rings but caller not on the other end.
 Followed the interrop report from Ruckus/Ascom to set up the WLAN. The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. 
 I have been concentrating on one zone at a time. I got them to work better in two zones just by moving the APs further away from each other or deleting one or two. I do my own Netspot surveys and do not find coverage to be the issue. I am thinking more that co channel interference is the big issue here however neither company can point out exactly what the issue is. Does anyone have experience with this? It&#x27;s the no professional site survey isn&#x27;t it?

                              <span>I always thought that connecting networks together to form the Internet was just about physical connectivity, but when reading this paper:
 https://web.mit.edu/6.033/2009/wwwdocs/assignments/InterdomainRouting.pdf
 It seems that its more about if an ISP is willing to route for other ISPs?
 e.g Just because two networks or ISPs can easily be connected physically, doesnt automatically mean that they are gonna connect and start routing packets for each other

                              <span>Hi,
 I am seeking ways to enhance the overall security of our SSL VPN by limiting access to only corporate laptops. We have Sophos UTM9 Firewall.
 I am considering the option of utilizing SSL VPN with a Certificate. However, I am uncertain about how to configure it. Currently, we have RADIUS authentication with AD and Duo 2FA.
 Moreover, I am concerned about the possibility of the certificate being exported by end-users, which would enable them to import it into other devices and undermine our efforts to limit access to corporate laptops. 
 Would it be necessary to implement NPS to achieve this? If yes, how can I configure it?
 I am open to considering other quick solutions. 
 Any help or insights on how to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated.

 So I am looking to set up a network for an industrial application. I will do my best to explain the intended architecture, but fee offer suggestions on this point as well. Starting off, there will be a layer 3 switch capable of inter-VLAN routing. I plan to assign a specific VLAN ID and IP Address to each port. Connected to each port will be a machine consisting of 3-4 lightly managed switches (addresses in the same subnet as the VLAN with the VLANs IP Address as the gateway). Connected to the lightly managed switches will be 40-60 Ethernet/IP devices, including a PLC and, on some machines, a PC.…</span>

 I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere the info about the BGP and stackwise switch/es. I have two separate /30 eBGP connections, each terminated to a different physical switch. SVIs, default GWs for user vlans, are also configured on the same stackwise switch 
 If active switch goes down, will the standby continue to forward traffic from a BGP perspective?

 What I need is getting alarms when AP comes up or goes down. Root cause alarms, so I don&#x27;t get seperate alarms for all APs on a switch if the switch goes down.
 Aggregation of data. I have multiple wireless controllers so I need graphs on total number of users (per SSID).
 Other graphs and alarms on WiFi-related problems.
 This is in addition to monitoring a multivendor switched and SD-WAN network. 
 Which product would you recommend me? It is ok if it costs money.

                              <span>I know we all hate those little yellow Post-It notes with passwords, but…
 So this week my childhood best friend’s brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He was barely fifty. The family had no idea where to start. They didn’t know if he had a will and, if so, who might be the executor. They didn’t know his financial relationships. They didn’t know his insurance policies. They didn’t know who his lawyer was. He was somewhat secretive, and they were stumped.
 What they did have was a stack of four laptops, ranging from his current laptop to plan older one circa 2004. They brought them to me to see if I could “hack” into them and glean anything that might point them in the right direction. I promised I would do what I could.
 I started with the only one that had a power adapter. I was lucky enough that the default account, “user”, had no password and had admin rights. I logged in, reset the password for his account, and started hunting. I found a few work-related documents and some photos of his kids and not much else.
 Next, I gathered all the old laptop chargers I had around and tried to fit the laptops. No luck. Where is my universal charger? ugh. Anyway, I opened one of the laptops and what comes fluttering out? A single Post-It Note. I though, “Please let this be a password”. We all know that is the main use of these damn yellow sticky papers, right? Well it wasn’t, but it was just as good. It was a list of names and phone numbers. Lawyer. Banker. Investment advisor. Insurance agent. Mortgage broker. The works.
 Anyway, thank God for little yellow notes, but I still need to get into the laptops. Anyone have any recommendations for boot sticks that might permit resetting SAM accounts, mounting file systems, etc? I used to use Trinity Rescue Kit, but that was half a career ago. I am also hoping nothing is encrypted; wish me luck.
 Thanks.

                              <span>A bit off-topic for the group but guessing we all likely spend an inordinate amount of time sitting. Too much time. So I am shopping around for an adjustable work table. Electrical so I can pre-set it and have it adjust quickly and easily. So I can spend some time in a chair and some time standing. Curious what other WFH folks are doing to take care of themselves when working long hours at the computer.

                              <span>I am in the process of installing &quot;PERC H310&quot; cards on two Dell PowerEdge R510 servers (to remplace the &quot;PERC H700&quot; and &quot;PERC 6/i&quot; they were originally shipped with, to gain JBOD/passthrough support).
 But I can&#x27;t simply re-use the original SAS cables: connectors are different and card are in different PCI slot (so length is not the same).
 Here are some pictures:
 Pictures 1 and 2: SAS sockets on the backplane:
 https://wtf.roflcopter.fr/pics/XiwTIFvE/IxaHwTFl

 Picture 5: Sockets on PERC H310:
 https://wtf.roflcopter.fr/pics/DCpMjMYF/c31SgmeW
 So I need cables with same plugs as pictures 3 and 4 on one side, and compatible with socket of picture 5.
 Could you please help me to identify the plugs/connectors names so that I can find+order the one I need?
 Thanks

                              <span>I have about 1TB and growing of personal files (mostly old games I have backed up, family pics etc...) On mirrored drives. I would like to back it up to the cloud using veeam. Do you guys have any recommendations on a good cloud storage service for this purpose? Amazon S3 looks good. Idrive had some good offerings as well. I strangely enough have no work experience with using these services. We always backed up to a NAS at a data center for work. What say you fellow Sysadmins?

 My team is looking for an asset management system with more granular permissions than Snipe-IT has. We&#x27;d like to allow certain people in the org to view, check in and check out specific objects and devices.
 Ideally an open source software as we are big Open Source supporters and advocates.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I’m in my early 30’s and 6 months ago became the lone IT guy in a medium sized business (~200 devices). I currently work with an MSP who has dropped the ball quite a few times and has long lead times. I personally feel they can’t adequately support the user base in a timely fashion. 
 Currently, I’m not unhappy with the job, but I find myself a bit bored after I got myself up to speed on the infrastructure and the security improvements that needed to be made. My job also shifts rapidly from providing level 1-3 tech support along with sys admin tasks. I find myself wanting co-workers to bounce ideas off of, but I don’t have that outlet here. I’m getting the itch to move onto something else, but I’m not sure where I want to land and how to get there. I like the sysadmin side of things and implementing sensible security policies. 
 Has anyone been in a similar position before? Where did you wind up?

                              <span>OK, so i started a new tech support job at a huge medical service company, we support in-house users and outside contractors. Basically, we support close to 10k-12k users. my job is to DIRECTLY receive calls from users and catalog it in a CRM software (pivotal). Yes, i do the tech support, and I also have to document everything that happened during the call. Now I average about 50-60 calls a day, and I&#x27;m expected to average 8 minutes per call(which doesn&#x27;t really happen but ok), and as you know IT problems tend to repeat themselves so i lack to see the logic of logging EVERY call and step I did. There is basically no ticketing system implemented, and it is really maddening when you come to think of it. What&#x27;s your take on this? I&#x27;m 4 months in, and I&#x27;m already kinda burned out.

 About 4 years ago, after a security incident my company decided that AWS was the future and on-prem data center was the way of the dinosaur.
 It&#x27;s that typical horror story where I have to assume something similar to the CEOs friend touted AWS while on the golf course and then issued the decree that we were going to the cloud. 3 years ago they said we&#x27;d be fully in AWS in 3 years. Migrations ground to a halt last year when a mid tier clients AWS environment blew by their annual costs to run in the DC in just 3 months at a fraction of the performance.
 Since the beginning they&#x27;ve been systematically promoting people who have a positive outlook on AWS and telling those who do not that they are not culturally fitting well with the company and driving the…</span>

 We’re also looking at a way that we can force sensitive documents to stay within a repository to prevent peaks to the outside world. For example, a financial doc that sits on our financial share shouldn’t be able to be copied off. However, our documents are so scattershot we have no idea what users have already squirreled away on their machines.
 We’re developing policy for these things now, but I’d love suggestions on tools / techniques used to enforce it. 
 Any input is very much appreciated
 Edit:
 We use Microsoft and Apple workstations, Windows and Linux servers, Google Workspaces and Office 365, On prem AD that syncs to Azure AD (so a hybrid AD environment)
 Our file servers are on prem. We have a lot of data in Google Drive and higher up’s are wanting to open up O365 for users to put docs in.

                              <span>Apart from ansible or similar scripting tools, is there a standard way to manage ssh keys for your server? The context is when a team member leaves, I’ve no clue of their access. There’s no documentation that keeps track of it. So I need to ssh to each server and remove their key if found. First problem is keep the access documented which is already in process but apart from that is there’s anything which will help like SSO, where the identity is linked to AD and once their account is made inactive they shouldn’t be able to authenticate.
 I thought of writing a script which talks to AD server and allow/deny login using SSHCMD or something and keep it in every server but in event of AD failure it’d be impossible to login to any server. But it seems like a hack than a standard procedure.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m wondering what everyone thinks the best remote desktop software is.
 Obviously Windows Desktop is probably the easiest. TeamViewer is another that is pretty common (although IIRC they had some drama about them being compromised).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always had trouble in interviews, and I feel a lot of that is because I&#x27;m entirely honest. If my skills in an area are particularly strong I will tell them, and if they are a bit weak in other areas I&#x27;ll tell them too (but of course I&#x27;ll tell them that&#x27;s an area I&#x27;m actively working on).
 I&#x27;ve stuck to honesty because I don&#x27;t want to get a job that I can&#x27;t do. The problem is that I then don&#x27;t get much success from my interviews. 
 I have been involved in interviews and seen that a lot of candidates just lie and say they can do anything they get asked about and then come unstuck when it comes to the technical interview.
 ​
 So my question is - am I wrong for being honest? How much does everyone else embellish (or just plain lie)?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 Quick question, hopefully someone can assist, this is the first time I have properly configured STP rather than set the defaults and run, and I am not 100% sure if I should even have it enabled over the MC-LAG links for the Juniper Top of Rack or leaf switch stack.
 The link below is an example of the network layout I am configuring.
 https://imgur.com/a/B5bAy5J
 Should I disable RSTP and VSTP on the Juniper, on the MC-LAG interface to the core switch? Currently it is set up with RSTP, the MC-LAG interfaces are set to point to point and other interfaces are edge, the ICL between the stack has RSTP disabled, and it&#x27;s set block BPDU on edge.
 The Cisco portion of the network has Rapid-PVST+, the core is the root bridge, the others are default, access ports are portfast, etc. basic Cisco set up really.
 I am not sure if I should disable all STP on the MC-LAG interfaces to the core and management switch, the MC-LAG stack is an aggregate switch stack, should it just pass through the BPDU packets? I believe this is what the Juniper documentation is getting at but it&#x27;s a little wishy washy on that. This would basically leave Cisco to run STP on its network, and just leave the rack alone. Or do I pass through the packets and enable Rapid-PVST+ on the management switch, on the other side of the Juniper MC-LAG?
 Or should I also be setting up the Juniper MC-LAG stack to be handling the incoming BPDU packets from the Cisco? I would have to add PVST to it as well for interoperability, I am just not sure how this may affect the RSTP running locally, which was recommended to be enabled by Junipers docs.
 Any help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to embark on switchport-based network access control for a wired network.
 I have about 80 VLANs. I need NAC for about only 10 of them because they&#x27;re more sensitive than the other 70.
 My environment:
 -Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices -Meraki switches (MS390) -Wired network (we aren&#x27;t looking to do NAC for WiFi) -We want only device-based authentication so everyone on an authorized device can use it on that VLAN; have no use for user-based auth -Budget for this is almost $0 -We currently have an on-prem AD environment but it&#x27;s gradually going away in favor of Azure AD
 If you were to do port-based NAC for devices on a few VLANs today, which solution would you use? I am currently shying away from Microsoft NPS because we are dismantling ADCS and our overall on-prem infrastructure.

 I know that ping TTL is unique to some devices but this is not something that always works as many vendors share the same TTL value. Are there ports usually open on a router that aren&#x27;t on a PC? I suppose you could use host name too?
 Any ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if someone can point me in the right direction: I&#x27;m looking into assigning a block of addresses to each user when using corporate Wi-Fi that they can use for their respective devices when connecting to Wi-Fi with their laptops/phones/other misc. equipment. 
 - A user logs into wifi with their credentials (802.1x)
 - Each user is assigned a fixed subnet (a /28 in the 10 space, and a /64 in the v6 space) for their devices
 - The users would retain this block of addresses for the duration of their engagement with the organization. (Some of these users would have additional rules as well to coincide with regulatory requirements, or other reasons, these would most likely take place at the router and firewall levels) 
 I was investigating the possibility of using radius to assign a different vlan to each individual with the contained subnets, however this gets unruly assigning a different private vlan to several hundred different users. I&#x27;m wondering if there is a better solution out there someone could point me in the right direction. I&#x27;m working with Aruba hardware. 
 If someone can point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it. I&#x27;m recently reentering the network design world and discovering I&#x27;m forgetting more than I remember about this topic.

                              <span>Conservatives in red states say proposals to restrain the transgender movement have also faced an uphill battle and often fail. In this episode of Morning Wire, Daily Wire culture reporter Megan Basham explains why trans activists have managed to find legislative success even in the red states. And why Republican lawmakers often go against the will of their own voters on social issues. Get the facts first on Morning Wire.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 Looking to learn a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; sort of speak network setup for small business.
 Yes... I do realize every business is different but the best way for me to learn is to have a goal and work towards meeting that requirement.
 Theoretical scope would be a small business such as a coffee shop, auto mechanic, dental office, insurance office, etc. Consisting of 10 ppl or less with computers, printers, mobile devices, 2-3 IP cameras, a file server or two, with occasional guests.
 Internet line would probably range from 200mb-1gb down and 50mb-200mb up
 My thoughts on equipment that would cover this range would be:
 ISP Modem &gt; Router &gt; Firewall &gt; Switches &gt; APs
 ISP Modem &gt; Netgate 2100 &gt; Unifi Switch Lite 8 POE &gt; Unifi U6 Lite(s)
 Ive used Ubiquiti gear before so I think the POE switch and AP&#x27;s would be a good fit. 
 Netgate 2100 is the router firewall VPN appliance I think I&#x27;m settling in to learn.
 Would this setup be a realistic real world configuration for a small business? 
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to learn this and implement this into friends and family&#x27;s businesses as a side hustle then expand to regular customers to grow even more.
 Thanks for your help and time!

 Any benefit to breaking up a single RAID into multiple partitions for a server other than organization?
 I understand it helps prevent the OS drive from filling, but other than that any other benefits?
 Say you have a Hyper-V server and you do one of the following:
 Raid5 - &gt; 5TB
 C: drive &#x3D; 200GB D: drive(Virtual disks) &#x3D; 4TB E: Drive(snapshots) &#x3D; 800GB 
 Versus:
 C: drive &#x3D; 200GB D: drive(Everything else) &#x3D; 4.8TB

                              <span>I&#x27;m out of touch. It&#x27;s been a few years (~10) since I built a new monitoring system and I&#x27;m looking for suggestions. Back in the day I had a nice Nagios setup with groundwork open source. I exposed the cgi-bin via a reverse proxy that required client certificates. Installed aNag app on my Android device and had a widget on my phone home screen. Net result was that if I (as an example) dropped a disk from my md-raid, my phone would get an active alert within 5 minutes.
 Now in 2023 I am looking to start fresh and ask for suggestions on a completely new monitoring system that meets that requirement. What will alert me within 5-10 minutes of a failed disk, to my Android phone? Active monitoring only, not something that pushes an email or something, since if that system failed, it could fail quiet. 
 All clients to be monitored are Linux and I&#x27;m only interested in free and open source tools. Right now I&#x27;m leaning towards checkmk/omd.

 SQL Service starts but remote connections over SSMS would throw this error.
 Cannot connect to SERVERNAME.
 The Target principal name is incorrect. Cannot generate SSPI conext (Microsoft SQL Server).
 I googled the error and it came down to a SPN issue. Basically the the gMSA account was unable to register SPN. I tried to register manually but AD said there was duplicate entry already.
 To finish the move to the new cluster I ended up creating an old school service account and set SQL to use it then remote connections to SSMS began working. 
 Any ideas why this gMSA didn&#x27;t work. The 2 servers are in an AD group that I used when I generated the gMSA account. Any ideas, did I miss something?

 Two possible strategies for booting hosts from their assigned LUN:
  
Identical host HBA configs --they all get the same target WWPNs and target LUN ID. The pairing of each host to its designated LUN is done on the array side (i.e. each LUN is presented to only one host via export with the common LUN ID. For this project I&#x27;m using LUN zero everywhere).
 Present the basket of boot LUNs to the entire cluster of hosts; each LUN is &quot;exported&quot; with a unique LUN ID. Pair each host with its designated LUN by setting the appropriate target LUN ID on the host HBAs.
  
The first method strikes me as cleaner and safer. It&#x27;s one less touch-point to worry about as hosts will have i…</span>

                              <span>I have a windows machine several hundred miles away that I&#x27;ve been connecting with Anydesk for years. For some reason, I&#x27;m stuck at &quot;Connection in Progress&quot;. I have Pulseway (and file sync software) on it so I&#x27;ve restarted the computer a couple of times with that. I&#x27;m trying to a remote desktop program that I could just copy to that computer, launch it from Pulseway&#x27;s command line, and connect to it. It would have to be something that doesn&#x27;t require any input like a EULA, and where I&#x27;d already know the ID/password. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 Saw a TMobile add about internet access and was wondering if anyone has ever used them as a backup internet provider?
 The scenario I was looking at is a restaurant that can only get one internet provider in the complex due to contracts. Main goal is to be sure POS and Alarm system still has connectivity then a few computers have basic low speeds 5mb+- to get by till the main internet line is resolved.
 Has anyone tried this or had some other cellular internet provider as fail over?
 Thanks for your time!

 I&#x27;m tasked with getting an Azure AD Sync setup for a new client. Their old provider got hit with something that destroyed their old AD, so we have a completely new domain stood up. 
 I attempted to sync with setting the immutable IDs but it still shows the old on-premise distinguished name and on-premises domain name in Azure AD. 
 Is there anything that I need to do to get this to sync? I can&#x27;t find any method to clear out AD sync data from Azure other than clearing out the immutable IDs and &quot;Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false&quot;

If I bring up the backup to be the one tied to the floating ip address is there an iproute2 command or config file to be assured that that backup is the one that is using the floating ip address? I might not have the terminology correct since I&#x27;m not really a sysadmin just a developer.

Black screen trying to RDP in to server
 
Services are down, and not able to open applications on servers
 
Server Manager error message at login. &quot;This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action...&quot;
 
Taskmgr.exe error message &quot;No such interface supported.&quot;
 
 Which means most of business is down.
 The root cause seems to be related to file permissions changes in the GPO

 https://i.imgur.com/Jx9ZJLI.png
 Manually restoring the permissions has been tried, but it was unsuccessful. Reverting the GPOs does not solve the issue as it does not revert the changes.
 It was supposed to go to test first. Unluckily it was applied to server OU. We&#x27;ll of course take care of the administrator who did it, this is quite an unfortunate event. Is full restore the only way to go, or is it possible to fix it? Any ideas fellow sysadmins?
 Edit: The servers are not receiving updates to GPOs anymore. Any changes you do/remove/add a GPO will not be updated to any servers.
 Update from the morning of 19.02.2023: Shit guys we&#x27;re deep in it, the restores are failing for some reason. Complete rebuild has been initiated while we are trying to find workarounds and get Microsoft escalation.
  
Some servers you cannot reach at all, while others you can actually get access to through management tools or run wmic.
 Domain Controllers not affected, GPO was applied to servers OU

                              <span>Sorry if this is a dumb question. I&#x27;m not a sysadmin myself, in fact I&#x27;m pretty new to the IT world.
 I was tasked with connecting my org&#x27;s SSO solution to our Google domain so we could use 2FA. I thought I had set it up wrong because when I logged out and back in, there was no redirect to the SSO page; it just took my Google password as always. I did some digging and apparently the reason is that I&#x27;m a Super Admin for our domain and Google doesn&#x27;t allow Super Admin accounts to use SSO (unless you&#x27;re signing in from within a network mask...which I don&#x27;t understand). I then tested it with multiple end user accounts, and the SSO redirect worked correctly.
 I&#x27;m confused. Wouldn&#x27;t the Super Admin accounts have the biggest need for protection? These are the accounts with the highest privileges. I must be missing something here, right?
 Edit: I understand now. In my head I was thinking SSO implied 2FA, which it doesn&#x27;t. You wouldn&#x27;t want an admin account to be using SSO without 2FA but Google can&#x27;t really enforce that without ruling out SSO altogether. I&#x27;ll change the post flair. Thanks y&#x27;all!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am taking over multiple (but small) Hyperflex environments. HCI is a new concept for me over a traditional FC SAN, but I am quickly learning. I have extensive experience with break/fix of UCS servers and VMware, but I&#x27;ve never administered it on a large scale before. I&#x27;ve seen enough broken VMware setups to have a general idea of what not to do, and what to do. However, I recognize I have quite a bit to learn :)
 I am looking for &quot;pro tips&quot; on steps I should take when I take over the environment. I figured the veteran sysadmin wizards here have taken over an environment before and have thought &quot;I wish I did X sooner&quot;. This is the practical and actionable advice I&#x27;m looking for.
 Here are some things I&#x27;ve compiled so far:

 Check your accounts when you check your backups.

                              <span>Hi,
 we are currently looking into switching to MFA through Azure AD with our Endpoint VPN solution. Everything fine so far except one part of the organization who use the VPN solution, but are not synchronized to our main Azure AD. They use their own Azure tenant.
 Synching them to ours as well (and license them) is not an option.
 I read about cross tenant access. But I don&#x27;t get how I should be able to select a group from the other tenant in my Conditional Access policy for the App that controls the VPN solution.
 Do I have to look into B2B direct connect and somehow synchronize these users into our tenant? I would not want that. I tried adding a group through B2B direct connect that is allowed to access my tenant, hoping I could then select that group in CA - but it seems that&#x27;s not how it works.
 Any hints appreciated - thanks!

 Long story short I have a homelab, got a 16 core cpu running VM ware. Is it possible, trying to squeeze as many VMs I can out of this thing.
 Im only going to be running group policy for just me and the wife, some deployment stuff and NFS.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>The Managed service provider that I&#x27;ve been working at for 2 years had an absolutely fabulous time over the last 3 days. 
 On Wednesday a vmware horizon VDI server that was stood up last week was compromised because the technicians responsible didn&#x27;t install the log4j patched version of the server. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved.
 On Thursday a client&#x27;s email was suspended due to breaching the terms of service of the incumbent email provider who they were still paying for service that is well below the tier of RackSpace because sales would not insist that a modern email service be used. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved. 
 I inherited the job of migrating an imap email server to m365 with an expected completion date of Friday whilst being the escalation point for 10 L1 technicians. This went as expected. 
 Last night I went home and had a panic attack. Theoretically if I cared enough about the client migration I would be working on all weekend but I don&#x27;t because we were able to get the old email vendor to re-establish the account until we can migrate, I&#x27;m spending time on Indeed, Monster &amp; Dice trying to find a life boat out of this hellhole.
 The point of this post is to never, ever, trust an MSP with your environment past the point of giving them a runbook or utilizing them for L1 helpdesk. Never give them administrator credentials. 
 If you ever think about being coerced into working for an MSP stick your hand in a rat trap, remember the pain, and realize that MSP is the hotel California of the IT profession. 
 Once you have that stink on you it&#x27;s hard to get it off.

                              <span>This has us stumped.
 Client has Windows 11 HP Notebooks, USB-C docks and Kyocera MFPs. KX Universal Printer Driver (v.8.3.0815).
 / Scenario A Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print, then click Print 
 / Scenario B Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print  [Killing Printer process makes Word resume]
 / Scenario C No Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print 
 This can only be reproduced:
  
When the Dock is attached (whether using LAN or WiFi).
 When the Printer Properties are viewed (to change colour, tray, etc).
  
If we disconnect the Dock, use LAN, all works fine.
 We have uninstalled AV, Office Add-ins, updated drivers, Windows update etc. 
 It does work with other printers and print drivers, but the client needs the Universal Printer Driver.
 I’ve ran Procmon and can see ‘Print Isolation Host’ doing it’s thing, touching Kyocera DLLs, and have captures from successful and failed prints. Nothing jumps out.
 The fact the dock is a factor makes me think there’s some kind of conflict or memory issue. 
 Any suggestions welcomed!

 I was looking into Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ and found that the former has a supplementary system named Apache Connect, which essentially allows to use a bunch of third-party connectors as event sources or event sinks.
 E.g. with Kafka, if I wanted to make an event “NewUserCreated” when a new row is inserted into Postgres database’s users table, I can just use a Postgres connector and configure it as event source (haven’t tried yet actually but I understand so). With Confluent, I can configure all of this with a visual GUI.
 But with RabbitMQ, would I need to be making custom connector scripts? E.g postgres database allows webhook trigger, so I make a cloud (edge) function that connects to RabbitMQ and sends the event.
 Or is there something analogous to Apache Connect but designed for AMQP message brokers like RabbitMQ?

                              <span>Hoping someone else will have come across this. Generally speaking we purchase all devices through Apple Business account so it will already be in the Apple Business Manager but every now and then there’s a need for us (or a client) to purchase directly and the. Add to ABM manually. 
 What’s winding me up is how inconsistent this experience is.
 Normally it’s as simple as switch the device on, get to the WiFi part of setup and then if fire up Apple Configurator on another iPhone that’s signed into ABM, it detects this and the new device is added to the ABM. You then need to immediately change the MDM to InTune on ABM and force an InTune to ABM sync before you allow it factory reset. It’s then hit and miss on whether or not the device will get stuck at the “obtaining configuration from org” screen. So it’s already a bit flaky even for orgs where this is about as simple as it can be (single profile for that enrollment method) but “tends” to work. 
 That’s annoying but I can live with it. What’s annoying me more is that on some new devices fresh out of the box (and old that are factory reset) they refuse to pair up at the WiFi screen, nothing happens at all. Trying to find information on troubleshooting that aspect seems impossible. Very few people using the iOS Apple Configurator App it seems. 
 Posting here in the hopes that someone else has come across the issues above and has any advice on troubleshooting either of them?

 What kind of naming convention are used at your company, does it work good or does it have potential to be better? how?
 ​
 We have this standard: ---
 This don&#x27;t work so good because they are not marked with asset tag.
 Suggestions for a more optimal way?
 I am thinking about --- or something like that

 I’ve been lurking here for a while as I’ve been a sysadmin/ whatever cloud role is equivalent to it for a few years now.
 I’ve started to build a company with a co-worker that tries to help sysadmins and MSPs with actually useful software at a fair price.
 Is it allright if I asks some questions on this subreddit regarding what we should be doing/building? I really don’t want to develop just based on our own experience..
 Not sure if it’s appropriate hence me asking.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently in an IT position where I&#x27;m underpaid, a salary increase has not come and career growth has been coming very slowly - but the work culture, environment and boss have been good. I&#x27;m thinking of leaving but I shudder when I think of the potentially toxic environments that I may get into even though the pay may improve. My country is extremely notorious for having toxic corporate environments, weak labor laws, zero percent worker protection, political infiltration, and managers that are clueless &amp; wicked, etc such that you actually find people quitting their good-paying jobs because of toxic environments -that is what I&#x27;m contemplating getting into. My current workplace doesn&#x27;t stress me, the people are civil and the processes are professional and standardized. I consider myself blessed to be formally employed in a country with a 90% unemployment rate but my salary just barely scratches the surface as compared to equally qualified and experienced counterparts in other companies.

 Is it possible to somehow re-use a selfencrypting drive secured with a tool called Wave?
 Diskpart and Mac Disk Utility could not. Both report it to be some weird smaller capacity partitions than the disk actually is. These were old corporate notebook disks.
 Any ideas? Thank you

                              <span>Hi All
 We have Windows 10 (going to Windows 11 shortly) Hybrid Azure AD joined devices with LAPS setup. We are working towards getting our devices into Intune but aren’t there yet. 
 Remote devices have BitLocker with a Pin setup, and we had a theft of a laptop recently and luckily the device was BitLockered with decent pin, we reset user password and revoked 365 sessions for good measure – end of IT’s involvement. Everyone in our org has MFA enforced, we have configured recommended Conditional Access policies and we generally follow best practice where we can.
 But it got me thinking, if that laptop had not had a BitLocker Pin (TPM ONLY) or the Pin was weak (or user had written it down on a post-it note in the laptop bag…….) what would the thief been able to access? They wouldn’t have been able to caddy the drive due to TPM but could they have booted off a USB utility tool (Hiren or whatever it is now) and reset the Administrator password and then logged in as local admin and had access to the local user profiles and data?
 If so, is there anyway to mitigate this? I also note that deploying devices via Intune/AutoPilot, there is no out of the box/automated way of setting a unique TPM pin which wages a debate about if pin is even necessary.

                              <span>In the past 4 years that I&#x27;ve worked for my organization as helpdesk support, i&#x27;ve come to realize that i&#x27;m somewhat faster than my boss or management/HR in knowing or initiating the next career growth steps or the daily work tasks that I need to carry out. I&#x27;ve in a couple of cases brought up clearly detailed requests for career advancements, daily tasks upgrades etc to my boss but they would get shot down, only for him to come back to me 6 or 8 months later with pretty much 90% of what i had proposed before -as if i had handed him a template. Sometimes its him who would have said to me tell me what you think you need to do or focus on next then i sit down for like a week detailing something only for it to get shot down -it kinda feels like its some secret spying or HR thing that they are doing on me. I feel my career progression is going slooow. I&#x27;m a fast learner and could really move on to other areas. Most of my tasks i have automated, optimized or streamlined into playbooks such that i really have some time on my hands but nope I&#x27;m still in the same position and same tasks.

                              <span>Ok, this should probably fall under the shittysysadmin thread, because that&#x27;s how I feel.... I hope I&#x27;m worrying for nothing. We have a 3 node HCI cluster that hosts about 80 virtual machines. We use Veeam to backup these servers. We have a separate stand-alone hyper-v host that hosts our Veeam servers - a broker server and a proxy. This server has a dual port 10GB card in it. I ordered and received a server to replace this stand-alone hyper-v host. I worked with our vendor to order the new server spec&#x27;d like our current server. I don&#x27;t know where the breakdown happened (I know I screwed up), but the new server did not come with the 2 10GB (SPF+) ports. To make matters worse, there are no available slots in install a card. Before I tell my boss we spent $25K on a server that we can&#x27;t use, I&#x27;d like some feedback. This server&#x27;s sole use is hosting these 2 Veeam servers. The network ports I have are 1GB. How screwed am I? I won&#x27;t lose my job over this, but feel like a noob....

                              <span>Alittle bit of backround about myself: I have recieved my CCNA back in 2018 and have 2+ years of Networking expierence in a manage service provider. I have a really good understanding of network fundamentals but have been out of practice now for 2 years since I got a new job more on the incident management side of things for a video game company. 
 I am looking for some resources to help me acquire the JNCIA-Junos certificate so I can make the jump to our networking department who uses mostly Juniper devices. When I was studying for my CCNA I got lucky and found a community college near me that offered a 1 year crash course to prep you for the CCNA. This included hands on labs and a ton of reading. I managed to get my CCNA after 2 tries and really enjoyed the networking job I had except for the fact that they where paying me 40k a year in Los Angeles which basically meant I was poor. 
 What I am looking for is some resources to study for the JNCIA this can include:
 Websites
 Youtube training videos
 Online paid courses
 Text books
 Anything really to help get comfortable with the Juniper command line 
 I am willing to pay for courses so anyting helps please. If anyone here has passed there JNCIA lets have a conversation. There are some oppertunities at my job for Networking but they are all for Juniper devices which I am not familiar with.

                              <span>Hello all-
 I handle networking for pro-av AVoIP applications including SDVoE and smpte 2110. These devices essentially all rely on multicasting, IGMP, and are in the realm of 10Gb to 25Gb per device/host. One issue that i&#x27;ve seen frequently in some courses panels in regards to switch stacking, is that by stacking switches you can quickly run into severe multicast flooding. Arista deals with this through what they call &quot;Multi-cast Orchestration&quot; on their own switches, and Netgear acknowledges it&#x27;s an issue and says &quot;Care should be taken&quot; when stacking switches- however I haven&#x27;t heard anyone mention how to actually prevent or stop that multicast flooding on a network without something like Arista&#x27;s proprietary product. Is there a common approach to handling this I&#x27;m not aware of or some 3rd party product which can handle this? What is the &quot;care&quot; you would even take to prevent that form of multicast flooding? 
 The reason for the stacked switches is to achieve 100% redundancy, allow easier expandability, etc.

                              <span>Hi, some of this may seem like an obvious answer, and some might not, but I&#x27;m going to go with it anyway. I&#x27;m essentially looking for a brief explanation or clarification on how I think the two are different and the same.
 Regarding WiFi first (because its easier), as well all know, radio waves that transmit over 2.4ghz, 5ghz and 6ghz ranges and different QAM modulations which allow for more bits to be grouped together, allowing for faster speeds. Each frequency has its own wavelength that it transmits off, the higher the frequency goes up, the more &quot;aggressive&quot; the wavelength, allowing for faster speeds again in combination with QAM etc... the lower end wireless frequencies (2.4ghz) have a &quot;wider&quot; wavelength, allowing for radio waves to travel further, at greatly reduced speeds and more i…</span>

                              <span>We are currently scoping out firewall vendors for a potential replacement. Top 3 are Palo Alto, Fortinet, and Checkpoint. We have had Fortinet’s technical demo and have heard their claim that they are “best” due to a mix of value, ease of use and performance (Paralell Processing). Palo is scheduled this week to discuss why they are the best.
 our IT security team is pushing Checkpoint hard. Their basis is it’s the most secure and point to 2 things. Testing showing that they block way more attacks than all the others and a claim that there are no CVEs in the last 8 years. The first item I’m disregarding because it’s a checkpoint sponsored test comparing Physical Hardware to VMs. 
 However the second claim has me intrigued. I looked and there are really no publicly available CVEs listed for Checkpoint. With a system based so heavily on Linux and so many technical changes in the last 10 years, is it really feasible to have 0 CVEs? In my mind that is the IT version of “My shit don’t stink”. And if so, why is that platform so much more secure?
 Edit: Thanks to those who provided links. It sounds like I was right to call BS on the second claim. Much appreciated!

I&#x27;ve gone over the configs dozens of times and everything looks perfectly fine; however, the links just will not come up.
 As an afterthought, I swapped out one of the (passive)QSFP-H40G-CU3M cables with a (active)QSFP-H40G-AOC3M cable and the link comes right up. We have 8 of the passives, as that is what Cisco sent with the BOM. Is there a config I&#x27;m missing somewhere to allow the passive cables to work? Or could it be that maybe the QSFP Microcontroller on the Nexus switches can&#x27;t use the passive cables?
 The switches can see the transceivers, they just don&#x27;t initialize the port.

 Greetings!
 Im a small ISP with just a lil over a gig of traffic in some isolated island somewhere in Asia. I have a contract with our local government units and department of education on improving their internet connection. I have observed that most of my network&#x27;s traffic consists of google. About 40% to 50% google and another 40-50% facebook. Ive recently got my network its own ASN and public ipv4 ipv6. 
 Right now I have sent a request to google about it. Im just curious to know since on their website, it doesnt show any other requirements aside from having to have asn and ipv4 in RIR directory. 
 Does google require certain TRAFFIC to be able to qualify for GGC?
 THANKS!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m working on setting up an IPsec VPN connection with a 3rd party vendor and trying to figure out the best practice for configuring IPsec as either an initiator or a responder, especially when the remote peer is using DynDNS. I want to ensure that the connection is as secure and reliable as possible.
 Should I configure IPsec as an initiator or a responder? Are there any factors that I should consider when making this decision? What are some best practices that I should follow when configuring IPsec for this type of scenario?
 Any tips or advice on this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hi Everyone!! 
 Looking for some advice on how best I can continue my learning as well as whether I made a good choice: 
 I work as an IT Net Admin for an ISP. I have decided to take a job working for a federal contractor due to the pay increase and benefits for my family. 
 The job that I ended up taking is pretty much help desk stuff at a healthcare facility. 
 The trouble I think about is whether I made a choice that puts me back a few steps or if I&#x27;ve made a good choice. 
 Background:
 My current job as a net admin is pretty wtf imo. It was all good at first with my previous boss. Like I stayed within the confines of my JD but he left and now instead of being the net admin to all 3 separate departments, I&#x27;m stuck messing around trying to help 1. 
 Firstly, my boss doesn&#x27;t know anything about Wi-Fi, networking and network devices. He does know voice stuff I guess? (supposedly. He basically relies on support to give him all the answers and then says it like he knew all along). 
 Secondly, I am technically supposed to resolve networking issues for the IT department as a whole, clients and most installs as well as build networks for projects but I&#x27;m too busy trying to run around and be the manager my boss isn&#x27;t for 1 group that I wasn&#x27;t even supposed to pay this much attention to. 
 Thirdly, I am honestly running around trying to be a dude in construction and find ways to get an install done for clients without having the company spend on contractors to do that work professionally. It&#x27;s the weirdest thing ever. 
 Lastly, My JD explicitly stated I&#x27;m only supposed to be resolving network issues and build our large projects and when I bring this up I get the &quot;I know. Thank you. You&#x27;re really doing amazing.&quot; 
 There&#x27;s more to the story but I&#x27;m really trying to not rattle on.

                              <span>I have been working in networking for more then 10 years now and I wanted to update my cv (resume). 
 But I find it hard to find the right level of detail regarding network technical knowledge. E.g. if I mention I’m CCNP, do I still need to mention I know L2 protocols like rstp etc?
 How far do you guys go with typing out all the protocols and skills you have ?

                              <span>Good news, we have a greenfield lab with new hardware so this is a chance to design from ground up.
 I&#x27;m deploying Bare metal Kubernetes cluster(s) in a shared network infrastructure. The clusters will run legacy VMs via Kubevirt (virtualization project for K8s). There will also be container &quot;workloads&quot; that are &quot;cloud-native&quot;, but my concern here is the VMs.
 From what I&#x27;ve read, L3 is the way to go, bringing the L3 down all the way to TOR or even the server. Everything is routed, small L2 domains.
 As an example, the K8s networking plugin is Calico. This is a pure L3. Given a cluster-wide IP pool of 10.20.0.0/16, it carves out a smaller subnet (like a /26 by default) and assigns it to each node. Each node is on a different /26 block, and traffic is routed by the node east-west. Outbound …</span>

 I have been told that some devices do not support the use of dhcpv6 and need slaac My question is can slaac and dhcpv6 coexist is same network segment ? I prefer to use dhcpv6 for more control but what if I configure it and client does not support it ?

                              <span>Hi! Happy weekend!
 I am looking for some career advice and was thinking this would be a good place to ask.
 I’m currently a network admin, and I focus heavily on config/management of Firewalls and anything behind them for our many customers (MSP).I switched from the Voice side in the same company to the data side about 6 months ago.
 I’ve asked for raises etc, and have not been able to get past $50,000 (In Indiana, with company for 2 years)
 I enjoy and am good at SIP, and was sent a job offer as a Voice Engineer for a large provider expanding into the US, for alittle over 70% more pay.
 To me, that’s life changing money.
 However, even though i feel underpaid, i think the amount of security knowledge i gain week after week is really valuable, and i always hear people talk about trying to break into security, and it seems like i have luckily been able to do so. 
 This new role sparks my interest very much bc i do enjoy voice, but I’m worried about leaving the security space and possibly making it harder to return after my VoIP arc 
 Thanks in advance for any advice!
 Tl;Dr 
 Currently feel underpaid in network security 
 I like voice and got an offer for 70% more as a voice engineer for a large company 
 Worried about it being hard to get back into security after i do VoIP for a couple years

 I&#x27;ve tried TP Link&#x27;s EAP660, while it does have VLAN, they aren&#x27;t dynamic. It&#x27;s just one VLAN per SSID. The user logs in via radius, but has the regular IP address of the SSID&#x27;s VLAN.
 I&#x27;ve looked into UDM Pro but dislike their ecosystem. I do not need cloud management and their firmware doesn&#x27;t work well if it&#x27;s locally managed (lots of required reboots).
 Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;m a one man IT guy for a small business and would like to replace a file server that is used by about 20 users and currently has about 500gb of files and an MS Access DB. I would just like some advice/recommendations about the below config. 
 Edit: It would need to run Windows Server for AD and GPOs. The CPU was selected for the potential of a VM or two.
 Selected Configuration From Dell 
 Model: Dell T150
 CPU: Intel® Xeon® E-2378 2.6GHz, 16M Cache, 8C/16T, Turbo (65W), 3200 MT/s
 RAM: 16GB UDIMM, 3200MT/s, ECC
 HDD: 1TB 7.2K RPM SATA Entry 3.5in x2 in RAID1 for the OS
 OS: Windows Server 2022 Standard
 I would upgrade the OEM RAM with a 2x16gb kit of Crucial Memory since Dell’s memory prices are crazy
 https://www.amazon.ca/Crucial-2x16GB-Desktop-Memory-CT2K16G4DFRA32A/dp/B08C4LXXCJ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_15?crid&#x3D;2AODYT3GKVL8D&amp;keywords&#x3D;32%2Bgb%2Budimm&amp;qid&#x3D;1676687994&amp;sprefix&#x3D;32%2Bgb%2Bud%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr&#x3D;8-15&amp;th&#x3D;1
 For main file storage I would add two WD Red 10tb drives in RAID1
 https://www.amazon.ca/Red-10TB-Internal-Hard-Drive/dp/B084F34HZ6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?crid&#x3D;22QYI0B4E6ZMG&amp;keywords&#x3D;10tb%2Bhard%2Bdrive&amp;qid&#x3D;1676687392&amp;sprefix&#x3D;10tb%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;th&#x3D;1

                              <span>I have years of field experience running drops, working in racks etc. All side jobs because my primary job is as a Firefighter for a small local city. Recently, they told me I could replace a short drop or contract it out. Great... after 14 yrs we have a new IT director who is fine with non critical drops being ran with a klein scout 3 and not certified. Wrong. We got a call back that it must be certified.
 What is the cheapest tool I can use to print out a cable certification. 
 Kind you, we have fiber running into switches with cat5 ( NOT CAT5E ) runs. I digress, I&#x27;d honestly rather do this myself than contract it out. Because it opens possibilities of me doing work and upgrading our fire stations since our it contracts all of that work out.

                              <span>Sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit. I am asking because I saw a few UKG posts here before in searches. 
 My multi state grocery store company has used Kronos for a long time now. My new store manager started using UKG to create weekly schedules. So our schedules went from two pages to around eight a week. I am supposed to be able to us UKG Dimensions and see my Kronos punches and schedule. Well I put in the url that my company says to put in the UKG site and app. I can see my Kronos punches fine. But it randomly shows the schedule. Never the current schedule or upcoming, but it will show what it was two weeks ago sometimes. 
 What I am wondering is... Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app? I can find no UKG help board that does not require a sort of membership to even ask them. So I thought I would try here.

                              <span>All of us know how stressful and unstructured our profession can be at times.
 You may wake up in the night with anxiety over being breached, a system going down, lack of funding. You might cut lunches short or remove them altogether to stay on top of your work, or stay after hours to finish projects.
 Ask yourselves, how many sales people, general managers, executives, HR workers, etc are approaching their jobs in this manner?
 Remain calm and embrace a little bit of apathy. You must embrace a little apathy in order to succeed in this industry. 
 There is no perfectly secure network or organization. Downtime happens, things break, and it takes time to fix. Users can wait.
 Give your users longer than anticipated expectations. You can fix this in a day? Tell them it may be a week. Someone …</span>

                              <span>I felt really bad and felt sick and completely lost my appetite yesterday. 
 So it was very simple task. User was not receiving an email from certain email address(it is a distribution list address) in their outlook. So I wanted to forward the email coming to that email address to user&#x27;s email address. 
 To do this we have to change the mailbox in OWA to the distribution list address and set forwarding settings to user&#x27;s email. But some reason my brain lagged and I forwarded user&#x27;s email to that address. The user called me next day saying that there are no emails /receiving email in their outlook client/OWA. I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. 
 So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back. Now I am waiting for user response and depending on their response I might lose my job. I had a panic attack and still thinking about it. How I could do such a simple mistake. I am doing help desk for 1year and never felt like this. I am not sure If we can share this here. I just wanted to share it to someone.

                              <span>We have a Zoom conference room where all of the outer walls are not fishable because it was a dumb preexisting design. One is an exterior building wall which has continuous windows and the others are continuous glass panels.
 We would like something that can update via wifi to show if the room is in use or not but which does not require constant recharging like the usual scheduler iPads and tablets do.
 Even the union electrical and AV guys who helped us configure the space did not have a great cost effective solution. So I wanted to see if one of you had found a good workaround for this already so we don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel for no good reason.

                              <span>Two years ago I posted about failing Windows 10 machines failing updates Unfortunately and frustratingly, we are still seeing this problem in our environment. If anything, it seems like the issue has gotten worse. The only fix that helps temporarily for most systems is to push a in place upgrade task sequence via SCCM. This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We&#x27;ve since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We&#x27;re still using WSU, but we don&#x27;t believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them. In place repair will fix them but only temporarily. Anybody else deal with similar issues? It&#x27;s frustrating to deal with in an environment where 100% patch compliance is expected.

                              <span>What’s your top advice to someone starting a new sysadmin role?
 What should my 30/60/90 day objectives be?
 How should I “manage“ my manager eg. if there’s no structured 90 day on-boarding process, how do I create one? My experience at past roles has been varied, usually am told to read documentation, check the backlog &amp; review the ticketing system to get familiar with common issues. I feel like there’s a better way to set myself up for success.
 I have the natural instinct to want to “fix everything“ and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don’t want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I’m aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don’t want the pain of change, so it‘s never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what’s next before getting in the weeds.
 I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly. But I don’t want to set an expectation that I will work late because I need work/life balance to be physically &amp; mentally healthy. Is it a bad look to go home on time when you’ve just started a new role.
  
Thank you for the advice!

 Is this normal? Is it some kind of Agile thing? 
 Time we used to spend simply getting work done is now spent sitting in meetings with dozens of people most of whom have no stake in topic.
 Honestly feels like people are trying to cover for their lack of expertise.

 My Experience:
 I worked for a couple small MSP&#x27;s and it was absolutely horrible. At the time I was just happy to be getting experience but looking back, these were very sketchy workplaces. One place the owner bullied you and verbally abused you. The other underpaid everyone, hired family members to &quot;work&quot; for them (pretty sure this was being done in order to evade paying higher income taxes), lied about giving raises for completing certifications…</span>

                              <span>I am aware that I work so that I can afford my basic living - house, food, health. Relaxation after the 40-hour work week, only to do it for 45 years until retirement. every year.
 However, when I am on my deathbed, and I am about to die, my purpose will be for nothing. For me to survive, that life is gone. And the rich just got richer. nothing else will have benefited from what I have done, and this life seems complete wasted.
 How do you live a purposeful life after contributing to not much. What do you do outside of work that gives fulfillment. Especially that our existence is of nature, and we sit behind computer screens all day.

 Edit: Thank you for the comments, even the harshly-undertoned ones. Listening to what I don&#x27;t know, or what I am not aware of fully.

 They are printing a total of roughly 30k pages per months.
 I didn&#x27;t have a single call regarding printer issues. 
 Not once. Never. 
 I used to hate printers. Now I just don&#x27;t really care, it&#x27;s a non-problem. My painful days with HP are over. 
 Thank you Ricoh.

                              <span>I will try to make this explanation short. My company uses an old Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) that uses Java as part of its components. It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.
 I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings&gt;default browser&quot; allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
 ​
 Thanks!

 Navigate to the license renewal by phone, bring about 30 minutes of your time and maybe a cup of tee and call the US Hotline ((001) 888 571-2048).

 Based on responses and testing, this is the fix that has worked 100% of the time so far for us. Logging out of the effected user and logging back in as a different user and running this script renames the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy folder and when you log back in as the user it recreates the folder and seems to fix the issue.

 Hope this helps!

The toaster is appearing to ask for delay install or apply immediately. If the user is doing nothing then the task is delay. How making it install if the user does nothing.
 Even if my catalog and drivers are locally on the computer, DCU seems still looking for Dell.com. In the repository, I have the XML and the cab and I am using the cab as the sources. Should I remove the xml? Soing something else?

                              <span>I push out a selection of Powershell scripts that a number of scheduled tasks rely on, or have an alias to make things easier for staff (like fixvpn). 
 Today we&#x27;ve made changes to our VPN, so we need to rename the Service name in our fixvpn script, and therefore need to update the fixvpn.ps1 file.
 However, the only way I can get Group Policy to actually roll out the updated file is to set the Action to &quot;Replace&quot;. This isn&#x27;t ideal as it means that every time a computer runs gpupdate/logs in, it will download that file, and the &quot;Apply once, do not reapply&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t seem to work with &quot;Replace&quot;. I also have no idea how long a computer can go for without being booted up/signed in, so it&#x27;s less of an &#x27;enable and forget&#x27; thing.
 I even tried resaving the file under a different name temporarily, deleting the old file, and uploading the new file with the correct name, in case it was leaning on some kind of file ID or creation date, but still, the script remains unupdated.
 Am I really supposed to run this under &quot;Replace&quot; and have files copied over from SYSVOL every 90 mins?

                              <span>We have a user who’s dog vommited on their open laptop and it’s no longer functional. We’re preparing a replacement but how would you manage the “destroyed” laptop? 
 The drive is encrypted but we usually do a wipe before tossing a drive on the junk pile. 
 Would you even have this user return the laptop? How would handle it if you did?

 What the hell? is there a way to make this more usuable?

                              <span>So the issue is Outlook Desktop having no connection to Exchange, and displaying an error when trying to Send/Recieve Folder and displaying the &quot;Sign in/Fix&quot; button in File-&gt;Office-Account. Mails are neither sent nor recieved. First user reported it on Monday, it was solved with 2 reboots, other user was solved with creating a new profile after the Outlook repair kicked in. But we also have two users where the local Office programs straight up do not work anymore. Word, Excel display the Yellow Warn symbol top right next to the profile pic. Also displaying the &quot;Account Problem log in again&quot; and when you click on it, the MS login/MFA windows appears with &quot;Please wait&quot; and closes. Sign-In protocols in Azure for the affected users are all successful. Even tried the Outlook repair thingy, which created a new profile, but after that we were not able to add the users account to Outlook. It just fails. For Excel and Word, when you try to open a File from SharePoint in the Desktop App, you get an access-denied error, when you say open it Excel/Word online no problem. According to MS support try to close all Office programs, delete all saved Windows Login Credentials regarding Office and OneDrive. But the affected users only have OneDrive creds stored, as I have both, so maybe this is a step torwards a solution.The Web &quot;Variants&quot; work without a problem for the affected ones, so it&#x27;s a viable workaround atm.
 Infos: O365, Exchange Online, Hybrid Azure AD
 Maybe someone has the solution or some hint.Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Just curious as I&#x27;m trying to, slowly, learn to use Wireshark properly. Some years ago I stayed in a big chain hotel in London next to the British Library. Bored in my room I did a network scan of the free WIFI they provided. To my horror I could see everyone else&#x27;s device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).
 This time I&#x27;m on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I&#x27;m connected to check my on ship account shouldn&#x27;t hurt. But noticed loads of MDNS entries at all the other guests devices. All their device names. Surely this shouldn&#x27;t be visible if they had WIFI isolation on?
 Isn&#x27;t this a slight security issue or am I making something of nothing because I&#x27;m just not understanding the Wireshark trace?

 My org is about to implement a new to us ticketing system (ServiceNow). As part of that, we proposed rebuilding our monitoring environment from scratch in order to remove as much of our decade of customization as possible, as it has built-in integration with ServiceNow.
 We are currently using Solarwinds SAM and NPM to monitor our environment - Windows, RHEL, AIX, vCenter &amp; ESX, Nutanix AHV, and Cisco/F5/CheckPoint/PaloAlto networking equipment (along with a few random other manufacturer devices we&#x27;re monitoring via SNMP); including some items on AWS and Azure.
 The rest of my team has suggested we explore other monitoring solutions that can handle monitoring all of the above items. Part of this drive is because we&#x27;re paying 455k for our annual support/license renewal …</span>

 So far what I&#x27;ll be doing includes -

video and server data backups (local and Azure)
  
*Microsoft licence management for users
 *Security door card management 
 *Learning medical software so I could assist doctors, nurses and reception with software problems
 *general help desk support
 *local server maintenance
 *printer troubleshooting and cartridge replacements
 *Implementing my ideas for improvement if I see some parts where we could do something better or more efficiently 
 *Creating and presenting basic IT courses for staff to get basic understanding of computer/software usage to acceptable level.
 Help me learn and thrive.

                              <span>Hi Reddit,
 I am turning to you, not necessarily for advice but maybe some of you have experienced something similar.
 Rewind two years: I am originally from the UK but moved to a central European country and in the process landed a great job. In the past two years it slowly started to dawn on me how this &quot;Great job&quot; was nothing more than a toxic, political mess with insecure management and a sense of genuine contempt to said management. Hey what&#x27;s new right?
 The issue fast forwarding to now, due to restructuring, cost cutting it means that some of us have to go. The issue that I have is while fine this happens to everyone, it seems they are cutting off the foreign workers and what makes this even better is I know why. Our contract basically states that we are freelancers, we are essentia…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking around and I&#x27;ve seen many options. The current setup is an Ubuntu LTS that we connect to using putty, but for that I have to connect using TeamViewer which doesn&#x27;t seem like the best option cause then I depend on the client being there. The thing is I&#x27;ve been thinking about installing a thin client where that device is placed but I feel like it&#x27;s too much for what I need. Just accessing a remote SSH that&#x27;s forced to be in a local network. I&#x27;ve been looking around and I&#x27;ve seen many posts about KVM but I wanted to know if there&#x27;s a better option for this.

                              <span>Can anyone see any benefit to Backing up AD on Windows Server Essentials.
 My understanding is that the reason to back up AD is to avoid USN rollback issues in the context of replication. But with only a single domain controller - is there any point? I&#x27;m assuming that in this context a system state backup will suffice?
 Any thoughts on reasons why I may want to install an agent to specifically backup AD?

But I am a Sysadmin and we rarely get appreciated so here it goes: An HOD in our company sent an appreciation email to my boss praising and thanking me for successfully completing a project and fixing some major issues. Myself and the CEO are in CC. Should I reply to the sender and thank him or should I leave it be? Serious replies only.

                              <span>Hello my fellow sysadmins,
 I wanted to pick your brains regarding a decision thatI have to take.
 I am for about 14 years a sys admin/engineer. In the last couple of years I am also a team leader and recently I was presented with the opportunity to get a managerial position as a Director of IT.
 I am struggling to make a decision on whether or not to make the jump to a dedicated management position or stay in the half tech/management I do now.
 I understand that this is something very personal and every person values different things and priorities in their lives, but I would appreciate to get the feedback of some of you that made the jump (or did not made the jump), what played role on your decision and how did this turned out.
 Thank you and have a nice day

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 So I&#x27;ve been tasked with getting Dell BIOS on a fleet of Latitude laptops up to date as soon as possible. I&#x27;ve investigated several different methods and I&#x27;ve run into problems with each of them and wondered how others do this effectively.
 We&#x27;re looking to deploy in a way which has no user input or action other than looking at the BIOS update screen for a little while which is fine - to computers which are already out in the field.
 ​
 We have:
 - BitLocker enabled on all computers
 - BIOS password enabled on all computers
 - Dell Latitude 7000 series
 ​

 Windows Update for Business
 -----------------------------
 I&#x27;ve investigated using Windows Update for Business which appears like a very good solution, as it doesn&#x27;t required dealing with BitLocker suspension, or BIOS pas…</span>

 I have to learn Azure soon or I might be useless and dead weight.. 
 Is it really that hard? Like is it basically a WebUI for Hyper-V with other bells and whistles?
 I&#x27;ll be doing some research and I guess a free trials to fuck around.. 
 Any tips and tricks to look out for? I&#x27;m pretty good with PowerShell if that makes it easier?

                              <span>Over the last few weeks I&#x27;ve had several users report to me that they have sent a load of emails throughout the day but have then discovered several hours later that they have just been sitting in their outbox and have not sent. I&#x27;ve also had one user report the reverse where a load of emails have suddenly appeared.
 I assumed connection issues but this has been with a mix of on-site and remote workers so seems less likely.
 I thought it was probably an issue with MS and so had a search online expecting to see loads of people with the same issue, however that does not seem to be the case. 
 Has anyone else noticed this recently?

                              <span>We have a Synology NAS in the office. Wondering if there is any way to authenticate using your Microsoft account to access SMB shares. There is an article related to this https://kb.synology.com/sv-se/DSM/tutorial/How_to_join_NAS_to_Azure_AD_Domain but it only seems to apply to users connecting to the DSM. We have a set up where users connect directly to the server via windows explorer or the finder in macos, but they currently have a username and password (when connecting to the server I would like for them to use their AAD account instead) Has anyone tried setting up SSO with Synology to manage permissions and such? Any good guides to follow?

                              <span>Hey everyone.
 So today was the first time in my professional life that I outright snapped.
 I got an email this morning regarding an external audit, and that the auditor requested access to specific documents within our organization, you know, standard stuff.
 In my ignorance, I thought that the user would simply share a OneDrive folder/make a team/create a Sharepoint site.... or at least call me for help... but oh no...
 I got an email stating &quot;I solved the issue, and we now have a Dropbox account with all the sensitive info publicly available, have a nice day&quot;
 I never thought I got get this angry with a user, but here we are...
 I promptly called said user, deleted the documents, deleted Dropbox (considered deleting the user from existence), create a OneDrive folder with said documents and shared it with only the auditors.
 While this was going on, the user kept saying that it was my fault that the user was forced to use Dropbox, that the user could not bother to ask me for simple stuff like this and that the user did not receive any formal IT training in all the years the user had been alive, which also was my fault.
 You can guess how my reaction to this barrage of BS went... 
 I hope you all had a better morning.

                              <span>I just read this article: https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/2017/03/virtual-machine-vcpu-and-vnuma-rightsizing-rules-of-thumb.html
 The examples at the end make it clear how I should rightsize my VMs to align with the physical host. The problem is, we have clusters with ESXi hosts with different # Cores and different # Sockets. For example, in one cluster we have a host with 6 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620), 8 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz) and 12 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz). 
 The cluster is EVC enabled with at Intel® &quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; Generation. These CPUs typically have 1-4 Cores. (4-6 Extreme, 2-8 Xeon).
 I&#x27;m a bit confused how I align my vCPUs in this example. I would assume I align with the host with the least amount of cores, so 6. Btw, we are running ESXi 7.0.3.
 Example 1: VM with 4 vCPUs
 &#x3D;&gt; VM configuration: 1 socket with 4 cores 
 Example 2: VM with 8 vCPUs
 &#x3D;&gt; VM configuration: 2 sockets with 4 cores 
 Example 3: VM with 16 vCPUs
 &#x3D;&gt; VM configuration: 4 socket with 4 cores 
 Am I getting this right?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 after 9 years in IT, I had my big upsi moment.
 I was setting up a new WSUS in an environment. It was planned to rollout monthly updates in 4 rings. Test, Auto update 1, Auto update 2, manual update. So far so good. Created the gpo and put the servers in the group.
 Well, yesterday it happened... The downloaded 02.2023 Update was downloaded the day after patchday. So far so good. Only the servers within the Test group installed it. BUT then yesterday, every server just went to the WSUS, installed the updates and rebooted automatically. Even the ones that are in the manual group.
 ​
 The thing that confuses me the most is
  
I put in a time, when the servers should NOT restart --&gt; get&#x27;s ignored
 The updates were planned to be installed at the end of this week + next week
 No matter if I put the &quot;Configure automatic update&quot; GPO to option 4 (auto download, install and reboot to schedule) or to option 3 (auto download notify for install), they&#x27;ll always immediately download and install them.
  
I have no clue what&#x27;s wrong and tried to re-create this behavior in my LAB. So far I don&#x27;t run into the same issue...
 ​
 Will have a review later today. Guess I better prepare to get a new job...

                              <span>I work at a secure prison facility and I&#x27;m looking into expanding my role and responsibilities. Atm, we have antiquated group polices setup on about 100 workstations (used by medical staff) that the county IT people refuses to fix and frequently interrupts work. I have a big meeting with every manager involved and some changes could happen due to finger pointing between us contractors and county officials. 
 Essentially my wishlist would be to have county setup a separate domain controller with no original scripts running, so I can implement what I see fit. 
 I believe all I would need access to is a server connected to countydomain2 correct? 
 I should have no issue swapping user profiles from one domain to the other. I also believe that they will still be able to access their original county controlled emails via outlook correct? 
 Am I going about this completely wrong or is there something I&#x27;m missing?

I pretty much solve a variety of issues like an MSP would except I am the only employee for 12 hours of the day handling tickets, server maintenance, end-users calling asking me to explain what the &quot;app&quot; store is etc etc.
 Anyways tonight, I had received a ticket from a Network admin for one of the companies I provide services for asking for a new server to be created and manually joined to the domain. He asked me to use an AMI (Am…</span>

                              <span>Hello guys,
 currently in our production we have a special vlan for cnc machines and a special vlan for clients in the production. Most of the machines are using SMBv1 (you cant change that, because most of them are too old) and I want to implement a SMBv1 Proxy for this.
 The clients access the machines directly over SMBv1 to their network shares to integrate or remove the production files on the machine.
 Unfortunately I dont have the real time to get in the topic so I&#x27;m searching for a company which could do that and also maintain this solution (most important part). 
 Any idea of companies which do that kind of &quot;production&quot; things?

                              <span>I’m sure the consensus here will be that we should always put a clean image on them because of all the bloatware etc… but it hasn’t always been that way. Used to be able to remove a few things, run a couple rounds of windows updates and throw on the domain and it was fine. Seems like for the last couple years we always have to reimage the laptop. If we don’t we have issues with the CPU maxing out at 100% on weird built in system processes. Anyone else see that and/or have a solution for It. It’s also weird that we don’t have to do it on the desktops we get from them.
 For reference we’re a relatively small shop and don’t have put out a ton of laptops all the time. I’d say 2-3 a month. If we didn’t have to do a full reimage, we typically install office 365, sophos AV, ninja RMM client, forticlient VPN, run a round or two of windows updates then add the computer to the domain. I also run Dell command update and remove optimizer.
 Just looking for any suggestions other than reimage them every time. I’ve built MDT servers in the past so I know that’s an option, but don’t think i do enough computers to justify the time investment yet.

Now that I am enjoying a nice 2 weeks of sick leave for stress reduction, I have time to write out a little something.
 There is a &quot;Fachkraftmangel&quot; (lack of skilled work(ers)) in Germany or at least the government thinks so. [The Germans IT guys will correctly explain that their is just a lack of good paying jobs, but we do not have to get into that discussion today] The Fachkraftmangel means that the German visa scheme is very friendly for immigrants with experience and qualfications in certain areas.

                              <span>Have a Meraki Firewall, Meraki Switch, Couldtrax Access points (OpenMesh). PoE 12 port PoE injector, patch panel leading to an access point that went offline. Bad patch cable. When I replaced the patch cable, couldtrax said it was online and couldn&#x27;t communicate. No matter how many times I disconnected the ports to shut the device off from the server closet it wouldn&#x27;t work. Had to get a 20 foot ladder and unmount and reseat the cable there. Magically it started working.
 ​
 THE BIG QUESTION
 When I have something that happens with a cable with one of these access points, do I need to go directly to the access point and reseat it?
 ​
 Notes: Monitoring it before, it was in and out with connectivity, and I think this was primarily because of the patch cable.
 I didn&#x27;t test the wire run from the server closet to the AP. Did a constant ping with no issues, and thus far, it&#x27;s been consistent with the other 2 AP&#x27;s.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 (wire goes from access point to patch panel, from patch panel to PoE port on on injector, then injector port goes to switch).

                              <span>Every single time I try to upgrade the code on these (AP250s/Atoms) via the cloud based HiveManager (now Extreme Cloud IQ) I run into failures. It&#x27;s hit or miss. The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.
 Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. 
 To troubleshoot, I&#x27;ve consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they&#x27;re rebooting and won&#x27;t have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.
 These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive&#x27;s Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.
 Is extreme/aerohive&#x27;s cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy. I&#x27;m actually very impressed with the flexibility and features these things provide. But upgrading them takes half a day or more... and it clenches my butt every time.
 Thanks for reading, and thanks for any insight anyone may provide.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m stuck on this problem. I&#x27;m using the Software SynergyCP which is a baremetal provisioning software. It has a DHCP/TFTP server it uses for installing the OS.
 For some reason, I can&#x27;t seem to it to work while on a VLAN. If I take it off the vlan it does (sometimes) boot into the OS installer. I&#x27;m still learning Junos but I figured this would be an easy thing to get going. I was wrong.
 There is also a SRX550 that is the main router for the uplink.
 Here is the SRX config.

 I am somewhat the sole operator of a virtual production LED studio. I&#x27;ve been tasked with a lot of tech that I do understand and some I don&#x27;t mostly related to server networking &amp; ability to send data wirelessly. 
 We will start with the wireless data:
 I have a tracking system called Mosys. It is run on an intel nuc (rehoused with custom software). It feeds data back to one of our network switches via ethernet- which we then send to the server that processes the data. Since this is mounted on a camera, there are a lot of benefits of wireless transmission. While it is a pc (running a flavor of linux) I wanted to know my options for running wireless signal from this pc to our ethernet switch. The pc has usb ports which already support mouse/usb. It also has an ethernet…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been setting up networking (internet and cameras) for a small hotel and restaurant in the Caribbean for the past 3 years. They started off small (just 1 building) but they keep growing. They own about a whole acre of land where they keep building small &quot;bungalows&quot; and container rooms. Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street. The &quot;street&quot; is unpaved, and the other property is 84 feet from the office where I keep the modem and router. I&#x27;m leaning toward using Cat 6 or fiber to span this distance. My business partner wants to use a Ubiquity air max bridge. I haven&#x27;t set one of these up, so I don&#x27;t know how reliable or complicated they are. Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP&#x27;s. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. 
 The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time. I don&#x27;t live down there so if theres a problem, I have to call and walk someone (usually with very little IT experience) through how to reset a device or trouble shoot. I need reliability.
 I do want to future proof this. If you bury conduit, how deep do you normally go and what diameter do you use? Would you use fiber, Cat 6 cable or a wireless bridge? I really appreciate any help you can offer.

                              <span>What is a good microsegmentation tool for east west traffic?
 We use acls on our core switches primarily (Cisco nexus environment) and some acls on the distribution switches and I’m sure using a microsegmentation tool would be much better in terms of ease of use, visibility and security as well.
 Upon doing some research I came across guardicore and saw a few videos on YouTube and it looks good but I have no idea since I haven’t used it.
 Is it a good tool and what tools does everyone else use and can you recommend some good ones?

                              <span>Good day, I&#x27;d like to start off by saying while my background is in networking(studied in college circa 2008-2010) I have beginner level knowledge at best and after college I never put in the effort to keep up with the trade.
 Please bear with me as my ineptitude may show. For history, most of my professional career has been in enduser support. Recently a colleague of mine left and encouraged me to apply for his old position as a network specialist.
 I took the time to relearn what i could and played in a simulated environment and did i ever learn the hard way how different real hardware vs simulation can be. Anyhow, to the question. During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:
 Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they&#x27;d leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out &quot;command rejected&quot; I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I&#x27;m just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.
 EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage

                              <span>Hey Ya&#x27;ll,
 I&#x27;m deploying DOT1X EAP-TLS port authentication with a fallback guest VLAN on Cisco Catalyst C3850 switches used for access to offices and shared workspaces. I&#x27;ve followed the Cisco guides and have the proof of concept system working.... mostly. I am running into an issue with DHCP after assignment to the guest VLAN. When authentication fails or times out the port is assigned to the guest VLAN. However the Windows DHCP service times out and self assigns an AIPA address before the DOT1X authentication failure/timeout occurs. The Windows machine will then sit on the Guest VLAN without an IP address for approximately 5 minutes before the Windows DHCP service reattempts a DHCP request and is successful.
 The reason I&#x27;m asking this here, is that I would like to adjust my switch configs to account for this since theoretically devices getting assigned to the guest VLAN won&#x27;t be under my control to adjust Windows DHCP settings.
 Is there a best practice or recommended DOT1X auth timeout?
 The proof of concept is using this setup on the ports:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/X
 switchport mode access
 device-tracking attach-policy dot1x
 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 5
 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 5
 authentication open
 authentication port-control auto
 authentication timer reauthenticate 180
 authentication violation replace
 dot1x pae authenticator
 dot1x timeout start-period 5
 dot1x timeout held-period 1
 dot1x timeout auth-period 18

 Is anyone else seeing increased latency for anything going to and from India to Europe?
 We have no real way to prove this as we are in Canada, but ever since the Earthquakes, some of our workers in India have been complaining about latency. Its not all the ISPs that seems to be affected, but the timing is almost spot on.
 Just wondering if you are seeing something similar? 
 In most cases we are seeing a 100ms to 150ms increase from the normal.

                              <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;ve got a test environment with two Cisco 3560CGs connected together with a link agg. Each port is a 1gb port.
 ​
 Each switch has a port with the same vlan on it. At the end of each vlan is a PC with a 1gbNIC.
 ​
 When doing an iperf test between the PCs, my network monitoring software is suggesting that it is only saturating 1 link out of the two with about a gig of traffic.
 ​
 I was under the impression it would balance the load across the two? Or would this only happen if I was able to generate more than a gigworth of traffic?
 ​
 Thaks for the help!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m junior system administrator in small company and I&#x27;ve been given a task to redesign network topology since current one is quite awful. We just bought 2 Huawei 10Gb switches and 5 new servers with 4 10Gb NICs each. I&#x27;m not sure how I should set up the network core.
 I was thinking of stacking switches in master/slave configuration, then use LAG to connect my servers to the core. 4 servers&#x27; NICs bond into 1 logical NIC, and split 2/4 cables to one switch and the remaining 2/4 to the other. As I understand it, this should give me high redundancy (one whole switch can die and connection will still be ok) and high throughput (some traffic will come to main, some to secondary; total speed should be around 35-40Gb).
 ​
 Is this setup viable, am I going the right way, will it be manageable in the future?

I don’t think I can persuade my boss to buy one of those modules without having a 100% confirmation that we will be using them. A 120GB usb3.0 usb stick on the other hand would be easy to buy for us…

                              <span>Ive been in the MSP space my entire professional life. 16+ years. I’m pretty comfortable with most things, and feel mighty competent most times. 
 But.. I’ve got this client with an assortment of printers. All 5+ years old, some are Xerox Phaser, some HP LJs, they all suck. One phaser says MPC error randomly until you reboot it. One LJ has black streaks (client buys knockoff toner because apparently the legit stuff is too expensive), another LJ prints rainbow like all the cartridges leaked. One HP LJ ghosts images / print. My recommendation is to replace them, or go with MFPs that are proper and under a support contract, but the client just expects me to magically fix all these. 
 Is this a legitimate frustration, or is this something an experienced IT admin should be able to do, and do I just suck?

                              <span>Our anyconnect speed is painfully slow. 500 up/down at HQ and no matter where I try it from I&#x27;m lucky to get over 10Mbps up/down.
 Always been slow on our 5516 and expected much better speed through the new firepower but not much improvement at all.
 Full tunnel (not split tunnel).
 Expect a bit of overhead but whew not that much....

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I have always been confused with the retention policies in M365. So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. 
 If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?
 - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?
 The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.
 I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.

                              <span>Interesting problem I am having. I have looked all around to get this to work but nothing seems to stick out as wrong.
 I have two offices and 1 AD. I am trying to get the remote office to be able to communicate with the AD. I can ping the ip address of the AD from the remote office just fine. However, it will not allow me to Join the AD from the remote office.
 Any suggestions? I&#x27;m kind of out of ideas on this one. 
 EDIT: I have also changed the dns on the computer I am trying to join to the ip address of the AD.

                              <span>This is such a dumb question but how do people manage a bunch of users, servers, and computers within a building or given area?
 I manage at max, maybe 50 computers and 25 servers actively and it gets hard sometimes. I use a mix of AnyDesk for personal machines, Mesh Central, and traditional RDP for more business related systems. 
 Sometimes ensuring systems are up to date, secured, deployed correctly, configured with up to date information, etc gets really difficult, I wanna know how y&#x27;all do it. 
 I have deployed some servers that run by themselves pretty okay; they provide the services they need too and do it well. They auto update, and I automated some of the trivial tasks. But some machines, I feel like I can&#x27;t leave alone or else they will become problematic. I want to know how y&#x27;all manage these kinds of systems or manage a fleet in general. 
 I don&#x27;t even have 100 machines and it seems to be overwhelming at times.

                              <span>Been seeing a few posts lately about being burnt out or having mental problems. As a person who has depression and ADHD I know the feeling all too well. But I am here to tell you that your job isn’t as important as your life is. Take a day off (or longer if needed) if your feeling down, take a break or two during work and get away from your desk. And please, talk to someone about how your feeling. Weather it’s a psychiatrist, your primary dr, or even a loved one, don’t keep your feelings bottled up. 
 You can get through this and things will get better.

                              <span>Just a heads-up: Contrary to chatter on the Internet and Microsoft&#x27;s own patch notes, I have now confirmed the Secure Boot problem caused by KB5022842 (the February 2023 update for Windows Server 2022) also affects installations other than on VMware.
 I have two machines that are running Server 2022 on bare metal, and that are now refusing to boot due to Secure Boot failure. Other machines appear to be unaffected. The two in question boot after Secure Boot is disabled. Both happen to be older desktop-class computers used for software testing purposes, but I wouldn&#x27;t put money on this problem only affecting non-server class hardware. (HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Mini, Lenovo M93p Tiny; confirmed that both have the latest firmware available.)
 As others have noted, the problem only shows itself on the second reboot after KB5022842 is installed.
 Be careful! I&#x27;d be willing to bet that this problem affects a lot more machines than is currently being reported. Might be worth pre-emptive testing to ensure a panic doesn&#x27;t ensue if Server 2022 machines need to be restarted in the course of business before this problem is fixed.

                              <span>Back in the early 2010s when was but a young Sysadmin I went to an architecture office with roughly a dozen users, one switch, Linksys router\wifi (you know... normal stuff) and We were upgrading them to a POE switch, IP phones, business grade router, new PCs, monitors, the whole network in a box sales job. Everything was pretty normal until I noticed everyone was watching me as I entered &quot;Bobs office&quot; just to see my reaction. 
 Bob was a special kind of hoarder. Bob liked his paper. Blueprints, White plotter blueprints, Legal sized paper, A4 for some reason, and normal Printer paper. You would think this is normal... and you would be wrong. Bob had this paper from print jobs EVERYWHERE. My words cannot easily describe what I mean by EVERYWHERE. The entire floor.... white paper. Every surface in the office, paper with an avalanche of paper drifting down to the floor... His chair HAD PAPER IN IT with some weird blueprint rolls off the back of the chair making a backrest. I have no idea if his desk was wood or metal because all I saw was paper avalanching off of the 2 sides of the desk not against the wall all the way down to the floor. His monitors were sat on mounds of paper and I had to remove the paper FROM ONTOP OF HIS KEYBOARD!!! Mentally picture fresh powder on a mountain ready for skiing, but replace the snow with paper, this was his entire office, floor to nearly celling. The door would not close because of the 3+ inches of paper on the floor. A normal box of printer paper is 5,000 sheets. His office easily had 500,000 sheets of paper in it, and that may be a conservative estimate because I am over here doing math on how much volume that many sheets of paper would be, and its still not enough. 
 When I left the office I played it cool and asked when their last inspection from the Fire Marshall was, the Office Managers face got red and she mumbled something about having &quot;Bob pick up after himself&quot;.

                              <span>I am extremely interested in automating some tedious manual tasks I preform on a monthly basis.
 I know a little bit of powershell (I know a little python too) and I have been attempting some test scripts working up towards my actual automation project.
 I&#x27;m open to delving into Python or Powershell if any of you experienced automaters think I will have a much easier time of things with one or the other.
 Now this is a windows environment (If powershell didn&#x27;t make that obvious lol) and I am running into all sorts of permissions and security issues.
 ​
 The eventual goal is to have a script (When does a script turn into a program lol) that can go out to multiple PCs on my network, check the version of an application against the version I specify, and then run an .exe if the version is previous.
 So obviously a program roaming around the network launching executables is not something Windows appreciates.
 ​
 I&#x27;m just playing in a test environment at the moment, but I&#x27;m starting to have doubts about how anything I ever write would be able to be ran in prod due to security factors.
 ​
 Am I missing something here? I do NOT come from a coding background, I&#x27;m more of a Windows/Networking generalist. I feel like learning to automate is a really good step in my career so I want to push myself to learn this. I think there might be a few concepts I&#x27;m missing that would make this &quot;click&quot; for me.

 Thank you for your time

We highly recommend enabling number matching in the near term for improved sign-in security. Relevant services will begin deploying these changes after May 8, 2023 and users will start to see number match in approval requests. As services deploy, some may see number match while others don&#x27;t. To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications in advance.”
 The AAD Admin portal still shows Feb. 27th though.

                              <span>About 2 years ago the company went through a ransomware attack. At that time I used to be the local domain admin for my warehouse. The attack was traced to somebody&#x27;s remote account from the head office in New York so it had nothing to do with me or my territory.
 In fact, I warned them of suspicious login attempts to our local APC unit. They ignored it and what happened, happened.
 After that I had no business wanting to be involved with the IT department anymore. I requested that you guys handle everything from New York and just leave me out of it. That is technically what they did, but the IT head said we&#x27;re going to leave you a local admin account on your own PC just in case you need it for any reason. Okay I don&#x27;t care, do what you want was my response.
 Now they&#x27;re beefing up securit…</span>

 I&#x27;m the only system administrator, only IT for an organization. Used to be part of a large IT team in the US, but a part of the company was sold off leaving me as the sole IT person responsible for everything. I was only desktop support but was left with everything to systems I had never had access to, many sites, satellite offices, with all the standard infrastructure in each and me being left at charge of everything.
 Main issue was not that, but that I was also left doing all support, this was driving me crazy, had barely time for any of the advanced tasks.

                              <span>Looking for some advice. 
 Walked into an old environment and was asked to remove an old pki infrastructure. The environment consists of a root CA and a Sub CA. The root CA doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, the VM has been deleted a long time ago and no backup is available. Root certificate is still valid for a long time
 Most of the issued certificates we&#x27;ve already revoked. The only ones left now are certificates issued to the domain controllers via the domain controller template. 
 What would be the cleanest way to remove AD CS since the root CA doesn&#x27;t exist anymore and more important what would be the impact on the domain controllers if we revoke those certificates or remove AD CS.

                              <span>Whoever designed the alerts interface at APC must really hate their boss or coworkers. The way they have it configured to make edits is absolutely horrible.
 I&#x27;m getting an alert for UPS: Bypass not in range : either frequency or voltage.
 The hex code is 0x020F
 First off, let me search by hex code and or alert name.
 Fine, I&#x27;ll click on the Bypass events. Nope, not in there. Ok, where else could it be? Not sure, let me back to the main page and click through every event category.
 Is there a way to see all events and I can just ctrl + f to search for the one I need?
 I am remote to this site and the alerts are being sent every 2 min.
 In about 5 minutes I&#x27;ll be logging into the switch and disabling the port that the APC plugs in to or just disable the email server notifications on the APC until power is restored.
 Thanks.

 WARNING - DO NOT BUY SYSTEMS WITH THIS SSD INSIDE

 Right now we have 12 of these SSD&#x27;s in place, they all have a MFG date sticker of 2019-2020 or newer

 7 OF 12 HAVE FAILED - These systems were not one bulk order, they came in different desktop and laptop models bought over the course of several months.

                              <span>I&#x27;m after a bit of clarification if I understand the sharepoint migration process correct using the SP Migration tool in 365 Admin Centre. I have the agent installed on my fileserver and can run the migration task fine and it works no issues.
 I plan to do the main migration over the weekend, then test it for a few days before doing an incremental migration of any other files changed or added over them few days. 
 In the new SP 365 migration bit how do I do incremental migration?
 Is it a case of running the same migration tasks again and it will just pickup changes, or do I need to set the &quot;migrate files modified / created&quot; setting in the task settings??

                              <span>Shit is hitting the fan at works.
 I’m a team leader with 6 reports for a 24-7 international data centre operation.
 I look after a vital platform, from hardware up to the OS and app.
 It’s very stressful and needs 24/7 support, I’m on call myself also.
 At times the stress feels unsustainable and infrastructure is always a thankless task.
 There are upcoming political changes I don’t like the sound of.
 Has anyone moved out of this kind of position into a more peaceful roll?
 I’m paid fairly well (UK) but would take a pay cut for an easier life

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins. 
 We’ve encountered a tricky situation at one of our customers and are out if ideas. The problem is the following: 
 We got Azure ADDS setup and a AVD server in the environment.
 Each day the users have to sing in to Office, Teams, Onedrive and so on which gets a bit frustrating. Since the server is just AzureAD joined and we have no way to issue hybrid functionality for SSO through an ADDS-server the users get no primary refresh token for SSO after Windows sign in.
 We’ve been investigating how we can overcome this with no luck other then installing an ADDS-server to setup Hybrid join on to hybrid join the AVD-server. We see this as an absolute last resort and would like to make this work with the current setup. 
 Have any of you encountered this issue? Any ideas how to proceed with the current setup or are we out of luck?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to find some information about the upcoming release of the new Windows LAPS, specifically if this will be included natively into Windows 10 machines or only Windows 11 and beyond.
 On the MS overview page, they state:
 &quot;Windows LAPS is supported on desktop Windows, Windows Server, and Windows Server Core. Windows LAPS is a native Windows feature on all supported SKUs. No extra steps are required to install the feature.
 As noted earlier, Windows LAPS currently is available only in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25145 and later.&quot;
 Does anyone know if Windows 10 will see this, or would this just be a MS incentive to push companies towards migrating to Windows 11?

                              <span>Currently, we are looking at refitting some of our meeting rooms. Our original set up was completed on a bit of a budget and with zero time, we have an Intel NUC mounted behind a TV with a standard Windows 10 install. We then run a Jabra speaker/mic device under the floor that pops out on top of the desk. We also have a webcam mounted ontop of the TV. 
 Joining a meeting is super simple, you enter a pin to unlock the PC, Teams is set to auto open to the calendar upon login and you just click Join on your meeting. Its basically just a standard PC plugged into a TV with an external mic/speaker and webcam.
 We are being asked to look at some teams meeting rooms, which personally I dont think is necessary because the meeting rooms themselves work fine. We are just looking to splash some cash since we have some left over come tax time.
 My main concern is, during meetings no one wants to use their work laptop to share their screen in big presentations. They just put their powerpoint on a network share and run it off the NUC, but they still like to use their personal machines to share their just for quick bits and peices like &lt;4 quick catchups. If this even possible with a Teams meeting using something like a logitech tap? Or do you HAVE to share your screen using your personal machine?

 I’m currently looking into implementing an identity platform for students K-12. I’ve received a few demos but need the truth and your best opinion.
 As of right now we use AD for our abundance of IT resources. Our only purpose of using an identity platform would be for the students, ideally.

 If you have any experience with colocation or dedicated server services in NY4 or NY5 datacenters, please let me know which companies you would recommend and why. It would be great if you could also share some details on pricing, such as monthly costs and any additional fees.
 Any help or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Has anybody ever ran into the problem that Outlook (the new client) doesn&#x27;t want to display HTML-Newsletters correctly? It&#x27;s across all our computers (Macbook Air). The &quot;old Outlook&quot; can display them correctly as well as Office 360. I feel like it&#x27;s an update which broke it all - but I couldn&#x27;t find any official bug repots on this.
 Anybody else who had this problem?

                              <span>My company is around 1000 folks, small IT team and we have everything in a colo and some in the main office. We rely on a few servers as host for VM&#x27;s and EMC unity arrays. It works for us the only thing we do cloud is wasabi for offsite backup and 0365 for email, SharePoint,one drive. 
 Long and short i had a discuss with a buddy of mine who works for a much bigger company and thinks were crazy that everything isnt in azure or aws. The cost is just to much for us. 
 ​
 Whats your cloud status ? Just wondering.

 Maybe its time you guys start pushing back on pure marketing ploys when buying stuff. They have gotten away with this shit long enough.

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I&#x27;m working for small-medium company that have had it&#x27;s IT processes really messed up before we came and implemented Azure AD, Intune, Office365 etc. Asset management in the past was just an excel spreadsheet that is not accurate anymore. This company has offices in different countries but, ultimately, the main one is in UK. What finance needs is to have a direct link between the invoice that came with the laptop or monitor for example, who has it assigned now and ultimately, they want to have to option to see the cost in GBP even if the laptop was bought in Morocco for example, using MAD as a currency. Depreciation in the app is also a must have
 ​
 Is there any web app that can do asset management with regards to this specific financial details? I was looking at BlueTally but i don&#x27;t know if it can have multiple currencies or something like that.
 ​
 Any info would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Was having trouble with a Laserjet printer (smearing on left side of the page). I think it might be the imaging drum but it still shows as 60% and I dont want to spend a ton of money without making sure what the issue is. Checked the warranty on HP&#x27;s site, still good. To get the support phone number, the page says I have to signup (red flag #1), so I ignored that, and found the number somewhere else.
 Called the local line, got the song and typical excuse that &quot;We are experiencing long queue yada yada&quot;. After picking the printers department and waiting for a while the phone system said &quot;We have a faster moving line, if you speak english, press x&quot;. Since English is not a problem, I went there.
 A lady picks up, listens to my problem and says she can&#x27;t help because they don&#x27;t deal with printers (red flag #2). Wants to give me a long phone number (unrecognizable to me) and refuses to say which country it belongs to, so how can I use it? (red flag #3)
 Realizing she has no idea where I&#x27;m calling from, I explain how I reached there, including the fact that I speak 2 languages, to which she says &quot;Wow, you&#x27;re so talented!&quot;. This is the part that I&#x27;m still laughing about.
 The whole conversation was weird, little bit condescending and silly. To me this is all kind of hilarious because I didn&#x27;t expect anything better than this when calling HP 😂

                              <span>We are noticing issues with Microsoft services on our network. I tend to notice it most when trying to sign into services using Azure sso. Sometimes it just hangs for a long time loading the page or after entering credentials. I have even seen it hang indefinitely or just timeout. Intune/Azure/365/company portal are also slow or just never loads. Most of the time if I just refresh the page it works fine the second time.
 I have seen this issue happening many different phones and computers so I know it isn&#x27;t anything device related.
 Is anyone else noticing this? I have been noticing the issue for months and it isn&#x27;t going away. Some days are better than others, but it happens pretty much every day.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have someone in my company with that problem : No process is displayed in the task manager.
 ​
 - It is possible to open the task manager
 - The &quot;show more details&quot; bottom left is enabled
 - All other sections (performance, startup, details etc.) are working correctly
 - The startup folders in ProgramData/User session folder are created
 - /sfc scannow didn&#x27;t change anything
 - When I connect with my own session, the processes are showing, so it&#x27;s definitely from the user session... 
 ​
 Any other ideas ? My final solution is to delete the user&#x27;s session and to let him create it again but he has a lot of favorites, shortcuts so this is more annoying... 
 ​
 Thanks ! :)

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I can&#x27;t figure out why some signed official binaries downloaded from internet are blocked by SmartScreen (with no possibility to force approval). For example,
 - if i download &quot;ConEmu&quot; from the official website, the binary has a valid certificate chain where the root CA is in the trusted roots of the computer. This prompts the Smartscreen. If i &quot;unblock&quot; the file from properties i can run it.
 - i download &quot;notepad++&quot; from the official website as well, valid certificate chain with trusted root. This doesn&#x27;t prompt smartscreen, directly UAC...
 Can someone explain this behavior ? I could see that the trigger of smartscreen is the &quot;zone identifier&quot; of the executable, but as told in the example, both of these were downloaded from the internet... 
 Also, how can i check the zone identifier of an executable?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Dear Community, since we get more and more home office devices, which only need to have a vpn client and connect over rds, we decided to not join these devices into our domain, since they are only used from outside our network. At first i checked them frequently manually, there are too much devices for this.
 Now i am searching for a small software, i would love to have a portal to see which devices are out of date. Priority is for windows updates and upgrades, third party software would be a bonus.
 Do you have any suggestions for me? The devices just have a connection to 4 terminal server, so the communication needs to be done over the normal internet.
 Im excited to hear about your opinions.

                              <span>Hey, I have a situation which cant figure out how to deal with it. Basicly there is a running yaml config of application and it can be modified from an API directly plus it can be configured through helm with templating. So at the deploy/upgrade of helm we have one running yaml config and yaml config from helm which may have additions and chanages to existing config. What is the best way do dynamically merge two giving precedence to running config? main point is being generic/dynamic but not going over each possible config array.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 24 year old working as the lone IT guy for a huge organization. I&#x27;ve busted my ass to please everyone for five years. The teams message notification sound rings a billion times a day and my personal phone is being called by random employees who somehow has my number. Even when i have lunch, i lock my office door yet people are trying to rip off the handle it seems like to get inside. 
 Right now i have 4 huge problems i&#x27;m trying to fix at once because they&#x27;re all urgent last call things they need by the end of the week. One with fiber infrastructure, one with a cisco switch being unstable, one with Vmware and one with a WDS Server. They&#x27;re all problems that requires a somewhat lenghty amount of troubleshooting and configuration. 
 I&#x27;m trying my best but these people constantly send me passive aggressive messages asking when it&#x27;s done and why it&#x27;s not working. I&#x27;m trying my fucking best and i just want to scream. I&#x27;m currently so fucking overloaded by anxiety i just shut down and i&#x27;m now in the server room to just get a moment of peace. I still feel my phone vibrate and my heart jumps everytime it does. 
 Please remove this if it&#x27;s not within the rules to post, but i just needed someone to vent to. I have a job interview next week and that job has ZERO user support. So i hope i can get away from this shithole ASAP.

                              <span>I manage about 250 retail stores and use the following products:
  
PRTG - For monitoring WAN uptime, typical Windows sensors, etc.
 Cradlepoint - For LTE backup Internet 
 Rubrik - Data protection of Azure and M365 workloads
 Proofpoint - Email security
 Intune - MDM for corporate devices
 Microsoft Defender - EDR
 Zendesk - Ticketing
 ForitManager/Analyser - Central manage of Fortigate stacks of each location
  
All of these products provide API&#x27;s that I should be able to grab data from and display on a dashboard.
 My goal is to create PowerBI Dashboards for the data points I want to display from the list of products above. I want to be able to visual these dashboards from my mobile via the PowerBi app as well as setting up wallboards in our IT area of the office.
 Is this realistically achievable, all from PowerBI? My issue is that I have never successfully been able to display a single piece of data via a API. I have tried, but always fail.
 Are there other that have similar IT dashboards setups as I described?

                              <span>I manage a small tenant of around 50 users, and only very recently I had the urge to create AUs to split up the management actions across other admins. Being a sole administrator for long, didn&#x27;t feel the necessity to create an AU. 
 Are you (O365 Admins) use AU from long back or use any other tools to overcome the situation to delegate resources to multiple admins. Is there any other better approach to delegate role to other users?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am trying to make a decision based on the fact that i am so over tech support right now
 I am currently a junior sysadmin with experience in PowerShell scripting and very basic programming knowledge in website development. Lately, I have been contemplating a career move to become a software developer. I am looking for advice on whether this move is worth it and what skills or experience I should have to make it happen.
 I have enjoyed my time as a sysadmin, but I am looking for a career that is more fulfilling and flexible. My main goal is to start a business one day as soon as possible, and I am wondering which career path will be more advantageous in this regard. I am starting to enjoy building things, and I am concerned that being a sysadmin will mostly be a tech support role until I get into management. I also can&#x27;t see how any sysadmin skills will help in business/side hustles until it gets bit enough to need storage and automation. Whereas i feel like building small apps and implementations is possible to do on the side at least if i was to understand development
 I was considering doing a 6 – 10 month bootcamp to help transition, but am also considering other options. What are the key differences between being a sysadmin and a software developer? And most importantly, which career path will be more beneficial for starting a business or work for myself in the future, sysadmin/devops route or software development?
 Lastly, holding me back from making this move is that I have recently landed a role as a lone systems admin and have okay money now (90k AUD) and am enjoying 20% of the work (building/scripting things) and the title. Does it get much better? I am worried about losing the stability and the title of my current role, but I also know that sys admin skills aren’t really transferable to many starting out businesses and side hustles.
 I appreciate any advice or insight. Thank you!

 I’m going with Python scripting (the possibilities are endless and extend way beyond sysadmin work), Azure (less specific and for unsurprising reasons), and the ability to fix any printer issue in 15 minutes or less (or maybe just to convince people that they don’t really need a printer anymore?).

 The SU&#x27;s look to be set to supersede the actual CU within SCCM.

                              <span>Here are the facts of the situation:
  
We are an MSP with a central office that has a backup appliance.
 
Our customers&#x27; servers send data backups to this appliance daily. 
 
Our office and all customers have static IP public IPv4 addresses.
 
Data comes in on TCP 35116 and 35117 which is port forwarded to our backup appliance (see below before you gasp :)
 
 Here is what we do to secure this
  
The office firewall drops all inbound traffic on 35116 and 35117 (actually all ports) unless it is coming from a customer IP address. We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses
 
Backup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key
 
The connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance
 
The backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance
 
The backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else
 
  
Here is the debate.
 A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.
 What do you think? Is adding a site-to-site VPN (with appropriate firewall rules and controls) to this setup worthwhile?

                              <span>Perhaps someone has seen this before, when I enable the following on the switch stack consisting of two Cisco 9300s, the second switch cannot handle the config sync and reboots itself, showing the error in the log that this is causing the sync issue.
 archive

 maximum 14

 I assume this is due to the path, can the standby switch write to flash? or can it not handle the $h variable? I want to set up local config change logging and backups at the very least, because the network team for this org has let it all go to hell, and now I have to fix everything and do it myself, hell they didn&#x27;t even set up SNMP properly, all the network devices are using RADIUS servers half way around the world away when we have some locally... just a mess.
 Any advise on maybe setting up better management of the local devices is welcome as well, maybe there is an open source solution I can run locally to at least manage the configs?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been in the field for a while now and I&#x27;m shifting from networking more into security.
 I&#x27;ve been working with FTDs as well as Checkpoints and Palos for a few years and everywhere I look (especially this sub lol), I can see frequent jokes about the FTD platform.
 I mean, I kinda get it, the platform didn&#x27;t start out well and was a hot mess until recently when they managed to catch up a bit in my eyes. But when I read the discussions, it seems to me that everybody thinks it&#x27;s a completely wasteful investment to any deployment.
 So what do you guys think? Is it still that bad as everyone says?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if anybody has any real world experience with this combination of devices. We&#x27;re in the process of upgrading from our old 5508 controllers (and 2700/2800 series APs) to a pair of 9800-L WLCs with 9115 APs. Nothing new is in production yet, we&#x27;re still in the planning phase, and we&#x27;re trying to figure out how difficult this will be (we&#x27;re in a manufacturing environment where some sites work 3 shifts and almost never shut down).
 According to this compatibility matrix, it should work. Here&#x27;s a screenshot of the relevant section.
 I&#x27;ve got one of the 9800s online and I&#x27;ve got a spare 2702 AP that I&#x27;m testing with. I&#x27;ve installed 17.3.4c to the WLC installed the specific AP firmware from the table but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get them to talk. This very well could be user error so far since I&#x27;m not that familiar with this thing yet.
 I&#x27;m just wondering if anybody can confirm these work together. This would be much easier if we could just swap out the controllers with the existing APs in place and then swap out the APs one by one (we&#x27;ve got the controllers but the APs aren&#x27;t due to ship for several months yet). Otherwise this will get convoluted quickly.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been facing an issue on a new box where I seem to be unable to communicate with interfaces that are in a management vrf. I haven&#x27;t run into this on any other device so I&#x27;m a bit confused. From what I can tell everything appears like it should work, but I can&#x27;t get the networks connected to &quot;CORE-DEVICE&quot; to talk to Loopback1 on &quot;DEVICE-A&quot;. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve been tinkering with this for too long and am lacking ideas.
  
The interface I&#x27;m trying to access is a loopback interface - 10.10.1.50.
 I&#x27;m using OSPF to sync ldp. 
 I see the correct routes and next hop at both ends. 
 I am using two route reflectors. 
 A traceroute from the primary device(CORE-DEVICE)/location is successful to the first PE(10.10.253.2/10.32.0.0) - then fails after that.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been fighting with this for a few days and am wondering if anyone else has a Dell N3048P using TACACS to hit Clearpass. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything searching around on forums or on Aruba/Dell support pages. I believe the issue is with my Dell&#x27;s AAA configuration. I&#x27;ve tried several variations but nothing has seemed to get past CPPM to hit the Access Tracker. I have services built out for Cisco, Aruba, and Brocade with no issues. 
 CPPM is showing a &quot;warn&quot; in the event viewer for a failed TacacsServer request. &quot;Authorization request for unauthenticated user &#x3D; blahblahblah&quot;. The device is added to CPPM and a device group. I changed the secret in CPPM and then started receiving an error about the secret having a mismatch so that isn&#x27;t an issue.
 Dell AAA config:
 aaa authentication login &quot;defaultList&quot; enable local tacacs
 aaa authentication login &quot;tacacs&quot; enable local tacacs
 aaa accounting commands &quot;dfltCmdList&quot; start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands &quot;1&quot; start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands &quot;15&quot; start-stop tacacs
 aaa authorization exec &quot;dfltExecAuthList&quot; local tacacs
 ​
 I&#x27;m mainly curious if anyone has this setup on their network and might have an easy answer for me. I&#x27;m about to call Aruba TAC but I doubt they are going to do anything since the issue seems to be with Dell which we no longer have support on.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I&#x27;m currently trying to figure out my best path forwards with a Firewall migration.
 Diagram
 (Default routes marked by arrows)
 At present no dynamic routing is in use (yes I know). The Legacy Firewall has routes back to the Legacy L3, the Legacy L3 has routes back to the new L3.
 The intent was to use PBR on the new L3 so that subnets could be moved from using the Legacy L3 as their default gateway one at a time, so that the associated VIPs and rules on the Legacy Firewall could be moved individually rather than in one large cut-over migration.

                              <span>With BGP, is there a way for my router to receive a /30 route from one peer but ONLY distribute it as a /31 to another peer?
 Long story short, I&#x27;m distributing routes with a peer from another company but I&#x27;m unable to use AS paths to reliably determine upstream route preferences. The only way I&#x27;ve found is to subnet sizes to determine the preferred path, but I&#x27;m currently limited to advertising /31 routes that peer. Since the other company is massive, it takes a lot of effort and paperwork for them to make changes, I&#x27;d rather do this on our end if possible.
 Is there a way for my router to receive a /30 route from my network but ONLY distribute it as a /31?

 how much down time it can occur if I change a default route from one gateway to another?
 Example below.
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.1.1
 to 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.20.1.1

                              <span>Hi,
 Not sure if this exists yet, but can we create an International BGP community standard or something along those lines for advertising your prefixes so we know what Country/State/Province/Region/etc your prefixes are located?
 We operate a latency sensitive network and have to constantly filter certain prefixes from being learnt via certain AS&#x27; so they have optimal routing and it is a tedious task. 
 This is where I had the idea that surely there had to be a better way and the first thing that came to my head is BGP communities that will identify the Country/State/Province/Region/etc. For example, an ASN with the 123.123.123.0/24 prefix in Japan Hokkaido Region can have a BGP community of 11:1 announced with their prefix. 11 being the Country (Japan) and 1 being the Hokkaido Region. (Side note: I really hope we end up giving Japan 11 as their BGP community code as a *tips fedora* to Code Geass).
 I&#x27;ll admit this is not fully thought through yet and I wanted to open up the discussion to the networking community to hear their thoughts. The first issue I can forsee is AS&#x27; that strip BGP communities. In my head this International BGP community standard would be most useful in IXs.
 TLDR; If you operate an ASN can you advertise your prefixes with a BGP community that will identify the Country:/State/Province/Region/etc? An International BGP community codes standard for the BGP communities would be great.

                              <span>Is there any way we can all agree on one thing? The name Networking. When you are trying to setup a group of people to meet with that you call it something other than &#x27;{var} networking group&#x27; and go with &#x27;tcp/ip group&#x27; or some other term. I can&#x27;t tell you how many &#x27;networking&#x27; groups I&#x27;ve almost joined but come to find out it&#x27;s just businesses trying to &#x27;network people&#x27; or have like minded marketing people get together. So can we all pick a new name? I know we&#x27;ll are all 99% hermits and never leave the dungeon..but for those of us who like to venture out.....

                              <span>I want to create a captive portal with different restriction per user account/role (student and teacher). 
  
The Teacher can have unrestricted access.
 The Student have restricted access. (only defined/allowed websites are accessible).
  
But upon my research/review on OpnSense Captive Portal Documentation, This is not possible because you can only configure firewall/captive portal settings per port/interface. In short, 1 Zone is 1 Interface.
 I cannot modify the infrastructure/wiring or add another Wi-Fi access points since It&#x27;s already installed and running. I can only configure them.
 So my plan is: 
  
Setup 2 VLAN ID&#x27;s (Interface) on a single physical ethernet port on OpnSense that is connected to the Wifi Access Points.
 Create two Captive Portals on OpnSense that uses the 2 VLAN Interface I created.
 Configure the Wifi Access Points to two SSID&#x27;s (Teacher Wifi &amp; Student WiFi) and attach each SSID to specific VLAN ID I setup on OpnSense.
 Configure OpnSense Website Filtering on the Student Wifi VLAN Interface.
  
To be honest, these are just my theories. I don&#x27;t really know if this is a feasible or good workaround/setup. This is my first time in network setup/engineering. Please bear with me.
 All I want to know is, Is this kind of setup possible Please give me some tips/suggestions on how I can do it better. Thank you very much!

I was able to access the asdm via default route 192.168.45.1 but I changed the firewall mode to transparent and a lot of configurations were lost. I changed my firewall mode back to routed and reconfigured all the missing files but I cannot access the asdm anymore. I tried configuring the management 1/1 but no luck. 
 What happens when you change the firewall mode?

                              <span>I have a remote site that is connected to my DC via a Juniper SRX firewall that&#x27;s establishing a site-to-site tunnel to another SRX in the DC. The remote site is on a cable internet circuit. At all my sites, including the remote site, 802.1X with EAP-TLS is used for both wireless and wired auth. This has been working great for months, until my ISP changed which backbone on their network my DIA connection runs across. No other changes were made anywhere other than the provider&#x27;s backbone that&#x27;s delivering the DIA circuit.
 The IP address of the SRX in the DC didn&#x27;t change and the tunnel is still up and working. I can&#x27;t find any evidence of issues with the tunnel, except .1X doesn&#x27;t work anymore. On the NPS servers in the DC, event viewer shows that auth requests are coming in from the switch and AP at the remote site, but it almost seems like the .1X requests are getting mangled across the site-to-site tunnel. The same NPS servers service .1X for hardwired and wireless clients across several other sites connected via the ISP&#x27;s MPLS without issue.
 Event viewer shows that auth requests from the AP at the remote site get logged as event id 6274 &quot;The RADIUS Request message that Network Policy Server received from the network access server was malformed.&quot; Auth requests from hardwired ports from the remote switch show that rather than the computer name with a certificate, the request shows the client trying to auth with its mac address as the username and PAP and summarily denied.
 A tech at the ISP that made the backbone change and I have been beating our heads against the wall for a few days now with no progress. I&#x27;ve resorted to installing wireshark on the NPS server to try to find differences between known-good auth packets and broken packets, but haven&#x27;t found an obvious difference yet. Would anyone happen to know how a seemingly innocuous change could bork .1X in such a bizarre way?

                              <span>I have set up the equipment stated in the title as a failover solution. it works, HOWEVER, it still has about a 30 second delay, and re-assigns me a new IP somewhere that im not smart enough to know about. For example, if i was on a video call, i would have a backup internet connection within 10-20 seconds, EXCEPT i would have to re-start the call. its not seamless.
 I&#x27;m not sure where the new IP is getting assigned and where to fix it. I found on google lots of stuff about setting up a &quot;floating IP address&quot; that would duplicate the information from the old IP and send it to the new address thats coming from the 4G LM1200.
 Any assistance? Thanks.

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking to get a 20G MPLS circuit for a site in Asia. Our preferred carrier can meet this requirement and the pricing is fine, but it was mentioned that their backbone serving this particular country is basically a heap of 10G links.
 We often have to send huge files internationally, which can easily saturate a 20G circuit. Should I be worried that the carrier&#x27;s backbone is Nx10G? Would something like traffic arriving out of order due to asymmetric routing be a potential issue?
 What kind of questions should I be asking them before we pull the trigger? I have full access to their network engineering team but I&#x27;m finding it hard to articulate my questions so that I don&#x27;t receive bullshit answers.

                              <span>Greetings,
 Does anyone happen to have old Nortel Optera manuals / management software hiding in their personal archives? 
 I have a network history lab that I am trying to bootstrap and I am needing to activate some Optera gear (5100 in particular).
 I worked with the Optera platforms in the early days but I cannot locate my PDFs or software archives for them.
 I know that Optera IP went to Ciena - but I had moved out of optical by that point - so I don&#x27;t have a relationship with them.
 I am hoping that being many years out of date - some of this would be available without too much fuss. 
 This is a completely non-commercial exercise - just trying to restore some items from my past as a hobby (I have the hardware, just no software/docs).
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello Im trying to config a Untangle firewall for using OpenVpn access internal server port 8081.
 When client connects using OpenVpn the OpenVpn conection says its reaching to the outside Untangle firewall IP with port 1194 without any errors. 
 Then when the client opens their application an error comes up with the IP:8081/Server which is the server,port,share that is open for that application.
 I dont know if this is correct but I made a Port Foward rule form OpenVpn port 1194 to forward to the internalIP:8081 (ServerApplication)
 Am I configuring this correctly or how do I go about it? Thank you!

                              <span>I cant seem to get this network configuration working.
 Two routers are on the same network. 
 (site to site VPN to another RV325) WAN &gt; RV325 &gt; (LAN 192.168.15.1) 
 (OpenVPN) WAN &gt; RV260 &gt; (LAN 192.168.15.2) 
 DHCP is disabled on both. Running a DHCP server on a 2016 DC.
 ​
 I just added 192.168.15.2 to the scope of the DHCP just now hoping that will fix it.
 ​
 When I log into the OpenVPN RV260, I can&#x27;t see anything on the network, why?
 The RV260 and RV325 are not compatible for site-to-site VPN, otherwise I would do it and remove the RV325 completely and this problem will go away. Howeverm I can&#x27;t do that, so there has to be a fix for this. 
 ​
 Why when I log into the OpenVPN server on the RV260, I can&#x27;t see any network devices? I can only ping devices with the Gateway of the router I am connected too. 
 ​
 This is bothering the crap out of me. 
 ​
 Please help.

 I am a developer, so I do not have much knowledge in networking or datacenters.
 My application requires multiple IP addresses, currently I rent some on premise servers, and using docker container my microservices work each one with their own IP address.
 I want to buy my own IP addresses so I don&#x27;t depend on the availability of my current provider, but I do not know where to start.
 - Do I need a local server?
 - Can I just purchase a pool of IP addresses and use them with any cloud provider?
 ​
 I would appreciate any help from you guys, hope you have a nice day

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 Im hoping someone might be able to help me figure out an issue I am having configuring a Cisco switch.
 ​
 So, first, I am not Cisco certified and overall have very little experience configuring Cisco switches. 
 ​
 The issue that I am running into is kind of strange. I am not able to get to my firewall from one of my VLANS.
 ​
 My test environment is like this
 ​
 ​
 Switch 1 (core switch) 192.168.0.10
 Switch 2 (access switch) 192.168.0.11
 Switch 3 (access switch) 192.168.0.12
 Firewall 192.168.0.6
 ​
 PC1 192.168.0.100
 PC2 192.168.0.110
 PC3 192.168.3.110
 ​
 I can ping everything from both PC1, PC2 and the Core switch. 
 I can ping both PC1 and PC2 and the core switch from PC3, however, I cannot ping both access switches and the firewall from PC3.
 ​
 I have an SVI configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 on VLAN 30 on my Core switch. 
 I have a computer plugged directly into port 4 on the Core switch, but I cannot ping firewall. 
 ​
 I have been reading article after article and I know I have to be missing something stupid here. 
 ​
 I thought maybe it was because I didn&#x27;t have layer 3 enabled, so as a test, I even configured port 4 with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and enabled routing, but I still get the exact same results.
 ​
 I have a static route setup for 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 to forward traffic to 192.168.0.6 (firewall).
 I am able to get out to the internet from both PC1 and PC2 just fine, just not PC3.
 ​
 Furthermore, if I log into my switches web portal, I can switch to VLAN30 and I can ping out directly from the switch, but I still cannot ping either access switch or the firewall from the Core switch on VLAN30
 ​
 ​
 Any help would be so very gratefully appreciated. 
 Thank you so much in advance!
 Edit: Solved!

 I&#x27;m currently tasked with deploying a modest data center, and I&#x27;m looking for some recommendations on software to create network rack diagrams that include cabling and airflow.
 I&#x27;d like to create professional-looking diagrams that accurately reflect the constraints of our data center, and I&#x27;m hoping to get some input from the community on the best tools for the job. Whether you&#x27;re a seasoned pro or just starting out in the field, I&#x27;d love to hear what software you use and why you prefer it.
 Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions!

                              <span>Last week I posted this thread, titled &quot;Microsoft taps FS for campus switches after Dell fails to deliver.&quot;
 In that post, I included an email sent to me from my account manager at FS. A few of the people in that thread brought up the idea that FS may not have had permission to reveal the skype(?) chatlog between them and the purchaser. For example;

They won&#x27;t be working with Microsoft for long if their account managers are treating the deal as a non-consensual marketing exercise. That email if it circled back to legal would blow up the deal and possibly get them sued where I work.
  
– Newdles commented:
  
Yeah, expect Microsoft to kill this deal now. There are Microsoft employees here. Whoever sent this email should also be fired for terrible privacy practices.…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am wondering if anyone can give me any suggestions here. I have traffic coming into let&#x27;s say VLAN10, hitting a firewall (I see this being passed), exiting via VLAN20, hitting the VLAN interface on ACI, and then not hitting the actual gateway of the destination subnet. 
 In a working traceroute I see: VLAN10 &gt;&gt; Firewall (static route out) &gt;&gt; ACI VLAN20 Interface &gt;&gt; Dest. Subnet Gateway &gt;&gt; Destination IP.
 Not working: VLAN10 &gt;&gt; Firewall (static route out) &gt;&gt; ACI VLAN20 Interface &gt;&gt; Timeout 
 Does anyone have any suggestions as to what can I check here? I am not very familiar with ACI. (The source is the same core router, different l3 vlans all taking the same path).

 My boss told me to check the fortinet training/certification system, to start more in depth work with some client&#x27;s firewalls. 
 I&#x27;ve researching about it in their website, but is a bit confusing. So if someone who has more experience with i, could help me aswering some questions would be great. 
 1- Do I need to complete NSE 1-3 to do 4-6? Or any other above?
 2- I&#x27;m from Portugal, and I can&#x27;t find where to do the certification, if it is online or presencial in some partner.
 3 - The Courses in the differents levels, give general technical concepts in addition to the tools from the fortinet catalog? 
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>We currently control our L3 in our at&amp;t’s avpn offering. We have gre (mGRE) tunnels and bgp feeding various services via afi to various sites. Some sites even have various other types of encryption. From my understanding, typically the site rtr does NOT have MPLS config, though we still have MPLS qos config on each site rtr, along with the hub having MPLS qos config. Our hub feeds into another MPLS network we own - after collectors - so I’d presume, if the marking is kept, that it could be used for our campus MPLS qos (I think that’s the teams thought here). However, peeling back the onion, it was revealed to me by AT&amp;T, that each site doesnt necessarily have a COS profile ordered with them , which would explain some of the asymmetrical issues seen while traffic went through AVPN - maybe. My question is, if we are hopping around at layer 3 already, would MPLS markings still be seen or matter by AT&amp;Ts underlay somewhere? Even with just the basic GRE traffic, I’d figure that qos markings would be copied over maintained? Right now, I think the profile not being set as being the problem / waste.
 At a higher level to this, it seems like there’s a possibility that whoever architected the design so that we control L3, traded off the QoS perk gained from MPLS. Hopefully not.

 Problem: Running out of DHCP addresses
 Current setup with /23 is 192.168.0.0/23 for static IP addresses and 192.168.1.0/23 is for DHCP. We are looking into VLANS to help alleviate our available IP issue, but as a quick fix to more immediately alleviate this issue.. Could we go to /22 and can we specify the next subnet? i.e. could we do 192.168.21.0/22 or does it have to be 192.168.3.0/22 (do the subnets need to increase incrementally or can they be manually defined)?
 We don&#x27;t want to use subnet 3 because we have a site in our WAN that currently uses 192.168.3.0/24

 Any ideas why the traffic is visible in Wireshark but not in netstat/TCP?
 Any recommendations on what I could try doing?

                              <span>Hello Networking Gurus! 
 I had some recent network speed issues so I pulled out my trusty iperf3 to try and diagnose and I found something I am hoping you can help me with. I have a server in my office and other in my basement, about 75 feet of cable run between them. When I run iperf3 as the server on my basement linux (fedora) server and the client on my laptop I see lots (200,000+) of retr (retransmits). But when I do the reverse where the iperf3 server is in my office and the client is in the basement, I get few to no retr. This is very consistent, lots of retr going in one direction (office to basement) but few going the other way (basement to office). I have also run iperf3 server and client both on servers in my basement using the same switch as basement to office and that’s also pretty clean, few if any retr. 
 Does this point to a bad cable? Bad switch? Bad ends on the cables? What would you do to diagnose and clear this up?
 Thanks in advance for your wisdom and guidance!

                              <span>All flights from Lufthansa world wide is staying on the ground. Because of a single point of failure.
 Late yesterday afternoon, a drill cut four fiber optic cables from Deutsche Telekom during third-party construction work on a rail line in Frankfurt. As a result, Lufthansa is also experiencing IT problems.
 Two cables have already been repaired overnight by our technical team and many customers are already back online. We are continuing to work at high pressure on the repairs. The situation is improving continuously.
 Europes biggest carrier, shouldnt they have a backup / ha in place?

 I do not know anything about, the fiber Company, there might be the only cables delivering internet in that area, but seems like this could be avoided?

                              <span>Hello, first time posting here, i hope i do post on the right flair. 
 So, i have a TP Link EC230-G1 that my friend gave to me, and it worked perfectly, except it wont give internet access to IPV6, while IPV4 does give internet, while it doesnt matter much to me but it kinda bothers me. Initially i tought this might be a DHCP conflict, so i assigned a slight difference of IPV6 address (like it ended with 9F i change it with 8F) to my Router (set as static ipv6 address), it does change, but then it would still not work, im at a loss of any solution here. My main GPON Router is Huawei HG8245H5.
 I really hope there is a solution to this problem :D

                              <span>For traffic separation purposes (customer vs company internal) I need to have two dynamic routing processes that do not exchange routes with each other.
 The routing devices will only be part of one dynamic routing process each. However they share a central subnet so they will see all routing packages that go over that network.
 My first idea was OSPF but I don&#x27;t know if I can have two completely disjunct areas. EIGRP is not an option as there are non-Cisco devices involved. 
 Any idea what would be my best option here?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 currently facing issue with Huawei routers regarding netconf. I need to configure netconf on huawei devices, however i find that documentation on this subject is very limited and i couldn&#x27;t find any usefull information.
 ​
 I have an AR2200 router with firmware version from 2020 (V200R010), and according to this document, netconf should be somehow available on this device but i&#x27;m just not able to configure it in any way, nor am i able to connect to it with the netconf protocol (using -p 830 or -s netconf).
 ​
 Is anyone familiar with Huawei devices in general, or does anyone know what devices support netconf and how to configure it?
 ​
 Thanks for any help, i&#x27;m really clueless at this point :-(

                              <span>Can&#x27;t find an answer to this as every example has a 1:1 mapping.
 ​
 Consider a L3 leaf switch with 2 trunk ports. They serve different tenants I want to keep isolated. Eth1 connects to a baremetal server owned by A, Eth2 connects to a bare metal server owned by tenant B.
 Furthermore, each tenant wants to create their own self-service isolated networks for their VMs/Docker containers. Or they could just go and configure a vanilla Linux VLAN interface on their box to send their own VLAN tagged traffic on an arbitrary subnet. I don&#x27;t want to restrict this...
 Now normally I&#x27;d say A gets X vlans, B gets Y vlans, these are your subnets. But there aren&#x27;t enough VLANs to go by, also, I don&#x27;t want to restrict it to one server... I want the same L2 domain no matter which rack or switch the server…</span>

                              <span>For the vbond, vmanage and vsmart, we do a certificate signing request, send it off to the CA server and the CA server gives a ID cert. This is to be done for each of the controllers.
 On the videos I am watching, the same is not done for the vedge devices. Only the root cert is copied into the vedge and installed. 
 My question is, do the vedges need a ID cert? And if so, how does it get generated?
 If we don’t need a ID cert, then what’s the purpose of the root cert in the vedge?

                              <span>Hey all. Happy after valentines day. I&#x27;ve got a problem eating at me. And yes I realize I should leave the shit at work. But. 
 I have engagement (tehe) with a vendor on a project recently. They provide SaaS for my company. We are trying to stand up a new site to site. Problem is we don&#x27;t see the tunnel (policy based) come up. My next steps were to do an embedded pcap as I am not seeing any traffic from the host at the firewall. I send an email to the vendor saying I see no traffic each time we test... but then after I explicitly point at the host in one of my emails we see an icmp request come across the fw about an hour later. Following I get an email from their pm asking me to explain steps I see in the network and they are requesting an additional resource to look at our network. 
 Now the question. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is indeed ego related, but my ego isnt that big (is it?). 
 Previously when setting up the site to site, I worked with a respectable sounding network engineer. Would it be wrong to reach out to him and ask him what the hell? (Respectfully.) The problem is that the traffic never leaves the host. We have routes out and they proved it via ping. 
 TLDR: I want to hear about times that you all took back alleys to get things accomplished. Or do we all just play the follow along and provide pcap when requested?

                              <span>In Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, R2D2 can be seen plugging in to download additional plans to the Death Star. One sees R2D2 in the screen for approximately 80 seconds before we see him again in frame, disconnected from the terminal. I contend R2D2’s dongle is capable of yottabit speed.
 The hard drive used to store the plans allegedly held 512 million exanodes of space, as depicted in Star Wars Rogue One. This would therefore be 512 yotta nodes if one follows the metric naming convention for numerical prefixes.
 General (poor) assumptions: (1) R2D2 spent all 80 seconds downloading the plans to the Death Star (2) the plans to the Death Star and its build history downloaded filled up the drive (3) a bit is equivalent to a node (4) no q-bit fuckery is afoot and (5) the plans are uncompressed.
 512/80 is 6.4 yottabit/second throughput.

I used PDQ in past but having so many users remote and being agent-less it&#x27;s not working half of the time. How you go about 3rd party updates, or even Windows updates. Thanks

                              <span>Within the last couple of days I had setup a DFS Namespace on a domain controller and DFS Replication to replicate a shared folder from one file server to another. During the course of that initial replication copy, there was a root folder on the same drive where the shared folder was being replicated to and that root folder is now gone. Backups were not in production at the time as the server was still being configured. Replication only went one direction (Old Server to New Server) for one folder and its sub folders (IE D:\SharedFolder\FolderShares1-6 and User Redirected Folders). this was done as a form of migration of the file servers. 
 Now that the folder is gone, I am wondering why would DFS remove that folder if it was not part of the replication. I am also now running into issues where users are denied access to their User Redirected Folders, which still reside on the old File server and are managed via GPO.

                              <span>I work at a retirement facility. I got off a call today with our ISP (A very well known massive cable/internet/phone provider, but not comcast) where they casually mentioned (after we threatened to go in house) that we must use their managed Wi-Fi MDU solution, they wont just give us an internet pipe for us to do it in-house. 
 They said the Business or Enterprise divisions will not give us a connection for residential use and if they see that we&#x27;re trying to use it for our residents they will cut us off.
 There&#x27;s literally no other ISP that services the area except for T1 DSL or Starlink business. 
 Does this make any sense? They&#x27;re essentially forcing us to use their managed service which we hate and want to get rid of. 
 How can this be legal? What about all those news stories of some people in neighborhoods becoming their own ISP by buying a business class modem and then re-selling it with some kind of mesh system to the neighbors?

                              <span>I took over as the head of IT and part of the role is vendor management, which includes the MSP currently being leveraged for support and professional services. In fairness they’re the second MSP and took over last year from another MSP.
 There’s been a few red flags (100s of dormant AD accounts, Azure servers running but not used for anything, etc) all minor things I could chalk up to unintentional or old MSP shenanigans. One frustration mentioned when I started is the migration from the previous MSP is only now being wrapped up by the new MSP, a year later. All these things I again can chalk up to scheduling, waiting for resources, etc. 
 What I do need a sanity check on is the slowness of response for requests of 1) documentation and network diagrams, 2) quotes for new projects, and 3) a lack of interest in consolidating/disabling portions of Azure infrastructure.
 For example, I requested a rough estimate for five projects 8 business days ago. By no means detailed SoWs, just a rough number for budget setting. Or waited nearly three weeks for documentation and still no response beyond confirmation of receipt.
 Is this type of non-responsiveness expected? What is considered a quick turn-around for these types of requests? Feel like I’m going crazy.

                              <span>Greetings fellow sysadmins,
 Our organization relies heavily on Microsoft Word VBA Macros to generate and live-edit Word documents. They were hand-made about 15 years ago, and the original authors are gone. Our sysadmins can maintain with minor edits as needed, but aren&#x27;t really tasked for making new, complex workflows should the need arise.
 In googling, I found that Microsoft released &quot;Office Scripts&quot; in 2020. By &quot;Office Scripts&quot;, Microsoft really meant, &quot;Excel Online Scripts&quot;. Have not seen any indication of scripting being extended into Word.
 Is there any successor, alternative, or replacement to Word VBA Macros? Seems kind of weird for a technology from 1993 to have no replacement 30 years later.
 Thanks for any insight you may have.

My admin is gung-ho about physically moving drops from punch to punch when certain people move to a different desk within the one building in the company, and re-punching is uncomfortable to say the least, painful normally.
 So my question is it normal to move drops to different panels so that they can be plugged into another switch? This happens a fair amount (including, &quot;condensing the drop&quot;) and I thought to ask.
 Thanks!

I appreciate the aesthetic value of darker slides, but am concerned that excessive use would cause my audience to grow disinterested or have a negative impression of the topic being discussed.
 Which is why I chose to initiate this thread in the first place.
 What kind of tactics, approaches, hacks, etc. do you employ with your slides/presentations to irk out that much greater of a reception/response to you? whether executive or not. I had someone recommend to me HighNote.io, has anyone ever used the tool before ?
 Friends, shall we share once more?

                              <span>I recently took over running a medical facility. The clinic and providers are great but every other part of the business is set up terribly. I&#x27;ve been going through it piece by piece working on fixing it. Trust me when I say my predecessor was a complete moron.
 My most recent discovery is that we are paying $865 a month (before taxes and fees) for our copy machine (only one) that only sees moderate use. It took me days and about a dozen calls and I finally got ahold of my account rep and the explanation is my predecessor continued to roll over their lease agreement about 2 years early over and over and we have been with them for 30 years so the previous amount due was also rolled over.
 The summary is that we pay almost 1,000 a month for the next 63 months (the contract was signed only a few months ago). To break it we would have to pay over $55,000 for a copier machine that would cost about $8,000 to buy.
 ​
 If anyone has any advice or experience with this kind of situation any input would help. 
 Again reminder I did not sign this contract!! This is just one of many insane contracts signed here by my moronic predecessor. I always read the fine print.

 I know I can just click to use my default browser and move on with my life, but I can’t help but wonder the confusion this will cause people who now think they have to download a new app/browser in order to view a link.

 Random Password Generator (Maybe not a very well known tool, but recommend it)

 Notepad++
 7zip
 Curious to see what others have to share.

                              <span>So one of our site has a down apc. We literally have hundreds of the replacement battery on back order and spend months replacing them because we don’t know when they will die. We have a lot of apc units but someone decided it’s not worth getting the monitoring card. So sites will go down for a day or two till the tech goes out to replace the battery. The funny thing that one tech said was 
 “They are suppose to check it monthly”
 Mind you these are office worker with high turn over. They either don’t know what to look for or did not receive proper training. Unless the apc panel changed, I don’t think it show the condition of the battery. No one knows when it’ll die. How is visually checking the panel any indication of when the battery needs to be replace

                              <span>I&#x27;ll keep it short. We have a (bad) vendor who was very late in providing Edge support. For that reason we have held off on disabling IE. Lots of testing has been done and we believed we were ready for the disabling of IE yesterday. 
 Only... it does not appear to have happened? We have applied the latest Windows security and Edge updates but IE still works. We are not running one of the unaffected versions of Windows 10. 22H2 on the Feb 14 builds with latest Edge updates can still launch IE. 
 Anyone else seeing this? I am just trying to ensure we didn&#x27;t miss something here.

                              <span>Has anyone else experienced odd login issues in various MS365 Office apps since Monday?
 We&#x27;ve had Outlook being stuck in an infinite login attempt loop until restarted (sometimes it needs two restarts), OneNote not synchronizing Notebooks and not accepting new login attempts as well as OneDrive and even my own Win11 machine requiring a new authentication after a reboot (but those just validate automatically with no password prompts, they just have to be started manually by clicking the &quot;login again&quot; prompt). But not everyone is affected and they are rarely the same issues across users.
 Just wondering if it&#x27;s just our org or if MS has changed anything behind the scenes without checking if their apps still work afterwards (again...)

                              <span>Hello there,
 I would like to setting up the SSSO to my organization but I don&#x27;t know if it secure enough. I have an hybrid environment but without Azure AD-joined devices, my devices only joined to the on-premise AD. I followed the Microsoft documentation and I configured everything: Azure AD Connect, GPO and the Firewall. It is working very well with my test users. 
 My settings in a nutshell:
 Azure AD
  
Password hash sync
  
GPO (from Microsoft documentation)
  
Site to Zone Assignment List
 Allow updates to status bar via script
 SPNEGO (Firefox)
  
AZUREADSSO Computer Object on my on-premise AD
  
Storing object in OU where is securing against accidental deletion
 msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute set to AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
 Kerberos delegation is disabled on this object 
  
According to Microsoft documentation it is recommended to update the Kerberos decryption key at least on every 30 day.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso-faq#how-can-i-roll-over-the-kerberos-decryption-key-of-the--azureadsso--computer-account-
 I have not found anything about SSSO on the internet from a security perspective. Can cybercriminals exploit this SSSO capability or is it safe enough? I am wondering about on this because SSSO sends Kerberos ticket over the internet. I don&#x27;t know if I should worry about that. Maybe I just overthinking.
 Does anyone have experience with Seamless Single Sign-On? Can you share your experience with me?
 Is there anything else I should be aware of?

                              <span>Hi r/sysadmin
 I&#x27;m curious how you all go about testing your backups? We have a medium/large sized environment with ~1000 VMs and a few physical servers (most SQL boxes) that we are backing up regularly. 98% Windows, a very select few Linux. However, we don&#x27;t have a definitive process for testing these backups beyond requested restores that we have to do as people need them.
 Previously, I used Veeam&#x27;s SureBackup feature to test backups at my previous job, but here we use Commvault and I don&#x27;t see a similar feature. There does seem to be some sort of backup validation but Commvault&#x27;s documentation doesn&#x27;t match what I&#x27;m seeing in our console.
 Using Veeam&#x27;s SureBackup as a model, I started to build out a sandbox network that would mirror our production network, which I could restore VMs into and then run scripts against them to verify they are working. The point I&#x27;m more or less stuck at is the &quot;scripts to verify they are working&quot; part. For basic Windows boxes I&#x27;ve got a script that checks for running services, and for all the VMs I&#x27;m pulling their reported heartbeat status by VMWare, but this is imperfect and doesn&#x27;t cover some of our more specialized boxes like Exchange or SQL databases. 
 Somewhere along the line I think there will be a human element (IE, you are the admin for this server, your server is currently in the sandbox network, login to it and make sure everything works before it gets torn down) but I&#x27;d like to automate as much of this process as possible.
 What approach do you take? Is there a feature in Commvault I&#x27;ve missed or a third party tool that solves the problem? Or do you have better ideas on what to check using various scripts and the like?

                              <span>EDIT: title is missing &quot; of folders&quot; in the end..
 Hi,
 I need to add an AD group to the ACL of thousands of folders, which all have different permissions and inheritance settings. All the folders are subfolders of drive D
 I need all the permissions to stay the same, just one group added with full access. I wrote a powershell script for this. 
 Is this the right approach? do you see anything wrong with this?
 $identity &#x3D; &#x27;domain\group&#x27; $rights &#x3D; &#x27;FullControl&#x27; $inheritance &#x3D; &#x27;ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit&#x27; $propagation &#x3D; &#x27;None&#x27; $type &#x3D; &#x27;Allow&#x27; $ACE &#x3D; New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule($identity, $rights, $inheritance, $propagation, $type) Get-ChildItem D: -Recurse -Directory | ForEach-Object{ $acl &#x3D; get-acl -Path $_.FullName $acl.AddAccessRule($ACE) Set-Acl -Path $_.FullName -AclObject $acl } 
 Thanks.

 Just installed the 14/02 Windows update and am getting Security Violation on boot of the two 2022 VMs I have. 
 Disabling SecureBoot does allow the VM to start, but there is something going on here....

                              <span>Hey all. 
 So I&#x27;ve been trying to think about my career in a 10-15 or maybe 15-20 year span. I know it&#x27;s a controversial idea, but I look at the developments in the space and satellite industry and can&#x27;t help but see this era as the verge of a massive breakout of space infrastructure. 
 So that got me thinking, what does an IT infrastructure look like to a space faring civilization when there are regular trips to a lunar colony? How would you deploy software to an MECM distribution point on the moon? How would you handle a Domain Controller in deep space?
 I&#x27;ve tried looking for early research on this idea without much success. Does anybody know of any reading material on the subject? Or possibly any writings on interfacing with a remote site that has unreliable or inconsistent communication times?

                              <span>Hi Guys, how do you go about designing and testing a DR plan when your core applications /services are in the cloud. Do you just explain in your DR plan that you are relying on the SAAS vendor DR plan or should we realistically have a plan if for example if google workspace was to go down? 
 The reason we go with SAAS providers is they will have 1000 times better DR than we could afford but I find we are being asked to provide a DR plan for our business and am finding it difficult to articulate this.

 So we have a hardware vpn in Colorado that has a s2s connection to azure. Usually when you are on prem and on the same network as your vpn, you should be able to access the same assets as if you connected to vpn remotely.
 It won’t let me connect to azure s2s and when trying to connect to vpn in Colorado from California.
 Is there a setting , I have to switch on and off to get access to tunnels from onsite. I feel like should be a very basic setting , and it should just let you always have access to azure subnets if your on prem

                              <span>Hey All, I have a bit of a situation, I have been upgrading Fortinet firewalls in HA for over a decade and last night was the first time I had a fail, The slave firewall upgraded but the Master did not, at present I have Master on 7.2.2 and slave on 7.2.4 (Note that the slave is now the master).
 My thinking is to remove the heart beat(HA) cables and then connect directly to the original master (on 7.2.2) and upgrade it to 7.2.4 thereafter start the boot sequence and get the firewalls back in order with HA cables. I have made no changes since last night.
 Call logged with Fortinet but they are taking forever to respond. Anyone run into a similar issue and can offer some advice?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot lately (gods save us...): How do you stay motivated/focused and interested enough to keep your skills up to date and learn new skills? What&#x27;s your tricks?
 I&#x27;ve noticed as I&#x27;ve both gotten older and have been in this field of ours for damn near 25 years, absorbing new knowledge and learning new systems/skills that I haven&#x27;t worked with before is becoming more and more difficult. I struggle maintaining enough of a focus to keep at it, and also notice that my retention is pretty abysmal. Case in point, these days I&#x27;m trying to shove a lot of MS&#x27; Power Platform-skills into my head, since I&#x27;ll be working a lot on that due to a move to Dynamics 36 that we&#x27;re currently underway on.
 But I find it damn hard to actually do, even though I&#x27;m interested in what the Power Platform can do in terms of data management and automation.

                              <span>Hey,
 Kind of odd question but I hope someone can help me understand it.. as far as I know, IGEL reworked their license model recently and I&#x27;m not sure if it still works for our planned enviroment.
 We have around 10-15 Thin Clients, mostly in warehouses where it&#x27;s rather dirty and since we swapped out most office PCs in 2021, I have a bunchload of old systems that I want to rework into TCs to replace our current &quot;infrastructure&quot; which consists mostly of 7-10 year old actual thin clients with a self-&quot;constructed&quot; Linux version. Latter one wasn&#x27;t documented at all by it&#x27;s creator who hase left us in the meantime.
 So around the middle of 2022 I got 4 IGEL licenses to test and that worked pretty fine so far, we decided for the UDP / USB-Version and had no problems occur and the remote assistence etc. helped a lot. I had to put the topic aside for a while now due to other more urgend topics and since we lack staff right now. 
 I read somewhere that IGEL reworked their license modell and it&#x27;s no longer &quot;Buy once, get 1 year of support and that&#x27;s it. More support costs but you can use the thin client without support&quot;. Considering the rather dirty enviroment and that our current &quot;Solution&quot; produces no monthly/yearly cost (except a device fails after years of usage) I doubt that I&#x27;ll get the OK for a yearly subscription model.
 So could someone break down the new system or if I understood it wrong and my planned system/setup would still work?

                              <span>Hi there,
 a customer of ours has a CNC machine with a possible malware infection. The machine is completely offline and runs on Windows XP. They transfer NC files from a domain-joined PC to the machine with an USB stick.
 We recently got an AV alert from the PCs AV solution, because it found an infected Autorun.inf on the stick. I&#x27;ve re-formatted the stick, but the issue reoccured soon after, which implies that the CNC machine is infected.
 We&#x27;d like to scan the CNC machine, but so far haven&#x27;t found a virus scanner which fits our needs: 
  
Lightweight and portable
 Usable without internet connection (with up to date virus patterns)
 Compatible with XP
  
Does anyone know a fitting software?

 What is the suggestion for centrally managing and scheduling these scripts, yet still maintaining security due to the required elevated credentials?

 Started off in support but slowly became senior. Now im the only person in the company who can deploy, support, update the majority of our applications and services. And the only person who has access and knowledge to handle the hardware/azure it all sits on.
 Ive been pushing for fair pay for about 6 years but constantly been give the typical HR spoof (you&#x27;re not worth that much, we dont have spare funding, the company isnt in the right place... ect) 
 I handed my notice in today and im leaving them no documentation or training any replacement.

 ​
 I&#x27;m writing to you because I can&#x27;t figure out this odd behavior:
 We changed the IIS server&#x27;s timeout setting from 90 seconds to 250 seconds.
 The appliance is placed on the back of an Azure LB with a 240-second timeout.
 Since the change, we have observed numerous transation timeouts where none had previously been reported.
 When the previous settings have been restored, everything was back to normal.
 Do you know why this peculiar behavior is occurring?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi sysadmins, I had quick question about logging on Windows servers. By default (i.e no SIEMs, no IDS, no firewall), how much info does a windows server log about any devices that connect to it? More specifically, is it possible for me to find which devices connected to it within a certain hour last week?
 Specifically the machine in question is a mail server running mdaemon. Someone sent an email from the organization&#x27;s account with stolen credentials. We are trying to find the IP (and any other info if possible) for whoever connected to it. If windows server logs the IPs of all incoming requests, then it should be trivial to cross reference those requests with timestamp on the email right?

                              <span>Im having weird issues with APC UPSes lately. We connect them via USB to our Servers (Windows Server with Hyper-V).
 PowerChute gives us the notification that the UPS connection is not established via our Monitoring. We have tried everything so far. Reinstalling the Software, Replugging the UPS (which sometimes works), Rebooting the OS and so on. Nothing really helps.
 ​
 I know the UPS is connected to the server. If I uninstall the APC UPS Driver, then the UPS gets detected by Windows and the battery symbol appears in the taskbar.
 ​
 Doesnt matter what Windows Server it is. The problem happens on any of our Servers. Randomly I would say. Its really frustrating because you cant seem to fix it remotely.I dont wanna go on site to check the UPSes myself. Not with 100 clients.
 ​
 Anyone else having that issue? Or maybe someone has found a fix?

                              <span>New to linux or sysadmin, and new to organizing myself and scripts and env. I am setting up aliases and bash functions for making my life easy at work. I plan to use git to save my work in a repo within a branch having a name &quot;common&quot; for common things and another branch with name of that of the company I am working for, and to which the laptop belongs, where I will save/commit company specific stuff.
 I see that I am spending a lot of my free time in customizing things. Shell variables, aliases, bash functions, writing scripts to help me login to different envs (Azure, AWS, local Servers etc) easily. Aliases to execute frequent long commands. Functions to execute commands with parameters.
 Wanted to understand, that since this is the beginning for me to customize my env for myself, is it Okay to spend a considerable amount of time in the process? I am hoping that my current way of customizing will help me in future companies also, where I can clone this repo, switch to an old companies branch, take what should be taken from common (probably all), and then create a new branch with the new company name and add that company specific stuff there.
 Will doing things this way, which would make things heavily customized in the future, and might need some maintainence overhead too, is a good idea? Or is there a better way?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m starting a new position as a CISO in a company where the IS is very complex... and partially unknown by the internal management team... (parts of the IS are externally managed)
 As I progress by interviews or self discovering, I&#x27;m looking for a tool where I could:.
  
create assets by type and tags (human, server, network, data, workflow, geographical plant, supplier ...)
 
bind them together
 
provide a visual representation for assets with dependencies and relations between them 
 
and for the GRC part, ability to add controls to some assets, based on applicable regulations (GDPR, for ex.). 
 
 Do you know some tool or combination of native tool with plugin which could achieve this ? 
 Thanks

 I have a batch script to call out where the below script is located.
 C:\&quot;Program Files (x86)&quot;\WinSCP\winscp.exe /console /script&#x3D;C:\Scripts\script2.txt /log&#x3D;&quot;C:\temp\WinSCP.log&quot;
 # Automatically abort script on errors option batch abort #Disable overwrite confirmations that conflict with the previous option confirm off # Connect using a password open sftp://user:password@ft.domain.com -hostkey&#x3D;&quot;&quot;ssh-rsa 2048 key&quot;&quot; # Change remote directory cd H:/usr/ # Force binary mode transfer option transfer binary # Download file to the local directory # This will download any .txt file and delete it from the source once the transfer is done. The file will be downloaded to \\Fileserver\Fileshare get -delete *.txt \\server\userfolder # Disconnect close # Exit WinSCP exit 
 So far I&#x27;ve been getting permissions denied errors so.

                              <span>Looking for advise how to join Cisco AP into existing mobility express. I need to join in mesh mode. To avoid Ethernet cables. All of them are powered by PoE adapter next to them. ME is running on 2x AIR-AP3802I-E-K9 where One is controller and second is wired access point(this will be ROOT for other wireless) AP that i need to deploy as wireless points of network are: 3x AIR-CAP3702E-E-K9. &amp; 3x AIR-AP2802I-E-K9. Also if possible to deploy AIR-CAP1702I-E-K9 v02 (these old devices am not sure if can be used here) 
 So 1x controller ME 3802i + 2x RAP mesh ap 3802i +2802i +5 x MAP mesh from others( these can be upgraded to 5 more)

                              <span>I have been trying to figure out the best method to test and troubleshoot this issue I&#x27;m seeing. Every day around the same time, one of our sites&#x27; (public high school) bandwidth drops to nothing for about 15 minutes. I ran iperf tests on repeat and logged the output across the WAN to the site and I was getting around 1.8Gbits/s on a 2Gbits/s connection. Right around the time the students leave the bandwidth tanked in iperf (just across the WAN to the DC) and on speedtest.net to 30Mbits/s for between 5 and 15 minutes. Seems to happen each day around that time and then just clears up.
 I have smokeping running and that looks clean and never shows a change. I don&#x27;t drop regular ping packets but if I run a faster fping I do see between 1%-4% packet loss around that time. Interfaces on my router are clear. Nothing in the logs of the routers on either side. Something tells me it&#x27;s the WAN provider but I am out of ideas on what to test or how to prove the issue further. I plan on reaching out to them tomorrow to see if they can seen anything on their side but I know that will be tough to get them to research it. Any recommendations on what else to try and test?
 TIA!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m in the process of replacing the firewalls at our main site as well as our DR site and had a question as to what the best way to setup SSL VPN connections for our users would be. The current setup is non-existent in that my predecessor never did any SSL VPN config on the DR firewall (I don&#x27;t know how they thought that was going to work in a disaster).
 Each site is going to have a pair of Palo Alto 3410s in active/passive HA. I&#x27;d like to try to avoid having to setup each user with 2 different SSL VPN configs (one for normal use and one for DR use) and the only way of doing this that comes to mind immediately would be for me to have a virtual firewall in the cloud that I use to terminate all of the client SSL VPN connections to and then have a site to site VPN between that firewall and both the production site and the DR site. With that setup, in a DR scenario I wouldn&#x27;t have to touch the SSL VPN config, just route the traffic from the virtual firewall to the DR site rather than the main site. Obviously this would require extra licensing for the virtual firewall and increases complexity but I&#x27;m thinking it might be worth it to not have to setup every user with multiple SSL VPN configs and explain to them to use the DR one in a DR scenario.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience with SSL VPN configs on Palo Alto firewalls yet, so if there is an easier or more efficient way to achieve this please feel free to suggest. Thanks.

When I wanted to mark it as configured wrong, I used ping and tracert from one network (PC to PC) to another, not directly configured router, and it worked ping got through. Can somebody explain why can be IP address of network used as next hop or is it just Pkt bug?
 I have never heard that IP address of network can be used as next hop.
 Static from router:
 ip classless
 ip route 195.13.188.0 255.255.255.128 195.13.191.238

                              <span>Full disclosure, I am not a PM so I am struggling to know what to do to move to the next phase according to PMO practices. Here is the story and I&#x27;m hoping you fine folks can point me in the right direction. Have put our Firewall on the FY 23&#x27; replacement radar so I&#x27;ve seen demo&#x27;s from a few vendors on their product, all vendors had our requirements beforehand on what I am looking for in a FW. We are not married to the big &#x27;C&#x27; so I have ventured out to the competition and for the most part I have liked Fortinet and Checkpoint. I have invited all engineers in my department who have worked with our current FW and may administer the next solution (disappointingly they rarely showed up to the the Demo&#x27;s). So now that I have spoken with the vendors of interest whats next? Do I make a decision based on what I&#x27;ve seen? Do I gather the team and ask, &quot;Okay who should be continue to speak with in the next phase&quot;. We can&#x27;t take demo&#x27;s because I work for a Govt agency and its a against company policy, but I want to make the best decision possible that will benefit the organization. Can someone help me understand where I go from here?

 Then i reboot location B ADC, but after the reboot i can not see server cert files. In nsconfig/ssl i ve all cer and key files. In GUI i can successfully bind key and cer files. But copied ns.conf write like that,
 &quot;add ssl certKey abc.cert -cert abcd.cer -key abcd.key dhsaohdosadsajdıoas(like encryped key) -encrypted -encryptmethod ENCMTHD_3-kek-suffix 2023_01_26_11_14_06&quot;

                              <span>Dear networking pros at reddit...
 I have a grown /24 network I have to manage at our company because our networking colleague left the company...
 All adresses are used and therefore some colleagues get no ip address at all - as expected. 
 Now I don&#x27;t really know how to professionally create a solution. First approach was to create a new /22 network but I read something about problems due to the Broadcast overhead with this many clients in a Single subnet.
 Currently I consider a multi-subnet network for our lan and wifi. But I simply don&#x27;t know how to design this to avoid any problems in the future. 
 LAN ports can be assigned to the subnet, maybe one /24 per floor.
 My question is: How do I setup our wifi in the building? We currently have one SSID and I would like to keep this. How do I split this up? Same SSID with different subnets?
 Thank you for your input!

                              <span>We&#x27;re deploying Opengears around the US and global for OOB. This will be major cities primarily but you never know (one of our datacenters is in the boonies of NJ, for example).
 I think the answer here is a global-roaming multi-carrier SIM. One vendor, all networks, don&#x27;t have to pay attention to where we ship it. Ideally it lets us also choose whatever carrier has best signal instead of being locked to the carrier we bought the sim from.
 I was looking at Twiliio, and the platform is just super cool, but we&#x27;re not large enough for them to be interested in giving us a better rate. So I&#x27;m looking around for other choices. If twilio is the only choice then I&#x27;ll hold my nose and pay, but it&#x27;s worth asking what else there is. 
 Let&#x27;s figure a burn of around 15MB/day so around 500MB/unit/mo. Not huge, not zero. Bogey being here occasionally we may want to use it for backup IP for the site, in which case we&#x27;ll be burning 10s of GBs. But maybe that&#x27;s ok in the case since it will be an emergency. (We normally run dual ISPs for offices but not everywhere has decent alternatives etc.)
 No, I don&#x27;t expect it to be free, I just also don&#x27;t want to get bent over, so to speak.
 Who else plays in this space that is worth talking to?

                              <span>We have 2 SonicWALLs one in the US and one in Asia with a site to site VPN to each other for a call center. 
 The call center voice router and server is behind the US sonicwall. 
 Users in Asia also have a per user L2TP VPN for wfh days.
 Here’s the issue: When Asia users are at the office (hence using the site to site VPN in Asia) they experience call drops and crazy packet loss on the calls.
 We know this because the voice router/server monitors the calls.
 When Asia users are at the office and turn on their L2TP VPN to call, the calls are perfect with less than 10% packet loss. 
 Why would users experience better call quality using an L2TP vpn behind the sonicwall rather than just the site to site? It’s also all the same equipment too (wfh vs office)
 I’ve tried MTR and trace routes but since I can’t see the route behind the VPN i haven’t been able to pin point the issue.

                              <span>Hello, Actually working as a network engineer (6y of experience), I feel anxious and depressed almost all the time because idk what to do anymore. Traditional networking is about to disappear, what to do next? Learn SDN? Cybersecurity? Cloud techs? Learning is not the problem, how to practice is the issue for me, if I don’t practice it’s kind of useless to just read, i switched back to field engineering from presales because i cant just read to understand and have the concepts memorized If you’ve been there? What did you do ?
 Thank you

 We all know that Palo Alto is more expensive than Fortinet, but I need to put concrete numbers to it. &#x27;Not just purchase price, but typical AV/IPS updates. Thanks.

                              <span>So I get called into redoing a network for an SMB. They just bought this business and their server is ancient and failing. All they need is a file server so we decided to switch them to a structured p2p network. Our &quot;server&quot; is 32 GB Ram, 2 1TB hard drives that mirror every night. Everything looks great, except they have 2 VDI thin clients machines. Is there any way to get them to work in a P2P network? They didn&#x27;t give me information on them whenever we discussed the job; I&#x27;ll be honest, VDI is not in my wheelhouse. Any tips would be GREATLY appreciated.

                              <span>I recently got complaints from two different customers regarding lags in Microsoft Teams meetings, when multiple users on the network join the meeting individually.
 As far as I understand this, Teams is working like this:
 - Call between two people on the same network: Media traffic goes P2P
 - Call between two people not on the same network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 - Call between multiple persons inside and outside the network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 The last scenario is where they experience the problems – especially, when the number of internal people in the meeting is high, as every Teams client seems to up- and download all the media traffic.
 Have you experienced the same? Is there anything you can do about it? How do really large companies handle it, when they have like hundreds of people joining a Teams meeting for trainings of stuff like that?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 ​
 I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s easy for me to understand the core concepts of MPLS than MTU...
 Yes, by &quot;MTU&quot; I still mean Maximum Transmission Unit. I have read all these blogs, watched all these videos explaining MTU and its problems, but still here I am and ask for your help. 
 Let&#x27;s say we have some simple topology: 
 Switch-A - Router - Switch-B 
 Switches are just L2 switches, all routing happens on the router (which is actually L3 switch). Assume that all switches have 48 access ports and support Jumbo frames. Some servers and clients are connected to these access switches in a random way. 
 Okay, now I want to enable Jumbo frames on my network because some (only some!) servers require this. I did it on all ports between network equipment, so there is no MTU mismatch on the network core. Now, let&#x27;s say I enabled Jumbo frames support on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports. So we have:
  
Jumbo frames are enabled on all links between network devices.
 Jumbo frames are enabled on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports.
 All other access ports and devices connected to these ports have default MTU.
 
 My questions are:
  
What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to a server with 9000+ MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to the server with 9000+ MTU if: Client and Server are in the different subnets?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the different subnets?
  
Thanks.

 Our customer wants us to do live analysis on traffic going into their virtual data center our customer has hosted by the cloud provider data center think (AWS) .
 We want to plug our physical router somewhere in the physical cloud provider data center and get all the traffic going in, out and around the virtual data center to make sure its secure in the physical data center .

 Career wisdom for sysadmins, compliments of HouseCravenRaw: 
  
Irreplaceable is unpromotable
 Documentation is king
 Know your exits (rollback plan, etc.)
 Always get a CYA
 Toot your own horn—modesty doesn&#x27;t make money
 ‘No’ is a complete sentence
 Stability is paramount—don&#x27;t aim for newest or best, aim for reliable and dependable
 Cattle, not pets
 Make sure your cattle are self-minding—the less fiddling and doting and button-pressing you need to do, the better
 Make your own roadmap, be it your career or your department, have a direction and test it
 When you do a thing, understand why you are doing it. Google might give you an answer, but it doesn&#x27;t give you comprehension. Running a StackOverflow solution without understanding what&#x27;s going on will only lead to more problems in the future
 Don&#x27;t stay in one place too long
 Test your parachute, be it a tape backup or a rollback plan or a snapshot

 I use my local machine for meetings to avoid audio lag and want to be able to see the meeting while working on my remote machine.

 So (other than DNS) what’s your most problematic technology?

                              <span>Like the title says, I&#x27;ve got upper management claiming they need to be global admins, user admins, etc. 
 Before I was hired they were basically just winging it for managing their MS365 environment and giving anybody that needed any level of admin full blown global admin privileges. Now that I have started that isn&#x27;t going to fly and I am going through and taking away privileges. The issue is I have multiple people claiming they need admin permissions but judging by how things were done before I got here I am very hesitant to let anyone keep their privileges. I am leaning towards just taking the access away and see how long it takes for them to even notice but I would also like to have some data as to why I made that decision other than telling the CFO I don&#x27;t trust him to have admin privileges.
 Is there a report I can run showing the login history for the admin portals specifically? IE - I took your privileges away because you haven&#x27;t even logged into the admin portal since 2021.

                              <span>This advice that I&#x27;m sharing is regardless of your level of seniority or experience in the IT field, and not specific to Sys Admins, as there are plenty of other IT roles.
 There are a lot of jobs out there, many listings, and with the advent of remote/WFH the markets you can work in have substantially increased. This naturally results in an increased number of job opportunities for each of us to apply to or be considered for.
 So my advice, waste less of your time, less time of the recruiter, and get actually useful information up-front.
 If you&#x27;re a recruiter reading this, if you want to waste less of my time, give me these two things up-front. If you are an IT person (Sys Admin or otherwise) then it is in your best interest to require these two pieces of information FIRST, and yes even …</span>

                              <span>I manage a team of 10 (me+9). This morning one of my team texted me saying that they needed to take a mental health day. I texted back that those days are important, I didn&#x27;t want them to burn out, and I&#x27;d see them tomorrow. I hope they have a relaxing day playing video games or gardening or whatever they do to destress.
 Later in the day another guy was more or less reduced to tears after an encounter with an end-user. An hour later they were still visible shaken. I told him to take the rest of the day off, fully paid. Then I went and had a talk with the end-user and told them that their department and IT should be on the same team. I can&#x27;t have my people effectively helping him if he views us as the enemy and my team is scared to go help.
 Will we maybe have a larger load for the 8 of us left here today? Probably. Is it worth it so my people aren&#x27;t burnt out and leaving and we have to hire new people? Yes, 100x over.
 If you&#x27;re in a burnout situation, don&#x27;t let your company/MSP gaslight you into believing that all IT jobs are like that or that all managers/directors are like that. Pay for a resume refresh, apply for other jobs, find a place where you&#x27;re respected.

                              <span>Like many people I start my day with a list. Every day the majority of my list is &quot;following up with $vendor&quot;, I am just so tired of vendors doing half of the job and then ghosting us, or a service ticket with a vendor that has been active for months that has no sign of ever being resolved. At this point I have more issues and projects that I just accept as broken or un finished, its like they specialize in wearing you down until you just give in and give up. I never thought that most of my day would be spent this way.

It&#x27;s not just in IT/our field, it&#x27;s all over any type of forum/social media/emails/texts/communications. I&#x27;ve seen these mistakes in National/International ad campaigns from major companies - I guess they laid off all the copy editors in the most recent mass layoffs...
  
The plural of software is software, NOT softwares.
 Apostrophes are NOT for plurals - the plural of computer is computers, NOT computer&#x27;s.
 Apostrophes are for possession (That&#x27;s Joe&#x27;s computer), or for contractions (&quot;Joe&#x27;s using the computer&quot; instead of &quot;Joe is using the computer&quot;).
 Your is for possession - &quot;That&#x27;s your problem not mine&quot; NOT &quot;That&#x27;s you&#x27;re problem&quot;
 You&#x27;re is a contraction for &quot;you are&quot; - &quot;You&#x27;re going to the concert without me?&quot; NOT &quot;Your going to the concert without me.&quot;
  
And now back to our show...

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Emails from a self proclaimed &quot;cEo&quot; of some random software company. (I love checking their LinkedIn and seeing that they are a &quot;cUrRenT&quot; cEo&quot; of multiple companies at the same time, that&#x27;s always a good sign. /s
 &quot;Do I email you or [name of my CIO]? I have a lot of insight I want to share with you&quot;
 Me or my boss? Well, that&#x27;s easy, neither. You don&#x27;t get to email anyone here any more.
 The email has been reported as spam. The email/domain have been blocked company wide. The phone number has been blocked in the pbx.
 Numerous Phone calls/voicemails from (xxx) xxx-xxxx &quot;Hi, this is Nancy Adams, I need you to call me back when you get a chance. Thanks.&quot; Who the fuck is Nancy? Oh a random software company rep, oh...
 Blocked on PBX. Looked up company/domain/email, blocked on email, web filter. Left a solid yelp review indicating business marketing practices. I don&#x27;t think this is vindictive, not any more than calling someone leaving them a message saying &quot;Call me back!&quot;
 Every stupid fucking idea is brought to you by a recent bs-chool graduate who feels they need to &quot;apply&quot; their newly learned knowledge of bullshit.
 Do I sound upset? I&#x27;m a little upset. I&#x27;m done with this level of bullshit. This is a good place to vent.
 Edit: Why am I jumbling the case of the letters? It&#x27;s to indicate their level of L33tness.
 ​
 Edit2: I should add this comes on the heels of me actually calling one of the vendors back and saying we were not interested in their service at this time and in turn what they did is add me to a list and I received 12 phone calls from their competitors in 5 days. So I am NO LONGER calling anyone back. That is what I get for being a decent person.

                              <span>I need to be as low maintenance as possible. I&#x27;ve played the refurb game (yeah, yeah) with HP laptops to decent success but with a lot of small PITA issues over the years that have now become too time consuming to be worth it. 
 My requirements are low. Aside from Windows 10 Pro, I only need the user to connect to a VPN, use an EHR program and do Telehealth. So good camera/audio would be favorable but barely any firepower needed otherwise. 
 Basically wanna be like &quot;hey here&#x27;s your laptop you won&#x27;t need to bother me until you leave the company or you need a new battery years from now&quot; without breaking the bank. 
 Thanks guys

                              <span>Hello
 We are trying to migrate our on prem Exchange 2016 server to 365, but appear to have hit a roadblock from initial assessment while working with our MSP and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this issue?
 We have an on prem Exchange 2016, with Business Standard licenses in 365.
 For the last 2-3 years we have been creating user in AD, with sync to 365 and giving them a Business Standard license, which includes a Teams License, and Mailbox.
 The Mailbox doesn&#x27;t get used in 365, but still gets added as part of enabling the license. We just route all our mail to the on prem instance and connect Outlook to local exchange.
 The Teams license however does get used for scheduling video calls, and also creating the odd group and channels.
 My understanding is that to do a hybrid migration (and enable it), you can&#x27;t have existing mailboxes in the cloud and those mailboxes need to be deleted.
 I also understand that Teams stores all the chat data in the mailbox as well. 
 So do we need to purge all our existing Team Groups in 365, and chat data as well as - then enable hybrid migration - and re-create them to do our migration successfully? 
 We also use SharePoint, but I don&#x27;t believe that will cause any problems to the exchange migration as far as I know.
 Thanks for your help/input.

                              <span>Microsoft has moved to limiting people to create or use whitelists of known IP address ranges via conditional access policies... versus allowing blacklists of known bad actors. I don&#x27;t understand this move. People are mobile, work from home, have cell phones and all of these things use DHCP. How is anyone narrowing down whitelists?
 Where have the blacklist options gone? Why are we perpetually guessing what shifted today with these products?
 Most importantly, why are people scrambling to find and locate such basic things as inbound blocking/allowing? It&#x27;s because we now need a Microsoft Defender license for this &quot;Feature,&quot; which I feel is far too basic to be locked behind monetary incentive, and was never a paid for feature before this year.
 Its incredible how many times I have had to pull back the customer&#x27;s expectations for what is possible and not, when even the lay person can use words like &quot;block&quot; but I can&#x27;t without talking about cost.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 An organization I am working for is looking to move away from their aging on-prem based sFTP server to a cloud based sharing platform with traditional sFTP support as well as a web based portal for easier customer access. 
 There are lots of file sharing / collaboration offerings out there but finding one with that is more or less a hosted service offering traditional sFTP client support along with web portal based access is proving difficult. 
 We have looked into Files / Egnyte. 
 Are there others that anyone can recommend that are similar to Files? Looking for a service that can scale starting small, maybe 60-70 customers and grow to 200+ with a predictable pricing model. Data usage is not a concern and will fall well below the capacity offerings of most of these services. 
 Anyways, open to suggestions as this seems a bit niche. 
 Thanks

                              <span>We&#x27;re a small org, probably 20 or 30 people and live in the M365 world. While I am aware of the devices section of a users&#x27; 365 account I was wondering if there&#x27;s a better asset mgmt system for our laptops.
 Sure, we could just pop them in Excel on a Teams/Sharepoint site but that seems too easy, are there any tools aimes at small businesses that will help is keep an asset inventory (hardware and software) or even a tool that exports (or integrates) with 365 that will let us view it in one place?
 Perhaps there&#x27;s a section in Intune/MEM that does all this, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it.

                              <span>Morning all,
 Maybe I&#x27;m reading in to this far too much, but I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of resellers seem to get irate at the idea that I have multiple people quoting for the same thing. Even more so when I receive a lower quote from someone else.
 I was wondering if maybe I am doing something wrong here? I&#x27;ve never thought much about it. Don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong about trying to get the cheapest deal I can? But for example, we are currently quoting for a new chunk of hardware, we our usual supplier but also have 2 other companies this time who have both offered it cheaper. We&#x27;ve let our usual supplier know and they seem to be offended that we didn&#x27;t just blindly go with them? 
 Is it rude of me to give out their quotes for other people to try and match/best? I can&#x27;t imagine this sort of thing happening outside of IT but maybe I&#x27;m wrong.

 I&#x27;m hardening our environments and disabing TLS 1.0, i figured lets get TLS.1.1 out the way at the same time however today I broke RDP on a 2019 server implmenting this.
 TLS 1.2 was enabled both client and server keys as needed however after TLS 1.0 + 1.1 were disabled I couldnt RDP to the server (which is a domain controller). I was getting an NLA failure message - I do enforce NLA via GPO as its mandated by our cyber insurance coverage.
 I re-enabled TLS 1.1 and was able to resume normal operations on the server. Any ideas why this would break? The client (my laptop) has TLS 1.2 enabled, I cant understand why there is a reliance on TLS 1.1.

                              <span>Im sorry if this is a basic question, i cant find any help through google. Im a first year apprentice, so im still pretty new to all of this.
 Im essentially trying to configure a Syslog-Server with a Webinterface running on an Apache2 Webserver.
 I messed around a bit on my Raspberry PI4, and am now trying to replicate this on a VM at work. However im already failing at accessing the default page of the webserver.
 On my Raspberry PI and at home, all i had to do was install the server, and allow communication through my UFW. After that, i could reach the Default Page via my Raspberrys IP-Adress in my Browser. I assume it tried reaching the server on Port 80 by default.
 This however doesnt work on my VM. Firewall is active, the webserver can accept packages on port 80 and 443. However i cant even ping the VM from inside my network.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just inherited a deployment of a dozen or so VMs all setup in Azure, with more coming. These are currently all standalone with no domain, so each one doesn&#x27;t really have a consistent set of local firewall settings, local security policies etc. As I&#x27;m going to be hardening these in-line with the Security Centre recommendations, I&#x27;m thinking to add either a couple of DCs or Azure Active Directory Domain Services to the deployment, then domain-join the VMs so I can use Group Policy and standardize them all. Is this still the best approach, or is there a cloud-native agent that would let me achieve the same? Intune is out as these are all server OSes.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on the setup of an Apache (forward) proxy that does a proxy chain for certain sites.
 Here is the virtual host config:
  #8007 extranet ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html ErrorLog /var/www/log/error_8007.log CustomLog /var/www/log/access_8007.log combined ProxyRequests On ProxyVia On #some-site.com Proxy Chain ProxyRemote &quot;http://some-site.com/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot; ProxyRemote &quot;http://portal.some-site.com/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot; ProxyRemote &quot;http://apex.some-site.com:8089/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot; ProxyRemote &quot;http://info.some-site:8380/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot;  
 However, when I test it and try to access http://apex.some-site.com:8089/images/favicon-16x16.png
 the connection fails and the Apache log shows 
  - - [14/Feb/2023:10:21:04 +0100] &quot;\x16\x03\x01\x02&quot; 400 226 &quot;-&quot; &quot;-&quot;
 I googled it and it says the client tries to connect via https but I don&#x27;t get why. There is no https invloved. When I connect to the URL through the current proxy (that is to be replaced) my browser shows that the connection is not secure as it just http.
 Any idea why it&#x27;s trying https?

                              <span>Hi! We are a company with 30ish employees, I am looking for a solution that we can use for file storage for our projects.
 We have 100-150 projects a year, they have from a few Gigabytes up to 150-200GB of files associated to them. Most of them are images and binaries.
 I&#x27;d like to set up a centralized file storage for these projects. I&#x27;d like it to be easy to access, easy to admin and easy to back up. We have Microsoft 365 basic (and standard for some users). I&#x27;d prefer a cloud based solution because I don&#x27;t trust our network and I&#x27;m not touching that yet because I already own plenty of our infrastructure...
 Users are somewhat tech savvy but I&#x27;d prefer to have something that&#x27;s easy to set up and organize.
 Any suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 I&#x27;m currently in the process of finding a digital signage solution for our business. Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for a solution that can display both websites and PowerPoint presentations and is remotely manageable.
 I&#x27;d like to setup 2 bigger touchscreens in the lobby. Visitors should be able to use the touchscreen to navigate through our website as well as display promotional materials such as PowerPoint slides. The player should have WiFi because cabling is a bit difficult.
 Does anyone have experience with a digital signage solution that fits these criteria? Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 I have looked into Yodeck, Xibo and Posterbooking and Samsungs MagicInfo CMS solution. Tending to use Posterbooking + some smart touchscreen TV with a Fire Stick because this seems simple enough and up to 10 screens are free.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hiya, I work for an organisation with around 400 users, when it comes to Adobe most just use Adobe Reader but we currently have around 60 users licensed for Acrobat Pro and about 20 licensed for Creative Cloud. IT management want to recharge the cost of these licenses to departmental/team cost codes, but we&#x27;re really struggling with how to keep track of which licenses belong to which team. When a new license is purchased it just goes into one big pool in our Adobe Admin Console, we can allocate it to a new user but there&#x27;s nothing identifiable about the license itself so no real way to track it as an asset or tag it as owned by a particular team. What would be ideal is a system where we can create groups for different teams and then allocate licenses to each group, I&#x27;m just wondering if there&#x27;s any tool or method that makes this easily possible? Currently all I think to do is have a process of meticulous record keeping in an Excel workbook where we track how many licenses are purchased under each cost code and who is using each license, but this obviously isn&#x27;t ideal. We need to ensure that licenses are kept within the teams that are paying for them rather than moving around the organisation as people join and leave.

 We are using MS Apps standalone packages like 2016, 2019 &amp; 2021 and purchasing the key from the local market and online. Sync the key with different emails (Outlook.com)
 Transferring the license, reactivation, and tracking these details is very difficult.
 is there any tool or software (free and paid) availabile to manage this?
 I really appreciate any help you can provide.

 Wondering if anyone has better details on what is actually involved in this process.
 Also - 10GB, what are they doing, moving to steam?

                              <span>Do you run it? I am getting a server with this SSD (not requested but as a bonus ....) and I am thinking about it. Server won&#x27;t be virtualized, it has plenty RAM for its intended purpose. Maybe some kind of cache?

                              <span>Just curious how widely or if anyone is using Intel vPro to enable their RMM. I don’t think there is any straight vPro RMM, but I know there are a few applications that leverage it to enable remote management. If you have used (a RMM that leveraged) this, can you share your experience?

                              <span>I have been doing IT for about 25 years now and never been so stressed and full of anxiety. Seems like every time I turn on the news or anything these big companies are getting compromised. Every time I see something strange, crowdstike alert, or phishing attempt my heart starts racing thinking what did I do wrong. To know if I make 1 mistake or forget to patch 1 thing and open a hole I could ruin a company. It is starting to affect my home life as well. 
 How do people cope with this? I have really been thinking about switching careers, but no idea what I would want to do. I love technology and can&#x27;t see myself do anything else but can&#x27;t go on living like this.

                              <span>Genuinely asking as I see a lot of people post in this subreddit about the negatives of working at an MSP. No surprise here, I currently work at an MSP. And while it is absolutely crazy sometimes, I also find myself listening to our customers talk about their jobs and they all seem extremely stressed as well. What I personally like about the MSP life is that it offers diversity:
  
Diversity of equipment. Every customer brings a different set of “happy little accidents” to the table and I find that challenge interesting even if I’m not personally the one helping to architect new solutions.
 
Diversity of focus. If you want to be pigeon-holed or expertise in a specific area, you can. But there are also tons of opportunities for crossover experiences in other areas.
 
Diversity of customer. Yes you get difficult customers. But you also get some pretty great ones to work alongside. I feel like this is a big benefit and helps to balance the crazy sometimes.
 
Diversity of ideas. In some ways you’re playing with house money. You can help the customer come up with solutions without having to worry about the dollars and cents. After all, that’s on them to figure out at the end of the day. Obviously you have to be reasonable and help work toward something that benefits everyone involved. But again, that’s a challenge that can be fulfilling.
 
 Those are just a few. And sure, you could read those with the same lenses of a non-MSP job. But isn’t that the point? Why is it such a negative too work at an MSP? Interested to hear from others.

                              <span>The CEO of the company is asking to look into migrating folders/files from the file server to sharepoint. I am not a sharepoint expert but wanted to ask for those of you who have done this, do you recommend this? Pros and Cons? Any pain points or issues? Obviously every company is different and this solution might work for some but not others. Not sure how to determine if this would be a good idea or not. 
 We do have Quickbooks running on a terminal server but I would keep QB files away from sharepoint and have them on a file server still.
 File server contains about 1TB of data and company has about 50-60 users. Please let me know if there is any relevant information that you would like me to include.

                              <span>I’d like to have a tool set at each office server room, but it will probably be used once or twice a year at most. I see a lot of tool kits on Amazon that would probably work. This wouldn’t be my primary set, but instead something I could ship/order to the remote offices ahead of time so I don’t need to deal with taking tools with me.

 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 I am a middle aged - say late 40s - IT Manager. My background is a Windows generalist.
 I have degree, not much in certifications, 25+ years of systems experience. I&#x27;ve done desktop support, led a helpdesk, been a Sys Admin, Sys Engineer (whatever that title means) and eventually wandered into management. I can cover a few bases - SQL Queries, basic networking, Power BI, PowerShell. I know my way around AD and M365 pretty well. IE - I am a Windows Jack of All Trades, certified master of none. I have been in my current role for just over 6 years, leading a small team (3 people) for a medium sized blue collar company. I make just under 6 fi…</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 We have a few networks that are through vWire. We recently experienced an issue with one of these networks where some the clients (static IPs) could no longer reach their gateway/Internet.
 Meanwhile, a different client on the same network was operating just fine and reaching its gateway/Internet.
 On our Nexus, we disabled the interface that was leading to the passive PAN. The issue was instantly resolved. We re-enabled the interface, experienced no issues for a few days only for the issue to return. LLDP is enabled in PAN for vWire if that helps.
 Any suggestions? I&#x27;d appreciate it, thanks!
 C9300, Stacked (between internal PAN and WAN PAN): interface TenGigabitEthernet1/1/6 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk interface TenGigabitEthernet2/1/6 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk Nexus 9K: interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 no shutdown interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 
 Edit:
 We&#x27;re currently using Aggregate Ethernet for vWire in PAN.
 vWire when using Aggregate Ethernet does not support LACP, just LLDP.
 We&#x27;re thinking of just removing AE to standalone links with LACP. Thoughts?

                              <span>Does anyone have any recommendations for a good label maker for marking cables, equipment, etc? I&#x27;ve found that our current label maker labels peel off of the cables after being in the server rack for a few weeks probably due to cheap adhesive.
 Cost isn&#x27;t really a concern. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, I hope somebody can shed some light on a problem that I am observing. I have the above Nexus layer 3 switch with a 1G ethernet transceiver and a CATx cable around 20m length plugged to an HP laptop also with an onboard ethernet port, auto-speed/duplex at both ends. The problem is that despite both ends being logically active, the link reports as not connected, when both ends are then physically connected. Bring down and bring back up the port on the Laptop (Windows Networking disable/enable) everything springs into life. Same symptoms observed plugging into another network device, although in that case, no option exists to manually down/up the interface (cheap IP cam) Plug the same devices and the cable into another switch, different brand but same logical configuration - it all comes up first time. So to me it&#x27;s not the cable, and points to something on the Nexus. Nexus port config however is a really simple one;
 Interface eth1/27 switchport switchport access vlan 3 no shutdown 
 Has anybody seen this before, or could offer some clues on further diagnostic actions please?
 Ps already tried to post this in r/cisconetworking but apparently one has to be a trusted member..

                              <span>To my knowledge there are only 2 true Whitebox solutions available on the market if you want to run a switching solution over Whitebox switches and they are Pica8 and Sonic. I&#x27;m talking if you wanted to buy a Whitebox switching solution right now. It seems like there has to be more options than this. I&#x27;ll make the analogy of when IP devices exploded and your spreadsheet was no longer an option. 
 If you wanted something rock solid to manager your IPs you bought either Infoblox or Bluecat. If your environment was not too large you could get away with Solar Winds which at the time was more of a spreadsheet on steroids.
 Does any such Whitebox solution exist if I were to get some Edgecore switches?
 ​
 thanks in advance
