                              <span>Interesting article about tech companies cutting benefits.
 I myself watched as the company I wrapped up my long career up with, a company with billion dollar annual profits, slowly but very steadily chip away at every benefit from healthcare to office conditions over the last several years. Looking back I was glad to have been there &quot;during the good times&quot; and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. 
 In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their &quot;thousand small cuts over time&quot; approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I&#x27;m not saying to Unionize (and I&#x27;m not saying not to, either), but it&#x27;s clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you&#x27;re quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.

Nothing seem to get rid of this error.She viewing files at 75% zoom for the most part so adjusting it to 100% or some other zoom would be a bit insufficient as it would be harder to view due to the resolution. Either getting this error or blank pages with random PDFs. Anyone have any ideas?

Everything has been working fine for quite a while, however one of our apps is externally linking to Google Maps and that site no longer works in IE Mode. In MS technet, it states: 
 &quot; This policy gives you time to identify and configure all of the authentication servers used by your IE mode sites. &quot;
 Have any of you identifies all of the &quot;authentication servers&quot; in your environment? What is the level of difficulty and what tools did you use?

                              <span>To reduce the IT Overhead at our company, we are swapping everyone from Verizon to ATT.
 Verizon - $40/month
 ATT - $25/Month
 Both have unlimited text/call/data with data reducing speeds for individual if they go over 50GB/month.
 I have tried to call and negotiate with Verizon on dropping us down to match ATT, but they dont seem to be budging. Ive already swapped around 100 from Verizon. Still around 250 to go. Anyone have a similar experience or were you able to get more reasonable rates at Verizon?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;ve come across a problem with our D-Link DGS-3120-48TC switches. We have three stacked together and I had set one port to a VLAN (L2 Features -&gt; VLAN -&gt; 802.1Q VLAN Settings) and also enabled the guest VLAN on that port as well (Security -&gt; 802.1X -&gt; Guest VLAN Settings), so that a device that doesn&#x27;t get authenticated by 802.1X, it automatically gets put into the guest VLAN. 
 Now, I removed the guest VLAN setting and wanted to configure the same port to a new VLAN while also removing it from the first VLAN. This, however, shows the error &quot;The guest VLAN member port cannot be configured.&quot; This only happens when trying to assign it to VLAN 1. Every other VLAN works, but I need the PC attached in VLAN 1 x)
 Has anyone stumbled upon this as well and can lead me in the right direction?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think our network is infallible. Once in a while, sure, it&#x27;s something on our network! But I&#x27;ve been spending a ridiculous amount of time lately trying to prove to third party support that various issues are not &quot;network problems&quot;. It&#x27;s their default go-to and it&#x27;s pissing me off.
 These are examples that have taken a ridiculous amount of my time over just the past month:
  
New POS system at a remote location, network blamed for equipment going down for several days. Turns out to be a licensing renewal issue on their end. No apologies for their mistake. It ended up happening AGAIN at another location later.
 MDM system stops allowing certain IT staff to enroll mobile devices properly. &quot;Must be something you did on your end&quot; - ends up being a change they made on their end.
 SSO for a third-party app stops working randomly one night - &quot;Must be a network issue on your end&quot; - spend hours trying to troubleshoot and nothing our end changed, turns out to be a bad coding change on their end.
 Outlook add-in for large CRM stops working for certain employees, but not others. &quot;It&#x27;s your Outlook version&quot; - prove that it isn&#x27;t by having a user with access to all orgs try all in the same instance of Outlook. This is still a pending issue and can&#x27;t get them to accept responsibility.
  
I know I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here but I&#x27;m so sick of it. Wasting all kinds of time trying to prove to first level support dumbasses that read scripts all day to let me talk to someone who knows what the hell they&#x27;re talking about. Even escalating just leads to more dumbasses that won&#x27;t accept responsibility for issues.

                              <span>We have Adobe Reader on most of our systems because one of the main applications that we use here requires it. The only problem is the company that makes the software wants us to run very old versions of Adobe Reader because of compatibility with their product. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s laziness on their end but not being able to update our PDF software is a risk on our end. I know the normal response is usually get another vendor, but trust me when I tell you this is not an option.
 I&#x27;m worried about PDF attachments that come through email. I am really at a loss how to handle this. Keep AR at older versions but protect against email attachments. Just saying it makes me feel stupid. I know the answer is &quot;you want to keep a vulnerable version of AR but you want to security as well?&quot; I hear you. I&#x27;m just looking for possible solutions right now. How would you guys handle this email issue? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a cryptography expert, nor am I a sysadmin. But I&#x27;m playing around with PKI (mostly mostly client auth/sign), but I think a relatable example that most sysadmins will get is PKI use for S/MIME.
 Yes, you can pay $50/email address to some certificate authority, but many will also roll out their own PKI. It all depends on the use case of course, do you just need non-repudiation for internal use, or do you want outside recipients to verify emails.
 But it&#x27;s 2023. Let&#x27;s Encrypt lets you get DV certificates for free, but those certificates only support TLS server/client authentication EKUs.
 Why can&#x27;t we have free validated S/MIME certificates (and other types of certificates)?
 Why can&#x27;t we have our own CA for a domain, and have our &quot;local root&quot; signed by a &quot;real&quot; CA just like any other intermediate CA, so we can generate our own certificates that work on our own domains? Servers would need to also serve intermediate certificates that are under our control so the chain can be fully built since those links are missing in browser/computer root stores, but that&#x27;s just a few extra bytes.

                              <span>A client has 3 licenses of a software which are shared on 5 computers. According to the license it is ok to share those licenses (up to 2 users per each license), however cannot be used simultaneously.
 Obviously the users forget to close the software one they are finished and just leave it running in the background, thus blocking others who need to launch it on their computers.
 Is there a way to detect when a process has been idle for more than 15 minutes, so that we can then run a command to kill the process from memory?
 I tried using PowerShell but it seems that there is no property which gives how long the process has been idle.
 Maybe someone out there knows of a software that can reliably monitor a specified process for this type of scenario.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So we recently had a major problem with an DPM server going down (We suspect an windows update gone corrupt) 
 Now the server is semi stable and it never freezes or crashes HOWEVER now the DPM just outright stops at random I&#x27;ve checked the eventlog which pointed me towards REFS.
 The errors we are getting before it hangs is: ID 129 - vhdmp and ID 51 - disk
 We have implemented the REFS fixes that Microsoft recommends to no avail.
 Nothing have been changed on the server since this error started to occur (it have been running for approx. 3 months)
 Some info about the server: Windows Server 2022 - updated to latest Microsoft SQL 2022 - updated to latest DPM 2022 - updated to latest.
 The DPM disk is 40TB and is running through Think system raid 9350 card.
 Anyone that can point me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hi
 I am putting a bunch of new desktop computers into a laboratory where noise must be kept to a minimum. Because of this, the computers live in a separate room from the monitors and keyboards which must be connected over CAT 6 cables in the walls.
 Does anyone know of a reliable (and hopefully affordable) brand of adapters which can take the USB (keyboard and mouse) and Displayport (monitors) connections and put them onto the CAT6 cables?

                              <span>Hi All
 We have come across this weird issue auto signing into Edge default profile . Currently we deploy devices using on premise MDT. When a device joins the domain, it checks in with Group Policy and applies the following user GPs
 • Force users to sign-in to use the browser
 • Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account

 This works great and Edge signs in perfectly.

                              <span>This might seem very odd. But my isp is telling me that a ping of 240ms+ (some times up to 320) between servers here (Melbourne Australia) and servers in New York (Ithica) is &quot;normal&quot; the time jump when doing a trace rout from NY only jumps from like 12ms to 240ms when it hits the backbone routers in Indonesia before like 4 more hops to our servers here. 
 Does this in fact seem &quot;normal&quot; ... or am I loosing my brain ? Having issues with apps timing out because of this... ISP is trying to tell me that sort of ping time is &quot;normal&quot; .. Ill shut up if it is.. just means I&#x27;m going to have to do a deep dive to fig out why things are now timing out between these two points when they have been running fine for years...

                              <span>so we got a few (I think 10) Teams licenses as part of our Legacy Silver partnership with M$ in 2021 and they expired this week. I understand that now if we want to continue to use it, we need to purchase the license, this is fine. But it looks like this type of license cannot be renewed for the same email address, it requires me to create new profile and my past conversations/history get (apparently) lost. Ever happened to any of you? What am I doing wrong?
 Is there a way to download conversation history from Teams if my license expired?

 Currently have a garbage Peplink Balance 20. Maxes at 150-200mbps throughput and really HIGH latency.
 Have about 15-20 users concurrently (up to 100 devices), all network traffic is mainly CRM/ERP software which is all web based and 15 or so VOIP Phones.
 Debating between Netsense, Fortinet, Cisco, etc. Want DUAL WAN capability with load balancing.
 Fortinet 60f or 80F is what I&#x27;ve been leaning more towards. What are you thoughts? Price is a main concern for owners, but quality is most important in terms of up time. This will be self administered and i&#x27;m a techy guy but we&#x27;re not doing anything fancy on the network.
 Just lots of traffic of all kinds, nothing huge data file wise, just mainly lost of secure web traffic for our cloud hosted CRM/ERP/ETC.
 Will need to add about 4-6 Wireless AP&#x27;s throughout the building so also something that has a Wireless AP solution would be great.

                              <span>Hey guys
 I have a strange behavior with a system I added to my Windows Server Hyper-V Failover Cluster in Server 2022.
 The servers have nearly the same configuration - the CPUs are a Intel Xeon Gold and Intel Xeon Silver:
 Cluster with Server 1 and Server 2 (the new Server).
 Behavior not working:
  
VM is on Server1 and I want to Live Migrate to Server 2
 not working, because of &quot;processor specific features&quot; - but the CPU compatibility mode from the VM is activated
  
Behavior working:
  
If I shutdown the VM and do a fast failover from Server 1 to Server 2 it&#x27;s working and I can start and work with the VM
 
If I do then a failover from Server 2 to Server 1 it&#x27;s working
 
A switch back from Server 1 to Server 2 is working as well
 
When the VM is on Server 2 I can restart and shutdown the VM and after starting again I&#x27;m able to live migrate to Server 1
 
 At this point it&#x27;s not working anymore:
  
When I shutdown or restart the VM on Server 1, I&#x27;m not able to do a failover to Server 2 (see behavior not working - processor specific features)
  
Server1 and Server2 have the same Hyper-V Manager settings and I already tried with a new, from scratch, installed Windows VM.
 Where is the difference? Why is the normal failover working as long as the machine is moved in shutdown state and failovered while it&#x27;s running until it&#x27;s shutdown/restart on a different server (Server 1).
 I found something about Bios/Driver differences but since both servers are not equal, I have differences.

 It just checks the &quot;Company Name&quot; and adds users to the group if they match. However we have some managers that also need to be added that have a different company name. Is there any way I can do this?

                              <span>Currently looking for a new backup solution and looks like the leading two are Rubrik and Commvault. We use a mix of VMware and Nutanix AHV which means Cohesity is out of the mix due to lack of full support for AHV. Due to funding any cloud-based DRAAS such as Commvault&#x27;s metallic is also not going to be considered.
 We already have Veeam so we know what that offers.
 Large Hospital and have about 1000 VMs with 150 Physical - more to be onboarded soon. Need on-site and cloud storage for backup copies.
 Has anyone used both Rubrik and Commvault? What do you recommend? I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re both great products but Commvault is a lot more complicated to set up and manage.

                              <span>I am on site doing a server replacement 3k miles from our home office. Went to swap the server our latest servers are these fanlesa custom unites that are low profile and all solid state, the have a pci e x4 slot with the back cut off of it but no way to mount a card at all as the chassis will not allow. The situation is that the client has a piece of software that is mission critical to be online from 10am-10pm, and the license key is currently a parallel key that is plugged into a parallel pci card in their current system. I only have a few days on site and need to find a workaround, I have that pcie x4 slot and USB basically are my only options to figure something out. Our newer stuff uses USB license keys and we can convert this one but it wouldn&#x27;t get done fast enough. Lastly I am in Anaheim so I have access to all of Anaheim and LA which may help my odds finding some adapter card or something locally thanks everyone.

                              <span>We have dozens of Windows 10 Enterprise laptops, all enrolled in Azure AD + Intune, that we want to wipe remotely with the script/app.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has tested a method to perform a remote wipe, as we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on the issue and have had little luck.
 We&#x27;ve been using Graph API calls, like the one below, experimenting with different commands and payloads. For 90% of our test cases, we&#x27;ve had the same result: the system is partially wiped, with most of the data left on the device, and after reboots, the user is presented with a login to the Admin account, not OOBE.
 We&#x27;ve tried many variations of the API call and have even checked the API calls from the Intune portal using dev tools, but all our efforts have produced the same, unsatisfactory result. Our problem seems to apply only to Windows 10 devices. A few tested Windows 11 devices were wiped successfully.
 calls used: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices/XXXXXX/cleanWindowsDevice or /Wipe with different payloads etc. Also non-beta calls fails.

 SME here. MS365. Only work-from-home. No vpn. No centralized hardware.
 I have an individual user that has continuously corrupted pst-files on his W11 device. Were others don&#x27;t have (or most exceptionally have) this issue.
 After extensive trial &amp; error, I&#x27;m starting to suspect intermittent internetconnection.Speedtest is pretty fast, ping is ok, but when in teams-meeting we have also experienced small hickups and even disconnects. So I&#x27;m thinking her wired connection is kind of bad quality, drops the connection, hence device goes over to wifi, and back, and back, and back. Resulting in Outlook to start flipping.
 Any particular application where I can the user have to run a log for a few days and see what&#x27;s happening on her machine?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I already made my first post with a question about MS Defender for Endpoint about a month ago, since I have to do a little Presentation about it. 
 I am facing a new problem, which I can&#x27;t solve on my own (at least it looks like that). But now to my problem: 
 I want to know each possible column which I can get on Vuln. like CVE-ID, Description and so on. I was able to open a trial account with my student email and it works fine for MS Defender for Endpoint and Intune, but I can&#x27;t get access with the same acc to PowerBi and to Azure. I used an other Account to get Azure (and tried to set up some test vm´s), but I am not able to onboard them into MS Defender for VM. 
 What do I need ? 
 I got a report example about some Vuln. which I can&#x27;t reproduce with just using MS Endpoint and MS for Cloud and I would need a report with a few different (test) vulnerabilities, that are active, closed or in remediation with ALL possible columns. I tried every report feature in the application itself and I would like to know if there are more columns possible if I for example use the PowerBi Interface ? Its really hard, since the Documentation is not really precise in a lot of things like states etc.
 Sorry for my not very accurate English ... and also, if I did not understand sth. right - I am new in this field and not very experienced. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys, just looking into an issue a client noticed on their RD environment and I cannot figure out what&#x27;s happened.
 Basically 1 user has taken up 3 of the RD licenses (CAL&#x27;s) If you open RD licensing manager you can see the licenses active on an individual user bases, but then 1 user has 3 assigned to himself. The only thing that stands out as odd to me is it shows slightly different uppercase/lowercase characters for each of the entry&#x27;s. for example:
 CompanyDomain\joe.blogs - Issued on 18th may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.Blogs - Issued on 15 may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.blogs - Issued on 03 may 2023 - Active
 Notice each entry has different capital letters. this is a replica of how it shows in RD Licensing manager 
 1st entry has no capitals
 2nd entry has capitals on both names
 3rd entry has 1 capital on the first name and all lowercase second name. 
 They have 20 licenses in total, all active but 3 are assigned to this 1 guy
 user is only logged into 1 server at the moment of 3 RDS servers. RDBroker shows this is also the case.
 I can see in our RMM system they have more than 1 workstation. PC in office and laptop for remote working. Is it possible they&#x27;ve been given multiple licenses because they may have connected in from multiple workstations at some point? doesn&#x27;t explain why he&#x27;s got 3 when he only has 2 workstations if that were the case.

                              <span>Evening
 Just wanted to hear from anyone with a similar experience. Was handed a laptop with my new role last October to which it&#x27;s a 7 year old lenovo with Windows home. November last year even after an SSD and ram upgrade to 8GB (from 4) still struggling with cpu. I&#x27;ve had to turn off noise filtering a little while ago in teams to make it usable during long meetings. I have an email trail since November asking for a new laptop screen and dock stating the reasons and its been stalled ever since, every meeting catchup with manager there&#x27;s a different excuse or blame on the further delayed merger talks. Latest is I&#x27;ve got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can&#x27;t switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I&#x27;m at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow. Today&#x27;s advice from manager was to create a work profile on my personal laptop, as we all need to make personal sacrifices. Kind on makes me think I should go back to an MSP, respected in my last few. Maybe I should invoice them for use of my laptop?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am working with a customer and am having an issue where devices are requiring a reboot in order to register back online intermittently. The devices are PoE + and require 30Watts to each one but that does not appear to be the problem as the customer sent back information that leads me to believe that cant be the issues (switches are definitely not overloaded). Below is the switch info along with the commands they are pushing to each port for the device before we install them.
 Cisco enterprise 3850 switches
 description **PA System**
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport mode access
 no logging event link-status
 no snmp trap link-status
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 I am by no means a network guy but could a standard QoS setting be causing a problem here? These are PA notification devices so they need to be set up to take priority over any other devices on the network incase of emergency. Could there be some kind of shut down due to inactivity possibly? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>So there are two buildings. Instead of paying for internet for both buildings we use a wireless bridge from one building to the other. I need to access a HA server I have setup down there. So the way it is all set up is:
 ISP &gt; Eero Mesh Network &gt; Wireless Bridge
  
Another Eero Mesh Network &gt; HA server.
  
Do you have any suggestions on how to access the the HA server from the first Eero network? The wireless bridge doesn&#x27;t seem to share the LAN or have any port forwarding options in the web interface.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve a 4 mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ setup, configured as two pairs of switches.
 Each pair has MLAG configured between them and hardware nodes are connected to one port in each via LACP. This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.
 My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.
 Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.
 Is this normal? I&#x27;ve not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I&#x27;d generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.

 Anyone use a ups vendor that&#x27;s reliable at all? We&#x27;d pretty much just want to be hands off when it comes to battery backup units. Vendor comes into the closets to replace the batteries or full units when needed or reach end of life.

                              <span>The Frame Loss Rate for EtherSAM testing (EXFO FTB1 880V2 Netblazer) is expressed as, for example, 1.0E-03. Which by my maths is 0.001. But what? is it a percentage? Is it that many errors per second. We just do it as pass/fail but it would be nice to know what it relates too. Appreciate your help.

                              <span>Looking to replace a Peplink Balance 20 for a company that has 2 1gig/1gig ISP connections. Have 15-20 users concurrently and most webtraffic is secure CRM/ERP cloud site access offsite.
 What would be the bet enterprise grade Dual WAN Routers that are easy to administer and don&#x27;t have all the fancy functions? We have very basic network and security needs, and really don&#x27;t store any data onsite. Everything is in Vendor Cloud&#x27;s.
 Will also need to deploy wireless AP&#x27;s so something that talks to eachother for setup and administration would be great.
 Price sensitive. Would be deploying 4-6 AP&#x27;s throughout the building, indoors.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in learning more about service provider network architecture and design, specifically when building out networks for b2b, though residential sounds interesting as well. When looking around for reading materials I&#x27;ve found &quot;Cisco ISP Essentials&quot; Barry Raveendran Greene and Philip Smith, but this was written over 20 years ago. Is there anything more recent that you might recommend? I get the feeling the only other material out there stuff for the Cisco NP/IE SP track? (Which I&#x27;m also looking into, but I&#x27;m just curious if there was other resources in addition to that)

I wondered if there are any similar network simulation quizzes out there for learning purposes? Preferable free, but i dont mind paying for it. The ones i found and where free to test are all like questionaires. But i would like to have this simulation style.

                              <span>Last week a department put in an incident saying an email was not delivered and because of that it cost the company a substantial amount of money and they are saying the email system messed up. The email SME did his research- it was Exchange- no external email. Someone internally email an attachment to a DL and none of those people in the DL claimed they received it, but mail flow and Exchange Reporter said they did. We were able to show who sent the message and when it was received by all the people in the DL which are internal as well.
 Fast forward to today and that department is sticking to it’s guns that the company email system messed up and the email just “disappeared”
 Really?! FFS are users this dumb? Not one but FOUR in the DL? What more do you want I thought? I was told by my leadership to find hard proof the message was there. So I did.
 I gave my adm account access to the mailboxes and logged into each one and found the message. The person causing the most stink- I found the message in their recover deleted items and it had been deleted four minutes after it was received.
 Now the department is blaming us because the file doesn’t have the right content- sorry that is not even remotely the IT department’s responsibility- please find another way to spin it how you f**ked up and don’t blame IT!

                              <span>One of the clients we work with is going out of business, they are shutting down the tenant and getting rid off the domain; they are closing for good. All users have M365 E3 license and all computers are correctly enrolled in Intune via AutoPilot and AzureAD Joined. The owner of the company would like to donate all company owned laptops, so I need to remove them from AutoPilot and Intune. 
 How can I remove around 100 Windows 10 devices from the Microsoft 365 tenant? Keep in mind that all computers have BitLocker enabled via Intune Policy so I need an option that will not trigger BitLocker.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>TLDR: is there a setting for RDP that would cause a session reset if a file or type of file is copied through the session?
 Like to read see below: For some specific reason we use this, I am new~ish to the team so don’t roast me just yet, but I have been getting complaints from day 3 that this process fails. When asked if it ever worked I get a “yea?”. It’s happening across multiple different systems across multiple networks. The only constant is windows 10 is the OS connecting to the servers rdp session. All the windows 10 are a base image to a bunch of vdi pools, the servers are scattered across networks and these vdi are used to manage it all. The user can have admin access to one or both side and get this. It seems to be 99% of users, like 1 person can get it to work and it’s pissing his peers off. 
 Work flow User pc&gt;vdi&gt;rdp 
 Any direction would be appreciated I thought I knew terminal server until now!

                              <span>We got our first ever IT intern. We are looking for some things to help him learn, outside of shadowing and doing some easier tasks. He&#x27;s very green, still in college. He has some programming and database experience from school. We have decided it probably wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to throw him on helpdesk as it would take just as long as the internship lasts to get him up to speed. Not saying he won&#x27;t do troubleshooting, just not the entire time. 
 If you were an intern, what are some things you wished you had picked up in the sysadmin field that maybe you didn&#x27;t during your internship. 
 Appreciate the feedback!

 If I try to start it with powershell I get an error related to permissions:
 PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; start-vm PTIDPAPRDAP1 start-vm : &#x27;PTIDPAPRDAP1&#x27; failed to start.

 Happens to any vm at any host. Any idea on what might be happening?
 Edit: will try to reinstall one host and bring the vm&#x27;s up there.

                              <span>We have LAPS setup and configured, but we’re having a disagreement internally about how to best retrieve the password. If we’re trying to avoid using privileged domain creds on a desktop, what’s the most secure way for a tech to retrieve the password? Whether we launch ADUC or use a Powershell script from the tech’s local desktop, we still need to auth to the domain.
 LAPS solves the local credential cache issue, but if the machine is compromised in some way (keylogger etc) then elevating to the domain to retrieve the password still potentially exposes these accounts.
 How are you all dealing with this? Not allowing techs to elevate from their local machines and using an isolated bastion host instead?

If servicedesk can&#x27;t solve it, the ticket is assigned to the responsible department (Applications, End-devices &amp; support, Infrastructure) 3. If support can&#x27;t solve it, the ticket is assigned to either applications or infrastructure. 
 This morning I pulled a queued ticket that support wasn&#x27;t able to solve. My colleague in the support department mentioned that he performed several checks on the users client. When I phoned the user, I casually chatted about the actions my colleague supposedly took. The user didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about. He said that noone from IT contacted her this day so I was a little curious.
 After the call I mailed my colleague …</span>

 Network Admin
 System Admin
 Full-time Employee
 Temporary Employee
 Manager/Team Lead
 I said only the network admin and system admin should receive privileged accounts and I got it wrong because the CISO should have also received privileged roles. I&#x27;ve worked at a number of companies and not once has a Chief anything Officer received any sort of admin permissions; they only dictate policy, budgets, etc.
 What are your opinions on this? Do the executives at your companies perform admin duties?

                              <span>I need to replace ours. All options are on the table. We have many remote sites all connected to our network.
 We have road warriors who will need a softphone.
 We have salespeople who need BYOD cellphone integration.
 We have desk jockeys who will need a hardware phone.
 We have Call centers that need reporting.
 We need to record every single call, all the time, and keep them for seven years. (regulatory requirement).

 For example, in June there are 
  
8 Retirements (RPS in Exchange Online, OMEV1, Azure AD and MSOnline PS modules, etc.), 
 6 Enhancements (&#x27;Hourly&#x27; notification for quarantine policy, Ability to move selected videos in Stream migration tool, etc.) 
 1 License Plan Change.
  
Don&#x27;t miss out! Dive in now:

 Windows server 2016 running under VMWare esxi6.7U3.
 I am using VMFS6
 I want to add approximately 50-60TB single disk size to this server.
 My questions are :
 1- I’m wondering what is your strategies/tricks about backuping a large vm (many TB+)? Anybody have any experience backing up a virtual machine of that size.
 2- I will use NTFS File system. What do you recommended as Cluster Size ?
 3- If I use a large size disk, what are the disadvantages?
 thanks,

                              <span>In our shop I have been ordering the cheapest GPU for our Dell OptiPlex orders. I have been under the impression this would help the computer to offload some of work of running two monitors. These are just desktops for staff and students. 
 At this point, are the two included/onboard DisplayPort ports enough to run two monitors and I can stop ordering desktops with the GPU and save the money?

I found where I can access these labels, but they are greyed out under Azure Information Protection. What we also noticed is that in the Outlook Preview the two labels don&#x27;t exist. However this will take a good few months before this version will even be rolled out. Can anyone provide me with some support on how to get rid of the two labels in question? Thanks in advance

 I have tried disable/ enable syncing in the settings as recommended everywhere. Also tried removing the profile and re adding but nothing works. When I resync in the settings, it does say setting up sync then goes back to the can&#x27;t sync error.
 Anyone come across this before?? I ha e about another 20 users all running ok with same setup.

                              <span>I just enrolled my personal device to test Android device management in Intune. I added some apps from the Managed Google Play Store. I made some required, and some available. The required ones were installed, but when I open the Google Play Store for Work nothing shows in the list of available apps.
 The apps were all made available to &quot;All Users.&quot; Some I made available for enrolled devices, some I made available with or without enrollment, just to see if that made a difference. Still, nothing is showing as available.
 Also, what&#x27;s the difference between &quot;Available for enrolled devices&quot; and &quot;Available with or without enrollment?&quot; How would someone access the available apps if their device isn&#x27;t enrolled?

 I would like to ask for your help. We have some folder shares in our company that after years the folder path overlaps the 260 characters. Our enviroment is windows-server based. 
 Is there any way to prevent this issue? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Interesting issue. I have a .scr script that is in the same location. (Sits on a NAS). Two RHEL computers try to run this script. Same location same attributes because it is the SAME file in the same shared location.
 One computer executes it fine. The other says &quot;unable to execute&quot; (even as root)
 I have check the fstab file and the mount is the same. Both do not have firewall enabled. What is blocking one computer from executing scripts? Is there a place to check if the overall file system has a noexec? Because looking at both computers theirs are similar.
 Thoughts

                              <span>I have some interviews for some companies that I applied to a few weeks ago. I got laid off last week.
 Should you disclose this? I did hear how unemployed people struggle to get jobs. I have not updated my resume or LinkedIn with this yet.
 Would they find out during a background check?
 If they ask when you can start, what should you say?

 They have same settings on the switch, same VLANS, 
 Old server has only one NIC and new HP has 2 NICs in TEAM - tried separated as well.
 ​
 Do you have any ideas where to start to look?
 tried:
 - Cables
 - doblechecked Switch config
 - Windows logs
 - Performance - load is low - 90%+ resources free

                              <span>Greetings all!
 We have a b2b direct connect setup with another tenant (both sides), and until recently it worked fine, we could create shared channels and upload files there and sync those files to devices using the sync option.
 But since a few days ago (maybe even before, not a lot of people use this option and edit the files online) users from the other tenant (and ours on their shared channels) started having issues with syncing files from a shared teams channel to their pc.
 They can access and work on the files in the browser or through teams, but can&#x27;t sync the files to their pc, they either get an error that says: &quot;sorry onedrive can&#x27;t add your folder right now, you might not have permissions to this folder, or it may belong to another organization&quot;, or when they click sync (either from teams or from the sharepoint site it self, it doesn&#x27;t matter) it starts the onedrive app, flashes a blank window and closes the window, and nothing happens.
 What is the issue here? we didn&#x27;t change anything on the tenant or shared channel setup, it just stopped working. We tried it from both sides and its the same issue. Did the direct connect mess up somehow? is it a onedrive app issue? We tried all the usual stuff like reinstalling the onedrive app to the latest version, cleaning the cache, even new installs of windows, we tried different users and new/old groups/channels. I&#x27;ve opened a support ticket with microsoft, but thought someone here maybe had the same issue and managed to sort it?
 Any advice would be extremely helpful!
 (also sorry if i opened this topic in the wrong reddit site, feel free to point me in the right direction :D)

 Also, when I try to import IIS 6.2 settings from 2012 to the IIS 2019 server using Shared Config the sites goes away and I dont see anything after reopening IIS. I checked the Management and WPSVC services and they were running. 
 TIA.

                              <span>Hello,
 For some reason, registry settings I configure on a Windows 10 PC are repeatedly restored by default. To be specific, the parameters we configure are AutoAdminLogon and the credentials for the user. The goal is to have a local account automatically login upon reboot of the computer. However, these settings keeps getting cleared by themselves. I&#x27;ve been looking at GPOs but can not find anything there. 
 Can someone provide some advice for troubleshooting?

 Have you ever achieved installing quick assist on Windows Server 2019? We’ve managed to install it yet it won’t launch..

 The goal: Print black labels with white text using my Zebra GX430t.
 The problem: I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to do this using Zebra Designer 3 free version. The solution using Zebra Designer 2 is not very good.
 The details:
 I have a Zebra GX430t with 76x127mm direct thermal labels. I am able to print perfectly well using the Zebra Designer 3 software by adding black text, objects etc. These print absolutely fine. What I want to do is to print exactly the same kinds of labels but with white text on black background rather than black text on white background. The labels will be used for presentation purposes on a black product so they need to match grap…</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 We&#x27;ve been using Gravityzone endpoint for the past month now. A common alert we see on reports are PST trojan alerts. The trouble is it occasionally deletes the users entire PST file, and of course most don&#x27;t know how to check their quarantine despite being shown how to many times...
 Is it worth turning off scanning of email archives? I only use webmail myself, and most of the spam filtering should be done by Google first before arriving in Outlook, so I doubt this is a feature our users will need.

                              <span>Hey all,
 If you&#x27;re managing a large number of Azure-joined devices, you&#x27;re probably well aware that manually enrolling each one into Intune can be quite time-consuming. To streamline this process, I&#x27;ve put together a PowerShell script that automates it.
 Here&#x27;s an overview of the script&#x27;s functions:
 Creates an MDM Key: The script generates an MDM key if it doesn&#x27;t already exist.
 Enables Automatic MDM Enrollment: It sets up automatic MDM enrollment using Azure AD credentials.
 Generates Necessary Registry Keys: These keys are essential for the enrollment process.
 Initiates Group Policy Update: It forces a group policy update using the gpupdate /force command.
 Defines Enrollment URLs: The script assigns the required MDM enrollment URLs.
 Automates Device Enrollment: It calls upon deviceenroller.exe to automatically enroll the device in MDM.
 You can find the full script here: https://github.com/fKryptek/Intune/blob/main/EnrollToIntune.ps1
 As with any script you find online, I highly recommend reviewing it, tailoring it to your needs, and testing it within a controlled environment before deploying it on a larger scale.
 I&#x27;m interested in hearing about your experiences with the script, as well as any modifications or improvements you might suggest. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please let me know.
 Looking forward to your feedback.
 If you&#x27;d like to buy me a coffee for my efforts : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bobbyhalford
 P.S.: Keep in mind, the effectiveness of this script may vary based on your Azure AD and Intune setup. Always customize and test in your own environment.

                              <span>Hi all, I have a weird issue, it seems some patch CU or other mitigation for Exchange 2016 has made a change to the SELF security on its computer object in Active Directory.
 The issue we have is SELF does not have rights to read or “write to personal information “ Which stops the correct enrolment of MDE as it needs to write a certificate to the personal store on the server. 
 Anyone else have this issue or would mind checking perms on their computer account object see if the default view has more than “change password” and “special”
 I want to change the perms but don’t want to bork the server. 
 My lab server has has normal permissions to SELF such as “Create All Child Objects” “Delete all child objects” “validate write to DNS host name” “read personal information “ “write personal information” “special”
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks.

It said “DMARC is not set up.” Thinking I might have made a mistake I redid my DMARC record entry and I waited 48 hours. It said the same thing when I checked again.
 I used Dmarcian ( https://dmarcian.com/domain-checker/ ) and a few other checkers and it said my domain is valid. I believe Dmarcian is correct and Google Admin Toolbox is wrong. Check for yourself with any random domain. Anyone know what is wrong with Google Admin Toolbox?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Picked up a new envornment in the last 6 months and trying to understand why we have a fair amount of CPU resource avaiable, but still high CPU ready times in our Preprod resource pool. I THINK it&#x27;s due to how our resource pools are configured but not 100% sure.
 We have 2 resource pools: Prod and Preprod.
 Screenshots on how they&#x27;re setup: https://imgur.com/a/k62Po8S
 What I THINK is going on: 
 Although we have &quot;enough&quot; CPU resources within the cluster, because preprod is set to low, it&#x27;ll never be able to contend with prod.
 However, if I set Prod to High, and Preprod to Normal.. I&#x27;ll still have a 1:2 ratio of 4000 to 8000..
 So I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;ll solve my problem?
 I&#x27;m also not sure if I should set a CPU reservation / limit closer to what the actual usage is?

 I would like to implement a rule that regulates the users profile, which should be universal for every user.
 For e.g. is \\Fileserver\FolderRedirect\%userprofile%\* working?
 Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>So I work for multiple schools and use Autotask so staff and students can log tickets. I have been encouraging everyone to log tickets but I usually end up with titles like 
 “Laptop not working”
 “A teacher needs access to a share”
 It’s great that they are logging a ticket but how can I help them be more descriptive and perhaps mention the troubleshooting they have already tried? What are you guys doing that makes logging tickets less of a hassle for your end users?

                              <span>Hey guys, got a quick question here. I added a Weblink as an App in Intune and on a Surface I can see it in the Portal App and install it through there. But for the mobile devices (Android and iOS) the link just doesn&#x27;t show up. I selected &quot;yes&quot; for show this as a featured app in the company portal, but on the phones it doesn&#x27;t appear. Any ideas why? I assigned it to our MDM group as available for enrolled devices. What the hell am I missing? Thanks in advance and if you need more information, just ask.

 With all of the SaaS systems, other integrations, links and what not it is hard to keep track on what is connected to what.
 Is there anyone who knows a good software or service to keep records of the made connections?
 I would like to have some sort of dashboard/view that can show me what is connected to lets say azure or even to the local AD, it doesn&#x27;t have to generate it automatically, i can add it any time i implement a connection, link or service.

 In a brand new infrastructure and having all resources you want, would you go for ADD exclusively or would you mix it up with on prem? And why?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering that I can use Dism command to enable Windows feature Hyper-V Hypervisor only?
 Because I try to run Windows command:
 Dism /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor 
 It&#x27;s showing the error message about it&#x27;s required dependency features from Microsoft-Hyper-V
 If I run Windows command:
 Dism /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V 
 It installed all Hyper-V Hypervisor features successfully.
 However, I want to install Hyper-V Hypervisor feature only and if I enabled via GUI it also installed Hyper-V Hypervisor successfully.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been using Lansweeper for 5 years now, apart from the Helpdesk lacking many features and possibilitys and the mail notifications being a bit unreliable, it did it&#x27;s job for a relatively low price. Asset Management was also not the greatest, but it was on Premise and again, did it&#x27;s job &quot;good enough&quot;. Deployments were always a bit messy. 
 With the recent changes Lansweeper made to their licensing structure, we are definately not going to pay premium for a Cloud Solution that doesn&#x27;t do much better in the other reagards. 
 So basically: Are there any alternatives? 
 Price doesn&#x27;t play that much of a role anymore, things have changed considerably and the IT-Budget got a pretty heavy bump (although it&#x27;s still not absolutely massive and we are still only 4 people in the Team, so it has to be something that&#x27;s relatively easy to learn...)
 Main point is: It has to be On-Prem. ITAM with connected Helpdesk would be something very nice as well. All i have found was ManageEngine, but i&#x27;ve not found any user stories about it :D 
 Any help would be appriciented - thanks! :)

                              <span>Hey sorry if this is a dumb question, still learning and the previous posts on the topic seem a little outdated (8+ years old).
 I&#x27;m having trouble understanding the benefits of SFTP over something like transfer via HTTPS to an s3 bucket. With s3 we can have multipart file transfers up to 5TB over TLS 1.2/3, and manage auth with iam + sigv4.
 I&#x27;m wondering what benefits SFTP provides/why is it used today other than historical/legal reasons. Is SSH more secure than TLS 1.3? Is ssh based file transfer faster?
 Again, sorry if this is dumb,
 Thanks

                              <span>Say your organization is multi-cloud, or in a single cloud provider with considerations to go multi-cloud.
 What are your present day criteria to determine where you&#x27;ll place a new workload? For example:
  
Which cloud provider and which region? What are the metrics or drivers that will motivate you to consider more than one provider? Or a new region within the same provider?
 Is the proverbial &quot;we always want the cheapest&quot; criterion still dominant in your decision-making strategy?
 What will deter you from using a pre-existing region or a cloud provider, other than survivability and site reliability? Is it capacity or bandwidth, or could it be latency?
 Other than the age-old &quot;proximity to the edge&quot; or &quot;proximity to the end users&quot; that were dominant factors a few years ago, are there new emerging considerations that you&#x27;re applying lately when deciding where to put a new sizable footprint?
  
I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll think about greenfield (brand new project, no restrictions) vs brownfield (where this new workload has to coexist and work together with legacy infrastructure). If your analysis is made simpler by considering a branny-new slate for a new project, how would you approach it?

                              <span>I have a Linux hypervisor with 3+ NICs. I also have a bunch of /32 static routes and local virtual interfaces with /32 routes. 
 ​
 For example, here is the route 
 10.20.75.74 dev cali946e04a3b83 scope link 
 &quot;ip route get&quot; for that particular IP shows the &quot;src&quot; as the IP of a NIC that is not the default route: 
 root@coke34:~# ip route get 10.20.75.74 10.20.75.74 dev cali946e04a3b83 src 192.168.51.200 uid 0 cache

                              <span>Hello everybody. I would like to know if anyone has already configured this switch model via CLI. I don&#x27;t have much experience with this equipment and hiring a specialist is out of the question. When connecting a Dell R720 server directly to the switch, with 10G fiber ports, there is no network traffic.The scenario is as follows: Dell R720 (NIC: Intel(R) 10G 2P X520 Adapter) + Dell R640 (NIC 1: BRCM 10G/GbE 2+2P 57800 rNDC) connected to Dell S4128F. In the image you can see the active server connections on ports 13, 14, 15 and 16, on port 25 a DAC cable is connected to another Dell S4128F (redundancy) and on port 27 a 1Gbps cable is connected to interconnect with a Dell 6248 (legacy network). Basically I need these servers to have a 10G network working.Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi fellas
 I was searching info about network regionalization or in other words, how to split a multi vendor topology into defined domains per vendor. The FMO or final picture is SR-MPLS with flex-algo and TE.
 I need your opinions based on your experience or criteria about how do you will split and make those domains.My main concern its how do I made the peerings between domains. Should I use eBGP? BGP Confederation?? Bear in mind that the current topology has all PEs with an iBGP peering against a pair of route reflectors
 This is the current topology:
 Current
 This is what we are analizing:
 Future

                              <span>Hey All, 
 Long time lurker, first time posting. 
 I&#x27;ve got a bit of a situation that I thought I had a solution to, but am now stumped. Please excuse any ignorance or lack of detail. 
 The scenario is, we&#x27;ve got a location that just had a 3rd party install a Fortigate FW needed for remote access to their devices. Said firewall needs direct internet access. Normally this vendor would use an LTE device to accomplish this, but the location is out in the boonies and service sucks, so that option is out the window. 
 Our current ISP has a Ciena fiber hand off with two 1 gbe ports (will come back to why this is relevant), one of which is being used to connect to our firewall for Internet access. The demarc for this fiber circuit is in a separate building from where the 3rd party Fortigate fw is located. The two buildings are connected via mm fiber and use Brocade/Ruckus switches. 
 My initial thought was to run a link from the open port in the handoff, to our switch in an access port with a newly created vlan in building one, and trunk the vlan across the network to building two where the Fortigate is located (access port again) and assign the interface on the Fortigate one of the IP&#x27;s from our block. Well, that was the plan until I just got off the phone with our ISP, where the indicated that that open port is actually for an entirely new circuit that we would have to add to our account. So, I&#x27;m back to the drawing board. 
 As I eluded to early, we do have a block of IP&#x27;s (/29) that we can use so I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a solution, but I&#x27;m not sure how to achieve that. While I was only the phone with the ISP, they also indicated that in order to use that block, I&#x27;d have to have a L3 device to handle the routing of said block. I don&#x27;t think leadership will agree to purchasing any equipment for this as things have been extremely tight. 
 Apologies if this is all over the place, it&#x27;s been a hell of a day, and not just for the problem above. 
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi guys. My company will be having a new ISP line installed at a new site and I was shown what the IP details were by my colleague. I&#x27;m quite confused! This is my first time being involved in this sort of stuff so I&#x27;m trying to understand as much as I can.
 In our other offices we have ISP circuits where we have been given a /29 IP range and we just assign the IP of our firewalls from this range and point the default gateway to that of the ISP router so it is a lot simpler.
 Now it&#x27;s LAN IPs and WAN IPs and I&#x27;ve no idea how they relate to our current setup which is:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) &gt; L2 switch &gt; ISP router
 I know we need a router that will point all traffic to the ISP default gateway, that much is clear. There is a /29 range for the LAN side and a /30 for the WAN side.
 The way I see it is that we have to use 2 IPs from the /29 for the firewalls and another IP for the router interface facing the firewall. Then from the /30 range another router interface (pointing to the ISP router) will be configured with an IP and then a default route will point to the ISP&#x27;s default gateway.
 I think that our setup will then be:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) &gt; L2 switch (ISP failover) &gt; Router &gt; ISP router
 Am I on the right track with this or am I completely misunderstanding?

So, someone could break into the device, extract the machine certificate, then install it on another device and use it for unauthorized access.
 What mitigations exists to prevent this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been struggling to bring up Private Peering on an ExpressRoute circuit delivered via Zayo. I&#x27;ve dug around for examples configuring this on a Nexus 9K and I&#x27;ve pieced a few things together, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get a BGP session up. I appreciate any insight you might share.
 On my side I have 1G service delivered from Zayo into an eth port on a Nexus C93180YC-FX running NXOS 9.3(10). Zayo indicated that I should use QinQ and they&#x27;re delivering the primary on VLAN A, secondary on VLAN B.
 My QinQ-fu isn&#x27;t strong but at a high level my understanding is that I should be receiving S-tags A and B and using C-tag C, which is what I&#x27;ve configured for VLAN ID in Azure. Do I have that backwards? Microsoft&#x27;s routing examples, though for IOS-XE, seem to indicate the reverse.
 I am consulting this article for configuring QinQ on the 9K.
 My issue is that all of the documentation I&#x27;m reading is around multiple inner tags with one outer tag. I believe I need the reverse. I&#x27;ve tried both the Configuring VLAN Mapping for Selective Q-in-Q on a 802.1Q Tunnel Port and Configuring Selective Q-in-Q with Multiple provider VLANs examples. I enter the first VLAN mapping switchport vlan mapping vlan-id-range dot1q-tunnel outer vlan-id and when I try to enter a second mapping with the same inner VLAN ID I receive an error about a conflicting mapping for the inner VLAN already existing on this port.
 Other info:
 I tried a configuration with just the primary to see if I could get BGP peering but nothing is coming up.

                              <span>Hello experts
 I&#x27;m looking to do a breakout from a 400Gbps connection to multiple 25Gbps connections. Is this possible? If not, what are my other options?
 It seems that 400Gbps supports breakout only to 4x100Gbps ( https://community.fs.com/news/400g-qsfp-dd-solution-for-400g-data-center-interconnect.html ) . Is that right ? or I can somehow split 100Gbps further ?

                              <span>I work for a mid-size engineering firm, ~1000 employees. IT recently announced they&#x27;d upgraded the core system from 1 to 2.5Gbps. Unfortunately, it would only be rolled out to individual users based on documented need or general age upgrades (i.e., all new computers will have a 2.5G NICS, but they won&#x27;t upgrade current computers). I am not due for an upgrade for a few years, and I won&#x27;t be able to justify a &quot;need&quot; for the faster connection. But I want it.
 Current setup: Wall -&gt; VOIP phone (RJ45, 1G) VOIP phone -&gt; hub monitor (RJ45, 1G) Hub monitor -&gt; Laptop (USB-C) Hub monitor -&gt; 2nd monitor (DP pass)
 Laptop also has a 1G RJ45, and a second identical USB-C port.
 I think I need a new hub, but I can&#x27;t find a product. Does this product exist: * RJ45 in (2.5Gbps or higher) * RJ45 out (for phone) * USB-C to computer (network and monitor) * USB-C to monitor (displayport passthrough)
 Power supply from the hub isn&#x27;t needed. I may be willing to omit the RJ45 out to the phone and just forward it to my cell.

                              <span>Hello, curious if anybody has an idea what could be causing the following error that I am seeing in the logs of our 9000 series Cisco switches:
 ​
 Examples (from different Switches):
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 5 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 F0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 ​
 This log pops up after a reboot in about 50% of the 300 or so C9000 Switches that I have polled so far. All Switches are running 17.03.05. A few have been upgraded to 17.06.05 for testing but the log error is apparent in both versions. So far, I have polled C9200-24T, C9200-24P, C9200-48P, C9200-48T and C9300-48Ps. All models show the log. Some are standalone switches, some are stacks with up to 8 switches.
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 which is then connected to my router. 
 ​
 Since I got this switch connected to my router I have been having issues accessing my router page and sometimes the devices don&#x27;t show up on my router. When they do show up the camera is not listed. I can still see my devices on blue iris which doesn&#x27;t see my camera.

 My cables are all CAT6 what am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Recently my organization had a minor debate about bandwidth; our ISP supplies a 1GB Fiber connection to our site. We have multiple VLANs and a fallback ISP with crossover, etc. The debate was about having several 50&quot; T.V.s streaming something constantly if this would cause a dramatic decline in LAN service. Let&#x27;s put a number of five (5) TVs.
 Some of our personnel are worried about internet-specific bandwidth. I recommended that we downgrade the stream quality to preserve bandwidth but limit each TV to 5Mbs max. Obviously, that is going to be 20Mpbs out of 1000Mbp. At max out usage is about 80Mbps at peak times. Meaning there is quite a bit of headway.
 My argument was LAN Bandwidth; we have servers/services/non-internet devices that are networked together. Let&#x27;s say we take a generic 100…</span>

 PS: I tried searching this on Google but since I have no idea what I am searching for I do not trust those results.

                              <span>Hey,
 So I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my chances of applying for Network Engineer role (again).
 My situation is kind of different from the ‘normal’ network engineer career path. 
 I had started as a junior network engineer as my first IT job(i got quite lucky) then after 3years of experience i got my CCNA certification. But due to a position limit for network engineer at our company my manager had asked me to change to Helpdesk engineer since we were lacking in that area. So now i have just over a year of experience in helpdesk as of now.
 Currently i am working towards my CCNP but i would like to ask what are my chances of getting a job back in as a network engineer? Since normally people go from helpdesk to network engineer. Will this be effect my chances of going back to network engineer?
 Any feedback on my chances and what i can do to improve my chances will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>How much does it cost to run a CGNAT setup for 1,000 subscribers? Can you do this without licensing somehow? Is there some way of just running this on a server?
 Appreciate any advice - thank you!

                              <span>I’ve been in the Marine Corps Reserve as a Sys admin for 8 years now. During the majority of this time I’ve been operating heavy equipment for my civilian job, its pretty good money between 80k-100k a year depending on how much over time I chose to work. During this time I’ve accumulated bills like a house, wife, car, ect… in my military career I’ve gone over seas 3 times totaling about 2 years and some change of time spent in country working as a sys admin. This last deployment I really decided I wanted to pursue IT as a career. While deployed I got my Sec+ and started looking for jobs back home in the Chicago area. I’m struggling to find a job that pays enough to support my wife and current living expenses. I am willing to take a small pay cut to get started in the industry. I guess my question is does anyone have any guidance on how to proceed or what I should do. 
 Note: I absolutely hate my current job. 
 And I still have an active security clearance if that helps

 I went to university 10 years ago for Mechanical engineering and I dropped out 2 years later to pursue a career in Aviation. 
 I worked 2-3 odd jobs at once for several years and paid my Pilot school and became a Commercial Aircraft Pilot. Once I got my license, I started my instructor training to become a flight instructor and that’s when COVID happened.

                              <span>So I had a company reach out to me after viewing my resume and gave me the song and dance stating they felt I would be an amazing fit, my experience is exactly what they need, blah blah blah.
 The job was for a systems engineering/architect position 
 In the email they told me to select three days that would be good to interview and a bit more about what I do.
 I responded and sent the days they were asking for a went into more detail about my job, related tasks, but kept it quite brief so to save the rest for the interview.
 Well the first day I put on there was for yesterday and I heard nothing, so I sent a follow up email asking if the interview was still occurring and the day ends with me still hearing nothing.
 So I looked up the company the following day again to make sure it is a legitimate company, which it is, just to make sure I wasn’t getting messed with.
 Why ask to interview me just to ghost me and not have the decency to at least tell me something.
 The job market is tough enough as is for most people, companies that do this do not make things any better.
 Is this common?

 Really seems like it&#x27;s been going WAY downhill with barracuda the last couple weeks. Also was notified today &quot;oops we might have blocked everything today, so uh, go through that mess manually&quot;
 If you are coming up on a renewal, I&#x27;d strongly look at alternatives. Mimecast and proofpoint look viable but I haven&#x27;t started digging way in yet.

                              <span>What was the best excuse you have come up with for not going into work? For me, it was &quot;I quit 2 weeks ago. I am NEVER coming in again.&quot;
 Anyhow, in another group this was asked and I had to laugh when someone wrote this as the reason that they were not coming into work:
 &quot;Sorry boss these past couple days have been quite explosive. I&#x27;ll spare you the details but it&#x27;s a complete disaster. Like lava coming out of places you don&#x27;t want it to come out of. It has unfortunately affected my ability to work the past 48 hours but seems to be improving. I&#x27;ll keep you posted. Thank you&quot;

 Yeah, they have a very good excuse, don&#x27;t you agree?

 There&#x27;s also this new &#x27;Dev Drive&#x27; available in the store to try out, and a bunch of other things like a more native GitHub integration and co-pilot.
 Oh yeah and Windows Store apps will now finally incorporate the feature Windows Phone had and have native backup/restore functionality, so that switching PC&#x27;s requires less preference reconfiguration.

                              <span>Hello all,My company is on the way to complete the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process. One open and hotly discussed point is the logging issue.I am a big friend of &quot;GrayLog&quot; which we have been using for a long time in the free version. However, our IT security officer says that a protection against manipulation of the log events cannot be guaranteed. The product variant &quot;GRAYLOG SECURITY&quot; would fulfill this requirement, but due to the licensing of the complete Elasticsearch stack with the machine learning features and the &quot;top-notch-enterprise&quot; requirements on the base system (Oracle DB etc.) this is unfortunately too expensive for us.I found this method on the net to write a signature in each event and validate it again on readout (https://community.graylog.org/t/graylog-for-integrity-log-hashing/15570), however this is obviously not enough as a user with admin rights could easily manipulate these hashes.Has anyone ever done the GRAYLOG FREE task as ISO/IEC 27001 compliant logging and can give me some hints on how to implement this?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Some people here may understand the situation we&#x27;re in.
 Basically, we have singular users working in remote parts of the UK (literally miles from the nearest mobile tower), where mobile dongles/sim hubs just do not work. The users have relatively low bandwidth usage, they mainly use SharePoint for Word and Excel collaboration, possibly some infrequent Teams calls. 
 We&#x27;ve had quotes in the past for installing leased lines (far too expensive and takes far too long for the cable to be laid; 3-6 months for a 12 month project) 
 Basically, we&#x27;ve tested StarLink (the standard residential edition) and it&#x27;s an absolute godsend. It&#x27;s relieved such a massive headache for the onsite user and from me from a sysadmin perspective. 
 We don&#x27;t need the business edition, it&#x27;s far too expensive (£2400 for the kit and £240 p/m) and we don&#x27;t need the bandwidth or speeds. It&#x27;s literally 1 person in a cabin working from 1 PC...
 Should we continue down this road or do you think we could encounter issues in the future using the residential service? I do feel it&#x27;s slightly amoral? 
 Thanks guys

                              <span>TOTP is something that can be self-hosted. Completely vendor-neutral.
 The TOTP &quot;server&quot; could be self-hosted, and users could be told to use Google Authenticator, Authy, etc. If banks didn&#x27;t want to do that, they could build a TOTP client in a day into their apps.
 Why is it that if a bank supports TOTP, it seems they can only do phone or email authentication? 
 AND, for apps on my phone that require passwords but log me out periodically (CHASE), it would be great to see in the app a warning for days left in session. I didn&#x27;t always keep a copy of my password database in my phone, and so I could be across the country and suddenly be locked out of my bank accounts.
 TLDR - Bank 2FA seems to blow, with no indication as to why, and their session management also sucks.
 If anyone has insight, let me know. I figure this is appropriate for /r/sysadmin because I have been in the field and wonder what is holding the security teams back from doing things correctly at these institutions.

                              <span>I see a lot of sentimentality in this sub around the idea that technicians and engineers who have strong skillsets and problem solving are good at their jobs. However, I see a lot of folks who hate their users, and celebrate &quot;bringing down Shirley&quot; for whatever sleight they suffered from her etc.
 I wanted to broach the subject of what being Good at your Job in IT actually should look like, and why being very skilled doesn&#x27;t automatically make you good at your job.
 Our entire industry is a service industry. Even our engineers, are working in service to other departments in some fashion. Outside of maybe the deepest depths of DevOps, our sector is mostly customer (users are interchangeable with customers for internal departments) service oriented.

 I have created a case at Duo support, but they haven&#x27;t responded back, so i figured id try my luck here, maybe someone already done the migration

                              <span>TL/DR: Foster kid’s charity collecting laptops to rebuild for foster kids, tax write off given for computer donations 
 Hi folks, 
 I replied to a post here a while ago about how I collect laptops and rebuild them for foster kids and families in Denver, Colorado, USA. I had a lot of private messages sent to me asking how to help but haven’t been able to post till now. 
 I have been in IT officially for about 6 years now and after I had one foster child who kept punching my laptop when he got mad at a game, I thought that maybe other foster families had this same issue and needed a repaired laptop or a laptop for the kids. I worked with my office building and started collecting any desktop/laptops that were in the basement Tom be recycled, made about 100 systems - then the pandemic hit and the demand went up. 
 I’ve been able to rebuild about 400+ laptops on my own (windows, Mac, a few Ubuntu set ups) and distribute them - but we’re running low and the need keeps growing. 
 If anyone wants to unload systems for tax credit through a registered 501c3, we can accept donations and send you a blank form for tax write offs, and even make a post thanking you on linked in for free marketing. The goal is that you and your company win, and the kids win. 
 Though I expose my identity a bit doing this, here is a LinkedIn link where you can search the history of this charity I run and who I partner with to know it’s legit.

 No pressure, but if you can help, there are lots of foster kids and families in our area who could use these!

                              <span>Ran into an issue I&#x27;ve not experienced in Autopilot today. When using the latest &quot;Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -Online&quot;, I eventually got the &quot;806 - ZtdDeviceAlreadyAssigned&quot; error. No big deal, dummy me did a typo on the serial number. Well, I went through Intune Enrollment and also verified in MS4B that this device serial number does not exist. Looking in AAD, it also verifies the device is in Autopilot but I cannot find it to assign a new tag to the device. 
 Since the device hash is clearly registered but cannot find it from the serial number (and no the mobo hasn&#x27;t been replaced), how can I find the device to assign the necessary group tag?

                              <span>so we are migrating our dns from current provider (oracle\dyn) to Amazon Route 53 and I have questions.
 testing our first move, on one site we decreased the TTL on the oracle\dyn side, and set it low on Amazon side. so do we then go to our domain host and add the amazon dns servers, or do we instead remove dyndns and THEN add amazon once we see the TTL updated? IPs are not changing at all, just moving the DNS.

The course does not announce these cancellations, instead they make customers check back with their calendar on their website. My question is, would anyone know of a way to continuously scan this website&#x27;s calendar to look for open tee times?

                              <span>I tried searching but I didn&#x27;t find the correct answer or didn&#x27;t use the quite terms. I am trying to tighten up our domain admin accounts.
 I am trying to implement so that separate admin accounts can promote themselves to Domain Admin when they need it temporarily. Is there is a way to do this?
 Or is the best way to create a master domain account locked down to only login into the DCs that perhaps the IT manager could promote the account or maybe do the domain admin task required.
 ​
 Thanks for any advice.

                              <span>Hi All, I am trying to fix the mess the previous admin created by enabling Bitlocker on machines manually via local gpo and not recording it anywhere. And guess what, the recovery keys are not in AD but in a spreadsheet (no, not password protected). 
 Does anyone have a script that would report on all machines in a domain that have Bitlocker enabled? I have been testing a few I found online but none of them works.
 Thank you in advance.

Itwould be nice if they are open source projects.

 I searched on Google without finding an answer to my problem.
 I have a traefik running on a docker compose that has an ip in 192.168.20.34 and I want to redirect the traffic from blabla.fr to a machine in 192.168.20.130. I can&#x27;t figure out how to set up the traefik so that it works. For my other apps that run under docker-compose and that are on the same machine everything works perfectly

Also the &quot;-Identity FSMO-DC&quot; is that the old master I presume? So it should be &quot;-Identity AD-1&quot;? Does it look like I&#x27;m missing anything from this?

                              <span>I recently took a new job at a place and I’m completely overwhelmed. Old IT guy set up local accounts on all the computers. They’re not joined to a domain and he has everyone’s passwords written down. There’s no ticketing system. No group policy. No system images. No software deployment tools. No standard computer that they’re ordering, just whatever seems good on Amazon. No naming convention for devices. He’s got users in AD for their email address but besides that, pretty much nothing.
 I’m trying to take a deep breath on this stuff as I know these changes take time, but I’m not used to an overhaul like this. My gauge in the company is that they aren’t going to want to spend money to make changes because it has “worked” for this long. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should prioritize and approach this?

 https://northwave-cybersecurity.com/threat-intel-research/analysis-of-new-active-malware-mediaarena-pua
 We have several hundred machines in our environment that we confirmed have it installed and we are trying to find a way to remove it. I&#x27;ve drilled down into the registry and found the uninstall string but the one it lists basically just deletes the key.
 cmd.exe /c reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\PDFPower /f
 Has anyone found a better way to uninstall it via script? As I&#x27;m not confident that actually uninstalls the app and it just removes it from being listed in the registry and programs/features.
 If you&#x27;re dealing with this you&#x27;re aware is sets your default search engine to one their own (AASearchpoweronline). Is resetting edge settings enough to fix that?

 Any help would be appreciated as everything I find online and tried is not allowing me to make folders not read only.

                              <span>hey folks, 
 i am getting pretty frustrated with this, i have built a small lab env with a domain controller that is acting as a DNS server .
 i am trying t o manually add a DNS record in the forward lookup zone for a linux machine , which is not joined into the domain . 
 ​
 pretty straight forward i want the hostname to be resolved to that static IP however , adding a New Host always assumes that i want to add a FQDN for that machine . which in my case isn&#x27;t i just want to add machine called Linux1
 ​
 I tried and created a new FLZ named only Linux1 and then added a new entry and left the name blank so it inherited the domain name which is Linux1.
 But still no Luck , when i try to ping Linux1
 ​
 Ping request could not find host Linux1 .Please check the name and try again.
 ​
 Any help would be appreciated

 Edit: appears this might be Zscaler ZIA related! Try disabling the service and seeing if your response times return to some normality.

 What should I expect and are there any common mistakes I should avoid? Or just anything in general that might help me. They seem really excited to have me come in and the job offer is already on the table, I&#x27;m just scared that I&#x27;ll mess it up.
 Thank you :)

Yesterday we received an email about software problems in our Polish site, where the software used to control machine equipment in our factory &quot;crashed&quot; several times during the last week. I put crashed between &quot;&quot; because they listed various complaints under the word &#x27;crashed&#x27;, including computers freezing up and computers supposedly rebooting on their own. The communication is a bit hard since they do sometimes use Google Translate when English becomes too hard. 
 The software runs on a server and the desktop computers, all Windows 10, connect to the server using the installed WinCC application on them. The computers were recently updated to version 22H2 right around the time the issues started to occur more frequently, but after talking with the people onsite this problems has bee…</span>

 I am looking to automate our laptop/PC deployment a bit. Atm Im manually configuring our laptops (all Windows) which is rather something I know I could automate. 
 What&#x27;s ur recommendation of grasping this if we&#x27;re using G Suite with a GCPW? Is anyone in the same boat? Should we consider migrating to O365 for ease of things like this? Thanks.

 Effectively I want to simulate accepting a meeting invitation, so that it schedules the meeting in both my Teams and Outlook calendars (assuming I haven&#x27;t been emailed a meeting invitation and am unable to get the organiser to do so).
 Or is this not possible?

                              <span>i dont know what physics or engineering term would desribe a scenario whereby no matter what input you give a machine the output will always be the same or wont increase.
 I think have reached that point or about to reach that point where you no longer care about working extra hard, pleasing users and execs, going the extra mile, being innovative etc 
 Reason? it seems like my efforts are not recognised and rewarded 
 To be frank if i start working according to my job description now i will be seen as slacking because i have normalized working extra hard and going the extra mile since day one, taking calls on weekends, after hours, lucnh time etc, speedy resolution of issues (its now 3 and a half years now as helpdesk IT technician)
 To be fair as well i have not increased qualifications on paper but i have upskilled on the job and taken up extra tasks which were not initially on my job description -specifically im now somewhat of a lite system admin because i have been opened to some administration tasks and given rights to several systems 
 The companies, systems and users to support has grown a lot in the past 3 years and the parent company is on track to launch new companies who we will all support 
 Still the paycheck is the same as it was 3 years ago.

                              <span>Hola,
 I own an business on Fiverr, however, I have a big problem, the managers who reply to the clients (based in Phillipines) that are logged into my account can delete the whole account!
 I am trying to figure out the best way to make it so that they cannot access certain sensitive pages, such as ‘analytics’, ‘gigs’, ‘settings’, etc.
 I am tech savvy but I have absolutely no clue the best way to do this? I was thinking about a virtual desktop service where they log in to a user, and that computer has some great programming that blocks those URLS, but that may be a bit glitchy, i’m not sure.
 I need advice on the best way to do this? 
 Thank you,
 Harry

                              <span>In my previous place of work we have a few sets of Yealink conference solutions and the CPW90 works really well and versatile. Where I&#x27;m at now uses those Surface Hub look-alikes and their built in microphone sucks. Management refuse to implement an actual microphone solution and just blame the bad audio on f/w and this and that.
 I looked around and I have never seen anyone tried/done that, connecting a CPW90 to a PC. Does anyone here had any experience?
 I am thinking if a generic DECT receiver / base station will be compatible with it.
 Or, does anyone has recommendations for products with similar form factor (1 base station, 2 wireless microphones, similar price tag is a big plus)

 Out of about 400 applications we interviewed about 20. The 95% of applications that were left out simply had no mention of any particular skills that we needed. Some people mentioned knowing how office works while some knew how to install a pc.
 The 20 that we interviewed showed some promise in their application but when asked about their mentioned skills they went completely silent. We had people say they know how to install servers, manage vmware, m365, aws, ad, networks and general knowledge of IT. When interviewed though... absolutely no idea how to do any of those.

 Everything is in the title, I even tried to apply the new MS template instead of the legacy rule we had for that alert and still detects when internal users are added.
 https://i.postimg.cc/TY0KVt2p/image.png
 It detects that those users are in the External group, but they are not (I actually checked and there are no users with any of our domains). It started happening with no change on our part like 2-3 weeks ago.
 Any idea ?
 Thanks in advance !

 I&#x27;ve been doing desktop-come-everything support at my role (200ish global staff) for 3 and a half years so far, and am looking to get a decent payrise this time round. Did 5ish years helpdesk L1/L2 prior, am 30something years oldnow.
 My boss sent me an email this afternoon politely saying &#x27;I&#x27;d like to see you up your Azure training and get some certs&#x27;.
 ​
 Unfortunately, this is also after last week saying &#x27;What can we do to help you because I&#x27;m considering calling in outside help&#x27; because everyone&#x27;s started to pick up on my burnout.
 ​
 When I joined as desktop support, I was basically doing everything I was on the MSP side for these guys as helpdesk, plus it was now in person - so it was a sweet gig. 
 I started out on 60k NZD, then got bumped…</span>

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I&#x27;m a Sr.System Admin at University.
 We create an Azure AD account for students that serves as their email address, and SSO which allows login on public terminals in the library, access to various applications such as MS Office, PeopleSoft (student information system) etc.
 Students and Staff also bring their own devices to access all cloud-based SaaS products and applications on and off-campus
 On-campus Macs and PCs are managed using Azure Mobile Device Management (MDM). 
 My questions are:
 - Within the premise, students can connect their personal devices using wireless which only has internet access. Do you apply on the boarding checklist or MDM before granting access? We use SAML authentication.
 - Outside the premise, is it feasible to register thousands of devices into an MDM and implement a compliance checklist? Any tips and suggestions to apply to security measures to protect data and information?

 I have installed latest CU (2023-May) on my servers. 
 But , tenable is still reporting this vulnerability to us. 
 But , the MSQM service is still running on the servers and port 1801.
 I honestly thought patching will disable it after patching.
 Has anyone manually disabled MSMQ service and closed port 1801? Any issues afterward?

                              <span>Hi, 
 Not sure where to start. A bit of background, Our organisation uses office 365 for emails, teams, and excel. We save all our files onto Egnyte. 
 We have an excel spreadsheet with high level financial projections for project invoicing (45 projects) then we have a seperate excel for resourcing planning, and finally each project has 3 excels for document control management and project deliverables. All these are saved on Egnyte. 
 I’m looking to hire someone to create a digital data dashboard for each project to see the high level data in one place that’s currently spread across 100 excel sheets. I want to reduce the amount of manual data transfer and human error in data input between various seperate excel files duplicating the same data. 
 I understand a lot of this data might need aggregating into a dataset saved on the cloud and then additional applications used to process and present the data such as power bi but I do not know the order or priority of setting an outline brief for someone to price the work for our organisation. 
 Any help would be welcome. 
 I am open to radical changes in the way information is structured and push towards cloud based office 365.

                              <span>I ordered Vertical Cable keystone jacks off a recommendation from a site that are allegedly pros who install the same system as mine (ubiquiti), but ever since I installed them and patched in with pure copper patch cables, my system keeps intermittently dropping my APs randomly throughout the day. I checked the page for the keystone jacks, and come to find in the specs it says “gold plated brass connectors”… I’m not a professional or anything but I do know that connectors that are not pure copper can have issues carrying POE current (such as CCA)… I’m trying to figure out what the issue could be, and I’m wondering if the interface medium could be the culprit before I start tearing everything apart and ordering new stuff. I would assume these “ubiquiti pros” wouldn’t recommend a product that clearly doesn’t work with the POE powered APs, but stupider things have happened.

                              <span>This was a first for me... I get a ticket that BGP is down between two peers, which are connected by a carrier ethernet circuit. I can&#x27;t ping from one to the other, but both show the int is up/up. On the A side, I reset counters, and notice that my RX packets and bytes exactly matches my TX packets and bytes. Also odd, I see the A size in A&#x27;s LLDP neighbors table, showing in/out port to be the same. B side sees up/up, but BGP is down, and B can&#x27;t see anything from other side (no lldp either).
 Has anybody ever seen a carrier disconnect a circuit by making it loop back to itself? (Lumen, in this case)

                              <span>Is there any way to &quot;translate&quot; or &quot;map&quot; a device&#x27;s IP to a different IP in a L3 switch without NAT capabilities?
 My situation is: I&#x27;d like to avoid changing the device&#x27;s configuration and I need to connect several (about 30) devices with identical IPs configured, while having no IP conflicts and being able to access every individual device through HTTP.
 For example, have the &quot;192.168.1.1/24&quot; in port 1 become &quot;192.168.10.1/24&quot;, then have &quot;192.168.1.1/24&quot; in port 2 become &quot;192.168.10.2/24&quot; and so on... And then access the device in port &quot;n&quot; through &quot;192.168.10.n/24&quot; from another device, which would actually be correctly configured as &quot;192.168.10.40/24&quot;.
 Or maybe there&#x27;s a way to use the router&#x27;s NAT configs and VLANs somehow? But I don&#x27;t know if the fact that all the devices being configured in the same subnet would allow me to assign them to different VLANs, as far as I understand, each VLAN in a L3 switch should have a different subnet. I can&#x27;t picture it. Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t make sense. I know it&#x27;s not a typical use case but I figured I&#x27;d ask the experts.

                              <span>Greetings,
 This is a two part question.
 What would be a use case to have employees authenticate to AD before using company guest Wi-Fi services. I see some enterprises deploy two guest (no internal access) Wi-Fi services, one for guests and one for employees. I would like to know what benefit, other employee tracking, would be achieved by authenticating employees for guest Wi-Fi and opening the dmz to internal for this sake.
 The second question is whether any NAC product can authenticate guest Wi-Fi employee access locally via email confirmation sent to company email, I.e. by giving a temporary email only access during authentication so that the confirmation Code is received to the user on his corporate email. This is to avoid AD authentication and punching a hole from dmz to internal AD servers.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>There must be something simple I&#x27;m missing -- ideas are appreciated.
 I have three switches (QNAP, FS, and SuperMicro), each with SFP28 (25Gb) ports. The ports works fine for connecting to servers, both using DAC cables and fiber with transceivers.
 However, I am unable to get any two of the switches to connect to each other via SFP28 ports. The ports on both sides act like nothing is connected to the port. The switches do communicate fine via RJ45 ports.
 Any idea what I&#x27;m missing here? Seems like a really basic thing to do (using SFP28 ports for uplink).

                              <span>How do all.. The tittle says it all. I&#x27;m looking for a PoE inexpensive switch that supports 802.1qbg mode. Also known as VEPA, Reflective Relay, Hairpin and sometimes Edge Virtual Bridging. Preferably 10 or 12 ports and fanless.
 I&#x27;m coming up empty and my searching apparently sucks.
 For those curious this is to run MACVLAN in VEPA mode.

                              <span>Hey fellow network admins,
 I wanted to get some advice on an odd issue ive been running down for a while. 
 In short, I have a medical clinic with an older Xray machine with a Linux workstation. Basically getting a lot of TCP resend requests from this device when communicating with its local PACS server ( same location, both connected to the same switch). Further investigation with packet capture, I see at the point where it fails i get a TCP ZeroWindow reply from the Xray machine
 Its my understanding that the TCP window size should be negotiated between the 2 devices in the initial SYN, and should Match. However the Xray machine shows a window of 50000, and the Server its communicating with shows 64240 for the window size. 
 Is there a way on Server 2019 to set that window size? I found regfixes that were for server 2003, but did not work. I also turned off autotuning, no change. 
 The Xray machine is old, so I&#x27;m suspecting that&#x27;s what we are running into, but I wanted to confirm if I had any options to set this on my server side.

                              <span>Just asking to confirm.
 I want to do a config replace on all of our edge switches. The goal is to ensure consistency and make sure all the configs are the same. So going to make a golden config and push it out to all switches with a config replace.
 With doing this, there is no reason the switch needs to reboot, correct? Just want to make sure no one is going to lose connectivity when doing this.

I’m primarily an end user support tech but my company no longer has a network engineer so I’ve gotten to take up most of the projects they would be working on. I haven’t played around with networking topologies or just about anything except an Ethernet cable for the last few years. 
 My question is if I am installing ip cameras that will be powered with PoE should I be using 568A or 568B? I’ve looked up a few things online but nothing is super straight forward or giving me one linear answer. 
 Any help is massively appreciated!

                              <span>So I am trying to understand the benefit of VLANs and how they work still. Hopefully I can clearly and concisely explain my setup and confusion.
 In this example network topology, there is currently zero VLAN or network segmentation. We have one WAN feeding a Fortinet Firewall, with the Fortinet configured for DHCP relay pointing to a 2012 R2 server. This server only has one scope that all devices live in. The scope is 10.10.8.1/22 (but only handing IPs out from 10.10.8.10 - 10.10.9.248). Then the Fortinet is feeding a few miscellaneous switches that are essentially dummy switches all daisy chained together feeding them. There is zero configuration on them.
 So now I have a new HP 1920S switch I would like to integrate. And I would like to segment 36 out of the 48 ports of this switch into 3 different VLANs that cannot interact with our main 10.10.8.1/22 network. The groups being VLAN10; ports 1-12, VLAN20; ports 13-24, and VLAN30; ports 25-36, while using port 48 as a trunk for the 3 VLANs. This &quot;trunk&quot; (HP terms) is being fed into the piggybacked dummy switches. But when I test the isolation of these VLANs by plugging in two devices across two different VLAN segments, I can still ping eachother. This is where I think my lack of foundational network knowledge is hurting me...
 Even though I have 3 different VLANs configured on the switch, do I also need to create 3 different DHCP scopes to truly separate the various VLAN traffic from each other and the rest of the 10.10.8.1/22 network? If so, how do I tell the relevant VLAN traffic to be assigned to these new particular DHCP scopes? Is that done through more configuration in the HP switch, itself? I am trying to determine if I setup VLAN incorrectly and it&#x27;s not behaving how it should, or it&#x27;s setup correctly and my understanding isn&#x27;t correct.
 I hope this makes sense. Thank you for any input!

                              <span>Hello. Just wondering if there are folks here who worked with migrating legacy circuits to ethernet based network. We have a customer who is trying to abandon their old network that consists a lot of FR/HDLC/PPP interfaces. They are currently connected to a channelized STM1 interface of a Cisco ASR9000 router. The core network is running MPLS but they want to move the connections to the newer ASR9900 routers while they convince customers to move to ethernet and they no longer want to introduce legacy circuit types into the 9900 routers (not sure if there&#x27;s any module that still supports it there) The interfaces consists of L3VPN and L2VPN doing interworking. Are there any suggestions here on what device we can possibly put in to migrate those legacy circuits into a separate box so that we just connect that box into the ASR9900 as ethernet? There are suggestions that we use an ASR 1000 as the CE for these connections. Any other products outside Cisco shop? Thanks in advance.

 The thing is this. Each time I tried to configure WPA3 or WPA3+WPA2, there will be a &quot;Please Correct Error&quot; thing that comes out. After waiting for some time, 5 Ghz encryption always goes back to &#x27;None - Open&#x27;.
 Was anyone able to configure 5Ghz encryption successfully to WPA3+WPA2?

                              <span>Hello,
 Hope the Reddit Gods can help me out with this one.
 So I have one switch with two ports aggregated and using LACP. They connect to a stack switch with two members, to one port on each member. The two ports on the stack are also a part of a LAG with LACP enabled.
 My question is should one member of the stack die what exactly happens after the LACP timeout occurs on the other member?
 Thank you

 I hope someone here can point me in the right direction where to start because I have been trying but cannot figure out what&#x27;s happening:
 Issue:Both my MacMini as well as my MacBook have problems connecting to my Private WiFi (Guest WiFi works fine). Once connected get assigned an IPv4 Address but loose it right away and assign themselves an IPv6 Address. The IPv4 Information in the macOS Settings is empty. Once I click on &quot;Renew DHCP Lease&quot; it gets assigned an IP again and Connection works for around 10 seconds before it disappears again.
 Setup:Devices: MacBook Pro 2015, MacMini M1Network: Ubiquity Unifi Dream Machine, Connected via WiFi to main Network, already opened a ticket with support but they told me the logs look fine and they cannot find anything. The Devices appear as offline in the Unifi Interface despite being connected.
 Is this a Unifi Issue or a macOS Issue? Where can I start to look for fixesThanks so much in advance for any help!!

 The question may sound stupid, because there are a lot of articles and videos showing how to do this. But it doesn&#x27;t work for me.
 What I did:
  
I set SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable
 Rebooted my computer
 I&#x27;ve run Wireshark and was surfing a site I want to see a traffic for
 Stopped Wireshark. The log file isn&#x27;t empty.
 In Wireshark, I went to Edit/Preferences/Protocols/TLS and for input field (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename I set path to file which I&#x27;ve set path to in SSLKEYLOGFILE variable
  
After all that I see following in Wireshark: https://ibb.co/qBm0Kc3
 I use Windows 10 and Wireshark 4.0.5
 How can I fix that?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 We have finalllyyyyyy gotten some test lab hardware.
 So now i am playing with 2 nexus 9k&#x27;s and have upgraded them to 10.3.3.F ( in production today we are running 9.3.10 ).
 And the most wanted feature has been commit and rollback like we have on XR&#x27;s.
 With the conf dual-stage that is now a thing on nexus&#x27;es running code 10.1(2) or newer.
 What are your thoughts on this, and also have you guys used it?
 Main thing that annoys me a bit, is that it doesn&#x27;t replace configure ( conf t ).
 And also that you cannot do a config banner, to remind people that they should use conf dual-stage

 I have an issue where some devices dont get an ip address in certain subnet. For example in floor one everything works including the problematic devices. In floor 2 everything works except 1 desktop and few cisco meeting room touch panels. Both device are in the same vlan including laptops and the laptops work perfectly, its the same vlan and the same dhcp server, also cisco phones and access points work perfectly as well but on different vlans Note: each floor has each own broadcast domain and the address range is not fully utilaized I have run wireshark and the dhcp offer packet is missing., I see the device request an apipanaddress from the dhcp and the dhcp is replying with NAK massage Any idea why this specific devices wouldnt get dhcp?
 Thanks for help

                              <span>Hi all,
 Been working as a network admin/engineer for the past 7 years, based primarily on Aruba WiFi &amp; Switching/Arista Switch/Cisco Routing/Palo Alto firewalls &amp; SD-WAN/F5 load balancers &amp; also Splunk. 
 I have been presented an opportunity for a role as a senior network engineer. The role is based on Fortinet SD-WAN/Firewalls, Ubiquiti WiFI/Switching. Company consists of a large number of sites, though the sites are small in size, so Ubiquiti makes sense for their business requirements. 
 Something that is making me hesitant, is the fact that this company is using Ubiquiti WiFi/Switching &amp; doesn&#x27;t sound like there is much of a solid plan to move away from this to an enterprise solution. The cash for this role is more than what I am currently on, but I am a little concerned that by taking the role, my skills with enterprise equipment will squander, and it will be hard to move into a more enterprise role in the future. 
 I use Ubiquiti equipment at home, and it is fine, but not sure I&#x27;d use it an enterprise setting. 
 TLDR: If I take a role working on Ubiquiti equipment, will this tarnish my resume/skillset?

 associate switch technician (maintaining all the equipment that processed voice and data cellular calls) --&gt; &quot;systems technician&quot; which meant setting up the data center at the same service provider and then maintaining the routers and switches --&gt; brief stint working on one of their application platforms after years of data center work --&gt; got laid off and went to work in a NOC doing actual troubleshooting and some software upgrades / hardware upgrades with remote hands --&gt; bouncing around jobs every couple years as a network engineer, almost entirely doing the routing/switching side of things.

The United States and international cybersecurity authorities are issuing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight a recently discovered cluster of activity of interest associated with a People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actor, also known as Volt Typhoon. Private sector partners have identified that this activity affects networks across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, and the authoring agencies believe the actor could apply the same techniques against these and other sectors worldwide.

                              <span>TL;DR - Zoom sucks as a voice platform and apparently someone is spoofing our DIDs. Is this really an up and coming attack businesses are facing or is Zoom compromised and/or buggy and dialing themselves. 
 We use Zoom as our voice platform and recently (within the last week) we started getting reports that just seemed odd. It started with a few users stating that people were calling their DID numbers and saying they were returning a missed call. The two users swore that they never called these people and one was a current customer and the other some random person. The strange thing was that there was no record of an outbound call to either of these callers in the zoom portal phone logs. These two users attributed it to some glitch in the matrix and moved on with their lives.

                              <span>I need to start assembling some quotes for NTP appliances for our Small-Medium Enterprise environment. 
 I want something that can pull GPS time, and Internet NTP, and maybe FM radio time. 
 We currently use our core ASR routers and I want to shift that responsibility off the routers (so they can just be standard NTP clients) and onto something with a precision hardware clock. 
 We are financial services, but have no requirement for PTP, So I just need NTPv4. 
 I might upgrade from a standard clock to an OCXO style oscillator, but we don&#x27;t need Rubidium precision. 
 I&#x27;ll probably buy four appliances.
 One in each data center, one in each major user site.
 Our data centers have historically difficult GPS reception, so I don&#x27;t want to put all four in the 2 data centers. 
 The Symmetricom / Microsemi / Microchip S600 appliance is one product we&#x27;ll get quotes on. 
 The Meinberg LANTime M1000 is another contender. 
 The Meinberg SyncFire 1200 feels like an updated M1000, so I&#x27;ll explore that further as well. 
  
What other products in this space should I be looking at? 
  
Microsemi&#x27;s Domain Time NTP client for Windows (and other OSes).
 Is this something worth exploring, or should I just leave Microsoft&#x27;s w32time alone?
 I hate the way the PDC-emulator is the only device that feeds time into the rest of the domain.
 It violates the inherent resiliency of the NTP protocol&#x27;s design. 
  
As always, the wisdom of the great collective is always appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone, i don&#x27;t know if this subreddit is the right one, but i have a question about an implementataion of SAP B1 with a SUSE DB.
 The problem appears when the consultant wants to share a folder from the SUSE Server with a Guest account, but in my domain the Group policy that allows that is disable by default. They say SAP established that is imperative to make the change to work.
 They gave me a microsoft KB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/guest-access-in-smb2-is-disabled-by-default) to disable that policy and the shared folder works, but its an insecure practice and no one recommend it.
 It appers that the top management is going to push for this to happen.. Is this really the only way to do it as they say? can it be done in a more secure way? do i cross my arms when a ramsonware fuck things up?
 thanks in advance

                              <span>As the title says I’m curious as to what professions former sysadmins have gone to?
 I’ve been working over a decade in the field but I’m burnt out &amp; simply over it…fielding the seemingly endless on-call duties, addressing security breaches in the middle of the night, or ruined weekend plans due to emergency maintenance. 
 I’ve had enough as it’s not worth the compensation or my mental health (been dealing with panic attacks that seemingly popped up out of nowhere - as someone who doesn’t experience them often, it’s been terrifying).
 But yeah, just looking for suggestions and feedback on what day jobs you all have migrated to since leaving IT…I continue to work on my side hustle that I hope to eventually transition to full time but until that day comes I’ve still gotta hustle.

 Reached out to Microsoft, multiple times and no one understood the issue until finally were now supposedly waiting for a call from an engineer in the identity team. It’s been almost 2 weeks now with no real response other than a rep offering to make a note on a tik. 
 Anyone know of a resource to expedite this?

 These are instructions for how to update java on your server. Ya know, java, the software with new and amazing critical vulnerabilities every other week. Well, BMC&#x27;s solution for updating java for their java based software is that you need to hand edit dozens of files, registry keys, and environmental variables every single time. And because its java and it updates constantly you&#x27;ll be doing it over and over. You&#x27;d better hope to god there were no mistakes either because remedy also generates hundreds of logs in improbable locations containing what might as well be alien hieroglyphs. This issue is one of hundreds of problems with this software. 
 One time I had to get a developer on the line (which took an act of god and over a week) because I followed their own instructions and it blew up my system. He told me the support article in question missed a critical step that would always blow up your system if you didn&#x27;t do it. Apparently, updating the support articles was an ongoing project.
 My company is currently trying to switch vendors and I will do everything in my power to make it happen. If you have this software god help you.

                              <span>You could file this under a few dysfunctional categories. Full disclosure - I’m a people manager now, still wear quite a few hats, used to be a sysadmin, and I felt this rant slotted well here…
 So, I&#x27;m in the middle of driving my morning IT operations meeting and I&#x27;m getting Teams calls and messages from HR. ADP is “not working” and ADP is on the phone with HR saying that it&#x27;s a problem with our firewall.
 HR wanted me to join the call but I told them I didn&#x27;t have a problem statement from ADP to warrant IT involvement, but I&#x27;d investigate. I asked a few questions, gathered some errors and application behavior from HR, and then gathered some observations from some people on my team.
 Notable symptoms: people in HR couldn&#x27;t access some company personnel management features in the mobile app or web portal, users at home couldn&#x27;t access all features in the mobile app. Similar issues affecting multiple platforms on different networks.
 I informed HR via Teams that our firewall isn&#x27;t selective like that and the information gathered offers strong evidence that it&#x27;s something on ADP’s side that changed.
 Well, I was right. Sort of. Root cause? Accounts Payable failed to pay our ADP bill.

 So 7:45 this morning I am fumbling with my keys to open my door juggling my gear and a half cup of coffee just trying to get in my door when one of our older office workers comes running (as much as an older lady can) to tell me about an alarm on the fire panel that is going off 
 The alarm panels are not my area, but facilities won&#x27;t be in for a while and I know my way around them, so I ask what the alarm is for. Some of our extinguishers have sensors that detect if they get used o…</span>

 Digging through the logs it was caused by slidetoshutdown.exe and upon recreating the scenario and testting with my touchscreen tablet and a test VM I was able to recreate it.
 by holding the power button on the tablet to trigger the local slidetoshutdown if you&#x27;re also full screen RDP to a Windows machine it will also launch slidetoshutdown.exe dragging that window down will shut down the remote machine.
 can&#x27;t find a gpo to disable it, not keen on replacing the exe, trying a disallow applocker rule for now.
 crazy that this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of it happening considering how easy it is to do accidentally.

 Then trying to get hiring process going this year, we’ve been hit with all kinds of starts and stops only be finally told today that they need the budget to hire some AI devs.

 ​
 My boss says it should be fine, I think &quot;everything that can go wrong will go wrong&quot; especially since the ISP does not send us a protocol for the visit but only tells the person on location what things we have to install ourselves

                              <span>I&#x27;m a systems admin for a medium-sized org, and not super familiar with AWS, but wanting to know actual best practices for the scenario below. Please forgive the inexperience behind the question:
 Basically, our Dev team is moving a lot of dependencies for their apps away from local resources and more into our cloud environment. Currently, our media team writes directly to an on-prem FTP server and the dev team pulls the data from the FTP server and loads it into an S3 bucket. We have an application that pulls the content from the S3 bucket (as far as I&#x27;m aware). 
 Our lead dev asked if there was a way to connect our local network to an S3 bucket in AWS so that we can have our media team write their stuff directly to the S3 bucket rather than the local FTP server. I&#x27;m more familiar with Azure, so I had to do some digging as to how to make this happen. My initial thought is setting up a VPN to our VPC in AWS, but I may be way off on that. However, our IT Director is on an 8-week leave, and from a strategy perspective, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the right person to make the call, as I&#x27;m still fairly new to the org.
 From what I&#x27;ve researched, there is a way to mount an S3 bucket to a local Linux server. My understanding is that the local host would act as a proxy that would eliminate the need to manually move the content into the S3 bucket.
 Am I off on this? For those who have had a similar scenario, could you please share what you did? Telling the dev team to kick rocks until our director gets back to have a more broad design discussion is not out of the question, but I figured I would do my homework before I did so.

                              <span>Hi All
 We have an rather old 2012 R2 server as our only 2012 server remaining. Rather than just creating a new VM and setting them up again is this really the best approach in 2023? We don&#x27;t currently use Azure besides 365 and nobody has P1 licenses for most Azure features.
 I&#x27;ve also seen solutions like printlogic which could be a good alternative however we also have an EFI Fiery printer. 
 ​
 Any recomendations in this modern age on best practice for servers? It&#x27;s also the first time i&#x27;ve setup a print server post print nightmare!

 Source : https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-multifactor-authentication-server-will-be-deprecated-30-september-2024/
 I only use Office 365 for mail, calendar, etc...
 Some users and in particular admin of Office 365 organization use SMS or Auth APP as 2 steps authentication.
 I don&#x27;t really understand if I&#x27;m concerned by this deprecated. Someone can give me more information ?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi guys, i have an unusual problem.
 My PKI setup (which i inherited) consists of an offline root CA, an enteprise CA and another server with IIS for the http CRL availability.
 My Root CA CRL is expiring soon so i wanted to renew it.
 What i did:
 Fired up the Root CA, published the new CRL, copied the file to my Enterprise CA, used the command
 certutil -f -dspublish Root-CA.crl
 command completed succesfully, then copied the same CRL to the web server, restarted IIS.
 What happened:
 On pkiview i see that the CDP Location2 (the http) one is ok
 the cdp location 1 (ldap location) still shows the old CRL expiring date, it looks like it didn&#x27;t renew it.
 i do this every year and last time i didn&#x27;t have any issues.
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks for the help.

When i connect my Lenovo laptop or Dell xps 13 laptop I am able to use ethernet port without any issues including other features of thunderbolt port but i get connected to native vlan.
 When I go to windows and add vlan id to the network adapter, I do not get an ip assigned and it shows as unidentified network. If I had one laptop to use with the dock, I could have kept the port as untagged. I have the latest firmware on the dock along with drivers on both laptops.
 Previously i was using USB c dock and was able to use the feature without any issue. Any idea what can be the issue? Hopefully its not the dock, contains realtek ethernet port.

                              <span>Hi,
 We were having an issue with installing Feb 2023 .Net for Windows Server 2019 and also some Windows Server 2019 CU&#x27;s. Fixes that we found online included the below, none of which worked: 
  
Running sfc /scannow (never runs, always says a reboot is pending, even when we found a fix around this running sfc /scannow did nothing
 Running various DISM commands that were recommended didnt&#x27;t get us anywhere
 Tried extracting the update /cab files and installing them individually using DISM
  
My colleague found a fix which I am sharing here:
  
Take ownership of the following registry key then delete it:
  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\DriverOperations\0 2. Reboot the server - Sometimes the server will go through in percentages so let it be till it&#x27;s completed, it can take 5 or 10 minutes 3. Try installing .Net Framework again - Upon a reboot, Windows will indicate with a &quot;We couldn&#x27;t complete the updates&quot; message that it couldn&#x27;t install the update but it will continue installing it anyway 4. Install the latest CU - After a reboot it will be stuck on &quot;Working on updates: 100% Complete&quot; for 7- hours so leave the server to finish updating overnight

                              <span>Hi.
 I have a c-level user who just had his XPS motherboard replaced (2nd time in 18 months). After logging in, his Outlook, Teams and OneDrive are not connecting. Error is https://i.imgur.com/2QxOJCr.png
 The official Dell doc on this issues says to rename C:\users\\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy, then reboot. But this isn&#x27;t working. I have also renamed the other folder in that article, with no luck. 
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of googling on this issue and most responses say renaming the AAD folder above and rebooting fixed the issue.
 The TPM module is working according to powershell &quot;get-tpm&quot;. 
 Anyone got any other tips to try? The last resort seems to be re-creating the user profile.

                              <span>For our startup, we plan to provide technical support through some kind of ticketing system (necessarily free and open-source, since we are not planning to pay for Zendesk/Jira right now).
 What options can you advise if on the client side we want to see a simple window with online chat, and on our side the system with tickets, some information about the client (mail, country, etc.). If there will even be some metrics and a way to measure them - great. In general, free and more or less working analogue of Zendesk/Jira for text messaging.
 I&#x27;m thinking to do it via bot in Telegram, but I&#x27;m not sure if it will be convenient if there will be more than 100 clients.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a really strange issue with UAC and RDP for quite a while now and wondered if anyone else had come across similar
 Most of the time I&#x27;ll &#x27;Run as Administrator&#x27;, UAC prompt pops up, enter my admin credentials and no problems, same with RDP I&#x27;ll enter my credentials to login and connect in (not run as admin in that scenario, just a standard RDP process)
 However every so often with no pattern I&#x27;ll open a UAC or RDP prompt, enter my credentials and click OK and they just completely freeze up, UAC will eventually quit out after 5-10 minutes without opening anything, if I try and interact with the RDP prompt it sometimes comes up with &#x27;Credential manager UI host is not responding&#x27;
 If I simply restart my PC it all works fine for a bit again before breaking again hours/days/weeks later out of the blue
 I&#x27;ve rebuilt my PC (I say PC, it&#x27;s actually a VM) several times from scratch and it always comes back to haunt me eventually, happened with various Windows 10 builds and now I&#x27;m on Windows 11 22H2 but still the same and I&#x27;ve checked I&#x27;m fully up to date with Windows Update
 Does anyone have any ideas as it is starting to annoy me!

                              <span>Backstory:
 Previously I was a system engineer working in a devops environment, apart of sustainment and test team. I enjoyed this position because I was always learning something new, and the work was never stagnant. I ended up leaving to finish up my bachelor’s in a remote position.
 Now having completed my bachelor’s, and even before then, I have lost all motivation in this role. The overall company environment isn’t completely horrible but it is severely lacking( the people are nice). Overall the lack of job motivation has also pushed into my self learning. In my previous role, I always had the urge to self learn to stay on top of the environment I was working on.
 I feel like I’m stuck in this role. In the past few months I have had overall positive interviews but no bites. Usually because my clearance is still processing or lacked skill in one area leaving me has the “silver trophy winner”.
 Tl;dr: Current role I lost all motivation, but feel like I’m stuck

                              <span>I’m an intern. One of the other interns on my team got the code working on Friday and I sent in a text in our interns chat saying “damn, well done”.
 Monday morning I turn on my laptop and it says “chat policy updated on teams” to filter bad language or something like that. Was this turned on for just me? Was I reported for saying “damn” ?

                              <span>Hi, we&#x27;re having a weird issue where some of our Windows Servers are jumping back and forth in time. 
 The worst example is one server jumping several years into the future(!) messing up our databases and applications running. Most of the servers are on vmware esxi hosts. I cant find anything in the OS logs that points to what exactly is the cause of it. Time-sync between host and VM is disabled as well. 
 ​
 From one server where it recently jumped three days into the future before reverting to the correct date and time some hours later:
 ​
 Event viewer logs Kernel-General Event ID 1:
 The system time has changed to ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎18T09:39:30.714000000Z from ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎15T00:23:08.061881200Z.
 Change Reason: An application or system component changed the time.
 ​
 No snapshots are taken in this time period that could be the trigger for the VM to synch time with its host. Has anyone seen this before or could guide me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hello all. Just got in a new batch of HP Zbook 15.6&quot; Power G9s. Out the box they are a headache. BIOS is set for PXE. Once I am in the MDT environment I have no mouse pad(this becomes a heeadache when i am doing multiple machines at a time). Biggest issue is when it starts to go through the task list, I cannot get the drivers to inject. I have loaded the laptop drivers into the deployment server, as well as the updated WinPE drivers. I have tried with both secure boot on amd secure boot off. Not sure what I am missing here. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>We’ve been using WUfB (via Intune) and the driver option but have had 2-3 issues in 6 months where released drivers cause problems with audio, cameras and docks.
 We are co managed but would prefer to use Intune and not sccm for this, so what other options are available?
 I’ve looked at commercial vantage but wonder if we would see the same issues as WUfB here, but I’d rather not go back to the days of testing an approving every other driver update if I can help it either!

 There was a list of missing drivers in the device manager&#x27;s other devices category, so i tried to update via intelligent provisioning. There were no errors in the update proccess and after.
 But after i reboot, it wants me to plug in two power supplies, so i did and the amber blinking sign on health disappeared. But when i go back to intelligent provisioning, it shows self update and then it says error while loading shared libraries. 
 How do I fix this? https://i.imgur.com/PcV0Dse.jpg https://i.imgur.com/nvgrGOu.jpg

                              <span>Hi all. Just wondering if anyone is aware of a way to add existing devices to the OEM listing for AutoPilot? I was looking to push DFCI settings via Intune, but our devices are from Dell but all enrolled manually (Hardware Hash uploads), or by converting Hybrid devices, so the DFCI isn&#x27;t available to us direct. We have access to things such as the TechDirect setup at Dell, so wondering if there&#x27;s a way to &#x27;confirm&#x27; device ownership to allow this?
 Long shot and not the end of the world if it doesn&#x27;t work, but I thought worth asking!

                              <span>We have 4 office buildings dotted around a yard, currently using Netgear Orbi 6E but due to the fact the buildings are more than wifi range apart (though connected by wired LAN) the satellite nodes cannot communicate with the primary gateway node. That means I can&#x27;t update them in place, I have to disconnect them and bring them into the same building to run updates. I think it&#x27;s also causing satellites to inexplicably stop working every few months until they&#x27;re restarted.
 Is there any 6E mesh system which doesn&#x27;t mind if the nodes can&#x27;t talk to each other over wifi? I&#x27;d really have expected just being on the same wired LAN would have been okay with the Orbi but no such luck. I don&#x27;t really mind if it&#x27;s consumer, the Orbi experience is very consumer despite being marketed to businesses. Wifi is secondary to ethernet in our offices, I just want a system that doesn&#x27;t require frequent manual interventions.

                              <span>Hi
 One of our servers, running Windows Server 2016 Standard, is having issues communicating with our Domain Controller (same OS).
 DNS is fine, with all the usual ping tests showing no issues:
 Ping server
 Ping example.local
 Ping server.example.local
 Signing into the problematic server is intermittently slow, with the following error messages being present:
 The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2/2611a202-62d5-4d03-923f-feb1cf81e719/EXAMPLE.local 
 with error code &quot;There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)&quot;. --- The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 ldap/SERVER.EXAMPLE.local/EXAMPLE.local@EXAMPLE.LOCAL 
 with error code &quot;There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)&quot;.
 I believe we have isolated it to the security update KB5011233 - after uninstalling and rebooting the server on Friday, it worked fine; however it was reinstalled over the weekend and the issue is now recurring.
 I&#x27;ve looked online and tried a few fixes, but so far aside from uninstalling the update, I haven&#x27;t been able to fix this.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

                              <span>Hello Guys,
 I come to you to get some advise and opinions, maybe some insight, on who should be the owner of a shared folder. We had the issue this morning with someone who didn&#x27;t have access since we couldn&#x27;t properly re-inherit the permissions to the subfolders.
 The issue was that some folders were owned by User A, Creator of some subfolders, and not by User B, Owner of the Main shared folder.
 Normally it looks something like this. See picture below.
 Imgur Picture
 In my experience the Owner usually is the local Administrator or the group &quot;Domain Admin&quot;. For now we have put &quot;Domain Users&quot; and we have added each user (not like on the picture) manually. Meaning that we don&#x27;t yet work with an AD group that gets assigned to each user for access instead of each user is manually added.
 So my question is the following. Is it ok to leave &quot;Domain Users&quot; as owners or should be put &quot;Domain Admins&quot;? Is it maybe a security issue or cause other problems? It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve done it myself and I don&#x27;t remember who I put as owner on those cases.

If i put the same setting static IP ect in the old Motorola MC9190 (We are trying to replace the old Motorola with the Zebra) they connect right away and can use the AS400 emulation app with no issues. 
 Started a couple weeks ago and driving me nuts. Anyone else use these scanners?

                              <span>On multiple occasions now the threat policies that you define in the security center have malfunctioned heavily. We have tested this heavily, let&#x27;s say we have three outbound spam policies:
 ​
 - No Send Limit (Unlimited)
 - Test Send Limit (5)
 - Default Policy (500)
 ​
 1) Scoped a user to policy &quot;Test Send Limit&quot; and sent out 50 mails. User was restricted from sending in the Security Portal and an alert was triggered. But mails could be sent out half a day later without problems and the user was still blocked in the portal.
 2) Scoped a user to policy &quot;No Send Limit&quot;. Multiple days passed, so enough time was given for the policy to be active in M365. Suddenly, user was restricted after sending out 500 mails as if the default policy applied. This can never be because the default policy has the lowest priority and therefore explicit policies always take precedence.
 ​
 This was raised as a ticket at Microsoft and escalated and I did supply them lots of information over multiple weeks. I never got the resolution to the problem and at some point they just stopped answering my mails.

                              <span>Hello
 Since OD / SharePoint Online has been introduced in this company there has been a weird problem around.
 If I upload a file about 500MB or bigger to the cloud, synchronize it&#x27;s directory to my local storage and then try to open it, I get the error &quot;the rpc server is unavailable&quot;.
 The second try it always works and I&#x27;ve already checked/tried the following points:
 · Firewall
 · Tried different networks
 · Checked that the following services are up &amp; running: -Remote Procedure Call (RPC), RPC Endpoint Mapper &amp; DCOM Server Process Launcher
 · ipconfig /flushdns
 · Can&#x27;t trace the network traffic because OD&#x27;s traffic is encrypted
 The problem affects all clients in the company and I&#x27;ve never had it in any other OD/SharePoint environment, is anyone familiar with the issue and may even know the cause / a solution?
 Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

 The value had changed to &quot;Microsoft managed&quot; in our case because we had disabled it before 5/17. Now that it&#x27;s been set again it sounds like it will stick, but this was pretty sneaky. We disabled it in order to shunt people to the full Microsoft Authenticator, which has a couple other key features.
 ​
  
Updated May 17, 2023: Today we are starting rollout for Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) to enter GA! The Microsoft managed value of this feature will be changed from ‘disabled’ to ‘enabled’ on June 9th. We have made some changes to the feature configuration, so if you made an update before GA (5/17), please validate that the feature is in the correct state for your tenant prior to June 9th. If you do not wish for this feature to be enabled on June 9th, move the state to ‘disabled’ or set users to include and exclude groups.
  
Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) is a feature that allows your users to complete multi-factor authentication for their work or school account using Outlook on their iOS or Android device. This feature will be enabled on June 9th for all tenants that have not disabled it. If you do not wish for this feature to be enabled on June 9th, move the state to ‘disabled’ or set user include and exclude groups prior to June 9th.

                              <span>On our network we have partnered with a local PD. Basically we have a campus in a high crime area. Local PD approached us about tapping into outdoor cameras to have live viewing (Decision is made and way above my pay grade). I walked into the network we have and I am in the process to make it better.
 Basically the PD uses a third party (FUSUS) that goes on our network and has access to certain cameras over IP and a read user of the camera. Device needs internet access and access to 5-6 specific cameras.
 I plan to put the device on an &quot;Unmanaged Device&quot; subnet/vlan add policies to our firewalls as well as acls at the switch level. Anything else I can do to help?

 There is a quite a bit of fuzz regarding full stack network engineers and their demand in future. Can someone guide on what exactly we need to be equipped with in order to be one?

Is this even allowed because I read somewhere VPC doesn&#x27;t support L3.

                              <span>I have 3 different network racks in different buildings that are in desperate need of some love. Over the years the cables have gotten tangled together and looped around so much that I can barely get my hands in there to unplug them from the switch, let alone try and pull the cable and trace it back to the patch-panel. 
 The one that is my main priority has over used 300 switchports and 11x 48-port patch-panels. There are 2 racks, one with 6 patches on the top half and the other with 5 patches on the top and switches on the bottom half. There are cable organizers on the racks but they are overflowing and literally will not fit a single cable more.
 I have never taken on something of this scale before so I want to make sure I&#x27;m not getting in over my head.
 What has been your guys&#x27; experience? Any tips and tricks for tackling this problem?

 This company is managing around 2000 customer and has been operating for 10 years.
 To me it seems like a really big deal.
 But I am not sure how to address this to my boss or superior.
 I just joined and starting to peaking faults at the very beginning doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea but again I can&#x27;t overlook the security risk.
 How should I proceed ?

 Connect failed:(30044) No available encryption algorithms match with the server
 I know the security implication, but we are going to slowly upgrade all the machines.
 In the meantime, do you know of any workaround? I usually use Putty and allow weaker cipher/algorithms, but I can&#x27;t find the way on Cattools.

                              <span>Load testing for Applications in a new site?
 So we have a new site setup and it&#x27;s up, no users yet in the site.
 We have a couple of PCs setup for testing and are planning to test application performance on the PCs over the network 
 What tools are available for this and does anyone have any experience in doing this?
 What else do we have to test? (I&#x27;m sure everything will be fine anyways since there won&#x27;t be too many users initially and total users will still be 500-600 max for the site in the long term but still need to test).
 We have 3750 switches as access switches which are temporary (will be replaced by 9300s when they arrive). And nexus 9k switches as core in a Cisco 2-tier deployment with 2 gig redundant links back to the data center (which is like 10 miles away).
 Edit: can iperf be used for stress testing?
 Thank you

 We currently use Clover as our PCI compliant pen testing that our bank states we must use but from my experience they are extremely terrible. Does anyone have any advice on a good pen testing company to check out? I was think Nessus or maybe Rapid7.

                              <span>Does anyone have any good resources for best practices on a outdoor IP camera topology design? We are running into issues today with being able to reliable provide connectivity to cameras in large parking lots or fields (multiple acres). 
 Cameras installed on the exterior of the building are fine as we can home run them to our MDF/IDFs and the distance are typically under 100m. Where we run into issues is with our PTZ cameras on the outer part of the property which are typically over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF. Additionally, these cameras for the most part have a 60w/90w PoE requirement. 
 While each camera is over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF they are sometimes within 100m of a few neighboring cameras on poles/property edge. 
 We&#x27;ve gone down the rabbit hole of ethernet extenders, PoE extenders, fiber converters with PoE injectors, P2P wireless systems (separate from our wireless deployment), and they all are hit or miss. 
 Should we be looking a ring topology and deploying small outdoor PoE switches on the pole and connect as many cameras as we can, and the daisy chain of that switch via fiber to the next one? Or should we deploy a couple of edge switches in NEMA cabinets on the ground and feed as many cameras as we can from them?
 Appreciate any insight, experience, or resources anyone has for a situation like this.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t found anything definitive on the internet and it bothers me. 
 2 different ISP lines are plugged into a switch (HP Procurve). 2 more ports on that same switch go to the router. The router is programmed with the static IPs for the two ISPs and it just works. There are no VLANS setup and in fact no management at all done on the switch.
 Why does this work without any VLANs setup on the switch and router?
 Is there any concerns with this setup.

 Sorry if this is an oddly specific post, but I didn&#x27;t see a sub for Dell Networking, and the SNMP sub seems to be dead. If there is a sub for this kind of question, I&#x27;d love to check it out. I&#x27;ve made a post on the Dell forum without any success.
 In the process of implementing IPv6 on my university network, I&#x27;m trying log IPv6 Neighbor Table entries via SNMP, to have records available indicating which host had which IPv6 address. I&#x27;ve been able to query my Cisco switches without a problem, and can get the desired IPv4 data from the Dell switches (I&#x27;m also doing ARP tables), but the IPv6 queries are returning unusable data.
 When querying IPV6-MIB::ipv6NetToMediaNetAddress using snmpwalk, I get the message No Such Object available on this agent at this OID.
 When querying IPV6-MIB…</span>

 question! so i currently work in film and 2.4 is massively busy. for this reason i have taken my opted to not allow the 2.4 band to be used when connecting to my ubiquity AP&#x27;s. 
 will my aps even though they&#x27;re not using 2.4 still causing interference with other devices on the same 2.4 channel?

 I&#x27;m currently working in a dual role as a Network Security Engineer and Network Engineer, and I hold CCNP Enterprise (ENARSI), CCNP Security (SNCF), and CCSE - Checkpoint certifications. My daily work involves dealing with Checkpoint, ASA, FMC, as well as Cisco routers and switches. I come from a smaller country where complex routing needs seem to be dwindling as many networks are transitioning to firewall-focused designs, with exceptions for configurations like DMVPN.
 Both network security and routing are areas that I am passionate about, but I&#x27;m at a crossroads in terms of my career progression. My daily tasks involve a lot of security-related work, but the routing experience I&#x27;m gaining is mainly limited to BGP. I&#x27;m continuously reading documentation, learning, and lab…</span>

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m trying to set up a VPN gateway (using LXD containers). I&#x27;m using ufw for killswitch service. Almost all is working except for port forwarding. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 In my VPN gateway I have:

 So, what am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Hi! 
 I am going to Cisco Live in Las Vegas and have signed up for the CCT (Cisco Certified Technician) exam.
 Have been working with networking for about 6 years and feel like I have a good knowledge in the field, but I guess there is still a lot of exam specific things I should look into before going. 
 Does anyone have recommendations to content that could be helpful for this?

                              <span>Hi guys. A few years ago I bought a crimping tool which worked great. I&#x27;m wanting to go through my cables now and replace with cat 6.
 So I bought the cable and some pass through connectors as I heard they were easier, None of the cables I made worked so I looked back at the advert for the tool and it says not compatible with cat 6, I&#x27;ve now read they are thicker with staggered connectors. Am I ok to carry on using the tool I have with cat 5e rj45 connectors but cat 6 cable as I don&#x27;t need the full 10gbs. I was just going to buy another crimping tool but most of the Amazon adverts say they are suitable for all sizes but how can they be if the Cat 6 ones are staggered 🤔 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Got a customer in the process of migrating from their On-prem file server to SharePoint. They use Adobe Acrobat pretty extensively and would like to use the Adobe SharePoint online integration so they can save directly to SharePoint locations from Adobe. I&#x27;ve created a custom MSI installer with the Acrobat customisation wizard and got that working to enable the custom Adobe save and open experience.
 Wondering if there is a way to add SharePoint sites using this tool or a registry edit so that the SharePoint site file storage locations/accounts are preconfigured on install.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hey fellow Redditors,
 I&#x27;m currently leading a project in my mid-sized organization, where we&#x27;re undergoing a transition from Slack to Teams. The project was assigned to me recently, and we have a tight timeline of just 2 months to complete the transition. 
 However, the company has historically been resistant to change, and some executives have already expressed concerns about the switch. As a relatively new member of the company, I don&#x27;t have much experience with Slack, but I&#x27;ve been entrusted with leading this transition.
 While I believe that people just need time to adjust to the new system, I wanted to reach out to the community for advice. 
 Are there any important considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of during this transition period? My goal is to ensure a seamless migration and minimize any disruptions to our workflow.
 Additionally, I&#x27;m curious to learn about the similarities and differences in features between Teams and Slack. Are there any features that exist in both platforms? Furthermore, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate any insights into unique features offered by Slack that may not be available in Teams.
 Thank you in advance for your guidance and insights!

 Edit: server is IBM, not Lenovo. 
 I&#x27;m hoping that someone might be able to help point me in the direction of a solution because I&#x27;m stumped.
 Short background: I work in K-12 and our previous systems admin left for a new job a few months ago. His position was vacant (though his assignments were distributed across a few different people) until roughly a month ago when I was offered the spot. I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to server hardware and RAID configurations in practice, but I understand the theory. This was all understood by my senior leadership before they offered me this job and we all understand I am learning this through trial by fire. 
 The situation: Last week we get a work order from a remote site that users can&#x27;t access their site&#x27;s server. The …</span>

 In the output of who -a I see:
 pts/5  6650 id&#x3D;ts/5 term&#x3D;0 exit&#x3D;2
 When I look in /dev/pts I expected to see 5, but there is only 0 - 4 and ptmx.
 When I run fuser /dev/pts/5 the output is 6823, but every time I run this the number changes for the process so I can&#x27;t figure out which process is using pts/5.
 Here are my questions: - How do I figure out what process is using pts/5? - should I be concerned about this since it is mostly used with ssh or telnet.

                              <span>I worked for a company for eight years, reported to the CFO, and was promoted to Director of IT during that time. Then the company brought in a CIO and 3 months later I was let go because according to her I wasn&#x27;t on board with her plans. I had previously gone to HR stating that in those 3 months I had 3 meetings with her, was being cut out of all other meetings/planning, and had NO idea what was going on.
 I am now filling out an employment history for a new job and they want my previous supervisors contact info. Should I refer to the one that was my boss for 7+ years or the one for 3 months?
 Your opinions are appreciated.

                              <span>My ex boss was horrible. No one in the organization that I talked to liked him. One person on our team, maybe, because he got away with doing next to nothing.
 I don’t know the whole story but he resigned and we already have a replacement who’s sooo much better, more organized, more engaged, more communicative, more experienced… it’s like a night and day difference. 
 Now I feel the need to explain why shits all f’d up to the new boss. I sent him a list of job duties and started it with “I haven’t been able to do my actual job for 6+ months” because I’ve been forced to cover helpdesk and other areas that aren’t supposed to fall to me. I’m honestly embarrassed by the state of things.

                              <span>I work for a company with an IT team and a cloud operations team... the lines between both are pretty blurry.
 Is this common? - it just doesnt make much sense to me... I always think one team and having people specialise makes more sense... i.e. if an &quot;IT&quot; person can help with a cloud issue or a &quot;Cloud&quot; person can help with an IT issue.

 Create a MS Teams meeting for the time you want to be left alone and invite yourself.
 Join the meeting. It will just be you in the meeting, but to the rest of the world it will show you are on a call. A very “important” call.
 Take it a step further and screen share a random application window. Maybe just a Notepad with nothing on it.
 Your status will go into presenting mode thus indicating you are mega busy.
 Probably works for Zoom and stuff too. Using Cisco Jabber with presence enabled and also picks up that you are busy on a call.

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting onboarded to be the senior admin at a small company as the existing admin is set to retire soon. They sell software which basically consists of a desktop app (office workers) and a mobile app (field works) with a back end in SQL.
 Most all our customers are small as well without dedicated IT depts. So if a customer chooses, our company will host their SQL &amp; Web Server in a cloud VM, give it a public IP, and let the mobile app and desktop apps connect there rather than the customer hosting it themselves.
 Last week, I was being shown how we buy and license SQL for a new implementation. The guy showed me we get SQL standard and enough CALs to cover each office user, plus one CAL to cover every mobile user, because the app connects to a web server first, then to the SQL server, so SQL would never know that there&#x27;s multiple app users.
 Granted MS licensing is convoluted, but this is not how I understand CALs. Every mobile user, even though the app is connecting to a middleware, needs a CAL right? Yet this is how they&#x27;ve sold their software for the past few years.
 Not sure exactly what to do now that I&#x27;ve seen this? Bringing it to the attention of owners potentially puts a target on me as overstepping and being a threat to their business model? I&#x27;m not even sure how to bring something like this up. Usually big problems are things that are visible like failed hardware. Owners might say &quot;It works - I don&#x27;t see the issue&quot; and I don&#x27;t blame them - it&#x27;s hard to understand.
 Fixing it and just eating the license cost could be difficult given this company&#x27;s size. Re-quoting customers that have been live for years on our software telling them they&#x27;re not compliant seems equally impossible. Yet this is my living and I kinda need the company to do well so that I can do well. I feel like I&#x27;ve walked into a time bomb that was impossible to see from the outside.

                              <span>I have a member of staff who is new to IT doing L1 work. They talk a good game but are lazy with failure to complete simple tasks fully, they constantly watch YouTube videos and suddenly minimise when I walk by but often too late so I can clearly see what they are up to and when I try to explain a task fully they constantly interrupt and don’t start talking about something totally irrelevant to the task. 
 It’s also coupled with 30 minute trips to the toilet that I cannot ignore as the bathroom is opposite my desk. 
 How would you deal with this individual, ideally I would like to replace them with someone who actually cares. 
 I have notified HR but need to gather a good approach to this too.

I have gone DND on Teams to stop all the popups in the corner of my screen while I focus on the task. This is something I’m very capable of dealing with; I just need everyone to go away for 20 mins.
 Phone call comes through to the office.
 Manager: Hi, what’s the problem?
 Me: Sorry? Problem?
 Manager: Why have you gone DND on Teams?
 Me: I’m working through an issue and don’t need the constant pop ups. It&#x27;s distracting.
 Manager: Well you shouldn’t do that.
 Me: I’m sorry…
 Manager: I need to you to be available at all times.
 Me: I am available, I’m just busy.
 Manager: I don’t want anyone on DND. It looks bad.
 Me: What? It looks bad? For whom?
 Manager: For anyone that wants to contact you. Looks like you’re ignoring them.
 Me: Well at this moment in time I am ignoring them, I’m busy with this thing that needs fixing.
 Manager: Turn off DND. What if someone needs to contact you urgently?
 Me: Then they can phone me, like you’re doing now.
 Manager: … … just turn off DND.
 ... middle micro managers: desperate to know everyone&#x27;s business at any given moment just in case there&#x27;s something they don&#x27;t know about and they can weigh in with some non-relevant ideas. I bet this comes up in next weeks team meeting.

                              <span>Teams on Android is usually pretty stable and straightforward so it&#x27;s surprising to see this issue. Even MS support, from my continued discussions with them, is baffled.
 Essentially, we got a user reporting that he doesn&#x27;t have the option to select Bluetooth from the list of output devices. He just sees device and speaker. Issue started back in April.
 We can confirm the following with the user:
  
On a recent BYOD Android device -- Galaxy S22 Ultra running Android 13.
 We have no MDM in place to enforce a certain version of the app.
 Headset is a Sony WH-1000XM4.
 Can confirm the headset is detected and functional in other apps, e.g. YouTube, Audio Recorder, and Phones.
 Tried a cache clear through system settings and the Android settings itself.
 Tried a reinstall of Teams from the app store.
  
Not really sure why this would be happening and MS support feels the same way too.
 I&#x27;m thinking about having the user download an older version of Teams. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, all.
 So I&#x27;m new to cloud support and our workflow is mostly in managing the server of our clients. Sometimes, we have a new client and they want to migrate their files from their current server to their new server(where we set-up and manage).
 My question is what is the best scripting language to compare old files to new files. The software we use is filezilla and sometimes filezilla doesn&#x27;t fully transfer the files especially if it&#x27;s a folder within a folder. But the main thing here is what is a good scripting language to compare files (size disk) &amp; (contains) from old server to new. Because I checked the files manually and it&#x27;s taking much time. 
 Thank you everyone.

                              <span>SOLVED: Thanks, now I know it is a power issue with SFP.
 Hey folks,
 Quick question. Setting up some cabling (up to 45m of cable) which I plan to with two 10GbE NICs. Thinking of going with SFP+ slots for possible future fiber upgrade.
 Noticed something though: SFP+ modules seem to indicate a range limit, usually 30m or 80m max. Is this a SFP+ thing? Or do regular NICs have this too, but just don&#x27;t advertise it?
 It was my expectation that with a normal 10GbE RJ45 NIC and proper cat6a under 100 meters, 10GbE links could be established. Now I have doubts about that being a thing or just a theoretical limit which are not feasible with normal NICs (and them just working under 30m too or something similar).
 Any advice, insight or recommendations would be awesome.
 Cheers!

                              <span>So we contracted an ISP to provide a layer 2 extension for part of our network.
 Essentially we VLAN 20, we have 6 hosts on it. The isp connects to that network and provides q in q to a remote site.
 I can see multicast (osp traffic) across their link. We can also see MACs across it. But it won&#x27;t support pinging a host across the network.
 I&#x27;ve been struggling to imagine what could be the issue. Best I&#x27;ve got is some kind of vlan issue in their network allowing layer 2 and BUM traffic but no unicast.
 We got them to finally attempt to test unicast rraffic after days of them saying it was our issue. Of course they weren&#x27;t able to pass unicast traffic either and are investigating where the issue is

                              <span>Hi r/networking!
 I&#x27;m a junior sysadmin/hobbyist working on a script and ansible suite for managing an automated lab infrastructure in a VMWare environment and am now looking for some input on E-W traffic design! (Preliminary note: As of current design, for any edge router 1-8 internal firewall &#x27;zones&#x27; can be implemented and any one internal firewall &#x27;zone&#x27; can be a mirrored DMZ of an internal zone. Any firewall in turn can manage 8 different portgroups connected to an arbitrary amount of hosts. All backdoor management is through an isolated private vlan.)
 In the first image I&#x27;ve connected the edge router to two portgroups, one for internal traffic and one for dmz traffic. Any firewall-router belonging to one of these two categories would be connected to one of these two portgroupps. https://snipboard.io/oSHWN5.jpg
 In the second image all firewall-routers have been isolated to their own portgroup, connected in turn to the edge-router. https://snipboard.io/oIU4r1.jpg
 My question is: What would be best practice with consideration of system internal traffic and separation of duties? Would you want the edge router to route internal east-west traffic if it delegated to different firewalls? Or would you want them on a shared &#x27;uplink&#x27; portgroup and subnet and do the east-west traffic by themselves? Spontaneously I&#x27;d say that the edge-router should primarily be concerned with North-South and internal traffic is to be managed on the internal firewalls, but then again, I have little to no experience. Would these be easier to manage as well rather than muddying the waters to have the firewalls do *some* firewalling in regards to internal EW traffic and the edge router do *some* of that as well?
 I appreciate any input and thanks for reading. :)

 Basically if you browse reddit and you have a plan of 8GB/mo - you use the alloted data. But if you browse facebook - you don&#x27;t use anything from your plan.
  
 It&#x27;s pretty stupid what they do considering social networks alongside youtube are largest bandwidth takers, but whatever. Are there any creative solutions to let&#x27;s say browse reddit this way?

                              <span>The extensive report released this week by Special Counsel John Durham on the FBI’s targeting of the Trump campaign has prompted demands for accountability within the FBI – but also attempts to downplay the findings by Biden officials and the legacy media, alike. We speak to Real Clear Investigations senior writer Mark Hemingway about the troubling revelations and sweeping implications of the Special Counsel report. Get the facts first on Morning Wire.

 I would like toigrate my data from Helpscout to Freshdesk, and i found this website : https://help-desk-migration.com.
 But no pay to 4000 euros when I could do the same via integromat ( Make) and the right call.
 Is there someone that already done it and therefore would have kind of a list of the equivalents fields between freshdesk and helpscout by any chance ? 
 It would be amazing ! Thanks for your help !

 I have a user with an almost full mailbox, I’ve gone ahead and applied a retention policy to his mailbox to move his mail going forward. However I need to move mail from some large sub folders in his inbox to the In-Place Archive folder and break it up by a date range (2021,2022)etc..Does anyone have a good way to do this via powershell.

                              <span>Context: an email migration was done to Office 365(exchange online).
 I set up a user with the outlook mobile app on their phone. They report however that emails only start to populate in the outlook app on the phone after opening the outlook desktop app that is profiled on a machine we have for the user. I have not been able to see this in action. Initially I thought it might have been the focused view. Turned that off and confirmed that emails were no longer missing. However, the user is reporting this happening again. I checked exchange properties and confirmed active sync is enabled and even detects the phone that is set up. Just posting here in case I am missing something to check or if y’all have run into this before. My guess is that it’s something with the client(mobile phone) as I have set up other users on their mobile phones and similar reports have not been heard. Thanks in advance for any advice/commentary. Just a bit paranoid is all since it’s a very important user.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking about switching jobs and I&#x27;d like to understand where I stand in the marketplace.
 I&#x27;ve been working for 2.5 years (first tech job) as a &quot;Software Support Engineer&quot; at a small content management system company. We host a lot of clients&#x27; CMS applications and websites in our private clouds.
 My role entails daily work with clients who submit user knowledge tickets as well as report software issues with the CMS product and site implementations built by our developers. We do not have any tiered support so I handle whatever issue, regardless of complexity. I also do product QA, UAT and delivery, and very often spin up VMs for new client or internal development environments, set up websites and services, etc. (DNS, load balancer configurations, headers, VPNs, FTP, etc)

                              <span>With all this talk of &quot;outlook isn&#x27;t your ERP/CRM/file repository&quot;... 
 What is the right software for a 6-7 person project-based business? 
 We currently use a very small collection of sharepoint lists tied to a power-automate app to create template project folders/files in our teams/onedrive environment + project tracking using Microsoft Planner (all to varying levels of commitment to the digital system depending on the employee). Outlook basically handles all the rest of our customer interaction tracking.
 I have been casually looking at Odoo or Netsuite with the thought of doing a slow rollout myself starting with my projects and slowly rolling out to the other 5 employees. But this is so far down my list I wouldn&#x27;t even say its totally on my radar. 
 That being said, if outlook is moving toward this &quot;new&quot; view, with all of those features missing, this may move way up my priorities list.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had an epiphany and realised that I want more from my career. I&#x27;m senior engineer for a small MSP and I&#x27;m going nowhere. Salary is poor and I just feel that I&#x27;m wasting my talents. I&#x27;m a great organiser and planner. I have good, broad technical knowledge and I&#x27;m a fast thinker and can come up with solutions to complex problems quickly.
 Trouble is I&#x27;m 56, but I don&#x27;t feel it and many people are surprised when the find out. I&#x27;m looking for IT Manager roles in a larger organisation. Would anyone even consider me at that age. I&#x27;m in Yorkshire, in the UK, if that helps.

                              <span>I work for an MSP, with my title being Jr SysAdmin. It’s a completely unearned title, given that most of my day to day is typical help desk shenanigans, but my position is unique in that 90% of the company does remote work, 9.9% does on-site onboarding/infrastructure building, and I’m part of the 0.1% (as in ~3 people) who works on-site full time for a client.
 Well, the client wants to end the contract. CTO is a paranoid fuck and never wanted to give the keys up to any of his systems for us to work with, one of the reasons I was told is because I’m not part of their ethnoreligious group, so I’m considered an “outsider”. Fine, whatever. But everyone else at the client loves me. I get great customer feedback, my metrics are great, and even my supervisors are always singing my praises because of all the on-site techs they’ve sent in the past, I’m the only one who’s stuck around and been consistently good at the job.
 So the contract is up June 30th, and my company informed me that they won’t be keeping me on past that. They’re going to let me go despite a perfect record. I’m assuming it’s because I make $60k a year for what’s basically a glorified help desk, but I digress. 
 I don’t know why I’m writing this to be honest, I’m just frustrated as hell. I’m a Marine Corps Reservist, so that makes finding a civilian job harder. This also comes right after I signed off on a new apartment, and I have 3 weeks worth of obligations family/military wise in August. Fucking wish I never did IT, this shit blows.

                              <span>Hey folks, I have over 5 years as a sysadmin at my current job and over 10 years in total experience, also have several certs.
 With all the layoffs happening right now, I&#x27;m wondering if its safer to stay at my current company or jump. I feel like its very possible we may have layoffs coming next year and I know a lot of companies do layoffs by &quot;last in first out&quot;
 I feel like if I jumped jobs I could make way more money (like a lot more, probably 50% more), but not sure if that would open me up to less stability. I live in LCOL so while more money would def be nice, I&#x27;m not dying or anything. I also work 100% remote and am not open to anything not 100% remote. I feel like there isn&#x27;t much room for advancement at current co, but the job is relatively chill most days and the benefits are good. Current co does offer decent severance also from what I&#x27;ve heard if layoffs did happen.
 I feel like I probably want to jump eventually but not sure if the timing is right. Would suck to change cos, then they announce massive layoffs and you&#x27;re the first to be let go, since they just hired you. Any advice would be appreciated!

 I have 1 dedicated Windows 2019 DHCP server on a intranet setup. Sometime yesterday, my DHCP server is being flooded with BAD_ADDRESS entries. My clients are connected via lan port and no wireless connectivity is enabled. 
 Have tried removing the BAD_ADDRESS entries but they keep coming back almost immediately after deletion. 
 What could be the possible cause?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are experiencing issues with all the Macs that we updated to Ventura.
 Users are connecting via SMB (2.1 and 3.1.1) to our main fileserver (Server 2019) because we have a mixed Windows/Mac environment.
 This have been performed pretty well last years. But after upgrading several Macs to Ventura all the users with Ventura complaining about very poor performance with Quick preview. Sometimes it takes 20s to load a 20kb image. 
 Opening the file is not a problem and the image is loaded instantly, but the preview is not responding well.
 When the same users are working on our Archive server (Synology NAS) with SMB, they are having no issues.
 We even reinstalled several devices, but no luck. All the Monterey are not having any issues.
 I can’t find anything on the internet that may help resolve our issue. Hopefully someone here has the golden tip.

 My company is going to lay off people due to &quot;other companies are doing it, too&quot; amongst some other bullshit. I worked my ass off as a Sys Admin. Supporting 15+ apps, most without any training or good documentation. No promotion for me or my peers in years except people overseas (i work in the US). I&#x27;m brushing up my resume and started looking for another job. So, if/when i do get the boot what are some things to ask or do concerning the exit? Thank you in advance if i don&#x27;t get to reply to your comment.

                              <span>Hi,
 So for some reason a department thought it was a great idea to include a 4.8Mb .gif file in their mail signature. This results in their emails being huge and it is quickly becoming an issue (no big surprise)
 Obviously we will send out a mail telling everyone yo not use any sort of .gif or .webm in their mails. At least not as attachments.
  
 So my question is, is anyone blocking something like this? Would,it make sense to block .gif in mails if they are abive 250Kb or something? Any other suggestions.

                              <span>Greetings,
 One of the healthcare Mobile apps used by Doctors provides instant messaging and voice services and some clinical notifications via integration to or EHR servers. All servers (App and EHR) are located in our premises in the internal segment, and we publish one port (xmpp) to the internet where the mobile app connects to.
 When doctors are at home, the mobile app gets instant messages only, no voice capabilities are enabled over the internet, as this is a regulatory compliance thing. 
 On premise, as standard security practice, all doctors personal mobile devices are in guest WiFi vlan, isolated from the internal resources. There is a requirement to open up the guest Wi-Fi vlan to the mobile app servers in the internal segment to enable voice services. Now I’m totally against this, and the mobile app does support any MAM integrations, but would like to understand how admins deal with and secure access to similar business mobile apps.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to run containers simply like using Docker but safely using virtualization while keeping it performant as possible.
 I came across to two project that caught my attention:
 a) KataContainers
 b) Firecracker
 But I&#x27;m really confused about how they work, what are the differences and what is more performant. Would appreciate if anyone help me to clarify that.
 KataContainers looks simple. You can easily configure it as Docker container runtime. If I understand correctly, firecracker-containerd enables you to do the same as Kata, right? If so, what are the differences between them? What are pros and cons? In what cases should be one used over another? Which one is more performant?

 Right now were using telegraf and grafana, but I&#x27;m wondering if there are other solution out there.
 Some googling came up with Zabbix as a possibility.

Dang phones won’t renew their lease automatically when the re-auth period hits and have to be rebooted…I’m over it all.

                              <span>Hey all, I have recently been trying to dig myself out of the MSP space and into an internal position. I have recently been offered a job at a company where I would be the sole IT provider for location with 55+ people. Doing minimal server and Networking and help desk tickets.
 I currently work at MSP doing level two and three work. Maybe getting a promotion in the next year and was just approved for a pretty big raise. I&#x27;m not sure if this would be beneficial to my career so I was hoping to get some insight. 
 New job:
 Pros:
 * Not an MSP
 * 20k pay increase
 * Seems to be within my wheelhouse
 * Ownership of IT things ( Not MSP) 
 Cons:
 * Only IT for that office. No team or boss to bounce ideas off of. Not getting a great collaborative feeling from the remote IT team
 * Will be doing EVERYTHING. Powerpoints to network troubleshooting
 * Might be a step down technically speaking
 * No Work from home whatsoever. 
 Current job:
 Pros:
 * Job security
 * Great boss and team
 * I know what I&#x27;m doing, no learning curve.
 * Completely remote 
 Cons:
 * Overworked
 * Pay could be better
 * Feeling stagnant. 
 This would be the perfect position if I knew I had a good team and boss and had the chace to work from home some. I&#x27;m itching to get out of the MSP World and this is the first thing that&#x27;s come my way in a long time.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s the case. I got 2 websites: 
 www.company.com potato.company.com
 Need to set up a 3rd site with domain:
 test.potato.company.com
 If I simply create a new zone called &quot;potato.company.com&quot; and add &quot;test&quot; sub domain to it, Then potato.company.com stops working.
 What is the proper way of setting this up in windows dns server ?

                              <span>Hey guys, was wondering if such a thing exists and if so if there’s any recommendations from the great community of r/sysadmin for a platform that can host powershell scripts to execute on command for end user machines? Currently I have a lot of scripts on my laptop which I then manually enter the machine hostname for, and then enter the creds to authenticate on and I kinda want something a bit more streamlined

 The practice that I work for has expressed a few times that it would be nice if I were to get certified as a PACS admin, and, when talking with their CEO he was speaking really highly of the PMP and said he would be willing to sign off on my hourly requirement. 
 For perspective, I have 2 years of experience. My sole goal is to make as much money as I can by being as valuable as I can, while also not working 90 hours a week. I&#x27;m not in it for me. I don&#x27;t need a new car or a nice watch. I just want to provide for my children. 
 Outside of &quot;depends what you are interested in&quot;, which direction would make me the most marketable/valuable?

 I’ve verified that it has the proper mic selected, but can’t seem to solve issue. 
 Anyone else experienced this?

 Our Linux team has a ton of monitoring tools that greatly increased their efficiency and i was wondering if something like that exists for m365 based software. Both tenant wide and maybe service based? Like getting a warning when user A is nearly running out of space on outlook or user B uploading an ungodly amount of files to OneDrive or something like that. Do tools like that exist?

 Last year the response was &quot;We just need to figure where they fit into the team&quot;
 This year it was &quot;We are looking into it&quot; followed by &quot;We realise another member of staff is needed&quot; followed by &quot;The stats don&#x27;t support it&quot;.
 All patching is falling on me as well as DR&#x27;s, whilst getting complained at as an infrastructure engineer that the 1st line queue is a mess. I try to escalate stuff to my manager and get complained at that he is too busy. Team meetings are held after work finishes (well the couple we have had this year are).
 So after a two week holiday, I just decided enough was enough. Fired out my CV and it took me 2 weeks to find a job.

 HPE have an official Q&amp;A that says you can put a Gen9 in Gen8, but can&#x27;t find anything newer.

 Building manual, scheduled alerts on Splunk, I don&#x27;t feel very confident I&#x27;ve covered all possible attack scenarios.
 An NDR with its dynamic, real time alerts seems the perfect missing piece. (We already have EDR, email security, proxy etc)
 My only question is, does an NDR actually give you a peace of mind that it will block any possible malicious network activity?
 Has it been an added value for you?

 I have a 2-server PKI environment, with an offline root CA and one subordinate/issuing intermediate CA. I am trying to request a certificate from one of my template in the issuing CA, however I keep getting an error &quot; The certificate request could not be submitted to the certification authority&quot;. RPC server is unavailable.
 I&#x27;ve turned of firewall on the server and the CA server for tests, but requests still failing. 
 Any clues how I can resolve this?

                              <span>I recently got my info systems bba and am wondering with no experience is it worth getting the a+ cert by comp Tia? Maybe the network plus would be better though.
 I found an online course for the a+ cert. Its 92 lectures and it would take a bit to sit through though it’s only 15 dollars. I don’t know if it’s worth the time or to try and get a interview now without any certs.

                              <span>Could you actually increase your IT job security by 
  
discovering fields/tasks that can be useful to the organization and brings more profit, convenience, efficiency etc
 that no one else is doing, knows about, has a plan to or knows how to
 introduce the tasks to management/executive and convince them to approve you to take on the tasks
 Once approved and deployed, develop and improve it to be critical to the organization mission -make the org to rely on it. It could be software, operational tasks, report generation etc
 voila you are no longer easy to fireable -not that you want to be the only one that knows it all because you can still share the skills with others/teach them.

                              <span>Background: I administer a simple Active Directory domain where all joined computers run Windows Server 2012r2, and the domain includes a database running SQL Server 2014.
 I changed a domain-wide GPO from a “never” account lockout threshold to “3 invalid login attempts” in Computer Config\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies. 
 A few hours after pushing the new account lockout policy, our developer discovered that a SQL Server Login (not a Windows/domain user) was unable to authenticate via SSMS or other methods (connection strings, etc). after multiple attempts with an incorrect password. Error Log for MSSQLSERVER said Event ID 18456: Login failed for ‘redacted’. Reason: “The account is currently locked out. The system administrator can unlock it.”
 The SQL Login lockouts stopped happening after I reverted the GPO to a “never” lockout threshold.
 QUESTION: Is it possible that the domain GPO account lockout policy is responsible for locking that SQL login?
 I assumed that the GPO only acted on domain users, but all the evidence suggests that’s either exactly what happened, or that’s one heck of a coincidence.
 Maybe if a policy is applied to Domain Computers, it also applies to the Database Server and therefore to SQL logins? Doesn’t sound right… but I’m at a loss!
 Happy to clarify or add any additional info I might’ve forgotten. 
 Any insight would be tremendously appreciated, as my boss insists I understand exactly why this happens, and I desperately want to. thank you!

 I am a System Engineer 3 currently. Our new director that took over a few months back has decided to move me to Cybersecurity Analyst position, since we do not have a security group. He wants me to build up the security group but I told him I believe going from an engineer to analyst would be a demotion. He said pay and everything stays the same but its not sitting right with me. Is it just me over thinking this is a demotion?

                              <span>Hello, fellow Redditors.
 We&#x27;re currently facing some challenges with our large-scale mixed deployment of Switches and Wireless Access Points from Cisco and Aruba, and I&#x27;m hoping to gather some valuable insights and suggestions from the community.
 Our network infrastructure consists of both Cisco and Aruba devices, and the main difficulties we&#x27;re encountering are as follows:
  
Different UI: Managing the network becomes a bit of a hassle due to the varying UIs. Aruba uses Airwave, while Cisco relies on DNAC. This disparity in UIs makes it time-consuming for us to navigate and configure both platforms efficiently. 
 Lack of Central Management and Monitoring: We&#x27;re struggling with the absence of a centralized solution for managing and monitoring devices across both platforms. It would be ideal to have a single management system that allows us to seamlessly control and monitor both Cisco and Aruba devices.
 Single NAC Solution: We&#x27;re in need of a Network Access Control (NAC) solution that is compatible with both Cisco and Aruba devices. This NAC solution should be fully functional and comply with standards such as RADIUS and TACACS+. Specifically, we&#x27;re looking for features like MAC profiling for dynamic MAC registration, BYOD portals, and guest portals. Additionally, it should support both wired and wireless 802.1x authentication and provide administrative authentication for Aruba and Cisco devices.
  
Open to any suggestions or recommendations that can help us address these challenges. If you have faced similar situations or successfully integrated Cisco and Aruba devices in a mixed deployment, your expertise would be greatly appreciated!
 Please share your experiences, or any solutions you might know of that could help us overcome these issues. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>For the second time in about 8 years of running a pair of LTM VEs under ESXi (vsphere cluster with Dell M640s, all dual-attached 10GE ports on VDS), I had one LTM VE &quot;lose&quot; its control plane but the data plane was still forwarding packets. The peer noticed the first one wasn&#x27;t sending heartbeats, so it tried to acquire the resources and tell the first one to release resources. The first one stayed online, and the result was both were stealing each other&#x27;s TCP sessions, causing random session resets, until I forcibly rebooted the first LTM VE node.
 This could have been prevented if the TMOS supported either sending a &#x27;power off the peer&#x27; command to VCSA, or if the ESXi/LTM-VE combination was capable of having a watchdog configured, where the hypervisor would reset the VM if it failed to receive any watchdog heartbeats after some period of time.
 Are either of these possible? We&#x27;re running TMOS 15.1.x, but can upgrade to 16.x if we need to.

                              <span>(Sorry if this is not relevant to this sub-reddit). I want to simulate a network with N number of nodes, could be Ubuntu or any VM that are connected (virtually of course) and have some open-source routing daemon running on them (I am thinking FRR ?) that supports BGP. I would then like the nodes to advertise their loopback IPs to the other nodes (could be all eBGP sessions) and then, say a head VM that can monitor these BGP sessions on all nodes every hour or so to make sure the sessions are all in Established state. I wouldnt want to use simulators like NS-3 or so and wanted to create the VMs and the connections between them on my own. Any suggestions if this is possible and where I should start looking from? Since I wouldn&#x27;t need GUI for controlling these VMs, I am thinking using something like kvm to launch multiple VMs on my laptop and then take it from there? Also for the open-source routing daemon, does FRR sound good? Thanks

                              <span>What do you think about firewalls like pfSense and OPESense, now that NGFWs extist? They are way cheaper, compared to Fortigate and Cisco; which makes them quite attractive for a small business that just needs a solid firewall with VPN support- and without a lot of money for networking equipment... With that being said, the firewall will be protecting pretty much all the company &quot;value&quot;, represented in a couple of source control servers.

                              <span>Given a setup like this: snipboard.io/TrJVaH.jpg
 In the first step, let&#x27;s assume two separate DSL lines going into two separate routers (VyOS machines). Both DSL lines provide public WAN IP via DHCP. VyOS boxes are configured to use NAT. On the inside VRRP is used for router redundancy.
 Now my concern is is NAT and its connection tracking. When a router handover occurs, all the connections will slowly have to time out (I believe). Is this the best that one can do?
 Now here is VRRP connection tracking sync. But I don&#x27;t see how this would help since both boxes have a different WAN address. So even if all connection tracking is synced, responses from the internet will fail on handover because responses are sent to the old WAN address.
 ​
 The only way how I see this working if the internet somehow sees the same WAN for both routers. How can this work?
 Question 1: Let&#x27;s assume we have no own IP network but only the two dynamically assigned WAN addresses by the two ISP. Is the sketched setup (without connection-tracking sync) the best that can be done?
 ​
 Question 2: Suppose we do have a /24 that is routed by the two ISPs. Now the public IPs are, say, 192.0.2.100 and 192.168.0.2.101 respectively. How would would one build a redundant router for an internal NAT network with that config? 
 The only way I can see this working is assigning the same public IP to the VyOS machine (some sort of &quot;multicast&quot;) but that&#x27;s of course not permissible. Or add another box in front of the two VyOS routers that performs NAT. But then there&#x27;s again a single point of failure and no point in having redundant routers behind it.

                              <span>Okay, so I was always the guy who told everybody that SA Lifetimes should match on both sides of IPSec tunnel.
 That was until last week when I was troubleshooting periodic downtimes on a tunnel that I just moved from ASA to our new Palo Alto. Remote side is a Virtual Private Gateway in our contractor&#x27;s AWS VPC.
 They were occuring at random times when rekeying Phase 2 SA.
 Sometimes the tunnel was up for two days and then suddenly dropped. Sometimes it dropped after just 3 hours. (Phase 1 - 8 Hours, Phase 2 - 1 Hour)
 The worst thing was that only Phase 2 SA went down and the AWS endpoint wasn&#x27;t able to deal with that so it always meant that nothing could pass through the tunnel until the IKE SA expired or until I cleared the SAs manually.
 Finally I got some time to troubleshoot and enabled debugs on PA. I also requested logs from the guy operating the AWS infrastructure (not a networking guy).
 After I had a look at these logs, I figured out that sometimes it would occur that we started rekeying the Phase 2 SA at the same time which eventually caused the new and the old SA to get deleted on PA.
 I ended up changing the P2 SA Lifetime so it&#x27;s longer than configured lifetime on the other side and I have no problems since because only one side initiates the rekey now...
 Never stop learning...

                              <span>Some background on me. I am currently a senior network engineer with a few years of experience and have CCNA, Sec+ and JNCIA certs. Also I am in the northern Virginia/ DC Area. 
 So my question is would it be more beneficial for me to spend the next couple years continuing to work my way up to the CCIE or do a masters degree ? The program I am looking at is a Masters of Telecommunications at George Mason University. My alternate plan is to just knock out a masters degree at WGU in 6 months and then quickly return to working on certs again. 
 Any input in appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 Hello All,
 The company that I work for has acquired a new MPLS Circuit from AT&amp;T at both our Primary and DR DCs that have been active for a few weeks now. Our Primary DC is hosted at a colocation and our DR is hosted in Azure and is connected via Netbond. Yesterday, we received a new MPLS Circuit also from AT&amp;T for one of our larger branch offices. This would now make a total of three CERs that are running on this new MPLS VPN from AT&amp;T (Primary DC CER, Azure ER, and Remote Office CER).
 Both DCs and Remote Office MPLS Circuits are l…</span>

                              <span>Hi so as the title says I&#x27;m looking for an android tablet with a stylus... as a network engineer, more and more if finding I have to make diagrams in Visio. The main problem is that I have is that i just get verbally told on what someone wants or if I&#x27;m trying to trouble shoot I like to normally draw the flow out on paper. So I&#x27;m looking to use it to make those initial diagrams I can sit with someone to get the &quot;cigarette packet&quot; drawing before making it look professional in Visio. Also I&#x27;ll be using it to take notes from meetings and learning new subjects etc... The only game I would play on it is something like RuneScape 3 (Yes I&#x27;m still a kid at heart :D)
 I was hoping the Pixel Tablet would be a good option but since I&#x27;m UK based I feel like the £599 price tag compared to the $499 US price tag is kinda a **** take... Also I dont want the stand thing.
 I am now Looking at the OnePlus Pad with the Stylo Pen which would come to £550.
 So Question is the OnePlus a good option or is there something else I should be looking at? (No Apple Please...)

 This is CAT6A F/UTP cable between the same two locations (patch panel  double outlet). A PoE switch is on one end and an AP is at the other end. 
 On the first link (333-1), the AP powers up but links at 10Mbps, on the second port it links up fine at 1Gbps.
 I know this probably means the pair 3/6,7/8 are busted, but why did it still PASS a fluke test?
 Is there any docs to learn how to interpret these results in general?

                              <span>I have 2 Servers (Domain Controllers) located on the different VLANs and Subnets but on the same site so they are basically behind the same firewall but seperated with VLANs.
 Host A pings Host B while Host B pings Host A.
 The result of Host A is Avg 0ms while the result of Host B is Avg 89ms tested with 20 pings.
 The Servers are virtualized in vsphere on 2 different hosts and the vsphere environment is connected to the bladecenter while the bladecenter is connected to vc switch which is connected to the 2 core switches. The Core switches are connected each to a firewall in active/passive mode where the VLAN of the 2 Servers terminates. The 2 physical ESX hosts are on different switch. Physical ESX Host A is connected to Core Switch 1 while physical ESX Host is connected to Core Switch 2. The Core Switches are connected with a Trunk Port of 2x 40 Gbit/s.
 The ping was executed in the same time on each host.
 Can someone explain what could be wrong here?

                              <span>VPN to which I connect to is in US and I am in EU. I connect to VM over remote desktop and connection is stable but slow. My router is connected to 4G internet and I was thinking of trying to connect a phone to USB tethering and use two internet connections for load balancing. Can load balancing router feature increase VPN speed?

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I work at Faang company as an NDE , I have been in an ops team since one year and have absolutely not liked it since day 1 , I wanted to work more on larger scale design and architecture, my manager said that it would come as we go on so I rolled up my sleeves and delivered as much as I could , I got an exceeded expectations rating and very good reputation , but I don’t like doing 90% what I do , it’s been a year now so I had a discussion with my skip and he told me he could move me to the engineering team as soon as hiring freeze is over , but that could take a year or more I have no guarantee ,I don’t want to stay in ops anymore I have the opportunity to make a lateral move to another team in the org that is a mix of networking, cloud and automation but I am afraid ( I think it’s FOMO) that if I move I would blow my chance of ever being in the engineering team, what are you guys thoughts and advice on this ?

                              <span>College campuses should be safe harbors for a wide range of opinions and arguments but instead many universities are pushing to silence speakers. While some schools are calling for censorship and content warnings, others are fighting the progressive notion that speech can be violence.  We speak with an education expert about the state of free speech on college campuses.

                              <span>Greetings, wizards of r/cisco! Buckle up, because we&#x27;re about to embark on an epic, slightly tongue-in-cheek journey through the wilderness of Cisco networking solutions. Brace yourselves, because it&#x27;s Traditional Cisco vs. Meraki.
 Round 1: Setup &amp; Ease of Use
 Traditional Cisco solutions are like those massive Lego sets with a gazillion pieces. They are fun (if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing), flexible, and the outcome can be magnificent. But you&#x27;ll need an entire weekend, a big table, and maybe a magnifying glass.
 On the other hand, Meraki is like your friendly IKEA furniture set. Open the box, follow the colorful, wordless instructions, and voila! You&#x27;ve got a bookcase... or was it a table? Either way, it was easy, right? That&#x27;s Meraki for you.
 Round 2: Flexibility &amp; Control

                              <span>Running a small operation here, with a couple of stacked Dell S4810&#x27;s as our core switches.
 To modernize things a bit, I got a quote for Arista 7280SR3-48YC8 for about $25K a pop. But it looks like I can easily get a refurb Dell S5148F-ON for a tiny fraction of the cost. I was frankly surprised that the used price has come down this low, when new units from these vendors still easily fetch in the high $10K&#x27;s and beyond, with huge lead times.
 Am I missing something here? It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m asking to compare Arista and Netgear… :)

                              <span>Next month, I and a couple colleagues will be on a media job out of town where lots of our work (editing) will be done in our own hotel room. Our network setup usually involves a subnet which gets its internet connection through hotel rooms&#x27; wired ethernet jacks. (The subnet is for a network drive). However, this hotel we are staying in particular has no wired ethernet ports in its rooms, only (good) Wi-Fi through a seemingly well-installed Ruckus AP system. Speeds are already solid and in the hundreds of megabits. No captive portals. I know all of this because I was there a few months ago.
 I&#x27;m looking to experiment and create my own sub-network that obtains its internet uplink wirelessly from the hotel&#x27;s Wi-Fi network. The machines don&#x27;t have Wi-Fi capability, so I&#x27;d rather try first to accomplish internet uplink on the subnet level. Of course this would involve a device that can connect to the hotel&#x27;s SSID and act as a wireless-to-wired bridge. The first device that comes to mind would be a wireless repeater, but to me that sounds cheap. Would that work? Does the Unifi line support this? Or is there other hardware that can do this?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Had a lot of udld issues recently, some which only take one uplink down but others that take both links down. Results in needing to physical go around and console or reboot switches to get them back online.
 These issues occur during some distro switch upgrades or the other day when we had a switch have a bug. So no true lasting unidirectional links.
 Would like to have autorecovery of the errdisabled state but concerned about any potential impact of a udld event that lasts more than a few minutes and results in bringing a unidirectionally link online and it causing a problem before the udld timers shut it down.
 Using rpvst which usually converges in a few seconds but my understanding is that since both sides cannot detect bpdu that it would revert to basic stp timers of 30-50 seconds. Any downsides to bringing a unidrectional link back up with recovery? Would spanning tree timers prevent an actual issue?

                              <span>So the Dell S4810-ON switch doesn&#x27;t allow you to load the FTOS on it from dell, it says it supports the Big Networks Switch Light and Cumulus Linux 2.x - I have the Switch Light OS on it right now, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to support vlans, or route traffic between ports. I&#x27;m looking for old downloads of Cumulus Linux, or Switch Light Configuration examples (I assume I just have it mis-configured to not route traffic).
 Does anyone have a download location for the arm Cumulus Linux 2.x NOS or advice on getting Switch Light OS to route traffic between the ports? (Admin Interface/SSH works fine, just not the SFP+ ports)

                              <span>I need to design a flyaway rack that is going to highly remote locations to support up to 35 work stations (predominantly on wifi). I want to deploy 4 starlink dishes (we have the business dish) and combine them into one switch which has a number of APS on them.
 My main sticking point is what I use to load balance the 4 starlink networks. I have not got any experience doing this and need some advice on hardware solutions for this.
 Thanks
 Edit - I so far have:
 Starlink, Dream Machine Pro, 4 APS, Ups.
 All is configured and works well, I just need to add more network capacity and we have calculated that 3-4 Starlinks will do the trick.

 the 25G link between Core Stack C9500 and hypeflex node HX220C-M6S did not come up . The 25GBASE Cable 3 is totally working. I have checked the ports from Hyperflex and C9500 , everything is fine.
 I May have read somowhere that this issue is related to FEC config . Both ports need to be on cl74. I appreciate if you can help me.

                              <span>I set up 2 CRS305 switches a few years ago and I recall testing file transfers then and I was getting 800-900MBs with large VM files.
 Not sure if it was the cause but a few weeks ago I upgraded to the newest RouterOS firmware.
 While still in the RouterOS I also upgraded the RouterBOARD fireware to 6.49.7.
 I&#x27;ve tried switching to the switch SwOS and updated the SwOS version to 2.13 but it did not help.
 Not sure if it means anything but the main switch got stuck a few times when switching to the SwOS. Power cycle did not work. I had the same IP address in both configs but ended up using the reset button after the power was back. It did the same thing when trying to update the SwOS firmware. ???
 I have a simple setup with a few workstations and a laptop. They have very fast SSDs that can copy to each other in the same workstation at around 4-5GBs and to themselves at around 1-2GBs.
 I used the /int bridge port print command and all the ports have HW hardware on.
 __________________________________
 I&#x27;ve looked at it a bit more and with workstation1, workstation2 and the laptop all on the same CRS305 switch. Both WS1 and the Laptop get 1.00-1.02GBs and the Windows file copy graph looks flat with only very small dips. Looks really good. But if I copy from the WS1 to the Laptop or the Laptop to WS1 I get around 400-500MBs and it&#x27;s all over the place.
 WS1 and the Laptop are using Ethernet ports and Ethernet SFP modules on the CRS305 switch. WS2 has Fiber SFP modules. Not sure if that matters.
 ​
 Here is a video copying first on the laptop in the RDP window from WS2, then on WS1 from WS2.
 Then from WS1 to the Laptop and then from the laptop to WS1. The last one, laptop to WS1 is always the slowest to start, it goes up slowly.
 I just don&#x27;t get how/why copying from WS2 is rock solid on both but then between WS1 and the laptop is so bad.
 All three PCs have SSDs that can read and write over 3GBs.

                              <span>I’ve been in networking for almost a decade now. I still enjoy it but what gets me is how much specialized our work is. By that I mean you’re pretty much bound to the brands your company has. You’re going to be a Cisco guy or a checkpoint guy, etc. it’s just frustrating to keep up w these things, and worse if it gets replaced and you sort of start all over again and learn how this “new” tech is implemented differently 
 I guess my question is, what would be a worthwhile networking career path that’s the most vendor agnostic? I’m thinking python/automation but I’m not really up to date w what else is out there.

                              <span>In what cases should we consider Ruckus ICX8200-PREM-LIC L3 Premium license?This enables:
 · IPv4 and IPv6 dynamic routes· OSPF v2, v3· PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, PIM-DM, PIM passive (IPv4, IPv6)· PBR· Virtual Route Redundancy Protocol VRRP (IPv4)· VRRP v3 (IPv6)· VRRP-E(IPv4/IPv6)· VRF (IPv4
 We will be using only one router/firewall, 15 switches distributed in 11 racks (a few stacked switches), 80 APs... Do we need OSPF? And as for PIM, we might be using multicast for the video surveillance system...
 No linked sites.... From another thread:
  
OSPF will make sense only if you have 2 links to and from the site. Even then I would recommend making it a totally stub site just to optimise the routing table.
  
Your thoughts?

                              <span>Hello.
 I have a switch (DCN S5750E-26X-SI). On one port I receive 10 vlans.
 Now, depending on MAC inside each of those vlans I need to put this MAC in vlan 3 or 4.
 From what I read, for MAC-based vlan input needs to be untagged.
 Is my only option to bridge those 10 vlans (I don&#x27;t need them separate, I just receive them like that form outside) then put this bridge on access an loop it to another port with MAC-based VLAN enabled?

                              <span>Hi,
 Looking for a direction to make a self organizing network that can handle dynamic multiple gateways.
 Imagine when a group of friends get together their phones would talk, confirm which has the best 5G service and all use that.
 or If no 5G, the next best available.
 and if one of them has run out of data for the month, can use any of their connection.
 (yes, ignoring security and all that. these would all be sharing on purpose and with full knowledge of the owners/users/etc/etc)
 I don&#x27;t imagine phones being able to do it, but is there a routing protocol that can handle dynamic gateway selection along with path selection?
 Thanks!

That made me chose this field. But enquring some people i know in this field told me to take some other courses related to cloud networking/computing since the field is moving more towards cloud based. The courses that they have suggested me are cyber security courses and cloud computing courses. As someone who just turned 25, i dont wish to spend another 3 years and land a job after 5 years. Really confused and scared of wasting time. What would be your suggestion? Is getting a CCIE certification would land a job? Is it future proof?

                              <span>Hey all, i&#x27;m volunteering to put together a POS system for a yearly neighborhood outdoor event and looking for advice on wifi there. The area I&#x27;m working with is about 200 feet and on the edge of it one of the businesses has volunteered their internet connection.
 Last year there were problems with connectivity, people are made of meat and water and the signal wouldn&#x27;t reach well during peak hours. Also there are just enough people that cell signals get jammed up, so it looks like a hotspot is out. We want to make sure that the square readers stay working. 
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking: I have a Linkstar I&#x27;ve been messing around with for shit and grins. Get a cheap point to point pair of antennas to go from the building with internet to a high spot above the beer garden and into to the linkstar. From there get a few fire tablets, reflash the firmware to get rid of the ads, and boom. 
 This is all on a budget, I&#x27;ll probably go out of pocket on it since it&#x27;s a non-profit thing. Is this the right way to go about this?

                              <span>What are your thoughts on what makes a good network document? How about a good diagram? What makes you look at a document and be like &quot;damn THAT&#x27;s a good document. I want my docs to look like that.&quot;
 Any standard outline you follow? How much detail do you put in versus assume that the reader should know the information?
 I&#x27;m in a very sad situation where I am forced to use power point as a technical knowledge dissemination tool, whereas a technical white paper would be more appropriate delivery mechanism. There&#x27;s just too much information to fit into the slides, and the people reviewing these slides are not all network engineers/architects. (I normally write with markdown and asciidoc and convert to PDF)
 I&#x27;ve brought this matter up with the management, but they insist on using power point. It&#x27;s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
 I&#x27;ve tried to scope the slides, by stating which slides are primarily intended for a more technical audience versus just a general one, however the problem is less-technical management loves to interject with their questions when they come across content they don&#x27;t understand.
 Others want to just take my slide deck, be able to look at some bullet points and get a basic idea, yet still be briefed on finer details of a design. It&#x27;s hard to find a balance.
 To me, power point is a visual aide for me to deliver a presentation, and a guide on where to get more detailed information. Not a zero to hero manual.

                              <span>Hey all, solo IT jack of all trades here. I&#x27;ve got a couple users who demand using a Macbook and therefore have to use Parallels if they want to be able to still access some of the applications used at our business. For some users, the only application they need from Windows is actually a RemoteApp from a third party company application that is only supported/installed on Windows. We do not own or manage this server. I don&#x27;t have admin access to the server and the remote company claims that there is no way for the RemoteApp to work on the Mac despite Microsoft having support for RemoteApps with their MacOS Remote Desktop App. In fact, I can even RDP into the server (but our accounts don&#x27;t have desktop access so they disconnect immediately), and if I setup a remote app with the info I have about their server I can see/list the RemoteApps but when I attempt to launch them I get Error code 0x104 (Unable to connect).
 ​
 I actually still have full access to an older server that we used to use RemoteApp with, so I might be able to learn something by looking at it.
 ​
 TLDR: Company claims their &#x27;custom&#x27; RemoteApp won&#x27;t work on the Mac even though it&#x27;s a glorified RDP connection. I say no but am not sure where to start. I have the RDP user credentials, server IP, and app name. I may be able to deduce the server filepath to the application as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been told that one of the skills I really need to work on in my career is stress management. How do you guys keep calm when troubleshooting a major outage even if you don&#x27;t know where to start with the issue?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at the end of my rope here and wanted to see if anyone would be willing to help me troubleshoot this very strange issue we are seeing in our environment.
 Background
 I help administer a hybrid environment with both on-prem AD and AAD. We also use GCDS to sync user profiles over to google for gmail and other google apps. Staff use MS SAML SSO for authentication with google.
 After the schooldude f* up we instructed users who had been affected to use a self-service password reset link that had been implemented years ago. This link goes to our internal ADFS server and resets their password in our local AD.
 Suspected Cause
 After the password reset some of these users have found their chromium profile broken. I say chromium because the issues persist in both Chrome and Edge despite all o…</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 I manaeg a network of abiout 50vms (primarily an RDS farm) on a Hyper-V cluster. The network is physically isolated from our workstation netowork. My access is via RDP to management VM with RSAT installed or console login via RMM tools. Where possible all tasks are performed from the RSAT either via GUI or Powershell remoting. 
 ​
 I am trying to get my head around the best way to manage accounts when its primarly just me (and one other to help when i am away). 
 I currently just login to any machine with my DA account and dont use the web for anything. I have a non da account that i use if i need to access the RDS farm as a user and peform non DA tasks (using the software we host in the farm) 
 ​
  
Should i be logging in to servers as a local admin user only? 
 Log into RSAT as a standard user and always use &quot;runas&quot; to lauch managment tools. 
 Should i have more than one &quot;Admin&quot; account? RDS admin, Hyper-V admin, FileServer admin etc? 
  
I get on teams to only give permnission to perform the tasks required etc. I find it harder to work out thge balance of security and practicality for a single SysAdmin

Something I have always struggled with was the process of rotating the password for the service accounts that we use in IIS. 
 You may ask, why don&#x27;t you just use app-passthrough? Some apps and vdirs use a UNC path to a share for their home directories and app passthrough won&#x27;t work for not only those, but for the parents of those vdirs and apps.
 Our IIS configs have several root/parent apps and under those we have about a three dozen child apps and vdirs. About a half dozen app pools to silo worker processes for different apps and sites (balancing between performance and isolated memory space). After my efforts to script this proved futile, I searched the internet…</span>

 Call comes in from a director of a client today saying her computer “was doing funny things”. Conversation progressed and we were told paragraphs disappeared from a word document and then emails started being deleted from her inbox. 
 Our initial response was to quarantine the machine, see if there was anything odd flagged in EDR or firewall and then proceed from there. Couldn’t find anything. 
 Turns out she dropped some of her lunch in her keyboard and the delete key got stuck down.
 Happy Friday!

                              <span>We have a bunch of those crappy Dell docking stations. A mix of the old square ones and the newer rectangular ones. Square ones keep dying, so whenever we find a user with a square one we just replace it with a new rectangular one 
 User was having a problem with their dock today, so I asked them on Teams, “please send me a picture of your dick”
 Didn’t hear back for a few hours, but noticed the user is still online. Went back and looked at the message I sent…
 I’m not sure what happens now, but I think I’m either getting into a relationship, or getting fired and sued. 
 Definitely Friday.

They insert their smart card and no certificates are pulled into the local store so nothing works. But if they go to ANY other computer and insert their smart card the certs show up and they are able to use it. 
 I&#x27;ve checked the Certificate Propagation service and its running correctly (to my knowledge). Kind of at a loss on how to continue troubleshooting this since there seems to be no errors associated with it that I&#x27;ve found. Has anyone ran into this problem?

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I wanted to start a discussion on the topic of whether customers need Web Application Firewalls to protect their Web (SaaS) applications. We are large educational institution
 I understand with SaaS model, the responsibility for securing the underlying infrastructure and platform lies with the service provider, while the customer is responsible for securing their own data and access.
 But sometimes customer needs to put additional security measures such as WAF to prevent from threats like DDoS attacks.
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and experiences regarding this topic What do you to protect Web SaaS apps.

                              <span>Was working as a Jr. SysAdmin for two years at a small insurance firm and just started a new gig as a SysAdmin L3 at a commercial bank in my state. I’ve almost been here a month and just starting to feel comfortable for the most part.
 I was brought on to replace the current L3 as he will be leaving for a government gig, was told he wouldn’t be leaving until the Fall so we can work together to transfer knowledge and responsibilities.
 We found out yesterday he is actually leaving for the new gig in a little less than 2 WEEKS. I got 5 projects that haven’t even really been started yet dropped on me and a bunch of meetings to follow them up. I was already still getting used to the environment and now this has just put me in a very anxious spot, feeling imposter syndrome hardcore now.
 Any advice from people in this position before?

                              <span>So Adobe Acrobat Pro license cost for business jumped from around $16.99 to $23.99 USD.
 That is a $8 USD bump.
 Which is an approximate 41% price increase.
 Of course trying to pay for an annual license yields no discount either.
 To justify the increase, they said this:
 *Why is the price increasing? Adobe Acrobat Pro has improved significantly over the last few years with the addition of many new features, including:
 Liquid mode, which automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens.
 Integrations with Google Suite, Box, and Microsoft that enable customers to collaborate and make changes to PDFs directly from Microsoft Teams.
 Expansion to new surfaces that allow customers to access our PDF tools on the web and mobile.
 New e-signature features that streamline workflows and eliminate the need for in-person and “wet” signatures that can slow business down.*
 Reason 1 and 3 should not have been used as a reason. That is like saying, we changed the template on our website to HTML5 and it should look okay now on your phone.
 So at what point does the price gouging stop? It seems like were being charged for common updates.
 The e-signatures, I can understand. Fighting DocuSign. DocuSign can lick my butt. But something tells me this will be removed in the future from the Pro license and used as an add-on service. Like the way Microsoft tells you, any person can call in to your Teams meeting. But you need a conference bridge, and only after you pay for the conference license of $2.50 per user. That pools your minutes together. Which can be chewed up by just a single user who mistakenly uses the call me at this number feature.

                              <span>Hi all,
 hoping someone might be able to offer some advice....
 we are looking at standardising our Windows 10 start menu, nothing major, just certain apps pinned to start under folders. This works fine.
 If we then follow M$&#x27; guide on adding the taskbar layout to the same xml file, it breaks the startmenu layout and ignores the taskbar changes.
 if we take the taskbar section out, all works again as it should.
 using GPO, we copy the layoutmodification.xml to the default user profile, and also to a local folder (c:\scripts), without the taskbar settings it works fine, but with them in it all stops working, so new users get a startmenu with no items pinned and the default taskbar.
 ​
 ​
 the XML file with the taskbar settings, looks like this

                              <span>I just started as the local IT support for a medium-sized manufacturer. Their environment has no structure that I can see, or at least it&#x27;s very limited (a few VLANS and a domain). I&#x27;m new to running the show, and I would greatly appreciate any advice on where to begin to try to get this place in order.
 Most of the machines are on Windows 11 right now, with some of the servers on 2012 and some I&#x27;m not even sure of. We have a handful of legacy applications which require some *really* old software to run, and I&#x27;m hoping to sandbox all of that in a VM eventually.
 We have multiple different backup solutions, some of them local and some of them are cloud-based. All of that is automated already.
 I&#x27;m working on a hardware inventory, as what we had was woefully inadequate and so I&#x27;m not actually 100% certain of what&#x27;s present beyond what I can walk around and see.
 Our server room is unsecured; Anyone can just walk right in with no fob and no swipe.
 We do have a corporate help desk from the company that purchased this location, but they primarily just manage purchasing decisions and provisioning.
 So, again, in terms of where to begin, right now I have my eyes firmly on the security of our server room and the hardware inventory, followed by getting hosts on some kind of naming convention and then the same for users... I&#x27;m sure there are a hundred more important things I could and should be thinking about, so please do feel free to shout at me what you think those are.
 ​
 Thank you!
 (For those of you who are rolling your eyes, please know that I already searched the sub for similar posts and have read through quite a few of them)

                              <span>I made a simple suggestion to a professor regarding the lack of modules that cover servers / potentially systems administration, and to my surprise it was turned into an actual third year undergraduate module at my university.
 This module will be taught over a ten week period with a one-hour lecture per week, switching to a more practical format later in the term. The professor is quite familiar with Linux and distributed computing, but is currently still outlining the module and taking suggestions;
 This is a final year module in a bachelors degree in computer science, and students should be somewhat familiar with Linux by this point. What type of content would you recommend in a module like this?

 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at the new Outlook. While it has some improvements, it is missing many features that have existed for years. It reminds me of the Windows 11 Start Menu - pretty and new, but far less functional than the old version.
 My list does not consider GUI changes (because they are subjective) and ignores bugs/crashes/slowness of the new Outlook.
 Here&#x27;s what I found so far...
 New features:
  
Pin/Unpin Email
 Snooze email
 Density has 3 choices instead of 2
 Can preview message text next to subject in message list
 Board
 Integrates MS Loop cloud components
  
Features removed (in no particular order):
  
Customize ribbon
 Ribbon cannot be hidden
 Choose columns to show in message list
 Separation of categories from subject in message list
 Shared categories cannot have color

 I did a quick reddit search and did not see a reference to this issue.

                              <span>Hello,
 In advance I would like to thank anyone who has any thoughts on this.
 I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out unable to fix it. But I&#x27;m no Azure admin, when it comes to troubleshooting. Just a guy doing his best.
 We have 6 users onboarded onto a file share in Azure files. They access it from onsite/wherever they are. The storage account itself is &quot;StorageV2 (general purpose v2)&quot; &quot;Hot Tier&quot;.
 The files stored in here are company Excel files. Some of these files are able to get into excess of 50-100MB. With lots of links, formulas, etc.
 The issue that is occurring seems primarily occur when accessing files larger then 1 or 2 MB.
 The issue being that when a larger excel file is accessed the windows file explorer (explorer.exe) will hang. Sometimes it will return to function within seconds, but it generally needs to be closed via task manager. 
 It is replicable on multiple computers, so I do not think it is a local issue, and occurs both offsite on home internet, on onsite on our guaranteed 1000/1000 link, I had begun to think it was an IOPS issue but I can&#x27;t find any reports on throttling in the azure monitoring.
 I am at a bit of a loss of where to go to from here, view the process and what it is waiting on in task manager when it is hanging gives me &quot;one or more thread of explorer.exe are waiting to finish network I/O&quot; as if explorer.exe has stopped communicating to the internet, but the file will finish downloading and launch. still.
 I am just absolutely confounded. If anyone has any ideas or could point in the right direction of some information to check out, I would be eternally grateful.

                              <span>Does anybody know labor laws in California that well when it comes to On-Call Policies?
 Recently, my company shifted to a new company, and everything has been so hectic. We&#x27;re about 3 months into the new company, and we still don&#x27;t have a defined on-call policy. My management has been making up rules on the fly as we go, and it&#x27;s really starting to get to us. We went from being restricted, to no restrictions and a loose &quot;1-2 hour response time&quot;. Instead of standby, they were doing block hours, where ticket &#x3D; 2 hour pay, but as of today they&#x27;ve taken that away. We&#x27;ve been told that our overtime for on-call is basically just &quot;whatever we worked&quot;. Except, we&#x27;ve been told that we still need to look at tickets (we get texts for urgent tickets), but we need to decide if we&#x27;ll respond or not. If…</span>

 It&#x27;s definitely GPO related as the event viewer&gt;store&gt; operational, states that it has been blocked by policy (Event ID 4), show error page. 
 All settings in the GPO relating to the store seem correct, but i did find the following in gpresults reporting... @(Microsoft.WindowsStore11606.1001.39.0_x64_8wekyb3d8bbwe?ms-resource://Microsoft.WindowsStore/Resources/StoreTitle) This rule might contain some elements that can not be interpreted by the current version of GPMC reporting module.
 Anyone run into this recently, or have any ideas?

I&#x27;ve only been able to find an ubi while searching the registry.access.redhat.com registry. And if so has anybody had any level of success using the ubi images to sync the full RHEL 8 and 9 repositories?
 edit: The &quot;registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel&quot; image is still available, I meant the equivalent image for RHEL 8/9.

                              <span>I got laid off today due to restructuring in the company. 
 I told my staffing agency. They felt sympathetic and will do what they can to find me another job.
 I’ve been getting interviews, with startups, mid size corporations and even Amazon. Some of these manage to go past the initial phone screen and to the hiring manager. I even had one where I talked to an executive. 
 What am I doing wrong? Is it due to the market? I admit that I know Azure, AD, Office 365 and have used Windows server but don’t have advanced knowledge, especially of server backups. I have 2 years of work experience, a Business IT Management degree and am studying for Network plus (which I have failed many times before sadly)
 How can I conduct myself in interviews better? I do dress up in an office shirt with a tie.
 I am in NYC, which is very competitive, like many other cities.
 How quickly do people get rehired after layoffs? Will a staffing agency help you find another position?

I am a part of a small infra team managing around 1200 onprem servers and we are currently using Solarwinds, however, I feel like there must be many better thought solution… We need to monitor: Esxi hosts VMs (windows, linux) Physical servers Network traffic Etc.
 Edit: forgot to mention that I have worked with zabbix and I absolutely love it! However, management is against open source solutions so when I pushed for it, it got shot down faster than a Russian helicopter flying over Ukraine…

This is all so new that reviews and feedback are little to none, but I found this gem on answers.microsoft.com

 &quot;The feature doesn&#x27;t exist in New Outlook.&quot; 
 I think we&#x27;re all going to have lots of fun when this is pushed to production.

                              <span>I just started as IT Manager at a new company. I spent the first month trying to get a lay of the land because I dropped in almost blind. The previous manager left before I started, so I had to feel my way through the company structure without a guide, or documentation. 
 Today, while the exec director (my supervisor) is out on vacation, she called me into her office and asked me to set her up to access the documents on his desktop. Why not. Idgaf. 
 So I opened explorer and \CompName\c$ and boom she was in. No pw authentication prompt. I checked AD and she&#x27;s a freaking domain admin. 
 I was warned she had control issues, but that&#x27;s just bonkers. To put the entire company&#x27;s security at risk just for power that you don&#x27;t know how to wield is a sign of some deep issues. Any anxiety I had is out the window. It&#x27;s like seeing someone naked.

                              <span>Just as title says. We were just notified that the company is removing the cellphone reimbursement for everyone across the board, and the expectation is that we will still use our cell phones at personal expense. Any suggestions how I deal with this? We are in California and the law seems clear on this. I&#x27;ve reached out to a law firm to discuss.

                              <span>Covered previously here. 
 In 2020 the VP of Engineering left and tried to elevate me to the lead Tech Lead on top of the other Tech Leads sitting on top of Engineering. Since he was leaving, though, as well as the IT Director, I feared they would put me in charge of all of IT if I accepted, so I suggested a peer structure for the tech leads, which is what we went with.
 Fast forward a year and the interim IT Director leaves and they don’t replace him. Fast forward another year and they ask me to be the Director of IT as discussed in that previous post. I assessed what was needed, recommended they hire a director of IT with experience in IT management and tried to move on.
 A couple of months later they asked me to take over some temporary IT responsibilities while the main IT person was on vacation. A few months later they ask me to manage him. 🤦‍♂️ I again reiterated that they should hire an IT Director and that I would prefer to stay in software development, managing engineers.
 A couple of months later they laid me off as some in the previous thread predicted.
 I suppose the lesson in there could be to just do whatever job they ask you to do and suck it up, but the lesson to me is that I had it sniffed out for 3 years earlier where this was all headed. They wanted a Director of IT on the cheap and without listening to the recommendations of their own staff.
 It&#x27;s still burning me up when I think about it. I was functionally doing the job before being laid off. I just didn&#x27;t agree to it being permanent.

                              <span>So I love my wireless headphones… to the point I routinely sing the entire time I’m down here… I forgot recently that our data center has video surveillance and didn’t realize we have audio as well…
 Anyone ever wonder if they sound as bad as they think they do when singing at the top of their lungs in a room of white noise hoping to never be heard… yet forget in our day in age we have audio/video recordings potentially anywhere?
 I just hope the team gets a laugh and an enjoyable serenade 😂 at least I’m working on my karaoke 🎤 🎶 skills 😆 😝

                              <span>Due to life and reasons, at 59, I&#x27;m trying to find an IT job after a long time away.
 Twenty years ago I worked in IT; my last job was VB programming and AS/400 MS-SQL integration. Since then I&#x27;ve been a stay-at-home dad, with a homelab. I&#x27;ve also developed some electronics skills and been interested in microcontrollers, etc. I&#x27;ve been into Linux since the 90s. I know I have the skills necessary to be a competent asset to an IT department.
 I&#x27;ve been applying online, and about half the time I&#x27;m told my application&#x27;s been viewed more than once, but I&#x27;ve yet to receive any responses beyond that. I&#x27;m usually only applying to system or network admin jobs, seeing as the engineering jobs usually want college; I have no degree.
 Should I be trying to find a really small, 1-2, person IT department and give up on the bigger corporate places? I live in metro Detroit. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Just wondering if y&#x27;all have ever experienced this or have any courses of action to take. 
 My Org has a Microsoft Surface that we keep off of our domain - it goes to trade shows and contains no protected information. However, we pulled it out this year and the password to get into it did not work. Our sales team has locked themselves out of it entirely. There is nothing of major importance on there, but they do want to get into it to pull the stuff that is. 
 It is locked out, and I don&#x27;t have the option to switch the user to login to the local admin. It is not on our domain, so I can&#x27;t go through that. I may be explaining this poorly. 
 Is it hopeless to try to get back into it?

                              <span>It&#x27;s deeply saddening to see all of our favorite products being shifted to a subscription or pay-as-you-go model. Vendors getting greedy with licensing. Nickel and diming customers to death. 
 - Microsoft Office
 - Anti-Virus
 - Servers (cloud, etc)
 - Networking (Meraki and others)
 - Veeam (licensed per-vm now instead of socket-based)
 ​
 are there any vendors left that allow you to buy perpetual licensing? I understand the reasoning for them - continued stream of ongoing revenue. I miss the days where you could buy a product and use it until EOL without yearly subscription fees, aside from maybe warranty/support.
 ​
 What is the future for IT? Subscription workstation hardware? I guess that&#x27;s technically VDI. Good grief.

 Anyone have experience with this recently that could recommend a budget android tablet that could be placed in a mount? Trying to keep cost down.

 ​
 My organization recently ordered two Dell PowerEdge servers, each with dual CPUs (8c/16t per CPU), and set up a vSphere environment with vCenter. I have made a template for Windows Server 2022 Datacenter and had questions regarding the WS licenses we received. The licenses are &quot;Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (16 CORE)&quot; and we received two product keys per each of the servers. Is there anything I should know if I were to assign these product keys to VMs? I read that the WS22 DC licenses are unlimited use per host compared to the Standard edition. If they are unlimited use, can I use the same product key on each of the servers running VMs? We are attempting to do failover on the servers as well, which is currently set up; we just need VMs now. Also, am I able to add the product key to the template I made and every future VM from that template will be licensed as well?
 ​
 Any insight is appreciated.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been trying to stand up a new domain controller. Cloned a VM of an existing one and started updating it. However I&#x27;ve hit a massive roadblock. Since this is for a different geographic location I figured we should update our list of time servers to include something for the west site so when the east site becomes a smouldering crater everything can still keep running. Redundancy and all that. 
 Our existing domain controllers have 4 time servers already, but they&#x27;re all in the east. So I hop into a Powershell session on the new DC and hammer out the following:
 w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:&quot;server1.domain.com,0x8 server2.domain.com,0x8 server3.domain.com,0x8 server4.domain.com,0x8 server5.domain.com,0x8&quot; /syncfromflags:manual /update 
 I get the message that the command ran successfully. All good right? I go to verify with:
 w32tm /query /peers 
 Bad news. Nothing has changed. It&#x27;s still the same four time servers that were originally there. 
 I&#x27;ve spent the better part of a week researching and attempting all permutations of the command I can think of to induce literally any change to the list and nothing. I&#x27;m throwing in the towel on this one. I need help.

                              <span>We have been experiencing some brute force login attacks against some of our sites over the past 12 hours or so. Upon further digging all of the IPs are in Sprint ranges. Upon digging further with NMap they all have 3128/tcp open squid-http. I then did a more detailed scan and came back with:
 3128/tcp open squid-http? | fingerprint-strings: | GetRequest, HTTPOptions: | HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently | Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 12:46:31 GMT | Content-Type: text/html;charset&#x3D;utf-8 | Content-Length: 0 | Location: https://www.tplinkcloud.com/
 Which made me think of recent articles:
 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-infect-tp-link-router-firmware-to-attack-eu-entities/ https://duo.com/decipher/mirai-botnet-attackers-exploit-tp-link-bug
 We are going to report this to sprint as well but is it possible we uncovered a much bigger thing here? Are sprint customer routers being compromised and no one is aware?

                              <span>In summary, we have a large organization with more than 400 clinics connected through a s2s VPN. My current project involves identifying all the X-ray machines in our clinics along with their respective models. We have a variety of brands such as ICAT, Planmeca, Vatech, Sirona, Dexis, and more. The success of this project is crucial as any inaccuracies could jeopardize my job. I aim to automate the process, but due to the diverse range of X-ray machine brands in our environment, finding a universal solution is challenging. The operating systems of the devices lack consistency and sufficient detail for a simple network scan. Additionally, not all models provide this information in the registry. The best approach I can think of is to rely on human input, albeit with the potential for human error. I plan to email each clinic manager, requesting the model and serial number of the X-ray machine, or even a picture of it, to ensure comprehensive accuracy.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have been asked to get &quot;encryption&quot; set up on emails for users that are sending sensitive information externally and internally. 
 What I have done so far is create a rule inside of exchange that states if the subject has &quot;Encrypt&quot; in it, then apply m365 Message encryption and rights protect message with &quot;Encrypt&quot;. This works great when sending to an external email, it forces the recipient to authenticate to view, and allows them to download and view an excel or docx file attached. 
 The issues is internally, if I send a encrypted email to anyone within my domain, they can view the message but not the attachment, it tells them to request permission and that does nothing? I have tried to go into properties of the file and add the domain user but am unable to. I keep reading about IRM settings, but have so far been unable to locate where I can edit those. 
 If there is a better way to go about this whole process, please let me know. 
 Thank you for any guidance you can provide.

                              <span>Recently I started replacing monitors for some users and have had pushback from managers on why I am replacing something that works. They have no issue when we install a new computer, laptop, or keyboard/mouse and those have a shorter replacement schedule. But monitors have been getting pushback. Screens do fade over time, and the newer hardware is generally lighter, thinner, and better connected options. 
 Our schedule is Desktops/Laptops - 4 years, Monitors - 6 years, Network - 6 years, Copiers/Printers - 6 years. All of this is subject to change based on needs or growth, but this is the guide we follow. We have some gear that is a lot older and not been replaced such as monitors that are 8 years old and some printers that are the same age. 
 Curious if I am way off on this or what others have as a replacement schedule?

 What benefit does this have over simply adding the SharePoint folder as a shortcut to their OneDrive?
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I would like to ask for maybe stupid question, but I didn&#x27;t find any answer yet.
 I&#x27;m new as a sysadmin and we&#x27;re currently changing our ISP. My coworker told me that we need a pool of 4 public IP address for each office we&#x27;ve.
 I asked the reason and he told that we&#x27;ve to split it for security like:
 - Public IP Address for VPN
 - Public IP Address for posting content(webpages, ftp, etc.)
 - Public IP Address for Internet surfing
 Well. As I said, I tried to search for that but I din&#x27;t found any answer. So do you think guys this is a tipically practice in business ? Or it&#x27;s a foolishness ? 
 If that&#x27;s true, how can I get info about that for document myself ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>We are running a windows NUC based conference system in our church using Logi group and Logitech touchscreen that mirrors the display. I want a simple app to put two buttons on the screen - one for Zoom and one for Teams. I found Displaynote&#x27;s Launcher but at $500 it is too much for us. I imagine there has to be a much simpler free alternative? Any ideas? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 We just found around 30% of our computers does not get language pack install.
 Any idea what would be explaining language pack missing? There are no language pack install on fault computers.
 The issue seems to be random.
 Thanks,

                              <span>I&#x27;m being asked to increase the security of a company, small/medium size (100s of clients), very high value/volume of money (many billions per year).
 obviously the network is already segmented, one aspect we are considering is client protection and isolation, I was thinking it would be nice to prevent potential lateral movements between clients, so blocking everything between clients and allowing only traffic to/from allowed servers, they even have a nomachine based browser solution for employee to go on the web on personal/non work sites, so I can really come up with a specific list of allowed traffic.
 I&#x27;m a linux guy by trade, so I don&#x27;t know much about windows/AD, has anyone done this?
 when I looked at the default windows firewall rules there&#x27;s a bunch of useless stuff there (at least in this context), I was planning to nuke the default profile and make one from scratch, what should I do for AD? is this it?
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd772723(v&#x3D;ws.10))
 any unforeseen consequences I should be aware of? any pointers you guys have?

                              <span>Hey all. I’m stumped and hoping you can help. 
 Our client suddenly stopped receiving mail yesterday around noon. 
 I checked Admin.Microsoft&gt;domains and found this message &quot;The name server (NS) or Start of Authority (SOA) records for your domain aren&#x27;t set up correctly. Check the NS records and the primary name server specified in the SOA record to make sure they are valid, internet-facing, name servers hosting your domain&#x27;s records.&quot;
 I also ran MX and NS lookups on whatsmydns.net. Both returned with near zero propagation. (NS is showing resolution in Mexico City, Russia, and Pakistan but nowhere else)
 DNS records are entered correctly in our registrar (domain.com) and have not been recently changed. I chatted with their support and they kept saying “wait 24 hours” and “everything looks good on our end”.
 At this point we’re ready to just switch registrars to stop the bleeding, but I would love any other ideas if y’all have them. 
 TIA

                              <span>Operation wise or update wise - in general I think everything works quite well. 
 I don&#x27;t have issues like 10 or 15 years ago where quickest solution was to reinstall system and any software that was there or restore image. 
 Hardware seems also much more reliable. Even printers... 
 Well should not be surprise because a lot of people are working to do so. 
 Wondering if it is just me being lucky with environment I work in, me being just much more experienced to properly setup stuff or don&#x27;t touch things I should not, but maybe it is just N&#x3D;1 and everyone else has different opinion?

                              <span>UK based, currently have ~3 years exp as a solo sys admin for an entirely cloud based (azure + m365) fintech adjacent startup. I quit last November for a &#x27;sabbatical&#x27;. My plan was to get the az-104 cert, both as extra evidence I know what I&#x27;m doing and so I can fill in knowledge gaps, plus it gave some justification for the sabbatical in interviews.
 Unfortunately I need a new job sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve been studying, but after taking a practice exam... It isn&#x27;t looking great. Based on my last job I&#x27;m confident in my abilities in practice, but the practice exam seemed very based on memorising minutiae instead. While the exam wasn&#x27;t great, tons of grammar and spelling errors making it hard to parse, I do believe the types of questions are representative.
 I can continue to study but I&#x27;ll end up going over budget, or I can pause this, start interviewing now without the cert, and hope for the best.
 Do you think there will be a significant difference between my offers with 3 years azure etc experience + 6 months break vs the same but with az-104 picked up in that time? Would mentioning my cert goal and studying help? I have very little interview experience :(
 Tldr: difference in ability to land a good job with or without az-104 after 3 years cloud sysadmin exp, and a break?

                              <span>I have a friend that&#x27;s making a fairly radical career change and will be starting as an entry level IT support/sysadmin with a smallish company (very modest footprint - Windows laptops, half a dozen servers, SIP phone system, a bunch of printers and some very conventional networking). 
 He will be supported by me (~25 years in IT, experienced Windows/Linux/etc engineer), but my background is pretty much all self-taught/on the job. His new employers are happy to put him through a moderate amount of training to get him up to speed and support his growth, but I have no idea what certifications currently offer the most value at this level. MCSE? Comptia? 
 Any suggestions people can offer (and any supporting info they can provide) would be very welcome.
 Thanks...

                              <span>In the days where everyone was in the office we used an on-prem web proxy from Sophos which gave us really good reporting on websites visited and ability to block categories etc. We have moved away from Sophos for our AV now and with hybrid working it wouldn&#x27;t have worked anyway so I&#x27;m interested in what people use to monitor, report on and block web sites. For a bit of background our endpoints are intune managed but most of our apps come from citrix servers which are on prem. We have a sonicwall firewall but its not doing any https inspection and would only cover people in the office anyway.

                              <span>Hi, Junior Systems Admin here
 Can i get something like a weekly report from Windows server to my email, on a dashboard or pdf document etc which shows information such as
 -how many new accounts were created in a time period and details of the accounts
 -summary of user account lock outs, password resets etc
 -summary of user account that were disabled, deleted etc
 -summary of server restarts, shutdowns etc
 -Summary of DC logins with IP addresses, user etc
 -summary of remaining free DHCP IP addresses
 -etc
 More like something that will give some information on the health of the server, activity or i can quickly glance to see anomarlies which can later be drilled into

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I&#x27;am a sole Sysadmin in our company with about 250+ users based in Europe. I started around about 1 Year ago there and cleaned up a lot from IT Assets, Processes and Policies short I got some structure in IT there before I was there there were almost nothing just chaos. We are a fully SaaS Company and in general I manage all SaaS tools (Google Workspace, Slack, WorkspaceONE and couple more tools we dont have an Provider like OneLogin but at the end I try to Automate everything to make it a bit easier for me) for our Hardware we are currently 50/50 one half is managed by us the other is managed by our Hardware provider but ofc. I also manage them. Little sub note: all devices that comes from our Hardware Provider are MDM managed all others are getting added by myself step by step you know its pain sometimes to get first all the Users Device Informations (Have to ask them). Since couple months it can get really busy almost max. of my cap thats why I wrote some more policies and telling the users to always using the IT Helpdesk if they have any Questions. Now I had a meeting were they ask me to write down my tasks I did last week and asked my about IT Outsourcing to Support me e.g as Backup when being Sick or on Vacation. I told them yes we can check out but I am not sure if this would be the solution In my opinion we should get another sysadmin there) I &#x27;am also a bit scared about if maybe I get replaced after they Implement the IT Outsourcing since I worked a lot in the company and did a lot changes I would be really sad If something like that would happens.
 ​
 Somehow I feel since the Meeting not quite well, I always think about it. Do you have any tips? atm. I&#x27;am on vacation for 4 Days without any Backup.
 ​
 Best regards,
 kpwde

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m setting up new WiFi network for the office using Meraki APs and want to use AD authentication. I&#x27;ve set up the NPS server (WS2019) as explained in the documentation, but I have problems with windows 10 clients. 
 I think the configuration is correct since I tried with with other devices and are connecting without problems. With W11 I can connect using computer and user account, and with iOS and Android with ad user with no problems.
 I already re-checked NPS policies, check that 802.11r is disabled on APs. W10 clients are on 22H2 so sholud be ok, right? And as I said basically all the other devices are working... 
 In the logs the only I see is error 16 - Authentication failed due to user credentials mismatch, but credentials are right.
 Did anyone face this situation? Thanks.

I&#x27;m just wondering if there is any way for me to find any machines that I&#x27;ve missed that are still authenticating through it. Google seems to just give information about the current machine you are on, and which DC that machine auth&#x27;d through.
 ​
 Any advice appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 I hope I explain well. english is not main language and that&#x27;s also what makes my internet searches more difficult.
 I am at my wits end here with a legacy software that we want to use through RDP on some older Datalogic Skorpio (x3 and x4) 
 The problem is when creating new users:
 the user is added to several groups, most importantly group that autoexec c:\myapp\launcher.exe
 (through the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot;)
 our launcher then allows to start other apps they need, one of them doesn&#x27;t work right away tho
 it&#x27;s an old 3rd party (obsolete, but will require a couple years to phase out) that requires some cache temporary folders in c:\users\user\appdata
 this folder doesn&#x27;t exist when creating a new user and with the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot; apparently is not created properly
 THE WORKAROUND: the workaround is to remove the user from the &quot;autoexec&quot; for aa few minutes, log in manually to that user so windows creates those folders upon first login, then add the user back to the &quot;autoexec&quot; GPO and now everything works
 ​
 so, when logging in manual once, %appdata% cache folders are created properly (with proper persmissions) but when the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot; is enabled from the very beginning, it doesn&#x27;t work
 we don&#x27;t have remote folders or any of that.
 is there a way to solve this so we don&#x27;t have to log into the user manually without autoexec every time we make a new user?

                              <span>Hello,
 We are experiencing issues with a bunch of machines reverting their Version of Win10. It could be something else but as far as we found out, if one of our AD-Admins logs in to a computer where a normal User was logged in, the Win10 Version get&#x27;s downgraded to Win10 Pro from Enterprise. Not a big deal at the moment but in our reports we&#x27;re having like 100 Pro Versions now where there should be a solid 6k Enterprise. Funny thing is, when the User logs back in to his PC it takes ages to get it back to Enterprise by himself or the Azure Sync.
 Our Users have an MS E3 license. Admins don&#x27;t have a license as of now. 
 We already had a MS Ticket open and they provided us with the solution to just run a PS-script but we are still searching for the root cause to eliminate that. 
 If we run slmgr /dlv we can see in the script host window that it&#x27;s Win10 Pro and licensed but on the Win10 settings pane it says Win10 Enterprise, which is also strange.
 Anyone else having such issues? Or similar things? Have to be honest that the AD-Admin Accounts are just our first guess.
 Thanks

 I&#x27;ve been a Sysadmin and a CISO before in both small and large orgs, but with decisions from others able to work their way in that were let&#x27;s say, less than long term scalable.

 The domain is registered and it&#x27;s time to build around it. I was thinking:

                              <span>Hi there
 maybe you can assist me :)
 i have 1 Remote Desktop Server (Win 2022) and 10 Users. There is only 1 Workstation.
 the single Workstation will be used hourly bi other people. so my plan/wish is:
 ​
  
User 1 goes to workstation, put in his smart card (as example an yubikey)
 Remote Desktop will automatically start and require the PIN from the User 1
 Session Start....
 If the User unplug the SmartCard, RDP Session close (user still logged in)
 User 2 goes to workstation...
 ...
  
i was able to set up this scenario for the most part with yubico:
 https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013707820-YubiKey-Smart-Card-Deployment-Guide
 but this is not 100% user (and admin) friendly, i&#x27;m not able to autostart rdp on plugin yubikey, sometimes i have to change from user/pw to smartcard manually. on unplug yubikey an error message (from mstsc.exe) appears...
 is there an company / tool who can handle this scenario? do you know an &quot;all in one&quot; solution for this? i believe there must be many company&#x27;s (hospitals, retirement home&#x27;s etc.) which work similarly to this...
 thanks a lot :)
 edit:
 - all on prem, azure ad is available...

 They are finding that a very small percentage of URLs look legit but redirect to NSFW sites. The datasets are large so the URLs can&#x27;t all be manually checked. Is there a service that can access a potentially large list of URLs, check where they are redirected to, and flag if the site redirected to is NSFW or hosts malware?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, I am looking to set up a SOHO network supporting 10GoE, which will have around 6 workstations, two NASs with dual bonded nics, printers, a WAP, and a few other network connected devices. There are times of heavy data transfers of 1TB or more and regular transfers of ~50GB+.
 I’m thinking a minimum 24-port switch, which will allow for future expansion. I’m looking for suggestions on a switch, that will probably need to be managed for possible future VLAN setup. Please let me know what you’d implement and what you’d avoid. While I will likely have the support of the IT department, this will likely be managed locally by me, with some networking (and learning more rapidly) knowledge. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a client with 8 older Netgear switches (GS728TTP/GS748T/GS752TP) that I would like to replace over the next 12-18 months as the devices near EOL. Thinking of moving them to Aruba switches and wondering if I can mix in the Arubas with the existing Netgear as I make the transition. What might be the most significant issues that would likely present themselves in such an environment? Or will these switches play nicely together while I swap them out over the coming months?

 I&#x27;m trying to ping hosts on directly connected network but can&#x27;t see reply. I can see correct arp entry on the ASA. ICMP inspection is enabled in global policy. Access lists is any any on both inside outside interface. Strange. 
 Any idea what&#x27;s going on?

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently took over a new network and we have been asked to reduce cost across the board including our SDWAN. Currently we use an MSP with Velocloud devices. We pay ~$1000/month on average per branch for the Velocloud managed-service. Most of our branches are very small ~5 users, leveraging Velocloud Edge510. We have ~20 sites.
 I have a couple of questions:
  
Can Velocloud devices be customer-managed? (wondering if we can save by removing managed services)
 Does anyone have good experience with any other lower cost &quot;branch router&quot; options that have simplified/central management? It doesn&#x27;t have to be SDWAN necessarily but if it is SDWAN, we are looking for an SDWAN that can be customer-managed so that the cost is lower.
  
Thanks.
 Edit:
  
Just found the $1000/month average was skewed by mid/large sites. My apologies for the confusion!
 The correct average cost for small sites with Velocloud Edge510 (with 30Mbps throughput) is around ~$200/month per site, this includes hardware device(s), license and managed-service (it&#x27;s a bit lower for sites with a single VCE router and higher for sites with dual VCE routers).
 Based on the comments this appears to be a more reasonable cost for the small sites though it&#x27;s still good to see what others are using or recommending for lower cost alternatives. Appreciate it!
  
Thanks again!

                              <span>Ok I have taken a picture and uploaded it here for my question:
 https://ibb.co/P1dK5Zp
 On the remote logging target page of the ISE server, WHY oh WHY is the only option you can choose for the SSL certificate the ISE will present to the remote syslog server, a &quot;CA&quot; certificate. The ISE is not used as a CA, it&#x27;s a client/endpoint with its own system certificate, only. It is just a node with its own publically signed SSL cert. Yet, you can litreally only choose a certificate from the trusted source certificate page, which is a page dedicated for Root/Intermediary CA certificates. So the config doesnt make sense. It&#x27;s like the ISE is saying to the syslog server, Hi syslog server I am some upchain CA server, we good?
 If you read the Cisco ISE documentation in the link below, under the section heading &quot;Configure Secure Syslog Remote Logging Target&quot;, it states, step 12:
 &quot;Choose the CA certificate that Cisco ISE must present to the secure syslog server from the Select CA Certificate drop-down list.&quot;
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_basic_setup.html
 So you are forced to present a CA certificate, even though we don&#x27;t use the ISE as a CA server. So how are you supposed to use a a regular system certificate to present itself to the syslog server?

By high level I mean (eg. if we talk about WLAN, we segment the business based on enterprise access points which are further segmented to indoor and outdoor and then by generation) I want to understand the use case and the terminology used in SD-WAN, Campus Switches, Data Center Switches, SASE. 
 Any advice on how to start would really help me (a lot)

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been troubleshooting a call center getting &quot;ICE Collection timeout&quot; messages from AWS. They are using AWS connect. So far it&#x27;s just this one site that has been having these issues and I&#x27;ve been troubleshooting this for about 3 months now along with various network seniors in the company. We&#x27;ve been on calls with AWS and everyone else which brings me now to the minds here at reddit.
 This particular site hasn&#x27;t been upgraded to Cisco SDWAN yet and is currently running GETVPN. At the beginning of this month we had our ISP (AT&amp;T) Upgrade the links from 100mbps to 250mbps links with no change in ICE errors.
 People who work from home don&#x27;t see the errors but the vpns they have on the laptops use the split tunneling.
 Yesterday I chatted with the ISP (AT&amp;T) and got reports from them about their links as well as did various tests from our datacenter to the site and everything came back clean. I cleared the counters yesterday at the site as well as rebooted the entire network about a month ago. We really haven&#x27;t seen anything to indicate a network issue besides call center reporting ICE errors. 
 From the AWS side they&#x27;ve pretty much pointed back at our network.
 So, what are your alls thoughts or questions I could look into to help?
 Thanks.

                              <span>What is everyone using for DNS HA Load Balancer?
 I would like to have 2 front-end public dns ha load balancers distributing requests to 4 back-end public dns servers.
 If read that HAProxy can do HA Load Balancing but that’s only for TCP applications. Since DNS mainly runs on UDP is there something similar for it? 
 I’ve tried Nginx proxy setup for UDP and it would work for about 100-200 requests but for public resolutions of 2-5k it can’t handle the load as it doesn’t respond fast enough.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a setup where I&#x27;m trying to achieve the following:
  
Juniper MX204 with JunOS 21.4R3 (AS65001) as EVPN gateways
 Mellanox SN2700 with Cumulus Linux 5.4 as spine (AS65100)
 Proxmox node with Frr 8.5.1 as hypervisor
  
All works fine, the Juniper, Cumulus and Proxmox nodes can ping eachother IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses just fine.
 The problem is that the EVPN MACs aren&#x27;t installed in the MAC databases of the Frr and JunOS routers.
 JunOS  JunOS works, but Frr  JunOS doesn&#x27;t,

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading through technical documents provided by a wholesale broadband provider and would appreciate assistance with understanding how this works.
 The wholesale broadband provider operates an LAC. I&#x27;m trying to understand how you would configure LNS, eBGP etc. Assuming I have only 1 tunnel end point:
  
 Domain Name Tunnel End Point Addresses (/32) 
  
 broadband.example.com 1.1.1.241/32 
 
 And here is my eBGP info:
  
 eBGP Peers (2 Per Resilient Link) 1.1.1.240/30 
  
  1.1.1.244/30 
 
 And address range to eBGP peer mappings:
  
 Address Range (LNS) Corresponding eBGP Peer 
  
 1.1.1.0/24 1.1.1.240/30 
 
 My Questions:
  
Can my tunnel end point address be the same as my eBGP peering address?
 Can my LNS be within the BGP peering range?
  
I may be completely misunderstanding this so if someone could provide a sort of summary of what all this means I&#x27;d be grateful. Thanks!

                              <span>Just checking my thought process here I have a business ISP router that&#x27;s got a 4G Failover that links to that router only. I do not want double NAT though and want the firewall to handle all this.
 So is it ok in this scenario to put the ISP router in DMZ mode to the firewall? In a way it just then acts like it&#x27;s not there and as if it&#x27;s just a WAN?
 Is my thought process correct?

                              <span>Probably very basic for y&#x27;all, but I need your inputs if there is a better way to do this.
 As the title said, we have 2 separate networks.
 Each have their own firewall/router.
 Each network have their own ISP.
 How to use the ISP of the other network as backup internet in case main internet goes down?
 (Sometimes will use the backup internet while main internet is still active, but not all the time) 
 Kindly refer to the images below.
 This is basically my question:
 The_Problem 
 This is my initial Plan:
 Is_this_a_Stupid_Idea? 
 I can&#x27;t wrap my head around this.
 ISP Modems using PPPoE so I can&#x27;t directly connect the other Network&#x27;s firewall to it.
 So I guess I have to put something in between the ISP Modem and the firewalls, to do the NAT.
 But it feels like it just adds to latency and more devices, plus more point of failures.
 I feel like there is a better way. 
 Hope somebody can suggest. Don&#x27;t flame me. :D

                              <span>A few team members regularly take notes in notepad as .txt files. These are often scratch notes that never get turned into process documentation even though they should. 
 Others use a bland looking Word document template. 
 We have a file share and a SharePoint Wiki that just acts as a second repository for our documents. Seriously, we dump .docxs and .pdfs into both places and hope someone will see them. 
 Not everything feels like it should be in a Word document. If I&#x27;m ever writing some CLI syntax, word just feels wrong. If I&#x27;m writing configurations out as part of a process of provisioning template, word feels wrong. I like Markdown a lot, but I don&#x27;t have a good way to share these files or make them collaborative. They also don&#x27;t have a lot of theming or &quot;pretty&quot; features to them, which can be seen as a upside and downside. 
 How can I, without becoming our &quot;documentation person&quot;, improve how my team documents things? Right now, people either document things poorly, or not at all because we just don&#x27;t have any good methods of documenting things. Nobody has ever seemingly taken the time to improve how we document.

                              <span>Hi. I would like to understand what the pure theoretical way to use different bands would work. 
 If I have a single large room, and at each end is an AP. I have users with PC/laptop/phone that want maximum speed (Wireless AC/AX). I have smart devices in the area, that just need a tiny message to start and stop (Wireless N). 
 In regards to best radio interference, theory. What would be the best config? 
 Can I set the N to 20Ghz. Then tell the AC/AX to use only the 40/50Ghz range, not 20? 
 Would that be the pro way to set up a simple system? Thanks for any tips. Cheers.

                              <span>My company is looking to implement RPKI. I&#x27;ve read some of the RFCs as well as plenty of blog posts. We are a very small team and do not have time to implement route origin validation using available OSS. I&#x27;m looking for a vendor to manage the implementation for us.
 Does anyone have recommendations?
 I found just one so far, has anyone worked with this company - Defensor Cloud? Looks like a startup and doesn&#x27;t even have an updated website.

                              <span>I have a spine leaf vxlan environment (Cisco 9k using nxos) using evpn for the control plane. On my border leafs I have an aggregate network in BGP to advertise network summary to edge firewalls, but want to block that summary from advertising to downstream leafs (downstream leafs have two /25 networks, I agg them to one /24 and advertise to FW). I’ve created an export route map on the vrf context on border leafs matching the aggregate prefix to block, but it is still being advertised. I am able to block the prefix on import maps at downstream leafs but want to block at source. Can I get another pair of eyes on my config? I am still fairly new to evpn so I may be missing something simple or fundamentally misunderstanding how this works.

                              <span>I want to set up a redundant infrastructure with two RADIUS and Fileservers and wanted to use Kemp Load Balancer free, though the throughput is only 20mbit.
 My question: The load balancer, as I understand, only handles the initial connection/handshake, correct? So 20 mbit should be sufficient I guess? 
 If not, I would switch to the integrated Windows Server Load Balancer.

 Appreciate any suggestions!

                              <span>We have a two Linux devices on VMware ESXi hosts, if I ping from the console of either to a internal device (Server, PC, Printer or gateway) I get the normal Ping response.
 If I ping externally to 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 /Google.com /bbc.com, second ping is a DUP!, I have done a packet capture on the LAN interface of the firewall.
 No. Time Source Destination Protocol Length Info
 1 0.000000 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;63 (no response found!)
 2 0.000060 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;63 (reply in 3)
 3 0.003472 8.8.8.8 172.16.4.5 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) reply id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;117 (request in 2)

 Then the process repeats, I&#x27;m note sure I&#x27;m reading this right but it looks to me that the fist ping does not respond in time so it sends a second then the first one responds then followed by the second and that is seen as a DUP!.
 I have built a clean raw install of Ubuntu 22.04 (i think) on a different ESXi host and date store, but it does the same after first login and is still doing it after the system is upgraded.
 There are no duplicate MAC addresses on the VMWare.
 There are no Duplicate IPs in use
 My next step is to install Ubuntu to a laptop and hardwire it to the network on the same VLAN.
 Can anyone make any other suggestions that would help diagnose this issue.
 Thanks Simon

                              <span>Hello guys!
 I have had multiple attempts on establishing a L2L IPsec tunnel using certs that I installed on both ASA firewalls using NDES SCEP from a Windows Server 2019 AD CS VM. The certs are RSA 2048 based with SHA 512 signature. I tried both IKEv1 and IKEv2, the tunnels work perfectly if I switch to PSK, but when I use certs, for example with IKEv2, it gets stuck in IKE_AUTH step. FW1 sends the fragmented cert to FW2 and FW2 sends a response and then after a few seconds they start negotiating again.
 If you guys need wireshark captures or configurations, let me know. I also tried both policy based and route based tunneling using VTI, same result.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I have a 5 floor building with mostly Meraki MR36 and few MR70 deployed and I am constantly getting complaints about users connection randomly dropping. Looking at the dashboard it really doesn&#x27;t give me a lot of information to work with and it is very difficult to run a packet capture because it happens so randomly. Is there a better way to approach this issue or a proper technique to troubleshoot this. I am planning to setup a Linux DHCP server, I am thinking it might be related to Windows environment. If that doesn&#x27;t work I am planning to setup DHCP services within our core switch since all of our Meraki switches are just L2. Feel free to share any suggestions or tips how I can go about troubleshooting this.

                              <span>I work at a university and we have an newer outdoor athletics facility that has fiber ran to each corner of the facility. The boxes are built into the ground so that they&#x27;re inconspicuous. The issue is that each winter they fill up with water, it ruins the GFI switches to the power inside and the fiber that comes into a second smaller box located inside still gets filled with water and gets dirty. They were barely able to host the event this year due to this issue but it&#x27;s been a recurring problem for the 3 years the facility has been built. 
 So my understanding of the setup is: fiber from a pressbox to a subterranean enclosure, fiber goes into that box into a smaller grey box that does something I don&#x27;t understand, we then bring a switch that we keep inside a pelican case over and plug the fiber from the small grey box inside the subterranean enclosure into the switch, then all the necessary devices plug into the switch using ethernet. The water is getting into the small grey box and breaking things each winter.
 I don&#x27;t know enough about networking to hold an eduacated converstation on the topic with you all but I just got out of a meeting with some people that presented me with a solution to this issue that I didn&#x27;t like. They admitted they don&#x27;t know how other places do it so we&#x27;re all kinda hunting for solutions to this issue. They want something above ground but since it&#x27;s an athletics facility that would require a box right on the edge of a playing field which presents competitive, asthetic and safety concerns. 
 Is there a box or setup of some kind that can be left in an underground enclosure that would be able to stay dry for a number of years? I asked if there wasn&#x27;t a way to cap the fiber cable coming into the subterranean enclosure with a cap that was waterproof then just bring the boxes and switches for the events each time but they said there&#x27;s no cap that would keep it clean enough. 
 Any thoughts or solutions would be appreciated!

                              <span>I have a Cisco stack 3650 I am adding a new vlan to. This switch stack currently has multiple vlans already talking to each other just fine (10.1.2.x , 10.1.5.x) and I am trying to add a 10.1.7.x subnet with a new vlan into the switch. So far devices on the new vlan I created on 10.1.7.x are able to ping the switch and the vlan gateway, but they cannot reach any other part of the network or outside wan. I am unsure what else I need to do to make it so this new vlan is able to communicate with the rest of the network, attached is the configuration https://imgur.com/a/myL4Uxz/

                              <span>I have a Metro E circuit where the provider is blocking certain protocols so I lashed up a VxLAN configuration to get around the blocking. Essentially I built a L2 circuit over a L2 pseudowire that is built incorrectly on the carrier side. 
 I&#x27;m very familiar with SP L2 MPLS but this is my first foray into VxLAN. The need is simple at the moment and I&#x27;m curious if I can decouple EVPN. 
 I used the following guide/chapter to get the VxLAN circuit built:

 Current WiFi originally designed for visitor access, new design needs full floor production coverage. I have all the Meraki APs needed but it would be nice to visually map based on model. I could do this with Ubiquiti’s heatmap tool and try to reference an AP like the MR 53. 
 Any software or tools that will accept a floor plan to map? 
 Thank you for any info.

                              <span>We have a Ramtel R733 analog emergency phone we are trying to connect using a D-Link DWR-920V which is a cellular home &amp; business phone provided by US Cellular. The issue is that the R733 wants ~10vdc off-hook and the D-Link device only provides 8vdc(tested with multimeter). According to some research the R733 is pretty sensitive about voltage so it has to be pretty close to 10v for it to work.
 Is there any sort of solution that would provide the 10vdc off-hook that it needs without replacing either the emergency phone or the cellular device? We need to stick with US Cellular because we don&#x27;t want to open an account with another provider. If we did need to replace the emergency phone, are there options that would work with 8vdc? We have power in the location it is going so something that requires additional power is possible as well.

                              <span>I apologize if this is not the place to put this question but I am having a hard time finding a resource online. Basically I just want a basic template on how a dACL is writtein in ISE. We are doing a lot of port security / 802.1X and I am now deep diving into the world of dACLs. I don&#x27;t want to keep bugging my level 2 guy and would like a better understanding.
 I know there is source address and source ports etc and what keeps throwing me off is where all the &quot;any&quot; words go.
 So can you break down some of these examples?
 permit udp any any eq 123
 and
 permit tcp any range 4000 4006 any
 Any tips or info would be appreciated.

                              <span>Guys, a conceptual doubt... 
 I&#x27;m doing a lab on OSPF, BGP, VXLAN, IPv4 and IPv6 eve-ng.
 I have 2 geographically distant DCs connected via peer BGP with 2 ISPs.
 My idea is to configure VXLAN between the 2 DCs so that overlay customers can travel in their networks transparently, as if they were &quot;Regions&quot;, as it is in the public cloud.
 Speaking of IPv4, I don&#x27;t see a problem, because the customer&#x27;s network IPv4 is a non-routable IP on the internet, so I have 1 gateway in the customer&#x27;s network on each DC.
 My question is about IPv6, which is a routable IP...
 Well... basically I want to connect two IPv4 and IPv6 overlay networks of geographically separated DCs.
 I would like to talk about this issue, as many of you work with these technologies on a day-to-day basis, so I wanted to learn a little more about it.
 I couldn&#x27;t put the eve-ng topology image here, so the link is below:

                              <span>I am in a situation whereby i have mis-configured one of my miniature computers with the incorrect IP address, Gateway and DNS and this computer has since lost internet connectivity and i can no longer access it remotely to make changes to it anymore. I cannot reset it to factory default because it does not have such a function to do so. The device always dials back to a remote web site where i use it to make changes to it. 
 My question is, what can i do, to allow this miniature computer with the incorrect static IP addresses to regain internet access so that i can configure it online.
 ​
 Would connecting it to another computer with internet connection and bridge the ethernet port to the wireless ethernet enable the miniature computer to regain internet access?

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t used a Cisco Wireless controller in over a decade. New job just had a pair of 9800s installed in load balancing mode. I do not see anywhere that you can find the connected device statistics. On the dashboard, I see the top APs by data usage, but I can&#x27;t drill down. I went through all the menu items and I cannot see any individual device statistics. 
 Am I blind?
 Running Version 17.3.4c for reference
 Edit: to be clear, I was looking to sort clients by data usage. For example, one AP is in a remote location, but is in the top 3 APs by data usage. I would like to see what is using so much data on that AP.

 Looking to read about how it works, rather than why it works, if that makes sense. Something to familiarize me with the terms and concepts. TIA.

                              <span>We have a few larger projects coming up that involve quite a few unfamiliar elements. I&#x27;m working on planning the processes out, but am having a hard time organizing my information. We&#x27;re an Atlassian shop, but I find Confluence a bit too unstructured for this, and using Jira would involve a lot of effort for something that might change frequently.
 Do any of you have favorite or useful tools for this type of planning? I don&#x27;t need actual project management tools as things like dates or timelines are a bit premature at this point. I feel something like a Gantt chart without the timeline would be helpful--just tracking dependencies and breaking things into subtasks.

                              <span>Currently going down a huge rabbit hole.
 I live in a town that&#x27;s between 2 other towns. It&#x27;s a weird grey area. The town to my left has a great wide cable internet connection, and the town to the right has a vast fiber connection. However, my town has basically nothing. No cable, no fiber, only 1 WISP that is just awful. Purely LOS, unstable connection, lower than 10mbps down, 0.5 up. It&#x27;s terrible. The company has been sold twice, and still zero improvement, or care to improve.
 It&#x27;s been like this forever, there&#x27;s never been a good internet company here, and there never will be (for a long time at least).
 I have to rely on cellular internet, which isn&#x27;t even viable for the others in this town because it&#x27;s not as simple as Verizon Home Internet or T-Mobile home internet, it&#x27;s not offere…</span>

So my 2 questions are: 1. How to make sure to have the most recent installer for the different tools. Can I automate this?
  
Is an USB-Stick the best solution or is a M2 SSD for external use better in this case?

                              <span>Is the ironport esa still relevant? Lately we have been seeing some pretty blatant phishing emails get through the appliance and it appears to be missing some rather malicious files. I’m wondering if the appliance is still relevant, or if others have had similar experiences? 
 Anyone have feedback when comparing the ironports to proofpoint or other options nowadays? Thanks for any feedback /insight!!!!

I&#x27;m not interested in which OEM everyone loves but more so what is part of your decision making process when it comes to purchasing? I&#x27;ve always been of the opinion that today&#x27;s average desktop is WAAAAY overpowered for what an average worker needs that&#x27;s just running Office or editing an occasional PDF which is what most of our users do. How does your org decide things like minimum CPU, RAM, HD size, etc. ?

                              <span>I have a standard 19&quot; 42U server rack with EIA square holes.
 Some of my mounting rails with 10-32 threaded holes are meant to be screwed directly into the square holes. The rail sits flush on the rear face of the post and the screw goes directly into the threaded hole from the front, no cage nut, right through the square opening.
 They came with these 10-32 screws with a low profile flat head (the shape, not the socket) and a wide diameter head to cover up most of the square hole and provide a secure fit.
 The manufacture doesn&#x27;t sell any extras, and when I search for 10-32 server rack screws, I just get a bunch of regular ones with big domed heads. I need them to sit as flush as possible to the mounting posts.
 Is there a specific name for this style of screw, and are they readily available from common suppliers like CDW for example?
 Thanks in advance.
 ps. In general, just buying new mounting rails while it is the obvious solution, is not possible in this situation, I&#x27;m an academic researcher and I can&#x27;t really allocate funds for something that has already been done, especially when it still works. I just need some more screws.
 Edit: Thank you to u/St0nywall for figuring out I needed some 1421 mounting hardware by hammond. Life saver.

                              <span>No right answer I guess and obviously this isn&#x27;t the default setting.
 Most linux VMs or vendor &quot;appliance&quot; OVFs usually have open-vm-tools so I guess my question is aimed primarily at Windows VMs.
 What do you do and why?

                              <span>Basically what the title says. We have been remediating some vulnerabilities that were found by the cyber risk management platform our insurance company uses. 
 I provided some evidence to remove a vulnerability found and the support team warned us that any “HTTPS exposure” coming from the SonicWALL is on the radar of insurance carriers as a potentially uninsurable asset. The recommendation is to move to an alternative firewall solution such as Cisco, Cloudflare, etc. 
 Anybody have any insight on why this is?

                              <span>So I might have a domain example.com that I expect to send mail. I will configure an SPF record appropriate for this. Fine.
 But if I have a subdomain sub.example.com that does not send mail, is it best practice to explicitly configure an SPF record on this subdomain to state that it does not send mail?
 I can&#x27;t find any specification that explicitly recommends or states this. I can however find specs recommending to configure one for root domains that do not send mail

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 I want to create a culture of &quot;don&#x27;t fuck with IT&quot; at my 90 person org. We get endless emails, texts, and teams messages with &quot;my lappy doesn&#x27;t know me anymore&quot;. Or a random badge with a sticky note on my desk &quot;dude left&quot; and laptops covered in sticky shit and crumbs with a sticky note &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.
 ​
 How do I set a new precedence? I want a strict ticket template that must be filled out before defining that IT has actually been contacted.
 ​
 Does anyone have a template or an example email memo that can help me down this path?
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>As of now, Drobo is no more. 
 Even now, I still see Drobo devices still in use on occasion. I&#x27;d look at finding a replacement whenever possible, just because their BayondRAID format is not open, and if the enclosure dies, it will take sending the data to OnTrack to recover it.
 Ages ago, they were an innovative company, where RAID on the desktop was a useful thing. However, they never really made anything big after that, other than an iSCSI target, and eventually NAS models. Synology and QNAP eventually ate their lunch.
 In any case, time to decommission any Drobo storage appliances in use.
 Edited: This includes Retrospect, so if one is using Retrospect for backups, time to find a VAR and find a replacement ASAP.

                              <span>Hello people, the reason I&#x27;m asking is because I&#x27;m 21 year old and as such, really young and new to this world.
 Got in a MSP 6 months ago. We basically have to tell our hierarchy absolutely EVERYTHING we do. It makes sense your superior doesn&#x27;t want to see you watching Youtube videos when you&#x27;re supposed to be working, but here&#x27;s the thing : to clock your time in, you have to take your time spent on a ticket and do a formula to convert it. Then we use a fucking old version of Navision to report our time, it&#x27;s slow and clunky. 
 Some days we are extremely busy so we don&#x27;t have enough time to report everything we do, then next month comes, higher-ups see the numbers and say &quot;you&#x27;ve reported nothing! You didn&#x27;t work at all this month&quot; yeah of course asshole I spent more time actually working instead of trying to show you that I do work.
 ...Couldn&#x27;t they just let us live? Is it like this where you all work?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Curious to how you are managing users such as devs that need local admin to do their jobs effectively?
 Read about each dev machine having their own &quot;dev vm&quot; environment where they are full admins and other similar segregation methods.
 We are doing some Cyber security certs at the moment and I need to prove people aren&#x27;t using admin accounts with access to the internet or email and I&#x27;m struggling to fathom how to manage 30 devs when there&#x27;s only me as the primary IT resource. 
 I use Intune to manage all workstations.
 Thanks

 I have raised this concern and it hasn’t been taken seriously. I think the email signatures are being centralized on Microsoft 365 and will not be in anyone’s control except for IT.
 Is there a way to get around using something like that or what? Is it just automatically applied to every email and you can’t do anything?

                              <span>Just needed to rant a bit. I have gone through 4 account managers in two years thus far. Each of them start out so enthusiastic and very prompt but, it&#x27;s like a trend for them to fall off over time. I&#x27;m dealing with one account manager now that has not responded since May 11th with any useful information. It&#x27;s like they do not want to do any work, unless they are making a sale. The hardware lately has also been bad, maybe I just get lemons. I have been using Dell more and more, shooting for Lenovo too soon. Anyone else experience this with HP?

I work at an MSP and have come across this problem across multiple clients lately, so its not just an issue with one specific domain. While it&#x27;s a relatively easy fix to log in as a local admin and redomain the machines, the fact that this error keeps cropping up more frequently makes me wonder if there&#x27;s something Microsoft might have messed up.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a 2012R2 Server (not domain-joined) that I recently patched and it seems like that while the issue started shortly after, other 2012R2 Servers have those same patches and RDP continues to work.
 The Event ID 36888 &quot;The Windows SChannel error state is 1205&quot; is due to a TLS 1.2 handshake error and I&#x27;m wondering if you&#x27;ve every successfully resolved this and how?
 I confirmed that the Server&#x27;s self-signed\Remote Desktop SSL Certificate doesn&#x27;t expire until 9/8/2023.
 These were the patches I applied:
 April Update kb5025288
 March Update kb5023764
 February Update kb5022894
 KB5023790 
 Thank you for any help/suggestions you can offer

                              <span>I work for a car leasing company and they *insist* on having a dedicated mailbox for each major customer, and the appropriate customer support representative have access to it. Sounds good on paper but this process has gone unchecked for many years and now users have 20+ shared mailboxes each.
 This is causing outlook to constantly break (a man can only make so many new outlook profiles) as they are trying to use it as a CRM tool. 
 I have not got enough authority to implement a CRM so my question is this: What are some alternative solutions to this problem? 
 I have though about each team having a shared mailbox, with an alias for each of their respective customers. As well as caching only 6 months emails to help aleviate the strain on .psts.
 Another option would be adding members but disabling auto-mapping off, forwarding all emails into a team mailbox and the users then simply change who they are sending as.
 Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

                              <span>So 12 years of dedicating oneself to a single company has come to an end. Putting up with doing first to third line, fixing a server with a full disk to someone’s teams not integrating with outlook. 
 The last company was the straw that broke the camels back, I’m all up for doing multiple things in our line of work but expecting 3 peoples jobs from one person is too much, only hearing problems from people for years has broken me. 
 Moving onto contract work now, let’s see how different that is? I like the concept of having a set job to do and when it’s done that’s it, no expecting more or anything but also what kind of shit show will you be walking into ?

 What can I show to prove that I didn’t receive an email from the Home Office? 
 The home office denied my application for indefinite leave to remain because they claim that they had earlier sent me an email requesting for information and that I hadn’t responded. I checked my email and nothing came in from the home office either on the date they say they sent the email or any other date for that matter.

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 While testing an update from PDF24 Creator (9.x to 11.12.0) I found out that the registry paths has changed (as written in their documentation). This leads to missing printers in PDF24 Creator although they are shown as local installed printers.
 But the printers aren&#x27;t working.
 ​
 I searched the web for a solution to keep the printers after updating but found nothing at all.
 Therefore I post this solution so anyone who didn&#x27;t do that update because of this behavior can update now without reinstalling the printers.
 ​
  
open regedit.exe as admin
 search for HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Serviceshere are all PDF printers - each one got a folder (i.e. 1A2B34CDEZ)
 right click the folder and export it as .reg
 edit the exported .reg with notepad
 change the key pathfrom HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Services\1A2B34CDEZto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PDF24\Services\1A2B34CDEZ
 install the new version (auto deploy, manually, whatever) and reboot afterwards
 open regedit.exe as admin -&gt; Data -&gt; import -&gt; import .reg files
 reboot your device
 open PDF24 creator settings -&gt; printers -&gt; printers must be shown now and working properly
  
​
 It is that easy.
 ​
 Could be working for automation as well - I didn&#x27;t try it for the few devices.
 ​
 Best wishes

                              <span>Preparing to move a customer from our Hyper-V 2019 cluster to a new Hyper-V 2022 cluster, we build a new cluster with three Hyper-V 2022 hosts. Created the port profiles, the logical switch and logical networks through SCVMM. Placed a test VM on the cluster, made it high available and when powering on it triggered a blue screen on the host. Then the 2nd host noticed host nr1 is down and took over the VM, tried to power it on and then also BSODed. Then host nr 3 took over and also BSODed, etc, etc....
 The BSOD screens al show vmswitch.sys as the cause of the BSOD. We&#x27;re using Cisco blades and firmware / drivers are all at the level requested by Cisco. Windows 2022 is a fresh install with all the latest updates applied.
 My guess is maybe the UCS policy for the nics is not correct. VMQ settings? RSS? RSC? And this causing a BSOD because a conflict in settings???? 
 Can&#x27;t find any Cisco docs about specifically Windows 2022 Server Hyper-V on UCS.
 Any tips?

 Can anyone advise, the best way to set up an internal DNS deployment without any local compute? We have an AWS account which is connected via s2s vpn to local site. 
 Is it just to run a bunch of EC2 instances with BIND installed? I’m just wondering if I can leverage private hosted zones in R53 some way as we already use this for DNS management.
 TIA!

                              <span>As the subject says... but with a bit more detail. I&#x27;m looking for recommendations on:
  
Simple monitoring solution that can be installed on Linux
 Can be configured to monitor SNMP hosts
 Can import vendor specific MIB files (probably should go without having to say)
 Everything about the install/configure can be downloaded and installed in an air-gapped network (ie. packages, docker images, ova&#x27;s, etc)
 Email alerting
  
There&#x27;s lots of options out there for sure, Cacti, Nagios, LibreNMS, Zabbix, etc... I just need to quickly get something stood up that can start recording sensor (temp/power/fanspeed) values of some of our server hardware equipment.
 Bonus points if it can also be configured as a syslog server to be able to record and alert on activity logs.
 I know it&#x27;s a long shot but I figured I&#x27;d ask what folks are using.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been offered a sysadmin job at a small company where I would be the only IT/sysadmin person. My skills are more in software engineering, but the job was offered to me and thought I&#x27;d take it. The company heavily relies on Azure and the M365 suite for most things including MDM, but even with all of that functionality, there are 30+ applications/software/systems external to the M365 suite that I have to learn how to use and offer support for. I recently found out that the person who is currently the sysadmin is leaving probably a week after I join and has to pass all this knowledge on to me in that time, which I already know isn&#x27;t going to happen. Personally , it&#x27;s an immense amount of pressure on me being the only person who would have the role of a IT Technician/Sysadmin, especially when someone comes to you with a problem and lurks over you as they expect you to fix it there and then. Any suggestions on what I can do to make my life easier when starting this role and relieve some of the pressure? This is my first sysadmin job, not a massive noob, but I do lack experience though. Thanks :D

                              <span>Hello fellow admins! 
 I have a backup file of a server that I want to perform a checkdisk on.
 Now before I do that, because it holds valuable data, I was wondering what the best practice would be for creating a backup/local copy of that backup file.
 Is it safe to just use windows copy and paste or robocopy? Or is there a better way to copy that file? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Since a couple of weeks I notice that I get more UAC messages accessing random folders on Windows Servers that never gave an issue before, even when using a domain admin account (when logged in using RDP). In the past this folders never gave this problem. Access is also no problem. Today we noticed that a couple of desktop apps that are auto starting on a Windows Server did not start due to an exception (Exception Info: System.UnauthorizedAccessException). Starting the app as Administrator solves the startup. Anybody else seen this behaviour? Ii checked the UAC and that is not causing this.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and we will be dropping Cisco in the near future.
 We use Cisco firewalls (with ASA OS, not Firepower) mainly for their excellent VPN client, AnyConnect.
 What alternative firewall has the best VPN for end users?
 In sequence of importance we care about the following in a VPN solution:
  
Stability (shouldn&#x27;t drop the connection at first sign on network trouble)
 Support for 2FA
 Ease of use for end-user
 Ease of pushing new config to client
 Ease of initial installation
  
(The reason we are dropping Cisco is primarily because they have become impossible to deal with for SMB. We spend way too much time on licensing and contract renewal.)

                              <span>Hi!
 I just took over a super old setup and started digging through it all step by step. 
 I just came across some errors in the event log stating that a couple of certificates have expired back in 2020 and haven&#x27;t been renewed automatically. In this case it is on the primary DC holding all FSMO roles etc which is also CA.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience in this particularfield, so just want to be sure that I don&#x27;t break anything by just using the certificate renewal wizard to renew it, either with a new key or using the same key? :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>How does everyone approach patch management with software that lacks auto updates?
 Such as software you have to download an installer and run it as admin to update.
 You obviously can&#x27;t trust users to be able to handle this, it&#x27;s providing an open door to the system.
 At work we&#x27;re dealing with several peices of software that lacks auto updates across about 400 users. 
 The only solutions we can think of is manually remoting in and updating the software or giving certain members of staff admin access such as managers to run the install.
 Thoughts?

 &quot;I am trying to monitor Hyper-V and its VMs. I&#x27;ve tried using this template (https://github.com/a-schild/Zabbix-HyperV-Templates) to discover the VMs and their items, and it successfully discovered the VMs. However, the discovery rule to detect CPU, RAM, services, disk, and other metrics of the VMs did not work.
 So, my question is: Is there any other template available that I can use to monitor Hyper-V and its VMs, or do I need to install the Zabbix agent in each VM?&quot;
 Thanks.

                              <span>Dear fellow sysadmins, I&#x27;ve encountered something rather strange which I haven&#x27;t yet seen before and I&#x27;m unsure on how to resolve it / find the cause. I write this in the hopes that someone can point me in a direction where I might be able to find out more about the issue.
 System is running Windows 10 22H2 build 19045.2965, browser is Firefox v113.
 To the issue itself:
 When I try and reach https://www.\[domainname\].com it gives me an error and says &quot;Access Denied&quot; &quot;You don&#x27;t have permission to access &quot;http://www.\[domainname\].com/&quot; on this server.&quot;
 Which I find highly suspicious because being redirected to an http site might pose an security risk, which is why I believe the client/DNS cache and thus the system itself might be compromised... It&#x27;s only this one specific site that yields the issue.
 Have any of you encountered something like this? I&#x27;ve disabled all the browser&#x27;s addons, but to no avail. Just ran in-depth malware check on the system, but it yielded no detection at all...
 Any ideas what to do next/what to look for?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am facing a (hopefully solvable) problem, as I cannot directly influence some things. The following situation:
 Domain A is managed by DFN. The web server for domain A was provided by my employer. Due to lack of staff, web server provisioning has been discontinued. We received a backup before the shutdown. The administration of domain A should remain with DFN.
 We then purchased Domain B from STRATO, including the web server. There we imported the backup and made the site available again.
 Domain A is well known by everyone and appears high up in Google. Therefore domain A should be redirected to domain B without an underlying web server. The support at DFN has entered the IP address of the web server of STRATO for domain A, which appears by a ping. However, STRATO can apparently not process this request, so that when the IP is called, simply a &quot;Not found&quot; appears.
 The support at DFN has no idea, and I do not know enough about the subject. He said that this is due to the configuration of the web server at STRATO.
 How do I get the problem solved?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi, users are reporting that since this month&#x27;s update they have trouble logging in when the screen locks. IT discovered the reason is when the screen locks, the keyboard layout doesn&#x27;t default back to English like it normally did but stays at the current language being used. Users&#x27; passwords are always &quot;English&quot; since that&#x27;s what the keybord layout normally defaults on the lock screen. So they keep getting wrong password, until they mouse over to change the layout.
 I tested and it seems to be affecting Windows 10 (22H2) only. Windows 11 works as expected. Anyone else seeing this? All of our users use multiple layouts and it&#x27;s causing a lot of grief.

                              <span>Dear all,
 We have an incident with 2 RICOH SP 4510 DN printers because we can&#x27;t connect on the WEB interface of this one.
 The customer has many other RICOH models and no problem but the problem persists only with these 2 printers of the same model.
 There is no network blocking because the printer / workstations / print server is in the same subnet (We have checked anyway).
 We have updated the firmware of the 2 printers.
 We have reset both printers to factory settings.
 We have contacted RICOH support but they don&#x27;t help us much.
 We have reset the remote certificates on both printers.
 When we want to access the WEB interface, the error message is &quot;ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED&quot; as if the printer refused the connection.
 In the Ricoh firmware update software, the error message is &quot;Failed at TLS communication&quot; but there is no blocking at the network level and we can update the Firmware with no problem.
 This happens only with these 2 printers, for all other RICOH it&#x27;s ok everything works fine.
 In short, we have done everything but nothing to do unfortunately.
 Has anyone had a similar case / can anyone help us with this ?
 Best regards,

                              <span>I’m an IT manager at a small university. A user in our physics department has a Precision 3460 that was installed by my predecessor. In order to “increase security” on this box, the user decided to set both the system and admin passwords … and now has forgotten both. 
 After this machine is reformatted to its initial factory state, I’m going to have to hunt down all these machines and make sure users can’t get into the BIOS. 
 But I’ve never encountered quite this situation before. It used to be you could take out the CMOS battery for 30 seconds or so and the password(s) would be wiped. Not so, apparently, for the 3460. Googling and product manual searches yielded no help, so I’m appealing here for assistance. 
 Any ideas, folks?

                              <span>I had an on-site audit yesterday (account wasn’t old enough yet) and woke up a bit late. Heading there I wasn’t the most civil driver and when I was close to work I flicked off some slow driver that was clearly confused and wasting my time. I pulled into the parking lot and headed for the door only to see the offender pulling into out parking lot. Less than 15 minutes later we were introduced, turns out this man is our auditor. After a grueling day, I can only hope we pass. Felt like a lot of his findings were extra for some reason, no clue why… Don’t be like me, drive calm. 
 Anyone else have similar experiences? It’ll be a while before I live this down.

                              <span>Hi. Last year, I got an opportunity to work as Network security on a 1 year contract. Since I joined, my colleagues never liked me (they have been there for 15+ years and expected me to do what they tell me to do rather than working as a team). However, my manager have always been supportive of me and understood the dynamics of how my colleagues would underpin me being the new guy. Now my position became a full time but i have to reapply like all other applicants. Recently my manager hinted that someone else applied internally and he seems to be a good fit as he got along well with my current team and that guy has been referred from top management. And he suggested if I would be okay to continue working for another 1 year contract. I felt bad and hurt as I invested in couple of certs in this job hoping my hard work and my certs would make me a good candidate once the position becomes full time. My manager told me he likes how I am always calm and thoughtful and he told me to think about his plan. I didn’t express my emotions or said anything when he told me this news. Now should I tell him I was hoping to get this full time and hoping to be part of this company growing up the ladder. Or should I just stay silent and start applying elsewhere?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious, and have no idea of best practice here. In a Windows-centric environment where there are also a couple of Linux servers (Debian mostly), do you join the Linux servers to AD and use the AD-based admin accounts to administrate the Linux servers?

 Does anyone have any experience with a ransomware attack and working with the FBI or CISA?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just got back from 2 weeks vacation, looks like nobody covered my tasks when I was away and I&#x27;ve come back to 30 incidents in my work queue.
 On top of that I&#x27;ve been ringfenced for urgent project work for the rest of he week, and boss has said no excuses this &quot;must be top priority&quot;.
 I could:
 A) break my back with extra hours and try and pick off the urgent incidents while doing the project in the day job.
 B) work my regular hours, let SLAs fail and let the world burn.
 I&#x27;m going with option B this week, tough love. We have been a person down for 18 months while management say thay can&#x27;t find the right candidates, we have obliged by covering the holes, but I can&#x27;t any more - simply not enough hours to fit everything in for the foreseeable. Management have to learn we can&#x27;t go on!
 Let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s the right choice, because I know complaints will be a coming in.

                              <span>Hello there fellow emergency fighters! Obviously a throwaway due to privacy concerns :)
 Today is the day it happened :) After weeks and weeks (~12 - 16) of reporting fileserver issues and being told &quot;everything is fine only your team reports it and it happened twice now, meh&quot;. It became a bigger problem and took down our CRM, SAP and SharePoint for 2 - 3 hours which resulted in slow and terrible analysis roughly 6 weeks ago. Decisions were made, thrown away and then decided again.
 During this time the team I am part of had the main issues because automations took ages / timed out since the FS wasn&#x27;t always available or slow. 
 Guess what we learned on Friday? We didn&#x27;t create backups for the main share since end of April! Called in a contractor to go over everything and noticed bad sectors / partition starts corrupting. So tonight was supposed to be a full backup because we cannot risk anything, right???
 Well I told my team lead, who graciously got assigned on-call, that he should be prepared for dead scheduled tasks tomorrow morning or worse. He just send me a message &quot;10 people in a meeting - incl. head of infrastructure. Seemingly the partition died&quot;
 Well why have a call about a dead drive surely we deployed RAID XYZ? About that... Seems like we had 6TB of mission critical files on a single volume that was able to get completely corrupted by a single drive failure :) 
 Sure I knew that most of my coworkers aren&#x27;t topnotch but how in the devil&#x27;s name is that possible? I learned that shit in school. Legitimate feel like brushing up the CV if tomorrow turns out the way I think it will.

                              <span>So you have a business with an infrastructure supporting aging and end of life software. Your admins that know the business don&#x27;t know as much about modern systems because their full time job is supporting old stuff and doing stuff &quot;The way it&#x27;s always been&quot;.
 You know you need to modernize, so you go out to hire, but any admins with extensive experience in AzureAD, or whatever greatest trend is going, run the other direction once they learn your infra is SQL 2012R2. Who wants to step into a business 10 years in the past (and deal with the guys still there stuck in their ways)? Good admins want to have good tech.
 So you have outdated infrastructure because you can&#x27;t hire any admins that have kept their learning going. And you can&#x27;t hire any modern admins because you have outdated infrastructure.

                              <span>Hey guys, our organization is looking to add LAPS to our environment for local AD only. I have run across many guides for the older version of MS LAPS, but has anybody found or used any good guides for the new version? We are 100% Windows 10 at the moment but will be upgrading in the near future.
 I understand that most of the features are similar but that it is implemented differently, as well as being mostly integrated in Windows now. Any and all information is really appreciated. I know a lot of people have had issues upgrading, luckily, I won&#x27;t need to experience that.
 I have lots of individual questions, but a guide may answer most of them. Can anybody post your experience and references?
 Thanks guys.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been working in IT doing a mix of sysadmin, Helpdesk, Infrastructure, and cloud-magic for about a decade now. I hate to say it but I&#x27;ve noticed that, maybe starting about 2 years ago, I just don&#x27;t care about people&#x27;s IT issues anymore. 
 Over the past decade, all sorts of people come to me with computer issues and questions. Friends, Family, Clients, really just anyone that knows that I &quot;do computers&quot; has come to me for help. It was exhausting and incredibly stressful. So I set up boundaries, over the years the friends/family policy turned into &quot;Do not ask me for any IT help what so ever. I will not help you. There is no amount of money that will make me help you. I do not want to fix your computer, I am not going to fix your computer. I do not care what the issue is, find someone else&quot;
 Clients were a bit different as they are paying me to do IT work. But after so so SO many &quot;Help! When I log in, the printer shows up 10mins late&quot; and &quot;Emergency! The printer is printing in dark grey instead of black ink!!&quot; and general &quot;USB slow, please help, need antivirus&quot; I just honestly don&#x27;t care either. 
 Honestly, I&#x27;ve noticed I barely use a computer or tech in my free time, because I just don&#x27;t want to deal with it. 
 Has this happened to anyone else? Am I turning into an asshole? Am I getting burnt out?

                              <span>Hello to all, I have a bit of a chalange and would appreciate your imput:
 Company A hired a person called Adam. Company A agreed for a BYOD employment.
 Adam has a personal ONEDRIVE account which he uses to regularly backup his PC.
 Company A wants to fire Adam! How can they be sure:
 A. Adam copied all files from his PC to a drive he was given by company A B. Adam deleted all company files from his PC. C. Adam deleted all said files from onedrive recycle bin
 10x in advance.
 EDIT: Thank you everyone for your thoughts.
 I will say that I am not connected to said company (IT wise), I was just asked to consult as an external reference.
 I&#x27;ve already told management that they are f@#ked 😉 and that they should seriously rethink their BYOD policy.
 May we all have an error free week.

 Getting some weird behavior when logging in with full desktop vs RemoteApp with the Webclient. If I log in full desktop RDP, the reg keys I put into HKCU work great but when I use RemoteApp same user, it’s not seeing those same settings.
 Are user profiles and registry (specifically HKCU) for full RDP session different than when logging in via RenoteApp?
 Is there some kind of temporary profile created for RemoteApp connections?
 I’m not using any of the RDS settings for roaming profiles.
 Thanks for any help or ideas, Dan

                              <span>So here is my scenario... I work for an MSP and we currently have a client who still has a legacy configuration of old-school roaming profiles rather than folder redirection in place.
 I have been tasked with moving their current roaming profiles over to DFS namespace via folder redirection. Currently each person&#x27;s roaming profile sits on an old file server that needs to be decommissioned and this includes everything they have ever had in their Home directories.
 With this in mind, I have used robocopy to copy over all of the data where their Home directories exist now to the new location on a new file server.
 In Group Policy Management I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out the best GPO to deploy to ensure that their home directories (which are roaming) are correctly pointed to the new DFS path along with each person still having access to all of the data that they had in their old roaming profile.
 In the GPO I made under User Configuration &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Folder Redirection I need to ensure that each person will still have access to their data in their home drive while correctly redirecting their data to the DFS path.
 It&#x27;s a confusing task to me and any input would be appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>In Linux, we can use sandbox environments such as flatpak to secure high risk apps such as web browsers against 0 day attacks. Its very good since I can basically tell it for example which folders, files can a process access, or which devices it can access (webcam, etc). 
 So Is there any similar solution in Windows that doesn&#x27;t brick the performance of the app? Meaning, securing apps such as browsers against potential 0 day RCEs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a linux guy by trade, sysadmin, devops, system programming, etc.
 Sometimes I&#x27;m asked to do stuff on windows, usually powershell, and this is one of those cases, but I don&#x27;t understand the implications of what I&#x27;m asked to do and would appreciate pointers.
 I have a bunch of fileservers, I&#x27;m sending the logs to a graylog, I&#x27;m now asked to enable granular file access auditing, which users is accessing/creating/deleting which files.
 obviously there&#x27;s a bunch of permissions already set on the fileserver shares.
 I&#x27;m now playing with a test server and found out via ms documentation that I need to enable the file system auditing policy, I&#x27;ve done that (on my test server).
 then I see I have to enable autiding on the folder I intend to audit access to.
 two questions:
 1) should I also enable the Audit File Share policy?
 https://imgur.com/a/dftoXYk
 2) when I set the auditing on a folder I&#x27;m asked a principal, type, applies to and then basic permission, it&#x27;s the basic permission that are putting me off.
 https://imgur.com/a/10ulh6D
 I mean I understand (I think), the principal/type/applies to settings, for which principal should log events be generated, for which action, and if it applies recursively.
 but why should I set permissions in this tab? am I gonna overwrite the fileserver permissions when I enable this? and what is the thinking behind setting permissions here?

                              <span>Okay so I posted a question in the cybersecurity subreddit the other day about 2 different EDR solutions. The reason for the post is we are looking to remove our MSP and bring support inhouse. Which entails replacing the security stack with something new. I was at a conference last month and found out that Acronis now plays in this space.
 The question I pose to you is have you use their solution? NGAV/EDR/Backup/Email Filtering? All or some of it? Thoughts about it? From the brief overview I had of it, it seems pretty decent but once again it was just a brief overview and in a short time you can make anything look wonderful. Its only after a decent test do you see the flaws or benefits.

                              <span>I&#x27;m helping someone overhaul their network. They have dozens of unmanaged switches. 
 We moved a few windows PCs to a managed switch, and NLA breaks (doesn&#x27;t show connected to the domain network for NLA). Connectivity is fine to all the hosts on the subnet and can access dns / domain controller just fine. The pc&#x27;s at this time are configured for static IPs. (another issue I&#x27;m trying to fix). 
 When we move the pcs back to the unmanaged switches, NLA works as expected. I tested turning off igmp snooping, but of course that didn&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t) resolve it. 
 My google foo doesn&#x27;t seem strong for this one. 
 Any suggestions?

 Appart &quot;change the workflow that you have been used to for the past 20 years on Windows and countless linux environement&quot;, does anybody know of some kind of tool to &quot;linuxify/windowsify&quot; a Mac environment ?

                              <span>Hi Reddit Folks!
 I currently have Gsuite for less than 20 employees, at most 20gb of files on g-drive for a single user but most are under 5gb of use, we have a bunch of alias emails, don&#x27;t utilize any social aspect of the platform. Just straight email, storage of files, and collabs on spreadsheets.
 Instead of upgrading to Google workspace basic, I was looking into Microsoft O365 business standard which seems to be comparable in pricing and usage of storage, spreadsheets.
 My concern is how easy is it to configure the new O364 business account to use the domain name for emails, migrate users emails and files, and aliases? Anything else I would be missing to ask about for a migration or gotchas?
 Luckily, the environment is small and simple but I would imagine the same solution would apply for small businesses of 50-100 employees but open to any easy work around as well.
 Thanks for your help and time as I greatly appreciate it!

                              <span>Good day!
 We have a 2 node Windows 2012 R2 File server failover cluster. We did a rolling update to 2016 basically keeping the same IP addresses.
 However, after completion, Samsung printer scan to server suddenly stopped working.
 During the test it says it lost connectivity, however same IP and firewall rule is intact. AD Audit fails to collect security logs as well.
 However, Windows client still can access the file server VIP and DFS without issues.
 Is there some local policy difference between Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016 that we can check?
 Please take note that we haven’t upgraded the cluster functional level to 2016.
 Also, reverting the cluster back to 2012 fixes the issue. 
 Thank you all in advance!

 So as Microsoft server 2012 is approaching end of life, I want to move a old server that belong to a company to a newer server version. The server is running a journal system, and a Microsoft SQL (2014) database used by the journal.
 What is the cheapest Microsoft 2022 Standard edition license i can buy that include a SQL server? Any way of making the trancition as &quot;cheap &quot; as possible? upgrading license?

 ​
 It works fine for emails going to or originating from external email addresses (i.e. customers), but it&#x27;s not showing emails that originate internally. We have a hybrid environment, running Exchange 2016 on-prem. 
 ​
 Any thoughts on how to get internal emails to report?

                              <span>Hi Guys, 
 I am trying to map external mapped drives (shares from a different domain server) through group policy. 
 Since Microsoft no longer offer the ability to specify login details I can&#x27;t connect to drives using the different domain. 
 The users/servers are joined via site to site vpn so can access the servers, I&#x27;m just trying to automate the process so we don&#x27;t have to manually map these every so often. 
 Is the only way to do this via a script? I have tried using a script via group policy but they don&#x27;t seem to run correctly or end up failing for no real reason. (But work when ran locally) 
 Another thing to mention is there&#x27;s 2 security groups that need access to these, which have different permissions/access for files so will need 2 separate setups for each group. (Group is held on the external server)
 I understand the best method for this would be to have connected the DCs but the client was only willing to pay for essentials and the 2nd/external server came along later. 
 Any suggestions are appreciated!

 One server, 2 NICs
  
NIC 1: 192.168.251 - GW: 192.168.1.1
 NIC 2: 192.168.252 - No GW &lt;-- To keep (add same GW as above)
  
2 Internet connections (different providers):
  
Internet Connection 1: Internal IP 192.168.1.1 &lt;-- Will be shut down
 Internet Connection 1: Internal IP 192.168.1.2 &lt;-- To keep
  
NOTE: I&#x27;m working remote, and would very much like to avoid a trip on-site.
 Plan:
  
Add GW 192.168.1.2 to NIC 2
 Check everything works
 Then disable NIC 1
 Check everything still works
  
Problem:
 When I try to add GW 192.168.1.1 to NIC 2 in Step 1 above, I get:
  
Warning- Multiple default gateways are intended to provide redundancy to a single network(such as an intranet or the internet). They will not function properly when the gateways are on two separate, disjoint networks (such as one on your intranet and one on the internet). Do you want to save this configuration?
  
So here I am, needing your help 🐤
 Am I right in assuming, that I can ignore this warning and proceed?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>For several years we had a dedicated Dell rep and hardware specialist and they knew us extremely well. Every question we had they got us a quick answer, and knew how it tied in to our current products. 
 Somewhere around 2021 we started getting new reps every 6 months who don&#x27;t know anything and they just constantly try to sell us stuff. Our questions are rarely answered accurately and when they finally start to understand our needs we get a new rep. Is this happening with anyone else? Or maybe just the new norm since covid?

Cisco TAC says that according to the logs from the RTMT that Unity is timing out when communicating with Exchange, but not every time. Voicemails seem to be coming through quickly enough but when you mark the voicemail read in outlook, the message indicator light does not clear or if it does clear, it may take 15 - 20 minutes. We haven&#x27;t found any outstanding issues on our exchange server. Any thoughts on what to check? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Our company blocked the Microsoft Store for users on their Windows 11 laptops. Within the landscape they use a vulnerability scanning tool and there is a vulnerability in the AV1 Video Extension, so an update is needed from version 1.1.52851.0 to 1.1.60961.0.
 I tried to update the app with the following options, without any luck:
  
Setting Catalog -&gt; Auto update apps in Store
 
Pro active remediation script that checks the version and if outdated, run the following:
 $namespaceName &#x3D; &quot;root\cimv2\mdm\dmmap&quot; $className &#x3D; &quot;MDM_EnterpriseModernAppManagement_AppManagement01&quot; $wmiObj &#x3D; Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespaceName -Class $className $result &#x3D; $wmiObj.UpdateScanMethod()
 
Deploy the AV1 Video Extension within Intune apps
 
Winget. Installed Winget and executed the command below:
 Winget upgrade -h --id Microsoft.AV1VideoExtension_8wekyb3d8bbwe --force
 
 Winget Output &#x3D; no applicable upgrade found, while its still on the old version.
 So i tried different things without luck. I also tried it on another laptop with the Microsoft Store available, and then i can upgrade using the command below and it will updated to the latest version 1.1.60961.0 . Whats happening here?
 $namespaceName &#x3D; &quot;root\cimv2\mdm\dmmap&quot; 
 $className &#x3D; &quot;MDM_EnterpriseModernAppManagement_AppManagement01&quot; $wmiObj &#x3D; Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespaceName -Class $className $result &#x3D; $wmiObj.UpdateScanMethod()

                              <span>Bit of a &#x27;rubber ducky&#x27; post here. I believe I&#x27;ve covered all the usual stuff before lighting candles, drawing floor markings and taking up day drinking. 
 We&#x27;ve a few servers on one host (smallish firm) and our main App is hosted on this particular 2016 VM. However, it has really thrown the toys out of the pram with updates. 
 ​
  
I&#x27;ve tried manually installing updates from the M U Catalog. Constantly getting - 0x80070490 in Event Log. 
 I&#x27;ve manually - restarted services, renamed Catroot2 and SoftwareDistribution folders, reset winsock, rebooted. 
 Tried a trusty script which does the above and more, which has worked previously for other servers and workstations (Stop services, rename folders, rename previous log, reset updates services, re-registered DLLs, cleared regkeys, reset winsock, reset BITS Transfers, and start services).
 I&#x27;ve removed AV and Malware protection just in case but that changed nothing.
  
​
 Beginning to think it&#x27;s a blow it away and start over job but that&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare with it being our main LOB app. Plus the time and costs to get the supplier to install and shift to a new VM. Usually the bottom 3 in that list of 4 has worked in my previous experiences but this just will not play ball. The other 2016 VMs are humming along nicely, 2019 all good and W10 machines all patched fine. 
 Any other ideas before I start making phone calls?

                              <span>I am not an IT guy. I understand computers, i like data, but I&#x27;m a front office guy at a financial firm. I am convinced that our back office tech and IT teams are completely incompetent, but i don&#x27;t know what to do about it.
 We have a useless website that is supposed to be a CRM, but it doesn&#x27;t integrate with a single piece of microsoft 365 (which is being paid for to be used by every single member of every firm) and theres no adobe integration to the sharepoint. Everything is done manually, by us at the front office. My job is supposed to be sales, but i spend 90% of my time doing admin. 
 Notionally, I understand how this tech is supposed to work... we pass adobe documents around for new data, which is integrated to the website via sharepoint lists, then we pull 3rd party data from APIs to fill the gaps. In practice, I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s job it should be to actually build this shit and who is responsible for the failures of the current system. 
 It seems like nobody is even speaking my language and I need to hear experts tell me that what I am envisioning is normal, its not difficult, and I&#x27;m not crazy.
 Ive taken on the mentality of &quot;if you want something done right, do it yourself&quot; to try and build little automations the best i can, but barely anything sticks. 
 Is this an lost cause? Should I simply give up and hope that my bosses hire more admin to keep this glaring issue out of sight and out of mind, or should i be concerned that without these basic process management systems in place, our business will never scale?

                              <span>Lets think about a confernce or visitors, I want a tool (webpage ideally) that I can restrict and give to certain &quot;front of house&quot; or reception staff to create temporary short term access (24hrs , 3 days etc) that provide limited services (like internet) etc, by placing them in a group in the AAD / AD (which will be defined when I setup the tool). 
 I believe I have seen a tool like this before, something they can use to create these accounts, or bulk upload too. Its then a portal the receptionist can utilise.
 Has to be idiot proof (so to speak) and be very &quot;wizardy&quot; in its simplicity. 
 Anyone know of such tools? Or recommendations?

                              <span>Yes, I am the idiot and I 100% see it. But is there ANY recovery method available to fix this?
 Basically, on a NAS there were multiple iSCSI mount points in a target LUN from a NAS. 2 mount points with the same disk space. 1 was originally mounted into a Windows server as NTFS.
 I was trying to mount the second mount point into ESXI as Datastore and realized soon enough that it was the wrong disk that got formatted. 
 Is there ANY way I can revert this and try to save the data for the NTFS volume? As this was a backup point, there are no copies for the data on this drive. I have not deleted the Datastore from the esxi as there is a warning it will try to delete all data (trying to preserve any more writes on it) :(

                              <span>Apologies if this is the wrong place. I trust the mods will let me know.
 I&#x27;m trying to get some work out from underneath me a few weeks before it&#x27;s due in order to free up my schedule and also because it would give me a considerably longer leash at work. What I&#x27;m trying to do is write out some SNMP monitoring rules for a Bosch IP camera, but I don&#x27;t have access to the device yet in order to figure out what to monitor.
 We&#x27;re using a really rudimentary SNMP monitoring system where you give it the OID and it monitors it for a response within the guidelines you give it. I wish we&#x27;d migrate to something more intelligent but you play the hand you&#x27;re dealt.
 What I&#x27;d normally do is:
  
Run an SNMP walk on the device using its MIB (which I have)
 Confirm the MIB against the walk to make sure the numbers line up
 Strip out the stuff I can&#x27;t monitor against/don&#x27;t care about
 Make the monitor using the OIDs that remain
  
Here I don&#x27;t have the device, all I have is the MIB. Looking at it, I can see that – for example – &quot;temp-sens&quot; is &quot;1.3.6.1.4.1.3967.1.1.7.1.1 &quot; , but that&#x27;s only so useful to me because I can&#x27;t tell from the MIB whether I should be expecting anything after this to denote the individual sensor (&quot;.1.1&quot;, for example).
 Loading the MIB into various freeware programs does not make this immediately apparently either.
 Is there any technowizardry I can do ahead of time to denote the various sensors on the device (or at least tell if the MIB expects them) or is the only true indication of a device&#x27;s SNMP capabilities taken from inspecting the device itself?

 I&#x27;m looking for a company that will help us buy Lenovo laptops in India, Bangalore.
 We would be paying from the UK bank. Maybe someone knows a reseller that can help us do it faster than waiting weeks?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve been working lately on collecting performance data for my Windows server environment.
 I am collecting various performance statistics and I have a question about a specific value for servers with Hyper-v role.
 I have a question for the value &#x27;System Current Pressure&#x27;, which is provided by &#x27;Hyper-v Dynamic Memory Balancer&#x27;.
 This value is always 100 on every server I have reviewed. I realize that the &#x27;Average Pressure&#x27; value is more important and I collect and monitor its value.
 I can&#x27;t find on Microsoft&#x27;s sites an exact description of what this parameter refers to and what it means. I checked it on a server that did not have a single virtual machine and this value is also equal to 100.
 There is also a similar value in another category &#x27;Hyper-v Dynamic Memory VM&#x27; and here the values are different for virtual machines which makes sense. Value of 100 means that the machine has reached its RAM limit and you should investigate whether to allocate more or perform optimization.
 The question is what does this value mean for &#x27;Hyper-v Dynamic Memory Balancer&#x27;?

                              <span>I head up the IT for a high turnover company in the UK. Previous to my arrival at the company a SAAS solution was purchased and at the time of purchase no administrative details were given to the business. I&#x27;ve reached out to the software company who are also based in the UK to request for administrative access to the system but they&#x27;ve refused unless we undergo a £400 3hr training course (and pass it based on their &#x27;feeling&#x27;). The system isn&#x27;t anything complicated, and our account manager is somewhat of a dinosaur and doesn&#x27;t understand the basics of the day to day regulatory requirements of running an IT service it just seems to be a bit of a &#x27;being difficult&#x27; situation. Does anyone know if there&#x27;s anything that goes against some form of legality etc if a software company that sells software to withold administrative access to the customer so they can generate more business in doing so? (ontop of a very hefty annual bill they are charging per new task).

 So, I have a couple of DELL PowerStore systems that have expired support contract, it expired mid-February, both system run old version of PowerStore OS. My question is, is it possible and/or legal to upgrade the PowerStore OS to version released BEFORE the support contract expired?
 Does anybody have any experience with such things?

 Just for reference, only a small MSP with 3 users, and we basically only use lastpass for the shared folders feature. The amount of data we&#x27;ve got is irrelevant for moving it across as it goes back 8+ years, and a lot of is legacy stuff we basically don&#x27;t need anymore, so ease of migration isn&#x27;t a factor

                              <span>After the spam filter incident in Outlook around February it never actually seemed to be resolved for us and our clients (Mainly based in Germany). Many legitimate emails with DKIM &amp; SPF aligned either get filtered to spam on our side or their side. Sometimes even being quarantined all together. The bothering part is that it happens even in mail conversations so it seems like you’ve never received an answer or invite. Do you guys experience this too and or have a solution to this?

                              <span>Hi!
 Thinkpad 14s is connected to Dell monitor with type-C cable. The problem is that half the times Windows 10 does not recognize monitor.
 I cannot simply add HDMI cable because next day it works again and the combo show black. I want to retain type-C for charging and data (kbd, cam, mouse) but not for display. For display I want to use HDMI cable which is 100% reliable. Disabling Thunderbolt 4 in BIOS didn&#x27;t disable video. Is there any registry value to change or device to disable.

                              <span>It appears I am back here again hoping someone can help. I am re-trying downloading the Eaton IPM VMware source from the Eaton website, but every device I try from - azure, Singapore, Australia etc - the download stops at about 330Mb with the error &quot;This download was interrupted&quot;.
 I dont think this is happening in the US - the download link is https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/products/backup-power-ups-surge-it-power-distribution/power-management-software-connectivity/eaton-intelligent-power-manager/software/ipm-version-2/eaton-ipm-vmware.zip - there wouldn&#x27;t be someone kind enough to download it for me somewhere I can collect it?
 I am also having trouble getting a trial Activation ID from the website. I only need IPM for 30 days as we go to colocation then. I&#x27;ve filled in the form for both the USA and Europe request, I get the email asking me to confirm the email address, click, but never receive the Activation ID.
 Ive spoken to support who say it is a &quot;marketing&quot; issue and they don&#x27;t know what to do. I would give my left leg and first ugly child if someone could assist.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure how odd this will sound, but I&#x27;d like to reach out and gauge how much dev work some of you do. There is a bit of a fuzzy line with devops nowadays, as well as X as code, plus scripting is a way of writing code as well.
 So where does sysadmin end, then? I often find myself adjusting or extending the source code of FOSS Software we use as well, is this still part of a sysadmin job or have I veered over into dev territory?
 We&#x27;re a small team and there&#x27;s not a whole lot in terms of automation. And obviously no devops since we don&#x27;t have any devs. This, in combination with me being a junior/early in my career and also having had an interest in programming as a hobby has led to me feeling like I lack a proper frame of reference on what is normal for a modern sysadmin. It has also led to a severe case of double imposter syndrome as I feel like I am faking being a dev AND an admin while doing neither of the two properly.
 Are any of you in a similar position or want to share your thoughts? Should I specialise more or stick with my somewhat special &quot;stuck between worlds&quot; approach? I really love the way it makes me fit into my current team as it makes me feel like really having an impact by pushing us forward by automating and streamlining workflows. But at the same time I worry that it&#x27;ll make it extremely hard to find a new job if I have to as other employers will likely look for some kind of specialist whereas I&#x27;ve cranked the generalist knob way past 11.
 Small disclaimer: I know that usually there&#x27;s teams for different parts of sysadmin (networking, security, systems, etc) but as stated, we&#x27;re small and just a handful of people so we have to wear several hats anyway.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Wanted to bring up the topic of project management methodologies, particularly Scrum.
 I work as an operations manager part of a small IT team composed of various roles including server admin, cloud admin, network engineer, and a few helpdesk techs.
 ​
 As an infrastructure team, we are tasked with all kinds of different projects and tasks. We currently do not have any formal project management framework to work with and that causes a slew of issues including lack of focus/momentum, projects getting forgotten about, scattered priorities, and constantly jumping on the fire of the week, just to name a few.
 Recently, I started down the path of trying to implement Agile Scrum to solve our issues. I feel that the agile method of iterative progress/accomplishments will work well for us…</span>

 however i did some research and seems like engenius fit is a new product and will prob come out to similar price as the unifi install.
 is there a reason for me to run engenius fit over unifi? or should i stick with unifi?
 thx

                              <span>So I am trying to understand the need to have both on our network. 
 Currently finishing up a network upgrade that included a lot of new things, but some of the main things were adding Cisco ISE for radius and tacacs. Another part is adding wireless to our network for the first time. Wireless is all Aruba and we are using clearpass to authorize wireless clients. APs are all Aruba, and also using AIRwave.
 So basically two AAA servers. One for wireless and one for wired. 
 From my understanding, you can do wireless authentication with ISE though. ISE can authorize your wired and wireless clients, all on one device. 
 Is it really necessary to have both aruba clearpass and Cisco ISE on the network? I asked my boss why have both, and his response was so we don’t have to manually enter client mac addresses, I guess they populate when the person connects to the Wi-Fi and then we can place them into the right vlan. But in my experience, ISE does the same thing with wired clients. They get placed into a dead group not associated with a vlan, and then we can assign them to a group. But usually we have them assigned before they connect. 
 My issue with having two devices for aaa is having to manually enter macs in two different devices. We are a building that hosts a lot of short term guest with lots of BYOD devices. So we are always receiving lists of MAC addresses that get approved and need added into ISE. It can be a pain especially when getting calls because of connection issues then finding out it’s because someone can’t tell the difference between their wireless mac and wired Mac, plus typos and other errors. I just feel it’s unnecessary to have two devices if it can be handled by one. So just wondering if there is a bigger reason why clearpass and ISE are needed that I may be missing?
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m looking for 60mmWave solution to allow me to do a point-to-point solution to connect two properties we own that are across the street from each other. Curious what everyone&#x27;s experience with Cambium has been? They seem to have a following, but I&#x27;m curious what actual users think.

                              <span>Hello All, I am currently working on adding an additional GRE tunnel to a cloud vendor with the intention of filtering PC traffic over for inspection. To my knowledge there are two ways I can go about this, see below.
 ​
 Option 1. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with a higher routing priority &amp; distance which would result in the route not being active in the routing table of the Fortigate. Then create policy routes to perform the actual routing. My manager prefers to stay away from policy routes.
 Option 2. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with the same distance &amp; priority. The new route will populate in the active routing table, then create firewall policies around that static route. Please see my concerns below.
 If my Fortigate firewall has a simple LAN &gt; WAN firewall policy and the policy only includes the LAN and WAN1 interfaces and NOT the GRE tunnel inteface. If I add another 0.0.0.0/0 static route (GRE Tunnel) to my routing table with the same distance and priority. Does the Firewall start performing ECMP even though the destination interface is not included with the LAN &gt; WAN policy? I would imagine it might because of the static route being in the active routing table.
 ​
 Thanks!

 being as this is the first time we&#x27;re/i&#x27;m doing this, can you guys fill me in on common and not-so-common things to look out for when implementing bgp? like how long does this outage typically take, common troubleshooting/problem areas, etc. 
 from my very basic understanding, the routes from ISP1 will be advertised to ISP2 and vice versa to create redundancy. these new routes will have to be put in manually by all parties in their respective routers simultaneously. also, we will need a (new) /24 block to do the advertising. that&#x27;s pretty much the extent of what i know. again, it being the first time bgp-ing i can&#x27;t help but feel nervous about something that&#x27;s probably routine to a lot of you here.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into how my own ISP works. They have transit providers; wholesale downstream ethernet providers and rack space in a single datacenter from what I can see. I think it&#x27;s something like this:
 Transit ISP ---&gt; Datacenter ---&gt; Wholesale Broadband MPLS Net ---&gt; BRAS ---&gt; DSLAM ---&gt; CPE
 How does IP addressing work in a small tier 2 ISP such as this? Now this may be because of my lack of subnetting knowledge but I&#x27;m under the impression that each router interface will have a unique subnet.
 Therefore, would the subnetting look like this assuming there is no hardware redundancy (for simplicity of this example)?
  
 Transit ---&gt; Aggregation Switch A (/30) 
  
 Aggregation Switch ---&gt; Core Router B (/30) 
  Core Router ---&gt; Wholesale Ethernet MPLS C (/30) 
  Customers D (/24) Some form of NAT 
 
 If anyone has a detailed diagram of an ISP that utilizes wholesale broadband MPLS I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. Are customers generally assigned private IP addresses and then NAT is used or how does this work?
 Appreciate any advice or pointers towards resources. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, I wanted to reach out to others and see if anyone has any good recommendations for network diagraming software for a web interface. EG i have a program a wrote that maps out everything thats connected to all my devices, and now i want to be able to pipe that information into a mapper to generate some diagrams. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m in the correct place as my knowledge on these matters is limited. 
 I&#x27;m looking for a way of changing the my IP addresses to areas in the states without using traditional VPN&#x27;s. I work in the adult entertainment industry and we continually see persecution on social media platforms and regularly find ourselves IP banned. Also engagement is also much better in the US. 
 Is there a way of creating a unique VPN that relies on an IP address that isn&#x27;t widespread? The issue with some VPN providers is that the social media websites know it belongs to a VPN and we notice considerable drops in engagement and explore.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>How does port 80 and port 443 comes into picture? . Let’s say I make web application with python which runs on port 5000. Now this has http protocol which means unencrypted traffic follow and port 80 is used for encrypted traffic. So if my web server is exposed at 5000 and is handling unencrypted traffic where does port 80 comes in play ? . Same for port 443 (in this case I have a python web application with ssl or tls certificate). 
 Also Is there tool that will show the flow of traffic port to port for my python application ?

                              <span>So, we have a cluster of firewalls at a client that loose Internet connectivity every few months. Just like that. LAN continues to work but WAN goes dark. They do respond to ICMP on the WAN side but do not process user traffic. No amount of troubleshooting can bring them back up working so.. we do reboot that &quot;fixes&quot; things.
 One time, second time, and today - for the third time. 50 developers can&#x27;t work and ask why, what&#x27;s the issue? We bought industry leading firewalls, why? 
 We ran there, downloaded the logs from the devices and opened a ticket with the vendor. The answer was, for the lack of better word - shocking: 
 1) Current Firewall version XXX, we recommend to upgrade device to latest version YYY (one minor version up)
 2) Uptime 59-60 days is really high, we recommend to reboot firewall once in 40-45 days (with a maintenance window)
 3) TMP storage was 96% full, this happens due to long uptime of appliance
 ​
 The last time I felt this way was when some of the rookies went over to replace a switch and turned off the AC in the server room because they had no hoodies, and forgot to turn them on. On Friday evening... 
 So, how often do you reboot your firewalls? :) And guess who the vendor is.

 I&#x27;ve been using 802.1x for SSTP VPN and EAP-TLS WiFi no issues. Using NPS server to do the auth and certs being issued by an AD PKI CA server..
 I&#x27;m trying to setup a Sophos Switch with EAP-TLS, or even EAP-MSCHAPv2 .. I setup my users computer to use either EAP-TLS or EAP-MSCHAPv2 (using either Device or User cert, with a corresponding NPS policy to match) , however when trying to auth against the switch, the NPS shows the logs:
 Network Policy Server denied access to a user.
 Contact the Network Policy Server administrator for more information.

                              <span>Hi, I wanted to know if there is a device that can select between several transceivers and use only one signal at a time, like a channel selector kind of thing. I&#x27;m aware of CWDM multiplexors, but that is way more complex than what Im looking for. What Im seeking for is a way to connect several transceivers pairs and to send traffic between them, but selecting one pair at time. This &quot;adapter&quot; will be connected to one SFP+ port of a switch, so the idea is to test each transceiver pair without disconnecting it from that switches port.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

 Planning on adding a IB fabric to a cluster in the near future and not sure where to start with IB as there’s little documentation for MS-MPI.

Can I host this using GlobalProtect, so that the users can download the rdp file and connect to it using ldap/ad credentials? So basically users will browse to the website hosted on PA, login and download rdp file to connect. Thanks in advance,

                              <span>Recently our two companies merged the majority of their processes and I knew the project of a network merge was on the horizon. 
 Thankfully the buildings are physically attached and we have some connections already shared. So just curious if you guys have any pointers on where to start. There is going to be a ton of information I need to capture. Sine I inherited one of the networks and am still learning all the subnets and Vlans. 
 If anyone has done this in the past themselves is there anything you wish you would have known off the jump? Do a little differently?
 Thanks a ton guys!

                              <span>Hi All - My company has two Cisco 7010’s strung together in the datacenter via HSRP and 20+ SVI’s between the two. Closet switches off of each 7010 switch. No endpoint is dual homed. Some closet switches go to one switch, others the 2nd switch. Only one 7010 has an upstream static route to the router and no routing exists between the switches. They want to insert a Palo Alto firewall between the two 7010’s in order to keep some outside traffic off the 2nd 7010. 
 I can’t get a second connection to the router. I cant re-ip the network. I cant get a routing protocol on the router. I cant have more than 4 hours downtime. I have to implement a PA between the two. 
 Any thoughts on a good way to do this? Besides just burn the whole network down and start over???
 Thanks

                              <span>I make 190 including bonus. Benefits are good. 100% wfh Job is easy. I probably work 25 hours a week. 
 Two questions 1. I have an offer to work as a contractor for 18 months. 290k. It is in LAX. No wfh. Would you take it? I have to quit current job. 
  
Thinking about getting a master degree in cloud or cybersecurity so that I can teach at community college for night classes and online classes. I can potentially generate 120k if I get to teach 12 units per each semester. Obviously not guaranteed that I will get an offer. Or would you go for CCIE for higher income?

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m looking for a nudge in the right direction. I have prepared a diagram which you can access here: https://imgur.com/a/3LTIPUe 
 I have several metering devices on several different locations. Each location has the same topology: 
  
one router with local IP 10.10.100.1 (LTE enabled)
 2 metering devices with local IPs 10.10.100.2 and 10.10.100.3 respectively.
  
I cannot change the local IPs (orange in the diagram) on any of these 3 devices, as they are already in use by other systems. Every other IP or setting on the routers or the pfsense cloud router is under my control and can be changed.
 Now, I have an OpenVpn server on a cloud pfsense VM, and everything is set-up and connected through the internet already and I can access every router on a different address on the 10.30.0.0…</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 Full disclosure, I’m not an IT person, I work in live events and had some weirdness going on today at a convention center and was curious if there was some guidance here. 
 Essentially I had two laptops wired into a dumb switch DHCP and they were golden. 
 I tried my personal Lenovo thinkpad wired into the same switch a bit later and was unable to get internet using dhcp. I checked and it kept auto connecting me to a gateway that was unused by the it department. Mind you, using wifi, internet worked fine on dhcp, but not wired. 
 They were pretty quick to shrug and say not my problem since the other laptops were working, but they were nice enough to designate me a static ip and the laptop is now working while wired.
 I’m just really trying to understand why this would happen, as I’ve used my laptop at plenty of venues and never experienced this. I reset the network from the status settings , I released and renewed dhcp from the command prompt, all to no avail. 
 I was trying to stop and start my dhcp certificate but was running into an error 5 code and unable to do it even though Im the primary user. 
 Curious if anyone has experienced this, and if there’s any guidance on how to deal with this in the future. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Good Evening gents,
 My business is currently looking at Forti client on the endpoint to connect remotely to the office. We are currently using Citrix cloud to connect remotely to a shared environment and Zscaler ZPA to connect to specific app that doesn&#x27;t fit Citrix Shared app. (mainly used for consultant and external.)
 As a Network admin, I&#x27;m not super keen about going with FortiClient and EMS, I&#x27;ve always had issue in the past concerning latency, crash, connection not establishing, etc... I also don&#x27;t find it to be super secure for our network. Note that I&#x27;m the only network admin ATM.
 Lastly, can one man really support a VPN for 300 end users?
 I&#x27;d like to know your experience &amp; your thought about using Forti SSL VPN / ZTNA.

                              <span>First time swapping out some 2960-X&#x27;s with 9200&#x27;s and when I was checking the ports prior to repatching neither a Fluke LinkRunner or netAlly AirCheck would detect PoE on a 9200 port. Both worked fine on a 9300.
 Plugging in a WAP and a phone worked okay so I could continue on but it&#x27;ll be a pita going forward if I can&#x27;t check/test PoE using the tools.
 Before I start in depth testing, has anyone come across this?
 I have a fancy new LinkRunner 10G coming so hopefully that&#x27;ll work.

                              <span>Does anyone have experience with 2+ mile wireless point-to-point solutions? I&#x27;ve done a few airFiber solutions under 2 miles and start to have issues making out possible obstructions with binoculars and my phones zoom feature. I also use the Ubiquiti UISP Design Center to get a ballpark figure on geographical obstructions. I was thinking of using a cheap telescope, but I don&#x27;t want to haul it up a ladder on top of a roof. Would something like a spotting scope work, or does anyone with experience in the have suggestions?

                              <span>Inherited a small branch site with an N1524 as their core. It&#x27;s connected to a couple other sites via IPSEC tunnel. Connectivity to all devices but the Dell switch from outside the branch office works fine, but I can&#x27;t even ping the thing unless I&#x27;m on that LAN.
 It doesn&#x27;t appear to be firewall related, and I&#x27;m wondering if there might be some ACL or other service on the Dell switch preventing access to it outside the LAN. 
 I have a login to the CLI but that&#x27;s about it. I tried thumbing through Dell&#x27;s documentation but didn&#x27;t find anything glaring when I tried printing the config.
 edit - I did note it was on an 8 year old firwmare version and updated it several releases. Still, no luck.

                              <span>Hi guys. My company has 2 ISPs that we use in an active/backup configuration. Each ISP has a single ethernet handoff that we connect into an external switch (switch for ISP 1 and another for ISP 2). Each ISP has 2 circuits.
 How common is this setup? If we were to have 1 circuit per ISP would this make things more difficult for us? Why don&#x27;t we have 2 handoffs per ISP? I guess this failover is handled by the ISP router? Quite a few questions here but I&#x27;m trying to demystify this!

 Today Wireshark asked to update and I agreed. My current version of Wireshark is 4.0.5, OS is Windows 10. After the update I lost ability to see packet data in packet details window.
 Here&#x27;s what it looks like now: https://i.ibb.co/ZgxfpRh/Screenshot-2023-05-15-204241.png
 How to return the ability to see the text, and not just the bytes in the lower right window?

                              <span>We have 2 dark fibers running between 2 datacenters. The fibers are each 50km in length. We use a dwdm on each site with 100Gbit gbics qsfp28. We get around 0,550 / 0,600 ms in ping. Is this normal for this length ? We measure it with a Linux servers on both ends connected with 100Gbit dac to a switch that has the 100Gbit gbics in it and the dark fiber connected.

                              <span>Hi everyone, looking for help from the community. Quick background, I am a system admin for our small business just a little under 100 employees, fully remote using VPN. Our current setup is using a Sophos Firewall SG230 and we will need a replacement before 2025 due to EOL support, so I am being proactive and looking at new equipment right now.
 I&#x27;m not sure what other information would be helpful in determining a replacement, but lets assume all things be equal? (generally) 
 I am in charge of finding a replacement, I am mainly a system admin, not networking admin so bare with my lack of needed knowledge. I know enough about using firewalls, but not when it comes to replacing it.
 Question:
 Anyone have any recommendations are similar firewalls to the Sophos SG230 that would be a good upgrade/replacement?

I have a 3560 on one end, and a Nexus 9K on the other. How can I specify which VLANs to carry on the inside of the Q-in-Q? Everything I read on dot1q-tunnel just seems like it carries all the vlans in the table, and I don&#x27;t want it to carry hundreds of VLANs. I have zero experience with this protocol. Any help is greatly appreciated.

 In my daily job i&#x27;m a network engineer/architect. Are there any tips on learning and eventually mastering Python while working in the Networking branche? What i mean is: would you still recommend a course like Automate the Boring Stuff or maybe something else? Cause maybe I&#x27;m just too enthousiastic, but my goal is to add Python as an &quot;addon&quot; to my daily networking jobs.

                              <span>Can someone help me differentiate route vs policy VPN on Fortigates? All our VPNs have specific encryption domains, firewall policies referencing the tunnel interface and a route for the remote-side in the routing table. Is this considered policy or route? Is the only difference an encryption domain of 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 ?
 If my existing VPNs have specific encryption domains and I add a tunnel for 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 is that going to cause problems?

                              <span>I run IT at a small K12 school. One of my summer projects is to run fiber optic cable to an outbuilding. I did this last year to a different outbuilding and it worked great.
 Sad Story (optional)
 The one PITA part was fishing the FOC into the innerduct at the beginning. I got 1/2&quot; non-split LDPE, thinking that it would better protect the FOC than split tubing would. Well, that backfired because after I ran the cable ALL the way through the underground conduit and plugged it in, it didn&#x27;t work! I ordered a new cable, repeated the tedious process
 The Actual Question
 Should I use split or non-split innerduct? The split kind would be easier right? I could just sideload the cable all the way down, right?
 The cable will run through our attic (wood trusses and cinder block walls), down the exterior wall and in gray PVC in a trench across the yard to the outbuilding, and then up the wood stud wall into the nearest room.
 Currently planning to use this LDPE from eBay (with the ends taped together) if split is OK.
 Bonus: the cable is OS2 LC/LC UPC Plenum-rated (OFNP), as per local networking guy.
 Originally posted in r/FiberOptics last week, but I&#x27;m looking for more input. I&#x27;m particularly interested in the rationale behind your opinion.

 I have an integration of FreeRADIUS and LDAP running on IPA server. it works well but the FreeRADIUS config requires a user that can read LDAP and for this a password has to be stored in cleartext.
 Is there a way to achieve the Radius -&gt; LDAP authentication without storing a users&#x27; password in cleartext on the RADIUS server?

                              <span>So I am learning networking and have been interested in this setup of having:
 Transit BGP ---&gt; Switch ---&gt; Router
 This is a consideration due to a lack of router ports. It is my understanding that you can use a switch as an aggregation device sort of how a breakout cable would work. I&#x27;m concerned that this setup would impact BGP at the layer 4 but I am not sure?
 Are there any other disadvantages of my proposed topology? Would it be bad practice to also have downstream services via the same switch?

                              <span>I want to analyse which IP networks are passing through different uplinks. I don&#x27;t want (and can&#x27;t) peek into traffic itself. I just want to generate stats that can be graphed and easily correlated with my routing tables. Before jumping into writing some kind of homebrew pipeline to feed into influx or other tsdb, I want to check if there are existing solutions. Any advice guys?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a gap in my knowledge that I would appreciate being filled regarding running out of ports. I noticed that routers such as the MX204 only have 4x100Gbe ports. I&#x27;m new to networking and don&#x27;t fully understand how this works but I&#x27;m fairly sure people use a switch to &#x27;extend&#x27; these ports.
 For example, a 100GB port could become 10x10Gb virtual interfaces. I realize that I may have gotten some terminology incorrect here but would appreciate any help with pinning down what this is called and how it works.
 Thanks for any help!
 Edit: And does this work only for downstream or can you also &#x27;extend&#x27; upstream ports?

                              <span>Howdy, all,
 Just curious to know if anyone has any practical experience/comments on a Netscout 7120 PFS or similar “qualified” hardware. I’m hoping someone in the financials may be using this and is doing so with a relatively high rate of traffic.
 My concern is buffer space as a relates to microbursts. We currently use Arista 7150s which are slated for decommissioning in favor of the 7280 platform, and that old platform drops traffic like crazy, but for a new deployment the leadtime on the 7280 is way too long, so we’re looking at the Netscout side of things.
 Unfortunately, I don’t have a good indication of throughput requirements as yet, however, on paper, it’s possible it may fit the bill.
 Unfortunately, I’ve asked Netscout to put me in touch with existing clients to which they have not done so and have simply indicated that they have “received no complaints.”
 So, is anyone using this particular platform, and if so, have you seen any issues related to frame drops?

 Can anyone tell me why it&#x27;s not working? I last set the NAS&#x27;s NIC&#x27;s to: 
 EEE 802.3ad (Dynamic Link Aggregation): This mode requires a compatible network switch that supports Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) or EtherChannel. It provides load balancing and fault tolerance by distributing network traffic across the bonded interfaces. 
 ​
 I have an OPNSense which is doing the routing.. Not getting anything
 I do not want to reset the network settings..

                              <span>Hello, I am investigating Ruckus as for our future APs and switches, and wondering about Google SSO to access WIFI, which seems to be supported. This would help us blocking former staff and students from accessing our networks as soon as respective Google accounts are suspended.
 Random questions: 
  
Can users be assign to specific VLANs depending on a sort of ACLs or groups of users? 
 Could this work using only one SSID or would a secondary SSID be required for guests?
 How would you manage guests for a temporary access?
 
 Any experience on this matter?

                              <span>In a network I manage for a summer camp, we have a dozen or so remote locations around camp which are connected via BiDi fiber. At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, the only active equipment at these sites will be a single Wi-Fi access point. Currently at each location, the BiDi fiber is terminated in an SPF in an 8-port Cisco switch. The AP is then uplinked to and is powered by the switch. 
 These switches are well past their expected life and I will be replacing them before they start failing. 
 Since we don’t need all of the extra switch ports, I have been looking for a media converter that has an SFP cage as well as that can provide PoE out on its copper port (for the AP). These have been impossible to locate thus far.
 Does this device exist?
 I know I can get a low port count switch with PoE out and an SFP cage from Mikrotik and likely others, and I’ll likely go down that road if needed. I was hoping to avoid the extra configuration with those, though.
 Thanks for any pointers!

I am not saying he was unhealthy or had bad habits but it seems in our industry we worry more about our networks and users then we do about our own health.

                              <span>Our company wants to dump terabytes of data into googles bard, entire file server files. The goal is to have real time company data points, mostly finance. It’s all random files and encrypted spreadsheets. Has anyone else seen this request, we are very skeptical but behind a black box both how it will work and any legal agreements.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t usually troubleshoot end user stuff like this but it somehow made it up to me and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on... When you enter a certain user&#x27;s email address into the To field of your outlook client, a message appears saying the mailbox is not monitored and to use a different address blah blah blah. It looks just like an automatic reply / out of office message you&#x27;d turn on if you&#x27;re out. The problem is, I have no idea where it&#x27;s coming from. Help desk looked at her client and said there&#x27;s no auto reply turned on and ran a repair on office before escalating to me. I looked over EAC and there are no forwards set up, no auto reply, no transport rules. Where could this be coming from?

 First, the guy wants to promote the server to a DC as it &quot;makes the install easier&quot;. Next, he tries to install Mcaffee antivirus on it, on top of our anti-virus solution. Now I just got an email from him, he wants us to disable our password requirements as &quot;they like to use simple passwords&quot;.
 When we said no, he complains that &quot;everyone else always gives us domain admin rights so we can do anything we need to do&quot;. What planet is this guy from?

Way back in the days, around 2005ish I saw a Microsoft partner demoing hosting conference calls and calling other people using a software very similar to Skype. I thought it looks interesting, but I just don&#x27;t see anyone using this in a corporate environment. Everyone has a Cisco phone at their desk.
 Well I was completely wrong.

 Why do I keep seeing people use Caps Lock to type in their passwords? I don&#x27;t know how many times I day I see it happening. These are usually the same people that end up locking themselves out of their account because they mistakenly left it on.
 I&#x27;m talking about:
  
Caps Lock on, type 1 letter, CL off, 1 letter, CL on, 1 letter, CL off, 4 letters, etc.
  
I see you using Shift all the time, do you think it doesn&#x27;t work on passwords?

                              <span>Title is really it. I have been running Proxmox for our corporate lab for about 2 years now and have loved it all around. There are some nuances of course, and it is very easy to break. Also stuck vm&#x27;s can be a pain to bring back online but that can be solved with good SOP&#x27;s and lack of fear of the linux CLI
 Has anyone had good results running production systems with this hypervisor? Any feedback on their paid support packages?
 I would love to have a 3rd option, getting really tired of Hyper-v issues and VMWare&#x27;s subscription balooning of costs...

 My IT Director is asking for ideas to better secure our infrastructure. An idea was to have system administrators work from jumpboxes, VMs, when needing to access AD, network configuration, etc, instead of accessing those resources directly from our work stations. Can anyone give recommendations on how to best implement this or give insight if you are currently doing something like this?

                              <span>Hi,
 I released version 1.5.1 of mxcheck. mxcheck is a little helper that checks e-mail servers for correct DNS entries, certificates, information leaks and if the e-mail server is an open relay. It is a command line tool and open source.
 Happy if it helps you.
 https://github.com/steffenfritz/mxcheck
 As always, if you find a bug or have a feature idea, let me know.
 p.s.: I posted for older version here before, so please don&#x27;t ask for docker, web user interface or why you should use this and not another solution. I create this in my sparetime to get my work done and I am happily sharing it. If you use something different, it is absolutely ok. &lt;3

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 We have a problem I hope maybe someone here has some knowledge or help us. We want to use some smartcard to authenticate on machines.We&#x27;ve bought already 4 different Smart Card Reader / Writer. We also already bought 2 different Cards. But still doesn&#x27;t work under Linux/Mac/Win. Under linux I get using pcsc_scan that card is unresponsive.
 When I try the following command with a Bank card opensc-tool -r0 -a 3b:ff:13:00:... with the cards we bought I get nothing the reply is empty.
 Before even jumping to the authentication part I would like to write them. I need help with this and maybe the cards I bought are bad ? 
 What we bought : - Cards with Yaron Gtech SLE4428 with HiCo Magnetic Stripe PVC - Cards with SLE4442 - Reader ACS ACR39U-UF - Reader Techly CAM-USB2TY Compact/Writer - Reader USB Smart Card Reader, Rocketek DOD Military USB - Reader Thales 
 Thanks a lot for any help Best

                              <span>Hi all
 Recently one of our &quot;VIP&quot; users had the problem that his desktop icons get moved around when he changes workplace (WOH or Laptop). Maybe an important to note, is that he has 3 displays and connects to a VM through a software client on his worklaptop (connected via dockingstation).
 I saw if you disable all the &quot;move automatically&quot; and grid settings, then it shouldn&#x27;t move everything around or &quot;memorize&quot; where what was, even when switching between mono or multi displays setups.
 I tested it on my setup and it didn&#x27;t seem so consistent with &quot;memorizing&quot; where I set the icons. Has anyone had any similar experience or what do you guys use? If anything.
 P.S: Yes, it is very important on which screen what icon is placed...

For my personal laptop I am okay with installing additional software if needed or if it will enhance the connection somehow. For my work PC, I am unable to install any software, which is why I am needing to access it via a web browser. What solution does VMware have to do this or is there a better way to do this?

We have separate SSIDs for BYOD devices and corporate owned devices, and the BYOD devices are on a completely different subnet and different VLAN.
 The Meraki system is configured for WPA2-Enterprise 802.1X connections using the user&#x27;s AD username and password to authenticate with the NPS RADIUS server. It&#x27;s also set up to forward RADIUS accounting packets to NPS which is then configured to forward them on to the firewall, so the firewall can associate BYOD IPs with users and apply rules and policies accordingly. 802.11r and 802.11w are both turned off. Mandatory DHCP is turned off. RADIUS server timeout and EAP timeout are both set to 10 seconds. It&#x27;s confi…</span>

 &quot;The Key Distribution Center (KDC) encountered aticket-granting-ticket (TGT) from another KDC (login.microsoftonline.com) that did not contain aPAC attributes field. &quot;
 We are in a hybrid environment so I think this is linked but I can&#x27;t find how to fix that.
 Anyone have info ?

                              <span>I was wondering how others handle sharing with anyone in org settings. I noticed some documents need to be shared that way, but I have found a several that students can see and should not have any access to them too. (I fear there may be a lot) I imagine that is fine if everyone in org is an employee. But since we are a university, we have students in our same org. Are other schools just using different email addresses for students?
 thanks!

 I found a great comment by u/LudwikTR
  
I feel like most people in the comments are not understanding the mechanism that makes this potentially problematic. I will admit that the author of the website, focusing primarily on his disdain for a particular corporation, doesn&#x27;t help clarify the point.
 A significant amount of software automatically converts parts of text that appear to be URLs (even without an explicit protocol) into clickable links. These include mail clients, messengers, internet forums, social media sites, CMS systems, text editors, etc.
 Until now, such software would convert hello.com into a clickable link (since .com is a valid TLD) but would leave hello.zip as is (since .zip wasn&#x27;t one).…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I have an integration of FreeRADIUS and LDAP running on IPA server. it works well but the FreeRADIUS config requires a user that can read LDAP and for this a password has to be stored in cleartext. 
 Is there a way to achieve the Radius -&gt; LDAP authentication without storing a users&#x27; password in cleartext on the RADIUS server?

                              <span>Lets say i have a virtual Fileserver. The Data of the Fileserver is on a iscsi storage (LUN/Datastore). This should be Block storage ?
 Now many other vms Connect to the Fileserver to get Access to the Data. That should be File Storage, right?
 Is that correct? Thanks for Help.

                              <span>I am running a game studio where we need access to our source control and license servers remotely. 
 What kind of remote access solution should i use? I think something along the lines of VPN, and most likely something Cisco (we are running as much Cisco as possible)? And are there other things i should think about- maybe a firewall?

 Any reccomendations?

 &quot;oh where that screen went that I borrowed, no idea I changed sites few weeks ago and didn&#x27;t take it with me&quot; 
 And this goes for screens, 4G-Modems, printers, TV&#x27;s..
 Almost anything they can borrow they lose. 
 We saw a GPS-tracker solution but that was the size of a brick ánd expensive for an asset worth €150 
 In an ideal world, i&#x27;d be looking for a bluetooth low energy tag, that we can put software on our windows clients to scan for (or they can send us their location ofcourse).
 https://www.wiliot.com/ looks interesting but isn&#x27;t in production yet. 
 Spent some time googling but can&#x27;t find a solid solution so looking for any input!

                              <span>Odd technology bingo question. Using a DFS share to present user profile and Office ODFC volumes to our VDI users using FSLogix. Mostly working fine and dandy, but seeing issues occasionally post and during VHD mount that appear to relate to VSS writers timing out.
 Basically around the time we&#x27;ve had reported issues, i can see errors in the DFS server logs relating to VSS. In application logs:
 EventID 12298 (VSS)
 Volume Shadow Copy Service error: The I/O writes cannot be held during the shadow copy creation period on volume \\?\Volume{fed84df2-6fdf-466b-9ce9-9e3671b67ba8}\. The volume index in the shadow copy set is 0. Error details: Open[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ], Flush[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ], Release[0x80042314, The shadow copy provider timed out while holding writes to the volume being shadow copied. This is probably due to excessive activity on the volume by an application or a system service. Try again later when activity on the volume is reduced.
 ], OnRun[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ].
 Operation:
 Executing Asynchronous Operation
 Context:
 Current State: DoSnapshotSet
 ​
 System Logs:
 event id 8 (Volsnap)
 The flush and hold writes operation on volume X: timed out while waiting for a release writes command.
 I don&#x27;t have VSS enabled on the volume, no backup application running at the time etc. I&#x27;m assuming DFS doesn&#x27;t rely on the VSS service to perform it&#x27;s replication to other member servers?, if so can i disable the service on the basis no shadows configured on the volume and no backup apps rely on the service?

                              <span>Today, all CIS Benchmarks have at least 2 profiles defined as follows:
 Level 1 - Items in this profile intend to:
  
Be practical and prudent
 Provide a clear security benefit
 Not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means
  
Level 2 - This profile extends the &quot;Level 1&quot; profile. Items in this profile exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:
  
Are intended for environments or use cases where security is paramount
 Acts as defense in depth measure
 May negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology
  
The questions are:
  
What Level do you typically use?
 Do you use the above criteria to determine which Level to use?
 Do you have a different criteria, if so what is it?
  
All feedback will be greatly appreciated.
 CIS is a community-driven nonprofit responsible for industry leading best practices for securing IT systems and data. The CIS Benchmarks are computer system configuration guidance standards that are used world-wide to secure systems ranging from handheld devices to workstations to servers to network devices.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bit of a long term employee - 15 years in the current Senior Sysadmin role in education in East coast Australia. Today two L1s and I got the email offering to have the redundancy discussion. A bit strange since we are the only non-MSP staff and the key source of site knowledge. I&#x27;m approaching 50 and the main household earner and there is some well founded trepidation... but strangely after the hard years of Covid lockdowns and short staffing I find myself thinking that this is is an opportunity and not a curse. Any tips for those who have been in this position are welcome.

 ​
 I have a little problem regarding SMTP on a windows server 2012 r2. Running in IIS 6.0.
 Current sessions are very long meaning that for exemple scan-to-mail takes a long time. Ill see about 150 seconds before session is ended and the mail has been sent.
 Feels like an quit command cant be recived from printer or from smtp server.
 Our firewall was also updated regard firmware.
 If i terminate an session in smtp, the mail is sent right away.
 An manual quit command kind of.
 ​
 Any idé what it could be?
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey folks, We’re doing some tests with OCFS2 for creating an active passive setup across two regions.
 In the current setup, we have two DCs, dc01 and dc02. VMs vm01 and vm02 share an ocfs2 fs. The shared virtual disk resides on a dedicated lun that is replicated to the remote site. vm03 and vm04 are in dc02 with ocfs2 setup with the same cluster name. For failover the vms in dc01 are shutdown, the lun is switched to rw mode in dc02, virtual disks are mounted in vm03/04 and then ocfs2 is mounted. This is working as expected but involves tasks at the san level.
 I was reading about drdb and was wondering if we can use it to replicate the ocfs2 in dc01 over wan to dc02. In this approach we’ll just use independent virtual disks and not use the san based replication.
 But is this even possible? Should we setup drdb between vm01 and vm03 or is my understanding not correct?

                              <span>I manage a bunch of Ubuntu servers with Apache and Nginx web servers on them, but we also have a tomcat server running a java webapp, and I am not that familiar with tomcat.
 I have renewed an Let&#x27;s Encrypt SSL certificate (fullchain.pem and privkey.pem) that I want to deploy to the tomcat web server.
 I am looking at the server.xml file, but I am not 100% sure how to proceed.
 I see different SSL &quot;connectors&quot; like NIO and APR/native. I don&#x27;t know the difference. Which one should I use and why?
 The config points to three files: certificateKeyFile, certificateFile and certificateChainFile.
 ​
 Is the below approach correctly understood?
 ​
 certificateKeyFile is the privkey.pem file
 certificateChainFile is the fullchain.pem file
 But what should I put in certificateFile?

 How do you guys reduce the attack surface while reducing the impact to user experience and your IT service desk?

Before number matching, they could approve the request on their phones without any issue, but now they obviously need to enter the number to confirm. How can this be solved? By setting a different auth method for those accounts only? Or... ?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 after reading the SMTP-RFC I&#x27;m unsure how an (the average?) SMTP server will act when a first delivery to another mail server fails:
 Let&#x27;s say example.com has one MX record mail.example.com. mail.example.com is unreachable and a remote SMTP delivery fails because of it.
 Before the remote SMTP server tries another delivery, the A record mail.example.com is updated to point to a failover server. Will remote SMTP servers re-resolve the hostname mail.example.com on the second delivery attempt or will they use the IP address they received the first failure from?
 I could test this, but I would be interested in real-life experience as I&#x27;m sure different mail server software will behave differently if this is not RFC-mandated.

 Long time lurker, first time poster.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve recently been tasked with creating/implementing a ticketing system (I&#x27;m a new Apprentice IT Technician) for our Team of 2 (within the Education Industry) and would love to know what ticketing system everyone uses. I know that it&#x27;s possible to use google forms and export this to a google sheet/excel document. But ideally I&#x27;d love something that I can make reports on and export into csv files. 
 We have roughly 1000 users so being able to select a priority and categorising the calls would be an amazing feature. Ideally I&#x27;d love for a free solution but honestly please drop any/all suggestions and I will see what is cost effective for us.

                              <span>Used to use WDS and PXE booting to deploy my Windows 10 image on new laptops, built the image in a way that I could boot the machine, it would display a screen asking for language, i insert a USB provisioning package from azure and from there my image is completed.
 I can&#x27;t seem to find a straight answer for deploying Windows 11 however. I can install my applications fine, but struggle to capture the image using MDT. I have read that a lot of people experience issues with MDT. I am thinking - there&#x27;s got to be a straightforward way of doing this that I am missing when reading Microsoft docs, etc.
 What is the standard method for deploying Windows 11 Azure joined machines? Or what is your preferred method? Any help is massively appreciated.

 Today, I had to use the break glass account and when I logged in, I was promted to go through the MFA setup (microsoft authenticaor app). I did this and gained access to the account but now I&#x27;m stuck with MFA on the account.
 I&#x27;ve check all my CA policies and the account is excluded from them, I haven&#x27;t changed any settings in the admin panel for months so I can&#x27;t see why the account would suddenly be required to have MFA set up.
 Any ideas where I can look? other places where this type of thing is set?

                              <span>We are looking to &#x27;propperly&#x27; buildout our PKI, and we&#x27;re looking for documentation to use as a Design basis. Of course we have the &#x27;AD CS bible&#x27; (Windows Server 2008 PKI and Cert Security), and are familiar with the common practices (offline roots, HSMs etc). 
 The problem for us is... how far should we go if we don&#x27;t have external requirements?
 We aren&#x27;t trying to get trusted by the CA/Browser forum, as far as I know there are no industry cert &#x27;bridges&#x27; we are intersted in, we don&#x27;t fall under PCI or HIPPA or any specific compliance standard. Theres ISO 27099 as a general aplicabaility standard but its not very prescriptive of the implementaiton, only the &#x27;paperwork&#x27; assocaited with it. 
 When proposing options (i.e windows cert store vs yubi HSM, vs Thales HSMs) with tens of thousands of dollars difference, for an area of our infra not well understood by the non technical folks, what justification can I give other than &quot;more money more betterer&quot; to guide the discussions.

                              <span>Hello Caffeine Addicts,
 I´ve come to ask for help. I am working on setting up FOG Project (client imaging system).
 I am an apprentice and got this as a project. I have setup a new VM with Debian that runs FOG and I have provided fog with the dhcp servers ip address. DHCP works and the client can pull the filename, size and ip address. However, it shuts off shortly after the ipxe screen with error message &quot;DHCP error&quot;. I´ve attached a screenshot and I´ve read countless websites and community posts.

                              <span>Not sure how many Nutanix admins we have here, but in my environment we applied the DBX files as mentioned in ADV200011 and Microsoft guidance for applying Secure Boot DBX update (KB4575994).
 Every month after applying Windows Updates all the servers which have had the DBX files applied suddenly become vulnerable to BootHole again and Nessus starts flagging them with:
 The Windows Secure Boot forbidden signature database (DBX) did not contain the expected certificates. When performing DBX updates exactly as illustrated in the vendor documentation, it is important to note that you are applying only the latest update. Updates applied in this manner may only appended to the DB, so you may still need to apply the older updates from the &quot;Archive of Prior Versions of DBX Files&quot; linked in the UEFI Revocation List File document (linked in the See Also advisory). Please refer to the vendor advisory for more information. 
 Nutanix supposedly fixed the issue in a update to Foundation (4.5.4.2 - Nutanix Account may be required)
 For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been pushing this out to all the Virtuals on the Nutanix cluster from PDQ (which only temporarily fixes):
 Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\apr2021\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\apr2021\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\aug2022\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\aug2022\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\sep2022\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\sep2022\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite 
 I&#x27;ve logged two calls with Nutanix, and the outcome is because its a Windows VM it can&#x27;t be a Nutanix issue so contact Microsoft.
 Other than contacting Microsoft, does anyone know how we could resolve this?

                              <span>Hello,
 My organization is looking for a cost-effective MDM solution that is suitable for our environment and our requirements. The primary objectives are to manage BYOD (mainly mobile devices with Andoird, iOS operating systems) and a few corporate mobile devices if applicable, such as controlling the number of mobile devices per user, secure access (requiring devices to be password-protected, data to be wiped in case of theft or compromise). 
 Currently, we do not use Microsoft Office but Google Workspace (G-Suite) with Enterprise Starter license. As with this license, we can enable basic features of mobile device management, like enabling passcode, wiping data. On the other hand, we wish to limit the number of authorized/registered mobile devices (BYOD), and also want to improve some optional features, such as blocking insecure devices (jailbreak or rooted devices, unsupported/legacy devices), requiring anti-malware protection, requiring device encryption, automatically removing devices that haven&#x27;t check in for 30 days.
 We have narrowed down the list of vendors to Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management), ScaleFusion, Miradore. Some of the solution providers that are ruled out include Microsoft Intune (I love it but we are using Google Workspace), JumpCloud (Anroid devices not supported), SimpleMDM &amp; Mosyle (only iOS devices supported). I personally prefer Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management) given the fact that our ecosystem is based on it (we will not have to invest more time or resources to another solution) and our security requirements are just fundamental.
 Given that, can you share your feedback or experience in this matter? Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated!

 How do I block certain websites on an individual machine but on all browsers installed on that machine? I tried router settings but they never seem to work. 
 Some employees waste a lot of time ever since I repaired their laptops and took away their new machines for further allotment in other departments at my organisation.
 Edit: Is there a way within Windows itself? Don&#x27;t really want to go for paid solutions as of now.. 
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am trying to allow standard users to run ViPlex Express (LED signage software) on our RDS server.
 Everytime ViPlex Express is launched the user is prompted for UAC as the software is from an unknown publisher.
 So far I have tried granting &quot;everyone&quot; FULL access to the bin directory in the install directory.
 I have tried creating a scheduled task icon which only works for myself.
 I have tried running Standard User Analyzer which doesn&#x27;t detect any issues.
 I have tried running Application Compatibility Toolkit and making a shim but that doesn&#x27;t work.
 I have reached out to the developer to see if they have a signed copy of ViPlex Express but I will not be holding my breath on getting a positive outcome from that enquiry.
 I would rather not disable UAC or make the user and admin but I do need some way for them to run this software. How do others run unsigned software for standard users?

                              <span>Just graduated a vocational school for IT, about to graduate highschool this Sunday (hooray). And I’m trying to pursue a career in IT. I’ve got 3 Optiplex minis, an l3 juniper switch, and pfsense as my router and at least for the Optiplex cluster I’m trying to simulate an enterprise IT as best as I can just to get experience and say that I am familiar with those aspects for jobs. So far I have a domain controller and a backup, dhcp server. I plan on adding a file, printer, and vpn server as well. I’m looking for real sysadmin experience on this and if anybody would like to give insight on things I should add/drop? Thank you all I really appreciate it!

                              <span>I understand that IGMPv3 allow two servers to use the dance multicast address to send data to subscribers/receivers. I understand this is accomplished by allowing the receiver to specify a physical source address when requesting to join a multicast group. My question is why would someone design a topology that way. Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to just use a different multicast address for different data. 
 I read that it could lead to reduced bandwidth by using a single multicast to send different data. I can&#x27;t visualize how the bandwidth demand would be any different.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been preparing for the Cisco ENCOR exam lately and I&#x27;ve noticed something quite surprising. The exam includes quite a bit of content on tools like the DNA Center, Firepower features, WSA, and ESA.
 While these are undoubtedly advanced and powerful tools, it seems to me that they&#x27;re not widely used in a lot of real-world enterprise networks. Many companies, especially smaller ones, don&#x27;t use these specific tools in their daily operations.
 So, I&#x27;m wondering, shouldn&#x27;t the ENCOR exam focus more on technologies and skills that are more universally applicable in today&#x27;s networking world?

 If using a layer 3 switch and the switchports connected to the end hosts are layer 3, will ARP messages update the cam table or the ARP table or both? I know its both if using SVIs for routing, unsure about this one.

                              <span>Not sure if this is a question for this sub, but ill give it a try nonetheless.
 so I have a network at my office where the nas has our file, and everyone through the nas can access the file and log on and make amends and whatnot. recently im looking to get another office opened in another country and I want to make it possible for people in other countries to access my local (main) network so they can also open that file from the nas and make amends.
 if the file was on the other location this would cause a problem as there will now be 2 files and then if someone for remote cant sees the local changes and vice versa.
 with some research, I&#x27;ve seen that maybe a Site-to-Site Vpn would work for this and would allow my remote devices to act as if they are on the local network. I&#x27;ve seen a firewall box called the merwaki go GX50 which apparently has the Site to site VPN function, so im here to ask would this work and is there any other solutions that i can deploy or better suited for this use case.

                              <span>My knowledge of this is very partial, I hope this is the right place to ask.
 Some months ago I started paying an extra to my ISP in order to have a static IP, which I think it entails not being behind a Carrier-grade NAT.
 I see that my router is choosing 100.64.0.83 and 100.64.0.84 as DNS servers. Under my understanding, DNS servers are &quot;external/public machines&quot;, for instance 8.8.8.8 belongs to Google. But looking up 100.64.0.83, it seems like it&#x27;s a &quot;shared address space&quot;, which seems to be like the 192.168.0.xx, part of a private network. But I don&#x27;t t hink it&#x27;s not part of my private network (the ping is higher). Am I actually behind a CGN or am I misunderstanding something?

                              <span>I will have the following:
  
1 Windows Server 2019 PC where GPMC is controlled [DC] (192.168.4.10)
 1 Windows 11 PC to access the PC above to modify GPMC (192.168.4.99)
 10 PC Clients (192.168.4.150 [-159])
 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
 Default Gateway: 192.168.4.2
 Primary DNS: 192.168.4.10
  
The idea is for the clients to access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 station, as I plan on doing some sort of filtering. That is, if a client attempts to access a blocked site, they will see a site unavailable page that I will re-direct them to.
 I was thinking to have them access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 PC, but I&#x27;ve also been told that I should set up another server strictly for RRAS, which I&#x27;m very new to, as well.
 I also want to install software from GPMC. For that, I will need a shared folder somewhere on my network that my clients can access, without allowing access to my network settings or GPMC.
 My question: Please show me a network drawing of how I should go about this setup. There will be two users in my active directory: MyAdmin and MyUser. All 10 clients will connect using MyUser. The PC used to access GPMC will use MyAdmin.
 What (if any) PCs should I add to this network and what function would they serve? If I add more PCs, who handles acting like a router? File Server (for installations)? As I&#x27;m trying to do that all on the DC but I hear that&#x27;s not good practice.

 They&#x27;ve got about 3 blocks of buildings that encompass the local area complex. (as well as two remote locations connected via ipsec tunnel)
 The local buildings are mostly like warehouses where production work is being done with some office spaces for desk type workers. 
 A main building where main data etc feed drops and a main server exists. (nothing like a noc etc you may commonly find in a standard office building) 
 Most equipment and their operating systems are overdue for an upgrade (have already reached end of support/life or just about to) 
 They&#x27;ve got a main switch off the main server rack.. This switch feeds some smaller additional swi…</span>

 I’ve posted a while to find something for reporting etc and I think I’ve landed on NTOP as they seem to have solved the VPN issue I would be bound to experience with Zabbix.
 Scenario: We have a few installations with jump boxes installed for our audio visual installations that we managed across Australia.
 Wanting to find something simple that wasn’t subscription based that I could host at the office to get all that data back.
 I haven’t done a demo yet but wondering if anything had any NTOP experience and if so, anything missing, anything you don’t like?

                              <span>We&#x27;re serving an L2TP VPN for our users. Some experience timeouts of some requests to an internal webserver. This scenario is
  
user is on a home internet connection
 
vpn is established
 
packets to the webserver are routed through the vpn
 
dns resolution through vpn works
 
login page of the webserver may load or timeout depending on luck
 
using another internet connection solves the issue
 
 I&#x27;m guessing there is something special about l2tp I don&#x27;t understand, that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m posting here. It looks like the some home routers are messing with some encrypted packets. How? I haven&#x27;t seen behaviour like this ever before.

 I&#x27;m looking for a management systems for domain registrars. (Paid or open source) I&#x27;m talking about web applications that can manage the registration/transfer of domain names and that lets a user handle DNS records for a domain name. I would like too that this web applications has the possibility of sending/exporting cost reports for each user.
 Thanks in advance

 I&#x27;m new around these parts only just landing my first jr admin role very recently.
 Would anyone have any recommendations on what resources to use to learn how vulnerabilities and security works?
 I&#x27;m looking for basics right up to advanced as i&#x27;d like to learning everything as i go 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello,
 running Debian bookworm and a Windows Server 2022 PDC. Be careful, it will be a lengthy post.
 The Windows PDC&#x27;s DNS is configured to only accept secure updates.
 So Debian is domain-joined by using realmd. SSSD is installed with all dependecies &#x27;realm discover&#x27; lists (including sssd-ad) in version 2.8.2.
 realm join -v EXAMPLE.COM 
 I provide the neccessary credentials and realm authenticates against the domain controller from EXAMPLE.COM .
 &#x27;klist&#x27; lists correctly the cached krb5 ticket from the account which was used to join. The PDC acts also as DNS Server if I look after &quot;debian.example.com&quot;, all &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;AAAA&#x27; entries are added.
 The default sssd.conf looks like this:
 [sssd] domains &#x3D; Example.com config_file_version &#x3D; 2 services &#x3D; nss, pam services &#x3D; nss, pam ad_hostname &#x3D; d…</span>

                              <span>Hey Everyone. I apologize for the long post. when writing posts i have the habit of trying to give as much context as possible to the point of going overboard.
 I have many years experience as a tech doing breakfix as an authorized service provider on all sorts of computers including every vender I can think of for their desktops, laptops, workstations, and tower servers. I did that for 7 years in a small but super busy computer repair shop where i learned fundamentals of working with customers but more important to the topic of this thread, I learned how to fix and build almost every type and style and size of desktop with the exception of rackmounted servers. I never did outcall service calls at that job (it was someone elses job to go onsite where it was my job to man the shop)
 I quit …</span>

                              <span>Trying to get my head around these two services while working with a Hybrid setup of onsite and Azure AD. I understand and get the syncing of the users but how does Intune vary from normal GPOs. 
 Do they do the same or they different tasks? 
 Can you have users/devices managed by both or is intune more of for devices on the go?
 Example, deploying defender for end point is it better do via Intune and skip using GPOs altogether?

 I work for a small company so it will only be for a few desktops to begin with. I have local resources that users will need access to. So as I see it right now I have two choices.....
  
 I can provision the VDI on my network, but where is the best place to put it? Do I need an isolated server etc. for security?
 I would preferably like to use Azure but I am not sure if I can or how well it will work with my local resources.

Microsoft starts throttling and then blocking email from unsecure versions of Exchange starting with 2007 and moving on to newer vulnerable versions. I do0 NOT see a start date, but NOW is the time for a &quot;come to Jesus moment&quot; to upgrade/or migrate vulnerable servers ASAP!

Web links in Outlook for Windows open side-by-side with email in Microsoft Edge. See

 I would consider Red Hat too, but is literally too expensive and out of the equation.
 Plus, I would like to gain a good understanding of Linux system, not deep dive into it and be an expert at it.

 I have tried other devices and other browsers with the same issue. And it&#x27;s just my website. So this isn&#x27;t a internet or chrome or web browser issue I don&#x27;t think.
 I&#x27;m guessing something went wrong with my website. Maybe I got hacked? I got a really weird email saying &quot;42 - ( ) &quot; that said it was sent from myself via my website, around the time my website went down.
 How can I fix this when I can&#x27;t even access the control panel of my website? (since I need to go to my website to access the Wordpress dashboard)

                              <span>I just started working it for this company 3 weeks ago and we’ve got some problems way over my head. The boss man new this going in but I’m in school and he’s helping me OJT this stuff. 
 Our current conundrum is twofold. I need to build a server that can house a MySQL server VM database that any one or two or three of 10 people can access at any given time, as well as run a file sharing VM to access a few network mapped drives. I’ve been looking servers with 2x xenon e5-2699 v3s, would that be enough processing power? 128gb ram and probably 8x 1tb SSDs. 
 More importantly at the moment, we just tried switching ISPs for gigabit speeds and learned the hard way that comcast blocks port 445 and will not unblock it no matter what. And we use 445 for our current Azure file shares SMB network mapped drives. Is there a good work around for the mean time while I get this new server built? Our MSP wants $4k to build an Azure VPN to tunnel the file shares but that’s a little absurd. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all, Im trying to use the Remote desktop software to login into a second user account Ive created on my home pc. 
 Basically, I just want another instance of windows to multi-box something, but other software as VMware and Virtualbox dont work. I know other people that use RDP for the reason I want to use it for too, so thats why Im deciding to use it, however none of them ran into the problem im having.
 Ive created 2 seperate Admin accounts on my PC, one with just a Name / pw, and the other with my microsoft email.
 I am using &quot;127.0.0.2&quot; to try and log into the either of the second users, and using the microsoft account one does not work for some reason, it says credentials are wrong. However I can use the other user that i named &quot;Test&quot; with a password i set.
 However upon loggin into that account, I am greeted by the error stated in the title. I have googled the issue and there are a ton of people also having similar problem, will some suggestions saying to add registry keys, or change some setttings in windows to change the limit of connections. I have done all of these but they have not worked.

 I&#x27;ve been struggling with this issue for a few hours and after hours of searching for solution I decided to ask for help here (I very rarely go ask to a forum). It appears that uwsgi cannot bind to /run/uwsgi due to it being a read-only filesystem. When I try to set the location elsewhere it results in the same thing. Does anyone know what to do with this?

 I read that many hate rhel, other hate Ubuntu and Canonical, other that hate what happened to centos..and many other. Many of this probably came from casual users or not techical user. 
 What think sysadmin about this 2 distros?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Title says it all. Our leadership is considering pulling the plug on MECM and moving us to BigFix. 
 Any insider tips? Opinions? Technically they seem comparable. Going through the demo process now. Anything to watch out for?
 We mainly use MECM currently to issue patching, WinOS upgrades, and app deployments; our Macs currently on JAMF, and our Linux are unmanaged. 
 Our scope on BF would be all our 15,000 servers/workstations/laptops covering all OS types Win/MacOS/Linux. At this time MDM would not be included and our Android/iOS will be staying on MobileIron core at this time.

 Junior support engineer here.
 Part of my goals for the year are writing end user instructions for the business.
 This can range from devs to your usual corporate roles (HR, fiance etc) 
 Do you have any suggestions on what I should write about apart from the obvious.
 Any and all suggestions welcome.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am posting this question to the community as I am looking for some suggestions, helpful guides which can help me implementing the design to achieve the below scenario:
 Scenario: We have to automate the application onboarding for OIDC/SAML app. hosted in secure auth to ForgeRock.
 Design: Similar to any IAC tool where we declare the desired state using a yaml file, the same conecpt is said to be utilized. We would have a yaml file defining application details. Going through terraform registry, I found that there is no such provider defined for oidc/saml app onboarding by ForgeRock. Also, if we define a plugin for same we are restricted by the programming language (need to use Go for development). So, we need a kind of python script which can function similar to a provider in Terraform, reading through the desired application configuration from the yaml file and then making use of the rest api endpoint exposed by ForgeRock for creating the app.
 Can anyone in the community please help me out here with any useful resources like any Github repo&#x27;s ,opensource project, docs which I can make use of to give me a starting point about how this can be implemented?

                              <span>Hi everybody, 
 Last week my company decided they want to set up three TVs in the production facility which only purpose will be to show on all screens the same web page. This TVs have Android and Chromecast built-in and will be connected over Wifi. I have already set up an hidden SSID with a separate VLAN with only guest access (they can&#x27;t reach any service or server aside from the ones I decide to). I have also set up a Windows 10 VM to try casting via Google Chrome and it works fine. The issue is that this setup takes a lot of resources from the VM and sometimes the image on the TVs gets &quot;blurry&quot; when it&#x27;s still for a few mins. The question is: is there a better way to do what I&#x27;m doing? I can&#x27;t find any viable desktop software that lets me cast to multiple devices. 
 Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t use any additional wiring because the distances will be too high. The only thing we could improve would be to connect the TVs via Ethernet. 
 Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions!

 Any ideas??? (btw, the ports that do work have entire internet connectivity and it&#x27;s 1ghps and working fine, so I don&#x27;t see how it could be a nat issue.)

 AD-Bridging was selected through a discussion and evaluation process (before my time) of the additional functionality over SSSD to try and address general IAM issues with a Linux estate of 3/4K systems. Currently all local accounts, all a complete mess, an audit nightmare.
 We&#x27;ve bought Delinea/Centrify Server Suite after it came out top during an RFP process including our PAM tooling.

 I was wondering if you could recommend any applications that have free editions or trials? It would be great to test them out and see how they work in practice. Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>If a user told you this what would you do? 
 Would some authenticator apps have logs on their phone to look at? 
 For example:
 Microsoft authenticator just left a notification to on the phone to “approve sign in” and 1 hour later when user clicked the notice it just glitches out with a time out error message
 So no way to know which account triggered it?
 What steps would you do if it happened? And what are some logical possibility, (ie, the mail app on iPhone trying to login with cached credentials.) to tell the user so they don’t like freak out.

 I have a technical interview for a Sr. Linux Systems Administrators on Wednesday. I’ve heard that other failed candidates have been too ‘junior’.
 What in particular would you expect to come up on a Sr. Linux Admin technical interview?
 I think I’m at a senior level, but this has me nervous 😋
 Things I’m comfortable with:
  
Storage - Local and SAN. Various file systems. LVM. Monitoring disk space and disk performance/health 
 Upgrading systems and rolling back packages/kernels 
 Backups with various tools such as Veeam
 Compiling software with GCC/Make
 GIT
 NFS/Samba
 Monitoring tools such as Nagios/SolarWinds
 Networking/load balancing/firewalls/bonding 
 Active Directory/LDAP
 Bash/Python scripting 
 Ansible/Terraform
 Printing/cups
  
What am I missing that a senior should know how to do? 🙂
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙂

                              <span>Our firm uses VDI so that we access our workspace anywhere. The issue I&#x27;m faced with is that for some strange reason, I cannot hear any sound from within the VDI environment through my regular sound output; they only way I can listen to sound within the VDI is if I switch my sound to my monitor&#x27;s native speakers or plug in my headphones.
 I&#x27;ve searched all over the web for a solution and pretty much get the same note about installing a driver update, but after checking I have the latest.
 I&#x27;m running Windows 10 x64.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Running Windows system check.
 Running Windows sound check/fix
 Disabling the native speaker option/driver
 Rebooting the computer.
 Checking to make sure I have the lastest updates.
 Cursing at my tower.
 Going outside to get a burger then coming home and trying steps 1-6
  
Nothing seems to change; advice would be apreciated.

                              <span>I’ve tried updating the firmware. Changing various firmware settings. Different drives, different hard drive bays, different SSDs, windows 11, windows server 2022. No matter what I do if any drive other than the ssd is connected when the machine is booted - booting from the ssd won’t even be an available option for me. Automatically off the list. I will always end up in the EFI shell. 
 So at this point I’m only connecting the SSD and booting to windows server 2022 and running random-ish firmware and driver updates from the intel site. Their site/tool is recognizing the individual hardware but throwing some error about some thing like my hardware configuration - idk I’m away from the house right now but I imagine it’s because of my Frankenstein setup so it’s not able to recommend drivers and updates for me I’m kinda guessing and checking. 
 I’m not sure my professor is even supposed to be used with this board the, Xeon 1650 V4 @ 3.6 GHz; but they were being used together in a product I got this from. 
 I have 128 GB RAM and a second processor on the way just cause. The setup should theoretically work as it is though they were running Linux. 
 I wanted to get started with something I was familiar with (windows) but I suppose I can try a Linux distro in parallel if there are suggestions. Would really love to solve this tho for windows. Want a GUI on either.
 Thanks !

                              <span>Mine is VirtualBox. I&#x27;m currently using it for my IT classes and it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. I especially like how easy it is to set up a shared folder between the host and guest. 
 I&#x27;ve dabbled in Hyper-V a bit and there is definitely a learning learning curve. At least for me. 
 I have not touched VMware.

                              <span>Title says it all. We actually will retain a low-end firewall for some basic security and to manage redundant ISP uplinks. 
 We went serverless. It wasn&#x27;t even planned. Between going O365 and several other business critical apps migrating SaaS, when we looked to renew our on-prem server stack, it was real easy to just eliminate or migrate the remaining to PaaS/SaaS. 
 Part of that was moving to Azure AD and Intune/Defender, and then the more we looked at it, and with half our work force remote anyway, we felt we no longer needed on prem network security or a firewall. Just need internet. I feel we are more secure than before and it&#x27;s easier to manage and keep up with.
 Costs and workloads are relative yet shifted. I don&#x27;t even know if I am quite a sysadmin anymore. I have always had multiple roles, but not really a network admin for sure. But I keep busy. It has been stressful here in the middle of my career doing a complete upgrade in knowledge, and it was a crapton of work.

                              <span>Very soon, I will be meeting with HR and my director to present the subjects we should be covering under our Cyber policies.
 This includes things like:
  
 Email
  Internet Usage
  File Sharing
  USB access
  
However, I feel kind of lost, and unsure of how i’m supposed to cover EVERY topic, to not leave out anything etc. 
 I’m also unsure of the wording, does HR take care of that, and IT simply presents the subjects, and what we need legally covered?
 I have low expectations for someone writing the policy for us, and fully expect to be charged with doing this task.
 How did you come up with your operating policies?

 Anyone have any vendor recommendations ? So far we’ve looked at Drata, Vanta and Trustcloud (the later I wasn’t impressed with, first call could of been answered with an email, a second meeting for a demo and a required 3rd meeting to even get pricing is where I told them no thanks)
 Also who do you recommend for pen testing? We are a SaaS company that provides a LMS , and building a new Version of our product to be built around Soc out of the gate

                              <span>I am upgrading our ERP system this weekend. Rather, I should say I am coordinating between 3 different vendors upgrading our ERP system. In our non-production systems, the best timing I could get for the activity was about 15 hours. Then 2 hours for checkout. So I have been advertising a 18 hour outage to give me some slush time. Coming in a couple hours early would make everyone happy, and running over would be painful, so having a little extra fluff was great (AKA The Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott Engineering Rule).
 Cut to today. Had everything in place, management was frothing to get this going. They were all on the phone call for the official &#x27;Go&#x27; decision. Then the inexplicable happens. Total time needed to complete: 7 hours, including checkout. WTF? Am I happy the upgrade went smooth and finished with zero issues, yes? But, WTF?
 15 minutes after the note to the users that the system was ready, I got my first email from management wanting to know who was responsible for missing the target by 10 hours. Some of the overseas sites are upset because they rescheduled manufacturing and warehousing schedules based on my estimate. Now I have to spend the next week explaining why my vendors seemed to be &#x27;sandbagging&#x27; the non-prod systems and padding their numbers. Plus my credibility next time I go to ask for a production window is shot now.

                              <span>I work at a startup and business has started ramping up. We are now deploying about 100-200 windows 10 devices per week. Each device needs some software uploaded and settings changed. We have been using Ghost32 to image them. With unboxing, imaging, and licensing each device - each unit takes me about 7-10 minutes. 
 I think I am looking for something like Kubernetes or Puppet to help with orchestration. I have also read up of Chef and Ansible. Before I dive really deep into any of these, I wanted to see what you guys are using to accomplish this? Or is there a better way that I am not thinking of?

                              <span>I have been working as an IT support specialist for the past five months. Unfortunately, the IT department has been overlooked and not seen as an asset for the company&#x27;s growth, as they have been focusing on acquiring smaller businesses in recent years. The IT manager has experience with managed service providers and is skilled in project management, with previous knowledge of IT infrastructure. Therefore, the department is being managed by someone who is proficient in growing and documenting processes, as the company has a lack of documentation in general.
 My goal is to better manage the IT department and help it grow. I am interested in knowing the difference between an IT support specialist and a systems administrator and how I can develop my skills to become a future systems administrator for the company. I am eager to learn more about network administration, server management, and security management and pursue relevant certifications, such as Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), or CompTIA Security+. Additionally, I plan to work with my IT manager to develop and document IT processes and protocols, including standard operating procedures and user guides, to establish a strong foundation for the IT department.

                              <span>Having a bit of an issue…
 I’m working on getting a laptop on one of the specific WiFis on Unifi. Here’s the setup:
 NPS running on Windows Server 2022 std (running on Hyper-V) CA running on same server Self-signed cert in trusted store AD group for machines that will use RADIUS (only the one laptop, for testing) RADIUS client is set as UDM which manages 5 APs that the laptop can talk to Connection request policy also set to UDM IP Network policy grants access, is enabled, to Windows RADIUS group, NAS port type 802.11/ wireless Constraints set to auth method PEAP/EAP Cert for EAP set to NPS servers cert RADIUS standard attributes framed-protocol/PPP Unifi RADIUS profile created, shared secret the same for RADIUS client and Unifi profile, ports both set as 1812/1813 (auth/accounting)
 Trying to get the laptop to connect to network X tells me “checking network requirements”, “can’t connect” - does this when I’m running WPA3-Ent or WPA2-Ent, even WPA2- personal with passcode, enter passcode, checks network requirements, can’t connect.
 Any help would be appreciate!
 EDIT: also should note, there’s a duo auth proxy for the VPN that also uses this NPS, has an NPS client set as localhost

                              <span>We are trying to decide if per user or per device licenses will be the most economical for server CALs.
 Human employee count vs AD account count? What about service accounts? What about disabled accounts of former employees kept for retention history reasons?
 If you set up per-user licensing for server CALS and a worker has multiple dedicated accounts for specific tasks (daily user account, local admin account, server admin account, application admin account, domain admin account etc.), would each account in AD for each person need to be added to the license count for per-user licensing?

 We are currently in the process of implementing security solutions to effectively manage approximately 300 enterprise devices. These devices are primarily used within the corporate network. Students use personal machines (BYOD), including a mix of Windows and macOS. Currently, we have Fortigate firewalls with 2 redundant internet connections
 We use Azure AD as our main IDP. Our entire workforce relies solely on SaaS apps, we don&#x27;t have anything critical in our university on-prem
 For enterprise devices, we&#x27;re looking for full control, management, 802.1x authentication, and visibility.
 For Student BYOD devices (2000+) we&#x27;re looking for zero-trust access solutions for control and visibility when accessing SaaS apps. Students must have access within or outside the university network.
 We are looking into only cloud options.
 I&#x27;m looking for any tips or recommendations from people who have managed and secured a similar environment in the past. Any help is greatly appreciated.

 We have a task where an input file which is in yaml format with OIDC/Saml App configuration details(from secureAuth) has to be transformed to a xml metadata file or post request with key parameters for ForgeRock(or any other IDP) with the respective value retrieved from the yaml file, to create app configuration.
 Is there any such open source library or project which is currently shared with the community. We intend to design in similar way for this use case scenario as well.

                              <span>So we only have Office 365 E3 and we don&#x27;t have Conditional Access and right now we&#x27;re using the legacy MFA options and have push turned off to stop the risk of MFA fatigue.
 Microsoft say number matching is the default from 8th but when I enabled push in the legacy MFA settings section it didn&#x27;t always do number matching when I logged in to test.
 Sometimes it did number matching and sometimes it did a regular approve/reject push that was just with Outlook and the aka.ms/mfasetup logins.
 Is this normal?
 We&#x27;d like to use number matching and all the guides look like that&#x27;s now the default so I don&#x27;t get why it did a normal push.

                              <span>I am trying to access my web server I made on my local network, but I keep getting &quot;ERROR_CONNECTION_REFUSED&quot; whenever I try to access it. However - it works outside of my home network, i.e. my phone.
 I have tried all the basic troubleshooting steps like rebooting, clearing cache, flushing Windows DNS resolver cache, even gone as far as nuking my PC and re-installing Windows. It is absolutley baffeling.
 My web server is being hosted on a VM in TrueNAS Core, running Ubuntu Server 22.04.2 LTS, and all the usual other packages, i.e. Apache2, MySQL, etc etc. It is a fully functioning server, as I say I can access it from outside of my home network perfectly fine.
 I am not sure if it is the culprit, but I do have a Raspberry Pi on my network running Pi-hole. I have tried to whitelist my domain, disable it, change upstream DNS server between Google and Cloudflare, but to no avail. I&#x27;ve even tried removing it from the network all together.

                              <span>Hi everyone !!
 First I&#x27;m new in admin/network (student/1st y internship in admin) and I try my best to learn the fundamentals sorry if I ask dumb question !
 I have a thesis to do for my school year and my subject is about the implementation of RADIUS server and 802.1X for wired et wireless (via VPN too) connection to network.
 I have 3 questions :
 Is it possible to do a &quot;full&quot; virtualization of this infrastructure ? I want something like packet tracer do(or GNS3 but never used it before) to configure 802.1X on switch port, a windows server with NAPS-&gt;NPS fonctionnality, test wired and wireless login.
 I belive it&#x27;s possible to do 802.1X on packet tracer but for the windows server configuration ? It&#x27;s possible to create VM on packet tracer, or the &#x27;graphical&#x27; interface on the computers is enough ?
 2) Ok for local connection, what about VPN ? It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m learning on my own but never install/configure one from now, is it difficult to link with RADIUS ?
 3) For now I want to build my own classic RADIUS lab but I think I&#x27;m screwed to do it in entreprise... Because we have a hybrid/full cloud infrastructure in Azure AD. I think it&#x27;s a total another lvl of difficulty . Does anyone know more about this ?
 I&#x27;m not alone in my entreprise, we have a provider to take care of network tasks et management but he is not often there and I don&#x27;t dare to ask basic question :(
 I&#x27;m trying to be very proactive on the subject (it&#x27;s for october so it&#x27;s pretty soon I think), I will keep you up about this !
 Thanks

                              <span>This is postal: https://github.com/postalserver/postal
 It would do what I need, but I need a full API not (only) a web interface. 
 It has to be on-premises. No SaaS. 
 We currently use simple relays, but we can’t authenticate the mails and maintaining the IP whitelists is tedious and may not be feasible in the future.

 After 20 yrs with the same company(accounting firm), I terminated my employment and sought out a dream job in the Space industry. It was a long interview (4 weeks), but I accepted a position with a satellite launch company. I&#x27;m a space nerd and this is a dream job for me.
 So if you are looking for career advice, read the forum. I cherry-picked advice and found out what worked for me. So best of luck to everyone looking and another Thank You to everyone posting career advice.

 All devices have the latest iOS (16.4.1) if that helps and all have the ability to scan QR codes from the camera app.

                              <span>Note: the system this post refers to is on premise.
 I&#x27;m not a sysadmin, so I could be wrong about this, but it seems wrong to me that to RDP into the computers in the DMZ, I need to remember/maintain a local windows account for each computer in the DMZ (we have several dozen). These accounts&#x27; passwords also expire after a month, which makes managing the accounts even more difficult. I have searched the web for what is considered best practice, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything I can understand. I&#x27;ve seen a few posts about Read Only Domain Controllers and Jump Servers, but as a non sysadmin, I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding these.
 Now that you understand my question, let me give you a brief explanation of our system.
 The system is entirely on prem. At the front, we have a load balancer with a public IP. This is what our customers connect to. Behind the load balancer, we have the DMZ. The DMZ contains a number of windows server VMs running IIS. Behind the DMZ, we have our AD network. This is where our application and database server are. It&#x27;s also where the computers used by our staff are.
 As a user of the system, my computer is in the AD network. As I mentioned earlier, I sometimes need to RDP into a server in the DMZ. Ideally, I would just use my AD credentials to authenticate, but that doesn&#x27;t work because the DMZ is not part of the AD network.
 So, could you please tell me if the best way to connect to the servers in the DMZ is via local windows accounts? Another thing I&#x27;d like to know is, is a DMZ even necessary? Why can&#x27;t the load balancer just route to the appropriate computer in the AD network?

                              <span>So we have a major SaaS EMR vendor we use by clinical staff (healthcare org) contacting us demanding that if we want to continue receiving emailed daily patient reports from them, due to a &quot;bug&quot; they recently fixed, they will now require SMTP information. From us. To receive emails addressed to us.
 Specifically, we need to provide them with:
  
Mail Server name and port username password default sender email security type(SSL/TLS/None)
  
Has a vendor ever asked you for this information? It seems bizarre we would have to provide our own server to email ourselves. How would you even do this securely?
 Oh, and we can&#x27;t input this information ourselves -- we need to give it to them so THEY can set it up on their end! Sure, I&#x27;ll get right on emailing you a username and password to connect to our Exchange server.
 Our users just want to continue receiving these emails.

                              <span>Hey everyone. So I work in k12 and I&#x27;ve got this project that I&#x27;m working to implement over the summer and I was wanting some advice from those who are more network savvy than I am since I&#x27;m still pretty junior in this role.
 I&#x27;ve got 5 campuses all with their own NVRs on-prem to support their respective IP cameras. Each campus is connected to our main MDF/Server room via 10Gb Fiber connections in a Hub/Spoke topology. The idea here is to get rid of the old NVRs (they suck and require Edge in IE mode to even use) and move everything to a single server in our server room.
 The campuses all have the cameras on their own subnets but while some campuses have a completely isolated set of switches that only connect to cameras and the NVR, some of the older campuses don&#x27;t have isolated switches and simply rely on VLANs.
 So basically this is what I have: 5 Campuses with their own subnets, some with dedicated switches, others with dedicated VLANs (Security).
  
172.16.50.0/24
 172.17.50.0/24
 172.18.50.0/24
 172.19.50.0/24
 172.20.50.0/24
  
I need to remove the NVRs and get them talking to a server located at 10.0.9.75.
 Now what I would *think* I need to do, is simply make sure all physical ports that cameras are located on are simply Untagged with the security VLAN, and make sure all successive uplinks between switches all the way back to the core switch (which the server will be connected to) are Tagged with the security VLAN.
 One of my big concerns is whether or not I need to implement any kind of Layer 3 routing (beyond what we already have) with this setup. I don&#x27;t believe I do, but I would like advice on this if at all possible. 
 Please let me know if it seems like I&#x27;ve left something out or if I can answer any questions that might help better explain. Thank you

                              <span>After the recent incident with Viptela V-Edge we’re looking into a solution to get OOB Console access to all of our branch routers. In addition we’ve been fighting for funding to get a 4G/5G WAN failover for a while.
 Management finally said we can get cellular boxes, if we can get the wan failover piece and the OOB Console Service in one solution, so we can maximize value…
 But as I’m shopping around it really seems more like an “one or the other” situation?
 We want something top of the line, cradlepoint and open gear both look great, but can it do both with one SIM Card?

                              <span>Hi all. I have set all ports on a switch to be vlan 3 and untagged vlan 3. I realized my mistake too late when I couldn&#x27;t access the switch web ui.
 I&#x27;m using Linux and I&#x27;m sort of familiar with creating new interfaces and adding a vlan tag to it but I only mention this because I thought I could just try to access the switch by setting a static IP and vlan.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there really is a way to get back in to it. I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful in my attempts but thankfully I can switch it to unmanaged so connected computers can use it.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking for a fix for my mistake here.

I&#x27;ve never used their tech support, as I have my own team for that. I don&#x27;t need hardware replacement until I have a failure.
 Are the latest security updates worth it?
 My last IT person took care of this and I don&#x27;t recall more than one or two security updates over the years unless he was doing extras on the weekend he didn&#x27;t alert anyone to.
 Opinions on cost and value?

 I&#x27;m looking for an open source DNS server that can respond to queries by fetching data from a web API that I will configure. I came across Technitium DNS Server, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet and I&#x27;m not sure if it meets our requirements.
 Our goal is to scale https://pinggy.io horizontally, and to achieve this, we need a DNS server that can respond to queries with data from a database. Ideally, the DNS server would forward the query to a web API that we will create, and the web API will respond with the DNS response.
 Do you know of any open source DNS servers that can do this? Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

 Will I be able to create a gateway /32 and have a VLAN for each uplink on my switch that will allocate a /32 public address and share the /32 gateway without any security vulnerabilities for packet sniffing between machines?

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;ve been tasked with converting a largish network from mixed EIGRP and OSPF to fully OSPF. I know I can usually run the two alongside each other since default admin distances are different, however, my dilemma is that EIGRP is running everywhere except between a core switch and a firewall out to the internet. The core switch and firewall are OSPF neighbors. The core switch is redistributing the OSPF and EIGRP tables into each other. Can I go ahead and safely stand up OSPF between this core switch and all downstream switches without causing routing loops? Or will I be stuck with taking down EIGRP before configuring OSPF?

                              <span>I know we&#x27;re still good for several years with our current Prime deployment, but want to see what&#x27;s out there other than DNA that can do what Prime does for us.
 We mostly use it for lightweight access point management &amp; maps, client history (seeing what AP/switch ports a machine has been on), pushing &amp; backup up configs, though this one isn&#x27;t a huge deal as I know there are other good tools for this.

The ASA has a tunnel-group configured in this goofy format (tunnel-group &quot;ABC Taiwan VPN&quot; instead of ABC_Taiwan_VPN, the problem with this format is when setting up Identifier ID on Azure side you can&#x27;t add anything that are quotations mark, my question is what is the best way to fix the tunnel-group naming format within the ASA5500.

                              <span>Our system could not be accessed from a specific site location today. The platform that is hosted on AWS was being blocked because traffic was routing to a Germany region IP and not one of the US East region IPs that our organization is hosted on. Once we unblocked Germany traffic it went right through. We narrowed it down to being a global IP that our phone system should never redirect us to because our org is not hosted in that region
 Without sharing too much information, is it possible that Cisco umbrella or our vpn could be causing this issue, or is it more likely that AWS or the platform provider redirected their traffic due to an issue on their end?

                              <span>I was looking at OpenGear&#x27;s support for automatic failover to LTE and it seems viable. However, I seem to find conflicting information in their documentation on the correct topology. Some of their documents have it connected directly to the LAN, while others have it connected to the gateway.
 For anyone using it in this manner, may I please ask how you have it connected to your network(s)?

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I am not sure if I am at the right place to ask this, but here I go!
 I got a request from our QA team, they would like to have the ability to perform some test on our apps by simulating different network conditions, let say for adding some jitter, latency or reduce bandwidth a very low value.
 I can do some basic bandwidth throttling in the FW, but was wondering if anyone has a suggestion on how this can be perform and/or how I could give them as much control on the test they would like to perform.
 Thanx for you help!

                              <span>Hello, we have had a power loss(scheduled maintenance, no big deal) on one of our ASR 9006 routers(RSP440).
 After rebooting when entering config mode we got the following message:
 No configuration commits for this SDR will be allowed until a &#x27;clear configuration inconsistency&#x27; command is performed. 
 Apparently all the L2VPN configuration was not applied on startup.
 Any ideas on how to prevent this in the future or what I should look into?

 Im looking for technical support:
 I started working for a company where ewe offer terminal Server to our customers with RDP connection and those freeze for some customers. I looked up ways to test the network/protocols/internet connections and found iperf3. 
 Its been pretty helpful so far and I managed to solve/greatly improve the freezing situation with some cusotmers already but one thing keeps happening with every time I test: Trying to run the iperf command with multiple UPD streams simultaniously just starts - Giving me the message about a connection being established with port XYZ, but then just does not run - which I can see because if it runs, it spits out a line for each intervall on what happened. 
 Ive made a post here already, but no answer so far:

                              <span>A similar process has existed for many years dating back to the old Microsoft DirectAccess and their newer Always On VPN machine tunnels, but this question is specifically about the Cisco Management VPN Tunnels.
 First, I am seeing conflicting information whether or not the management tunnel should be full tunnel or not.
 TunnelAll even though it should only be providing access to domain controller, DNS etc. to allow domain joined Windows laptops to sign in without cached credentials? Does that make sense?
 There are also security concerns about the laptops having internal network access using the machine certificate and no password.
 Does the VPN tunnel do real time certificate validation so that if a laptop is reported stolen and IT revokes the certificate and/or disables the machine account in Active Directory, will new connections to the management tunnel access be immediately revoked or will someone managing the ASA need to take some manual action to prevent further access from the system?

 Any Umbrella SIC users here?
 Trying to establish a tunnel from Umbrella SIG and despite following confusing instructions - the tunnel won&#x27;t come up.
 Things get compounded by the fact that there&#x27;s no VPN logging in Umbrella UI.

                              <span>RFC 4604 Using IGMPv3 and MLDv2 for Source-Specific Multicast:
 2.2.3. IGMPv1 Queries, IGMPv2 and MLDv1 General Queries
  
If an IGMPv1 Query, or an IGMPv2 or MLDv1 General Query is received, the SFGMP protocol specifications require the host to revert to the older (IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1) mode of operation on that interface. 
 If this occurs, the host will stop reporting source-specific subscriptions on that interface and will start using IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 to report interest in all SSM destination addresses, unqualified by a source address. 
 As a result, SSM semantics will no longer be applied to the multicast group address by the router. 
 A router compliant with this document would never generate an IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 query for an address in the SSM range
  
How does it make sense, to say &quot;[General] query for an address in the SSM range&quot;?
 I&#x27;m not confusing this sentence with Group-Specific Queries, because for them in RFC 4604 is seperate section.
 Routers send General Queries empty without an address:
 RFC 2236 IGMPv2
  
In a Membership Query message, the group address field is set to zero when sending a General Query
  
And they send it to all hosts via 224.0.0.1.
 RFC 2236 IGMPv2
  
A General Query is addressed to the all-systems multicast group (224.0.0.1)
  
How should it be possible, to forbid General Queries to the SSM range (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255), when all hosts receive the Queries?
 The only possibilites what this means:
  
A Router never generates IGMPv1/IGMPv2/MLDv1 Queries? (But then why it mention explicit for SSM range?)
 I missunderstand something completely.

                              <span>We have a largish data center with a lot of automation centered on Netbox as our source of truth. Very happy with it. (switch configurations, DNS entries, DHCP scopes &amp; reservations all automatically created from the netbox model)
 I&#x27;ve been asked to replace our current DNS and DHCP servers (bind and ISC Kea) with Infoblox DDI. I have no Infoblox experience, but I hear good things.
 I&#x27;m concerned that Infoblox&#x27;s builtin IPAM functionality might interfere (or integrate poorly) with the Netbox IPAM model we currently use. 
 Does anyone here have experience integrating these applications? Thoughts or recommendations on how get the best out of both applications in a highly netdevops environment?

                              <span>Hey folks.
 I&#x27;ve been working on an issue with a customer where they have some VPN tunnels going through our service that has some issues affecting speeds for their applications. They have logs from their Cisco FTD about failed anti-replay checking. I don&#x27;t really want to get into the specifics on this, since I think the out of order packets is a red herring, but it did get me thinking about what is &quot;normal&quot; in these circumstances over the internet.
 I took some packet captures from our router at their branch site. I can see all tunnel packets being forwarded in perfect order ip.id 11, 12, 13, 14 etc. On the remote peer of this tunnel, I can see these tunnel packets arriving ever so slightly out of order intermittently, by about 1-3 packets. So for example, 23, 24, 26, 25 .... then 62, 63, 66, 64, 65. Again, a very low number of packets are actually out of order, something like a few hundred packets out of a capture file that is 100k packets in size. I am using the IPv4 Identification field to count and identify the packets, as our tunnel is a single stream, so I believe this should be valid.
 TLDR; As a UDP flow crosses the internet, is it normal for their to a very, very small amount of re-ordering? There is a lot of different physical media used by providers, carriers to provide transport and connectivity. Also, there LAG&#x27;s and different speed links, then QoS and queuing.... I&#x27;m not too experienced to know what is normal here or not. Anyone that can shed some light here?

                              <span>Hi All
 I have a question concerning a topic I never really found much actual objective information about: Packet queues and buffer depth on high throughput devices.
 Obviously not talking about dedicated hardware routers or virtual routers.
 Basically, the argument goes that some people put layer 3 switches at their edge and go &quot;well that works&quot;. And the are right. But some people argue that because of the shallow buffers on those devices they aren&#x27;t suited for edge routing.
 Same in the data center where I heard people say that the major reason that catalyst switches aren&#x27;t suited for data center is the fact they have very shallow buffers compared to Nexus or other data center switches. I know for fiberchannel this is a major issue, but for iSCSI this is... not so much an issue. FCoE, the less said the better...
 Is this BS or is there truth in this? I haven&#x27;t ever heard anything more than anecdotal evidence for this argument concerning buffer depth.
 Thanks :)

                              <span>I have always wondered about the actual benefit of using two firewalls in a high availability setup, syncing with each other and providing redundancy if one were to fail.
 What confuses me is that you have a single point of failure at the WAN switch between them and your modem, which is also typically a single point of failure as you usually only get one handoff. Am I missing something here with this logic? Or is there a better way to truly provide redundancy for WAN interfaces?

                              <span>What would you consider a good amount of time for the following account creation+full desktop setup:
  
User creation, group assignment in AD, sync to AzAD
 AzAD licensing
 Unboxing a computer + OOBE for local admin creation
 AzAD join, change hostname, run Windows Update + OEM&#x27;s firmware update software, reboot
 Login as user, check for any more updates, potentially reboot again
 Install M365 apps + Teams
 Manually license Adobe Team&#x27;s license, install Adobe Acrobat Pro
 Manually license TeamViewer, install
 Install Firefox, set as default, set up a handful of bookmarks
 Manually license and install Egnyte
 Install WinZIP
 Install one bespoke software
 Depending on the user, install one to two more bespoke software
 Install two required Outlook add-ins
 Update one of the add-ins because its public installer isn&#x27;t up-to-date for some insane reason 🙄
 Set Office Apps to compatibility mode for monitors
 Share calendar details with entire organization
 Install organization themes
 Install printers
 Install Zoom and its add-ins
 Clean everything up and run a script to change device owner in AzAD from user to global admin
  
Yes, I know a lot of this could be automated with unattend files, an image server, etc.
 The DC is legacy and needs to be deprecated and everything needs to migrate from hybrid to full-cloud.
 And all those applications should be SAML/SSO.
 But all of those things cost time and money, and I&#x27;ve been told no about each of them.
 I took flak from a higher-up non-technical person today because a set of deployments took a while (in the hours range, not the days range). I&#x27;m wondering how long someone else thinks this takes.
 EDIT: Lovin&#x27; the suggestions so far. One note: as soon as I&#x27;m able to the DC is getting put down, and that is my last device that /could/ run anything like an imaging server.

Want to see if there&#x27;s any one else that makes switches as robust as IOGear but at a more economic pricing. What do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Just wanna thank everyone for their advice in the previous post. I didn&#x27;t reply to many comments but I took the time to read them and consider what was being said. As some mentioned, I tried to re-pitch my ideas using more business terms and to try to frame the proposal as more of a risk management type of thing. The CTO&#x27;s response to that was that it&#x27;s too high-level and she wants more details.
 So I tried again (for the 4th time) with the following 2 items :
 - buying an EDR solution and installing it on every endpoint to protect from ransomware and other viruses
 - buying Windows Pro for the laptops and Azure AD P1
 Both of these suggestions were again rejected because:
 a) they were not detailed enough and didn&#x27;t show how the cost of the licenses would bring value to the company
 b) she claimed that we already have Azure AD. I had previously showed her that we have Azure AD Free which includes very few features and is certainly not enough to get where we want to go. Is she intentionally lying because she doesn&#x27;t want to spend on a P1 license? did she not check the console to confirm what she said? It&#x27;s not like this is a matter of opinion, she&#x27;s just refusing to see what&#x27;s there.
 So yeah, I tried again before giving up but at this point I just don&#x27;t see why I would spend more time fighting with this person who clearly has no intention of helping me in my duties.
 Also note: I confirmed they&#x27;re aiming for ISO 27001 certification - she said they previously had it in 2019 but it expired. Not sure how that&#x27;s possible but I saw the certificate myself so it&#x27;s true.
 EDIT: Just to clarify, the ISO certification is from 2018 and applies to software development and software products and services only. There was no surveillance audit done after the certification and it was not renewed. I haven&#x27;t been able to obtain the documents from the original audit yet to look at what they evaluated.

                              <span>Title; I did 4 years straight out of highschool but never finished my degree.
 Fast-forward 10 years: Currently a hybrid admin for higher ed (aka actual admin tasks like Zendesk / JAMF / Azure / etc administration mixed with helpdesk / desktop support).
 Been here for 5 years and finally feel secure enough in all aspects to take them up on their (basically free) tuition for staff. 
 I previously majored in film but considered pivoting those credits towards something else. I also had to pull a few strings to even get here because my resume was insta-trashed due to no degree in the first place.
 If you had the opportunity for a basically free, albeit slow degree, what would you study?

                              <span>5 years ago I was hired to work at a private school. Helpdesk plus, because they wanted me but my skillset was above helpdesk so they paid me a bit more and gave me more to do. 3 people, 100 employees, 200+ students.
 2 years later the boss leaves for another state. Family reasons. my coworker and I absorb his job, he gets the hot seat and I take on the Sys admin roles and most user facing duties. We work more like a team then a boss/subordinate pairing and life is good, though a bit overworked. We&#x27;re not just coworkers, were friends, and this makes life immensely more bearable.
 3 years later I find myself locking his accounts and shutting down his keycards. Didn&#x27;t have a great year and a lot of personal issue&#x27;s. He left amicably, and there&#x27;s no bitterness about it. it may be best for him to get a fresh start. A least thats what we decided the takeaway should be.
 But that leaves me, a one man shop. I know enough to keep the school running, but I dont even know who I answer to officially. They told me that I&#x27;ll learn how to do the budget stuff for the department Monday, but they literally just had my &quot;Letter of Agreement&quot; renewal 20 minutes before they told my boss he was leaving and there was no discussion of a title change or a raise. Apparently, they&#x27;ve been talking to an MSP and some restructuring, but I&#x27;ve been told my job is secure.
 I&#x27;m still a bit numb and trying to process it all. I don&#x27;t want to leave my job, I absolutely love where I am and what I do. but since everyone else rants on this sub about their job I figured I would pour some stress into the webs as well... And I have so many god damn passwords to change now! (Already started on the major one of course, but holy hell there are a lot)

                              <span>I have a basic folder structure which is:
 D:\Data\Folder1
 D:\Data\Folder2
 D:\Data\Folder3
 Shared out at the &quot;Data&quot; folder level so users map to \\server\data
 It&#x27;s a SMB with no real specific permissions so right now the permissions are basically flat.
 I need to make it so users can&#x27;t accidentally delete or move the top level Folder1, Folder2 and Folder3 folders.
 Generally I avoid deny permissions but for this they seem the most appropriate way of doing it.
 How would you do this please?

While is sounds cool, I can maybe do a couple hours of work off a single laptop screen but after a bit my neck hurts my back is hurting and frustrated from constantly minimizing and maximizing stuff. Is it just me or does everyone else need at minimum two full sized monitors to be productive and a mouse!

                              <span>I discovered this accidentally, while using PowerShell to review who had access to my calendar. I brought it to the attention of my boss during our weekly one-on-one. After the meeting I audited the person&#x27;s access to mailboxes and found they had full access to Senior Officers mailboxes. This access was not delegated by the affected users, no tickets granting access, no review.
 This is the second time I&#x27;ve caught this person doing this. I&#x27;m unsure if I should take it directly to HR or just let management take it from here. The last time, nothing came of it and it never went beyond the team&#x27;s manager.

                              <span>How do you guys handle saying no to certain requests? I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of requests that are very loosely related to IT lately and I am struggling to know where the line is. Many of these requests are graphic design, marketing, basic management tasks, etc. None of them require IT involvement from an authorization or permission standpoint. As an an example I was recently given a vector image with some text on it and asked to extrapolate that text into a complete font that could be used in Microsoft Word. Just because it requires a computer doesn&#x27;t make it an IT task! 
 Thanks for the input and opinions!

                              <span>I am dealing with 1 forest - 1 domain and multiple OUs, one for each separate site.
 The replication between Domain Servers works fine. 
 I have deployed 2 new GPs to a couple of sites (OUs) with no issues. 
 ​
 Now I am dealing with the 3rd site OU, with the same GPs applied to that site&#x27;s specific security group but they&#x27;re not being applied to none of the PCs or users involved. Enforcing doesn&#x27;t do anything. gpupdate completes successfully but gpresult shows nothing (nothing blocked either).
 ​
 What could be causing this? I don&#x27;t know where to look further.

                              <span>I had a user yesterday receive a phishing email with a link to &#x27;keep his password&#x27;. This email made it through our email filtering. It was sent by a legitimate business whose email address had been compromised. Our associate clicked this link which took them to a website mimicking a Microsoft login page. He typed his credentials in. At this point the malicious party had his credentials and attempted to sign into his account. The associate received the Microsoft Authenticator push notification. The push notification presented numbers that the party attempting to login would need to enter in order to gain access. This was new to the associate. He was used to the simple &#x27;approve&#x27; or &#x27;deny&#x27; buttons on the push notification. He admitted that they would have hit the &#x27;approve&#x27; button if it would have been presented.
 In last month&#x27;s meeting with executive management I explained the the CA policies we have in place for our 365 logins. Only 25% of our 365 accounts need to be able to connect from outside our facility (manufacturing), so we have a CA policy that prevents 75% of our accounts from connecting outside the facility. We also have a CA policy blocking connections from all countries other than USA, with an exception group we can temporarily add an associate&#x27;s account to for international travel. We have a CA policy enforcing MFA for all logins and a CA policy that requires modern auth clients to use approved client apps and protection policies.
 During this meeting I explained that we would be rolling out Number Matching for our push notifications. I explained that the flaw in the push notification is that associates are so used to approval prompts on their cellphones, that the chances of them approving an illegitimate login is quite likely.
 It feels good to have that validation that you&#x27;re not just talking crazy and that the scenarios you lay out actually can and will happen.

                              <span>We replaced our heavy volume printers with Ricoh 8400 machines and the print is way slower than our old HPs. I&#x27;ve figured out the reason is because every page that prints gets flipped in the duplexer even if the print is only one-sided. We have to load the paper in the trays upside down so it will print on the correct side. I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to correct this anyone have any ideas?

 recently we have been getting authentication failures from a mac address (failure logged on radius server).
 I logged into the network switch that reported it using SSH and the mac address doesn&#x27;t show up in the mac address table. (show mac-address  doesn&#x27;t return any values).
 How can I find more info on this?

I&#x27;ve been looking through the event logs using event ID 4624. It shows so many of them. I need to find the one&#x27;s where he physically logs on and off or RDPs into it. What is the easiest way to find these without going through each log trying to find the logon type? Thank you.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have LAPS deployed to all of our laptops, however its a gamble if the passwords work when I need them to for remote users. From what I understand, LAPS requires Group Policy refreshes and such to check-in or sync from time to time. Since we don&#x27;t have VPN for end users to touch the DC&#x27;s while offsite, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s part of the issue with the passwords not working.
 Am wondering if anyone has an alternative? Just need to run a CMD prompt as Admin on remote users laptops for installs, open Device Manager as Admin etc, nothing fancy.
 One thought is to write a system level service that&#x27;s deployed on all laptops. The service can be invoked under the user context and get permission to run Admin level commands from some from of Azure authentication that doesn&#x27;t require VPN or on-prem DC&#x27;s. 
 I&#x27;m willing to research and develop this, however just want to know if some existing solution is already out there. Not interested in packaging apps with Intune. Trying to make this simpler and &#x27;just work&#x27;.
 What are your thoughts?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 Cant quite find the answer i am looking for so thought i would ask here.
 I have a pair of 2012 R2 Hyper V hosts running a bunch of 2012 R2 Guests with one guest being a 2019 DC.
 I want (Need!) to upgrade the 2012R2 Guest servers to 2019/2022 (2019 based on the up2 suggestions)
 Can i just mount the media and run the usual in place upgrade steps and if so, is it recommended. Will a Checkpoint work for recovery should the upgrade fail? If no to both, what would you (should i) Do to get from 2012R2 to 2019 with the least disruption.
 I will deal with the Hyper V hosts another time; we might be able to replace them with some new poweredge hosts on 22 and just live migrate / replicate the guests over.
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are a machine building company. Up till now, we&#x27;ve been using Teamviewer for remote access to our machines. These machines are installed all over the world, and they all have a Windows PC on board, so Teamviewer was an easy way for remote access/support.
 However we want to move away from Teamviewer for 2 reasons:
 - security : we don&#x27;t want to use Teamviewer anymore, as it introduces a security risk in the customers network.
 - user friendliness: Teamviewer recently had a complete overhaul of it&#x27;s UI. Nobody likes it anymore.
 So as a solution, we want to equip all our machines with a VPN gateway device (eg Ewon or IXON). That way, we can connect via VPN to our machine local network (much safer). Once that we are connected via VPN, we can use VNC to remotely control the machine PC.
 I just started evaluating the different VNC implementations (TightVNC, ultraVNC,...). However they have not changed since I&#x27;ve used them about twenty years ago.
 I am missing drag and drop support for file transfer and performance (fluent updates) is way worse than Teamviewer. I also checked out Windows Quick Assist, but this requires manual starting the connection at the customer side. We need an &#x27;always on&#x27; server service so we can connect to the machine anytime.
 Does anybody has some suggestions for remote access that works (like VNC) only in a LAN (so no Teamviewer, Anydesk, Splashtop,...)
 Thx,
 Thomas.

                              <span>Hoping this is the right spot for this. Yesterday I logged on to one of our servers and got a pop-up telling me that something called Program already existed and could cause issues with programs running. I looked on the C drive and there was a file called Program that was like 125MB in size. I couldn&#x27;t find the original source of the file and my antivirus said it was clean. Today I had a user come to me because they had the same exact thing happen but the filesize was zero. Kind of concerned this may be malware but can&#x27;t verify for sure.

                              <span>Hello folks
 I have a self-build server at home with 8 drives and 4x nVME M2 SSD. Running proxmox on it with TrueNAS VM and my other LXC containers. So my PC case is full now (i have depleted PCIe expansion slots as well).
 On TrueNAS VM I have ZFS pool with 2 vdevs (1 vdev is 2x6TB mirrored 3.5 HDD) with 12TB storage. Yesterday I got notification from TrueNAS that pool is almost on 80% capacity.
 Can I get some tips on how to proceed with expanding storage ? I though about scaling out via Ceph cluster, but I suppose I will need to reconfigure my whole storage for this. I am planning to scale up to 24TB for example. I am using storage for my movie collection(Plex), family photos and games.
 Second problem is I have mounted storage on my promox containers in /foo/bar. Is possible to mount 2 different network storages to same location ie. tank1 and tank2 storage in /foo/bar ?
 Thanks for any tips and explanation.

                              <span>Single sysadmin, about 350 endpoints currently, but we are currently experiencing rapid growth and are expecting that number to be about 500 by the end of the summer. It comes out to around 6k, which I can justify pretty easily, but want opinions before that money gets spent. 
 I am looking into getting SmartDeploy, since I image quite a lot. Being vague, every month we get a new group of students, so I am looking at about 20-30 monthly. Those come back to me after the class ends, and need to get reimaged for the next person. Add on top of that new hires, a lot of my time is taken up with building laptops. 
 These do get taken offsite. 
 I currently have no device management system other than a remote connection software. This was an extremely small company before me, and the previous sysadmin did not scale up his shop to correlate with the rapid growth of the company. I&#x27;m basically building everything up. 
 Anyway - thoughts on SmartDeploy? Pros? Cons? Any other recommendations?

 I am working on stepping up our imaging of desktops/laptops procedures. We use MDT along with PDQ for imaging. However, what alternatives should I look at if our Imaging environment were to get compromised along with desktops/laptops?
 Maybe create a base image with all the applications/settings and slap it on a USB drive? How would you handle &quot;backup&quot; imaging solutions if a Cyber/DR Incident were to occur?

 I have 5 Domain controllers in my business environment and one of the controllers is only syncing in one direction. It is sending out its changes to the other controllers but when you make a change on any of the other sites this one problematic controller doesn&#x27;t see them. Any suggestions on what to troubleshoot would be helpful. Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>Our company recently hired a new CIO, and a big part of his role will be re-engineering our IT infrastructure.
 The new CIO seems very keen on getting rid of the server room altogether. He wants to move &quot;everything into the cloud&quot; including AD users, servers, network infrastructure, physical firewalls, endpoint security, web security gateway, DNS filtering, 802.1x authentication for wired and wireless users, endpoint management, network performance monitoring, file shares, and all business applications to SaaS.
 Currently, we have only emails on O365, 50% of servers on-prem with a quite traditional network with VLAN routed on the core switch and perimeter firewall high bandwidth redundant internet connections.
 Does anyone else have experience doing this type of transition? What are some of the solutions or architecture you guys would advise to satisfy the requirements?

                              <span>Hello ! I&#x27;m doing a lot of learning in my own labs recently and I noticed something a bit odd.
 I set up banned word list on Azure AD. It includes, for example, all fruits and animals. I understand how the password strength is calculated behind the scenes so even with my word list, the following password is accepted on AAD: Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee!
 ​
 I installed the agent and proxy right on the DC of my VM lab. I check the Event Viewer logs to track what happens. 
 However, this password above is not accepted. I guess it&#x27;s because it has the banned words? 
 So it gives me the impression that the Azure Password Protection agent does an exact match to the word list. If the password contains any of the banned words, then It&#x27;s rejected. However, on AAD, I can change the password to Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee! and Writeback seems to set it on premises as well.
 I feel like I am not understanding something ... Is this the expected behaviour? Or perhaps the configuration is missing something? Is it failing because the default password policy on a fresh Server 2019 DC requires numbers as well? (Just thought of this as I was writing this post).
 Thanks! You don&#x27;t know how much I appreciate comments from experienced admins. I learn so much from y&#x27;all.

                              <span>Hello there.
 So, this thing is annoying me in such a way that the part of my hair that&#x27;s not falling is getting more gray.
 I&#x27;m removing all Veeam infrastructure servers from the domain in order to get them a little more isolated of the network. I&#x27;ve started with the windows server proxies, as they have less components and I expected to be more easy.
 But, this is where things are getting crazy. When I remove any Windows server from the domain, when it reboots, it gets stuck with the previous user that logged on. If I&#x27;m smart enough to have logged on with the local administrator when removing the machine from the domain, at least I can log in. But if I forget that and use my domain account it get stuck after reboot. There is no option to switch to another user. Even if I log in with the administrator account and try to lock, sign out, switch account, any of that, it just doesn&#x27;t work.
 What am I missing here? Is this the effect of the remains of some GPO of the domain?
 While researching I&#x27;ve come across two policies that could be affecting in that way, but it seems that they&#x27;re not being applied, since the machine is not in the domain anymore.
 Interactive logon: Don&#x27;t display last signed-in &gt; Disabled
 Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers &gt; Not Configured
 I&#x27;ve also tried cleaning the GPOS after leaving the domain, by running: RD /S /Q &quot;%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicyUsers&quot; &amp;&amp; RD /S /Q &quot;%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicy&quot;
 By creating a new Windows Server VM, I can confirm that the normal, non-domain server have the switch user and also lists the local users, if it happens to have more than one.
 I don&#x27;t know what else to check.
 I&#x27;m including screenshots from two servers, one that have leaved the domain, and one fresh install, non-domain. https://imgur.com/a/sS5R6XG

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m currently working as a full stackdev, have been for a little under a year since I graduated. I&#x27;ve worked at both a startup and a corporate position, but I often find myself not enjoying what I do. I have a real hard time caring for what I do, essentially like many other devs I crate software that cuts costs, primarily data entry and data migration. 
 I&#x27;ve found that the biggest satisfaction I get from my work is actually helping people. When people come to me with an error during a UAT demo and I fix it there and then, the recognition from that goes a lot further than me staring at a broken function or a outdated depending for the better part of an hour. 
 I have experience with networking and basic data transfer protocols, but thats as far as it goes. I&#x27;m willing to learn, but don&#x27;t know where to look, what to look for or what jobs can come from this. Any and all information would be appreciated, thank. 
 P.S: should also mention that I&#x27;m based in the UK

                              <span>Turning on the &quot;Try the New Outlook&quot; button in outlook switches to the new version which looks like OWA. 
 It is probably some electron / webapp variant.
 We like most have a lot of business apps and flows integrated with outlook. The new version seems to break plugin compatibility and stuff like signature and contact management seems to be changing too.
 How are handling it?
 Any other thoughts or ideas?

 I see a lot of contract to hire jobs are out there. Are these jobs worth it? It is it better to hold out for another full time gig?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have Server 2008R2 /2012R2 /2016 /2019 /2022, Windows 10/11 clients as domain servers/members.
 Also We have Linux / Unix machines too.
 1 - For only Servers OU , I will apply a GPO like below. Correct ? 
 If we have the following settings:
 Servers: Member servers are in a separate OU (Servers), with a separate GPO (Servers) assigned.
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 OR
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) &#x3D; Disabled
 2 - Is there any a tool to help admins analyze systems and their connectivity, and network speed, and drive speed, and SMB versions installed and come up with a recommendation for the settings?
 3- Has anyone else run some benchmarks with SMB signing turned on and seen this performance hit?

 Presented by the guy who made the decision to force the TPM requirement. Since it&#x27;s supposed to be Read Only Friday today, I think it&#x27;s a good watch IMO for all WinAdmins. Might not all be implemented in Windows 11 but it&#x27;s their goal.
 A few key things mentioned;
  
Enforcing code signing for apps in Windows by default, with opt-out options. 
 
By default, completely blocking script files (PS1, BAT etc) that were downloaded from the internet and other permission limitations. 
 
App control designed to avoid &#x27;dialogue fatigue&#x27; like what you see with UAC/MacOS. OS will look at what apps the user installs/uses and enable based on that (ie, someone who downloads VS Code, Aida32, Hex Editors etc won&#x27;t have this enabled but someone who just uses Chrome, VPN and other basic things will). Can still be manually enabled.
 
Elaborates on the &#x27;Microsoft Pluton&#x27; project - something that MS will update themselves - implementing this due to how terrible OEM&#x27;s handle TPM standards themselves.
 
Working with major 3rd parties to reduce permission requirements (so that admin isn&#x27;t required to use). MS starting to move towards a memory safe language in the kernel with RUST.
 
Scrapping the idea of building security technologies around the kernel based on users having admin rights, and making users non-admin by default - discusses the challenges involved with this and how they need to migrate many of the win32 tools/settings away from requiring admin rights first before implementing this. Toolkit will be on Github to preview.
 
Explains how they&#x27;re planning to containerise win32 apps (explains MSIX setup files too). Demonstrates with Notepad++
 
Discusses how they&#x27;re planning to target token theft issues with OAuth.

                              <span>There is a great deal of user-generated content out there, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos, but we&#x27;ve generally tried to keep that off of the front page due to the volume and as a result of community feedback. There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>I really, really didn&#x27;t need this.
 Apparently a while ago I looked up drug laws in Kenya (marijuana is legal in D.C. where I work and my girlfriend is very fond of it) and as a result, an investigation happened without my knowing until yesterday when my equally confused Lead was informed I had to surrender my CAC and tokens, to be taken off base.
 The job was monotonous and not particularly engaging, but I learned a lot while there, and I do not want to resume going back to the Hells of a service desk position.
 I work overseas and am in no hurry to get back to the states. The job I was just terminated from is in AFRICOM near the middle east, does anyone subbed here have recommendations on where to apply? I&#x27;ve applied to positions with Jacobs, Amentum, and Vectrus so far. Ideally I&#x27;d like to move into another OCONUS position, and I&#x27;m trying to keep my head up.
 Side note: I need a beer.
 Additional note: I miss Popeye&#x27;s and Wendy&#x27;s. *sigh*

                              <span>Hi all,
 UPS are trying to send an email which they say is being rejected. There&#x27;s no sign of the messages on a message trace (Exchange Online) which suggest Microsoft are rejecting it before it even reaches us:
  
mx0b-002b8001.pphosted.com rejected your message to the following email addresses:
  
REDACTED
 Your message wasn&#x27;t delivered because the recipient&#x27;s email provider rejected it.
 mx0b-002b8001.pphosted.com gave this error:
 Local Policy Violation
 Here is a message header analysis - https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Tools/EmailHeaders.aspx?huid&#x3D;6c719633-ceeb-42df-86ec-70ebba6834bf
 ​
  
There is a blacklist from one Outlook.com mail server to another but I can&#x27;t imagine Microsoft would reject messages between their own servers?
 SPF is failing which suggests the IP address of the mail server used to send the message (UPS use ProofPoint by the looks of it) is not an approved sender for UPS.com emails.
 DKIM is failing but I think that&#x27;s related to the ARC relay modifying the message headers and not being a trusted ARC sender?
 DMARC is then set to reject messages
  
Is this purely a UPS problem or are we expected to whitelist their ARC sealers to allow the message through?

One of my colleagues deployed a gpo which ended up clearing all permissions of non domain admin members.

                              <span>Hello,I was wondering if I could ask you opinions?We have a new network, all Cisco, all very nice and shiny, but it is supplied by a third party that, for cost cutting reasons, don&#x27;t have any monitoring in place. (I may have ranted a bit when they cut this part). We are a subset of their network and they don&#x27;t even monitor their own.My question is, how do I best monitor uptime without access to the devices themselves? A consistent and consider approach. 
 We have on prem and cloud servers. We&#x27;ve remote facilities, without servers on, so I could at best ping the gateways on each site.
 Thank you for any insight you can offer.

                              <span>The problem is as follows, Domain Admins are a privileged group in the Active Directory and as a result, the ACL on these accounts is inherited from the AdminSDHolder object in the domain, where inheritance is disabled by default.
 However the option &quot;Include inheritable permissions&quot; is needed for ActiveSync to create necessary containers. Now if I undestand that correctly it is simply not possible, as a Dom-Admin, to receive emails from a mobile device without doing some icky exlusions. What is the best practice solution to this problem?
 Note that our client is running a 2010 On-Prem Exchange server and 2012 DC, and yes our MSP simply doesn&#x27;t have the size to refuse to work on older infrastructure. Also please excuse any problems with the english, not a native speaker.
 EDIT: it seems like some people are saying to just create a new user, is using a shared mailbox for both users (admin and non-admin) THE solution here? Seems sensible to me

                              <span>I have a couple of R740 boxes running 6.7 with the latest updates.
 They were originally installed three or four years back from the Dell custom ESXi ISO.
 I need to get them onto 7 which should be as simple as doing a firmware upgrade via the iDRAC to egt everything up to date then using the latest custom 7 ISO from the Dell website to do a straight upgrade.
 Appreciate random bad things can always happen but high level is anyone aware of any like major red flag issue with upgrading this way to 7 on an R740?
 It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s brand new hardware or ESXi releases.

                              <span>I know the answer will be no, but just wanted to confirm.
 We have interactive BenQ TVs and I want a lag-free streaming solution that also allows for touch input. The Microsoft Wireless 4K is flawless, but I can&#x27;t see any way for a HID input? 
 The other alternative Miracast products are ridiculously expensive (Screenbeams), or have lag that will make using whiteboarding painful (vivi/non-miracast).
 On that note, why is there lag with the BenQ RM03s? Is it the USB wifi dongle or the processor or software? If a better wifi adaptor resolves the issue that&#x27;d be ideal.

                              <span>I need some help here guys, I am working my ass off to cut down on access , between using non interactive service accounts with specific access to Just in time access for local elevation and rotating random admin accounts and password for work stations. 
 We have very little domain admin accounts anymore some are locked down no login service accounts and a few left for admins , 
 I have been working toward delegating access to cut down even more but we’re at the point where if you’re doing domain related functions you either are elevating with that account or using it for certain servers.
 It’s not perfect but considering we had 60+ domain admin accounts down to less then 10 is an improvement.
 But here is my problem 2 of our network admins think they REQUIRE domain admin access to there job and need to be logging in as domain admin on there daily workstation, using a local account with JITA access is to hard and elevating to use DA when doing specific domain tasks is also to hard.. they have network related functions such as DNS , DHCP and some AD functions via delegation but beyond that I don’t think network admin need more then that right? 
 Can someone please give me some sort of good write up on WHY logging in as domain admins on freaking work stations is bad and why it should be a limited and controlled / delegated function… I apparently can’t write up anything that is understandable enough to raise my issues with this and I need help… please !

                              <span>I manage 7 different physical locations. Each location is fairly small. Our main office has about 40 users or less and the other 6 locations have 10 or less users each. We have no internal resources such as servers or anything of that nature, so everything is cloud based. However, if I want to manage something at another site, I have to remote into a computer there. Such as a web interface to appliance, printer, network gear, etc. It would be nice if it were all connected on one network, but it would only benefit me. The only east way I can think to do it is a site to site VPN. Any thoughts? Worthwhile or any other tips?

                              <span>So I was recently hired to handle the IT department of a large concert venue and it&#x27;s payment systems. I don&#x27;t have much experience in this environment but am pretty sure they pulled a quick one. I wasn&#x27;t given much explanation of job duties or my schedule but when I applied it seemed like a seasonal position that would be typically for show days. That position is apparently still open. My position, Technology Supervisor is like 8 hours a day and longer on show days. I&#x27;d currently be making like $38k a year but now I might have to travel somedays into the city with personal vehicle. This is a big jump since now I&#x27;m paying tolls and dealing with city traffic. I&#x27;m going in tomorrow to ask for basically $40k a year to start. Am I in a good spot since I&#x27;ve already started? Tia Ps the venue is huge, seats over 20k people and id be walking to every stand during the dead of summer.

 Netsh will not run at all. Every time we try to run it there is an app crash log generated and the process dies. 
 We only noticed it because of our VPN client wouldn’t add the routes after connection. 
 I’ve tried the sfc scan and all the dism options but nothing seems to fix it.

                              <span>Good afternoon, I&#x27;m looking for a switch to replace an Ubiquiti Edgeswitch 16 XG (It has 12 SFP+ Ports and 4 RJ45 ports) as a core switch something a little more reliable it will be gateway. Our network is pushing at least 1tb in a 24 hour time span. 
 My question: What are some switches with a competing brand that have the same amount of SFP+ ports? As well as some Copper ports. Without insane licensing fees or am I just stuck?
 Thank you in advanced!

                              <span>I am wondering if anyone has had this issue... 
 I currently have a 4 node Hyper-V cluster. I have decommissioned a few servers and removed them from the cluster.
 The issue is that for some reason this has left the .vhdx file behind and stripped the permissions from the file so it can&#x27;t be modified.
 I have tried runing icacls to add the VM SID back on, however everything fails because there are zero permissions on the file.
 Find it weird that the process in Hyper-V cleans up all of the other files but leaves behind the vhdx file, this has happened across a couple of servers now also...

                              <span>Starting around 9:30am CST this morning we started getting a large influx(from ~100 blocked per hour yesterday to 700-900 blocked per hour today) of blocked spam emails on our Barracuda caught using the Spamhaus ZEN feed. Looking at the logs most of it seems like actual spam but some legit emails are getting caught all of a sudden. 
 Is anyone else seeing something similar today?
 Something else that&#x27;s interesting is that over 50% have a source address of mail-{xyz123}.outbound.protection.outlook.com

                              <span>I consider myself especially late to the game with respect to DKIM and DMARC. At my last corporate gig I didn&#x27;t have them set up until around 2021. I don&#x27;t know when I started using SPF but it was probably 2018. 
 One of the services I&#x27;ve been providing since I started freelancing is configuring email authentication for small businesses and a minority of them have it set up. Which I&#x27;d expect...I mean it&#x27;s not usually automatic and they don&#x27;t know they should set it up. I&#x27;m happy to take their money. 
 However, it also seems pretty rare among IT companies I encounter.....even companies purporting to specialize in Cyber security! I&#x27;d estimate a quarter of the IT companies I look at have no DMARC record at all, 25% have a record, but policy isn&#x27;t enforced, and another 25 percent have the policy enforced. 
 So what&#x27;s the deal? Did I miss the memo saying that stuff isn&#x27;t important anymore? Do I just encounter shitty IT companies? Is everyone so busy installing NGAV and EDR systems that they neglect the basic stuff?

                              <span>Has anyone had issues getting an excessive number of blue screens from Dell Inspiron 3505 laptops?
 It seems like our company received a bad batch a little over a year ago, so I was curious about how wide-spread this issue is. We&#x27;re currently sitting at almost 50% of them (that we know of) having daily blue screens, all from the same issue: bad RAM. From my testing, it seems that these laptops are killing the RAM sticks. I ran memtest86 in one of them and it showed a ton of errors. I replaced the RAM, ram memtest86 again which passed all the tests, and then a week later it started having blue screens again and failed memtest.

                              <span>I have a very strange issue with WDS where I now can&#x27;t approve pending devices on a new server that we setup using Server 2022. The previous server was on Server 2016. 
 When I install WDS on the new Server (in Standalone mode, same mode WDS was using under previous set up) I can&#x27;t approve any pending devices and get an &quot;Element not found&quot; error message. 
 WDS settings used: 
 PXE Response: Respond to all client computers (known and unknown) - Require admin approval for unknown computers is ticked. Boot: Known/unknow clients: Continue the PXE boot unless the user presses the ESC key DHCP: Do not listen on DHCP ports - unchecked, Configure DHCP options to indicate that this is also a PXE server - unchecked TFTP: Maximum Block Size: 0, Enable Variable Window Extension - unchecked Rest are as defaults 
 I&#x27;ve found that if I untick &#x27;Require admin approval for unknown computers&#x27; the devices skip the pending stage and will image fine but I need to be able to retain control of which devices can receive an image through PXE. 
 I also have found that I can click the Approve and Name option, give the client I am trying to image a name and run through a wizard without filling in any of the other options and it then works. I found the flat file that contains the approved clients on the old server and every device has a name like &#x27;Domain Admin1&#x27; &#x27;Domain Admin2&#x27; and so on. It&#x27;s not the end of the world to have to do it this way but I&#x27;m still hopeful there is a way to get it to work like I had on the older server where I could simply right click the client and hit approve.
 The new server is domain joined member server only with just the WDS role installed. DHCP remains on a different server. I&#x27;m logged into the new server with admin rights. 
 Just can&#x27;t see what is causing this, any ideas?

 ​
 I don&#x27;t want to place them from A to B but a custom view. When i try to drag folders up and down its possible to do like shown in this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/hojf1vV.png A black bar appears and when i release it it puts the folder there. For the user, the black bar doesn&#x27;t appear and she can&#x27;t move anything up or down, only place folders inside of other folders. 
 ​
 Anyone know how i can fix this?

                              <span>TL;DR - Has anyone else run into employees using low-cost VPN providers and how have you dealt with it?
 We recently implemented a robust security platform and have since discovered that about 10 of our work-from-home users are using low-cost VPN providers to connect to our corporate resources ( We do not have or require a corporate VPN in place for access as all of the resources are publicly web-based). We found that a few of them are choosing to have endpoints in South America and Europe. Despite the increased latency from the VPN and the subsequent latency from the endpoint location they are picking (we are US based), 9 out of 10 of these people aren&#x27;t technical and have no idea why they are using a VPN apart from it making them &quot;safer&quot;. 
 Much like other employers, we now state that employees must have their own reliable internet connection at home, but that&#x27;s where it stops. Keep in mind that these low-cost VPN providers are not being installed on any corporate-owned devices and are either being installed on their personal PC that they are then accessing things like OWA or other web-based resources, or a few that have installed and setup the VPN inside their home firewall and is funneling all traffic from their internal network through the VPN. Please refrain from suggesting to just shut their access off. I am looking for how others have handled this situation and not suggestions on how to screw the users over.
 The real-world impact of the users using these VPN providers is that it affects their performance, sometimes creating &quot;impossible travel&quot; alerts when they switch endpoints, and possible blindspots to security threats (as explained in the next sentence). I am hesitant to create policy exceptions in the security platform as the threat hunters indicated that a lot of real-world bad actors use these VPN providers to help add an extra layer of obfuscation when attacking a target.

                              <span>Greetings everyone, long time lurker and sysadmin for 10+ years here.
 I&#x27;ve been having an SMB connection issue in my evironment for about a month now and I&#x27;m stuck. Essentially I have SMB connections dropping at random. Could be a mapped drive or an open file in excel. 
 Typically to recreate the issue I have a drive mapped to our file share and I work with files on the shares. When the connection drops my mapped drive shows connected but shows no used space indicator. Try opening the drive and it askes for authentication; however, any authentication is met with access denied. If I unmap the drive or in some cases the drive won&#x27;t be mapped but I have notepad++ open with a file from the share it will recover.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried all the typical troubleshooting with SMB. Wireshark shows the access being denied, almost looks as if the client thinks it already is auth&#x27;d but the server sees it as anonymous. Wiresharked both client and server and confirmed they are communicating. Procmon shows nothing useful. SMBClient, server and connectivity logs show absolutely nothing about my user ID even authenticating or anything related to my connection.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried using the DFS share, regular UNC path with hostname and IP and still get access denied. It&#x27;s not tied to one specific client, server or user.
 ​
 Really stuck on this one if anyone has an idea.
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a weird issue, hoping someone can help.
 I&#x27;ve got an issue where mapped drives (to a local networked NAS) get mapped fine, however they will randomly disappear from File Explorer. If I issue a &#x27;net use&#x27; command, the drives are listed in an &#x27;unavailable&#x27; state.
 I can still ping the NAS by both IP and name when the drives aren&#x27;t there, and I can remap them fine, but I am struggling trying to figure out what may be causing this. Sometimes even logging out and back in will cause the drives to disappear.
 I should add, that there is no local domain, the machines are AAD joined.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a bit of a pickle here and could use some advice. I&#x27;ve got an application that requires a physical USB token (a Yubikey) to be plugged into the machine. The application itself is lightweight, running smoothly on less than 1 GB of RAM, and the daily traffic it generates is just a few MB.
 Now, I&#x27;m wondering what my best options are for hosting this application. What type of datacenter services should I be looking into? Should I go for a private setup or consider bare metal?
 I&#x27;ve thought about buying a server, plugging in the USB token, and colocating it in a datacenter. However, that might be a bit of an overkill. So, I&#x27;m hoping to explore alternative solutions before taking that step.
 If any of you know of a datacenter that would be open to accommodating this unique requirement, I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you could let me know. Feel free to reply here or drop me a PM.
 Thanks a ton!

 I saw some companies asking candidates to record a video asking screening questions about their profile to understand their profile a little bit better before an interview and I became curious to know your opinion about that.
 Have you ever tried to do something similar? If not, why, and if yes, how were the results? Do you believe it&#x27;s a good thing for the candidate and the interviewer?

                              <span>The only thing holding me back from rolling it out everywhere is that, on systems that are reimaged that are already in an OU where LAPS is applied, the LAPS password breaks the MDT setup because of the changed password. 
 If it resides in an OU where LAPS isn&#x27;t applied, it works fine. 
 I&#x27;ve tried moving the &quot;join domain&quot; to the end, but that hasn&#x27;t worked as anticipated. I have a task in MDT that deploys the VPN, but it has to be on domain before it does that in order to get the necessary certificates. 
 ​
 We are using the LAPS that got released last month. We had the same issue with the old LAPS, but it was decided to handle administrator passwords a different way back then. This year, we planned on going to LAPS, and the new version&#x27;s release just sped up the deployment. It all works perfectly for new builds, but rebuilds it crashes on, and I know there has to be a better way of handling it than just manually moving/deleting the old computer and letting it rebuild. Personally, I&#x27;m fine with that, but help desk isn&#x27;t thrilled, and they&#x27;ll just forget to do it before they deploy, and we&#x27;ll end up with a semi-broken, half-baked system

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered why there are no ADMX editors. Today I had once again a registry key, I could push via GPP, but it might&#x27;ve been much nicer, to create an ADMX for that use-case. So I asked Google and once again I wasn&#x27;t able to find something for that use case. 
 I then thought: Today there&#x27;s a Visual Studio Code extension for almost anything, so of course there will be an ADMX/ADML extension for VSCode. But no, there isn&#x27;t. 
 Am I blind? And if not, does any of you know why there aren&#x27;t tools out there, to create small ADMX/ADML files for us MSP based sysadmins?
 Thanks for some insights!

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 I am looking for a software that will draw a FULL network map:
 ​
  
I list all the Switch and Access points, including: 
 IP
 admin or user credentials
 SNMP data
 
 It should draw a map that includes those switches and all devices (at least mac address) connected to each port of each switch.
  
I tried a few software (the one I&#x27;m testing now is PandoraFMS), but they draw only the switches and APs.

We have 1Password quite a few users in the company and we&#x27;ve been trialing it with this department and they like it. The only issue we are running into is that we don&#x27;t know how they are going to access these passwords on our POS machines. Each machine has a different AD account, which is shared by whichever user is on the computer. 
 What they are doing now is independently maintaining a shared Chrome account with the passwords saved, but ideally I&#x27;d like if all the passwords could be maintained in one place. 
 Is anyone else using a password manager on shared accounts, and how do you have users authenticate?

                              <span>Background: I have a VDC where I run warm backups of certain servers offsite for DR purposes. This is VPN connected via 1Gbit Fibre.
 Problem: Some additional Directories on various machines need to be synced to a single server in the VDC. What method is best? Should I use AD DFS Replication, or maybe another utility. 
 All machines are backed up and synced to a different Veeam Repository off-site, restores will take a while, therefore the warm backups.

                              <span>Well, basically the title. We got our hands on a few Igel Thin Clients through a refurbished shop on ebay (not some backyard sale - kind of shop but one with a long history of selling on ebay various kinds of refurbished material). Model M340C to be specific. We plan to use them as emergency backup devices, y&#x27;know? Worst case and that, in case everything goes wrong, you have some old devices in a box that you can pull out and use with a temporary license. 
 However, the devices seems to be still configured with the data from the former owner. Not that there is much to harvest, it&#x27;s set to load a website that&#x27;s not existing anymore and that&#x27;s all. As far as I can tell at least. However I can&#x27;t get into the admin settings to delete the certificate or other settings as it&#x27;s password locked.
 Igel Clients can&#x27;t be reset to factory settings (as far as I know) without involving the Igel support (think of it like the 48 character code for bitlocker locked devices) and that might require some informations of the previous owner, that we don&#x27;t have. I&#x27;m confident that they still may help us however, that would be a bit time consuming to prepare that codes for all the devices and the discussion with them. 
 So I hoped that someone might know a different workaround, if I can access the device on a different way and get rid of the certificate that prevents me from adding it to the managment suite and so on. 
 Also I hope that since the devices are not reset, that the former owner also didn&#x27;t removed the licenses. Since that requires a maintenance subsription with Igel, there is a solid chance the license is still on it and is hardware/MAC bound. A reset would remove that.

                              <span>We have recently started making some software, and we have to give occasional updates for customers for fixes etc.
  
 Currently, 1 person has perms to share from the SP/OD to the customer, but I&#x27;m not a fan because his range is too wide and its development updates. So carries risk + I don&#x27;t like the sharing direct from the SP/OD.
  
 So I want to find a way we can give the updates, and they are customer specific, so they are not the same across customers.
  
 I wondered about using a private file upload site because at least then we can email the customer the link and have it expire in &quot;x&quot; days etc. We would still need to find a way to limit his transfer ability, maybe 1 folder in the SP he can copy the file to that allows upload?
  
 Can anyone give me any ideas, pointers on how you handle this?

                              <span>Anyone else seeing odd taskbar behavior in Win11 (22H2 - Pro)? Disappears, icons are missing, blinks. We’ve seen this with a handful of users out of about 250 users on Win11. Only commonality is Office 2021 Standard and an AS400 terminal program. Swapped laptops, reimaged, and the issues follow. Tried an image via MDT (same image all machines get) and loaded the OS from a USB. I’d really hate to roll them back to 10, but for the sake of their sanity I may need to until we get this figured out.

 I believe this is to limit costs on the analytics software licensing. Obviously this is a major security concern (MFA is not enabled).
 Do I need to pull the cord on the parachute and exit?

                              <span>Good afternoon everyone!
 I tell you my problem and my scenario set up.
 I have a site to site VPN between a Wachtguard Firewall and a Mikrotik Hex Router, connected without problems via IKEv1 in tunnel mode with IPSec in Tunnel mode.
 The ping from the Mikrotik subnet --&gt; towards the Watchguard Firewall subnet is executed correctly with a constant speed of 28 ms without interruptions TTL&#x3D;126
 The problem I have is when I connect via Remote Desktop from the Mikrotik headquarters to the server where the Watchguard Firewall is located.
 The speed is very very slow, and the connection quality is poor. Disconnects from set slow.
 I have tried to configure with IKEv2 in a way with another encryption protocol in PHASE1 and PHASE2 with identical results.
 Also to rule out, I have configured with Firewall Wachguard headquarters A and remote headquarters B and the RDP connection is established correctly and smoothly.
 I have increased the UDP connection tracking time to 20 seconds, but with identical results.
 OS version is 6.49.7
 I&#x27;m new to MIkrotik and I can&#x27;t find any clue that I can solve, thanks!

                              <span>What&#x27;s a good VPN option for businesses (road warrior) that supports Azure AD authentication (+ MFA)? We&#x27;re currently using the community version of OpenVPN but are planning to phase out our AD setup and only have AAD left (with MFA enforced). While I know that the paid version of OpenVPN can support this, I’m interested in exploring other (more polished) options. We need a network VPN for our employees. A terminal server/VDI environment isn&#x27;t sufficient. Any suggestions (commercial/open-source)? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>We have a problem with Teams on M365 Outlook. The Teams add-in does not appear on the ribbon. If we add it it is greyed out.
 We have not been able to get it to work.
 In M363 admin we see:
 &quot;Multiple users not seeing add-ins in Outlook If you test Outlook add-ins and none show up, as a first troubleshooting step, use the Get-OrganizationConfig PowerShell cmdlet to query the AppsForOfficeEnabled parameter. If the query returns a value of False, set this parameter to True by using the Set-OrganizationConfig cmdlet, so add-ins appear as expected.
 We do not recommend that the AppsForOfficeEnabled parameter is set to False. A value of False overrides all of the above Administrative and User role settings and prevents any new apps from being activated by any user in the organization.
 For more information, see Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/add-ins-for-outlook/specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins#user-roles?WT.mc_id&#x3D;365AdminCSH_SupportCentral&quot;
 We have tried the stuff that is mentioned, and on pages referenced by that page. Can&#x27;t get it to work.
 It does work if the user has admin rights. So either something is not being installed properly, or something is silently getting denied access at run time.
 Does anyone have any ideas please?

                              <span>Hi all, I was wondering if anyone has come across any issues within their laptop fleet in regards to Microsoft Azure VPN client constantly (VPN can disconnect continuously throughout the day).
 From what we seen so far it seems that the disconnect is triggered locally but isn&#x27;t initiated by the users.
 We&#x27;ve tried removing a lot of the dell bloatware (optimiser being the prime suspect) but the same disconnects are still occurring.
 Does anyone have any ideas on why the VPN client would cause constant drops across a fleet of around 150+ with a mix of dell and surface laptops.
 Thanks in advance for anyone for their time.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m happily using Amanda as a backup system with a Spectra Stack library. Everything works well however my setup to optimise at best the tape usage doesn&#x27;t really satisfy me. One step at a time.
 Amanda has a &quot;one tape per run&quot; approach which means that every time &quot;amdump&quot; is run Amanda would use a new tape. The creator had its reasons to design this in such a way and it is mainly for reliability: to spread around the data. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Amanda is pretty clever in planning the backup within the dump cycle nonetheless I end up with a lot of tapes only partially used because of it&#x27;s default approach (and probably my imperfect setup).
 I&#x27;ve solved this issue by using &quot;flush-threshold-dumped&quot; which, as stated in the man pages, &quot;will not begin writing data to a new volume…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks!
 After a year and a half in the helpdesk, a Comptia A+ cert and a CCNA, I finally made the transition I was looking for and became a sysadmin in a new company. It was an incredible move for me, and I was looking forward to taking on more responsibilities and challenging tasks. However, after a few weeks in my new role, I&#x27;m starting to feel a bit disillusioned.
 The main issue is that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually doing much sysadmin work. My days seem to revolve around managing Mosyle MDM and SnipeIT, and apart from that, I find myself with a lot of downtime. I&#x27;ve brought this up with my manager, but they haven&#x27;t given me any additional responsibilities yet. Do not even have AD access.
 Now, I understand that every job has its slow periods, but it feels like hours are passing by with me not really contributing much. It&#x27;s becoming demotivating, and I&#x27;m starting to question whether this is the right company.
 I do enjoy the moments when I get to dive into more technical tasks and troubleshoot complex issues, but those seem to be few and far between.
 I know how challenging is to break out of the helpdesk role so..., fellow sysadmins, I need your advice. Have any of you experienced similar situations early on in your sysadmin career? Is this just a temporary phase, and should I stick it out a bit longer? Or should I start considering other options? Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.
 Note I recently started working from home 2 days a week, which is something I was looking for from long ago. Those days at home, I am basically getting paid without doing anything in 8 hours. Its ridiculous.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 I work for an MSP with SMB. I&#x27;ve implemented Zabbix 5.0 as a monitoring services for our clients. Some are directly connected some via zabbix proxy.
 Since mainstream support for Zabbix 5.0 will end this month I am looking at either migrating to 6.0. We need to monitor:
  
Windows and Linux OSs
 VMware hosts/vCenter (with host discoverability)
 IPMI of servers (for hardware issues) 
 Veeam backups (this one is critical)
 Don&#x27;t care about fancy
  
I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution basically by first checking readily available Veeam integration. Found Centreon, but could not find enough recent feedback on reddit. Any thoughts on the product?
 Zabbix is awesome, but not perfect:
  
Not easy to display which customer the host belongs to
 The Veeam integration that we used does not monitor backup copy jobs
 Proxies are annoying to deploy and manage

                              <span>Apologies if this has been asked before. I scanned the other posts with similar situations but haven&#x27;t found a resolution that works.
 I installed EVE-NG on GCP and have access to the URL login page. When entering the credentials for native console or HTML5, nothing happens. No errors or failed login attempts.
 I followed troubleshooting steps here and nothing worked.
  
To fix permission, enter this command in eve-ng console or ssh “/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions”
 Fix eve-ng SQL database using “unl_wrapper -a restoredb” in your eve-ng console or ssh.
 The hard is not full
  
Fix is to use &quot;Admin&quot; not Root when logging in

                              <span>What do other people do?
 I manage 7 different physical locations. Each location is fairly small. Our main office has about 40 users or less and the other 6 locations have 10 or less users each. We have no internal resources such as servers or anything of that nature, so everything is cloud based. However, if I want to manage something at another site, I have to remote into a computer there. Such as a web interface to appliance, printer, network gear, etc. It would be nice if it were all connected on one network, but it would only benefit me. The only east way I can think to do it is a site to site VPN. Any thoughts? Worthwhile or any other tips? I know nothing about SD-WAN but interested in knowing more about it if it would be cost effective? My initial reading is that it’s not for a SMB like us, but I just started reading about it.

                              <span>In my last post I inquired about getting a dedicated 10gig fiber connection for a 40-unit condo in Boston.
 I got great advice and even had people reach out offering their help.
 Ultimately we are leaning towards a 1gb DIA connection and bursting to 10gb. We were able to get this quoted at $900 on 5 year contract with Crown Castle with a /26 for 64 dedicated IPs.
 What we plan to offer is along the lines of: 
  
 100/100 - Included in HOA fee ($8 increase)
  400/400 - $39 add-on
  1000/1000 - $99 add-on
  10,000/10,000 - $299 add-on
  
The reason for this was ultimately to avoid friction from getting it installed in building and wanting to be able to tell units that they can get 100/100 fiber-backed Internet for a $7.50 increase in HOA dues (we are including savings from eliminating Comcas…</span>

                              <span>so I am creating a pcap script using the pcap third party lib in C. I have basic knowledge of the networking such as the TCP/IP model and was looking to apply these skills in a short script that sniffs packets based on pre determined rules such as listen to packets from port 443 and does a DNS lookup based on the source ip to get the domain and displays in a table format. Nothing too fancy because my knowledge of networking past this point is limited. I am using pcap documentation and am using a wireless interface(wlp2s0). The first problem I am receiving is with the pcap_lookupnet which should return network and mask ipv4 addresses such as (192.168.32.4 and 255.255.255.0). When ran the expected returns results are not returned instead the network number returned is 43200 and mask of 16777215. documentation I am following.
 OS - Linux
 Distro - Ubuntu 22.10
  if(pcap_lookupnet(inter4,&amp;net,&amp;mask,err_buffer)&#x3D;&#x3D;-1){ // triggered if lookupnet returns -1 indicating failure printf(&quot;Could not find ipv4 address of sniffing device&quot;); return -1; } printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,net); // returns 43200 ?? what is the significance of this number printf(&quot;%d&quot;,mask); // retuns 16777215 ?? what is the significance of this number

                              <span>Hi there. My company are considering moving to a bigger office and discussions have been taking place about ISPs and whether or not we should get a managed ISP router or not. I&#x27;ve never been involved in an office move before so I&#x27;m trying to educate myself. What is meant exactly by a managed ISP router? I thought when a business signs up to an ISP the connection comes with a router that they can connect their firewall into for example. What&#x27;s an alternative setup?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m going to keep my question brief and give as much of an overview as necessary so that you wonderfully smart people can guide me in the direction by way of articles, advice, tips or tricks.
 I am in a pickle. We currently use a vendor who provides us with a service which is awfully useful to us. Without going into incredible detail for the sake of brevity, this service provides us the ability to present our remote cellular routers as existing within the same vnet and from here, we can monitor them with SNMP.
 The reason we do this is because we need to reboot these routers each day, the routers may also be rebooted without warning or reason - and because they are cellular routers, each time they reboot they obtain a new public IP. 
 This, therefore, makes it rather hard to simply probe their WAN interfaces. 
 Anyway, what I need to do is find away to effectively recreate this service as our vendor is doing away with it - gee thanks! 
 I am looking at using an NVA inside of azure - I’m not bothered by the vendor right now, I just need a POC - this NVA will be the VPN headend for our remote routers and I am hoping to present to them a subnet from which we will deploy our sensors to to provide remote monitoring.
 At the moment, I am using a Sonicwall NSv - but I fear I’ve vastly over simplified matters. The testing of my IPsec VPN policy between a remote site and the NVA shows packets coming and going on ports 500, but the ports on 4500 are being dropped somewhere.
 Now this isn’t a tshooting question (I’ve got other posts for that - and yes I’ve enabled NAT-T, IP forwarded on the azure interface, etc etc) 
 What this post is asking is, am I looking at the solution correctly? Is a site to cloud solution the best thing to do? We do not have the ability to use on prem equipment - we don’t have our own core network! - so our needs are pretty much all cloud based.
 Anyway long post over - thank you

                              <span>hello all! looking for some advice on install, i am in canada btw so i won&#x27;t have access to some stuff like meraki go etc
 I will be doing another smb wifi accesspoint install. In the past few years I have done two installs in which both required about 10-20 accesspoints and at that time I went with unifi and till this day everything is working great. So for my next scheduled install I was going to bite the bullet on unifi again but thought i would get some insight on some other brands/products. I did some searching around and seems like for my price range Unifi vs Engenius Fit vs Aruba Instant On is all kinda in the same price range so I guess I am looking to compare that.
 Truth be told, my budget is max the cost of a unifi install, I could slightly raise it if need to but don&#x27;t want to surprass the budget of what a unifi install would cost me.
 Right now for this install I am planning around 30 accesspoints, probably need 1 x 16 port switch + 2 x 8 switches or maybe 4 x 8 port switches + whatever else i need to be able to run captive portal/splashpage and will run whatever router i can find that they provide or is recommended.
 maybe i am old school but tbh uap ac pro have been good enough for me (i really doubt people need more speed) but i guess maybe it is time to make the switch to wifi 6, maybe it will have better range?
 i did some brief searching and my potential unifi build was something like this
 6 x 5 packs of the uap ac pro/nano hd (will buy whatever i can find in 5 pack?)
 udm dream machine or udm pro
 unifi poe switches
 i don&#x27;t think i want to pass a budget of 8000$ cad tbh (this is what a unifi with nano hd 5 pack would hit)
 i know if i went with engenius i would be able to comfortably fit wifi 6 under my budget but not sure if the product is superior. also for aruba instant on seem like they are pricey as well and prob similar to unifi in price range but not sure if they are better etc
 thanks!

                              <span>Short version: My predecessor signed the company up for pretty meager service with Spectrum and I&#x27;m trying to renegotiate our 3 year contract to get higher throughput at a hopefully lower price. We&#x27;re only 8 months into it so offering to renew the contract doesn&#x27;t get them excited. What other levers are there to get an ISP to up your throughput at the same or lower price? What else could we offer that they care about?
 Long version: We have two fiber circuits through Spectrum - 1g directly from them and a 100m carrier diverse circuit managed by Spectrum but actually provided by some combination of GTT and Frontier. We reach 90% of our capacity up and down at least once a day so I&#x27;d like to get that second connection up to 1g to A) provide more headroom and B) have a viable secondary circuit. If a backhoe finds our sole 1g line, we&#x27;d be in for a lot of hurt trying to run the business on the 100m alone.
 But we&#x27;re only 8 months into our contract. I&#x27;d hoped to get better service at a lower price by renewing (I&#x27;d originally been led to believe we were half way through our contract) but they&#x27;re not interested. Is there anything else I can offer them to sweeten the deal in their eyes? All they&#x27;re offering right now is to increase our throughput on the secondary line with a corresponding cost increase. 
 They&#x27;re also posturing that they resell price they&#x27;ve received from GTT/Frontier is something they have no control over even though the number Spectrum gave me for a 1g Frontier connection is 30% higher than what Frontier quoted me directly.

                              <span>Sorry if topic title is not worded well. I&#x27;ll admit: troubleshooting obscure issues with wireshark is tricky sometimes. My problem is, our workstations are so darn chatty.. at any given slice of time, even during a 1-2 minute pcap, there is usually dozens of tcp sessions, to random microsoft IPs, and other cloud IPs... very difficult to pinpoint exactly what is interesting traffic, if you don&#x27;t know an exact destination hostname or IP address. I&#x27;ve tried doing things like wait until exactly when the minute changes to click the button and then look at the time fields on the frame header to try to match up when stuff happens, but sometimes it&#x27;s just not effective.
 Edit: Feel the need to clarify a bit and defend my ineptitude.. say you are troubleshooting an O365 issue, with something like Outlook.. so you have absolutely no idea what IP the app is talking to because it&#x27;s usually got like 30 TCP sessions out to O365 IPs.

                              <span>Hi,
 I try to configure some shaping on a OPNsense router (virtual) to avoid drops on the next hop, which is located on the WAN interface. 
 Setup:
 [IPerf Server] --- [1 Gbit/s Link]----[LAN - OPNsense Router - WAN] -----[1Gbit/s Link] ------ [Devices with 400M policer]---- [1 Gbit/s Link] ----- [IPerf Server] 
 So I try to upload[1] from first/left IPerf Server, to the other/right IPerf Server but it seems the Device with the 400M policer gets overrun and drops packets.
 So I need to shape all OPNSense outgoing traffic to this device to about 400 Mbit/s.
 Already made some pipe and Rule but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effects.
 Any ideas?
 (Download gets close to 400Mbits)
 Thanks

 Will the latency be increased significantly? What are the other implications?
 Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Greetings, fellow Redditors! We are in the planning phase for a new school site and looking to establish both LAN infrastructure and a video surveillance system.
 It&#x27;s worth noting that the regular network traffic at the new K-12 school site (600 students, 100 staff, 250 Chromebooks, 80 Windows laptops ,couple virtualised Windows Servers, 20 printers, 8 MFC, up to 200 smartphones, PBX with a dozen DECT units only for staffrooms) will primarily consist of internet-bound activities utilizing a 1 Gbps symmetric connection. The majority of data transfers will be directed towards the internet, while a smaller portion will be allocated for local traffic, such as printing tasks and access to a limited number of local resources on the file server, if necessary.
 The proposed video surveillance system will comprise 55 PoE cameras, with each camera potentially requiring up to 10 Mb/s bandwidth to the local recording server (total of 550 Mb/s) and monitoring workstation. As we consider the impact on the LAN, we would appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.
 Switches are planned to be stacked and interconnected in a dozen racks connected to the MDF through 10 Gb/s fiber links.
 I am enclosing a rough rack ports count, which includes a full option (all wall ports connected to switches) and a minimum option (all cables connected to patch panels, but only required ports effectively connected to switches, to lower initial number of required switches).

 We are curious about determining if dedicated appliances are necessary to effectively manage the network load. Your expertise and suggestions are highly valued. Thank you!

                              <span>I moved over in to tech sales a few years ago, so I&#x27;m a bit out of the loop for how things are being done these days. Previously companies I worked for always had physically seperated DMZ environments, using different switches than those in their main data center, and having all the VLANs trunked up to a firewall pair for inspection &amp; routing.
 In this day &amp; age though, where VXLAN ovlerays have become popular, and SD-DC solutions like NSX and ACI are in the mix, I&#x27;ve been wondering as to whether or not DMZ environments have physically converged with the rest of the data center.
 What have you guys been observing? Is physical seperation still a common thing?

                              <span>So I saw a few comments about helpdesk tonight that rankled me a little bit, and make me wonder what the technological or managerial solution is for this.
 The long and short of it is, users shouldn&#x27;t share passwords. 100%. Password sharing is bad, security risk, I get it. I also work for an organization that says I can&#x27;t have 30 minutes of an employee&#x27;s time to set up their new computer with them. I have to hand them their computer in a ready-to-go state so that it is a seamless transition from their previous device to their new one. So despite all of our imaging tools, our ability to deploy software from MECM, I still need user credentials for the final hand-off to achieve leadership&#x27;s requirements.

 How long does your company keep these?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve looked it up left and right on google, but I can&#x27;t find a definitive answer... Apologies in advance.
 I need to know what I need to do to give our help desk guys the ability to join computers to the domain and unjoin them as well. When I&#x27;ve researched it, I seem to get a plethora of answers that revolve around modifying domain root permissions, which I&#x27;d not like touch unless I know exactly what is needed. 
 Apparently, their ability to do so existed at some point before I joined in the company, but it broke shortly before I came onboard.
 There is already an AD group that they are all a member of, but from what I&#x27;ve looked at in AD and our GPs, I can&#x27;t find anything that ever tied them to being able to join/remove. For reference, there is already a GPO that makes them local machine admins of computers in our root/&quot;Workstations&quot; OU. Nothing touching the doman root\Computers container. 
 My best guess is that I need to give them write permissions to the Computers container (and our Workstations OU), so that they have the ability to join/remove, but I don&#x27;t know what needs to be done exactly.
 Any input is incredibly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>For some context I&#x27;m 15 years in to a career as a sysadmin in a specialized industry. So I know my strengths and weaknesses, and well aware I have a long stretch ahead of me, and I&#x27;m not looking forward to it. And it&#x27;s not really about the work, but it also kind of is, in what I&#x27;ll be expected to do if I remain in my current role. I&#x27;ve always gone above and beyond learning about the business around me, and I want to follow my interests. In my situation pay would not be an issue, and hiring managers are positive about me in the role, however I&#x27;m just not sure I have all the required knowledge when it comes to things like R and statistics. A lot of us here have some interesting career paths, this can&#x27;t be that unique and frankly I think it&#x27;s a huge asset to have sysadmin knowledge in a data analyst role. Has anyone else gotten out of sysadmin in to a data analyst role or something similar? What did your path look like?

                              <span>My team manages several kiosk type company PCs that are connected to large format printers. They receive updates via SCCM through the Software Center.
 Updates are made available for 2 months and then automatically applied. We desire that our updates be applied at a specific time but sooner than 2 months.
 It&#x27;s just three machines so right now we have a person that goes around, open Software Center, and initiates all of the updates.
 I&#x27;m wondering if it would be possible to run a scheduled task accomplish this?
 (I know the easiest solution would be to modify the deployment SCCM, however our organization works in silos and powers that be have decided that no machines will automatically update for 2 months.)

Sometimes it&#x27;ll BSOD/Lock up entirely needing a forced restart. Logs aren&#x27;t indicating anything is wrong, and when it does, it&#x27;s usually too generic to narrow down. 
 I&#x27;ve escalated to M.S for support but they want log capture the same week/day of the ticket, which is so difficult because these crashes have been so rare / user specific I can&#x27;t capture them at will. 
 I&#x27;ve had a very bad experience with these things...
 What has been your experience with these devices?

 I&#x27;m trying to do some professional development, skill up and certify predominantly on VMWare based systems.
 The environment I&#x27;m looking to deploy and test and figure out is large and out of scope of what my business needs, but are where I want to go professionally. They don&#x27;t have a test environment suitable for me to test this nor willing to fund one for me to test VMWare Cloud Foundations which has sizable hardware requirements, etc etc. 
 Now while I do understand there is VMWare HOL but they&#x27;re very instance based and strictly guided on what&#x27;s being taught, not a test lab where I can go start to finish which is where I find I learn best. 
 Outside of buying a Host at home, which where I live is expensive to purchase even a crappy HPE DL G8, are there subscription based services where I can pay for a lab environment to test that&#x27;s strictly for learning purposes? Really trying my best to actually follow in a career that I want to go in but getting super hamstrung with what I have available to me.

They want me to do it for no additional pay. I don&#x27;t know how. He works with weird software used for machines in the plant.
 I&#x27;m not going to do it. I don&#x27;t want to work closely with his toxic manager and it&#x27;s a lot of extra work for no additional pay. They won&#x27;t fire me because they don&#x27;t want to pay unemployment. They want me to quit and are being assholes. Can they force me to resign? This is in NY state

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m working on a class project that features a theoretical stock trading startup. The focus of our design is on redundancy and latency. If something fails, we need to be switched within under a second. Each tenth of a second costs the company $100,000. 
 I&#x27;ve been searching to try and find a solution that does two things,
 - Streams changes from the live server to the standby server (two VMWare boxes) with little latency.
 - If the live server fails, the standby comes online in under a second.
 I&#x27;m assuming stock trading companies use some sort of specialized software, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any info that might suggest what that is.
 This thing must exist? Any thoughts or suggestion much appreciated.

                              <span>CEO requested to be able to print from his cellphone. These printers are on the company network and we do not allow personal devices to connect to the company network, only the guest network, for obvious security reasons. We also have the printers locked down, no AirPrint, CloudPrint, etc. for the same security concerns. 
 Since this request came from the CEO of the company, the Director of IT says to set it up for him. Help Desk gets this done, enabling AirPrint and joining his phone to an internal company WiFi network so he can reach the printer. He loves this feature so much that he then directs the IT Director to have this rolled out to all company employees that might want to print to any company printers from their phones.

                              <span>I work as the solo IT person/manager for a SMB (250 employees, 75 PC&#x27;s, 7 different physical locations). They used to outsource their IT to MSP but since hiring me, we are doing away with that. We have some locations that have Sophos firewalls and some that have no firewalls. I want to standardize everything but don&#x27;t particularly want to invest in more Sophos. I don&#x27;t love their product, but don&#x27;t hate it either, just kind of in the middle - unimpressed but it works ok. By the way, I have a good grasp on networking as I&#x27;ve been in the industry 15 years, but I&#x27;m really a jack of all trades and a master of none meaning I&#x27;m not a network engineer so I want something easy to manage. We are lucky to have no on prem servers or anything special, so have a very easy/uncomplicated network topology. Everything is cloud based, SaaS, Azure AD, soft phones, and just desktop PC&#x27;s/laptops and printers. Also no VPN requirement since we don&#x27;t host anything. My requirement is to have something very easy to manage, uncomplicated, yet provide great protection.
 When I replace the Sophos and purchase 7 new firewalls, I&#x27;m looking at the following.
 Palo Alto - Seems to be geared towards enterprise, no doubt one of if not the best in the industry for protection. May be too much to manage 7 of these without network engineer level experience on top of all my other duties?
 Fortinet - Seems to be a great solution, runner up to Palo Alto, maybe cheaper depending on the model. Easier to manage but still plenty of protection?
 Cisco Meraki - Seems to be expensive for what it is, less feature sets, but very easy and reliable. However again we have a simple network so don&#x27;t need many features just something that works. Licensing is a little expensive, and if you don&#x27;t pay up, your firewall stops working.
 So with my requirements and the firewalls I&#x27;m looking at, any recommendations if you were in my shoes?

 Not sure if any of you have been impacted by this Cisco Vedge issue. Boy it is creating quite chaos around here. I work for a large bank and we have multiple site complete down. Seems to be a ticking Time bomb! I have linked the article below from Cisco. Seems like all us lower level IT (myself included) will have to go on site to the affected sites and upload a newer cert as Cisco has deemed that to be the best solution at this time. They don&#x27;t seem to have one created yet but hopefully soon.

                              <span>So, working at terribly ran, family owned SMB, and we have a new IS Manager (third one this year, the ran the 1st one off after 17 years and the 2nd guy didn&#x27;t last a day). He&#x27;s pretty good in most respects, but is definitely on the side of the owners of the company when it comes to what he focuses on and how he chooses to resolve things.
 Well, recently, I and the rest of the department- and soon all departments- have been asked to provide all my work account passwords- not vendor accounts, domain admin accounts, server passwords, etc. That&#x27;s all already in a KeePass database that the owners have access too. No, now they want to be able to log in to any account at the company &quot;in case something happens.&quot; In other words- they want us to store every user&#x27;s password where it&#x27;s available for them. Again, the framing is &quot;in case something happens.&quot;
 ​
 Currently- I think they&#x27;re afraid of losing knowledge/access, because they sense they&#x27;ve got 1.5 of my 2 feet out the door already, and the IS Manager/my Jr. Sysadmin are not quite ready to handle everything I do. Or, it could be due to the numerous other major players that have left the company in the past 2-3 years. Either way, it feels like a kneejerk reaction more than someone trying to make sure disaster recovery controls are in place.
 Color me stupid, maybe- but is this not illegal, even if they own the company and thus the accounts?
 At the very least, am I right in feeling like I need to get the fuck out of here before the owner uses my admin account to delete somebody&#x27;s email or something else illegal?

 Basically they pay me max 8hours for one day a week, but management told me I must check tickets daily and send them to someone who can handle since I am not there... is this normal in IT?

                              <span>Hi Sysadmin
 I have run across a need to setup a mailing list with external and internal users for communication with our logistics company and another supplier. The problem is, if we manage the Distribution list and It is replied to by an external user on the list, one of the business won&#x27;t receive it if they are running strict filter settings on their mail security system due to it not passing SFP. If we all run different mailing lists it makes for a struggle with keeping associated emails in the same thread when replying and those lists will get out of date and key people may not be properly informed. 
 Say we Have &quot;US Corp&quot;, &quot;Corp A&quot; &amp; &quot;Corp B&quot;
 if the distribution list that everyone uses is managed by &quot;US Corp&quot; ([List@USCorp.com](mailto:List@USCorp.com)) 
 an employee at Corp A sends …</span>

 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/set-password-to-never-expire?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide
 ​
 ​
 Problem is this line doesn&#x27;t work
 To set the passwords of all users in the organization so that they expire, use the following cmdlet:
 ​
 PowerShell
 ​
 Copy
 Get-MGuser -All | Update-MgUser -PasswordPolicies None -PassThru
 ​
 it says the pipeline has been stopped, input object has full value for input object.userID
 ​
 Any idea how to is it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not bashing this guy or anything. I&#x27;m far from a perfect employee and way too new to the job to be a good sysadmin. Its just bizarre and something that I notice a lot. 
 Yesterday, my coworker approached the team with a server &quot;issue&quot; he found on one of our monitoring programs and proposed a potential solution.
 Here&#x27;s the thing:
 I found this issue back in March. Brought it to my team&#x27;s attention, investigated it and documented my findings. Then coordinated with the networking team to discuss resolving it. 
 We found that the &quot;issue&quot; has literally zero impact on performance, and the act of resolving it would require bringing down the server&#x27;s application. And my bosses boss said that he didn&#x27;t think that tradeoff was worth it. Bringing down an important application for several hours to &quot;fix&quot; something that doesn&#x27;t affect the server or the application, whose only impact is a very occasional alert on a monitoring program. 
 The ultimate resolution was to leave it as-is. 
 So I told my coworker that, showed him my work, and forwarded him the email where everyone agreed that it was a non-issue. 
 But apparently that wasn&#x27;t good enough, and he proceeded to bring the application down on his own, with no conferring with the team, against the wishes of everyone else who already worked on the problem, to perform the &quot;fix&quot;. 
 I swear, this guy sometimes just does things for the only reason of creating the appearance that he&#x27;s &quot;fixing&quot; problems that aren&#x27;t actually there.
 We haven&#x27;t had our daily meeting yet so no one has discussed his decision to do this on his own yet. So we&#x27;ll see how that goes. But geez. 
 He otherwise does good work, and I&#x27;m not casting stones because I have my faults too. So I just find it odd that he chooses to do things like this.

                              <span>Hello. I am a total noob for tape backups and am a little lost here. I would appreciate any advice.
 I have been working in tech for a long time and manage a lot of infrastructure, but I have never needed to back something up to tape. Currently I work at a research institute and we have to keep data for a very long time, and we want to fill up a fire safe with a bunch of tapes for this reason.
 My data environment is a mix of offline hard drives, NAS, and some compute clusters.
 My problem is I do not really know what to do here. Dell keep trying to get me to buy massive units that will fill up my racks and store a bunch of tapes inside them as a managed system, but all I need is a way to write to the tapes and then remove the tapes to the safe. I think to this end I can either get an external tape drive, or a small server with a tape drive in it so everyone relevant can access? Am I correct here that I dont need any substantial hardware.
 Secondly they keep asking me about software, what I am going to use to write the tapes for storage. Having looked in to it it seems it is not so simple as drag and drop, and I need a software package to write the data to the tapes. My question here is, does anyone have recommendations for a lightweight software program I can use in an enterprise environment for this? I dont need anything comprehensive just occasional writing to single, unmanaged tapes.
 Apologies if these are silly questions. I have been struggling to find simple directions for what I need to purchase.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins. I am currently serving the the US Marines as a sysamin. I am thinking of transitioning to the civilian sector, kinda done with military lifestyle and want to be with my family. I have reservations for finding a quality salary to match the pay and benefits I have now.
 I&#x27;ve been in the field for about 7 years but realistically, IT only fills like 30-40 of my time at work. Mostly AD user management, vm management, help desk services and network management. I feel like my skill set is too wide and I can&#x27;t command a high salary for a senior sysadmin or project manager.
 If I don&#x27;t transition, I&#x27;ll end up being forced into more personnel management which is not what I want to do. I want to remain technical.
 I just graduated in the fall with a BS in CompSci and have Sec+. Planning on attaining CCNA in a few weeks. 
 I just feel like I don&#x27;t know enough or be competent enough to comfortably transition. Sorry for the ramble, coming to the end of a 24 duty post and I&#x27;m a little tired.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m wondering how many company has moved to Windows 11. I have pressure from my boss to start moving computer to W11 (although not even 25% of my fleet support it and they won&#x27;t replace the computer). They say everyone has moved to it while I&#x27;m seeing only Windows 10 everywhere I look except maybe one or two place. Latest survey I saw online was 20% computers are now on W11, but that include consumer and since they are sold with W11, it&#x27;s normal this number grow.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I hope you&#x27;re all doing well. I recently got a new server for setting up our own virtual environment, moving away from using an MSP and ESXi. We opted for some Dell servers, nothing too fancy since we&#x27;ll only be running about 3 or maybe 4 Windows VMs.
 Here&#x27;s the thing: I&#x27;ve been going through the Dell documentation, trying to understand how to set up BitLocker on this server. I&#x27;ve used BitLocker before on laptops and old servers, where it would prompt for the key or passphrase upon reboot. But now, it seems like because this server has a TPM 2.0 chip, that might not be necessary?
 I&#x27;ve come across conflicting guides and articles from Dell, so I&#x27;m feeling a bit confused. Our server has two drives: one for the OS and another for data storage (a few 2TB drives). When I go to manage BitLocker, I have the option to save the recovery key to a file or print it. So, I saved the key on a USB drive and made additional backups on OneDrive, our NAS, and SaaS backup. For now, I&#x27;ve only enabled BitLocker on the OS drive using the &quot;used space only&quot; option since it&#x27;s currently empty.
 But here&#x27;s the weird part: after rebooting, it didn&#x27;t ask for the key. Many of the guides I&#x27;ve found talk about selecting the TPM module and setting up auto-unlock options, but my server just boots up without any prompts. I&#x27;m assuming that for the second drive, I can simply right-click it and enable BitLocker in the same way.
 Is this normal behavior with a server that has a TPM chip? Does it automatically unlock BitLocker? To be honest, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping for, especially since I plan to move to remote management soon (if it&#x27;s allowed). I want things to be easy during patching nights and remote maintenance.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any insights or clarification on this matter. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I’ve been asked to look at this as an alternative to our Horizon on prem setup.
 I’m a bit dubious about the maintenance of the BYOL offering, but otherwise it looks like it can do the job.
 Does anyone have experience with it for 200 users?

 We got a bad drive in from Seagate fresh out of the box with 5000 bad sectors, sending it back, but when we checked the drive with Seatools I noticed it was reporting 54hrs of use. Is this just their burn-in test time, or may this drive actually have seen use and then been resold by Amazon after a prior return?

 Sometimes when I refresh they disappear, but then seemingly reappear at random.

                              <span>Hello there, 
 Recently have enforced MFA (we work exclusives with the MS ecosystem and use AWS for our VM&#x27;s ) across the business with some conational access rules set up too. BUT there seems to be a small issue for WFH users.
 There OneDrive/SharePoint sync need to be resigned in every 4 hours ( that&#x27;s the frequency sign in for wfh users) and users keep forgetting and then there work wont sync up with our db. that is integrated with MS cloud storage 
 Yes this is a user issue but I need to make this easier for users, is there a way OneDrive can stay signed in on the users device but ever other app related to MS still needs the MFA input? Is there any addition security risk with this as well?
 Thanks, 
 A fellow lone sysadmin

                              <span>Hi All
 Like others, we were caught out by the CVE-2023-23397 vulnerability and inability to quickly get devices patched. We ended up sending an update command to devices via ConnectWise but walked away from the experience acknowledging the Semi-Annual Channel (and our current configuration) doesn’t get security updates quickly enough. 
 We are keen to get on the Servicing profiles in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin centre but we have some business software that integrates with Office, installing Add-ins and therefor the Software company only support the Semi-annual channel to give them a decent lead time on fixing new Office features - I’m presuming their devs are on the Monthly channel.
 My questions are:
 Is there an intention for MS to bring other channels into servicing profiles? And if so, any ideas on when that will be?
 What is the best strategy on keeping the Semi-Annual Channel safely patched. We are a Hybrid org slowly migrating devices to Intune and we are about to stand-up AutoPatch.
 Thanks!

 after we install May Windows update, we will need to
  
Run command to copy Code Integrity Boot Policy to EFI partition
  
​
  
Change the registry
  
​
  
Restart the device
  
​
  
Wait 5 minutes and restart the device again
  
​
  Wait at least 5 minutes and the restart the device again Important: An additional restart is required to fully initialize the revocation protections. 
 ​
 what&#x27;s supposed to happen during the 5 minutes?
 ​
 Maybe it needs to be online to retrieve something? Or maybe it&#x27;s to wait for a delayed start service?

 we are currently facing a flood of alert from MDE - did Microsoft maybe change some kind of detection? 
 Is anyone else facing this?

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 Previously on W10 I could see the RSAT tools and run them under my admin account, however, after upgrading to W11, I can no longer see the shortcuts.
 I have checked there installed and if I log on as an admin there exactly where they should be and work just fine.
 ​
 Is there a way to make the shortcuts appear on a non-admin account or am I missing something obvious?
 ​
 ​
 EDIT# I found a solution that works, essentially creating or copying the shortcuts shown to admins will allow non-admin users to run those tools as an admin or other user as usual.
 Shortcuts located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools by default.

 The only workaround I&#x27;ve found so far is to crash Edge and re-launch almost immediately which is fine until you open a new instance of Edge (regular or InPrivate) before it happens again. 
 Appears that users affected are running the same build as those without issues (113.0.1774.35)
 Anyone have any ideas? Been having to install Chrome as a temporary workaround for the time being...

 When we try open Outlook from Azure Virtual Desktop, it&#x27;s like we should have the credential pop up appears in the screen but we don&#x27;t have it and finaly we are not able to open Outlook.
 It seems to be a FSLOGIX issue because outlook is opened from multi session VM.
 We are using Hybrid configuration (all computers and servers are Hybrid ADJoin), and we have 2 hosts (vm) fro Azure Virtual Desktop that are in Azure AD Registered(they are synchronize by our AdConnect server). 
 Some advices on my situation?

 Background info:
  
O365/Azure/Microsoft:
  
we have a handful of basic licenses for system email addresses for use in another software application (so that sending from that software comes from a generic address rather than a specific person.
 also have the normal licensed user accounts and email addresses
 currently all are required to do regular password changes, MFA is on.
 
 Other Application: 
 &quot;System Emails&quot; must be configured for ANYONE sending from that software - so, we have both individual accounts in as &#x27;system emails&#x27; as well as the generic &#x27;from the software&#x27; emails.
 I set up app passwords for the generic address emails - but it keeps stopping at the Microsoft password entry screen.
 
 
We have been stuck in a holding pattern - each side is sending me to the other for resolution :) I&#x27;d just like to know if anyone here has had luck recently setting up an App Password and using it somewhere - without actually needing to type a password? 
 OR - any suggestions as to ways to still be &#x27;secure&#x27; but not have the hassle of sharing a password for this generic email (we are really cracking down on how many sticky notes or passwords written on whiteboards). ;) 
 Was thinking separate password policy for those emails with an extremely long character requirement and no expiration?

 What do i have to configure in forefront of issuing a certificate with dns-01 challenge, besides the EAB-Keys and the API-Token which i already got to work?
 Do i need to have other DNS-Records configured, besides the A-Record for the subdomain?

                              <span>So I’ve run into a bit of an issue and it’s raised some questions. It was brought to my attention that one of our facilities’ wifi network had run out of IP addresses. Upon investigation, I found a bunch of MAC addresses that didn’t register to a vendor. I checked the firewall and each address had traffic indicative of an Apple device. (Apple Maps, ICloud, FB, etc). 
 There were roughly 26 different MAC addresses with similar traffic, each reserving a different IP via DHCP. I then checked the wireless controller, and found only 1 iPhone was actively connected. This was during normal working hours. 
 Did this 1 iPhone reserve 26 different IPs? Apple mentions the MAC address changes daily when “Private Wi-Fi Address” is enabled, does it also change when hopping from one access point to another under the same SSID? Did this individual leave a trail of DHCP reservations everywhere he walked in the facility, hopping from AP to AP? 
 Has anybody else dealt with this?

                              <span>Hi there
 We have a new network provider who has sold us business WAN connections in the form of L3 links across their network (inside our own vrf). I need to establish branch-to-DC connections across this provider network. I was wondering if it was worthwhile tunneling (GRE or vxlan?) our traffic across rather than just BGP peering in on both sides and routing through. From a privacy or complexity standpoint is there anything to be gained?
 I know the correct way to do it is most likely is a gateway/VPN/SDWAN type setup but that&#x27;s out of budget for now. What we have is L3 switches at both ends (Aruba CX).
 I&#x27;ve mostly only dealt with dark fibre and L2 provider networks and OSPF routing, just wanted to get opinions before deploying something that might cause headaches later...

On the core vlans 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 are configured. The address of the core is 10.1.2.10, each vlan on the core has an IP assigned 10.1.2.10, 10.1.3.1, 10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1. The default gateway on each vlan as defined on the core is 10.1.2.1(port 3 on firewall). DHCP is handled on a server on the 2 subnet 10.1.2.20. The default gateway for e…</span>

 The company that I work for is decommissioning an AnyConnect VPN Portal and as of result I need to remove the soon-to-be legacy portal from the AnyConnect Agent from all end-user. Initially, I thought if I take the existing XML File config and remove the legacy Portal from the Server List. then upload it back into my AnyConnect Configuration in FMC that would remove the portal name as an aviavable option for users to see, however, it still shows up.... Does anyone know how I would go about removing a VPN portal from an AnyConnect Client for all users? Is there something that I am perhaps missing? Do I need to create some form of a XML negate statement?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a difficult time finding an answer to this SR-IOV question.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a hypervisor and create 8 VFs (Virtual Functions) on a 10G NIC, then attach one VF to one VM - 7 VFs are not used.
 Does the total throughput capacity get split up evenly across all VFs - so you would get 1/8 of the total throughput capacity of the NIC per VF, or does one VF have all of the NIC&#x27;s available bandwidth until more VFs are attached to VMs? Does this differ between driver configurations?
 I&#x27;m asking these questions because I saw someone bonding VFs together, and I was wondering if it was because of this or not.
 If anyone knows the answer to this, could you please direct me towards some reading information about it?

                              <span>Hello, thank you for reading. 
 Here&#x27;s the scenario we are dealing with: 
 We have a new building we need to extend our network to. We cannot reach this building with a microwave or fiber, so we purchased a leased line and created an IPsec VPN tunnel from Building A to Remote Building (Building B).
 The end goal of this project is to have Building B fully connected to our network, able to access wireless, fileshares, voip, etc.
 Typically, when we deploy a new building, we simply extend vlans to the building over fiber or microwave. Basically create the Vlan/IRB on the core, and trunk it to where it needs to go. 
 There are a few problems here, one of them being I have no control or say over what is configured on the firewall, and the person who deploys our firewall is old, stubborn, and very hard to work with. That being said, his VPN Tunnel works just not how I need it to.
 Here&#x27;s the other problem: His tunnel provides us with a single LAN. Say 10.10.10.1/24 . We are only able to configure a single VLAN based off this, and the remote location needs roughly 10 VLANs. I have asked him to join me in a call with Cisco to see if we can figure out a solution and he says he doesn&#x27;t have time. 
 So yes I know you cannot help me in dealing with this difficult Person , but I was hoping someone could lend some best practice, tips, or advice. I have a strong feeling there must be a simpler way of extending a network, however my experience is limited.
 If you need any clarity on anything, feel free to ask. Thank you

                              <span>So I have a Draytek 2866 that about 5 people connect to using SSL VPN but one of those five uses Three (UK 5G network) broadband as the person&#x27;s remote and traditional broadband is not an option. Except for that one user, everybody else can connect using SSL VPN and work just fine. For that user, we have IPSec over L2TP setup and that works fine, but we want to move over to SSL VPN completely but the SSL VPN connection on that laptop is dropping packets. We isolated it to be because of the ISP but the funny thing is that the same ISP on the same laptop seems to work with GlobalProtect, PulseSecure &amp; CiscoAnyConnect - all running SSL VPNs so why does the Draytek Smart VPN client not work with SSL?
 I&#x27;ve meddled around with the MTU on both the laptop and the mss value on the draytek but neither of them have made a difference. Appreciate your comments.

                              <span>Hi,
 First of all, here is the CV I&#x27;m looking for advice on.
 I tried posting this on r/ITCareerQuestions but the post just ended up getting downvoted (no idea why) so thought I&#x27;d try my luck here instead.
 So I&#x27;m 33 years old and have been in IT since I was 18. I had a couple of random jobs before that but this is more or less all I&#x27;ve ever known. I started at 1st line (Service Desk) and progressed to 2nd line support, then finally to 3rd line (Network Engineer) in 2017. Most of my time is spent tidying network cabinets, patching cables in at the data centre, installing / replacing customer hardware, carrying out surveys, troubleshooting slowness tickets, etc.
 I enjoy my job but I feel like my time to fly the nest is long overdue - there&#x27;s no chance of promotion anytime soon and I&#x27;m not …</span>

                              <span>Struggling to find simple documentation on the DC site setup for viptela sd-wan redundancy. At a DC site it says both routers need to be on the same site ID which makes sense, what I don&#x27;t get is how are they redundant? Is there no vrrp or BGP peering between the two routers? Is the redundancy purely based on the fact they have the same site ID? And they use the vSmart for redundancy?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a newb to the public IP realm, so forgive my ignorance here. My org bought a IP range and we are trying to set up multihoming BGP with two ISPs. We went into testing, and things just didn&#x27;t work. A significant portion of the internet just wasn&#x27;t available. We could easily reach and resolve from all of the public DNS providers we tried, but basic web browsing was very hit and miss. We rolled back, and upon troubleshooting it was found that another AS is actively advertising our IP range. The name of the org is pretty vague and generic, and I can&#x27;t find anything on them by searching. I am trying to find if there is a public database of AS holders with contact info, kind of like with domain names. Does that exist? What else can we try?

In the rare event that I do find a chassis, I&#x27;m replacing it with a stack or distribution/aggregation sets. I&#x27;m wondering if this is a midwest thing or if other people are seeing the same thing.

                              <span>1) The question is i’m running some wifi stuff on some dicey electricity so i want to protect it should i be getting a voltage regulator and a ups? Or would a ups be good enough
 2) And if i use them both what is the way to do that plug in the ups and then the voltage regulator or vice verca?
 Also the thing that makes the electricity dicey is it’s go out a lot. Lot’s of fluctuations but also the standard here is 120V and we’re receiving 90V yes i know this is a bigger issue that needs to be fixed
 3) But with the 90V is that enough input for the regulator and ups to work? Or is there a required minimum input 
 4) Also do these devices require the plugs they use to be grounded for them to work or is a hot and neutral good enough? 
 https://www.mercadolibre.com.mx/regulador-de-voltaje-koblenz-rs-1410-1410va-entrada-y-salida-de-120v-negro/p/MLM17328307
 This is the regulator i want to buy, i returned it because it wasn’t working and then realized after it could have been because the voltage was so low or because the plug wasn’t grounded. I hope the link helps with the questions sorry it’s in Spanish.
 Hope someone can help i’m not getting that far with google 👍

                              <span>Yes I understand all the interference and other issues that may arise when on 40MHz and I also understand the recommended non-overlapping channels that should be used are 1, 6, &amp; 11. It&#x27;s my understanding that for 20MHz you must use 1, 6, &amp; 11 because they do not overlap.
 But if I simply want to test out 40MHz for learning purposes, pretty much every link just repeats using 1, 6, &amp; 11 but aren&#x27;t those 20MHz channels?
 My understanding (which may be wrong), that on 802.11n OFDM Channels 3, 9, &amp; 13 are the 40MHz channels.
 I also think I understand that channels 3, 9, and 13 do overlap other channels but that can&#x27;t be avoided since they are 40MHz in width.
 So with all that being said, is it realistic to use, let&#x27;s say channel 9, for testing? To gain some real-world expectations while doing bandwidth tests on that channel. With the assumption that there is weak and extremely limited interference from other wifi signals.
 Right now just in testing the 40MHz channel width does yield more bandwidth than when using 20MHz as expected but I wanted to make sure my test was realistic??
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am trying to get a multipoint layer 2 service to come up between an ASR 920 and an ASR 9006. The ASR 9006 is new to me, I have several 920s and I have no issues with doing MPLS layer 2 circuits between those. I thought I had everything configured correct but I cannot get the l2 virtual circuit to come up.
 ​
 sh mpls l2transport vc Local intf Local circuit Dest address VC ID Status ------------- -------------------------- --------------- ---------- ---------- VFI vc-1 \ vfi 10.0.11.19 1106 DOWN 
 ​
 Here is the configuration for the 920 IOS XE side:
 bridge-domain 1106 l2 vfi vc-1 manual vpn id 1106 bridge-domain 1106 neighbor 10.0.11.19 encapsulation mpls ! 
 ​
 The 9006 IOS XR side:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1/0 description vc-1 transceiver permit pid all l2transport ! ! interface Loopback0 ipv4 address 10.0.11.19 255.255.255.255 ! l2vpn bridge group vc-1 bridge-domain vc-1 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1/0 ! vfi 1106 neighbor 10.0.11.28 pw-id 1106 ! ! routed interface BVI1106 ! ! ! ! mpls ldp log neighbor graceful-restart session-protection ! nsr graceful-restart router-id 10.0.11.19 session protection interface BVI28 ! ! 
 ​
 I am not a MPLS expert by any means but it looks like LDP is working:
 Peer LDP Identifier: 10.0.11.28:0 TCP connection: 10.0.11.28:47083 - 10.0.11.19:646 Graceful Restart: Yes (Reconnect Timeout: 120 sec, Recovery: 0 sec) Session Holdtime: 180 sec State: Oper; Msgs sent/rcvd: 199/198; Downstream-Unsolicited Up time: 00:39:26 
 Both sides of the l2 vc are up and have traffic trying to reach each other. I have no idea where I am going wrong at this point.

                              <span>Hello,
 For those of you who rely on a source of truth (SOT) for network automation, how do you ensure that the SOT remains synchronized with the network? There are various methods to achieve this, and I am interested in discussing different approaches and what has worked well versus what hasn&#x27;t.
 I will be deploying Nautobot soon, and once Nautobot is up and running, my next challenge will be to ensure that it is the actual SOT. We have an operations team who make changes regularly to the devices, so this will be a huge problem.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m replacing a Cisco 7606 as the BGP table is getting full. I don&#x27;t have any fancy things running. Just very simple BGP / OSPF.
 I already purchased a Juniper MX204 for the routing. Now I need to have a switch to get me some additional ports as the MX204 only has just a couple (something that was easy on the Cisco 7600 with blades).
 I&#x27;m going the get the switch as refurbish. I just need port density, 48SFP+ and some additional higher speed QSFP). For now I have narrowed it down to:
  
Juniper QFX5100-48S (or even QFX5110-48S)
 Cisco N3K-C3172PQ-XL
 
 Seem to be almost the same. My question does any of either platform going to give me problems regarding licenses? I will not have any license when I buy these boxes. But would like to be able to software update them if needed (assuming I have the software).
 Any other comments on why to choose one over the other?

                              <span>So far in your experience what is the best fibre internet provider you&#x27;ve used?
 I am using Virgin&#x27;s fake Fibre which give&#x27;s us a Gbit but the router they have given us can&#x27;t port forward and the software fix is 2 months away. This is useless since we have servers internal in which we need to port forward.
 We also have a TalkTalk line which we got installed recently. We changed from a Dynamic to a Static IP yesterday but apparently a range of Static IPs are down for TalkTalk atm.
 Is it me or are UK Internet providers getting more and more flaky. 2 Months for a software fix so I can port forward!!! Is a joke. This is the most basic of tasks that routers have been able to do for decades.
 So while our TalkTalk FTTP line is now getting converted back to a dynamic IP so we can at least use it, since the whole line is down. It will then have to be converted back to a Static IP once the issue is resolved probably causing another 24 hour of down time while the IP gets provisioned.
 What are the best UK 1Gbit/Fibre providers you&#x27;ve used? or are currently using?
 Thanks.

Does the client need to first specify their ip address in some way to the server so the server knows where to send information? And what if I suddenly use a VPN while on the application, how would the server then know to send packets to that VPN server?

                              <span>Noob question here.. I have access to vmanager and noticed under controllers all 3 vmanage, vbond and vsmart do not have device templates assigned.
 I am comfortable with assigning to the edges but am wondering if it&#x27;s required on the controllers to add features etc or will they operate fine without templates?

                              <span>In our upcoming school, which is low on budget, we want to offer basic security services to any LAN user, and additionally for students, a web filtering an monitoring facility (keyword catching), which could be served by an appliance such as Smoothwall.
 We&#x27;re wondering if we can save some money avoiding the yearly cost of a NGFW license bundled to our next potential firewall (Sonicwall or Fortigate), since some hardening can be implemented through good policies adoption, for instance, implementing restrictions through VLANs, GPOs (Group Policy Objects), and application executions whitelisting, which are effective ways to enhance network security without relying on expensive NGFW licenses.
 VLANs: VLANs can be used to isolate different types of traffic, such as guest traffic or IoT devices, from the rest of the network. By creating separate VLANs for different types of traffic, network administrators can apply different security policies to each VLAN to restrict access to sensitive resources and prevent lateral movement between VLANs.
 GPOs: Group Policy Objects can be used to enforce security policies on Windows endpoints. GPOs can be used to restrict access to specific applications, block USB devices, disable unnecessary services, and enable advanced security features such as Windows Defender Firewall and BitLocker.
 Application executions whitelisting: Application executions whitelisting is a security practice that allows only trusted applications to run on a system, while blocking all other applications. This can be done by creating a whitelist of approved applications and preventing any other applications from running. This can help to prevent the execution of malicious software and limit the attack surface of the system.
 Adopting this strategy, one could achieve the same effect as using an NGFW license, but with a more targeted tool for the education world at the same cost.
 Your thoughts?

                              <span>Connecting my first SAN, a dual-controller NVME unit. Since I have dual controllers for high availability, was considering redundant switches too. But to extend this thought, I would need dual connections from every server (1 to each switch) for storage at least. 
 Question 1: For those running dual controller SAN, how far do you extend the redundancy on the storage network side? Do you have both controllers plugged into the same switch? Separate switches? Are servers plugged into both switches? What about regular network for the servers--is it senseless to have redundancy on storage network but not for regular LAN traffic for the servers?
 Question 2: How important is it to separate SAN traffic from other network traffic? VLANs sufficient or are separate switches recommended?
 Question 3: I assume using redundant switches effectively reduces my performance potential as it cuts link aggregation potential in half. True? Worth it in your opinion? 
 Thanks

                              <span>These are both BT descriptors. My understanding is that Etherway is a physical fibre connection between a customer site and nearest BT node.
 An Etherflow is a virtual circuit on top of Etherway?
 If someone could provide some more background on this, I&#x27;d be appreciative. Or if you could point me towards a relevant resource. Thank you.

I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it seems that L3 Roaming is somehow interfering with the VPN. The thing is I&#x27;m a little unsure of what L3 Roaming even does. It seems that it makes me able to move between VLANs, which is not something we do at all. We have some different VLANs depending on what the device is (Native, Guest, Sonos, Security Cameras, etc), and we need these to talk together, but not move from one VLAN to another. With these requirements is L3 roaming necessary? All help is much appreciated!

                              <span>There should be an easy solution to this but as I am no network engineer, here we are.
 I have 16 blade servers in a C7000 Bladesystem chassis. Each blade is identical, with two 10gbe NICs each.
 Each blade has one NIC connected to an external network via a 1GBe switch (slow, but only used for the remote desktop). The second nic is connected to the internal private network with no internet uplink. In the C7000, this is implemented as a physical backplane that allows the interconnect between blades - regardless in the OS this is just a second NIC with no internet access.
 Nic 1 is on 10.66.110.xxx connected to the wider network via the switch. Nic2 is on the private internal network 10.0.0.xxx.
 Currently, if I copy a file from server 1 to server 2, it goes over nic 1 and therefore is throttled to 1GBe by the switch. If I connect from server 2 to server 1 via its internal ip address (ie windows file explorer opened to the network location 10.0.0.1 from server 2) then copy a file to a local directory, it still goes over the nic 1 network via the switch.
 I would obviously love to only have file transfer to occur over the direct connection and get the full 10gbe bandwidth. I should note this is windows server 2019.
 Any help would be appreciated!

 First, I&#x27;ll go back to last September and the first incident. At the first site (that I&#x27;ll call Site A) the old scheduling panels were being swapped out. The on-site tech reported that he had seen most of them come up, but after he finished only 3 or 4 of the 15 panels were on. (I&#x27;m summarizing the important points here, there were other attempts and delays that I don&#x27;t recall all of, and didn&#x27;t lead to a solution, so these are just the important steps.) Ports showed no link and no PoE draw. He unplugged a few and plugged back in. Nothing. Swapped patch cable. Also nothing. Then he pulled a panel off the wall and ran a …</span>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the active exploitation of CVE-2023-27350. This vulnerability occurs in certain versions of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF and enables an unauthenticated actor to execute malicious code remotely without credentials. PaperCut released a patch in March 2023.
According to FBI observed information, malicious actors exploited CVE-2023-27350 beginning in mid-April 2023 and continuing through the present. In early May 2023, also according to FBI information, a group self-identifying as the Bl00dy Ransomware Gang attempted to exploit vulnerable PaperCut servers against the Education Facilities Subsector.

                              <span>20 year IT vet here, currently cloud engineer. I always strive to keep learning and sharpen skills, but I must admit with the arrival of ChatGPT, Bing AI, upcoming Copilot to name a few I’ve taken a motivation hit to keep learning.
 I planned a few Azure certs this year in addition to going back to school for a bachelors in comp science or cybersecurity.
 My thought is, why should I keep pushing myself if everything is about to be at my fingertips? Also any low skilled person can soon punch in a bunch of prompts and generate required outputs to complete higher level tasks?
 I dont know. I am struggling.

 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name&#x3D;CVE-2023-32233
  
In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled.

                              <span>So I let my boss know in January that I was going to take 8 weeks of paternity leave starting in July. He said no problem and that they would just have to figure out support since I&#x27;m the only tech for my site.
 Fast forward to the last couple weeks. My boss asked if it would be willing to do half the time off and half the time 100 percent remote. I said it wouldn&#x27;t be ideal because It could turn into a lot of me running back into the office so I said I would be willing to help if they were in Jam
 He came back to me this week and said that his boss said absolutely not to working from home and that he expects us to be in the office 5 days a week. 
 Now they are talking about hiring a contractor for when I am out and want me to train them before I leave but the kicker is they want our local operations team to pay for the contrator cost. Which I know they won&#x27;t do because the are on strict hiring freeze. 
 My boss is a very nice guy but this whole situation has made me a little sour. It feels like everytime he talks to me about it you can tell they aren&#x27;t happy about it.
 I stated that 90 percent of our job can be done from home. I just did a whole network and server refresh this year and I stated someone locally should be able to help with troubleshooting over the phone 
 Sorry for the rant. Just don&#x27;t know how to approach this going forward. Considering I&#x27;m entitled to these leave benefits.

                              <span>Worked a couple of years 100% remote, and always produced. Have always produced my whole career. 
 Anyway, we started back in a 3 day per week in office hybrid situation this year. The last couple of months my boss is seemingly micromanaging me as far as &quot;time in seat&quot;. 
 He has commented a couple of times on how I took longer than 15 min on a break or left early (we are talking 10 min once) 
 I&#x27;m on salary I don&#x27;t clock in and out. 
 Just today, I spent 3 hours straight on a call with a colleague fixing a critical issue. After this call, I went to the restroom and then I went 3 min away to the local coffee shop and got a coffee, and then came back. 
 We all get a 15 min break in the morning and one in afternoon. Sure, if you were clock watching I bet it took 20-25 min total this time. But really? This is something that is not really ever cared about, even during this year back, and now just recently it has become a large issue seemingly. 
 Anyone experience this when coming back in or is it a sign that I might be on the way out? My performance has been normal and I always get all projects completed. It just almost seems like they are dealing with something &quot;else&quot; and are pissed off, and trying to take it out on me or something.

                              <span>One year ago today i accepted the offer with my company. In that time, I didn’t know if I was going to survive and make it to this point. 
 I remember feeling like I wasn’t good enough for this role. I remember running into my first issue that I didn’t know how to fix, to which I thought was a major fuck up at the time and turning towards Reddit and this sub for help. At that moment I was welcomed with hella comments that were filled with both help and encouraging words (and the few negative, but they were outweighed by the positive). Shit, even my name “sadmin” was a play on how down bad I was at the time, most people would think it would stand for “system admin” when in reality I named it that with the “S” standing for “sad” (get it? sad-min, sad admin) haha.
 I say this to say, thank you all for the help and advice over the past year, thanks for every post with every new vulnerability, every comment mentioning a fix to an issue, and even every rant that helped solidify the fact that “it’s not just me” lol. All in all, I love and am grateful for this subreddit!

                              <span>So today I was given some exciting news from the CIO...
 I will be moving from my Sys Admin role to a Systems Architect.
 This has been discussed for a few weeks now on and off since I am primarily working on projects that fall under that title as is, but its nice to finally have the title.
 I don&#x27;t have a lot of people in my life to really spread news like this around, so my fellow redditors and admins alike, I choose to share it with yall and my excitement!
 Time to celebrate with lunch!

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

 Have you ran DaaS? Any big downsides I should be aware of from an IT Head perspective?

                              <span>Does you know anyone that has experiacne with setting up kiosk versions of chrome? I&#x27;m trying to create a small script that asks if the production page needs to be displayed in spanish. I&#x27;ve thrown all the flags I can think off and find, but the page still displays in english. 
 Start-Process -FilePath &quot;C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe&quot; -ArgumentList &quot;--kiosk&quot;, &quot; http://serername/APPLICATION/shopfloor.php?terminal&#x3D;$env:COMPUTERNAME&quot;, &quot;--translate&quot;, &quot;--disable-pinch&quot;, &quot;--overscroll-history-navigation&#x3D;0&quot;, &quot;--translate-service-url&#x3D;https://translate.google.com&quot;
 i have also used other flags as well: &quot;--translate-service-url&#x3D;https://translate.google.com&quot; &quot;--lang-es&quot; &quot;--translate-foreign-language&quot;
 This will be part of a solution to minimize hardware requietments for window 10 based systems. Basically turning them into production kiosks while supressing thnormal windows shell.

                              <span>I am in need of a NIST 800-88 erasure software that does not consume licenses. I currently use DBAN, but it does not meet NIST 800-88 Standards. The drives get reused/sold and consumable licenses make that bad business. 
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Crafting this query is hard as results focus on the TTL of records in the DNS server 
 Where does one go to manage the DNS recursive cache?
 The trouble is the delay for discovery of new records that have been added on a site or subdomain for a partner and the time for cache expiration is hard to find or change.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 First post and my native language isn&#x27;t english.
 Since some months we have &quot;problems with cabled(1)&quot; internet &amp; &quot;Wifi(2)&quot; in our enterprise buildings.
  
The problems with cabled internet is solved with disabling Mac Passthrough option in BIOS. Because we use Port replicators that gave issues. (just mentioning this because maybe it helps with the main problem).
 The Wifi problem - Almost no internet at our buildings (250Kbps to 2.5Mbps), when working from home no problem: 
 Only on certain laptops. 
 Working laptop has between 80Mbps-100Mbps
 followed this whole guide: https://www.thetechwire.com/internet-slow-on-one-computer-but-fast-on-another/
 Compared laptop(s) with another laptop and everything is the same(drivers/updates/hardware/... .
 Took the Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 Intern WLAN 2400 Mbit/s from a &quot;working&quot; laptop to a not working laptop. Issue remains.
 Switched the power plan to balanced (i gained 2-3Mbps).
 The Wifi isn&#x27;t REALLY bad at some places. When the faulty laptop connects to AP1 you can have 3.5MBps and when the laptop connects on AP2 it can only have 250Kbps.
 It doesn&#x27;t matter if only 1 laptops is connected to that AP or 10. Issue stays the same.
 We already restarted all the AP&#x27;s(didn&#x27;t replace an AP though).
 When i take a look on our firewall the decibels are for the working and faulty laptop the same.
 We have a Fortinet FortiGate 100F Firewall
 
 
  
-------------
 What i think the problem is: Our firewalls. The problem is that i don&#x27;t know how to pinpoint the cause of the problem. Is there any tool that can push me in the right direction or does someone have some cool tips &amp; tricks?
 ​
 If you have any questions, i&#x27;ll try to anwser them asap.
 Ps: i&#x27;m not an network engineer. I&#x27;m a service desk person.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been quoting up a server today and the price of enterprise SSDs seems to be stuck in a time warp where we&#x27;re still on 2017 SSD prices.
 I&#x27;ve been thinking instead of getting a bare bones HP/Dell server so it can still slot in with the rest of the management environment but putting in our own storage to bring the price down. 
 With this in mind, does anyone sell a PCIE adapter for m.2 drives with some kind of battery backup to protect from sudden power failure? I thought if we paired this up with a couple of third-party enterprise SSD then it would be suitably robust and still come in about 10 grand cheaper.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I work for a small MSP that&#x27;s looking to improve our response to IT security issues and new vulnerabilities so we can patch or mitigate them as soon as possible.
 We are on top of things most of the time, but we have found this is more due to our sys-admins and engineers being properly paranoid and checking various websites and vendor sites on a daily basis, rather than a proper process.
 So how do you guys do it?

 https://serverfault.com/questions/566304/dns-event-id-4000-on-sbs-2011
 Chattie: The command nltest /sc_change_pwd: is used to reset the secure channel password between a domain controller and the domain. 
 The secure channel password is used to encrypt all communications between the domain controller and the domain. 
 If the secure channel password becomes out of sync between the domain controller and the domain, then you may experience problems 
 with Active Directory replication, authentication, and other services that rely on Active Directory.
 ​
 UnNamed Fella: We solved this issue by running the following command on our domain server:
 nltest /sc_change_pwd:
 Afterwards we had to restart the server.
 ​
 Chattie: You should replace  with the fully qualified domain name of the domain controller. 
 For example, if the domain controller’s fully qualified domain name is dc1.contoso.com, 
 then you would run the command nltest /sc_change_pwd:dc1.contoso.com.
 ​
 Me: we were both wrong. Here is the results of two attempts - the last just using the domain:
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib-sbs.tcib.local
 I_NetLogonControl failed: Status &#x3D; 1355 0x54b ERROR_NO_SUCH_DOMAIN
 Better: 
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib.local
 Flags: 0
 Connection Status &#x3D; 0 0x0 NERR_Success
 The command completed successfully.
 nltest. I must get that tattooed somewhere . . .
 So, Guestdc if that&#x27;s your name, I&#x27;ve no idea where you pulled that from, but I owe you.
 Thanks.

                              <span>We have 2 esxi hosts one is on version 5.7 the other is on 7.0. I tried following a YouTube video which walks through a command line upgrade after downloading the appropriate upgrade file from VMware support site, but it did not work. Would it be easier to get vcenter and do this? I&#x27;m not sure why they never utilize vcenter before.

                              <span>I read that learning how to write scripts (powershell, bash, or python) can help remove repetition tasks, like creating tickets, reset passwords, etc. However, there are platforms that can do just that. Not to mention the time to find, learn, &amp; write these specific scripts (I can&#x27;t find videos or step-by-step tutorials for it). 
 Since help desk job are suppose to be for short-term only, do you think learning to automate is still worth it? Any use of them for sysadmin and network admin?

 For a few days now outlook looses its connection to the exchange server and the only thing that helps is repairing the office installation. 
 Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s in safe mode, cache or online mode. Outlook will refuse to load profiles for anyone on that server and sending mails is not possible.
 Office 2019 is up to date.
 The SaRa tool only works with 365 accounts now so that isn&#x27;t really useful anymore.
 The only configuration change that has been done is enabling mapi and clearing the credentials store/logging in again.
 I&#x27;m out of ideas any help?

                              <span>People think that users are the most annoying to sysadmins but they are wrong. Other sysadmins annoy me the most by far. How do you manage the anger when other &quot;sysadmins&quot; do incompetent stuff like assigning a public ip to a windows 2008 server with firewall disabled because &quot;ping didnt work if firewall is enabled&quot;.....and then they wonder why they got hacked...of course i have to cleanup after them and waste hours of my day instead of doing productive things. By the time they get fired i was annoyed so much im loosing brain cells.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I work for a small 40 person company in the financial services sector. I&#x27;ve been tasked with providing cyber security training for our users including a phishing campaign.
 I&#x27;m happy to do this myself with a service like GoFish but I think it would be beneficial to test us all, myself included.
 Been looking at services like KnowBe4 that provide a phishing campaign and cyber security training based on the results of the campaign but am wondering if you guys have any recommendations?
 I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some excellent options out there and some terrible ones!
 Thanks

                              <span>Greetings fellow sysadmins.
 When my organisation started with 365, they used their UK entity to register as that&#x27;s how they were doing things at the time. Now the organisation&#x27;s regulatory focus has shifted to the EU and so legal and compliance want our data residency changed from the UK to an EU location, which is perfectly reasonable.
 You can&#x27;t move this by default, but MS had legacy methods for certain customers meeting certain requirements and has recently (October-ish 2022 I think) provided an add-on named Advanced Data Residency which will allow you to change your data residency, and Microsoft will shift your tenant within 12 months. As long as you meet the geographic and licensing requirements, you can just buy the add-on and request it; no need to be a huge org with an EA with MS…</span>

                              <span>Not looking for identity management and integration with HR etc. I can&#x27;t influence that so i just want to influence the account management side i do control.
 We use powershell now and i dont have the time to further develop it, i want to buy/use a mainstream tool.
  
Automate the Exit process in AD. eg once we set expiry, the tools will find expired/disabled accounts in specific OUs and do things like, hidefromaddressbook, remove from groups, change a field or two, move to a specific OU, after 30 days then delete.
 Find users that are more than 90 days since sign in (interactive or non interactive) in Azure AD and expire them. AD Connect will disable them and #1 will action them. I have PS to do the AAD part, so if a tool can run the PS then great. If it aged AADJ Device accounts too even better.
 Reporting and analysis on user account changes. We use Ad Audit from manage engine, but i dont really like ad manager plus. 
 We have simple account creation system working fine, but anything that was out of the box integrated with sharepoint or m365 forms would be interesting.
 Other really handy account management things i havent mentioned.
  
I like adaxes for Number 1. But what does this well on a small (around 2k AD accounts) scale? I can host, i can present a local web interface to admins and helpdesk via RDS.

                              <span>Hi All,
 So I am working for this huge company from India but I&#x27;m based in Europe. Generally, this is the most unorganized place ever, with nothing working properly, legacy technology everywhere, no docu, no escalation matrix, no access to the tools, toxic people... Just a nightmare to be honest. I am spending half of my day fixing the problems that are caused by the company systems set up in the first place. 
 I am now looking to move forward and I am struggling to find a job which is closer to the business but further away from sysadmin / day to day support. I honestly do not want to do it anymore, I enjoy talking to stakeholders and even explaining tech issues to non-tech colleagues and I&#x27;m good at it. I have good soft skills too.
 Which jobs would be good to apply to?

                              <span>Greetings. I am making this post to seek assistance from fellow system administrators that have come across difficulty at getting a job at one point or another in their careers. 
 I worked as a system administrator in the DoD for several years. I still have a clearance. Recently got out several months ago. I am working through a Cybersecurity degree and I have the following certifications: Network+, Security+, CySA+, Server+, Linux+ and Blue Team Level 1. My experience is quite broad, during my time in I was the head system administrator for a 50+ server network of virtualized Windows and Linux servers. There really isn&#x27;t a single thing I am expert level at. The nature of my job required me to dip my toes in SQL, Cisco, Alcatel, Linux, Windows, fiber repair, Active Directory, Exchange, and many other things. Despite several revisions to my resume as well as professional resume reviews, getting a job post military has been very difficult. I have upskilled in the security analyst side of things, getting a decent handle on digital forensics tools and incident handling and investigation through tools like Splunk. I did this to sort of round out my skills and open up the possibility of going a more cyber focused route. But again I find myself at a point in which my skills and experience are super broad. 
 I have applied to hundreds and hundreds of positions. Only received one interview of which I did really well during. They asked very simple sysadmin related questions about DHCP, Exchange, Active Directory. Baby stuff. Yet two weeks later I was told I didn&#x27;t get it. At this point I decided to specialize and get better at Linux. I am not sure what to do really. I know many are struggling with the job market. It has been absolutely demoralizing and at some point my savings are going to run up. I have even applied to numerous jobs below my skill and experience level with no success. I don&#x27;t know what to do.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Firstly - yes, I&#x27;d prefer to do a fresh VM host installation and move relevant VMs over but that&#x27;s likely not feasible. Secondly, our current environment for background is 4 Hyper-V hosts running Server 2012 R2 with each machine running 2 VMs
 So, has anyone done an in-place upgrade of Server 2012 R2 to Server 2019 of a Hyper-V host that&#x27;s running VMs? I appreciate that the relevant VMs will be down for a period during this (if it works) which I&#x27;m cool with as we&#x27;re a Mon-Fri 9-5 business but I&#x27;m more concerned about any pitfalls or issues that could occur during this that I haven&#x27;t thought of (mainly because I&#x27;ve not done it this way before)
 The plan was to shut down the VMs, disable auto start, throw up the 2019 ISO on the host and just follow the prompts for in-place as though it was a standard server (I&#x27;ve done plenty of in-place on the average server). Is there anything that will stop me from doing this? Anything I need to look out for? Anything that I won&#x27;t be able to recover from that&#x27;ll force me to go a different route?

                              <span>Hi. I am the founder of Netdata, the open-source, real-time performance monitoring and troubleshooting tool.
 Today we released a new version of the open-source Netdata, having our new ML-first approach to monitoring!
 Netdata now automatically trains multiple ML models using k-means for each metric collected, at the edge, right at the place where metrics are collected. At the same time, Netdata runs anomaly detection in real-time, while metrics are being collected, and the result is stored in its database together with metric data.
 There is a long story there, because we also managed to do this without increasing the footprint of the data on disk or in memory, we figured out how to optimize and control the ML training resources consumption even when millions of metrics are collected per …</span>

 I have checked this thread but couldn&#x27;t find anything else that seemed helpful. Currently no backups running and the user I&#x27;m running these commands from is a Domain Admin, so permissions shouldn&#x27;t be a problem either. Also checked the Event Log and couldn&#x27;t find any errors. dcdiag /q also returns nothing. Also checked the firewall-logs and don&#x27;t see any dropped connections between the DCs. 
 Is there anything else I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hello,
 Does anyone have any insight on dealing with Hikari&#x27;s connection pooling feature when an application is connecting to an oracle database and there&#x27;s a FW in-between? Initially our Palo Alto FW was discarding packets because of multiple subsequent SYN packets on the same port coming in &amp; the FW was logging it as &quot;TCP-REUSE&quot; . We applied a zone protection profile to help mitigate that discard/reject behavior but there are still I/O erros in the Application logs and I&#x27;m still seeing some aged-out sessions. I don&#x27;t believe it has to do with the way the firewall is configured and when we applied a custom application with a higher timeout value it made things worse..no asymm routing either as there are tcp-fins.95 percent success rate but still errors

                              <span>Wondering if it&#x27;s good practice to use certain IP classes for different places. For instance would it be suitable for me to use a 172.16.0.0 in a small restaraunt?

                              <span>I got a weird network issues on my current setup. I suspect this is related to flow control or bufferbloat or something. (I don&#x27;t have too much knowledge on network)
 The network diagram is here: https://pastebin.com/iENaTizD 
 Text diagram:
  
I have one RB5009 router (one SFP+ connected to the switch; one 2.5G connected to 2.5G AP; one 1G connected to 1G AP; one 1G connected to a 1G interface openspeedtest machine)
 One CRS309 switch. (all SFP+)
 2.5G AP (unifi, can go with 2400Mbps Phy speed, 2.5G interface is connected to the router)
 1G AP (unifi, can go with 876Mbps Phy speed, 1G interface is connected to the router)
 Dell server(10G SFP nic, connected to switch, running openspeedtest, pretty sure the openspeedtest server itself can go beyond 5G/5G at least)
 PC (1G nic, connected to router, running openspeedtest.)
  
The problem:
 Devices connecting to those APs (either 2.5G or 1G) will have full upload speed. But their download speed is always half of the upload. I feel that they might have some issues because of mixed interface speeds on the route. If I run speedtest on the 1G PC server, everything is fine.
 In short:
 10G openspeedtest  2.5G/1G AP (half download, correct upload). 1G openspeedtest  2.5G/1G AP (correct download and upload). 10 G openspeedtest  1G PC (correct download and upload) 
 Does anyone know how to solve this issue? Or any ideas on how to debug this? From the results, does that mean the problem exits on those APs? (since the 1G PC can test correctly to 10G openspeedtest)
 Things I have done:
  
I turned on/off all tx/rx flow control. (including flow control settings in unifi controller) They didn&#x27;t help.
 I heard someone mentioned Mikrotik devices have small buffer. And they said there is no solution to 10G&gt;1G cases. (but why my 1G PC doesn&#x27;t have this issue when testing with 10G server?)
 I have a SFP+toRJ45 on the way. I would like to connect the APs directly to the switch to see if it can be fixed.
  
Thanks!

                              <span>In Ben Piper&#x27;s &quot;CCNP Certification Guide&quot; the author says that the only downside to the routed access topology is that it&#x27;s more complex to configure upfront because you have to &quot;allocate two private IP addresses for each point-to-point routed link...[and] you&#x27;ll need to configure a dynamic routing protocol&quot;
 But it seems to me that if you can only have one switch per vlan then you potentially have wasted switchports and need purchase extra switches.
 Also what&#x27;s the point of using vlans at all since the connect routed interfaces separate the broadcast domain anyway?

                              <span>I work for in big tech more or less as a IT support engineer (jack of all trades master of none). I have been looking to make a transition to something more challenging and rewarded and have been messing around with equipment to get at least some hands on knowledge with some networking concepts.
 However I was wondering for folks that do this professionally how often do you get to tinker with hardware in the field? Looking to advance in a field where I can have a nice mix of working on something hands on and software. Would love to hear your personal experiences.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 just out of curiosity; I had a weird requirement to mirror some (L2) traffic to two devices, I didn&#x27;t think that long about it, said sure and then found out that not a single cisco platform in my dc can mirror to two destinations.
 Nexus:
 ERROR: Eth1/10: Only one destination per session 
 ASR920/IOS-XE:
 % Only one Interface can be configured as monitor destination for this session, hence rejecting the entire request configured under this submode 
 ASR9k/IOS-XR:
 just removes the first one added when commiting.
 some whitebox with ipinfusion/ocnos:
 %% ERROR: xe47: Only one destination per session 
 I even tried some huawei switches we had laying around, but also no.
 Funny enough some old Cisco platforms allow that, but I needed three 10G interfaces, so no. Also I can&#x27;t even say if it works but you can at least configure it on a 2960G:
 monitor session 1 destination interface Gi0/7 - 8 
 I then just used a TAP which i luckily had, and that does work fine, but is this request so obscure?
 ​
 I&#x27;m sure I could have worked around that by either spanning to a pseudowire and letting that drop out on two different ports or with ERSPAN or something.
 Am I missing something? Is this just weird and no one would ever need that? Anyone worked around that problem some other way?
 Thanks!

 Now I have to add some Aruba 6100 CX switches to it, and I just realized that the CX series doesn’t support RSTP. What’s the best (easiest) way to get a config that’s compatible for both ArubaOS types?

 Supports integration to a local DNS server. Will build PTR and A/AAAA records as you build IPs. We will then forward requests form our DC&#x27;s to this DNS server.
  
We have tried PHPIPAM. Its ok for what it is but I it has its flaws, and it does not seem like there is much development behind it anymore. Main problem is it does not build A records into the PDNS server while we build entries. 
 Any recommendations?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m facing a weird scenario with a series of Cisco Catalyst 3850, long story short:
 Vlan X, switch A connected to Switch B to Switch C to switch D in a square. STP enabled on the vlan, and each switch is connected to only one other with a trunk with several vlans
 I have one host behind Switch A and one behind Switch C, let&#x27;s call em Ha and Hc respectivelyA-to-D path is blocked on switch D with the port facing switch A in BLK state. Link from B to C is a port channel of 2 members with source mac address hash
 Each switch has a SVI on itself with the same /27 over the vlan X
 If i ping the switches one from each other all is okIf i ping from Ha to Hc i have packet loss (ICMP but also BGP control traffic)
 If i ping from SVI-B to Hc i have 0 packet lossIf i block the A-to-B side with STP port cost, the packet loss vanishes, pinging from Ha to Hc (same for BGP traffic)
 Any idea of what can be the problem? 0 Input errors/CRC on ports.Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 ​
 This might be a bit of a noob question but something I have not done in live environment and we are not big enough to have a lot of test gear and nobody senior has had to do this internally before either. 
 We want to move SVIs from an old Cisco stack of 3750s to new Dell S4048s... I&#x27;ve been trying to test this on an unused vlan but can&#x27;t get the new gateway live on the new stack. 
 Can anyone offer some insight on how to do this safely? There isn&#x27;t much on there except a few legacy VLANs.

 Our initial goal was sticking with a full Ruckus &amp; Sonicwall solution, however the cost is too high. We&#x27;ve been offered either to: 
  
go for one brand (Ruckus) lowering the number of switches, without connecting all wall ports at once, allowing a gradual growth
 opt for lower quality brands (Cambium), or choose a mixed brand solution. I am hereby listing the alternative offers to a full Ruckus solution

                              <span>We have different sites with wireless lan controllers setup in DNA. DNA is in its infancy in our environment but sites and WLCs and some test access points have been setup in it.
 Using Prime we can currently move access points from one site / controller to another. Dead handy for outages / maintenance etc.
 Prime will shortly be decommissioned and I want to do the same thing in DNA.
 When I try i get a combination of the following error messages : 
 &quot; Warning
 Only buildings with wireless profiles can be assigned for AP location. Location , Floor 2, Server Room does not have a profile &quot; 
 AP(s) cannot be assigned to Site(s) Floor 2 . There are no Wireless Controllers in these site(s).
 There are actually WLCs defined in DNA per location.
 From the above it sounds like i need to create a network profile - and if that&#x27;s the solution that&#x27;s fine 
 The thing is access points get all their settings via WLC profile and we&#x27;re ok with that at the moment - we don&#x27;t need DNA to do this. And don&#x27;t want to jump into DNA wireless profiles just yet - unless we absolutely have to !
 We only want DNA to allow us join an access point(s) to a specific controller.
 Any ideas the easiest way to do this

                              <span>We’re currently in a transition period at my workplace where we are wanting to lab test as many of our changes as possible before deploying to prod. A way we are trying to scale this is by running virtual devices in an emulator (EVE-NG) and using them to test the change. To run the whole network in the lab we’d require ~300 devices running concurrently, which presents its own operational problems (and monetary)as we’re essentially running two production networks at the same time. Has anyone gone about doing this before? What are your thoughts on achieving &gt;90% lab testing for every change? Is this a fools game and we should be targeting network simulation instead i.e. Batfish?

                              <span>We have a subdomain which is connected through a ISP-A in CNAME. Through subdomain, a Program runs in a local server with ISP A. If the ISP-A is down, then program doesn&#x27;t run. So we have added ISP-B through router to local server. If ISP-A is down, Local server will pickup ISP-B. Now the real problem is, We have multiple work places. Both ISP runs perfectly at local station. If ISP-A is up and which is connected to C-Name, then issues for other station client or work from home clients. If ISP-A is down and ISP-B is running(which is not connected to C-name), other station clients or work from home clients unable to open to subdomain or run program, Hence we need to change the CNAME to ISP-B to run locally and other stations.
 We have ubuntu server. Can somebody share a solution or an idea to this issue or do need to hire someone to sort?

 Sometimes you may just need some Linux. 
 Just because no one knows it doesn’t mean you can’t learn it. I’ll even write notes how to restart and so on. Just give it a damn shot! 
 If you want to be cheap be open.

                              <span>Had a weird issue with 3 users on a single PC (same PC, multiple users use it) when opening a couple very old Access .mdb files. Basically they would open them, print a report from them, close the file, then try and open another .mdb file (there are 4 of these) and they would just get a spinning circle of doom and you would have to open task manager and end the task. 
 These files live on a network drive and I tried several things but nothing seemed to permanetly fix the issue. The odd thing was that on any other PC the files works fine for these same users and they never got the spinning circle of death.
 Well I had talked to them and gave them a work around of going into task manager and finding a second Access task and ending that and then the files opened fine, and I got a verbal confirmation from the users that this was good enough so I stopped working on the issue.
 ​
 Fast forward to today where I get a call from their supervisor pissed that this issue is occuring for them and when is it going to be fixed. Yeah, it&#x27;s my fault for not CYOA, but I recalled at that moment that whenever they had this issue the .accdb access files would open fine no matter what.
 So I opened each .mdb in edit mode where I could see all the forms, macros, tables, etc and I just copied all of them and pasted into a new .accdb file and named it the same thing. From what i could tell everything seemed to be working fine. They were not some crazy complex things, just a few tables, forms, queries, and macros.
 I really won&#x27;t know 100% though until end of week, but that should be fine right? There&#x27;s no weird issue in just copying all the tables, forms, etc from a .mdb into a .accdb right?

                              <span>I went on an interview for a system admin position for a fairly large company. They have around 400 windows servers. During the interview he said that it would be my job to manually login to each server and run updates from the wsus and reboot them over a weekend. He said oh, it only takes around 4 hours. Lol. I asked him why sccm isn’t being used or at least gpos to automate it some and stagger reboots? He said why do you think that is an issue? I said, taking time away from your employees weekends when it can be automated. He said, he wants to make sure all systems are running. I said, that’s what monitoring software is for and alerts. And someone can check in the morning. He didn’t like me asking, and I didn’t care. 
 I didn’t want the job anyways after they said the sole system admin would be helping help desk and desktop support when it’s slow instead of researching and improving the environment. IMHO seems this guy didn’t belong being a director of IT. He’s also the security admin and sys admin. 
 Got the email this morning of them turning me down when they acted all gun hoe about wanting me before I said that. Lol. I got offered a job the day before with the city anyways, which I didn’t accept yet till I went to this job to see what they offered.

 I&#x27;m running up against an insane old school senior sysadmin who insists naming servers nonsense names is good for security because it confuses hackers because they don&#x27;t know what the machine does.
 It&#x27;s an absurd emotional argument. 
 Everyone here knows that financeapp-prod-01 is better to use than morphius, but I need some backing beyond my opinion.

Ever since I also read about people’s phones being hijacked by emails containing Calendar Invites embedded in the email. It just really rubs me the wrong way.

                              <span>Hey folks, I’m wondering what y’all use for appliance PCs if you’re building them. I’ve got a couple of applications that won’t run virtualized, so I’m forced to build PCs for them. 
 These are going to be rack mount machines. It seems like finding a 800+ Watt power supply to fit into a 2RU chassis is becoming a struggle. 
 In the past I’ve used Supermicro server mobo and intel CPU. Don’t need anything fancy for GPU and on board GPU works fine. 
 What parts do y’all like when building machines? Thanks.

This morning I get berated about a ticketless task that I missed a deadline for, even though it wasn’t on top of the priority. I made it clear this particular task wasn’t at the top of my list since there was no clear deadline. I also am trying to interview and land a new job but I won’t be able to start until my consulting contract wraps up in 3 more months(or pay back this years bonus). If I get fired, it looks bad, if I leave I need to pay them back, I just can’t seem to fucking win. What would you do?
 Update: I walked out today thanks everyone!
 Update 2: kidding aside, thank you all for encouraging words. I am going to set my limits and set up meeting with my manager to get a hold of this situation. As for the unpaid overtime, I will likely speak to an employment lawyer. Thanks again.

 We have an AD domain, DC&#x27;s host DNS (AD-integrated, Secure dynamic updates only), a separate Windows DHCP server (configured to run with a DHCP service account per MS recommendations, set to &#x27;Always Register Dynamic DNS&#x27; for clients), and Windows 10 clients.
 Issue is that our laptops have problems with inconsistent DNS A records - their A record won&#x27;t always update to their latest-assigned IP. They move between on-site LAN, WiFi, and a VPN. It seems that back and forth with the VPN is where they get tripped up the most.
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of reading and testing various setups. I believe it really comes down to who owns, and therefore has the permissions needed to update, the DNS record for th…</span>

Its a pretty standard affair but my boss wants to have people who connect to Public Wifi (most commonly would be our salesmen) to have VPN. He wanted me to source another VPN solution like nord/express/ect stating that he doesn&#x27;t think we want them connecting to our vpn just for accessing email. So I have a few questions.
  
How well does a 3rd party vpn play with a work vpn like a sonicwall vpn
 If its just security for when accessing email is 3rd party more secure or would sonicwall be more secure.
 Any vpn recommendations that work well on Apple phones, especially for very non-tech savvy users.

                              <span>Well happy monday everyone, hopefully this issue is localized and not affecting 2012R2 as a whole for those of us unfortunate enough to still be running it.
 Got a call first thing Saturday morning about no internet connectivity at work, so naturally I go in and start taking a look around and come to find out the server hosting our primary DHCP has locked up. It&#x27;s a VM so I just reboot it and now it&#x27;s stuck in a blue screen/reboot loop. Okay whatever, needed an excuse to retire/upgrade that server anyways, and I&#x27;ve got a physical DHCP 2016 server on hot-standby so not too big of an issue.
 Come in this morning and now the issue has spread to our Printing Server and Domain Controller VMs. Print server actually seemed fine with a reboot but the DC got stuck in a boot loop just like DHCP. Also not a big deal since I&#x27;ve got a physical 2022 server that actually serves as the primary DC but still this just seems wild to me that it all happened at once.
 Granted none of this has been a real show-stopper since we&#x27;ve got redundancy but I was just wondering if anyone else had run into 2012R2 suddenly offing itself recently. Or just any other fun monday morning blues.
 I&#x27;ll also update this thread if I figure out anything. Servers seem to be booting when I remove their networking adapters in Hyper-V so that&#x27;s a thing

                              <span>Morning all!
 -As of the beginning of last week, we have had an absurd amount of tickets come in for &quot;TPM Module Has Malfunctioned&quot;. I am talking hundreds of tickets across our clients.
 -We have not pushed anything out pertaining to TPM, or 365.
 -On all clients, it seems like having them manually sign-out of Office and sign back in fixes the issue, but it is so frequent that this morning, we would usually be at 10 or 15 tickets by this point, we are at 56 with a majority being this TPM error. has anyone else seen this with their clients? I am having trouble finding anything as far as new known issues go for this outside of the tons of articles pertaining to TPM over the last few years.
 ​
 -Has anyone else seen a huge influx of these TPM issues as of the last few weeks?

                              <span>Hello, I am interested in what other orgs are allowing on their Guest Network to WAN firewall rules. We have our guest network segregated by VLAN and it cannot communicated with any other internal networks. However, our Guest to WAN (internet) firewall rule only allows HTTP/HTTPS and a few other web and email related ports. Lately we have had some people complain about certain smart phone apps not working on the guest wifi. After doing some digging I found that some apps require other ports to be allowed in order to fully work. One example is the Sonic Drive-In app, it would not allow you to get to the check out screen. When I did a packet trace it showed port 5671 was blocked. I opened it as a test and now the app works. I have a few other apps with similar connection issues.
 Does anyone just allow Guest to WAN with ANY service allowed? If so, do you consider this safe from a cybersecurity standpoint?

                              <span>This is a bit on the rant side, so please forgive the length.
 Got a client using Barracuda for mail security. All emails from the voicemail service are getting quarantined. Barracuda clearly notes it is an SPF issue, and sure enough when checking it on MXTOOLBOX the SPF record is misconfigured and there are no DKIM or DMARC records associated with that email domain. Client wants to whitelist that address/domain. I hate doing this since hackers always try to spoof email with voicemail subjects, better to do this correctly and safely.
 So I open a ticket and get the VOIP 1st tier, send them the exact error on MXTOOLBOX and tell them to send that to the department that handles your email/dns and correct it. They insist no one else has this issue, and anyway you can just put that address on t…</span>

                              <span>I have 5 new Dell computers I need to get setup for end users. However, the situation is a little unusual so I am looking for advice on what you all would do in this situation. 
 Some important info:
  
The devices are being deployed to a brand-new network (no other end devices)
 We are not using any directory system (AD, Azure, LDAP, etc), and implementing them is out of the question unfortunately. 
 I am aware how annoying this is lol. I have tried to suggest using azure + intune, but was shut down.
 
 I do not have a central server to use, just the 5 devices (one of which is for me to do testing, so really only 4 to deploy to users)
 The devices will eventually need to be CMMC compliant
  
Here is what I need advice on:
  
What is the best way to configure an base image that contains all configuration changes, driver updates, etc? 
 I have looked into NinjaOne RMM, Canonical MaaS, MeshCentral, and MDT. I have used MaaS and MeshCentral before, but most likely these won&#x27;t be approved for me to use. I have never used MDT before and it seems like a lot to get into and I am in somewhat of a time crunch to deploy the machines.
 
 I also will need to get the basic day-to-day applications installed for the users, I&#x27;m not sure if it would be best to bake them into the build, or install them manually on each device after the fact 
 Im new to Windows management, is there a way to install programs with a script? I have heard of chocolatey being similar to Linux package management.
 
  
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting to include something, so I may edit or make a comment. Any help is greatly appreciated.
 Also, in advance to the suggestions to convince my manager to give me some leeway on choosing what tools I use, I have tried and he won&#x27;t budge.

                              <span>Given a list of 2000 public end point hostnames which are responding on port 80, I am looking for a tool that could crunch though them, capture HTTP response code (I made it this far), get the page title, and if the response is a 301 redirect, capture the final URL (to determine whether the redirect was just to an HTTPS endpoint, or whether its redirecting to another site altogether.
 Capturing information about the SSL certificates (if any) would also be helpful (whether their self-signed, issued from our CA, or issued from commercial CA), but not required.
 Ideally this would all be stored in a database so that the same hosts don&#x27;t need to be scanned over and over.
 I started down this rabbit hole with a Laravel app, but once I got to the point of capturing redirects I figured, &quot;you know, maybe this tool already exists&quot;.
 I want a final output that&#x27;s easy to search and summarize.

 Any ideas?

                              <span>I have a room where the cable internet comes in and houses electrical panels and a large transformer. I noticed a puddle of water on the floor the other day. Looks like it came out of a utility conduit (6-8 inch) that comes out of the cement flooring. Looks like they sealed it with foam insulation previously. We had the cable company look but they said there was no signs of water on the outside. The conclusion is there must be some area in the conduit under the foundation that allowed water to seep in. The suggestion was to rip out the foam insulation and re-seal it rather than trenching into the foundation. Though I don&#x27;t feel foam insulation is going to be watertight. I am also concerned about our cable/internet cables just soaking in water long term. 
 Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Do you have any suggestion or should I not be concerned?

                              <span>I have a customer who in their turn have a customer using MAPI for a custom build app that only supports Outlook 2003. They finally allow me to move them to Exchange 2019, but now they find out this app for this Very Important Customer (like, 80% of their revenue) will no longer work because Exchange 2019 is not friends with Outlook 2003. The original dev (from 2000 or so) left that company, so no one wants to touch it.
  
 The compromise management found is that I will set-up a new 2008R2 DC, a domain on its own, with an Exchange 2010, and a new mail domain, to host the single mailbox necessary for Outlook 2003. Like this the customer&#x27;s Exchange can migrate to 2019 and the customer&#x27;s customer can keep using the app until they found someone to re-write the source in ten years or so.
  
 Sigh.

As a part of this project, I am seeking stakeholders who can provide valuable insights and suggestions on the development of the PassVault application.
 If you are interested in providing any feedbacks and suggestions to this project, please feel free to share your suggestions and ideas on what features you would like to see in a password manager application. Your input can help shape the direction of this project and contribute to the development of a secure and user-friendly password manager application.

 As part of my project requirement, I cannot proceed to develop PassVault without a stakeholder&#x27;s or a general users opinion and feedback on the features they would like to see in the password manager.

                              <span>I have a Synology RS3621 and it’s 12-bay expansion unit. I got my hands on 12x 22TB WD RED drives to fill the main unit, but the only 22TB drives I can find right now are Seagate. Would it be a problem if I fill the expansion chassis with Seagate drives? I’m going to be making two volumes - one for the main, a one for the expansion - so no volume will contain mixed drives. All will be either WD or Seagate.
 Would love to know anyone’s thoughts, as I don’t think we’ll be getting WDs anytime soon.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi guys, I hope you can help me out with this one. I need a script or tool that detects file changes or deletion in a specific folder and restores the files by deleting the newly created files and copying the original files over from a backup folder. 
 The reason why I need this is because I&#x27;m running a program that keeps deleting two files and creating two new ones with the same name that keep breaking the whole thing and I am tired to keep copying the two old files back and forth. Before I could just mark the two files as read only with the windows tools which kept them untouched, but as of now since a new update of the program it now deletes the files and makes new ones. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Hi All
 We are a Hybrid/Windows/10 M365 E5 org and have a decent SSO experience for users logging into a device for the first time. We direct users to sign into the OneDrive app first, supply MFA and then all office apps are signed in. 
 What isn’t quite working however is Microsoft Edge. When a user opens Edge (after signing into their office apps as above), there is a message to complete the sign-in. 
 “Work – 
 Not Syncing
 We’ve detected this account on your device and we need to verify it before you can complete sign in, and set up sync.” 
 If you click on the “complete Sign in” button, the user is then signed in with no additional prompt or MFA. We are trying to figure out how we can remove the need for the user to click the Complete Sign in button.
 1 GP we are pushing is:
 Browser sign-in settings - Force users to sign-in to use the browser
 Is anyone else experiencing this or have a workaround?
 Thanks!

 What I want of a system is a ChatGPT like system here you ask it a question like, what services is running on SERVER and what special configuration has been done to it?
 Do you guys know a system like this or are you using something similar to this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try not to make this too long, here is the basic recap of the situation:
 I was hired as the first security engineer for a company with around 300 total users. They have absolutely 0 infrastructure or security tools in the environment currently.
  
All windows machines running windows 10 home
 no active directory
 no endpoint protection
 all machines currently have the same login credentials and each user then logs into office 365 and other apps using their own credentials
  
The infra/security team was recently created when the CTO hired a sysadmin (2 months ago), 1 tech support guy, and myself. I didn&#x27;t really receive any sort of training since well there&#x27;s nothing really to train. I asked the CTO for any diagrams or info about the current setup and she gave a single network diagram with switches and 1 gateway (which we can&#x27;t access - it was setup by a third-party and they didn&#x27;t leave a config file or credentials). I decided to try to use the CIS controls as a base point to suggest security improvements. Basically I wrote a proposal with the help of the new sysadmin saying we should get Windows 10/11 Pro, install AD, and use Defender for endpoint protection (this would required upgrading from O365 business standard to O365 business premium). 
 Long story short, the CTO rejected the proposals saying she&#x27;s not convinced that what we proposed will solve the security issues. She said to focus on security policies and to prepare for ISO certification.
 My question is what the fuck do I do here? Has anyone ever had a CTO who either didn&#x27;t know what AD was or was really against its use? Is there any other way to manage machines remotely that is more cost-efficient? Should I just look for a new job that has more reasonable leadership?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Spent some of my weekend helping colleagues coordinate work to fix an issue which essentially bricks machines and forces hands on to fix and the support from Microsoft boiled down to checks we&#x27;d already been through and provided info on numerous times.
 Eventually by the time it was handed over to India they just pointed us to articles we&#x27;d been through already and asked for logs. Then gave us tools which created 20GB+ log files in the span of 15 mins and said they couldn&#x27;t assist us any further so that ended up getting parked. The actual MS &quot;SME&quot; on the call was mediocre next to a helpdesk tech.
 As part of the analysis/fix we accidentally disabled a setting in Group Policy which effectively broke a lot of app services and caused other issues as it stopped the SOE / IE from being able to call out to the internet properly.
 At no point did the MS techs warn us of this and when we spent a day running through everything to figure out the problem and identified it was issues with the SOE using the PAC we sent more logs to Microsoft who literally just said &quot;yes it looks like you have a problem communicating with the internet we should do a log network trace&quot; and it&#x27;s only after handing over to the EMEA support (which nobody communicated to us, we were just sat waiting a few hours) that we got a good way forward. 
 The only time I&#x27;ve seen (Non MSP) vendor support any worse was dealing with Oracle&#x27;s APAC managers and DBA support.

                              <span>Good morning, I have a small problem. I have a cloud server connected to my local network via VPN where an Oracle database is hosted. The problem arises when I try to perform a &quot;select&quot; query, as it gives me a connection error. As a test, I created the exact same machines, one locally and one in the cloud with VPN, and using the same process, the local machine connects successfully, but the machine with VPN does not.
 Do you have any idea what might be causing this issue? 
 If this post violates any of the server rules because it is a very open-ended question or if it&#x27;s a low-quality post, please let me know so I can delete it.

                              <span>you remember? It&#x27;s still a nightmare in our production system where half dozen of computers are still running Win7 and can&#x27;t print because we patched our printserver. Is there some workaround available for the clients which doesn&#x27;t have Win7 ESU with the vulnerability-patch included?

 ​
 I was recently asked to change the default value for msDS-DeletedObjectLifetime from the default 180 days to 90 days in order to meet compliance regulations. I know that this change will make the value for both msDS-DeletedObjectLifetime &amp; TombStoneLifetime different. I would like to check with you experienced folks if there are any implications if I were to do this. Thanks! :)

                              <span>Hi.
 I have a local Postfix server for a app that can not authenticate to MS Exchange online. When sending a lot of messages the app gets an error:
 Error: An error occurred with the following error message: &quot;Server not available, closing transmission channel. The server response was: 4.7.0 Too many messages.&quot;.
 Is there a way to set a higher limit for Postfix to accept more messages?

                              <span>I have weird problem with Itune. We have a phone which shows as Compliant at device list but actually isn’t compliant. There should be policy A, B and Default Device Compliance Policy. Both A and B is missing and Default Device Compliance Policy shows error at step of DefaultDeviceCompliancePolicy.RequireDeviceCompliancePolicyAssigned. State details says 65001 (Not Applicable).
 Why does device list show this phone as compliant while it isn’t and how to fix Intunes so this kind of situation doesn’t occur again?

 I’m not the youngest on our team by far, and we are getting more and more work working with GitHub, Terraform and Ansible. I need to catch up and feel in the gaps I have to gain confidence.
 I’ve been looking on Udemy and wondered if anyone can recommend a course that ticked the above for you?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello network wizards,
 I&#x27;m in the process of setting up a Fortinet SD-WAN solution in an environment with three interconnected hubs, linked via dark fiber. At the moment, we have a couple of Cisco Nexus 9000s (N9Ks) managing Data Center Interconnection (DCI) at each hub site, all of them running EIGRP. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I can efficiently advertise the DC networks within the SD-WAN fabric. We have 10 remote sites.
  
Is it advisable to stick with EIGRP, or should I explore transitioning to OSPF or BGP in the context of the new SD-WAN setup?
 
Would it be better to overlay the SD-WAN on top of the current network infrastructure or should I consider a more thorough network redesign to better accommodate the SD-WAN?

                              <span>Thought I&#x27;d come to the collective, am I stupid or is DCNM and VXLAN EVPN BGP just a waste of time and trying to resolve a problem that no one said existed. 
 I have started working at a company where they have DCNM deployed by contractors that are no longer there, they replaced the old nexus 5000 with nexus 9000 and DCNM. 
 We have L2 links to all 4 of our DCs in a ring and always will. Also due to the nature of the company, growth will not equal more DCs.
 We have dedicated Internet pipes at each DC, and an active active firewall pair at the two primary of the 4 DCs. 
 I guess I&#x27;m just struggling to find out what the technical reason for deploying DCNM was, did my previous encombant just get caught in the technical weeds and sold on a null issue by the contractors sales team or am I missing something because I truely don&#x27;t see anything special about this DC that couldn&#x27;t be achieved with a strong switching core, HSRP and some basic routing.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t seem to be able to set ospf costs at all with frr - configs seem to be ok, but neighbor says no cost associated.
 Background: Running Anycast DNS and HTTPS, using quagga on RHEL for OSPF high availability across our data centers, successfully. Looking to upgrade RHEL and therefore moving to FRR. Having some issues with that (a later post), but looking to answer a background question first. Network guys want me to continue using OSPF (vs BGP). I&#x27;m a sysadmin, and only a routing noob. 
 I&#x27;ve largely moved our quagga configurations over to frr test systems. However, I noticed that setting OSPF costs for interfaces (lo loopback) seemed to have no effect. In the quagga config (same lo loopback architecture), changing OSPF cost affects routes (as it should). In the frr config, it does not. The router guys can see the cost changes on their route updates when I change quagga configs. They see no route cost changes when I change the frr config. In fact, they have a cost of 0 for ours no matter what I set ours to (10 total, technically, but that includes their default cost for the hop).
 I would expect my configured cost to be picked up by my neighbor, but it is not (for frr). I assume this is a bug, but maybe it&#x27;s different functionality of frr from quagga regarding loopback? If it&#x27;s a feature, does that imply I must move my OSPF service interfaces from lo?
 More details for clarity:
 Frr system: RHEL9 running frr 8.2.2 provided by Red Hat. However, I also tried frr 8.5.1 directly from FRR. &quot;pallando1&quot; is the system name. I&#x27;ll put the config in a comment.
 Happy to provide additional details as requested. Any ideas?

                              <span>Trying to decide which product to purchase. Looking for some clarification between plans.
 Premium+ says it includes 3,100 labs, premium 1,000 labs, and fundamentals is not specified. What are the differences in the labs? Do all three plans include labs in all four areas of Networking, Cyber Security, Data Science, and Cloud, but just less of each area? Or are each of the plans tailored more towards certain areas over others? For example, I am most interested in networking and cloud. Would Premium be the best value? Premium+ seems to include more focus on cyber security, which I would not be utilizing - not right away at least.
 I appreciate any insight. Thanks.

                              <span>I have three sites connected in a ring topology and I am having trouble figuring out how to get EIGRP to put a feasible successor in the topology. If site A wants to reach site B directly then the successor route is in the topology table and routing table. If site A wants to reach site B through site C then the issue is that the RD is equal the AD and it does not get put into the topology table and I am at the mercy of the algorithm rerunning during a link failure. If I try to manipulate values like delay on certain links then it creates a situation where traffic will go a non-optimized path (i.e. site a to site b would travel through site c). 
 Any advice on how this should be done properly? We are looking to move to OSPF but have not dug through the details there to see if it would be any different.

 Background: Running Anycast DNS and HTTPS, using quagga on RHEL for OSPF high availability across our data centers, successfully. Looking to upgrade RHEL and therefore moving to FRR. Having some issues with that (a later post), but looking to answer a background question first. Network guys want me to continue using OSPF (vs BGP). I&#x27;m a sysadmin, and only a routing noob.
 Previous config (simplified) used real ethernet (eth0) for the &quot;server&quot; addresses (.150) and loopback (lo) for the &quot;service&quot; (OSPF) addresses (.130):

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve taken on a mammoth task of building new VMware DVS switches on a clients environment and migrated all vm networking over from the previous cisco aci virtual networking backed dvs. 
 I’ve managed to get it all complete but now it’s time to delete the old dvs and I’m struggling to find info on the correct process to do this. Has anyone been through this before? I can see the vswitch in the APIC gui under the virtual networking tab &gt; vmm integration &gt; VMware. Do I delete this or remove the vcenter within to start with? Or do I start by deleting it from vcenter first? 
 My train of thought is this.
  
Maintenance mode a host at a time and delete the vswitch from the host 
 
once all hosts are removed delete the folder in which the dvs is in
 
open apic and remove the vcenter from the vmm integration 
 
delete the vmm object 
 
 I found this kb to build but nothing to remove https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/4-x/virtualization/Cisco-ACI-Virtualization-Guide-42x/Cisco-ACI-Virtualization-Guide-421_chapter_011.html

                              <span>I&#x27;m a novice (&gt;6 months experience) working in a rural area just looking for direction. 
 Here&#x27;s the scenario: An outside company wants to set up a VPN router in my network for access to cameras and wants me to give them a WAN Interface Static IP Address, Subnet, and Gateway info. I mostly understand what each part is individually, but I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing for them. 
 Is this something to be configured in my firewall? Like am I trying to give them an IP address in there and do something with ACLs to allow them access?
 Or do I need another public IP address from my company&#x27;s ISP?
 Do I need more information from them in order to solve the problem?
 I don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m looking for in order to just google it. Thanks for any help given.

                              <span>I set up Radius on a Netgear Prosafe (M7100-24X) and Telnet+Radius works every time. 
 SSH with Radius is not working, and Access-Requests are NOT seen on the Radius server.
 Here is what I think is the relevant CLI:
 ip ssh server enable aaa authentication login &quot;MyDefaultList&quot; radius local aaa authentication enable &quot;MyDefaultEnableList&quot; none radius accounting mode radius server host auth &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; name &quot;RADSERVER&quot; radius server key auth &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; encrypted MyPSK radius server primary &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; radius server host acct &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; name RADSERVER radius server key acct &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; encrypted MyPSK line telnet login authentication MyDefaultList enable authentication MyDefaultEnableList exit line ssh login authentication MyDefaultList enable authentication MyDefaultEnableList password MyLineSSHPassword encrypted exit 
 Through guessing/testing I found that if I enable OR disable Radius Attribute 4, then I will be able to login successfully with SSH+Radius ONE TIME.
 To reiterate: I enable Attribute 4 and input ANY value:
 SSH 1 : radius packets are seen from Wireshark the Radius server, and login is successful
 SSH 2+ : All attempts fail, and no radius packets are seen from Rad server.
 I Disable Attribute 4
 SSH 1 : radius packets are seen from Wireshark the Radius server, and login is successful
 SSH 2+ : All attempts fail, and no radius packets are seen from Rad server.
 Repeatable indefinitely. Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m sending this because I’m pretty sure most of you have faced a similar issue early on in your careers so I’m hoping to get some guidance. 
 How important is it to have interest or passion within Networking Domain. Especially from an ISP pov, where Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, voice services are huge domains in themselves. 
 Is it important to only look at which domain it’s possible to earn the most money, or if a company fixes a domain to focus on, or to choose whichever domain you’re truly passionate about. Need some guidance on this because I’m at a phase in my career where my organization is planning to fix a specific technology on me to focus on.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>We have dell n2048p switches stacked in our office and every time our yealink phones firmware tries to update the switch kills the port about 30-40% through the process. This occurs if we upgrade via Yealinks servers, our VOIP providers servers or locally through the phones https gui, even on the same subnet as the phone to eliminate the firewall. Our normal configuration is to have an access vlan for pcs and a voip vlan on our user ports, which works as intended. In the logs it shows spanning tree killing the port during the upgrade, however, if I turn spanning tree off on the port in behaves the same way. The only way I can get the upgrade to push through is to change the port to just an access vlan and remove the voice vlan. Has anyone else seen this behavior or have an idea of how to fix it? Changing all of our ports to get a firmware upgrade is not ideal.

                              <span>Hello, 
 So I&#x27;m supporting a plant floor with a harsh environment for most &quot;IT&quot; related equipment. Cold in the winter 30-40 F. Hot in the summer 110-120F air quality is also not great weld dust and other things that are not nice to OT equipment. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has found a &quot;good&quot; solution for an environment such as this? I&#x27;ve ran Cisco, Fortinets, Adtran, few things they all will eventually suffer early failure. 1-3 year life expectancy. 
 Is there a better option? 
 Thanks

 I am trying to add a VLAN onto a trunk and it keeps appending the native VLAN onto the list change the number. 
 In Trunk mode, currently my native vlan is set to 13 and I have Vlan 50 tagged. I am trying to add VLAN 17 so I type in 17,50. When I hit save it changes the list of tagged VLANs to 50,1317. I can&#x27;t seem to change to this 17, 50. What am I doing it wrong here?

                              <span>I overheard a network engineer vendor we work with describe a proposed topology I didn&#x27;t quite understand. Two distinct networks each with their own respective VLANs would be connected by L3 switches across an MPLS link using only SVIs, so something like a /30 only between the edge switches like so is what I&#x27;m presuming. I tried to do this in PacketTracer but couldn&#x27;t get it to work, so I assume I&#x27;m missing something:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 description SITE2_EDGE_SW-SITE1_EDGE_SW switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 100 ! interface Vlan100 description SITE2_EDGE_SW ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.252 ! interface Vlan10 description PC_VLAN ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0 
 Is it possible to simply route traffic from SITE2 that is destined for VLANS at SITE1 across an SVI like this? Normally I would have done this using a non switchport physical interface that I assigned a /30 ip address to Gi0/1 instead of doing it across L2 trunk, but I could easily be missing something obvious. 
 Is it possible to route traffic from, say, the PC_VLAN in SITE2 on 10.0.10.0 out through Gi0/1 to a SITE1 VLAN on a different subnet like 10.0.100.0 using a L2 trunk?

                              <span>Currently facing a task which looks (and is) extremely simple but I&#x27;m clearly missing out on something.
 Basically I need to filter out of the BGP process *all* the networks with a prefix larger than /24. In the Cisco lab it&#x27;s done by prefix-set and route-policy statements, and the logic is the same.
 I wrote these two lines:
 ip ip-prefix invalid-prefixes index 10 permit 0.0.0.0 0 match-network greater-equal 25 less-equal 32 route-policy test-block-invalid deny node 10 if-match ip-prefix invalid-prefixes 
 then I applied the route-policy to a single peer in the BGP configuration, so again pretty simple:
 bgp XXXXX ipv4-family unicast peer peer-name route-policy test-block-invalid import 
 but when I checked via display bgp routing-table I found that everything from that peer had been filtered out, including the default route.
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thank you

                              <span>I have over 11 years of traditional networking experience (LAN, routing protocols, routers, switches etc.) and have recently switched to telecom networking. Now I am handling cloud-native, 5G, NFV, virtualization, RAN, accelerated cards, K8s etc. I have always liked learning, troubleshooting/creating labs on GNS so learning new stuff isn&#x27;t a problem for me however I am overwhelmed as in where to start from. 10 years of experience seems more like a problem than a help since that level of understanding is expected out of me. Also, seems like we don&#x27;t have as much material (at least structured, IMO) as on traditional networking specially from/on Cisco (which is where I have had major experience in).
 Any recommendations on how make the transition or any resources? I am looking to make a structured plan and go for it. Any sort of career guidance? I would love to connect with someone who has worked in both or is currently working in telco networking.
 I have had people telling me I am insane to come to telecom from traditional networking since there is more scope in the latter which sets me back and messes with my already struggling mind.
 Lastly, this is my 1st post on reddit (which was removed twice, I have no idea why), if I have made some mistakes or not obliged to any rules , please be easy on me.
 Also, would love to connect with people working in Telecom networking. DM me.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am in a process of changing jobs and I am at a crossroad. I wanted to asked you for an opinion, which would you pick and why.
 I have an offer for a mid-level Network Engineer position in the Engineering department at a Investment Bank working with Prisma Palo Alto, Infoblox, migrating infrastructure to Azure and working with Ansible, etc.
 Another option would be SRE in Operations team at a Cloud Company who focuses on multiple cloud solutions but the job would primarily focus on Azure stuff working with Terraform, ARM, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Cloudformation.
 I don&#x27;t want to make my decision with salary or other benefits in mind but want to figure out what would be best for my growth and my career.
 I figure that SRE is more desirable but I am not sure how valuable is working in operations team as supposed to an engineering team.

                              <span>SUMMARY
The Snake implant is considered the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool designed and used by Center 16 of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive targets. To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB’s ultimate targets. Snake’s custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.
We have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australi…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I am 44F. Prior to accident and then pregnancy, I worked for a company that provided ISP (business line) and everything - from my ergonomic desk, chair, three 32&quot; monitors, printers, shredder, VOIP phone. etc. It was an American company and my partner stayed behind and I ended up leaving due to maternity.
 After COVID, leaving the company, pregnancy, moving house and having a new job as well as being classed as disabled by my GP, I was wondering, what people&#x27;s set up are like now. I used to work in the NOC and use Linux as my main laptop, I used to have a sit/stand desk and this is replicated at home, except for the monitor setup. I only have that 3x 32&quot; laptop. Apologies if I am using the wrong terms here as I have had spent 2020-2022 mostly in hospital due to sepsis. I have this special chair/monitor. I am currently just returning to work so quite unsure how my setup at home will be.
 Disabled or not, will you mind sharing your current desk setup to me? I live in the UK and have applied to Access to Work. They have a 5 month waiting time. Regardless of how long it is, I would like to make sure I have ask for the appropriate things and not go over the top. I am wheelchair bound and you can find some of my medical issues here https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/134aah7/is_oral_surgery_the_only_recourse_is_there_any/
 Thank you in advance for all your help.

 Has anyone figurd this out. IT worked great with Windows 10. 
 Is the key to join Azure and connect AD to Azure and have the bitlocker keys stored there vs. in AD?

 I know you can pull audit logs for certain things, is this one of them? If so how would you ?

 Thanks!

                              <span>Wondering if anybody has cracked the task that is far more difficult than it should be and found a decent script to correctly display dormant accounts in a 365 tenancy in order to save on licences. We have found a way pulling multiple different reports using a 3rd party tool and trying to automate that with little success so far.
 Trying to be pre-emptive here only, but simply pulling &quot;inactive accounts&quot; like most posts suggest in Azure AD pulls erroneous data, only way we have found is to compare activity reports from multiple sources which is time consuming and harder then it should be.

                              <span>For those of you that have a pretty thorough understanding and access to your environments, how does your OS breakdown for your servers?
 Give rough total amount of servers (primarily virtual, but could be physical too; not including networking equipment like switches/routers/etc), and the breakdown of Windows or Linux or Unix or other.
 If you’re willing to provide the Industry you’re in that would be cool too. 
 I’m just curious as I browse LinkedIn jobs periodically to see what technologies companies use and thought what better forum to post on

                              <span>Hi so dumb question since I guess my knowledgeable wasn’t on par on this
 Situation customer have on premise AD with azure ad connect and a tenant
 We enabled password write back and tested with SSPR and all works
 Most users are uses their synced UPN but doesn’t go on the local AD as their devices are hybrid ad joined, so they are mostly on azure.
 Since their account are sync from in premise when I check either password must be changed at next logon or change the default domain policy to expire after 10 days, no one on azure had been forced to changed their password and their outlook connection never expired
 Is it because the password expire only works on the local ad and not on azure ad?
 Thanks

                              <span>We have this annoying problem. A user signs into their Adobe account using Adobe Reader, which makes Adobe Reader unusable. What happens is that upon launching Adobe Reader, it will continually pop up with Certificate errors and they&#x27;re impossible to click out of. I&#x27;ve tried to sign out, but I get an error in doing so.
 Several months ago, I was able to rid of the error by uninstalling Adobe Reader (64-bit), installing the 32-bit version, then uninstalling that and re-installing the 64-bit version. In doing so, I also cleaned all of the suggested folders.
 Just looking for a quicker way. Does such exist? Are there Group Policies for this which don&#x27;t allow saving user sign-in information?

I can certainly write it out, but I also like to make some sort of visual for things like this. 
 Resources we are backing up:
 Wordpress Sites (x16)
 Salesforce (x155 users)
 M365 (50 SharePoint Sites, 100 users, and a handful of shared mailboxes)
 File Server (Synology NAS w/ a few legacy stores)
 ​
 Templates or suggestions much appreciated.

                              <span>Starting to work through benefits and events for my department for the next fiscal period, I&#x27;m curious what are some of the unique benefits other companies offer.
 Last year, I gave all engineering and up a pilot run of the unlimited PTO benefit. This year we made it permanent after both my team satisfaction and organizational IT satisfaction skyrocketed. Most averaged 4 1/2 weeks of PTO, 1 took only a day off and another took 7 weeks off for his son&#x27;s birth.
 Organizationally, we don&#x27;t do WFH but the policy I&#x27;ve with my team is, so long as they are not missing meetings and hitting their deadlines, I don&#x27;t care if they take a day or two during the week to work from home.
 Taking a note from my military experiences and what i saw at another company, I&#x27;ve got approval this year to implement automatic career promotions through a combination of tenure and requiring certifications common at for someone in that role.
 So, what are compelling benefits and events that motivate you?

                              <span>I have been a Sysadmin for a while now. But with every job I’ve had I have ran into weeks of coding new websites with DB queries and using python and just overall programming a lot. A friend of mine offered me a job with a 20% raise to learn on the job and get to work alongside him. 
 I learn quickly on almost anything I do being 24 I have went to from MSP 20% raise-&gt; Regional SysAdmin 40% raise within 3 years. now this programming job seems to be right up my alley. I’m good with the workflow and would never have to touch a printer again! Haha. 
 If you were in my shoes would you do?
 I’m also trying to think of longevity for the career itself. Will sysadmins always be needed once everything moves to cloud or before MSP’s wipe out the lower level items. I’m just not to far versed in whether the career itself is better for the long run. 
 Any ideas would help.

 So she accused him of sexual harassment and escalated this. He did not sexually harass her. I know this for multiple reasons. He would never do this because he&#x27;s ultra professional and I doubt he even talked to her about anything other than work.
 But beyond this, he is actually extremely gay (and very guarded about it). He isn&#x27;t into women. At all.
 So she is full of shit.
 This is the sort of bullshit I have to deal with in IT management.
 edit: are people here too young to get the moved my cheese phrase? its a book, a horrible book, google it

                              <span>So I&#x27;m better now, live elsewhere and I&#x27;m on long term disability for...not sure for how long. 
 I miss my old IT career of 24 years.
 I don&#x27;t know how to restart. When I had my strokes I was doing desktop and server support as well as migrating hundreds of users to the cloud (email wise - local exchange to office 365).
 Where/how should I start looking? I really wanna get back to my career again and I&#x27;m not too proud to be the guy who brings coffee every morning :)
 Thanks guys/gals!

I&#x27;ve tried using vssadmin to remove the shadow copies and readjust the shadow copy space usage but I keep being told access denied. Here&#x27;s the error (this is being ran as administrator):
 Error: Snapshots were found, but they were outside of your allowed context. Try removing them with the backup application which created them. 
 I don&#x27;t have a backup application in use. I&#x27;ve never set up Server Backup on this machine. The only thing I can think of is when I was having issues where snapshots weren&#x27;t able to be deleted on the VM host for this specific VM guest. I read that VMware Tools will use VSS. That issue has been resolved but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s related and not resolved on the guest.

                              <span>Just a reminder, a good job let’s you put family first. 
 My daughter was born at 34 weeks last week. Well before I had planned to take time off. 
 Sure, we had done some pre-planning for this, and I was prioritizing the hell out of a couple projects in the lead up. The only messages I’ve sent to anyone from work since it happened were either HR stuff like getting her added to insurance, and letting my coworkers know everyone is okay. 
 I won’t do another bit of work until September. There was no fuss from my boss. My direct reports were ready to go on taking over what they could. Nothing will catch fire. Nobody is gonna call my personal number. Im on 16 weeks of parental leave. Yes I’m in the US. Companies do exist that are not complete shit. 
 I actually changed jobs looking for a company like this. I asked about paternity leave before I would even take a first interview. I was able to go into this job from the start saying that family came first always. And I have never had a seconds pushback. 
 It’s routine for people to take unschedule WFH days if a kid is not feeling well. IT is actually the most hybrid of teams at the company. (Except the junior desktop support guys, sorry, need someone to swap keyboards when users spill coffee ). 
 I left my old job when I got laughed out of the room for asking for the same 12 weeks they gave women. 
 IT is a fairly small fraction of any company. Makes unionization tricky. But all of us can, when practical for our situations, demand better of employers. Part of that is making sure we get and use benefits we want. Part of that is setting boundaries.

One of the main things I want is to be able to have it print out QR codes to stick on each piece of equipment so it can be scanned in and out. Right now we have an inventory system with the ticketing system we use called happyfox but I can&#x27;t see any feature in that which can generate a qr code to be stuck on the asset.

Their role is going to be building laptops, configuring tablets and mobile devices and maintaining them (AV, updates, via an RMM, that sort of thing), 1st line support, keeping our asset register up-to-date, day to day stuff, and me there to help them, develop them, and give them opportunities.
 I’d really like to hire someone who is “into” tech, can demonstrate an ability to carry out this sort of work on their own ability and initiative, and who doesn’t n…</span>

                              <span>I know it shouldn&#x27;t call it BIOS anymore. The moment I get my hands on it I switch it to UEFI mode. I like UEFI, I know about the security issues but it&#x27;s so much more modern and I just hope the developers can resolve/limit the security risks. (also crossing fingers for an open source UEFI firmware - go coreboot! go!)
 It&#x27;s about the pronunciation: UEFI. These two vocals in the beginning. It&#x27;s killing me, they are so hard to pronounce in a fluid conversation ... so I slip and say: BIOS.
 &quot;We have to make a BIOS update.&quot;
 &quot;Go into the BIOS and see if you can find the setting for ...&quot;
 How do you handle it?
 I thought of using the term &quot;firmware&quot;. But when I say &quot;please make a firmware upgrade&quot; firmware can mean so much: BMC firmware, SSD firmware, CPLD firmware, GPU firmware, ... it&#x27;s confusing. So I slip and say: BIOS.
 I contemplate dropping the U from UEFI and just call it EFI. That would be easy to pronounce and after a while everyone should know what I mean by it. Only Apple admins will get rattled: &quot;You say EFI but then you refer to PC servers, I&#x27;m confused ...&quot;

 However, the SATA PWR Slot inside are 4 very close to each other Pins -&gt; https://i.imgur.com/KBRkFMQ.png and I&#x27;m not sure what kind of cable I need. The full model should be the fujitsu futro s900 g-t44r.

 The issue is that Microsoft desktop applications cannot complete the sign-in process properly. It is particularly noticeable in Outlook where autodiscover to https://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml fails.
 Web apps and sign in are unaffected by this issue, it is only happening with the desktop applications.

                              <span>We&#x27;re finally implementing a ticket system at work because I&#x27;m getting some additional manpower in the support department. The plan is to have an e-mail address &quot;support@ourcompany.com&quot; that pumps the tickets into the ticketing system (osTicket) and only accepts mail from us to prevent other people from creating random tickets.
 The support of our mail hoster said we could create rules for this using the Sieve language. I&#x27;ve tried multiple variations that should imo get this done, but it&#x27;s not working.
 Current version of the script:
 if address :contains :domain &quot;from&quot; [&quot;ourcompany.com&quot;, &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot;, &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot;] { keep; stop; } else { discard; } 
 I&#x27;ve tried with :matches :domain and with :contains :all but sending test mail from an outlook.com address still lets through the e-mail. I also tried with if not address ... discard; but that yields the same, unsatisfying, result.
 Has anyone run into this before?
 Edit: I accomplished what I wanted to do, even if not in the exact way I&#x27;d have liked.
 I created two ticket filters in osTicket to do this. I need two filters because if I only apply the second filter, all e-mail gets rejected for some reason and no tickets are created.
 Filter 1: &quot;E-Mail accept&quot; 
 Priority: 1 Stop execution on filter match: Yes Filter any of criteria: User Email contains &quot;ourcompany.com&quot; User Email contains &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot; User Email contains &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot; Do: Set help topic to &quot;Support&quot; 
 Filter 2: &quot;E-Mail reject&quot;
 Priority: 2 Stop execution on filter match: No Filter any of criteria: User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany.com&quot; User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot; User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot; Do: Disable notification on new ticket Discard ticket

                              <span>We’ve been experiencing this issue for quite some time now. Users are starting to get really frustrated and I don’t blame them.
 Basically, Teams calls are lagging/stuttering/freezing when users are connected to office LAN. There doesn’t seem to be an obvious pattern to this - it can happen when on a call with a small number of people and also large. It will happen with both audio and video calls. It’s random, happening for all users, even when connected to the office WiFi. 
 Users working remotely don’t experience this problem. We can have people outside the office on the same call as those in the office, and only those in the office get this issue (affects everyone on the call in the office at same time). It’s making it impossible to have a reliable conversation over Teams when physicall…</span>

 Tried and just amazed all function is just like a commercial edr solution.
 But I don&#x27;t think a &quot;opensource&quot; edr can really deployed into corporate environment. Furthermore the portal is just managed service.
 Does anyone have tried/deployed OpenEDR in their environment?

                              <span>I’m essentially an IT consultant, and the place I stay in Zimbabwe has awful internet. They currently have 25mbps for 12 rooms, and right now I’m getting into UniFi networking so I’m getting more involved with this space for them.
 The whole place is concrete and there are no access points except two, one in a room at the end of an L block and one in a kitchen that is where the L meets. They will never install ACs in every room (and they change the configuration of the rooms almost every time I come back, it’s a Zimbabwean thing).
 So, the internet gets so bad that we can’t even load websites, and while I know they could be doing stuff to help, they’re thinking simply upping from 25 to like 40mbps would do the trick. So I have to ask, how does one determine what is the right amount to purchase? Or is 25mbps actually fine and the bad speeds are only due to the poor planning on their ACs?

                              <span>I am working on a project that uses a spool of ethernet cable on a modified hose reel which can be wound in and out. One end is connected to a device which reads gas composition and dropped down a hole about 100 feet. The other end is plugged into my laptop where I can view live readings. This connection must be made and the device turned on manually at the surface, before it is dropped, so I cannot unplug the connection to the laptop at any time. 
 The problem I have is that while the cable is being unwound and the device lowered down the hole, the cable end going to my laptop is simultaneously spinning/twisting up. If it drops 100 feet, there&#x27;s suddenly 70 or so windings in my 6 ft of ethernet cable between the laptop and the spool of cable. 
 Can you think of any solution to this? I essentially hand wind/spin the cable in the opposite direction 50 times or so every time I connect to the spool so it minimizes the problem but I am looking for an elegant solution. Perhaps some kind of preload spring/spool that keeps it wound in the opposite direction or a special highly-rotatable cable or something. Any ideas would be appreciated! 
 Also, any ideas for a powered winch which holds 200 ft of cat7? I&#x27;ve been looking at anchor winches but they only seem to hold 100 ft of .20 rope. Also looking at modifying a harbour freight winch, but I need to solve this current problem of the cable twisting first.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a tool that does the following:
  
Auto discovery of network elements
 
Visual representation of the network
 
Dynamically update the graph based on link status. If a link goes down, the line between two routers turns red.
 
 I used to use Intermapper but I was wondering what else is out there and what works well.

                              <span>Hi
 I have aruba central with 3 aruba access points in my office.
 The aruba central is configured with ceritifcates for login to the primary ssid.
 I have a guest ssid as well that people can connect to it using just a password.
 I want to know if i can use this device for extending the strength of the wifi so people could use this &quot;home device&quot; extender ( just for the guest ssid that is being used for connecting with a password)

 Ty very much

                              <span>Hello r/networking!
 We’re in the process of setting up our network in a small environment (under 100 employees). 2x firewalls, 2x core switches, 2x edge switches, and 2x DC switches. Basically, the essentials.
 We want to grow this tiny plant, provide enough sunlight and water it daily in order to reach the heavens, and its roots heavily planted. In other words, an anti-fragile beast that can stand the test of time.
 To achieve that, we obviously have to follow some steps. Solid configurations, backup policies, physical security, insightful monitoring… etc.
 There’s one big issues, though. I don’t know where to start. I’m capable of learning nonetheless. 
 So, my questions (and humble requests) to you, esteemed network engineers, what are some resources I can use to build a strong base for our network? I.e. best practices.
 What are the must have’s, and the good to have’s? Should we just buy every buzzword solution that are out there, or just stick with the essentials and call it a day? But what we can call essential and what we can call superficial? For example, is a NAC solution a must have? What about an IPAM?
 Again, I’m reaching out to the ocean of knowledge that’s you hoping for an answer (or an advice) to some, if not all, of my questions. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all,
 Certificate management is one of my weaknesses. Our domain root CA needs to be renewed shortly. Can this be managed in a cloud based environment (e.g. Azure)? Currently we have a dedicated server for our root CA and another for a CA. If this can be managed in a cloud environment without dedicated virtual machines, that would be great.
 Thanks

                              <span>Currently I use an encrypted password file (Some powershell password module) to run my automated scripts on our tools server. If we change the password for that service account, I have to change the file (not a huge deal) but I would like to find a way for this to be autonomous. In that the password rotates every 3 months or so and instead of there being an encrypted file on the server, it reaches out to say Azure Keyvault or something (This is where my ignorance shows).
 ​
 I know there is Jenkins, Github CI etc but not sure where to start. Was hearing good things about Github CI.
 ​
 Would also like to rotate the service account passwords for accounts that run flows (they have premium licenses on them)
 ​
 Only thing here is that changing the password breaks the flows as the connections need to be rebuilt with the current password. Is there a way to have them reach out to key vault or something similiar instead?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in IT at the same (small) company for nearly 2 decades. My technical title was sysadmin but it was everything from device deployment/management to end-user support to enterprise networking to you name it. It truly is a thankless job but I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, loved my co-workers, and made decent money.
 I have accepted a new job which I start Monday doing cloud architecture for clients. No more end-users, no more printers, no more on-call, 100% remote, and most importantly a 50% RAISE (plus 10% yearly bonus)! Not to mention paid certifications in everything Azure and AWS. And if I have an IT problem I get to be the end-user and call the helpdesk, lol. 
 Is this it? Did I finally make the big time?! It all feels kinda surreal...
 EDIT: I didn&#x27;t expect this to blow up like it did. Sorry if I haven&#x27;t responded to you. I&#x27;m about to head to bed but I&#x27;ll try to get to everyone tomorrow. Thanks for all the well wishes!

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone has any experience with software that can provide certificates to clients similar to SecureW2 but perhaps via FLOSS like OpenSSL. I know this can be done with Microsoft Intune as well but that seems to focus on managed devices like company assets. I am wondering about something that can be used for devices not in the control of the enterprise but that are used on their Wifi infrastructure (like students at a campus for instance). I think getting the certificate is not difficult however the missing piece seems to be with how to easily get the certificate installed and the wifi network configured to use it for EAP-TLS. There are many client types (Windows, OSX, Android, etc) so it would have to work across a breadth of devices. Any direction would be appreciated.

                              <span>Granted I am relatively new to being a salaried employee. I got my first salaried position a year ago and have now had two. It always felt kinda like a scam unless the company would also very open about &quot;If your work is done just go home/log off&quot;. If they expect me to be available 40 hours then I&#x27;m doing 40 and not a second more.
 I work to support the rest of my life and reach my financial goals. The position I have now I took because it paid the most of all of my offers. Why would I work for free, essentially reducing my salary per hour?

                              <span>I’ve had three phone calls so far, claiming to be from Dell, Veeam and another tech company I forget, all asking to confirm my name, job and email. They seemed genuine, what with giving me my email address over the phone, but once I got WD’s mail, I knew what was going on. 
 They all asked if they could email me something, so it seemed like they’re just building a database. Expect more targeted spam or spearphishing.

                              <span>I’m a Helpdesk manager who has been in tech for 5.5 years, supervisor for 2 and manager for 1 of those years. Worked for a global international corporation for 4 of those 5 years. I really can’t see myself working for another MSP again and I would love to specialise in something else. Thinking maybe devops or cloud admin but the problem is that I don’t have any experience in these fields. A lot of my technical skills are for very specific out of date technologies which no one uses anymore. Helpdesk was fun but I feel like I’ve lost interest in this field and I’m dreaming of something bigger and better. I would have absolutely loved to be CTO one day but with this setback and my age of 35 I feel like that’s a dream which is fading. If there’s any silver lining, the redundancy package is pretty good so I have a good several months to live off without being desperate so I could upskill. I genuinely feel like I’ve ruined my career by being so focused on getting promoted in a Helpdesk which is so irrelevant. Any advice or if anyone who has been in this situation before could shed some light would be very much appreciated.

Depending on what service/tool they are asking access to, an email goes to their manager or the service owner. Once they approve it, the user gets added to the AD group. 
 Is there any third party alternative that we can use to simplify this process? Any tool or something that you guys are using to handle such requests.

                              <span>Hi to the folks at r/sysadmin, I would like some advice on a few subjects:
 ​
  
For quite some time, the team was trying to find a resiliency solution for some of the software that is used in the company. The software is monolithic &amp; can&#x27;t run in multiple instances. So, we&#x27;re forced to deploy new hardware to each location. My idea would&#x27;ve been to consolidate all of the hardware onto a pair of powerful servers (one located at our offices, the other one off-site) and virtualize all 100+ machines onto these servers – that way, if one of these VM servers were to fall over, the team would be able to rapidly spin up a new server &amp; get the branch up and running very quickly (15 minutes max). this idea got shot down. 
 
We use a mix of local AD, Google Workspace &amp; M365 as our environment. I&#x27;ve been trying to convince both my team lead (who&#x27;s the IT manager) and boss (the CIO/CTO) to try and unify everything under one vendor for ease of deployment, management &amp; troubleshooting for the long term – once again, the idea got shot down. 
 
All our infrastructure is not managed by any form of MDM, I pitched this idea, and it got promptly shot down. 
 
 I really like the current workplace, but trying to convince them to change/rebuild the current infrastructure for the better, just results in resistance from them. I’ve tried to talk to them to see why they are resisting change/shooting down any ideas. the only reasons that I got from the CIO/CTO was that it&#x27;s due to financial &amp; &quot;if it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it&quot; reasons. So far, I’ve been unsuccessful in trying to get *any* ideas to stick.
 Any advice on how to approach this?
 (P.S. this is my 2nd proper job as I had to leave the 1st one due to health reasons. Also, excuse the weird formatting; LibreOffice &amp; Reddit&#x27;s new UX don&#x27;t like each other a bit)

                              <span>Are there any places considered &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; when it comes to working in IT? Places that are generally considered a last resort to people so to say? I&#x27;ve always considered schools as a bottom of the barrel, however, i have no reason to think that. I also view MSPs as that, because I hear a lot of horror stories from there.
 I&#x27;m aware this is probably personal opinion but just seeing what everybody else thinks

 Fully remote org. I’m implementing an internal IT function. There are several users popping in requests for Google accounts for collaborating with other orgs that are using Google. Most of them have been creating personal gmail accounts.
 At my previous gig we were a Google shop and needed Microsoft 365 for some folks. We had onprem AD and were able to sync logins across all platforms. Am I crazy for thinking we can do the reverse in this case? We have azure ad instead of onprem. I would imagine I can disable gmail and restrict Google drive to make sure we maintain data governance, but that is all conjecture at this point as I’ve never done it before.
 Any thoughts from people who have done it before? Will disabling gmail totally break other apps? I’m probably missing a lot but open to suggestions. My team thinks we should investigate the use cases more as there’s a perception we don’t really need Google accounts to collaborate like this. They may be right but it could end up being more work trying to walk multiple external orgs through proper sharing processes so we can work with them.

                              <span>Me: Logs into server to move some files around. Carelessly mentions out loud, &quot;dang, server is crawling today.&quot;
 Suit guy within earshot: &quot;What&#x27;s going on, there&#x27;s a problem with the server?&quot;
 Me: &quot;yeah, it&#x27;s just really slow, see look.&quot;
 Suit: &quot;Is this our production server?&quot;
 No, it&#x27;s Dev.
 But we do work on Dev, correct?
 Uh, yeah, people use it if that&#x27;s what you mean.
 Whatever is causing it to malfunction, I want this fixed immediately. Today.
 I&#x27;m kind of slammed today, probably Monday looking better.
 Listen to me, I cannot afford delays on my project, whatever else you are working on can wait.
 Yeah, definitely, I&#x27;ll make sure it&#x27;s fixed today. Suit walks away. *Reboots server*
 Later that day: Hey Steve, I got that server fixed man, just had to toggle the RAM allocation to CPU cache, and run the bitwise script on the hard drive. Thing is running like new again.
 Okay sounds good, have a good weekend.

                              <span>Hey everyone. 
 I work as a system admin and ERP Administrator, I also serve as the technical lead for the team. Our company is looking to bring in some new hires to fill vacant positions. 
 I&#x27;m still notably green, as I&#x27;ve only been in this position for ~2 years. The positions we&#x27;re hiring for will likely require assistance with learning skillsets that either I have just started learning, or will have to learn with them. 
 Additionally, I&#x27;ve never had reporting employees that I&#x27;ve had to train before. 
 Could you please share any advice/resources you have on training new hires? What has worked for you, what hasn&#x27;t?
 Viewpoints from the eyes of the trainee are appreciated too!
 Thank you :)

                              <span>I think the answer to this is going to be &quot;no&quot;, but before I declare defeat I wanted to run this past everyone to see if you have any ideas. Here&#x27;s the situation:
  
The platform is M365 / Exchange Online.
 Currently, a number of teams share a generic user mailbox.
 If a user needs the mailbox on a mobile device, they currently just have the user mailbox added as the only mailbox.
 This situation is historic from many years ago.
 Compliance requirements are now forcing the organisation to ensure all users authenticate with unique credentials. It&#x27;s obviously also a good idea from a general infosec perspective and will ensure M365 licensing is correct, so it&#x27;s helpful that compliance is finally forcing the change.
  
To achieve this, we will create each user an AAD account with a license app…</span>

 ​
 I have short question. we have 300+ zones in our DNS environment. If I set the TTL time to 5 minutes will there be any negative impact on DNS Server?
 is it likely that the 5 minute TTL is being ignored outright, because of fast flux countermeasures?
 ​
 thanks in advance,

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve recently been bought out of a permanent contract and I&#x27;m scouting the market for a good next job. Turning on the LinkedIn &quot;open to work&quot; setting flooded my DM&#x27;s with recruiters looking for their next finders fee. Needless to say I&#x27;ve spoken with quite a few and some have been helpful and others talk about themselves for 40 minutes and tell you that they&#x27;ve never hear of an MSP before.
 What are your surreal recruiter conversations you&#x27;ve had in these cramped markets?

                              <span>I just accepted a position with a company a 4.5 hour drive away. I start Monday. They just sent me the benefits information and I just discovered that there are no in-network doctors where I live. That means I&#x27;ll have to pay a co-pay for everything, even an annual physical, and if I ever need a prescription, need to see a specialist, or have an emergency, that will likely wipe out all of the raise I&#x27;m getting by taking this job as well as money I&#x27;m saving by not commuting.
 For any non-Americans trying to parse the above paragraph: yes, our health system is as fucked up as you&#x27;ve heard. If you ever have a politician in your country suggest changing your health system to be more like ours, hang them from the nearest tree.
 So what else did &quot;they&quot; not tell me about working remotely?

 We are looking to set Ecosia as our default search engine for the user base, and although I have added it to the list of search engines using Group Policy I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to set the &quot;Search engine used in the address bar&quot; option, it never changes from Bing. Is there a specific policy or registry key I&#x27;ve missed for this? I&#x27;d have thought it would be simple!
 Thanks.

 I don&#x27;t know which NAS yet but I mean enterprise like say NetApp rather than Synology/QNAP/FreeNAS type stuff. 
 I know there isn&#x27;t a right answer to this so I&#x27;m interested why you&#x27;d go in either direction.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made a few purchases of drives directly from Western Digital. Someone here pointed out that their online store and RMA systems were off-line for several days, presumably because of a ransomware incident. Their e-Commerce site has been off-line for 6 weeks .
 I just received an email from WDC notifying me of an &quot;incident&quot; involving their on-line store. My purchase data has been compromised.
 ​
  
The information included customer names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers. As a security measure, the relevant database stored, in encrypted format, hashed passwords (which were salted) and partial credit card numbers.
  
No word on how this happened, but I think the working assumption is that a WDC employee opened an infected file that allowed the ransomware to run through their systems.
 WDC provides these &quot;helpful tips&quot; to people whose data was compromised:
 ​
  
As a precautionary measure, you can take the following steps to help protect your personal information from potential misuse: 
 + Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information. 
 + Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. 
 + Check whether your email account has spam settings to help you detect or block suspicious emails. 
 We hope this information is useful to you
  
​
 Gee, thanks, WDC. You do the same, M-Kay?

                              <span>I work at a mid size non profit and we use an IT vendor to manage our network and computers. We have a mix of ITaaS and HaaS agreements with them but I’m looking to purchase more equipment elsewhere when needed because it’s often much cheaper and I’d rather us own the equipment and not get locked into rental agreements. 
 We’re opening a new office and now I find out they will not let us purchase a firewall. We have to rent one from them in a 5 year agreement that’s about twice the price than if I purchased elsewhere. They say it’s because they lump in the IT management fee for the firewall in the rental price. 
 Is this reasonable or common practice? I don’t see why we can just buy a firewall and pay them a management fee. 
 Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;ve asked this question before on other subs, but none have been able to figure it out.
 I have two fairly old Macs desktops, running windows, and I&#x27;m trying to wipe everything and just use Linux (Ubuntu).
 I&#x27;m struggling with getting them to boot from USB. I&#x27;ve tried ventoy (not supported on Macs), and making a bootable USB through Linux mints&#x27; standard &quot;make a bootable USB&quot; option. Both give me &quot;secure boot 14&quot; error. But googling that gives we information about windows?
 At this point I just want to nuke the machines, wipe everything and just have Ubuntu. I don&#x27;t care about the windows partition because it runs too slow to be of any use anyway. There is no important data on them as the owners have resorted to just using their laptops.
 One machine has only windows on it, and it was still stuck at the splash screen after leaving it overnight. The other has a working windows OS on it - this is the main one I&#x27;m trying to save. Both throw up the same &quot;secure boot 14&quot; error.
 And to top it all off, they&#x27;re all using Chinese language operating systems. So I&#x27;m reliant on Google translate from my phone to figure stuff out.
 Just for laughs: one of the business owners suggested solving the problem by buying a third Mac, and putting windows on it. Before throwing the keyboard at them (metaphorically speaking), I enquired as to why they:
 1) didn&#x27;t just use Mac OS in the first place because they just use it for excel, word, and Photoshop 2) didn&#x27;t use a windows based machine 3) thought that buying a third Mac would solve the problem
 They don&#x27;t know how to use Mac OS; Macs look nicer; a new Mac would be faster.

                              <span>We were looking at the potential use case of having Active Directory Cloud Sync through the Microsoft Azure P1 plan but changed our minds after checking out the annual cost per user. We prefer to go a different route which is: 
 1) Having a cloud Active Directory server privately hosted, either in GCP, AWS, or some other cloud instance provider.
 2) On premise AD server connect to Cloud AD
 3) Google Workspace synchronization with our Cloud ADWe want the workflow to be - having the Private AD Cloud server, communicating only to two destinations, the on-premise AD server(s), and Google Workspace for LDAP synchronization which will be used for the overall user and password management using Google Workspace as the MFA service and SSO identity.
  
What is the feasibility of having this solution?
  What challenges should we expect? 
 What security precautions should we take for the Cloud AD? 
 Should we add a dedicated WAF to prevent intrustion and DDOS attacks? 
  
Any help would be appreciated, thanks

                              <span>I currently find that I spend most of my day responding to trouble tickets re: networking lately.
 1st step in the process is to to request a bidirectional MTR from the problem to the problem.
 Been thinking of how to expedite this process. Thought of making a video, &quot;How to run a bidirectional MTR&quot; but seems like there are a thousand already... Then thought, I should make a website that you put in the start and end ips of the route to test, and it runs the mtr for you and gives you the results...but there seem to be many of those as well. What tools does anyone here use? There has to be faster way, I spend half my time requesting an mtr, the other half explaining what it is and how to generate one...Any tips appreciated.

                              <span>Right now, we have a mixture of cat5e and cat6 running throughout the building (added over the years). During the last big addition, we tried to future proof, but now we are moving the server room so we are re-wiring. We are an entertainment facility. About 60% of our network bandwith is multicast traffic as all of our projectors/tvs get the data from a few VM&#x27;s powered by Proxmox as well as HDMI to RTSP encoders. By the end of the summer, we are increasing the number of TVs/projectors from 23 to about 35-37, while also increasing our in-house tv channels that are being broadcast from our proxmox servers. Right now, all the content (other than Comcast) is being fed from our Synology server). I am worried about that being a bottleneck as it may need to feed 10 1080p/4k files continuously to each VMs to be broadcast... Our Synology is also our file server and at times it is definitely slow. (I can&#x27;t add a cache drive to it)
 If I decide to go 10gig, then I will also be spec&#x27;ing out another server with some SSD&#x27;s in it or at least able to add some SSD cache..
 If I decide to not go 10gig, I will still be looking to get a bigger NAS. Just not sure which way to go...
 Also currently, it is 8:30pm on Saturday night and we have 235 devices connected to our network.. (Our high is about 430 devices).

                              <span>Need some help here with understanding Unifi’s guest captive portal capabilities. The documentation I’ve been able to find is rubbish and I don’t have a Unifi network to test on… not a great start. 
  
Can it do T&amp;Cs + Email authentication (no password, just collecting email for marketing purposes)?
 If not, is there a list somewhere of supported third party hotspots, or is it possible to DIY one?
 Can the captive portal operate without a controller (i.e run on an AP) or can it run using the cloud controller, or do you have to have a dream machine/physical controller on-prem?
  
Unifi wouldn’t be my first choice, so if anyone has thoughts on cheap-ish no controller access points that can serve a decent captive portal, (commercial solution, not openwrt etc) would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have a general question about the vm live migration implementation. Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask.
 It&#x27;s more or less clear to me how the VM can be live migrated from one physical host to another by copying and then syncing disk / RAM as well as state of VM&#x27;s NIC and other &quot;hardware&quot;.
 However, between the client and host there is a non-trivial number of stateful networking equipment. Once you move the VM to another host, new network route will involve different equipment which is unaware of the preexisting connections.
 How is it achieved that existing TCP connections to the VM are preserved without an interruption? Are there scholarly articles that explore approaches of proprietary vendors such as vMotion in detail?

                              <span>I am a little confused with the segmentation of voice data. 
 I learned that you would want to segment VoIP traffic from Client Data traffic and that you can daisy chain a desk-phone to a PC and configure VLAN and Voice VLAN on the switch. 
 We have Cisco MS Merakis at work. 
 How do i segment voice traffic if we implement soft phones running on the clients?
 Through the VLAN and Voice VLAN setting? 
 My idea is that i could enable port isolation on the Switches if i cant segment VoIP and data traffic. That way no other Client should be able to sniff their packages am i right? 
 Thanks in advance

 I need to get ip adresses of a domain to do some traffic filtering. How to approach the case of updating the ip adreesses after expiration such that the rule which filters the traffic to still be applied?
 For example, dig +short www.google.com gives me an ip address. Is TTL field the time after the IP address is changed and I should get the ip again?
 My thinking is to do a cronjob which is running every TTL seconds and writes ip adresses in a file, then I compare the current result with the adresses from that file. If the adresses are changed it means the ips were changed. Is my approach correct?

 During a test the coverage at 2.4 and 5GHz is the same. I&#x27;m not an expert and I don&#x27;t see the difference.
 I&#x27;ve seen the supported users for every radio is very different, the configuration is more detailed in the Huawei interface.
 Can I&#x27;ve your opinion?

                              <span>Good evening,
 I was wondering if anyone has experience configuring a FortiGate firewall to pass routes with NSX-T. Any assistance would be appreciated. 
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>A series of recent reports have alleged improprieties against Supreme Court Justices, particularly Clarence Thomas. Court critics allege a failure to disclose financial information and conflicts of interests, while defenders of the court say this is a biased effort to intimidate the conservative-majority court. We speak with Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network and author of “Justice on Trial: the Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” about the string of allegations against the justices.

I am an IT Director with a strong hands-on technical background. I started about 6 months ago working for a small enterprise, family owned, about 10 locations globally, ~1000 employees and contractors. My boss the CIO started only 6 months before me, and my position was newly created. I have 4 full time staff working for me, 3 young helpdesk people, and one systems/network engineer. Plus a number of consultants and MSP&#x27;s we work with for various things. The workload is very, very high and demanding, but I&#x27;m used to that sort of thing. There is a great deal of end-user related support, but also a fair amount of enterprise networking and on-prem data center stuff (server room), nothin…</span>

                              <span>Have a few Hyper-V and each hosts 50+ VMs.
 Occasionally, need to reboot some VMs manually. Current setup is through the RMM software installed on Hyper-V host: staff on allowed list send an email with title like &quot;reboot vm 120&quot; to an internal email, then a powerautome kicks in, sends an api request to rmm server, rmm server then send a job to a rmm agent that executes a reboot.
 This process works well, but it is a bit slow. Often takes about 10 - 15 minutes.
 How to make it faster?
 Staff is on another vlan, can give access to hyper-v host&#x27;s vlan. 
 Cannot give staff credentials to hyper-v host.
 Thanks.

 Any users of Coro made these changes?

                              <span>I know we all fight to get advance notice when HR is going to fire someone, but it really sucks when they tell you Friday afternoon that one of your friends is going to be fired Monday.
 I don’t really have anyone that I can share this with that would truly get how much this sucks, so I thought I’d post it here.

                              <span>I was sick and tired of getting all these fake &quot;EFT Remittance&quot; emails sent to my clients. You know the ones, they have a HTML file attachment that takes you to a fake O365 login that steals your password.
 I decided to create an Exchange mail rule to block any email that has an .HTML attachment (and others like .HTM). Bam, perfect. Stopped getting like 30 spam tickets a week.
 Today, I got an EFT Remittance email. The attachment? An .EML file!
 Can you guess what the EML file contained? That&#x27;s right - another fake EFT Remittance email with an HTML file inside!
 I feel defeated, I can&#x27;t block .EML attachments for obvious reasons. I enjoyed the silence while it lasted.

                              <span>Heaven help me, after 20 years of working for myself, and 7 years of corporate culture but in a small rural area... our board hired an outsider from a major city to come in and be our new President. They&#x27;ve already put things in motion to shoehorn our organization into how their last place was....
 Well last week and new HR director was hired also from a much larger corporation. And next week, what do you know, they are implementing an EDGE program. Education, Development, Growth and Engagement. 
 So of course, they want to do &quot;anonymous&quot; surveys, focus groups and one-on-one meetings. Well my meeting with the Bobs is next week. 
 Sigh. I just needed 15 more years to build out my 401K. Let&#x27;s pray this doesn&#x27;t piss me off that I need to take my antiquated self out looking for a new job!

                              <span>Sooo, our CFO just &quot;retired&quot; after over a decade, and no replacement was announced, which leads me to believe it was not voluntary. Our CEO is in his 80s and, while I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s an expert in his field (Bioinformatics) The C-Level execs don&#x27;t seem too IT savvy.
 Even my direct supervisor has openly stated he is more of a &quot;People Person&quot; than an technical expert. I just started about 10 months ago, and have been working on a project that has been ongoing for over a year and a half. We needed to re-architect the infrastructure to support Azure Kubernetes Service. And while things on the Infra side are pretty good, the application is still in development. I don&#x27;t think it will ever be done.
 We are also dealing with high turnover, and nobody seems to know what&#x27;s going on. There&#x27;s no structure, our ticketing system sucks. I&#x27;ve brought this up multiple times before, but nobody is willing to take on more work. 
 So at this point, with the CFO gone, I think there is going to be a lot more scrutiny of projects going forward. We finally hired some dedicated Project Managers, but at this point I&#x27;m kind of over all of it. I&#x27;m just waiting for the fireworks. Anyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!

                              <span>If so, your implementation of Exchange ActiveSync on Android is broken and out of spec.
 Every once in a while we&#x27;ll have some weird issue on Android where the device stops syncing, which can only be diagnosed by looking at the EAS logs. Most of the time it&#x27;s because Android is trying to add an OrganizerName attribute as a child element of Exception, which is unsupported and causes the calendar to stop syncing entirely.

 ...
 X-MS-ASError: Message &#x3D; The element &#x27;Exception&#x27; in namespace &#x27;Calendar:&#x27; has invalid child element &#x27;OrganizerName&#x27; in namespace &#x27;Calendar:&#x27;. List of possible elements expected: &#x27;Reminder, Categories, Sensitivity, Attendees&#x27; in namespace &#x27;Calendar:&#x27;.; Severity &#x3D; Error 
 At first I thought this was because our Exchange server is old and I&#x27;m holding up hopes that our Exchange Online migration would fix it. But I&#x27;m not sure I believe that since OrganizerName isn&#x27;t listed as a valid child element of Exception in the Microsoft Exchange documentation, either.
 Oh, and while I&#x27;m at it... sometimes Gmail will stop syncing for a user until I clear their out-of-office response. WTF?
 iPhone works perfectly fine. This is the polite version of the post, I could rant about what a PITA Android has been for me but I shouldn&#x27;t.

                              <span>Windows Server 2012 R2, I have checked the following:
  
No MS Services running with my account name
 
No scheduled tasks running with my account name
 
Nothing in IIS using my account name
 
 Can anyone suggest a tool that I could use to help figure out what on this server is trying to use my account name?
 EDIT: 
 Current theory is that another server I work on has some lingering connection it&#x27;s trying to authenticate on my troublesome machine. Plan is to turn off all of my dev servers that aren&#x27;t essential for keeping the environment up and running, hope that this stops the lockouts, then bring them back one by one until the lockouts start happening again.
 EDIT EDIT:
 After having multiple lockouts this morning, I&#x27;ve been free and clear since shutting down other servers. Starting to be confident that I&#x27;ll be able to determine which server is sending the request, but going to leave them down for the weekend to see if the trend continues.

                              <span>I am wondering who here has be playing around with the new Outlook interface, its the newest interface that makes Outlook look more like Windows 12. 
 My question is how do I add &quot;unread&quot; back to my favorites or has MS done away with it? :(
 Thanks,

                              <span>What is everyone using for no-auth smtp solutions. For example in this scenario our &quot;new&quot; HP Designjet Z6810 has a field for smtp ip address and a desired email address, but nothing else. I don&#x27;t have an smtp server which can do no auth so I was looking for a service. Preferably something with a free tier as this will send 100 emails a year tops.
 ​
 I&#x27;m sure someone in this sub has run into this silly problem.

                              <span>I recently changed jobs into a Sysadmin\Network Admin role. I am just getting a feel for the network and making small improvements like lldp broadcast, storm control, and syslog servers. I have run into a small issue and was wondering if anyone here has overcome it. I am used to Cisco switches, while these Dell switches run a form of Cisco iOS I am locked into read only mode with CLI. From what I have read unless you factory reset the switch that is the case all the time, even though there is a security checkbox to allow 15 level access over CLI, but when checked it goes right back to unchecked in the web gui. This makes a 20 second change in CLI to all interfaces take almost an hour clicking through the web UI and waiting on it to load each time. 
 ​
 Has anyone here found a way to write changes via CLI on these Dell switches other than factory resetting?

 ​
 I have also attempted to use the Powershell Module Set-DfsrMemberShip, but it results in the same problem. This method works on other machines; however, it occasionally fails, and no matter what I try, the issue persists.
 ​
 Our existing configuration is as follows:
 Server 1: On-Site Source
 Server 2: On-Site Destination
 Server 3: Data Center Backup
 ​
 The command functions properly between Server 1 and 2, allowing me to establish the local path. However, when I include Server 3, I can add it as a member, but I&#x27;m unable to execute Membership Set and configure the LocalPath.
 ​
 Command
 dfsradmin Membership Set /RgName:$DFSName /RfName:$DFSName /MemName:$DFSServer /LocalPath:$dfsServerRepFolder /MembershipEnabled:true /StagingSize:4096 /CDSize:4096 /IsPrimary:false
 ​
 Generic Error Message:

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Since the current translated subtitles in teams are not up to professional standards (misinterpreting company names and stuff) I’ve been looking into better working alternatives.
 I haven’t been able to find anything really, azure cognitive services seemed cool but damn, that’s a whole rabbithole 
 Does anyone have an idea? 
 It needs to be translated live and be displayed somewhat accurately. Or is the built-in teams version the best I’ll get?
 Thanks 😀

I&#x27;ve always use a 3rd party like Kaspersky endpoint security or ESET NOD32. What are y&#x27;alls experience with only relying on Microsoft defender, is it enough?

 Box and Synology are still working on the issue, and I believe are in some sort on dialogue.
 Synology developers posted in the Box Forum.
 Expanding on the behaviour they noticed, I played with the API url from the CloudSync authentication popup and worked out that modifying the &amp;state parameter to html-encode http:// to http%3A%2F%2F solves the problem. The modified URL needs to be loaded from the pop-up window, not from a different browser window, so a little console trickery is needed...
 Below are the steps to replicate my workaround: 
  
Open CloudSync
 Click the + icon to create a new link
 Select Box and click Next
 The popup authentication window appears (with the 403 Forbidden error)
 Copy the entire URL
 Pressed Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up the Browser Developer Tools
 Switch to the console tab
 Type the following into the console (note the single apostrophe at the end):
 self.location &#x3D; ‘
 Paste the URL copied in step 5
 Locate &amp;state&#x3D;http://x.x.x.x:5000 at the end of the URL and change it to:
 &amp;state&#x3D;http%3A%2F%2Fx.x.x.x:5000 (i.e. replacing the first : with %3A and each / with %2F. Don’t change anything else)
 Type a closing ’
 Press enter
 The Box authentication window should appear and you should be able to grant permission successfully.
 
 My sync is up and running after 8 days and lots of inconvenience.
 And now we wait for an official fix!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been patching Chrome and Firefox via SCCM for quite some time now and more recently started using Tenable security scanning. Tenable has been finding Chrome and Firefox installs in the C:\Users space which SCCM has not been targetting. The collections I have only find Chrome/Firefox in Program Files that SCCM itself would have deployed. I have now created some Configuration items to locate these user installs and I want to convert these to the enterprise browser versions. My issue is how do I handle bookmarks? If I uninstall the browser from the C:\User they will lose their bookmarks. I&#x27;ve been researching how to backup bookmarks and restore them in an automated way but I haven&#x27;t found a great answer. Has anyone else gone through this?

Every so often i run the “Unavailable Computers” query in log analytics to check up on the mma agent availability but i cannot get the email alerting to work. When i turn this query into an alert rule the preview shows 0 and no emails work. Suggestions?
 How is everyone monitoring these agents for disconnects or faulty services on the server?

 I&#x27;m relatively new to it, but we have reports generated for us which contain machines that have some issues. 
 How often does D365 perform a software inventory on devices? What is the initial or interval period?
 Is there a way to check when it was last conducted?
 How long does that device information stay in D365?
 Many thanks to anyone that can provide some advice or guidance

                              <span>Heyho everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently in the planing phase for the replacement of a lot older thinclients in a warehouse enviroment. For the last 10-12 years the company went the way of buying refurbished/cheap used devices to replace the faulty ones since &quot;they are just thin clients&quot;. In the last 2 years of support for them, we had like 3 or 4 devices that failed. To be fair, some were straight up old and gave up mostly because of that, however the others suffered from enviromental problems. A warehouse is full of various kinds of dirt &amp; dust in the air that settles down everywhere. Employees touch things with dirty hands and so on.
 ​
 I thought it might be better to instead replace most TCs now with some higher quality devices (and switch at that time over to Igel OS) that last longer because they are designed for that enviroment. The devices mostly potray some old software, nothing newer that could push the hardware requirements. Some raspberry Pis could probably do the job ..
 ​
 So yeah .. Any recommendations?

How can I protect myself from getting viruses if the files they send me is through either online or in Flashdrives?

                              <span>I consider myself a decent programmer, but unfortunately, I lack experience in server administration and maintaining a production environment. Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve developed a web app that I want to bring live for field testing purposes. I&#x27;ve already set up a virtual server at Hetzner.com with a firewall and other security measures, such as disabling password logins.
 My application consists of:
  
NestJs/NodeJs backend
 Vue.js SPA frontend, which can be served by NestJs but also deployed independently
 Redis
 MongoDB
  
My plan is to run all of these components on a single virtual server for the testing phase (and as long as it is sufficient). I think I&#x27;ll use Docker for this setup.
 Do you have any suggestions/tips regarding this setup or thoughts on issues I may have missed? For example, regarding:
  
Logging and monitoring
 Do you recommend Docker for this setup?
 Any security measures I may have missed?
 Should I include Nginx as a reverse proxy, and why?
  
As I said this is my first own live environment and I&#x27;d really appreciate any suggestions and help.

                              <span>Hello,
 i am wondering if anyone has got this figured.
 We would like to use Roaming Profiles with Google Cloud Sync, currently the user needs to do this every now and again and with Mandatory Profiles they need to enable turn on sync every time. 
 The only way around this would be to change the location of chrome files which only allows one instance of chrome which does not work in our environment.
 i have enabled the policy for the new azure sync settings as well as signing on which works but does not turn on cloud sync that goes through another popup.
 i am wondering if anyone has any ideas how i can turn on Cloud Sync without user intervention or any policies or reg tweaks, any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, 
 We&#x27;re making our super-late upgrade from Exchange 2010 to 2016 (and after that to 2019), after inheriting an old environment and finding out updates not working. 
 After installing Exchange 2016 on a new server, we&#x27;ve ran into issues with migrating mailboxes: &quot;Unsupported source mailbox version Version 14.0 ‎(Build 639.0)‎.&quot;
 That version should stand for Exchange 2010 RTM. The 2010 server itself is supposed to be patched. 
 What I&#x27;ve checked:
 - In the EMC the server version shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot; - EMC is said to be inaccurate: Application binary versions (checked from the running store.exe location, no second wrong install locations) are 14.3.513.0, which should be the very last rollup of SP3
 - Get-ExchangeServer AdminDisplayVersion also shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot;
 - The current Exchange schema version is rangeUpper 15332 (or Exchange 2016 CU18)
 - The &quot;Exchange Servers&quot; AD group only contains current running (the 2010 and 2016) servers
 - In ADSIEdit, Configuration/Services/Microsoft Exchange/[domain]/Administrative Groups/Exchange Administrative Group (...)/Servers also only contains the current running servers
 What I&#x27;ve tried:
 - First, most of the instructions that were followed are from the Exchange Deployment Assistant
 - Trying to run the upgraded installer for 2010 just to be sure but it says nothing to upgrade
 - Searching for any non-installed updates through Windows update, including hidden ones - Restarted services and machines so no lingering processes should exist
 - Creating a new database on the 2010 server and moving mailboxes to it in case the database has an affected version as well 
 Misc:
 - We currently do not intend to move to Exchange Online
 My current understanding would be that mailboxes also have a version and have to be upgraded. How do I go about doing that? Otherwise, what issue am I not seeing?

 This leaves me and one other Snr Engineer as the sole people in our large Org with the &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;. Eg all the top level access.
 At what point do you trust a new boss with this? Normally with a new peer you would gradually provide more access as it was warranted and you trusted them more. With a boss, that dynmac is quite different.

 Zero Trust CloudFlare Tunnel
 Control Box is running on Port 9090
 Https is enabled from trusting origin in settings of CloudFlare
 Hi all,
 I am new with the whole Cloudflare side of things, so bare with me please 📷
 I have a phone system running iPECS eMG100
 It’s a control box running on my local network. I am trying to use a tunnel to log into it which works as I get the webpage looking for me to log in when i am out and about with my laptop
 I enter the details, and it logs me in but it’s only in “Read Only” mode
 When I log in locally, it logs me in with read / write and I can do the usual.
 I am logging in with the same administrator account with both through the tunnel and locally.
 Did any of you guys ever experience this with your tunnels and web admin panels? Is there some configuration settings that I might have missed in the setup in CloudFlare?

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid thirties and I&#x27;ve just finished being self employed for nearly eleven years. The job I did involved a lot of use of technology, from commissioning and deploying web apps, to building some little internal windows app of my own in autohotkey, to BEING the entire IT department for my small company...
 I&#x27;m ready to work hard and in a dedicated way - but this time for someone else.
 I&#x27;ve done all sorts of different things. I&#x27;m REALLY interested in technology and have been tinkering since I was about ten!
 I have used all sorts of systems over the years from Acorns at secondary school to CentOS now at home (in a homelab type setting). I&#x27;ve provided IT support for paying business/private customers, and have used Unix systems to cobble together working solutions for my own needs as and when.
 I&#x27;ve created/configured/used (these are examples) Asterisk (FreePBX), NodeRed, ESP32 microcontrollers, AutoHotkey, Home Assistant (writing the automations in YAML), Docker, Photoshop, MQTT, Excel.... I have some limited experience with tools such as Cron, SSH, I used to make websites for clients 20 years ago but wouldn&#x27;t have a clue what the in vogue framework is now...
 My IT skills are perhaps beyond 1st line tech support I&#x27;d say (tell me if you disagree!).
 I have an IT related master&#x27;s qualification - but it&#x27;s a few years out of date now, due to the time I&#x27;ve had &#x27;out&#x27; running my own business.
 I&#x27;d need to find somewhere that was willing to take a chance on a quick learner with a MASSIVE interest in tech and a track record of tinkering and experimenting, iterating and building projects.
 Any ideas where to start looking?
 Working remote is absolutely fine for me as I have a garden office at the end of the garden where I can go and just focus for the working day. No distractions.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking for advice, tips, leads at this point. Where should I be looking and how should I be tailoring my CV to (ideally) pivoting towards tech?
 THANK YOU!

                              <span>Our Mac print server recently died (the Mac mini would no longer successfully boot up) so we hurriedly set up a new one with Monterey and the latest Epson print drivers. Individually the printers all work fine but our follow-me print queue just produced a blank page on certain models (we have a mix of WF-C579R WF-C879R and WF-C20600). We raised the issue with PaperCut and they were able to quickly highlight that the cause is that the drivers are outputting ESCP instead of Postscript. 
 I know there&#x27;s a &quot;Generic Postscript&quot; driver on macOS but it&#x27;s my understanding that if we use this we lose access to printer features such as colour profiles, which are important as our Mac users are primarily Art &amp; Photography. 
 Is there a way to configure the Epson print driver on macOS to use / output Postscript?

                              <span>Hello and good morning!
 Apologies in advance if this is the worst post of the day, but I&#x27;m hoping my sysadmin family of Microsoft experts can help me as I&#x27;m a bit lost.
 Personally, I&#x27;m a Mac admin in a Google workspace environment with comparatively little knowledge of Office 365 other than creating users and licenses in our Office 365 instance for the small number of our team that can only to communicate with clients via Teams/OneDrive etc due to their security requirements.
 I have had a request through from a client to “make sure the external company adds Federation to the following SIP domains…” This in order to facilitate comms over Teams from our company to theirs, rather than the current clunky setup of client VMS / VPN.
 However I can’t find what I’m supposed to be looking for in the admin portal. Google searching tells me it&#x27;s something to do with some settings on our on-prem Skype server, but we obviously don’t have one of those, but that could also be because I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m searching for.
 If anyone has a couple of minutes to point me in the right direction I&#x27;d be super grateful

                              <span>Happy Friday everyone!
 Today I made the troubling discovery of a UPC/APC SC connector mismatch on the demarcation point of my company&#x27;s sole internet circuit. I remember learning that this was a big no no when I was in school, but that cable was installed 3-4 years ago prior to me working here and has remained connected ever since without any noticeable problems (from my perspective, at least), so what exactly are the concerns associated with this improper mating? For reference, the demarc has the APC connector (female) to which our ISP&#x27;s NID connects via a SC/UPC-terminated simplex fiber cable.
 The main reason for my asking is because I&#x27;m about to send a strongly worded email to our ISP telling them to get out here and fix it, but since I&#x27;ve never dealt with this before I don&#x27;t know what expectations I should have as a customer. Do they need to polish the demarc&#x27;s connector before they install the new cable, or should it be re-terminated? Do they need to bring an OTDR out and re-certify the connection? Etc, etc...

                              <span>Does user roles &amp; assignment management really have to be this difficult when using SSO on greenlake/central?
 Why can&#x27;t my SSO link my federated users to the portal, then allow the permissions to adjusted from the GreenLake side instead of jacking around with &quot;Azure sso - Attributes &amp; Claims&quot; withing the app sso for each role we create?
 Is this Legit or is there a better way to do this? We&#x27;re thinking about moving away from SSO due to this.

                              <span>We have much more teams these days that are spread across various locations and are uploading/downloading various source code files etc. 
 Lately we are seeing many issues with reported slow speeds when downloading files. WAN circuit is often 1Gbps using SdWan with the file download speed at 300-400kbps.
 Does anyone have good strategies for dealing with such issues?
 I used iPerf to run a test and this basically confirmed the issue for me. Now I need to figure out why it’s running so slow.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Apologies if this isnt the place for this post, but I am looking for a little bit of career guidance, or even just general options/paths y&#x27;all have taken in your careers in networking.
 A little bit of background on me, and what I currently do:
 I&#x27;m a 28 year old college grad (unrelated major), and currently work for a semi-major bandwidth provider in the Fiber/DWDM space. My day to day job consists of managing new builds, system extensions, grooms, and anything else needed to expand network capacity for new and existing customers. I&#x27;ve been in this role for ~ 3 years, and I&#x27;m somewhat lost on where to go from here. My background in Layer 2 is pretty limited, past a very basic understsanding of BGP/OSPF as it pertains to my current job. I have a lot of interest in learning more on that side of things, but Im unsure how I would go about that. I&#x27;m aware of certs like Net+, CCNA, CCNP etc. but I&#x27;m unusure if that would get me anywhere in network engineering without relelvant experience. 
 I&#x27;m hesitant to apply to NOC, Systems Admin jobs, simply because I would be looking at a significant pay cut (though I understand if that is a route I&#x27;d need to take to get my foot in the door). I also like the space I&#x27;m currently in, but don&#x27;t really know what my future options look like for Fiber Optic/Dwdm related jobs. 
 I&#x27;d love to hear opinions on potential career paths in Fiber/DWDM, and networking, and get some advice on next steps I should take in my career.

 Problem: A user who has not been on the network previously will attempt to connect to the Guest SSID. This is an open SSID that should load a guest captive portal page. When the user connects, they have no internet and are not able to load the portal page. If the user disables MAC randomization/Private IP address, they have internet and the guest page loads.
 We will keep trying to replicate the issue but I am hoping someone may be able to point us in the right direction or has some similar experiences in the past. Unfortunately it happened during a board meeting and on one informed us or provided us with any information. The problem seems to be very rare.

 We are currently running into issue with Cisco Meraki/OpenDNS setup. We have remote users and connted to internet using Meraki and users are unable to reach some of the site using Chrome/Edge. The users are getting error message like this site is not private and if you continue it will give the Cisco Umbrella &quot;This site is blocked due to content filtering&quot;. The strange part is, the site works fine with Firefox. I looked into cert on chrome and the cert is under Opendns. I tried updating chrome/removed cache and history, installed the cisco opendns root certificate nothing working.

                              <span>Hi,
 Looking to purchase some tools for inspecting and cleaning my LC fiber connections at home.
 Can anyone recommend some affordable tools for home user?
 If there is an inexpensive way to get photo of how clean the fiber is that would be great too! But if not manual tools will work.
 Amazon links appreciated but if something good is not available on amazon please still link it!
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, I need a dial-up provider who works in Europe (France) ?
 idk if NetZero/Juno/dialup4less/basicisp work in Europe?
 the NetZero Wikipedia says it works in Europe but I can only choose the American state on the NetZero website?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone. Scouring the internet and this is my last effort human to human. I’m running BISDN/yocto Linux on a small router. The image I’m currently using is built with FRR 8.2.2. Looking to work some BGP testing in a lab. Our prod devices are using FRR 6.0 so I want to roll back to match. Can anyone point me to a good work up of downgrading?!? I see the different packages and versions in the FRR repository but I can’t find any work up/walkthrough of how to blow away the current load and build back in the older version.
 Very much appreciated!

                              <span>I’m an IT tech and I recently did a project where we connected two switches together that are in separate buildings - about a mile apart. We used single mode fiber all the way through and installed a second line as a secondary. This was pre existing fiber infrastructure, I just patched things into the adjacent dark fiber patch panels to get from point A to point B. The second building is a new building and the patch panels are new. 
 I’m not very well versed in fiber and such but I did do a ping test from switch to switch and got under 1ms responses which I thought was all good. Now Network team conducted a TX/RX optical power test from the switches and found that we’re losing about -10db on the run on both lines and both ways. So right now our RX on both switches is around -13 to -16 db. So my question is, is this normal or is something seriously wrong and what is most likely the cause? The network team is making a big deal out of it and actively trying to make me look like I screwed up their network so I’m not sure how to respond. 
 Any advice appreciated.

 Obviously it&#x27;s Chunkhost and I&#x27;m not expecting an immediate response, but a week is ridiculous. Has anyone been able to reach them? It&#x27;s not a critical server or anything (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t host anything critical with them), but I am paying for a server that&#x27;s currently down and that&#x27;s not ok.
 Alternatively, if anyone has any suggestions for reaching someone over there, I would appreciate it.

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking into Silverfort for adding MFA to our on-prem including our service accounts. Curious what people&#x27;s thoughts are if anybody&#x27;s evaluated them. Also curious how they compare to Crowdstrike&#x27;s IDP module, Authlite, Duo, &amp; smart cards? Seems good (also maybe more coverage than Duo across powershell &amp; psexec) but a bit pricey...
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a folder on a file server(2019) that is shared with some information for an application that a vendor states we should limit user access to as much as possible. So for share permissions I have Everyone full control. For the NTFS permissions I have SYSTEM(FULL), LOCAL ADMINS(FULL), and DOMAIN COMPUTERS(READ). The LOCAL ADMINS group on the file server has domain admins inside of it. Everything is working fine and the application inside of it is being deployed without issue while at the same time no users have any access to the folder except DOMAIN ADMINS.
 Now the strange thing is if I&#x27;m on the file server with my domain admin account and I try to open the folder by either the filesystem or the share I get prompted with the message &quot;You don&#x27;t currently have permissions to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to the folder.&quot; Remember the local admins on the file server has the domain admins in the group. Not sure why it&#x27;s telling me I don&#x27;t have access. Now if I click continue it adds my DA account to the NTFS permissions explicitly. This is screwing up our folder permissions consistency. If I didn&#x27;t truly have access as the message stated how did it explicitly add my DA account with full control? That seems kind of messed up if that was really the case.
 One final note. If I&#x27;m on my office machine and run computer management as my DA connecting the file server and then navigate to the shares, when opening the folder I don&#x27;t get prompted with the message above. If I look at the NTFS permissions everything is correct. WTF? I have to say I&#x27;m confused by this one. I would imagine opening the folder on the file system on the server would be the sure fire way to get in, but remotely accessing it resolves the issue?
 Can anyone explain what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>Hi all, I believe I won&#x27;t be the first one to face this issue but I could not find any answers on the internet. 
 In our company we own about 12 domains, for those domains we have about 20+ SSL certificates (top level, subdomains, wildcard, etc) that are used for services like customer-facing websites, internal ERP systems, teamsconnector, load-balancers in cloud services etc. 
 Those cerficates all expire in different months and it is so hard to keep track of the expiry date, make sure they are renewed, and most importantly-- make sure that the new certificate are sent to the vendor and they update the certificate in time. 
 We have a few occassions when the renewal is missed by internal IT stuff, or the renewed certificate is sent to the vendor but they sit on it until the website goes down.
 Is there any suggestions for how to manage that?

                              <span>I am playing catch-up from the last admin. Freshly documenting everything to a spreadsheet for me. It is not for C-Suite, VPs or Directors to review. I am constantly being asked to send spreadsheets I&#x27;ve made for me, to a VP that should&#x27;ve documented theirselves if they needed the information.
 As per usual at the time, I used to send VP my spreadsheet because &quot;they said to&quot;, then they would subject me to all sorts of suggestions and changes and additions that would make the data kindergarten level understandable(colors, bold, &#x27;move this column here&#x27;, &#x27;add this column for that data&#x27;...etc), to them, but unnecessary if you actually read the information. I already have the bolds, underlines and colors necessary...FOR ME. I have now stopped (stopped sending my documentation, it is on our NAS, only I can edit it. They can read it) since realizing that not sending that data bears no consequences. It&#x27;s a small enough company that anyone in our IT realm could&#x27;ve done this and can do this. This VP also makes it a habit of taking other individuals&#x27; ideas and passing them as their own publicly.
 Has anyone else had an issue where once a VP/Dir knows that you have information useful to them(that they never thought would be before they knew you had it), they commandeer the format of your notes so that it suddenly becomes an involuntary collaborative effort?

There are fiber to Ethernet converters everywhere. The cabling in some of the buildings is thrown together, he had a main connection running through an old t1 punchdown block. It&#x27;s kind of fun figuring and straightening all this out though.

                              <span>Preface - I own a tech shop but we&#x27;re on the hardware side of things.
 I&#x27;m trying to set a client up with Tailscale and RDP so he can securely connect to his office machine and operate quickbooks and all his other software(CPA) through remote desktop. I&#x27;ve got Tailscale set up and working correctly. The problem I&#x27;m running into is authenticating the RDP session. If I open RDC on the client computer and enter the computer name of the host, it brings up an authentication dialogue. He&#x27;s using a 365 account so it&#x27;s already populated, and simply asks for the password. I know I&#x27;m entering it correctly and I&#x27;ve tried multiple times but it&#x27;s reporting the password incorrect. 
 So his MS account is &#x27;firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27;. RDC shows the login as a Microsoft Account &#x27;/firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27; so I&#x27;m just not seeing the problem here. We have good connectivity obviously as I mis-entered the computer name a couple times and it reported not finding any computers with that name on the network. I&#x27;m already home from my service call to his office but I told him I&#x27;d get to the bottom of it and remote in to make whichever changes deemed necessary by the powers that be - r/sysadmin
 send help.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I made a script to validate MFA on users accounts in Azure AD using the Graph API. It checks if the account is registered with the Microsoft Authenticator app or any 3rd party authenticator app. If the account hasn&#x27;t enabled MFA it will flag them with a date using custom security attributes, and in 7 days if they haven&#x27;t registered MFA it will disable their account. 
 ​
 Just to note I have this disabling the users on-premises account since we&#x27;re assuming they&#x27;re synced users from AD. You can always adjust the script to meet your needs as I have a function in there to disable the users Azure AD account but you will need to stop syncing the accountEnabled attribute in AAD Connect.

                              <span>I know this is an absurd question, but specifically to the sysadmins that are one running the whole show - is it common or did you ever encountered users that engaged in flirting to get you to put them in your priority/preference list? Is this something that happens? At times I felt this happened to me but it confused me greatly if this is common?
 Sorry for the dumb question I just want to know if some users do that, especially the attractive ones that might be used to getting things that way.

                              <span>Hi, this is my first post here, but I&#x27;ve been a lurker for a few months now.
 I work for a very small company. We have 5 employees, including the owner. I work remotely and the rest work in the office. We have a guy who got our Windows server setup about 2 years ago, along with the networking infrastructure in the office. The server is used to store our working files, and to allow us to access it remotely through a program called Centrestack. We have multiple backups going, one of which we take off-site. And we use Avast Business for our antivirus on the server and each employee&#x27;s laptop or desktop.
 I have been the default on-site &quot;IT&quot; guy since we moved into the office. I handle setting up new computers (we had around 13 employees last year, so I had more work to handle), creating new us…</span>

 I&#x27;m a part-time college professor in addition to my regular role as an IT manager, and want to survey all of you to check how many enterprises in 2023 are using desktops vs laptops for employees. We have a computer hardware course, and a disagreement between a few of us professors on what the current trend is for deployed hardware to ensure our course is relevant and up to date, as this course objective is to ensure students are prepared to be technicians in the working world, likely supporting organizations and enterprises.
 My experience has been majority of enterprises and work environments nowadays are laptop based, and rarely desktop based. 
 Can I ask for your feedback on what hardware approach you have in your environments? It seems I can&#x27;t do a poll type post to get a vote, so would appreciate your thoughts as comments below.
 If you do use desktops, what kind / size / form factor? Larger towers, mini towers, SFF, Micro, etc?
 EDIT - Thank you everyone for the replies so far, I&#x27;ll endeavour to individually comment and thank each of you by replying to your comments as I have time :) It&#x27;s very much appreciated to ensure we educate our students to join the industry in the future and be well equipped with knowledge by the time they graduate

 Microsoft has decided that all these attachments are &quot;high confidence phishing&quot; and it will not let them through. We need an admin to go through them and release them. No way to bypass this filtering, no way to let users release these messages, not even a good way to see what has been released and what hasn&#x27;t (if the email is sent to a distribution and you release to one user it will show as released, even though most users didn&#x27;t get it).

Anyways, I got an email when I sign up for a domain name through the company Hover. I&#x27;ve had a few issues with this company, including very slow emails sinking, and troubles with linking it to my Gmail account, but something that I find it very weird and doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is why a lot of times when I try to sign up for some thing using my email address it says that my email is invalid. For example if I go to a grocery store and try to sign up for their rewards card or something, usually it says that my email is not valid and they asked me if I spelled it right, etc. When this happens I often feel defensive like &quot;listen pal, I pay for this email address and it&#x27;s definitely legit - do you want me to prove it to you? what&#x27;s your email address? I&#x27;ll email you right now!&quot; lol. Only half joking. But seriously, why is this happening, and is there a way to fix it? I did use my email name to be [info@myname.com](mailto:info@myname.com) - so perhaps some people think it&#x27;s a fake name, and like a chump like me couldn&#x27;t possibly have such a personalized email, but is it a problem with Hover? Or is it a problem with my email settings? Or is it that the &quot;info@&quot; emails are somehow blacklisted as not personal emails, or are considered like &quot;no reply&quot; emails?

                              <span>Feel stupid asking this question but having a hard time wrapping my head around this. We had a provider wan link outage yesterday. During the outage I could not get to any internal IP based devices, ie, switches, firewall, servers, etc. I use internal dns servers on my desktop/laptop. Gateway is a layer 3 switch. I cannot via browser access the switch address which is just an ip, not any specific internal ip only devices that do not have dns names.
 I was able to ping, unc paths work. By the time I was getting ready to try ssh, etc. the wan link came back up and everything started working. This had happened one other time and at the time I didn&#x27;t think a lot of it because it was real short. I do know this was a wan link issue and not a core issue.
 I did look into my browswer setting and automatic proxy was on. Would this cause the issue? Would this still be dns (as everything is dns)? I can do some testing early mornings before office gets going to figure this out but things just don&#x27;t seem to make sense.
 Appreciate any thoughts, ideas.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with getting rid of all the Out of Support .NET Core versions in our environment at work (5.0 and earlier, since only 6.0 is currently in support). I&#x27;ve tried using the Uninstall Tool, which removed a few loose versions but honestly not much that it can see. I also tried modifying the Visual Studio 2019 Installer to uncheck the Out of Support individual component boxes, but that only removed the most recent version of each version (ex. removed 5.0.17 but not 5.0.14).
 I&#x27;m at a loss of what else to do other than figure out scripting or manual removal of all the loose folders that still remain on the 300+ machines that Qualys reports with vulnerable .NET Core versions. Any ideas?

 I need to find a cost effective vendor for replacement laptops for my guys out in the field. Our need isn&#x27;t enough to buy in bulk; more ad hoc purchase as my field user&#x27;s beat their laptops into oblivion.
 For context, I work in construction management.
 Thanks!

The site is not blocked through our firewall, and not blocked through malwarebytes. It was working a few days ago. There has been some spam email that has been cycling through our network from that website. but Any block request go through me. We arent running VPN or Proxy. and i dont think office365 would be blocking any domains. ive tried two different browsers. any one have any suggestions?
 ​
 thanks

                              <span>Hello, this is somewhat of a follow up post of my rant about a demanding user. 
 This time, It is their inbox. It is constantly filling up. We get 2-3 tickets a week from this user about her damn emails (always with that annoying red !). For information, this user works in accounting, They seem to treat their inbox as the archives for entire department. (Filled up a 50gb archive in 3 months) No one else in accounting has this issue!
 How are you folks dealing with situations like this? it seems like everywhere that I&#x27;ve worked, there is someone in accounting who clutches on to all emails like a golden egg.I am getting extremely frustrated with having to deal with this 1 persons email every other day, looking for any guidance on how to deal with this, should I ask her boss why she needs to keep all these emails? I am not aware of any compliance requirements.

 Aside from storing the individual bitlocker keys in a secure location, is there anything I should be concerned about when implementing it or it is generally smooth sailing? Is system performance generally impacted? Some of our systems are 5+ years old. Is it possible to brick systems with bitlocker?
 Also, are there automated ways to enable BitLocker that you would recommend?

                              <span>Anyone ever run into the challenge of wanting to set up a device for ldap auth and the product has a character limit for the bind DN?
 This conflicts with our well organized AD structure which has such accounts in a particular OU, ending up having to move it to a non-standard spot, which causes severe gear grinding.
 We are running into this with our Tripplite PDUs. First time I&#x27;ve ever run into something so boneheaded.
 Am I overlooking some obvious workaround for this or do I just have to swallow my OCD on this one and live with the account in an odd spot - which for us would be the very tippy-top of our domain.
 thx!

                              <span>Is there a way in GPO to set how much space system restore points can use on the C drive? I ask because we are running AVD and noticed a bunch of C drives with low space. 
 I noticed all the space is being used in System Volume Information. When I went and set the slider to only use 50% of the drive for points it released the space back.
 I can actually stop using restore points all together if thats an option also. These machines are dispensable if that makes sense.

 Do I need to have a permanent location for this certificate on a server, or does it literally import the certificate into the GPO and then I can delete the certificate?

                              <span>Hello!
 I have 5 printers, 150 users (not all of them print, probably 20 active users).
 I&#x27;m looking for a cloud printing solution. So far I&#x27;ve looked into Printix, ezeep, PaperCut Hive - those solutions would cost me 3500$ or more per year - way too much for me.
 Can you recommend cheaper alternatives? I want to be able to deploy them easily, have some sort of control who can print. In the past I tried PaperCut Mobility Print but I couldn&#x27;t find a way to control who can print.
 Thank you in advance

                              <span>When using the NPS assistent for 802.1x you are prompted to create or select a Radius client (i.e. a switch or wireless access point) and then select create the restrictions/permissions that should be associated with this device.
 After finishing the assistent, several rules are created. None of them specify the device that they are applied to, just the port type (wired or wireless).
 Questions:
 How can i determine, which rule is applied to which device?
 How do i apply access rules for wired or wireless connections to multiple devices?
 ​
 Any hints are appreciated.

                              <span>Looking for some advice from veteran system admins. 
 I’m young under 26 years old, and a system admin.
 I eventually want to get into cloud security (I know broad but not sure exactly what yet). My current role covers a lot from level 1 tickets to more difficult projects/troubleshooting systems, and pay is not the best (low balled myself because I wanted the job) but love that I got this position so early in life.
 So wanted to know was it worth it for yourself to make work and getting certifications your whole life this early? Staying late in the office (long commute), studying after work and weekends for certs, online classes.
 Was the position/high salary worth it later on in life to give up traveling, experiencing life at a young age?

 I have a SCCM server running on ms server 2012R2 Datacenter, who gives a very strange error.
 When i create a file or dir it goes oke, if i am on the server and try to change this file or dir on driveletter level then i can do than with no problem. BUT when i try to change the file or dir via an UNC path then i get an invalid MS-DOS function.
 I scouted the internet for this problem but did not get any working solutions. did chkdisk, regedit and hotfix/update to latest patch level, with no solution.
 Who has an bright idea or solved a simular problem.

                              <span>The initial version of our service consisted of distributed components that were orchestrated by AWS Step Functions. The two most expensive operations in terms of cost were the orchestration workflow and when data passed between distributed components. To address this, we moved all components into a single process to keep the data transfer within the process memory, which also simplified the orchestration logic.

 Note that this is only regarding one tool and that it&#x27;s still running as a cloud service. But it&#x27;s quite an interesting read.

                              <span>So im making some GPO changes to block users from creating or adding data to their pst files.
 Made these changes on gpo editor using the administrative templates
 Policy:
 Prevent users from adding new content to existing PST files - enabled
 Prevent users from adding PSTs to outlook profiles and/or prevent user sharing exclusive PSTs - enabled and no PST can be added
 Auto archive settings - disabled
 Disable file|archive - enabled 
 The registry keys get created with the proper value of 1 ( acording to MS ) but when i go into outlook i can still create new PST and add data/mails to existing PST 
 been breaking my head for almost a week already and i cant find whats missing , again the policy gets applied &gt; creates the registry keys with proper value but then dosent work

 We have an old Windows XP machine for wood working.
 The XP machine is not in domain. Until now a shared folder was mapped from Windows 10 computer (smb1.0 is enabled).
 Now we can&#x27;t reach the share, always prompt for the password but the user is not locking out from AD after 3 bad password.
 I can ping the domain controller from the Windows XP machine, everything looks fine.
 I tried to restart the machines the firewall on windows 10 machine is turned off.
 You have any idea what can I test?
 Update1 : I created an XP VM and from that VM I can reach the share. So the Windows 10 machine is good.

                              <span>Our Office 365 tenant just started having issues receiving emails for companies like ZIX, RiverApp, and SignNow just to name a few. The message is hitting Exchange Online, failing to be delivered to the recipient, and sending a NDR to the sender. The Error is as follows.
 Error: ‎550 5.7.162 OmeEncryptionAgent; Permanent Failure 550-5.7.162 Exception encountered: RmException. 550-5.7.162 Exception message: ETR encryption only applies to outgoing mail.

 A non-delivery report (NDR) message was sent to ‎noreply@signnow.com‎. The NDR might provide more details about why the email message wasn&#x27;t delivered and how to fix the issue. 
 We have the proper licensing to use OME and haven&#x27;t had any issues until Monday. The only thing that was done was an ALIAS domain was added for Exchange Online. I am able to send Sensitive Emails just fine.
 I contacted our reseller and they stated the those companies don&#x27;t have the required license and feature enabled to send a sensitive emails and there is nothing wrong on our end.
 Anyone have any ideas?

 I can&#x27;t see any way to change that, but I might be missing something, does anyone here know either how to change the owner of the review or make the emails stop going to me, but still go to the reviewers?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some insight from those who manage platforms either via UEM or multiple MDMs. We currently have Intune in place for Windows and looking to move to Samsung Knox for Android devices (Samsung only) as Intune didn&#x27;t have enough functionality and was infuriating to manage and push updates from.
 We&#x27;re now presented with a few iOS and Mac devices that need to be added to our network and managed under MDM. I&#x27;m toying with the idea of having a third solution for Apple devices so each one is fit for purpose but have had counter arguments that it&#x27;s best to keep things under a single pane of glass for ease of management.
 What are the pro&#x27;s and cons of both in your eyes? We don&#x27;t have much onsite resource so looking to avoid technical limitations and &quot;quirks&quot; where possible, but then also not add too many solutions into the mix for this reason.

 Cannot for the life of me figure out why. Even read articles from Microsoft. Maybe I’m missing the obvious. 
 Anyone else experiencing this?

                              <span>Microsoft announced today that Windows admins can now choose to be emailed when new known issues are added to the Windows release health section of the Microsoft 365 admin center.
 After enrolling, IT admins will receive an email every time known issues are added or updated with new information, including changes in status, new workarounds, or issue resolutions.
 As Redmond explained, it is only available for those with admin roles in organizations with eligible Windows or Microsoft 365 for Business subscriptions that provide access to Windows release health in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
 “First, log in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and locate Windows release health under the Health menu,” said Microsoft senior program manager Mabel Gomes.

                              <span>Hi all. Work for a development company - we currently have devs supply us with their personal github account, and we provide them with the appropriate level of access for their role.
 I dislike this as we have no control over the account itself, and many people do not have a display or first/last name, meaning that in a situation where we need to offboard someone quickly we will be faced with trying to decipher what their account is called, and its always some nickname or &#x27;cooldevguy-23&#x27;, so theres a chance we miss them or disable the wrong account 
 ​
 How do you handle your github? Has anyone had this situation? At a previous company I was at we just created new accounts from the beginning...

                              <span>Guys,
 we need to be able to stop a yubikey from showing up in a VDA but the devices tab is missing from the VDA. I hear theres a setting in CitrixGroupPolicyManagement_x64.msi, but the DL is locked behind a company account which we do not have, nor to I think we&#x27;d need one.
 I tried working with registry keys but no cigar. The VDA usage interacts with our yubikey SC and locks it&#x27;s PIN shortly after. Tried reinstalling citrix workspace as admin but no devices tab shows up in the VDA.
 Can someone provide CitrixGroupPolicyManagement_x64.msi?
 This is like...really annoying :D

                              <span>&quot;Hey, is anyone using a SaaS-based password manager hosted in Australia with integration for Azure and SAML-based SSO? It must be hosted in Australia. 
 Please let me know if you have any recommendations. Thanks!&quot;

 ​
 I&#x27;ve been messing with ADFS since company has decided to audit the ADFS login using a 3rd party software. In order for the 3rd party software to audit can capture the details of the user logging in correctly, it requires that all relying parties be added with 6 new claim rules.
 Any idea how I can achieve this?

                              <span>Hello. I am currently in the midst of making a cheaper environment for out company in azure, but using cheaper resource tiers comes with limitation. One of them being that a basic tier VPN GW can only use Certs for P2S and its SSTP.
 So therefor we are going to be using certs. the vpn gw has a self signed root cert. and all clients need a client cert signed by the root.
 we want to be able to deploy individual certs to each employee to allow for evoking access to individual users.
 Manually making client certs for each employee is not feasible. so i want to deploy a script via intune that makes this cert for each employee.
 now here comes the problems, i need to sign these certs with a remote root. but i cant for the life of me find out how. we have the root in a key vault. but every article talking about using csr is for for signing something to the kv. 
 how do i sign with a remote root cert from the client device via a powershell script.

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I help out and have started digitising a local charity, part of this is to give them Office 365. My plan was to create a Microsoft Form so internal users could create more users inputting all the details, including selecting groups from a drop down... Sadly time has not been on my side and it&#x27;s been a few months, and I&#x27;ve still not got around to testing/getting something working.
 ​
 Does anyone have a template form and automate that they wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing to help me/charity out before i put this out to the r/slavelabour sub.
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>By default SharePoint is set to retain 500 major versions of a document. PPT docs in my environment can easily be several hundred megs each and staff are hammering these docs daily creating lots of versions as they save. A single file can be taking up 200 gig of versions and I&#x27;ve got quite a few of these files which is swamping my 1TB quota. It&#x27;s a pretty small and lean business too so they can&#x27;t afford the extorsionate prices for extra SharePoint storage. Meanwhile, we&#x27;ve got groups of people collaborating on reports that they write which legitimately require lots of versions but aren&#x27;t anywhere near the same file size. How do I manage this runaway storage consumption? Is there a way to set SharePoint to keep no more than X megabytes of versions per file at which point it purges old versions?

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 For those who work y NetOps daily operations, how do you handle the high number of alerts received by email?
 I personally have the rule to move them to a separate folder and just look them up in case of an issue arises. The &quot;critical alerts&quot; are not in that rule, they rarely are triggered.

I need to find a price point of an Ekinops ONE2501. I have emailed the company but have yet to hear back anything so just wondering if anyone can shed some light on even just a general idea of a price point. Any input is greatly appreciated! Thank you

 I recently had reached out to Colby via the site&#x27;s &quot;contact&quot; form and via an email I found on his YT account (last video in 2020). I waited a week and no response to my inquiry, so I just went ahead and purchased the eBook.
 Well, the automated email services that send the .ascm file out aren&#x27;t working. Neither are the discount codes for the stencils. Tried reaching out to Colby on LinkedIn - no response and hasn&#x27;t been active in over 2 months. He hasn&#x27;t been active on Facebook since 2015 and Twitter since 2018.
 Currently waiting on PayPal&#x27;s bullshit claim process to get my $50 back.

 I&#x27;m interviewing for a new job next week - managing enterprise deployments using Cisco Meraki and VeloCloud SD-WAN. All my previous networking experience has been in a Juniper and Aruba environment - but I really want this job! Since I have about a week to study, what advice would you have or resources would you recommend for getting an up to speed on Meraki and VeloCloud SD-Wan? I know I could pick the skills up quickly on the job, but I want to show some understanding and knowledge in the interview.

 ​
 Can I use 10GBASE-T ports for stacking on the 1960 12XGT JL805A switch. My goal is to have more SFP+ ports for uplinking the servers.
 ​
 Another question, is it good to be used as CORE for a network with about 10 Switch 1960 below it?

                              <span>Does anybody know of any well-known network equipment vendors who actually embrace 3rd party optics?
 We all know the typical vendor spiel about how &quot;3rd party optics are not supported&quot;, and some of them go so far as to disallow their use altogether (by disabling ports, etc).
 Are any actually OK with these optics? Maybe not to the point of supporting or troubleshooting them when they&#x27;re a problem, but at least making an effort to integrate?
 It seems like there is opportunity in the industry for vendors to differentiate themselves by treating optics the way many server manufacturers treat hard drives (or at least used to).

                              <span>Mostly I&#x27;m curious about the enterprise state of the industry with respect to SFP56 for Ethernet (less so for infiniband).
 I know there are &quot;25GbE&quot; cards with single SFP28 ports on them (like the Mellanox ConnectX-4&#x27;s), but I&#x27;ve not seen any &quot;50GbE&quot; cards with a single-channel SFP56 port. I&#x27;m asking about PCIe cards, but if there are N-port SFP56 cards for switches and routers, then that would be interesting to know.
 So do single-channel SFP56 cards/switch ports exist, or is SFP56 too new at this point for that to be rolled out?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Please excuse the post if this is in the wrong subreddit. I am looking to see if a proposed network design is possible.
 We currently have a network that is double-nat&#x27;d as that is what the customer is providing us. Our network is communicating via cellular to a separate building to view all required devices. We are looking to bring all devices over to one network, however, there seems to be stability issues and due to the nature of the customer, want to keep the networks separated.
 The caveat is that both networks are programmed with the same subnet, so adding a third router will not work. (I know I know)
 As a temporary solution (Again I know), I want to propose the design below to see if it is feasible. It would effectively require the addition of two new routers to a tripple nat&#x27;d design. The requirement is that router 1 be able to talk to the devices behind router 2. My though was via port forwarding.
 Feel free to downvote if I am being dumb in my thought process or let me know if this is not possible.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just wondering, first, does Cisco still offer CLCs with larger orders of new equipment?
 Specifically, I work in K12 and we buy everything via E-Rate and our equipment ships with the EDU suffix.
 I&#x27;m trying to see about getting some CLCs with an order we&#x27;re about to place for 30 or so new switches. My rep is saying since this is E-Rate and EDU purchases, CLCs would be considered a &quot;gift&quot; which would present a problem and she is very hesitant on doing this for us.
 Is this bullshit? Is there anyone in K12 that managed to get CLCs under these circumstances?
 I do know a previous employee was successfully able to get CLCs with EDU orders. I&#x27;m wondering if I should try to escalate this issue or fight it.
 I&#x27;m also not sure what the &quot;problem&quot; of a gift would be in my situation. This is my first gig in K12 so I&#x27;m not sure how this is supposed to work in these environments.

                              <span>We currently have an expensive fiber loop linking our 3 campuses (10gig links between sites, 2gb internet) and we&#x27;re exploring more affordable options. We&#x27;re hardly using the links right now, on a heavy day the internet interface gets 1-2% usage at peak and the loop even less than that. we&#x27;re an msp that services about 2-2500 people. 
 obviously visiting msp/isp sites will tell you they&#x27;re the best. i assume leasing fiber somewhere else will be just as expensive. before we went this route we used switched ethernet. it was a 1gb link all around and it was adequate and no fiber leasing involved. beyond that i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s a good (us) solution. Anyone gone through a similar scenario lately and have some advice to share?

                              <span>Basically the best practice in our &quot;world&quot; has been devote 3 AZ&#x27;s where A and B are HA and stood up with a hot ready C in case A or B get devastated. 
 The problem now is I&#x27;m incorporating GWLB&#x27;s and TGW into our set up and I haven&#x27;t fully tested if a &quot;hot standby&quot; endpoint would work in C for the GWLB.
 I&#x27;m at the moment, kinda opposed to having a C because I haven&#x27;t heard of an entire AZ outage, but obviously need the data to support and trump my &quot;anecdotal&quot; experience.
 Anyone have some solid data?

 I would like to know the best solution to monitor configuration changes on Cisco equipment. We have a networking team with multiple network admins and all of them make changes to the network throughout the day. I would like to find a monitoring tool that isn’t too resource intensive to know what changes are being made to our equipment. Any suggestions on what tools would help? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m designing the network for a new production plant. I have a doubt how protect the servers network. Would be enough to segredate the servers in a dedicated VLAN routed on the core switch and configure in each server Windows firewall instead of route all the traffic in/out in the hardware firewall used also as perimter firewall?
 Could have sense put the firewall hardware on the top of the windows firewall?
 Should I monitoring with snort the traffic throught the server network?
 The company have normal network usage, internet, file share and applications based on SQL server. The invironment is fully virtualized on VmWare Esx.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi all. This is probably bordering on a rule 6 violation for you guys but I really have researched the hell out of this one and I&#x27;m getting conflicting info.
 I&#x27;ve been leased ipv4 subnets with a LOA. I want to lease these subnets to another party. I want to prevent the other party from discovering the source of my lease and cutting me out (yes, I am I middleman). The other party knows how to do an ARIN whois. Is this possible?
 If I announce these subnets on my provider&#x27;s ASN would that be enough?

The leaf switches are in vpc but ports connecting to esxi hosts are orphan ports(compute team says something like lacp cannot be configured as per accepted design with customer). We are doing some kind of validation testing for new DC being build, the issue is when we shut down leaf SW1 the esxi hosts are reachable but when the leaf SW1 comes back again, the esxi hosts goes unreachable for about 90-120 secs. Then hosts becomes reachable. Not sure why. Does anyone aware of this issue and know why this is happening?

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I&#x27;m an apprentice network technician and I have to help improve the infrastructure of the organization where I work, which is mainly composed of Aruba CX Switch and HP ProCurve. I had the thought to use Spanning Tree, and I made a lot of tests on network simulation software like EVE-NG , but I don&#x27;t have a lot of knowledge about this protocol , and despite having consulted guides , articles , and ChatGPT , I still have some questions with no answers : 
 ​
 - It is possible to deploy STP on a mesh topology , or a topology where nodes are connected to each others with numerous links ? ( I&#x27;m asking this because i want to make STP work on a model with 4 switches, where each switch have a direct link with the others 3 ).
 - How much control do we have in the creation in the logical path made by STP ? ( I would like to know the main ways to designate a port as &quot;designated&quot;, &quot;root&quot; or &quot;alternate&quot; role ) 
 - is it a good idea to use &quot;loop-protect&quot; command in addition of STP commands ? 
 ​
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m clear enough , but if you have any tip to propose , I will be very grateful.

                              <span>When configuring a VPN gateway what is the functional difference between a split tunnel vs only including specific routes? Is it as simple as with a split tunnel DNS makes the decisions about routing? I&#x27;m trying to understand the limitations of PaloAlto&#x27;s include GP licences which does not allow split tunnel but you can limit which routes the client direct toward the VPN. I am willing to admit that I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of these concepts if so please feel free to point that out and nudge me in the right direction.

                              <span>Hey there, 
 I&#x27;ve got a few networks which I&#x27;m planning to mirror to a different location.
 I got about 6 Hubs which are currently connected to one Spoke. 
 Each Hub does have 2 active links which are connected to Spoke via Layer2. On top ECMP and OSPF
 Now I rented a bit of space in a nearby DC. 
 ​
 DR is a Fortigate and all Hubs are connected also on a clustered Fortigate.
 ​
 I&#x27;d like to get a Link between HQ A and DC. I only get a single VLAN ID, so Transparent Layer2 wont be possible. So I need Layer3.
 ​
 Now I need to set an alternative Route to those now resisiding in HQ A to create some sort of Disaster Recovery Zone
 Can somebody point me in the right direction?

 Is there anywhere that I can find a side-by-side report showing reliability etc?
 Thanks for any help?

                              <span>I’ve asked for IPSLA (RTT) to be enabled on the WAN links so that I can collect the data in with snmp. Senior tech (CCIE) says that IPSLA is only to be used in an incident / troubleshooting situation and not to be running all the time. 
 Is this right?
 I don’t know how else to build historical information as to our wan performance. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey, I recently got a new laptop for school and I noticed that while it does connect to the internet, I am getting weird errors. It usually is something like &quot;This website uses HSTS, We cannot connect...&quot; for many websites, not all. Some of them give me &quot;security errors&quot; I also straight up cannot connect to some websites too. I asked my admin, who simply said to use school administered laptops, which isnt an option for my film production class as chromebooks are ass for editing videos, as you might guess...
 My networking knowledge is very limited, so let me know what it could be or what steps I could take to more closely diagnose the issue, because right now im unsure what the problem is to research.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working in Cisco TAC for some time now, and also have been lurking here for around a similar time frame. Honestly, even though I work many late nights trying to solve things on my own, I love my job. I am constantly learning and trying to put my best into every case. When I don&#x27;t know something, I ask my colleagues, read the RFC or just throw it in the lab myself and test it. I screw up sometimes and drop the ball, but so does anybody else on a bad day.
 I just want to genuinely understand why some people in this sub dislike or outright hate Cisco/Cisco TAC. Maybe it&#x27;s just me being young, but I want to make a difference and better myself and my team. Even in my own tech, there are things I don&#x27;t like that I and others are trying to improve. How can a Cisco TAC engineer (or any TAC engineer for that matter) make a difference for you guys and give you a better experience?

 I’ve been checking out the new outlook edge dev, outlook , teams and teamviewer and I have to say…what in the fuck? The new outlook appears to be the web client of outlook and other sorts of general fuckery. Not enjoying it at all, teams not so bad but they have stripped out some settings it seems.
 Am I the old guy over the fence? Surely I can’t be

                              <span>The other engineer quit at my company, we are still on the upswing of a major Dr incident. Me and my boss had an abrasive conversation today about hours expectation with only me left on the systems side until the other guy is replaced and he said we should regroup tomorrow and discuss further. I was professional, he acted taken aback sand said the expectation was always that we are working 50-55 hours on average (I asked specifically in my interview and was told 40-45) he also said that he has never had an engineer push bsck before. . I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m at any risk of being fired, and if i pushed back really hard they&#x27;d pretty much have to go with it within reason at this point. 
 I&#x27;ve seen some people reference court cases where engineers/admins have gone back and got paid out for overtime because they aren&#x27;t in a &quot;creative&quot; or &quot;manager&quot; role. I&#x27;m not looking to necessarily sue my employer at this point, just go hourly. I&#x27;m sick of working extra for free and want to be able to back my case for going hourly at least for now.
 Side note, I&#x27;m actively looking for other jobs and don&#x27;t intent to be hear another year let alone 3 months.

Something simple to even give to a Lead/Manager or helpdesk person to keep an eye on from time to time... any suggestions? I&#x27;ve tried cockpit.. but that is one machine at a time. Looking at CheckMK, not sure it has a great dashboard for something like that.... other ideas that are open source/free?

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin - I&#x27;m trying to propose a new strategy for our laptop lifecycle in a 99% Mac shop. I know the common/standard advice is 3-4 years, but I&#x27;ve also seen articles/experiments that suggest even 2 years is a significant upgrade to productivity. However, I don&#x27;t know if that makes a lot of sense with a Mac shop - they tend to age fairly well, and unless a major hardware update comes along (like the switch from Intel to ARM processors) I&#x27;m having a hard time justifying the cost of replacing a fully functional 2020-2021 M1 laptop.
 What are your thoughts on this? Are there reports on productivity metrics for a certain cadence of Mac replacements specifically? The only ones I&#x27;ve seen seem to be centered on Windows.

                              <span>Hey, I need some help. 
 At my company, the Legal team asked us to NOT format computers, so we can´t re-assign computers from people that left the company. We dont know how long it will be this way, so I was looking for a solution. 
 Do you know of any tool that could save an image of the computer (both windows and mac) in a way that would still be valid for an external auditor / court? 
 Have you dealt with something like this before? 
 Any input is welcome!

                              <span>Hey /r/sysadmin, I&#x27;m a security engineer/administrator and I find myself taking a lot of screenshots for evidence and creating instruction guides and etc.
 Don&#x27;t laugh, but my current workflow is to use Snipping Tool, then open the image in MS Paint, then mark it up. There&#x27;s got to be an easier way to do this, as it&#x27;s tedious and MS Paint&#x27;s markup sucks.
 What FOSS does this group like to quickly take screenshots, crop, outline, draw arrows, provide steps, and edit images in other ways?

Are there any recent Windows Update issues or &quot;kabooms&quot; that might cause this result? Our NPS server is currently Windows Server 2012 R2.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Rebooting the server
 Requesting a new certificate and applying this to all the Policies in NPS (the existing certificate was externally trusted and still valid, but it was suggested I should try a new one anyway)
 Checking TLS settings are still set correctly (TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2)
 Performed a packet capture between one of our APs and the NPS server

 ​
 Hoping you can help. I have a laptop that i need to be able to access an access database. The access database is in our office and the laptop will be going home with a director. This is the first time WFH has come up as its a fabrication plant. 
 What&#x27;s the easiest/most reliable way to do this do you think? We can spend some money if needs be but it&#x27;s an infrequent ask so I dont want a huge spend profile. 
 The access DB is on a NAS so I could enable remote access but the users IT skills are low so I don&#x27;t want a complex solution. They could probably get a RDP session but that feels clunky especially on a 14&quot; laptop 
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>We are primary a U.S. based company however sometimes end users will travel outside the USA for vacation or to meet with clients. Currnetlly out CA polocy only allows access from USA. However somtimes we will open up a whole country for example Mexico for one person to have access. Is there anyway to limit it to just the user? So were not allowing anything from mexico to login just the end user.

                              <span>This is something that may have been covered already if so, I apologize.
 My company has roughly 400 employees and 3 IT staff and I&#x27;m the only one who works on any of the O365 management, and I&#x27;m looking for some advice here. We recently went with KnowBe4 for security training, and we are utilizing the phish alert button. Currently it&#x27;s setup to send an email to our team with an attachment of the email (I think this is the default) but with how many employees we have vs how many people are monitoring and managing it the folder I have them going to is filling up rather fast.
 Does anyone else using this service have any tips or tricks to possibly automating this to grab the header information of the emails using PowerShell or even power automate? This is my first admin job so I am kind of a beginner to power automate and the exchange module in PowerShell. I currently have 250+ emails that are reported as phishing and it seems counter productive to open each one then go into the properties and scroll through the header info to find the domain or IP and block it in exchange. I also know I would need to proof some of them as some people report emails that their bosses send to them lol. 
 I do know in KnowBe4 there is an option if using the add-in via exchange to add header info to the email when reported but that isn&#x27;t working for me for some reason, I also would prefer to learn more on the automation side if possible.
 I know they also have a package you can purchase that would help with this via KnowBe4 but just getting KnowBe4&#x27;s service for a security audit was a nightmare due to an &quot;IT Budget&quot; not existing. 
 ​
 TLDR: Looking for recommendations or pointers in the right direction to automate the KnowBe4 Phish Alert Button to grab the header information from emails that are reported by users and sent to me to help efficiently block them in exchange.

                              <span>How do you add a TXT record of the same name for a description of what the CNAME record is for? The actual goal will be for CNAME DKIM records if that matters.
 For example: 
  
CNAME testdata.domain.tld ...
 TXT testdata.domain.tld &quot;This is used for XYZ&quot;
 When I go to enter the TXT record, our DNS host states &quot;testdata.domain.tld has CNAME and Non-CNAME types&quot; and doesn&#x27;t add the TXT record
  
Wondering what others do for TXT descriptors to keep track of what a DNS entry is for (if the entry doesn&#x27;t make visual sense)

 My work acquired a new company and goal is to delete/re-create Outlook profile. When users opens Outlook, they can enter their new company email address. 
 I plan on creating a GPO once this batch file works. 
 I tried the following and works once but not second or third time. Should this work?
 Thank you in advance
 taskkill /IM outlook.exe /f taskkill /IM OneDrive.exe /f reg.exe delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles /f reg.exe add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles\NewMail

                              <span>Hey guys 
 What is the best practise for a fileserver in a failover cluster with the data disk (the disks where all the user data is on with the cifs shares)?
 -ClusterSharedVolume? 
 -iSCSI mapped into the fileserver vm?
 Another possibility could be a vhdx in the SAN cluster shared volume, but I would like to use the deduplication feature from the SAN. 
 Thank you for your ideas.

                              <span>I was curious about people&#x27;s experiences with the Safe Attachment feature within Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It appears randomly people will report the attachment either takes extremely long or doesn&#x27;t end up finishing scanning. Now since my few years in IT, I feel like I would always hear this was a thing for Microsoft and this service. To me, it sounds like something out of my control (or anyone of us in this position). I speculate this can result from how the service is running and how many attachments are being filtered by Microsoft at that time. The only possible actions I can either attempt to change my safe attachment setting to send an email upon full scan (which doesn&#x27;t appear to be a thing anymore from what I&#x27;ve seen) or forward the original email yourself to have the email rescanned. I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has tips &amp; tricks on a scenario like this or if my suspicions are right.

                              <span>I was patching Apex One Server from 11564 to 12024 and it got stuck at &quot;Apply iAC server hotfix&quot;.
 Upon checking &quot;C:\TMPatch.log&quot; found that the installer runs a BAT file:

 So just for curiosity I ran the BAT and found it asks :
 Does C:\Program Files (x86)\Trend Micro\OfficeScan\PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\iServicePackage\iAC specify a file name
 or directory name on the target
 (F &#x3D; file, D &#x3D; directory)?

                              <span>Currently not using Apple Business Manager but I do have iOS devices in an MDM. Going to move things to Intune and drop the current MDM. One thing that the old MDM couldn&#x27;t do was automatically upgrade iOS devices. For the current MDM to do that it needed devices to be in the ABM. The current MDM can also control a lot of settings (CIS policy recommendations) but some settings required the devices to be in the ABM so those can&#x27;t be set by it. So to me, it looks like Apple only lets an MDM solution have access to whatever it decides to allow it to manage. Of course that could just be the MDM I&#x27;m using. Now with the move to Intune I&#x27;m being told by the consultant that it can push iOS updates without the ABM being used. Is this true? Also, does Intune have access to all of the iOS settings/controls without the ABM? I would like to be wrong here but I&#x27;d rather get in front of it now if the ABM is needed. Last thing I want is to find out later that I was right and using ABM is necessary to have full control over the apple devices.

                              <span>Most of the tech giants in these days are overwhelmed with the feeling of getting rich much faster. In order to do so, the influencers, who are just showcasing themselves as millionaires are getting into the market by imposing the bad influence about the 9-5 jobs. 
 To be frank, 9-5 jobs or whatever jobs that you are in currently is the right fit for you. You can invest in better assets later and gradually you can increase your income and grow based on the goals. If you are misguided by the concept of getting richer as the car that phases with the jet engine, then you are in a huge misconception. 
 Pursue your education, follow your goals and let your life see the light in its own way. Cheers!

                              <span>A while back, I wrote a DMARC parser in python, with a simple tkinter GUI to help visualize the data better.
 Typically, I allow a week&#x27;s worth of reports to accumulate before throwing them all in the parser and doing a brief analysis.
 This morning, while completing this process, I noticed 3 different reports from different senders were completely empty, except for the word &quot;unused&quot;. Other than that, they appeared to look like regular reports. (Gzipped XML files)
 I couldn&#x27;t find anything related to this when I skimmed the RFC. Does this happen with anyone else or should it be expected? This is the first time it happened after around a year&#x27;s worth of use. (it broke the parser since it didn&#x27;t look like valid XML)

 This host is mainly dedicated for 1 VM (Eclipse) but also has ZVM (Zerto) and vCLS running on it. I have 16 vCPUs / 8 cores per socket running on the Eclipse VM. Another 2 vCPUs / 1 core per socket are dedicated for ZVM and 1 vCPU / 1 core per socket for vCLS.
 We are having performance issues with our Eclipse VM (playing the finger pointing game with their support) and allocating more vCPUs to it has slightly resolved the issue. Am I able to allocate all 20 vCPUs / 10 cores per socket for that VM even though we have the 2 other VMs using up some of those vCPUs?

                              <span>Our HQ is the internet breakout for several satellite sites in multiple countries across Europe. Obviously some of our employees change Google&#x27;s IP address  country association from time to time to their country (we don&#x27;t know who exactly), resulting in wrong currency and language in some search results for the majority of users.
 Does anybody know a way to set the GeoIP location permanently, without non-authorized persons to change it?
 I found only a form to change the IP location that can be used by anybody. The only support contact mail I could find was local to our region and seems to be operated by chatbots :-(

 Your answer could apply to any of these questions: - “What are you working on?” - “What do you do in your job?” - “Why are you trying to escape this mind-numbing chat so quickly?” - “Why do you need to leave early from the meeting-that-should-have-been-an-email?”
 The only one I could think of was from Sim City: “Reticulating splines”.
 Keep it clean please.

                              <span>The latest gross web push from Microsoft sees businesses forced to use Edge for certain links.
 Microsoft Edge is a good browser but for some reason Microsoft keeps trying to shove it down everyone’s throat and make it more difficult to use rivals like Chrome or Firefox. Microsoft has now started notifying IT admins that it will force Outlook and Teams to ignore the default web browser on Windows and open links in Microsoft Edge instead.
 Reddit users have posted messages from the Microsoft 365 admin center that reveal how Microsoft is going to roll out this change. “Web links from Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts and Microsoft (MSA) accounts in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge in a single view showing the opened link side-by-side with the email it came from,” reads a message to IT admins from Microsoft.

                              <span>Hey, I hope it’s okay here to ask a question…I have to make a short presentation about MS Defender Vulnerability Management for my manager and I am quite new in this Field. I read nearly the whole documentation, but I think I am a bit lost atm.
 The main questions are:
 Q: What are the different states of vulnerabilities (open, closed,...) - I can&#x27;t exactly find open, closed and other statuses. Should it be about critical, high based on CVSS or how would you understand the Task ?
 Q: How does MSD mark vulnerabilities as closed? -
 Q:Integration with ServiceNow VR Application and how is a vulnerability item updated ?
 I would really appreciate if someone could give me a short explanation to each answer, so I don&#x27;t get lost since the topic is quite big for a newbie.
 Thanks in advance and have a great day!

                              <span>As we have more and more people working outside of the office we want to start looking towards AAD and Intune for our devices.
 ​
 We&#x27;d like to start by going Hybrid AAD but one thing I&#x27;m hoping it can offer I&#x27;ve not actually seen spelt out so thought I&#x27;d ask here.
 ​
 If you have a device Hybrid AAD Joined can you log into it using your AAD credentials (username@upn) and it will authenticate against AAD or do Hybrid devices still need line of site of a DC? 
 ​
 I ask because the type of ticket that comes up again and again is when a user resets their password and their AAD \ OnPrem password is updated they are still using cached credentials on their device which causes confusion. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m hoping Hybrid AAD would be a way to alleviate this issue but I&#x27;m coming up with squat while researching. Maybe my google-fu is failing me at today :)

                              <span>It&#x27;s been some month we have some random database crashes because of a Linux VPS that sometimes miss RAM and the oom_killer kills the DB because it&#x27;s the most consuming process.
 But to get more informations on what&#x27;s going on I am looking for a reliable way to monitor either the apache multiple virtual hosts I have (monitor them individually) and each DB individually on MariaDB.
 I&#x27;ve been trying Google Analytics, but it don&#x27;t show all requests on a site or the failing requests etc etc... So I was thinking about using Grafana, there is some module I can use with Apache mod_status extended. But this sounds like not really &quot;professional&quot;, it uses a github module to export status on prometheus, and then I have to re-code some part to get the extended status which interests me... Also I saw I can monitor databases with Grafana, so it sounds fine to me. Maybe some of you have good or even better solutions?
 Thanks

                              <span>Is there any way this can be done without going to the site and connecting directly?
 The problem is that the Switch is still running on default Configuration, thus having an IP of 192.168.0.254/24 if I remember correctly. We have a connection to the network there, but it is in the network 10.100.20.xx/24.
 The way we did it before was going there, connecting directly, changing our IP to the Switches Default-Network and connecting that way.

                              <span>Has anyone gotten smart card authentication working using pam_pkcs, pcsc-lite and coolkey for a virtual machine in subject hosted in VMware workstation player/pro? I&#x27;ve got it partially working to recognize the card, prompt for pin, check user principal name in the card certs to match against AD account, then finally login. But issue comes when machine goes to lock enabled screensaver after some idle time, the user tries to unlock but it never prompts for PIN though it might say please insert your card. If you manually lock and unlock within a few minutes, it seems to load the smart card module and prompt for PIN then login in. If it&#x27;s been idle for a longer time, it fails to recognize the smart card and user has to reboot machine for it to be recognized again. Reading online the solutions I&#x27;ve come across are using VMware horizon client but I don&#x27;t have licensing or setup for that. The issue is also supposedly fixed in RHEL 8 with a newer version of pcsc-lite. I have also turned on gdm debugging and have seen a few errors regarding account expiration policy not found and the pam_pkcs module failing to load. Not sure why if during initial login it works 100% of the time. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s unreliable USB redirection with the VMware player and card reader so I&#x27;m gonna try installing the image directly on a machine to circumvent using VMware player/workstation software.

 One of our guys just renamed a user who just left so access was the same etc, I wondered what everyone&#x27;s take on this is? 
 Do you just rename if the position is like for like or do you create a new user from scratch?

 ​
 Patching is great for security perspective yet &quot;just patch the systems&quot; is a naive take. In order to keep systems available and secure at the same time, a thorough and working patch management technology (along with people and processes but out of scope of the question here) needs to be manageable, too.
 RHEL has Satellite, Windows has WSUS and so many 3rd parties exist for the ecosystem. If the environment is not fully RHEL, Satellite is not enough. WSUS does not patch 3rd party applications, so we need another solution for that. Also, you need two solutions if you pick the default ones, so a 3rd party looks like better but comes with cost. So many trade-offs.
 Aside from all the marketing online and tools in Google search result first 5 pages, what do you do to solve this puzzle? I mean your experience, by the way, not the names of possible tools only.

                              <span>So I own a small computer repair business and have set up a small lab of six computers along with the computer I would use to teach with so that would make seven. I want to be able to teach people how to install specific software and then roll back the changes perhaps on reset. I know there is software to do this but so far I&#x27;ve tried some of the demos and I&#x27;m not happy with the results. I&#x27;m not super familiar with Windows server as most of my server experience has to do with Linux, is this something I can do with perhaps active directory or other Windows server features I&#x27;m not aware of. I have no problem learning the software and can put as much time into it as needed. I have a VM for Windows server 2022 already running blue iris and some other window specific services. I&#x27;m currently using proxmox on my server at work, but at the moment besides providing some system backups to the NAS the computer lab is currently independent of the server.

                              <span>It appears that ghostscript have decided to disable the silent install option as of GS 10.01.0. Their apparent reasoning is that gs has been bundled with 3rd party software, not kept up to date, and they get grief. Then they say that it&#x27;s trivial to rebuild from source with the silent option enabled. Great, so the 3rd party software providers that compile their own software can easily rebuild the installer and keep bundling gs, but I, with no software compilation skills, can&#x27;t keep it up to date on managed end user&#x27;s PC&#x27;s....
 Sorry rant over.

                              <span>Microsoft recommends decommisioning old DCs and replacing with new, rather than in-place upgrades. This is very quick and simple, but my question is around best practice if your old DC is also your DNS server. DHCP clients are not a problem, but statically configured devices will still reference the old DC IP address as the DNS server. 
 For larger enterprises, I think implementing separate DNS resolvers is likely the best solution, but in the smaller business case I&#x27;m dealing with, continuing to use the DC as the DNS server may be the better solution, so how do I deal with this? E.g.:
  
Should I replace DC with new one at new IP and then manually go and update all statically configured devices decommissioning old DC: possibly very time consuming and easy to miss items
 Set up new DC, demote and decommission old DC and then change new DC&#x27;s IP address to match the old decommissioned DC&#x27;s IP address?
 Something else?

                              <span>After struggling with Comcast and Verizon, I’ve been quoted a decent rate by Crown Castle for 10gig fiber to my Condo building. We would simply charge everyone $100 a month for Internet.
 However, I’m wondering if this is enough for 40 units. Without any shaping or prioritization in place, what happens if a unit decides to download torrents all evening? What if 2-3 people do? 
 Will most network equipment attempt to balance by default or will data simply be dropped and slow to a crawl?

                              <span>Hey Folks,
 Hope you all are doing well. Looking for some help, suggestions, and insights.
 We are in the process of engaging multiple vendors to procure and implement firewalls for our new large medical facility. 
 For internal/data center and perimeter firewalls, specifically, two questions: do we need to use multi-vendors for these firewalls, and if so, which vendor should be used for the perimeter network - Fortinet or Palo Alto?
 We have asked all the vendors about multi-vendor approach for the data center and perimeter, but nobody could give any convincing answer.
 Also, we are considering using Sophos XGS as a Data Center Firewall. Do you have any experience with this product? Is it a good choice for implementing a Data Center Firewall?
 Thank you in advance for your responses.

 Apparently the Pacstar 447 is a ESR6300

                              <span>We have a SolarWinds server that is on our internal network. We have it pretty locked down so the only internet access it has is a whitelist of SolarWinds domains so it can update. During some downtime, I decided to look at the Okta setup procedure. I fully expected I would have to open up our firewall policies a bit to get it to work.
 To my surprise it worked with the default configuration. I double checked the FW logs and see no traffic being routed to the internet that isn&#x27;t being allowed by our one URL whitelist rule.
 I am admittedly not experienced with SAML, would this be expected or am I overlooking something with our firewall configuration allowing traffic that we shouldn&#x27;t be? Is it because the user device is forwarding the SAML response?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m a SWE at one of the major companies in the networking industry (working on Layer 3 stuff mostly). I jumped in shortly after graduating and have been working here for ~9 months now.
 I wanted to get some insight from those who started in a similar role or are just in the industry:
  
Where are you now? (Industry, role, company)
 Did you stay in the networking space or pivot to a different industry, and why?
 What advice would you give someone just starting out in the space on what career path to take for best employment prospects and earnings?
 Did you regret starting your career in/staying in networking?
 What is the compensation and attainability of upper-level roles in this industry like compared to others?
 Any specific domain of networking that you recommend specializing in? 
  
I personally enjoy various aspects of my job and learning about the intricacies of networking. However, my worry is that the knowledge I&#x27;m learning is fairly niche and there aren&#x27;t that many companies hiring folks in this industry compared to something like a Backend Developer which virtually every company needs. So I&#x27;m contemplating whether I should pivot to other roles since I&#x27;m still early in my career and won&#x27;t get boxed-in to a specific sector, and was hoping hear some opinions on the above questions to help guide me!

                              <span>Management dropped a pet project in our lap, *first time?.png* To stay on schedule we&#x27;re robbing Peter to pay Paul (dammit Paul you don&#x27;t even work here anymore) with inventory we have on hand. The project needs C9300s stacked in 3s and 4s in various IDFs. We have the 9300s but not the stack kits.
 We cannot wait for stack kits, the lead times exceed the project timeline. The question becomes: &quot;Are the 9300s worth stacking after they&#x27;re already in production?&quot; My OCD screams yes, and it would eliminate some daisychaining in a couple IDFs. However, it would require careful planning and at least one maintenance window per IDF to stack them together. I&#x27;m not sure if the juice is worth the squeeze.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>I ran nmap today on the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet (which we aren’t using.)
 It found four devices. Interestingly, when ran arp -a on my windows laptop, the device at .2 was showing a MAC address of a Unifi device, which is also what nmap said. nmap advised port 22 was open on .2 but there were no ports open for a web server. 
 When I navigated to the IP address I was presented with the login screen of a Zyxel WAP, which I successfully logged into. 
 My working theory is that there are two devices running the same IP and that the laptop has cached the MAC for the Unifi, and as it isn’t running a web server when I navigate to its IP in chrome I am getting the page for the Zyxel. Does that sound correct / plausible?
 If so, I will change the static IP set on the Zyxel and go from there.

                              <span>I have an internal Asset Management/Ticketing software and portal that I&#x27;d like to make available externally. I&#x27;ve only ever done this with locally hosted exchange servers. The actual process of configuring the NAT I get, but I&#x27;m concerned about the security implications. The portal itself is password protected against AD creds and uses a single port on the host VM server. I don&#x27;t plan on adding it to our public DNS instead having managed machines access it via link posted on their desktops. Any ACLs I would need to put in place to block other traffic?
 Since locally hosted Exchange servers basically do the same thing, except with published DNS, so I can&#x27;t imagine there would be too much to consider, but I&#x27;d certainly rather be safe than sorry.

 We have a couple of sites, each with multiple pairs of Fortigate firewalls with various vDOMs configured. Each vDOM has one or more vlan interfaces which carry client LAN, DMZ, DB networks etc, and there’s a WAN interface too. These are all connected to a common edge stack with the necessary vlan IDs allowed on the switchports.
 If we wanted a VM on vlan 101 which is served by FGT pair 1, to access a VM on vlan 201 which is served by pair 2, currently we would set up a vlan interface for vlan 101 on FGT pair 2 with say 10.10.101.253 as the IP, and a static route on pair1 for 10.10.201.0/24 via 10.10.101.253.
 This is starting to get a bit unmanageable and I want to look at setting up dynamic routing acr…</span>

                              <span>Hello. It is my understanding, from the manufacturer data sheets, that the Adtran NetVanta 1550 series switches, and specifically the 1550-24 model, will support 10Gbps fiber SFP modules. Although this is a older series of switches, we have a large number of them. I was wondering if anyone is actually running that 10Gbps configuration, and if you have had good success, problems or other advice as we consider how to go from our existing 1Gbps backbone to 10Gbps. Thank you.

 Figuring out the number of uplinks from ToR &gt; Spine &gt; fabric Spine is making me kinda crazy. Anyone know of some formula that exists for figuring this out? It’s all going to be 400G uplinks with servers attached at 100G
 I suck at math.

                              <span>I apologize in advance for my novice level of knowledge in Networking.
 I&#x27;m building a small server rack and in looking for RJ45 couplers I&#x27;ve seen some listed as CAT5e, CAT6, CAT7 etc,. I was under the impression that CATx was in reference to a standard for the cables themselves rather than the connector. I suspect it has to do with the shielding but I wanted to check with the pros.
 I have attempted to search for the answer online without success.
 Example: If I&#x27;m using CAT8, connecting to a rack coupler that&#x27;s labeled as CAT5e will there be a significant drop in performance? Or does the coupler itself not impact the performance as long as the cables themselves (on both ends of the coupler) are up to the CAT8 standards?

 We are looking to have a https wildcard certificate secured guest portal with employee sponsorship with CoA vlan change so they don’t have to switch SSIDs once approved.
 We are also looking for a similar portal for BYOD where employees log in with their azure AD creds and get a CoA to a BYOD vlan once authenticated.
 We have tried XMC-SE/NAC, A3 and now Cisco ISE. We keep having issues with redirecting and difference in action based on the client depending on if using HTTPS, HTTP or FQDN. We’ve also had issues with CoA not working with ISE. We’ve purchased consulting hours through extreme and Cisco and aren’t having much luck.
 Curious if anyone has gotten this working and what products and methods you use?

                              <span>Hello, all. I have a legacy OTV environment that I am troubleshooting as there are connectivity issues, While reviewing the configuration I noticed a pattern in the OTV overlay instances. Here is an example:
 service instance 998 ethernet
 encapsulation dot1q 998
 mac access-group filter_fhrp out
 bridge-domain 998
 Looking at the documentation, I see this being configured as an in-bound filter, not as the out-bound filter like in the config &quot; mac access-group filter_fhrp out&quot;. Why might this be configured as an outbound filter?
 Here is a simple topology example. The OTV configuration exists on A-CR01 &amp; B-CR01. An example of an issue is reachability to the internet from hosts connected to B-CS01. A-CS01 is the only device with internet access.
 A-CS01 ---&gt; A-CR01  B-CR01 &lt;--- B-CS01

                              <span>This seems like it should have a simple answer, but I&#x27;ve done that many Google searches that Google stopped me to make sure I was human, and there wasn&#x27;t a simple answer amongst all the searches I tried.
 If I have a NPS/Packetfence/Clearpass/FreeRadius running in a VM(HyperV) and I have a single 802.1x capable switch and I want port auth on every port on the switch including the one that NPS is running from, how do I deal with the NPS authorising itself?
 This sounds right but seems wrong: is it as simple as having a management VLAN that the switch can talk to NPS on and that VLAN in HyperV NIC for that VM is either tagged/untagged so that the switch can communicate without needing to authorise itself? 
 That still seems flawed if someone knew the VLAN ID albeit minimal access would be possible in it(1812,1813 exposed at most I would have thought)

                              <span>Hello all, in my Isp we have a srx1400 router as the primar router. After that we have an Ex3300 switch. The switch doesn’t communicate with router. Any idea what’s the problem? Or how to configure the port trunk. Any help is accepted. Thanks in advance

                              <span>One of the top posts on /r/networking is this one about Fiber Optics
 But it’s very outdated now. Now we have MTO/MTP, Channelization (break-out) 100Gbps to 25Gbps, 40Gbps to 10Gbps, etc. The ins and outs of MTO/MTP.. type A vs type B polarity, male vs female, patch panel break out panel… it’s all extremely complex and difficult to get straight.
 This would be an extremely valuable post!

                              <span>What lead times for switching/routing gear are you seeing at the moment?
 It seems that things are improving across the board so wanted to check what hardware delivery lead times people are getting. 
 I’m particularly interested in Cisco, Juniper and Arista.

 Anyone know a really working VPN in China?
 Some of my european colleagues must go for business trip in China and must communicate with our office and ERP.
 I need the best reliable VPN cause our IT Dpt cannot contact the colleagues if VPN doesn&#x27;t work.
 I have read about Astrill that it&#x27;s good and working in China.
 Some advise?
 There is something better and reliable?
 There is also private corporate IpSec tunnel allowed from China to out?
 Thanks

 I have a bit of time at work right now, as I am waiting on our service providers. 
 Since I&#x27;m the only one in IT and I have no documentation from my predecessor, I&#x27;d like to get more involved with our Firewalls.
 Couldn&#x27;t really find good ressources, do you have any tips? I thought about setting up a Firewall (pfsense) try around there, but I&#x27;d like to understand the fundamentals more (drop, deny, accepts, setting rules etc).
 Thank you for any guidance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am currently experiencing a weird networking issue at work. Link at the bottom for abstracted architecture.
 We have two ISPs and two firewalls in different buildings.
 The ISP Routers are connected to a switch, whose only purpose is to connect both Firewalls (Fortigate) to the ISP router in case of firewall failure.
 Outgoing traffic gets replies that are properly handled by the firewall (doesn&#x27;t seem to be a L1-L3 problem on the side of the ISP).
 Incoming traffic however does not get handled properly - Pings from WAN to the interface do not receive a reply, Port forwarding does not work either. On the other interface the configuration is the same but it works.
 When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP1s network (1.1.1.2), there is no reply.
 When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP2s network (2.2.2.1), there is a reply.
 When capturing network traffic on switch 1 (traffic on the interfaces that are connected to the firewalls, both directions) i can see that the ping request gets sent to the active firewall. There is no reply though.
 When i plug a laptop into the switch 1 and give it the IP address of the router (1.1.1.1, no further addresses available sadly) i get a reply to the ping.
 The firewalls are fortigates, they are configured as active/active but from what i&#x27;ve gathered only the primary firewall handles traffic, the secondary firewall gets used to offload security processing.

 Any ideas what i could look into further?
 Thanks a lot!

 Can ping all logical addresses. Have rebuilt the VSS stack multiple times using the VSS cisco guide. No interface errors No output log errors

However I noticed a good handful of them are blinking a steady amber at the exact same time and in unison. The end devices connected to those ports seem like they&#x27;re fine, but I don&#x27;t have a clue as to why they&#x27;re showing a different visual indication than the rest. Any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying for Nokia&#x27;s NRS II certification and am taking their IS-IS practice exam. I ran into a question I got wrong, but I can&#x27;t understand why the answer they give is correct. Can anyone explain why C is the correct answer to this?
 Here&#x27;s my thought process:
  
A is false because the L1 LSP includes all subnets directly attached to the router itself, not the entire area.
 B is false because the L1 LSP wouldn&#x27;t include subnets advertised by R6 since it&#x27;s in another area.
 C is the correct answer, but I thought the L2 LSP included all subnets attached to routers in the area in which the L1/L2 router resides (which is why I chose D), not just itself.
  
Their own lab guide for this exam has this statement for the section where you configure a multi-area topology which seems to contradict this question: &quot;display the details of the level-2 LSP advertised by your P router. Observe that it only includes level-2 capable neighbors in its topology information and that it includes all the area subnets in its IP reachability information, not just the subnets that are directly attached to it.”

I heard that the backup destination passes heartbeat information and if the connection is lost VLTi will go down. Is this true?

 I work for an investment fund that is small in terms of people, but we manage a reasonable amount of assets and we&#x27;re buying/selling publicly traded securities, so having our internet be rock-solid is important. We are currently using Spectrum HFC in our office and we&#x27;ve been pretty unhappy with speeds and uptime. All of our computers are on a VPN that is Arizona based, and we will often have 3 - 4 people with Bloomberg terminals open, downloading medium-sized files from our file system (i.e., via the VPN) while on Zoom calls. There are ~10 people in the office at any given time.

 Our users are experiencing voice issues from hard phones, whether the handset, headset, or speaker is being used, call quality is cutting in and out, sometimes there&#x27;s static, sometimes robotic, other times it&#x27;s &#x27;like the caller is underwater.&#x27;
 We have about 50 sites and each site has anywhere between 5-50 users, based on the size of the site. 
 I currently have about 5 of the bigger sites, ranging between 25-50 users complaining about voip problems. Phone calls cutting in and out, not being able to hear the caller. 
 Please note: We don&#x27;t manage our own Voip solution, that&#x27;s outsourced to an MSP, the MSP says it&#x27;s not them, when they request call examples and listen to the pcaps they come back clear. 
 While each site is different …</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I know very little about Metro Ethernet. So for those of you who have experience with this, I was wondering why (if both are offered by a Provider) one would ever select an E-Line service instead of an E-LAN service? From a quick glance, it would seem that E-LAN is much more scalable if you need to connect future remote offices. Is there a huge difference in the cost or something? I also don&#x27;t know why anyone would ever select E-Tree over E-LAN. Thanks in advance for any insight you can offer!

If we disable the adapter through GPO is there any website out there that absolutely 100% actually requires ipv6/teredo tunneling that this would effect? As it is we are blocking teredo traffic that is not going out to microsoft on our firewall but it would be easier if we could just turn it off altogether.

                              <span>Hey guys, I have a few questions regarding routing and firewall rules with the UDMP and unifi gateway products.
 We have a large 172.30.x.x /17 network with each site having a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro and being allocated a /21 subnet. Our AWS VPC network is 172.31.x.x/16.
 Routing between sites is handled via IPSEC vpn tunnels to a VyOS router in AWS EC2. This facilitates routing between each /21 and the 172.31.x.x networks.
 I am confused about how the firewall rules are supposed to be setup in Unifi network.
 I want to allow all traffic from 172.30.x.x/17 and 172.31.x.x/16 to go in and out of each other UDMP, as well as ping each other&#x27;s WAN interfaces. I&#x27;ve created a group on each UDMP containing these networks/subnets, to be used to apply to each rule&#x27;s &quot;address group&quot;.
 How many rules do I need to apply? and on which interfaces? (WAN OUT, WAN IN, WAN LOCAL, LAN IN, LAN OUT, LAN LOCAL). This is a simple configuration that is made difficult in my head due to all the various directoins and interfaces.
 Next question, there&#x27;s a radio button to &quot;don&#x27;t match on IPSEC traffic&quot; when creating rules. Do I want this checked or not? All of the connections between sites are IPSEC tunnels, all inter-site traffic will be traversing an IPSEC tunnel. This is made even more confusing with the 3 options:&quot;Don&#x27;t match on IPSEC traffic&quot;&quot;Match inbound IPSEC traffic&quot;&quot;Match inbound non-IPSEC traffic&quot;
 Any insight would be appreciated. I would appreciate it if only those who have direct experience working with this exact interface would respond. I understand the idea and fundamentals of how this is supposed to work, however when applying rules the outcome isn&#x27;t as you would expect. So I want to know the &quot;proper&quot; or &quot;intended&quot; way that these options are supposed to be used.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m having some trouble setting in a Fortigate IPsec VPN in Azure. We&#x27;ve had the Fortigate NVA set up with HA in Azure for years (set up by others, not me).
 ​
 I need to set up an IPsec VPN so users can remotely connect into the environment. I cannot use the Azure VPN at this moment due to it being used for other reasons and it has a very restrictive NSG on its subnet.
 I followed the article here (https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/5.6.0/cookbook/589121/ipsec-vpn-with-forticlient) yet I&#x27;m not able to connect via the client. I get this error when trying to connect:

 VPN connection failed. Please check your configuration and network connection, then retry your connection. If the problem persists, contact your network administrator for help. 
 In my VPN client config I&#x27;m using a public IP from the load balancer. There are two load balancing rules to map UDP ports 500 and 4500 to the backend (the two Fortigate VMs in HA). 
 If I run the command below I can see my client is trying to connect:
 diagnose sniffer packet any &quot; host myclientip and port (500 or 4500)&quot; 4 0 l Using Original Sniffing Mode interfaces&#x3D;[any] filters&#x3D;[ host 142.113.161.68 and port (500 or 4500)] 2023-05-02 19:14:04.734193 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:07.870742 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:07.870746 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:10.910803 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:10.910806 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:13.937669 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:13.937672 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 
 I&#x27;m at a loss of what to check next. Any guidance or assistance would be very much appreciated.

                              <span>I am trying to get the received/sent byte fields from Netflow from our Meraki MX67. I saw a similar question to this online but that&#x27;s because they were using v5 and only v9 sends output messages.
 Anyone have any luck with Logstash and getting that field?
 My current output looks like below:
  &quot;host&quot; &#x3D;&gt; { &quot;ip&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;10.210.73.1&quot; }, &quot;@version&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;1&quot;, &quot;@timestamp&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 2023-05-02T17:59:06.000Z, &quot;netflow&quot; &#x3D;&gt; { &quot;in_pkts&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 44, &quot;in_bytes&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 6832, &quot;flow_seq_num&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 121282, &quot;ipv4_dst_addr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;10.213.73.251&quot;, &quot;protocol&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 17, &quot;l4_src_port&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 4500, &quot;input_snmp&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 1, &quot;l4_dst_port&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 35780, &quot;output_snmp&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 38, &quot;last_switched&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;2023-05-02T17:54:07.600Z&quot;, &quot;flowset_id&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 5206, &quot;version&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 9, &quot;first_switched&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;2023-05-02T17:54:04.660Z&quot;, &quot;ipv4_src_addr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;208.54.32.35&quot; } } 
 This is my config file for Logstash
 input { udp { port &#x3D;&gt; 2055 codec &#x3D;&gt; netflow { versions &#x3D;&gt; [9] } } } output { # Output events that match the filters to stdout stdout { codec &#x3D;&gt; rubydebug } # Output to a local file { path &#x3D;&gt; &quot;loggingforme.txt&quot; codec &#x3D;&gt; rubydebug } }

                              <span>Our edge routers currently do not have an ACL on their internet-facing interfaces. These are our internet edge routers which run eBGP with our ISPs. I&#x27;m trying to research best practices for this ACL.
 I&#x27;m on an ASR1K. Here is my latest draft:
 ip access-list extended INET permit icmp any any echo-reply # Only allow responses to ICMP echo initiated internally permit tcp any any established # Allow TCP traffic for sessions initiated internally permit ip  any # Allow our other DCs to freely communicate with each other permit tcp any any eq 179 # Allow BGP peering permit tcp any eq 179 any # Allow BGP peering deny any any 
 I&#x27;m concerned about adding this ACL as the ASR1K is not a stateful device. Therefore, I think it will drop return UDP packets. This is highly concerning as we use UDP-based applications extensively. Due to UDP being a connection-less protocol, there is no such thing as permit udp any any established.
 Can anyone suggest best practices for an ACL like this? Is there a document from a major vendor with examples? How do ISPs handle this scenario? I&#x27;m struggling to find relevant resources on Google.

                              <span>I hope this isn&#x27;t too low level for the sub, but I do need a sanity check here.
 I have to automate a few facilities with IoT gear. The best solution I found is based on using specific hardware from China to gather the data and control devices.
 As &quot;server&quot; I have a small Beelink machine, which should work just fine for the task. The communication is over MQTT.
 Now, the CEO is worried that there may be adversarial code on those devices and wants me to ensure everything is safe.
 Initially I thought I could just cut those devices off from the Internet at the router/firewall. 
 Lying in bed tonight at 2h30am I figured I could also just have two physical networks. One for the hardware I/O and one that communicates with our server on the web. Were not running centrifuges here. The motivation for an elaborate attack should be minimal.
 The on-site server would then need two NICs. It has one ethernet on board and maybe get another via USB or use Wifi.
 This seemed like a good idea at first, but then I remembered a story from way back when in the 90s.
 I worked for a large company that had large banks as their clients. One of my colleagues was the blessed one that had a direct network connection into one of those banks besides the one into the local network.
 However for some reason that I don&#x27;t remember his computer acted as router between those two networks. Obviously that shit got shut down real quick once the banks IT department caught wind of it.
 Is this something unavoidable or can I reliably configure this possibility away? The server runs on Debian.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have a client that is implementing a new DR site, he wants to recreate all the same subnets that he has in HQ exactly as it is in DR with the same gateway even the same Public IP for online pubished services. He has that idea in mind to do a seamless failover in case something wrong went to the VM without any manual intervention. Is this really possible. What are the side backs and the cons if any. I should mention that this client is an ISP so he controls the mpls network between the sites

 My plan is to set up an old laptop and have that streaming out the security video. Does anyone know of a website that would allow a sign in to view stream? Or a different subreddit to ask this in if my question doesn&#x27;t fit here? 
 I contemplated port forwarding the camera access ports but nothing in the documentation says if this will work or not.

 In this example my ASN is 65444 and my upstream is 65443. I plan on moving to another host and having them both live at the same time lets use 65442 as the new provider, how can I set it so that when both are live my old upstream 65443 will stop routing my IP ranges and 65442 will be the priority route. I beleive I can do this with prepend but I am not sure how the config should look on both ends.

                              <span>Hey folks, so was recently upgrading from UniFi to Aruba AP 515 for one of our client. During that in initial setup we choose country, after choosing India the APs decided to just not broadcast any SSID whatsoever spent my entire evening troubleshooting that. Turns out 510series has some country code issue. 
 So is it the device fault OR that particular model isn’t supported in my region? Very curious to know the RC.

The idea is to pass access management of folders or teams off to department leaders for Managment. I see this being a disaster from a management standpoint as a system administrator. Wondering if anyone here has every completely dropped files servers and moved over to teams. How did it go?

                              <span>Dear fellow SysAdmins,
 Despite having left my previous toxic position near my house, I encountered an unexpected setback at my new job. I had given my previous employer two weeks&#x27; notice and was due to start at a client of an MSP company on May 1st. However, the start date was postponed to May 15th due to unforeseen circumstances.
 I have received news that the new MSP company that I would have been working at, is shutting down and they will no longer be able to offer me the position. As a result, I am now without a job and must begin the job hunt anew.
 I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or advice that you all may have on what I should do in the meantime. Furthermore, I have a legal question regarding the employment agreement letter that I signed. As a resident of the NYC area, I am wondering if there are any laws that protect my rights in this situation, pay wise, or if I am out of luck.
 Thank you all for your time and assistance.

                              <span>Our Network Engineering team is rolling out new subnets for most locations, and the range of address space they’re choosing is 172.32.x/24, 172.33.x/24, etc. They’re up to 172.44.x.x now, I think, and quite a few have been rolled out.
 I think they just didn’t realize that the RFC 1918 class B network range ends at 172.31.255.255, and now we’ve got public ip ranges inside our corporate network and are seeing various kinds of issues like excess prompts to authenticate to cloud providers. I asked about the ranges used for the new subnets and got a “Cisco said it’s OK,” in response so all I’ve done is indicate that I think it merits looking into, but no one’s looked into it. 
 Have any of you heard about the range 172.32.0.0-172.44.255.255 being used internally for private addressing? I’ve seen it done before, but only out of ignorance, and correcting it is always painful. Everything I’ve read and heard from past coworkers says this is a very bad thing to do, but the people doing it now disagree, and they’re VERY confident they’re right. Which is a little terrifying.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>A quick story for you. I just found myself on the wrong side of some malicious compliance. For years, I&#x27;ve had issues with Dell support. I&#x27;m sure we all have. My particular issue stems from their refusal to contact me via email. They always call. I don&#x27;t WANT a phone call. Chances are I&#x27;m working on a different issue, on a different call, my mind&#x27;s on another task, and I don&#x27;t want to just drop everything. Especially if we&#x27;re talking about a Sev3 or so where I just need a little guidance. Email&#x27;s great, I can wrap up my current thought and then pivot to the support request.
 Since I can&#x27;t get them to stop calling, and I&#x27;m tired of simply ignoring their call and then responding to the ticket as though I didn&#x27;t notice, I wanted to force the issue. You can&#x27;t remove your phone number entirely - it wants numbers in that box. But, it turns out the box isn&#x27;t cross referencing with telco providers to ensure the phone numbers are legitimate. So a couple months I put some nonsense in there which would make it flatly impossible to call me, and promptly forgot I&#x27;d ever done so. Yeah you probably see this conclusion coming.
 Last Monday I opened an SR, and as the week dragged on, the silence started to grow more suspicious. By this morning it was clear that my SR had landed in the wrong queue, so I pull up the support site to check the status of the SR. Closed due to lack of customer contact because they were unable to reach me on the phone. I mean, of course you were unable to reach me, you can&#x27;t dial 111-111-1111, it&#x27;s simply not a thing. What the bloody hell list did I end up on where these people will not just email me? I&#x27;m leaving the number in there, I guess I&#x27;ll just CC every account exec I&#x27;ve ever crossed paths with on every SR from now on with &quot;My preferred method of contact is by email&quot; pasted between every paragraph of every ticket I submit.
 Ahh Dell, you useless, useless company.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve implemented a new help system at my place of employment after a merger and I&#x27;m trying to coach my new users on putting in tickets correctly. I originally hid the option to select a priority when submitting a ticket but now that I have people putting in emergency requests that are not emergencies, I&#x27;ve decided to unhide priority, but I already have users putting all of their tickets in as high priority, even though they aren&#x27;t. 
 Other than warning people about the boy who cried wolf (i.e., if all of your tickets are high priority, we will start treating them as if they aren&#x27;t and the one time you actually do need help quickly, you won&#x27;t get it and it&#x27;s all your fault), what&#x27;s the best way to communicate this to your users? Or have you had any luck at all with this?

                              <span>I work in a medium-sized organization running a hybrid environment. Our ticketing system is AD synced so when a user locks themselves out of their company account, they must call the help desk to unlock the account. My question is how do you verify your user&#x27;s identity when they call for account unlocks?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to find some correlating events to understand why we had some users have their user profiles nuked overnight and this morning. 
 We had probably 20-30 users now reporting that logging in this morning was like logging into a fresh computer. This doesn&#x27;t appear to be a normal corrupt profile situation, their profile was deleted and created fresh upon login. 
 Sometime overnight you can see the EventID 1 from Search-ProfileNotify saying the Windows Search Service indexed data for the user and it was successfully removed in response to user profile deletion. When they login you see a similar event that their profile is being created. What I&#x27;m trying to figure out is what in the world would have caused this request to happen. Are there no event ID&#x27;s tied to a requested profile deletion or what triggered it?
 No Windows updates were deployed this week either. Basically looking for any advice that might lead me down a breadcrumb trail to figuring out what in the world happened. And also why it only effected this small amount of users.

                              <span>The short-short version of the story is that my new PowerEdge R650 servers came with the System Profile Setting &quot;Performance-Per-Watt (DAPC)&quot; which refers to the Dell Active Power Controller. With DAPC in control of CPU frequency scaling the cpufreq driver would not load and I was stuck at the base CPU speeds. The fix is to change the System Profile to Performance and let the OS control CPU frequency scaling. This unlocks OS control of CPU turbo speeds and gave me an instant 1 GHz boost per core.
 The dev team will be pleased that the new servers are no longer 30% slower than the rest of the fleet.

                              <span>Hello Everyone!
 I was recently having a conversation with a coworker, regarding PTO in IT. In this instance, when I refer to PTO, I am also referring to sick leave, and vacation time, just not holiday pay. We were discussing how many days the average (full-time, 9-5, Mon-Fri) IT person needs in order to maintain a healthy work/life balance. I’m thinking 15 days is a good average, and my coworker is thinking something closer to 20, but we would love to get more opinions on the matter.
 As a follow up to that, what would be the minimum PTO/Sick Leave/Vacation time package you would accept from a prospective new employer?
 ​
 EDIT: Every person is different, and answering this kind of question can be tricky considering the different needs of different people, for the sake of this discussion, I am mainly referring to averages, to make it somewhat easier to answer. I also wanted to put a disclaimer here that I am not saying everyone should be able to make 15 days work for them, but just on average that is what most people probably would need to maintain a healthy work/life balance. Absolutely nothing wrong with needing more than that, or less than that in my opinion.

                              <span>Heya, 
 First a bit of a disclaimer, I do sysadmin just part time in a small firm of 15 ish employees and don&#x27;t have much of a background in it other than being the only one here able to distinguish an .exe from a .pdf... 
 Discovered some weird logins on our exchange online to one account but originating in another country. After some password resets and talking to the user it seemed fine but then the third party were in again a few hours later. By now I figured my users computer was fucked and we took it offline while locking and/or resetting all their various accounts. Problem solved.
 Today when I got my hands on the computer I found the following:
 - Email received from a domain we generally trust (so they got compromised first) with a &quot;PDF&quot;, ofc its an .exe but with file extensions being hidden.
 - Inexperienced user had launched it just an hour before the first odd logins.
 - Running it (on an empty user, offline) does open a PDF in the default browser (firefox) but the location is /appdata/roaming/winupdate_2025/out.pdf which is neither the location or name of the original file.
 Curious about how it got access to logins / passwords at this point but exhausted my very shallow knowledge. Any tips for how to dig a little deeper on this?

 It got me thinking...does the nature of the job give us ADHD like tendencies or are there a lot of us that have been running blind forever and this line of work just clicks for us?
 My background is not just in sysadmin. I&#x27;m a DBA, Salesforce Admin, ERP admin so I wear a lot of hats in a small company where I take care of a lot.
 It feels like my brain is the result of my environment instead of the other way around.

                              <span>I have received notification of auto enablement of Security Defaults on my Microsoft tenant.
 I have no problem doing so as we already use per user mfa across the board, but I have a legacy app that needs to sign into mailboxes using imap to crawl and ingest their content.
 The vendor tells me OAuth will still work with Security Defaults enabled, however everything on Microsoft website says IMAP and POP are disabled when Security defaults is enabled.
 Can anybody confirm this one way or the other, I’m going to raise with MS as well but sometimes that’s not helpful…

                              <span>So basically our company has contracted another company to provide data collection on our machines and robots (similar to production manager and mattec). (was done without my consultation but thats another story). 
 Anyways, for the data collection to work, said company has been having their clients use a small home nat router at the machines/robots to give the robots a private IP and keep them off the network. 
 I said this is dumb to put a million little points of failure at every machine/robot we own. I asked if they&#x27;re is any other way to do this. They said, all the other companies they&#x27;ve done it to have gone this way. (apparently they&#x27;re all smaller places, we are decently sized and have more than one plant so ig we are the Guinea pigs?)
 My proposition is I just get a high end CISCO 9300 and just give the ports private NAT, would that be the best way to go about this? I&#x27;ve asked vendors if this would work and they are clueless, and my peers are just as clueless about it.

                              <span>I deployed my Windows 11 Image via MDT. Customised it, installed all the updates, then sysprepped/generalized and set it to boot to Out of Box Experience. I then created the sysprep &amp; capture task sequence via MDT. When i boot to that task sequence though I get errors that when googling seem to point to the fact that I have sysprepped too early.
 Can anyone confirm this before I start the process from the beginning without actually knowing if its going to work? Or let me know what I&#x27;m doing wrong because this process definitely should be easier than I&#x27;m making it out to be.

 Example: &gt;&gt;
 User then pays some amount a year or whatever to be [person@&gt;&gt;.com](mailto:person@customdomain.com) that&#x27;s just a forwarder. (or I suppose you could pay more for an actual mailbox). 
 Not sure if this is the place to ask but am hoping to get some ideas from this group.

                              <span>Hey there! I&#x27;m pretty new to redhat. I just started in a work-project and have the (questionable) honor to get a transaction monitor (openUTM) running. 
 That transaction monitor needs semaphore(s). And for the life of mine, I can&#x27;t seem to get it. I already found out, that &quot;ipcs&quot; shows me semaphores that are already there. But there are none. I think &quot;ftok&quot; should show me a number I can use to add a semaphore - but it won&#x27;t work, ftok always gets a syntax error. 
 I&#x27;m completely new to this, &quot;usually&quot; I&#x27;m just a dev for legacy-software. Any help would be wildly appreciated!

 They also described a mouse issue but it didn&#x27;t happen throughout the day. (not to mention I was 2 desk away and heard them having a complain about this issue. If I hadn&#x27;t have gone and asked the I guarantee I wouldn&#x27;t have heard about it)
 They have had this laptop for 2 months and said it&#x27;s been happening since they got it. 
 If you were in my shoes on the reply would you add a line to the effect of: In the future please be sure to let me know when issues start occurring, so that I can fix them before they intterupt you doing urgent work. 
 Or would you just let it sit? 
 And before you ask: Yes I&#x27;m responding to emails/tickets after hours, no they&#x27;ve never logged a ticket before, yes they know how to log tickets. 
 My question is more do I call them out on it or not?

                              <span>Hi all,
 One of our factories work with acidic baths. Since this is quite a corrosive environment we are looking in to a protective covers for these AP&#x27;s.
 We have found cover&#x27;s for these AP&#x27;s from Aruba itself, but we don&#x27;t think that these offer the protection necessary.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi all. After a bit of help. Working on a SR650 with Dual CPU and 14x 16GB of memory.
 Sales have sold an extra 4x 32GB to add to the system. I can&#x27;t get this working without it erroring.
 I think the issue is the location of the 32Gb dimms and the matching channels.
 I have the sr650 memory table for 18 dimms but this is no help with where to put the 32GB sticks.
 Is there a configuration helper somewhere or can someone advise?
 I&#x27;ve been using this table, at the bottom

                              <span>Out of the blue an employee, new to the business, wants to be able to attach files to PDF&#x27;s. If there&#x27;s a logical reason to do this, and the business is prepared to fund software licensing to support it (if agreed there will be a small group doing this), then I&#x27;m not aware of any reason to not support the request.
 However, is anyone here more knowledgeable on the above and is aware of any problems that may be caused / issues to be aware of? Wikipedia states that the ISO spec / standard for PDF files allows file attachments so in theory as long as any application (Adobe Acrobat, Foxit etc.) adheres to the standard there should be no problems?

                              <span>This seemed to sneak out at the back end of last week without too much fanfare but MS have announced an EOL date for Windows 10 (with the exception of LTSC versions which have extended support), with the final update releasing in October 2025 and 22H2 being the last feature update to be released.
 MS also announced that the first LTSC version of Windows 11 will launch in H2 of 2024.

 I spent the weekend looking at PowerAutomate, I wanted to know what are some good ideas that I could start implementing as beginner flows?
 Maybe connect it to JIRA for our MSP so when a ticket is updated, it adds it to my Microsoft Planner?

                              <span>I have a 2022 Hyper-V host, installed at Xmas time, which has been working well, except this month, when trying to patch it, I have been unable to get CU April installed. 
 I have tried installing from WU, and downloaded the CU manually from MS Catalog and tried to install it. 
 I have two errors. 
 0x800F081F and 0x80248007
 ​
 I tried running the update troubleshooter, no luck. I followed the instructions for resetting WU:
 Open the administrative Command Prompt and type the following commands one by one followed by Enter key.
 ​
 net stop wuauserv
 net stop cryptSvc
 net stop bits
 net stop msiserver
 Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
 Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
 net start wuauserv
 net start cryptSvc
 net start bits
 net start msiserver
 ​
 Also no luck. Not sure what I need to do to get this update installed. 
 Unfortunately due to an oversight (resolved for future), the last CU was December for Windows, though the Feb .net 3.5 CU was installed successfully. 
 ​
 ​
 Any bright ideas?

                              <span>So I just received a report on an external audit that was done by an external audit firm on the active directory policy at our organization. My question is how does some one go about auditing active directory? Does it mean they have access to the AD and check out the policies or they run it against a software to get the audit policies configurations? I am fairly new to this and I am learning a ton as I go along.

                              <span>Hi, I recently read that Microsoft intents to offer 365 admins to setup official Microsoft communication towards the 365 end-user with an email address from the company e.g., 365@company.com or microsoft@company.com. I can&#x27;t find it any longer and searching the internet, I only find articles that explain how to buy or configure microsoft 365.
 Fun fact, I tried the new Bing Chat and it sucked.
 Dear hive mind, help me find what I&#x27;m looking for.

                              <span>So apparently a line card broke somewhere in a Spectrum router in Dallas a few weeks ago, and it broke the majority of IPv6 connectivity in the area.
 I&#x27;ve worked with multiple content providers, from Akamai, Cloudflare, Microsoft, and AWS on mailing lists trying to (mostly successfully) route around the problem, but there&#x27;s still plenty of networks still unreachable.
 How do you even deal with an issue like this? This appears to affect hundreds of thousands of people in the DFW area from our tests asking people on the NANOG mailing list (i.e. unable to ping Quad9 IPv6), but Spectrum has been unable to give us a basic ETTR, even with our multiple Enterprise agreements. They&#x27;ve only assured us it falls under our SLA (which I guess is a good thing, at this point we have a lot of free service).
 If you work for Spectrum, please look at INC000026440632 and ECT-82023751, we are suffering.

                              <span>We are looking at potentially revamping our wireless. We currently have Aruba with an on-prem mobility controller. 106 total access points. We have some weak areas. I do know we would need to increase the amount of aps to increase footprint. Also we would need to beef up for 3 auditoriums. All that being said, Aruba has worked well for us and does well except we need more of them (not a fault of aruba).
 Currently have meraki switching. I&#x27;ve used meraki wireless in the past and it works well enough. I just hate the fact of the licensing with meraki. At least with our current aruba we buy license once and there isn&#x27;t an ongoing cost. 
 All that considered, we have a vendor willing to let us demo juniper/mist, meraki, aruba, or really anything we want. This is in a community college environment. 
 Thoughts? Recommendations? Things to look for during demo?

                              <span>EDIT: Thanks for your input everyone, keep it coming. I still think it&#x27;s better to cross the trunk but I&#x27;m soaking up all your comments to make as an informed decision as possible.
 We’re working on a new building and at the stage of terminating fiber trunks on patch panels.
 Everything is home run from each IDF to the MDF, there are no IDFIDF trunks.
 We’re terminating on duplex LC patch panels.
 The tech doing the termination and I are at loggerheads about how they should terminate. He says they always terminate them straight through (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, etc), but this means we will have to either stock different types of patch cables (crossed and straight) or mess around with rebuilding the duplex LC at one end of the patch cable.
 I’m saying they should be terminating with crossed pairs (1-2, 2-1, 3-4, 4-3, etc) which would allow us to use crossed patch cables everywhere, whether we’re connecting switchswitch within the rack or switchpatchpatchswitch.
 Is there a best practice to this?

                              <span>Hello! 
 I am really hoping for some help and guidance here.. 
 So a little bit of background about my environment. 
 I am currently updating my company&#x27;s switches. I purchased one Cisco 9300 to use as my core switch and then two 48 port Cisco 9200 switches to use as access switches.
 We have about 50 computers and Polycom VV350 IP phones and I have a eSXI host running a domain controller. 
 I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have the new switches and eSXI host running in a “test” environment so I can get this figured out before implementing my entire infrustructure, but everything is currently working in our production network. Ive been doing a lot of trial and error, but mostly errors.... 
 I don’t have a CCNA and Im not very fluent with Cisco, so Im wondering if there is a way to set this up from …</span>

 I entered a password including a quotation mark and a percentage symbol („ and %).
 The password doesn’t work when logging in.
 I know how to reset the switch to factory defaults. But a) I would like to not have to configure all the VLANs again and b) over the past decades I have encountered such problems with old networking equipment. A few times there were alternative ways of getting back in when „bad“ special characters where used. Once replacing it with an ASCII code worked and once I could truncate the password up until the bad special character.
 Anybody know a way or know any restrictions?
 Thanks for deleting my last post by the way. Top way of moderating.

 We have just refreshed the Palo Alto firewalls, and gone SASE with Prisma Access. Each branch office has a routed ipsec tunnel to both data centers. These offices have cisco 2960, aerohive APs and clustered Palo Alto 220/440 series firewalls.
 In each datacenter we have about 6 nexus core switches in VPC, and two ASR1001 as edge routers. Each data center has two ISP’s. Finally each data center has a F5-cluster and a Palo Alto cluste…</span>

Upon checking in Cisco DNAC, I found that the wireless access point (WAP) the client is connected to is showing high noise on the 5GHz spectrum. I changed the nearby WAP into sniffer mode to capture the traffic on the same channel as the WAP with high noise. I now have the packet capture in Wireshark, but I&#x27;m unsure of how to diagnose the problem. I tried searching for a solution to this problem on Google but didn&#x27;t find anything useful. Can you please guide me in the right direction? 
 I have temporarily placed the problem wap in down state

                              <span>Hi everybody, so to cut right to the chase I am able to get to the sonicwall admin login page but once I login it says that the connection was refused. I know I am using the right credentials when logging in. Any idea on how I could access the management console?

                              <span>Let’s be real, the job’s pretty similar place to place. Servers, firewalls, Office 365. Some places are always tough to do it in - lawfirms, non-profits, MSPs. 
 What are some of the best industries to be a sysadmin? Users are smart, budget is thick, projects are your own. I’m in healthcare consulting at the moment which is pretty smooth.

                              <span>Long story short, I was laid off about 2 months ago and have been looking for a job since. I have about 3 years experience working in help desk and a Jr. Sys admin role.
 Last week, I had two interviews with a small (less than 30 employees) MSP and I thought it went great, both interviewers seemed like good guys and the job would be challenging but I would learn a ton so I was very interested. After the final interview on Thursday, I was told to &quot;probably expect us to reach out soon&quot;.
 Lo and behold, I missed a call from them the next day at 7:30pm, followed by a text from them asking me to call them back when I was available. I text them back about 15 minutes later (when I see the missed call and text), letting them know that I&#x27;m currently out with friends and will call them back on Monda…</span>

                              <span>Hi!
 I want to force 2FA for all users and are searching for a nice USB desk stand.
 The goal would be a very heavy desk usb hub or usb extender or a keyboard with well accessible usb extender.
 How do you solve this? There are lots of small desk stands, but I could not find any really heavy ones (especially in europe).
 Thank you for your thoughts ITStril

                              <span>I’ve been working in IT for nearly 8 years now. I’ve gone from working in a hospital, to a MSP to now fruit production. Before I left the MSP I thought I’d hit my limit with IT. I just feel so incredibly burned out, the job just makes me so anxious all the time because if I can’t fix an issue I beat myself up over it, I always feel like I’m not performing well. I started this new job at the beginning of the year and it gave me a bit of a boost. The last couple of weeks I’ve started to get that feeling again as if this isn’t what I want to do but at the same time is it. I don’t know if I’m forcing myself to continue working in IT because it’s what I’ve done for most of my career or what. Does anyone else get this feeling because I feel like I’m just at my breaking point, I hate not looking forward to my job in the morning.

                              <span>Morning all, happy Monday! 
 Looking for some advice. We had previously removed the Windows 11 bloatware (Climpchamp, ESPN, Tiktok, Instagram, etc) from our Windows 11 Start menus using the follow group policy settings:
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Do not show Windows tips&quot; (Enabled)
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off cloud optimized content&quot; (Enabled)
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off Microsoft consumer experiences&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Do not suggest third-party content in Windows spotlight&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off all Windows spotlight features&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off the Windows Welcome Experience&quot; (Enabled) 
 This was tested and worked fine, implemented last month and worked fine. Now this morning I am seeing all the bloatware is back, even though my policies are in place. 
 Am I missing a setting, or is this crap finally unremovable? 
  
Edit: Found it, fixed it. Now to test and implement. Check the comments below. Thanks all for contributing!

But now I need to connect from Netsuite using RSA key but Netsuite doesn&#x27;t accept keys without a passphrase. I tried all possible ways even ChatGPT but all failed. I know how to create RSA keys with a passphrase. What I don&#x27;t know is how to force OpenSSH to accept new RSA key with a passphrase. Please help?

                              <span>Fairly new to an organization and just learned that on-prem AD and O365 do not sync. We have about 400 O365 users, of which 150 of those operate in one of our offices and are built in AD. This means that those 150 users technically have two different set of creds, even though they are likely the same. Apparently, it&#x27;s been like this for years and no one really knows why. Is there any reason you would not want it to sync? What are the potential downsides or gotchas if we were to sync? 
 It seems like syncing would allow for better password management, one place to manage at least some of the users (150 on-prem), better integration with Windows and syncing onedrive, etc. Anything else big to use as a benefit?

 At my previous company I have successfully manually remediated the &quot;Windows Security Feature Bypass in Secure Boot (BootHole)&quot; vulnerability on many Windows servers, however, I am tasked to do it for a few servers at my current company and for the life of me I cannot get it to work. I complete the steps from the Microsoft recommendation documentation on this page:

 ...however, I am facing the following error at the last set of running the Set-SecureBootUefi command:

                              <span>Good Morning,
 This past week I started to see an issue where some client machines on our LAN will acquire a link on a switch but its MAC address is not put into the MAC address table. This causes the machine to appear online to the user but it actually isn&#x27;t. Intranet and Internet are inaccessible. The only way to fix it is to reboot the machine. Disabling and re-enabling the NIC doesn&#x27;t appear to work.
 We have some older switches admittedly... Cisco SG500X-48p running latest firmware, set up in stacks with 4 member switches for each stack. I&#x27;m receiving complaints from users in two different stacks about this issue so I&#x27;m not sure if its happening to others at the moment.
 When a client machine can&#x27;t connect, I log into the switch they&#x27;re connected to and search for the client&#x27;s MAC add…</span>

 For those of you that have taken out cyber liability insurance policy, aside from this being a checkbox that corporate is looking for, from a technical perspective what sort of (if any) engagement do you have with the insurance provider?
 Has there been any sorts of onboarding calls with the provider to go over the claims process in the event of a cyber breach? Things like what we need to be prepared with before making a claim, etc.

 We have been able to do this Beyond Identity setup on Android, Mac OS, and iPad with no issues however, when we try to enable biometrics on Windows PCs that are domain joined it wants us to set up a pin and use the Microsoft authenticator app or go through our two-factor authentication provider. 
 Does anyone know of a way to just enable biometrics locally so we can integrate it with Beyond Identity without going through the entire integration process with the cloud etc?

                              <span>We are going to be replacing our core switches and since I don&#x27;t have rack space to mount new switch directly below/above old switch, I&#x27;ll have to fully unplug old switch, remove, rack new, replug cables. having cables numbered is going to be critical. 
 anyone have recommendations for a white/silver sharpy (some cables will be black)? I see oil based sharpy, something tells me that might not dry.

 I have a small company I am supporting in IT related topics. One of the users has a lot of spam mails incoming. Do you know any client solution that doesn’t necessarily need an email gateway installed? It could cost a few euros, that’s not a problem.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello,
 I wasn&#x27;t sure where put this post , at r/sysadmin or r/programming, so i decided write here.
 I am 18 yo and I&#x27;m in an IT technical school so just starting my way in IT.
 I have a dilemma because I don&#x27;t know what path to take. I&#x27;m very interested in systems administration,networks ( I passed CCNA) etc, but I also really like web programming (js and python html,css, etc). I&#x27;m graduating from technical school in a year, and I don&#x27;t plan to go to college just study in my own. I would like to ask you guys for some advice, because I totally don&#x27;t know what to choose and focus on something. I don&#x27;t want to do and learn several things at once, because it doesn&#x27;t benefit me much.

                              <span>So this happened. A long lost laptop was found in the company that was thought to be part of a rather large security incident we had 2 yrs ago. We really like to access the laptop.
 This is the case:
 - Boots successfully to the windows 10 login screen
 - Computer has bitlocked enabled, Bitlocker key itself is unknown however.
 - Computeraccount was removed from the domain and can not be restored anymore.
 - Because of this, no domain admin or other domain account works.
 - Previous user shown on login screen has unknown password, no other cached domain accounts.
 - Local admin account on the laptop is likely disabled and has an unknown password
 - BIOS is accessible
 We are most interested in a login to get the bitlocker key to enable decrypting the forensic backup.
 I&#x27;m really stuck here. Any thoughts?

 ​
 I manage an infrastructure composed of a main site and 10 secondary sites of small size (1-5 users)
 ​
 I have a main site with an email server and business software accessible in remoteapp (15 users). I have 3CX in telephony
 ​
 I have the choice between 2 providers who offer me
 ​
 Stormshield SN210 for the main site + SN160 for the remote sites
 or
 Zyxel USGFlex 700 + USG20 for the remote site
 ​
 Which one do you choose ?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 ​
 Recently i&#x27;ve set-up Passwordless Sign-In using Microsoft Authenticator for my organization. This works perfectly for all services connected to the users Microsoft Account. 
 I&#x27;ve tried looking into a way to use the MS Authenticator app as a Sign-In method for InTune enrolled devices (Windows 10/11). Does anybody know if this is available with the current MS Authenticator app?
 Thank you very much for any replies!

                              <span>Hi
 I have a question about a scheduled task
 If you have a scheduled task to run on a timer and the timer is one hour from the time the scheduled task is created. What happens if the user shuts down their machine before the hour ?
 Does the scheduled task never get to run? Does it run on next log on or next time the machine is turned on?
 The trigger is :
 Run powershell script after 60mins 
 Not after workarounds yet or different ideas. Just troubleshooting some that dont run and I want to know why first
 Thank you !

                              <span>I have inherited a Unifi Wifi network which uses RADIUS to authenticate computers onto an Active Directory domain. 
 Problem is, nearly every single laptop does NOT connect to wifi (v6) until the domain (or local) user logs in, and this is killing some, not all, of my GPO. 
 As an example, I set a GPO to add a local admin on laptops. That works. But if I try to deploy an .msi it fails miserably, with error logs telling me the network wasn&#x27;t available. If I run GUPDATE, it fails with the couldn&#x27;t complete message, in that it knows there is an .msi in waiting type of thing. 
 GP Result shows the policies are being applied to the local endpoint.
 I can give more detail when I am back in the office on specifics. 
 If I plug the laptop into the network (physical cable) the .msi deploys without issue, so i am relatively happy that I set the GPO up correctly. 
 I am not entirely sure RADIUS authentication is set up correctly on the DC, but if I am honest, I am a bit stuck where to look, or more importantly, how to check. 
 I have set the network to wait, and the laptops now take 60secs to boot to a Windows log in screen, but the wifi is disconnected, so it&#x27;s pretty pointless having wait for network in place! 
 As mentioned at the beginning, I have inherited this, and there has been an absolute ton of work required to roll out an RMM to approx 150 laptops, much of which I&#x27;ve had to do via Powershell due to the .msi failing, plus other work to get the estate where it needs to be. This GPO thing has taken a back seat, but it is nagging at me to get it fixed. 
 I could leave it now i have an RMM in place, but I would prefer to fix it and have it working as it should so it doesn&#x27;t bite me in the future. 
 I&#x27;m posting this from home on a public holiday, so don&#x27;t have specific information to hand, but will gladly respond with any info when I am back in the office. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>A candidate who is going to have a software development interview with my organization private messaged me on LinkedIn requesting to ask some few questions from me -i assume its to do with the interview, what to expect, technical environment, tips etc
 I have not responded to him, but I feel this is not right.
 I&#x27;m not part of the interviewing or decision-making panel, and i didn&#x27;t even know about this upcoming interview -but i usually prepare the test computer which will have the practical tests or activities when im told to do so i.e just installing programs, dev environments, user profiles etc
 Should I alert my boss(who is part of the interview), ignore her, or hear what she has to ask
 On the other hand i just wouldn&#x27;t want someone to lose an interview opportunity that could transform their life and that of their loved ones over something like this, i.e. if the candidate gets disqualified before the interview (it&#x27;s just my little caring heart).. Maybe they mean well, or maybe they want to gain an unfair advantage by seeking insider information

 I’m having Sip phones authenticate from the Netherlands, even though I’m in Australia.
 Lots of my users are apparently logging in from the US from their home network, also had a few from khazakstan…
 Any fixes apart from exclusion groups on CA?

                              <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m a tier 3 Sysadmin who has been supporting Windows for 6 years and more recently, Solaris for the last two as my primary OS. I&#x27;m looking at a job right now where I would need to swap from Solaris to Linux as my primary OS as I escape legacy software hell, and I just wanted to ask; has anyone made this swap before that can give me advice?
 I&#x27;m pretty confident with Solaris and do a good amount of bash scripting. What&#x27;s going to be similar between Solaris and Linux? What&#x27;s going to be different? Are there any pitfalls I should look out for or handy courses I should take?
 Thanks in advance!

In the past I would just supply old iPhones and loaner laptops that would be wiped upon return. Wondering if there’s a better way to secure these users while keeping them somewhat productive. What is your go to combo of phone/laptop when traveling to countries like this?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve completed the shift to be 100% cloud and have no need for on-prem AD anymore. We&#x27;ve disabled AD Connect via the Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false command and uninstalled the agent. We also ran Okta sync and uninstalled that agent as well. 
 We have Okta upstream as our profile source and users are federated with that. Everything appears to be operating nominally but AAD still has some remnants of on-prem AD. It shows Password hash sync, Seamless single sign on and pass-through authentication as enabled (this is after 72 hours of running the command). Running a Get-msolcompanyinformation shows the DirSyncService account name and PasswordSynchronizationEnabled as true but DirectorySynchronizationEnabled is set to false.
 Will that change/disappear over time or are there other things that need to be done to remove them?
 Also, does anything officially need to be done with on-prem AD? We are moving offices and have no need for the current network either so things like DNS and networking aren&#x27;t a concern. I think it&#x27;s as simple as shutting down the servers and scrubbing the hard drives but am wondering if there&#x27;s a step or two that&#x27;s missing.

                              <span>Good morning,
 I&#x27;ve been a long time Zabbix user for monitoring. Though I recently discovered an issue with my Zabbix that basically means I need to re-install the whole thing. And that amount of work has made me question if I I should go a paid solution.
 What are people using to monitor servers and networking. And what do you manage.
 I am testing PRTG, and when I did a scan of a VM I started wondering, what do I actually need to check on a VM, is just space of drive and some services enough?
 Cheers.

                              <span>Has anyone worked with UCS? The concept and UCS itself seems fantastic and my test server has been a boarderline perfect experience. But I want to know if there is any catch to this. Anything that should be mentioned for users who are new to UCS?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nagging me, nagging me for years that my local ISP central office could have some random employee who likes to parouse through people&#x27;s activities and happened to pick me. ISPs can store logs forever unless I&#x27;m mistaken.
 Maybe even someone there that knows you, or knows someone you know, and presumably has the ability to locate a person&#x27;s activities. See that they visit certain favorites or habits or wherever.
 Is this realistic in any sense, like for someone who lives in a smaller town? Is anything stopping some random ISP employee from seeing what you do online if they choose? Is it de-aggregated in any way? Or is a VPN truly necessary for all activities, not just special ones...
 I worry that VPNs aren&#x27;t truly secure. You&#x27;re passing the puck to the VPN server host, and even then how do you know your VPN isn&#x27;t leaking or dropping out for a split second? I have never been able to trust in VPNs.

                              <span>I need assistance configuring an Enterprise Wi-Fi setup for a client of mine. This is a scenario I’ve done a few years ago in the past, though it seems newer security settings on Windows don’t make the exact method I used possible, and I’m not even sure if the configuration I’m attempting is possible in a secure manner anymore.
 I have access to 
 NPS on Windows Server
 Unfi Access Points
 Active Directory
 ADCS is set up, computers &amp; users are set to auto enroll certificates. User certificates should be unique and are stored in AD so they will roam from computer to computer.
 Is there a way to have enterprise Wi-Fi set up so that when a domain joined computer boots, it authenticates to the Wi-Fi networking using the machine account (via certificates or any other manner), then when the user logs in, the Wi-Fi then authenticates as the user.
 I’ve been able to get one or the other working, but not both – client needs both because there are computers that do not have a ethernet connection that need to be managed even when users aren’t sitting at them. Ideally this will all be transparent to the user and use their credentials/certificates in the background.
 This needs to work for a user that has never signed on to the machine as well – and ideally I’ll be able to filter the users that are able to access the network (eg WORKSTATION1 always on at the logon screen – Bob can log in to WiFi, but Alex cannot as part of their AD Group Membership)

                              <span>Company decided that 20 people in India are better than 5 people in the US and cut the entire US IT team.
 They gave us a couple months notice to train our Indian replacements which sucks but it is what it is.
 I really like my job, but I’m starting to realize I’ve hit a ceiling and if I want to go beyond basic help desk and basic sysadmin stuff I need to learn more.
 Right now I essentially am a T2 help desk guy, I do manage some more advanced systems but it’s basically the annoying stuff that nobody wants to do (cert renewal and management is the big one).
 If I want to move into a 100% sysadmin role what should I be learning while I have the resources at the last three months on the Job? 
 Any help would be appreciated

                              <span>After months of working as a freelancer, I was able to land a remote Sysadmin job at a reputable (or so I thought 😡) company. 
 One month ends and I am sent a layoff mail and also being told I will compensated 3 months severance pay if I sign a Mutual Separation Agreement which I did. 
 I was actively applying for jobs then I get a call from my former manager one saying that there was a change of mind and my role will be reinstated if I choose to go back to work and also there’s been a reshuffle of the entire IT department and my redundant role will now be under infosec team. 
 I am confused on whether I should get back or just continue looking for a job at a different company? The pay there isn’t bad $65,000/yr.

 Windows Offline files has existed for some time now, but it seems like the feature hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed much of the years and there are of course numerous instances of people commenting on how janky it can be or that recommend to avoid it completely.
 Additionally, documentation on the feature outside of the quintessential use case of employees accessing their files remotely is somewhat sparse, and I&#x27;m somewhat confused if I&#x27;m able to configure it in certain ways as some options seem to rely on AD or the files being hosted on a machine running Windows Server.

                              <span>Hello Sys Admins,
 I&#x27;m a run-of-the-mill shared hosting customer looking for advice: 
 For years, I had Barracuda&#x27;s email gateway security product, sold through my hosting company, and I was always happy with it. Covered all email addresses on all domains, and I could still manage email accounts/forwarders from cPanel with the gateway kind of invisibly in the middle. 
 During the last year, Barracuda bowed out of the small-fry market and my ISP directed me to &quot;professional email services&quot; from titan.email which has not been great at all, and in some respects is absolutely awful (for reasons I&#x27;d be happy to share if anyone cares).
 Anyhoo, are any of you aware of a relatively affordable email gateway security service for someone like me? Between titan and spam assassin, I don&#x27;t seem to have really good choices.
 Thanks in advance...

                              <span>My last few companies have been using google workspace and ive always found it so much easier to manage vs Microsoft 365.
 We use Google Sheets/Docs/Google Meet a lot for our collab and video conferencing but lately we’ve been having a vendor convincing my director to migrate to M365 / One Drive / Teams. 
 I find M365 to be extremely clunky and diffficult to manage. Is it just me or ya’ll feel the same?

 I been transferring client&#x27;s domain from BT to GoDaddy. As a company we have our own WildWest portal with GoDaddy where we usually transfer our other client&#x27;s domains to.
 So it seems that the issue has happened when we gave BT a wrong IPS Tag (to a newly created GoDaddy account rtaher than to our WildWest portal.
 Now it has been almost 60 days and the transfer still has been stuck &quot;in progress&quot;
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Over the last few years I feel like I&#x27;m in a constant battle of having to justify:
 •Why I need to make changes out of hours in a Production environment.
 •Why I can&#x27;t walk out during an Incident to do chores.
 •Why I can&#x27;t give an answer on how long something will take.
 This has only become worse since switching from a hybrid to WFH role, I try explaining it to my family but they have little understanding and the cycle repeats itself.
 Does anyone else find themselves in a similar situation and how do you handle it?

I do hold a Hong Kong permanent resident card and have full working rights in HK, In Australia I have a full working rights visa for 5 years during which I will get the permanent residency. I want to build career in IT and maybe start my own business after like 5-7 years of experience. I came to Sydney as a student in 2017 and did my bachelor of Network security. started working as service desk in 2020 and went back to HK the same year and worked as IT consultant, learned SCCM, PowerShell and a bit of Azure on that role, came back to Sydney a year ago and started working on level 3 support.

                              <span>Traditionally, computing has been deterministic, which refers to the inherent consistency, repeatability, and provability of outcomes in data processing. This is because the output strictly adheres to the programming logic (code written by software developers).
 #LLMs leverage similarity search to process information. During the training phase, LLMs identify similarities among text tokens and create an extensive neural network to capture these patterns. These patterns are then represented in a high-dimensional vector space, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of textual data.
 When processing user input, input sentence is converted into a vector. The OpenAI model then searches for the nearest tokens in the multi-dimensional space, using the shortest distance as a measure of similarity. There is no developers doing the coding to write different logic. Each sentence is following same vector search process.
 Below I show how a sentence is transform into a vector. The model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) in this example is using 768 dimensions. OpenAI has its own API endpoint that do similar processing (text-embedding-ada-002) with 1536 dimensions.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 some info about the systems : its HP,RICOH,Konika Minolta,Lexmark Printers, all of them sitting on the same VLAN dedicated to printers and have static IP address. We use 2016 print server.
 The issue, Printers keep going offline randomly and the only solution to wake them up is to disconnect the network cable and connect it back.
 Lets say out of 12 printers it keeps happening to the same 5-6 printers.
 Now I have disabled SNMP in all of the printers but seems it didn&#x60;t help, they use RAW and port 9100.
 I have checked sleep settings in all of them but you cannot disable it completely.
 We have ALCATEL switches and everything is managed by other company.
 My question is anyone had any experience with this kind of problem?
 maybe the issue is with the configuration on the switch ports since other printers don&#x60;t have those problems?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I was given about 50 IPs, most are Windows servers and some other devices, and need to quickly identify information about those devices, such as what services they are running, who the owner is, etc. Basically do a bit of detective work on them 🙂. Is there a quick way of automating it? I have the AD domain administrator account. I put together a quick powershell script, but I am new to PowerShell and it doesn&#x27;t work as it should. Basically, it should go through the list of IPs, connect and login to each server and export to csv services that are running along with hostname. Can someone recommend either an already made tool for that, or a better script/solution? In case someone asks to check against inventory, or monitoring system, I don’t have access to those (not sure if inven…</span>

 Last time I was here, there was a lot of talk about the death of the &quot;traditional sys admin&quot; and how everything could be infrastructure as code soon.
 It also seemed that many were predicting the death of the data center and &quot;everything&quot; would be SaaS and/or AWS based soon.
 So I am curious:
 1) Is the traditional sys admin role dead?
 2) Is the physical data center dead?
 3) Did the infrastructure as code revolution actually happen?

 But long story short I traced the ports and wires to the location on the com closet and all of the wires are aggregated to a punch down block? Then they go to some grey wire that looks one of those old db25 cables 
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out what this cable is for.

                              <span>i am looking for 10g cisco switch 16-24 ports for enterprise use, i was advised to go for CBS350 but they are for small businesses, i dont have any previous experience or how reliable they are or their lifespan. cisco website suggests enterprise datacenter grade switch but they are expensive ?
 also what happend if i went for something currently not supported like SG550x??

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m recently started learning about datagrams and IP header and I&#x27;m confused for now. To be specific, If we&#x27;re sending datagram without fragmentation, I wanted to ask in which fields router is going to change their contents?
 I know that (I would post a picture of ip header but I can&#x27;t) IP header constists vers, hlen, type of service, total length, ident, flags, fragment offset, ttl, type, header checksum, source IP address, destination IP address, IP options, padding and beginning of payload (data). So again, speaking of regular datagram sending without fragmentation, in which fields the content will be changed?
 ​
 Also, what is the difference if we would do that with fragmentation?

                              <span>So I got this small bit of &quot;what&#x27;s best way to implement this&quot; for a small business.
 There&#x27;s 3 WAN uplinks, from different providers - main one&#x27;s fiber, second&#x27;s through a point to point wifi high speed link and 3rd one is a last resort SIM modem with static IPv4.
 There&#x27;s no ISP support to run a dynamic protocol on either of the 3.
 R1 must dial a PPPoE connection with auth, then receive static IPv4 on pppoe1 interface. Same for R2. Both can also get a /48 IPv6, but that&#x27;s for another time. R3 has a static IPv4.
 Magic question here being: what dynamic protocol could be used between each of the 3 &quot;R&quot; edge routers and FW1 so that:- 0.0.0.0/0 is redistributed, but removed from advertisements should the PPPoE link fail- order priority remains the same (traffic flows through R1, should that fail, through R2 or - finally - through R3 as last resort)
 Initially thinking running IBGP between FW1 and each R router, but with a default originate, the session will always put 0.0.0.0/0 in the session no matter if the link is up or down, or with a &quot;redistribute connected route-map X&quot;, with route-map X permitting just interface pppoe1, but I&#x27;m pretty sure such advertisement won&#x27;t include the 0.0.0.0/0 in it.
 Any other alternatives/protocols just for the default route ?
 From a vendor perspective, all items involved - R1,R2,R3,FW1 - are Linux machines (VMs with NICs in passthrough mode), so any dynamic protocol supported by FRRouting is a go.

                              <span>We currently use a mix of Catalyst switches, most 3850s (and some 9300s and some older switches).
 We have about 200 access switches in total in the environment. We are looking at replacing about 150 of them in the next 2 years.
 One of my team members wants to go full Meraki. We already use their APs and their MX firewalls. 
 I and others on the team are resultant as we sometimes have needed more advanced policy-based routing and such on the Catalysts. On the other hand, we have a mish-mash of versions, routes, etc across the environment. 
 Would a full investment in Meraki make sense, or are we tying our own hands?

                              <span>Greetings:
 My company previously rented a Meraki from an MSP that managed our switches. When we went with a new MSP, they advised we purchase a Fortigate 80E. However, in so doing, we lost the ability to manage our switches without factory restoring them (the first MSP took their secrets with them). The next MSP that sold us the Fortigate always said they would get around to restoring our Cisco switches but ... well, they are out ex-MSPs for a reason.
 So, our company decides to move everything internal. Updating the network is my job. Our physical footprint is shrinking so we have some extra switches. I restore a Cisco SG300 to factory, patch/upgrade it move it into production as a replacement for an in-production, unpatched Cisco SG300 (like-for-like). 
 The Fortigate was config&#x27;d to do all the heavy lifting. It does all the routing, hands out IP leases, etc. 
 So here is the problem. The updated/patched Cisco is installed and up and running. Switching like a champ except it is not appearing at all in the Fortigate ARP table. Further still, the Fortigate keeps giving it an IP address that has already been assigned from the DHCP pool. When I attempt to take DHCP out the equation and assign the Cisco a static IP by MAC address it does not work because the Fortigate never gives an indication it sees the switch (no entry in the DHCP table, no entry in the ARP table). 
 I suspect there must be something misconfigured on the Switch but I can&#x27;t access the gui without a reliable IP address. I can access via console but I am not physically there until monday.
 So, in the interim, any ideas? I am sure its something simple I am missing but sometimes the simplest thing is the easiest thing to overlook.
 Thank you!
 EDIT: I’ll add that the web gui on Cisco was verified as working and it received a unique IP when it was not connected directly to the Fortigate.

 This post got away from me so TL;DR version: SysAdmin at new company. Office 2016. Not hybrid as told. MSP in Germany 100% controls and manages on prem AD, print server, network management, security and software/hardware deployment. I don’t even have Read type access to any of that. Expected to nickle &amp; dime my time with manual clock punches. Future M365/Azure AD plans call for migration to NEW MSP to handle all aspects of it. Prev MSP will still do the rest. Told there is no real structured help desk. This isn’t normal right? 
 To start, I can’t 100% put the blame on this company or the people involved in my hiring process. I didn’t ask the right questions and was too nonchalant about the whole thing. I was looking for a change and this was one of those late …</span>

                              <span>Hey gang, I have ended up wearing the IT hat in our small business (10-20 employees) and have a question as we&#x27;ve run into a bit of an expansion/growth problem :)
 We have a program we need to run to manage our projects which runs on windows and only within the LAN. This is great except a large percentage of our staff use Macs and work outside of the office (don&#x27;t ask!). Our current solutions is to have a bunch of desktop PCs running Splashtop (similar to TeamViewer) within the office so people on macs/working remotely can splashtop in and run the application.
 While the Mac users can boot-up a VM and run the tool via VPN we find that process is way too slow compared to just jumping on a Splashtop machine and opening the app (and requires them to be able to set up and manage a VM+VPN).
 This works ok but we&#x27;re finding it&#x27;s clearly not scalable or efficient.
 ​
 Does anyone know if MS/someone else offers a terminal server product that would be able to host multiple remote connections and instances of the same application at once? Alternatively is there a recommended method for having a server run say 6 VMs each with their own Splashtop instance? I imagine this clearly requires a special MS license? Is there a way to do this with Azure so we can scale it up and down?

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;m looking for a little help finding some settings. It looks like our RMM software has locked updates on our servers, which our infra admin found out when he went to patch today. The same settings have been in place on our workstations, and I was able to find the settings enumerated in the updates menu there. I just can&#x27;t find them in local gpo or the registry.
 I&#x27;m not sure I can post the screenshot of the settings, so I&#x27;ll just type them out here:
 Disable automatic updates Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Get updates for other Microsoft products Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable check for updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable Pause updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Set Automatic Update options Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy 
 Everything in local GPO under Templates\Components\Updates is set to not configured. A few articles online advise going through and turning on all the Windows 10 Telemetry settings, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the fix here. Thanks in advance.
 Edit: screenshot in the first comment.

But for crying out loud we have a balcony, hell take the disabled toilets if you really have to but the network cabinet’s ventilation is not as good as most people think it is (lost count how many times I’ve complained to facilities about that). Depending on where you release, the smell can linger and mature. I had to show one of the AT&amp;T engineers to the networking cabinet in Friday and the smell was so bad I had to apologise and keep the door open for a good 10 mins before he was comfortable enough to work. 
 The worst thing is that this is not the first time this has happened, it’s the 3rd!!!!. I swear to God I only have 2 months left in this hell hole but I’m going to make it my life’s mission to find out who the serial cabinet farter is if it’s the last thing I do. Even if I have to suspend everyone’s security badge, I do not get paid enough to write an email to my staff on a Tuesday to reserve farting at a better more considerate place, can’t imagine how that’s going to go down.

                              <span>We have used MSPs at our business (75 employees) since before I started here 12 years ago. I manage everything on the backend (NAS, VOIP, door access, etc), but I don’t have time to keep up with the workstations so it works. The MSP provides a security package for the users, handle printers, updates, and a few other odds and ends. We switched MSPs last year because of some interpersonal conflicts and the new company looked great. They had a nice portfolio, interviewed well, tickled my ears with a solid “we know this is your network we’re here to help”, AND they specialized in our business type. Part of their contract outside of their maintenance agreement was an AP upgrade for the building. They sold us on a UniFi system and we deployed. A few days go by and I start noticing some weird dropouts in a few different places so I put in a ticket for them to check the auto-negotiation of channels and see if the UDM recommended any changes, etc. crickets Two days later I follow up with an email crickets 3 days later I email the account manager and reply was “I don’t see anything on our end, if you have a minute can you log in and see what you see?” I let him know that a login wasn’t created for me yet, but I’d be happy to. I get the invite, accept, and my jaw hits the floor. The manager had given me access to every one of his accounts, with full admin, AND access to their other customer’s financial backups that they vaulted for them. Needless to say that was our last week retaining that company.

                              <span>My company is going to replace a couple dozen laptops and we have a policy to destroy the hard drives because of the potential privacy/security ramifications. I’m wondering if it’s worth donating the machines despite not being in ‘working order’ or if having them recycled would be better. Anyone have experience going down either path? The machines are like 4-5 years old and decent quality for that age of machine so still lots of life left in them.

                              <span>Hey there, former sysadmin turned pentester here. Recently, in almost every environment, I&#x27;ve been able to privesc from a regular user to Domain Admin using AD CS vulnerabilities.
 I definitely recommend running Certipy or Certify (compiled binary) to see if you can identify any vulnerabilities in your environment. As far as I know, this stuff won&#x27;t come up on a Nessus scan. I know when I was a sysadmin I set this up insecurely (has now been fixed). However, AD CS is easy to set up without knowing some of the security implications of the configurations.
 The guys over at Spectorops who came out with their paper on attacking AD CS (Certified pre-owned) also have a good talk on &quot;ReCertifying Active Directory Certificate Services&quot;.
 Edit: I linked both Certify and Certipy earlier. Certify is a windows application. Certipy is based on python. I prefer certipy. If you want to run certipy it’s pretty easy. One way is to setup a Kali VM. Download that here. 
 Then next through the Kali install. If it pulls dns and up from DHCP you should be good to go. After you’re in, open up a command prompt and type 
 pip3 install certipy-ad 
 Then run
 certipy find -vulnerable -stdout -u lowprivuser@domain.local -p password

 For comparison, computer monitors in a work environment get replaced every 3-4 years.
 How long have you had your current computer monitor and have you had any which lasted more than 5 or even 10 years?

 Since the computer locks on sleep, my plan B is just to set the monitor and computer sleep timeouts to the same values, but out of curiosity I&#x27;d like to know if this is possible first.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 With all the recent redundancies which have been going on I’m one of those who have been affected. At the risk of disclosing too much I’m in a management position but don’t have much technical skills anymore and was hoping for some general career advice and CV writing tips. Im pretty much getting butchered in a lot of interviews because I’ve “lost touch” with tech in general :(. 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
 Edit:happy to send my CV across via chat, I’m mainly playing this carefully because of my NDA

 Anyone have had issues with the use of Pin codes?

                              <span>Hi, right now I am unable to login (locally) on my Win10 workstation. I see the &quot;spinning circle&quot; but it definitely hanged.
 I have OpenSSH server installed on my workstation, so I&#x27;d like to try solving the problem without rebooting (which will definitely works!)
 I just killed all my Firefox&#x27;s processes with taskkill, shutdown a couple of Virtualbox VM machines (which were running totally fine!).
 I just noticed that tasklist is unable to complete, it stops at
 ​
 System Idle Process System Registry smss.exe csrss.exe 
 Powershell Get-Process is working fine (it shows all processes).
 If it happened to you, how would you approach it?
 Forgot to mention: I am also unable to login through RDP

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I&#x27;ve seen a lot of talk about veeam here and have taken the plunge into testing it out. I&#x27;ve started getting everything set up and will test backups further down the road but thought I&#x27;d ask y&#x27;all first before spending too much time. 
 I&#x27;m looking to backup Azure vms running MSSQL, and those servers have separate managed disks containing the MDF, LDF, and daily backups. Would veeam for azure also backup those managed disks or is it just going to grab the vm and it&#x27;s OS drive?

                              <span>So in the past I&#x27;ve mostly developed custom solutions using SharePoint with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, as well as calling the SharePoint API. 
 I&#x27;m consulting for a company and so far I&#x27;ve talked only to the non-technical guys. The non-technical guys told me that their in house engineering team &#x27;overcomplicated&#x27; the process by adding a lot of if/else conditions, etc. The engineering team hasn&#x27;t written any documentation, so I&#x27;m not inclined to believe that the process that they came up with is the most clear and easy to follow. At the same time, if the process was super simple (setting up a SharePoint form, automating tasks with Power Automate and Power Automate), then the non-technical team could have just used the drag and drop interface and do it themselves. It&#x27;s sort of a typical issue where the non-engineers don&#x27;t understand exactly what needs to be done on the technical side, so they think the issue is way more simple than it actually is. 
 I&#x27;ve been asked to come up with a recommendation for the best path moving forward and I&#x27;m not super sure what to suggest. I&#x27;m leaning towards starting from scratch, writing custom JavaScript when needed, and then of course, writing clear and easy to use documentation. 
 Part of me wonders though if the hardest part of this whole workflow is simply working through all these very domain specific edge cases. I can foresee issues down the line where the people giving the directions / exec team doesn&#x27;t have a good understanding of their current systems, yet they&#x27;ll still want a very specific result. 
 I guess my question is what to &#x27;recommend&#x27; for next best steps that gives the exec team confidence in my recommendations, and also reduces the headache / back and forth nitpicking that I am anticipating with the exec team?

Enterprise support downgraded to basic support. Start pushing &quot;Enterprise Plus&quot; support plus for advanced support.
 New feature sets that provides marginal improvements to Security, UX, Workflow, etc... Now an Add On, on top of your Enterprise License.
 We let go your dedicated CSM and triple you up with another CSM. This CSM comes in doesn&#x27;t know much, doesn&#x27;t keep promises of the old CSM, and pushes twice as hard for add on services.
 Your assigned enterprise technical architect that provided you recommendations and project work, he/she is too busy right now. Your CSM schedules him/her 2 weeks from now because of increase in workload AND reduce the hours available. (Before it used to be a few days, and as many hours as you reasonably need). THEN THEY TRY TO SELL YOU EXPERT TECHNICAL ARCHITECT SERVICE TO FILL THE GAP.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a thinclient for production environment. It will run just a browser to connect to our erp, so I need very basic specs (Ram 4 GB, Disk 8/16 GB, ethernet connection, fanless). OS is not required, as I will install a a light linux distribution (porteus).
 Can you suggest some cheap models available in Europe?
 Edit : added details about OS I will install

                              <span>We have a new building going up (and other building works) at work which means new fibre being installed and existing fibre being cut and spliced.
 Looking at getting some basic fibre fault finding/troubleshooting tools to help with (just had this happen this week) &quot;the fault is with your equipment&quot; after fibre cutting and splicing has been done and said network was working right up until the point of the new joins being terminated into the comms rack.
 Anyway, looking at the Fluke (totally open to other options) FiberLert and VisiFault and if I should get both or just one or even something else totally.
 What I *think* we need is just a basic visual fault finder that shoots a light down a link but would like to hear from others what they recommend that onsite teams have/use for fault finding/troubleshooting before calling in professions.

I&#x27;ve spent a ton of time researching and configuring, but this is far beyond my self-taught knowledge. I&#x27;d appreciate having a more skilled set of eyes look over what I&#x27;ve configured. Priorities are uptime and reliability. There are 10-12 staff on-site at a time and 10-15 patients. The site is about 2000 sqft. The owner isn&#x27;t fond of monthly fees or lengthy contracts, so I have to have reasonable justifications for those, but he is willing to spend on capital purchases.

 Whats you opinion on this?

 I have 4 routers in the lab. R1 is Cisco and R2, R3 and R4 are Juniper. The topology is basically 
 R1&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R2&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R3&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R4
 I have configured VLAN 2 on an SVI on the Juniper and Cisco switches, with trunk links between them. I can ping all the way from R1 to R4 with no problem. 
 Routers 2, 3 and 4 all have adjacencies to each other. R1 only has an adjacency to R2 but &#x60;show isis neighbors&#x27; shows R3 and R4 as being in the INIT stage. I&#x27;ve checked the MTU, even changed it and I&#x27;m getting the same behavior. I&#x27;ve put my configs below, and I&#x27;m hoping the experts here can point me in the right direction, what am I missing here?

 Here’s the quick version of what went down. He was Help Desk admin, so he had some admin-level credentials and access to a fair few systems with risk and trust involved. One day, last week, he had a user reach out to him after-hours, needing admin credentialed approval for a software update on their laptop. Now, either out of sheer laziness, lapse in all judgment, or a weird crush he had on this user, he decided that rather than remote into the user’s laptop, type his creds in to get the update pushed through, and call it a day… he simply gave the employee his admin-level username and password over a Teams chat message.
 To say this irritated me when I…</span>

 Amazon Bussness has a form where you can provide details of a project and they will give you a custom quote on huge quantity of something.
 I can&#x27;t remember what the minimum is for a large quantity quote but I think it is truly meant for large enterprise rollouts. For example: 10000 Sticks of 16gb ddr4 ram or 10000 iPad cases.
 (Also open to other suggestions of of a good vendor to buy a large quantity of ram from and suggestions on the best brands.)

 While replacing his power strip I see one of the plugs is electrical taped. Yup, someone, maybe him, bought a power adapter from goodwill for $1.99. One side of the electrical cord had broken at the strain relief so the genius had electrical taped it so that it mostly made contact. It was the power cord for the monitor’s power brick, so I can only imagine when it would lift, power would get pulled through the hdmi cable and, zap! He’d get a shock. 
 I don’t know why this monitor has a goodwill power adapter?? People will “solve” their own problems in fantastically stupid ways.

That they &quot;believed&quot; they had a responsibility to ensure user choices were respected? That they &quot;understood it was important&quot; that they lead by example with their own first party Microsoft products?
 Well...
  
Web links [...] in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge. [...] A similar experience will arrive in Teams.
 Links will open in Microsoft Edge even if it is not the system default browser in Windows.
  
Because fuck respecting user choices and leading by example. Gotta continue pushing Edge no matter what.

                              <span>My company purchased a building recently, and inherited a Honeywell access control system. The company we purchased it from had a ProWatch server that is now disconnected. Until we can decide on new floor plans/layouts and then rip and replace the access control system, we&#x27;re currently stuck with the badges that we got from the old tenant. 
 We&#x27;re running out of badges at this point, and I was hoping to be able to get connected to these controllers and add/change some badges. It&#x27;s not a pressing matter yet because very few people have moved in, but as we start doing construction and the like it&#x27;s going to get complicated. 
 We&#x27;d really rather not pay Honeywell for their ProWatch software only to replace it 6 months down the line. Anyone have any experience working with these systems outside of the way Honeywell intended? If we&#x27;re stuck then we&#x27;re stuck and we&#x27;ll deal with it. Just looking for options.
 Failing this I may just get a badge cloner and some re-writables.

                              <span>Hello, Our department recently was given a couple free racks. However, we use vertical mount PDUs. This picture here shows how they attach, with the kind of &#x27;hook on PDU slots downward with weight/gravity into hole in rack&#x27; - I don&#x27;t know what this mounting connection is called, if it does have a formal name.
 Unfortunately, the new freebie racks don&#x27;t have this socket-for-a-hook that our existing racks, APC units, have. Instead they have these odd square holes surrounded by small circular holes. Problem: I also don&#x27;t know what this is called so my Google-Fu is lacking.
 I know that attachments like this exist where you consume 1U or 2U to add horizontally-jutting out attachments which adds these sockets, but I&#x27;ve worked with those before and they really take up a lot of space in a rack that I&#x27;d rather be using for network cables (gone are the days of one cable per physical host, hah). Also we put our Cisco switches at the top of our racks, exactly where these horizontal add-ons would go.
 So instead I&#x27;m wondering if any of you know of an item that can attach into those square holes in my picture, to add a round socket so I can hang my vertical PDUs. Or even just the terminology, so I can at least do more effective searches.

                              <span>I emailed my former CEO the other day to inform him that they still have a public facing Exchange 2010 OWA server running on Server 2008R2. I explained how dangerous this is, as I did multiple times prior to quitting a year and a half ago. I am friends with several people there still and I hate to see such a vulnerability in the wild that could affect them.
 Do I just drop it?

                              <span>I manage a service that uses Cloudflare to protect services for about 300 customers. Not a big fish, but big enough to spend a few thousand $ per month and have a dedicated customer success rep. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the new team that was assigned to me, and I wonder if it&#x27;s a widespread issue, or just the luck of the draw.
 Recently, a lot has changed at Cloudflare:
  
They reorganized things to downgrade their baseline enterprise support, and make you pay for the &quot;premium&quot; level that used to be the baseline. That&#x27;s fine- I don&#x27;t need that much support. And I was honestly surprised at how much handholding they gave me before.
 The Customer Success team turned over a few times before I could even meet them. Again, that&#x27;s fine, and understandable if Cloudflare is shaking things up.

                              <span>Wanted to post this as a heads up, in case anyone else stumbles across it.
 The issue is that USB audio devices with microphones attached directly to the laptop will show that no microphone input is available. If you are looking at the old Sound control panel, you will see the microphone entry but no level meter off to the right.
 The fix was to rollback the driver to the previous version, in our case .6815 version.

                              <span>Cyber security is tough. Patching, incidents, email spam among my other sys admin duties. Today i was forwarded an email by account asking if the email was legit. It had made it pas all our safeguards, looked legit but the person in accounting noticed the from email did not match the normal sender. 
 While picking the email apart it was indeed a spoofed email with a .PDF malware attachment. Caught by a keen eye, the security training we&#x27;ve done and the test emails are working! 
 Anyway through my dissection of the email i was able to track it back to the company that owned the domain and found that it was a compromised O365 account. It was a doctors office in NYC about 90 minutes from our location. 
 I thought &quot;Great i got their contact info let me just give them a heads up to have their IT look into the issue.&quot; Let me tell you this did not go at all how i had hopped it would. 
 I called their office and asked to speak with the Doctor running the practice or the office manager. After a moment on hold i got to speak with the office manager. I explained who i was, what company i was with and relayed my contact info should they need to follow up. I then explained that we received an email from their O365 portal and that one of their accounts or possibly their whole O365 account was potentially compromised and they should speak with their IT team to investigate. 
 I don&#x27;t know if i sent this poor persons brain into overload or what but as soon as i finished talking they started to berate me like i was somehow the person that compromised their systems. I didn&#x27;t want any recognition i just wanted to do the right thing and let them know of the possible breach. But instead all i got was about 3 minutes of angry Karren before they simply hung up. 
 Any one else come across something similar? Try to do the right thing by letting someone know only for it to fall on deaf ears or worse?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious as to the community&#x27;s thoughts on this.
 Our helpdesk is regularly inundated with tickets about Excel, usually along the lines of &#x27;Excel is freezing or crashing&#x27;. It&#x27;s almost every case, it can be narrowed down to a few standard culprits:
  
3rd Party Add-in (for us it&#x27;s an add-in that pulls data from our ERP - Dynamics or JDE)
 Spreadsheets linked to 30 other spreadsheets, of which half the links are usually broken
 Macro or VB issues
 Some frankenstein spreadsheet with quarter-end balance info that&#x27;s been in use since 1997.
  
Our finance team gets frustrated because they always come running to IT, but realistically there&#x27;s little we can do, because 95% of the time it&#x27;s not really an actual PC or app problem. We endlessly communicate this, but of course people come to see us regardless.
 We&#x27;re thinking of implementing a policy of not being able to support Excel.
 Curious how you all handle &#x27;those excel issues&#x27;.

                              <span>I remember back in the day it was a big deal to make company wide changes. At what point did Microsoft decide they were in control and know what&#x27;s best for our companies?
 Case in point: They release &quot;Roaming Signatures&quot; and push it out, without asking, and without warning.
 So now I&#x27;m creating a company wide GPO to disable it because its completely borked our signature systems, and in our field our email signatures are extremely important.
 I find myself more and more often having to setup stuff to block things MS has just decided to push out.

                              <span>I have one windows 11 device that will not allow me to connect to it using RDP unless I set the security layer to RDP. 
 The specific error I get when it’s set to negotiate or SSL is “Server message: AADSTS293004: This target-device identifier in the request “name-pc” was not found in the tenant “our tenant ID””
 When looking at the RDP logs I see where TCP read and write fail. And after setting the security layer to RDP, I connect directly to the device but am at the computer login screen VS the window that usually pops up authenticating me to AzureAD before allowing any access to the PC. 
 I’ve wiped the PC to no avail. Any ideas what I can do to further troubleshoot or remediate the problem?

                              <span>Having a debate with coworkers about Specops settings. We can ban dictionary words, but also set a minimum length for a passphrase. My assumption is that when the policy sees &quot;Chocolate14$&quot; it contains a dictionary word, and is not allowed, but if it sees &quot;Ilikechocolatecake365!&quot; then it sees it as a phrase. My coworkers contend that the presence of any dictionary word means the password is non-compliant, so the passphrase setting is conflicting and useless.

 Here, I&#x27;ll take you through my journey with Morgan Stanley, discussing two different interviews:
 1️⃣ After completing my Master&#x27;s in Computer Science, I interviewed for a Junior Developer position when they visited our university for campus placements.
 2️⃣ A few years later, with 3+ years of experience at the Royal Bank of Canada, I applied for a Senior Developer position through LinkedIn.

 I feel like disclosing my ADHD/ASD is a problem and instead of being asked to give my side of things and the benefit of the doubt, it&#x27;s easier for family, friends and colleagues, etc to make assumptions. 
 I have been told I have behavioural and communication issues and at school I got bullied for being different.
 A usual trend is or was people usually start conversations with &quot;a couple/few people have mentioned/ told/ brought to my attention...&quot;
 When I&#x27;ve tried to explain myself or seek clarity they&#x27;ve assumed I&#x27;m trying stuff on.

                              <span>Hey everyone. There is a Dell Precision tower that has ubuntu loaded on it and is used by our developers. Someone tried updating cuda and it basically caused the SSD to not boot to the OS. A ton of error messages appeared. To make a long story short, I went into recovery mode, removed all NVIDIA drivers, cleaned it and booted to the OS with no problem. Once we rebooted the machine again, it reverted back to the previous state of not booting to the OS and now I&#x27;m not able to get to the recovery mode. I ran a ton of commands and can&#x27;t get to recovery mode or to the login screen. So what I did was imaged another SSD and removed the old one. 
 My question is, is there a way for me to get the data off of the old SSD and load it onto the newer SSD? There are a few very specific files they&#x27;re wanting off of the old SSD, which will save them time in recreating everything from scratch. ORR would it be ok to connect the old SSD as a secondary drive and they get to the files from there while the tower boots to the newer SSD??? I&#x27;m just trying to figure out the best way to go about this and I&#x27;m by far not great with Ubuntu; it&#x27;s too sensitive..lol. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone, you&#x27;re my (pretty much) last resort as I am looking for a solution to this problem for quite some time now.
 Our small non-profit currently does not have dedicated E-Mail adresses, our members use their own (personal) E-Mail adresses (gmail, yahoo, you name it). I&#x27;ve set up some forwarding e-mails, e.g. finances@ourdomain.com to the personal adresses of our members. This is not the best solution since every position is occupied with at least two persons and everyone gets a copy of the E-Mail. In total we are talking about around 10-14 people/users and a total of around 6 shared inboxes.
 The next step was looking for an MS Exchange with shared inboxes and automapping to outlook. We cannot use the official O365 due to GDPR restrictions of our governing body and would have to use an on-premise solution. Microsoft does not allow for shared inboxes on mobile devices under on-premise hosting. All the available workarounds I found online (enabling insecure IMAP connections, enabling the deactivated user in the Exchange panel) are not allowed by either the hosting company or violate Microsoft licensing terms.
 So the next thought was several IMAP accounts. No usually as an admin, I&#x27;d have to give the shared account credentials to everyone involved. I stumbled upon the Nextcloud Mail App which allows for multiple mail accounts, maybe that&#x27;s a solution. I&#x27;ve already posted this idea in the /r/Nextcloud subreddit.
 Do you have an idea concerning this matter? All in all, I want several users to connect to the same mailbox via their personal PCs (they use Outlook there) and their mobile devices (they either use a Mail App of their choice or I could talk them into using a separate app if neccessary).
 I&#x27;m really at loss here, hoping to get some ideas :)

                              <span>Over the past few weeks we have noticed odd behaviour with MS more specifically EXO. Our latest complaint is safe emails are now all of the sudden going into quarantine. We are a mortgage company and our users do business with many 3rd parties. Emails were flowing with out issue up until recently. Communication between our users and external 3parties starts out as it should, then for some reason the detection methods go crazy and quarantines the emails. Its becoming a headache to monitor the quarantine, release and report/submit false positives to MS. In the past 30 days we have submitted over 500 emails as false positives. On the MS doc for Secure by Default, it states that this cannot be turned off by admins. And the percentage rate is low for false positives. I dis believe this as we are seeing a high impact. I have done some tweaking by adding these domains to safe senders list but this has little resolve as some of the messages are marked as High Conf Phish. While reviewing the report in quarantine for these emails nothing is being marked as a threat - attachments, urls or images . All pass. No campaign or other indicators except for &quot;Advanced Filter technology&quot;. I have turned off &quot;mailbox intelligence&quot; in the filters but that has done nothing. I have opened a ticket with MS and its going no where fast. I have even shared the article they have published on Secure by Default and highlighted that part where it states safe emails are being marked as phishing. Anyone else experiencing this headache?

 I&#x27;m in charge of my first power down for all our systems today, usually there are a couple of us taking care of these, this is the first time I&#x27;ll need to down the MSAs. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve lost my Googling skills, but I realised I don&#x27;t have any GUI for the MSA, so how do I turn them off?
 I can&#x27;t find an answer anywhere and the manager is unavailable for contact.
 We have x1 2040 and x1 2060.
 The only reference says just hold the power buttons down, but that can&#x27;t be right?

 We have an AD user that is not a member of Domain Admins group anymore but he is still able to log-in into domain controllers and add other users to the group Domain Admins within a tool &#x27;Active Directory Users and Computers&quot;. User doesn&#x27;t have local admin permission on domain controller.
 We&#x27;ve tested this scenario on brand new user but without successful reproduction.
 Delegate Control is saying that user doesn&#x27;t have permissions &quot;Write members&quot; on Domain Admin Groups.
 Have any of you been struggling with such case? Where we need to start looking?

 I live in Iran and there are severe inte4rnet restrictions here so we all need to use VPNs for our daily usage,
 We cannot use TOR or any subscription based VPN that is operating outside of Iran, so we need to setup our own VPNs.
 I Need to buy a VPS and run WireGuard on it so I can create VPN profiles on it and onwards I will distribute these profiles among people.
 I need help choosing a provider that is reliable enough for using them as a VPN, I cannot spend a lot of money on this VPS so please keep the suggestions to the budget category.
 I am sorry if there are any Grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language.
 and I need minor help regarding the specs of the said VPS I haven&#x27;t fully understood how strong of a VPS I would need to purchase.
 Thanks guys

                              <span>For context - I am a Linux guy. However, my brother owns a small manufacturing business that uses Windows tablets on the shop floor. As you can imagine, in that environment, the average lifetime of a tablet is not great. The other gotcha is that I am remote and have been setting these tablets up for him remotely - He connects them to the shop floor wifi, I do the rest.
 So what I&#x27;m looking for is some software (Free, paid, whatever) so that I can create a master image from one of these freshly set up tablets and then either write that to USB or maybe deploy via PXE (Not sure if the tablets can even have their boot order changed, so that may not be possible). If there is some software that can create a &quot;Plug in the usb stick and walk away&quot; image, that would be best as he&#x27;s highly non-technical.
 Thanks in advance!

 should i take the switch (and make my life around my career). or should i stay and do something on the side (im thinking about indie game dev) and if u can tell me about anything good to do on the side to get me a hobby that pays that would be great. and thanks.

Most of them are in unknown state and I need to perform some diagnostic and reporting on it. I imagine something like setting up some network boot environment as I have enough space for connecting some 20-40 laptops at once and boot them up. After performing the diagnostics I should have a saved report somewhere. Also if there is an option for wiping the laptop would be a big plus. As always, if it&#x27;s open source, it would be better.
 I don&#x27;t seem to be able to find anything useful and I would appreciate your input on this. Thanks!

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t find any better place than this if it&#x27;s ok?
 So i have some drives encrypted with truecrypt. Haven&#x27;t uses the drives for a couple of months, but have the password written down somewhere
 I connected the drives to my windows 10 pc
 Tried login in with password... says it it&#x27;s wrong
 Started to look for some information, some are saying, when this is happening, the partition could be damage
 After a while of thinking, i tried something i did not find, my partitions does not have any letters, but can been seen in any partition program, my solution to get truecrypt accept my password was following
  
Open diskmanagment
 Selectet your hidden drives and add letters to the drives
 Then a pop up windows says the drive needs to be formatting, ignore that, close down pop up window
  Remove the letters you added to your hidden drives
  Now you should be able access your hidden drives through truecrypt
  
At least my drives wasen&#x27;t damaged
 But why did true crypt not find my hidden partitions in the first place? It did months before?

                              <span>So in 25ish years in IT I&#x27;ve always worked places that bought their desktops outright and I&#x27;ve had zero experience with leasing equipment. Yesterday I was chatting with a friend whose company just signed an agreement to lease 300+ desktops for 3 years and he shared that the agreement stipulated they had to return the equipment in the original boxes at the end of the lease. It still blows my mind a little and I&#x27;ve been processing it for almost 24 hours.
 Is this kind of requirement a normal thing in equipment lease agreements? If so, is it something vendors actually enforce? If so, how in the hell do companies store hundreds or thousands of boxes with packing materials for years? It sounds wildly impractical to deal with this.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 Do you have any tips what to check when one users Mac prints in isolation mode?
 ​
 The setup is that we have a print server setup and printer driver is installed locally there, we add the printer in Mac by adding it as Windows printer via spools. We have added it the same way on other computers and it works fine but for one user it won&#x27;t work.

 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been discussing this with Mimecast themselves and they keep redirecting us to the Blocked Sender and DNS Authentication policies.
 What we are trying to determine if possible is, can we configure Mimecast in such a way that it would choose to honour a DMARC policy that has hold or reject configured, but have it ignore any policy with a none option set and then apply our own override?
 I can appreciate the issues this is going to potentially cause with valid business email being blocked as not everyone has DMARC correctly configured (hell, our sister companies don&#x27;t!), but we are looking at this as purely a technical discussion right now. Mimecast&#x27;s solution is to have manual intervention and have us manage the blocked senders list by adding domains in response to events such as a phishing attack. That&#x27;s not a valid solution for us. We are discussing and looking for a purely automated solution here.

                              <span>Hi
 I built DATA CENTER with central DC&#x27;s VM that holds the DNS services and the RDS license services, and under it, I made all the VM&#x27;s with Tree Trusted Domain (with realm Trust Type). Each VM gets its RDS license from the DC directly (through GPO redirect to the RDS license server&#x27;s IP); sometimes, the VM drop from the RDS license server; I should enter the Remote Desktop Licensing Diagnoser, renew the connection to the RDS license server, and resupply the credentials!
 How can I reserve the connection to the RDS server? Is there any other method that can resolve my issue?
 Do I have to add a universal group with RDSadmins that can cross the trusted forest, and which appropriate&#x27;s group should it be in the DC server?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys,
 So we are using Aurora MySQL for our production.
 Once in a while, we need to manually do some data manipulations in the database. In these cases, one of the approved senior engineers who has privilege log in to a production container and run the queries required. Users who log in to the production environment are logged and recorded, however, there is no record of what they did. Maybe they did some data manipulation or maybe not. But there is no way to know it.
 How do you guys record these? Or what is the best practice for cases when manual data manipulation is required?
 Cheers.

                              <span>I’m extremely frustrated , please excuse my rant. I joined IT pretty late in my life, was 29 when I landed my first Helpdesk gig, 1.5 years later got headhunted by Microsoft to join their Helpdesk, made it to manager in 3 years from agent to supervisor then manager and yesterday got served my 3 month notice for redundancy. I’m based in the UK and I’m seriously disappointed. My comanager was barely around (constantly disappearing, never showing up to the office to look after his kids, taking weeks of sick leave) so I had to pick up on his slack and do the work of 2 full time managers. Even though we report to the same manager, I complained about him several times but my manager said there’s nothing she could do thanks to employee rights. Me being me, I constantly worked 10 hours a day as well as evenings, weekends, took my work laptop with me while I was on vacation to Spain and Cyprus. People see my success and obsessive nature but I sacrificed a lot, my girlfriend left me, I’m the fattest I’ve ever been, my cholesterol levels are through the roof and I’ve developed extremely painful haemorrhoids to where I almost passed out from the pain in the office bathroom. I get out of breath when tying my shoe lace! Now on top of everything I’ve been made redundant. 
 I don’t have anything left in the tank to do anything more, I bombed my last interview as a manager for a fintech company and with only 1 years managerial experience it’s doubtful I’ll get another manager gig. So by the end of all this I’ve ended up a sad fat lonely burnt out idiot who sacrificed literally everything to get to absolutely nowhere. Argh!!!!

                              <span>So in my work, we have a range of web portals we administrate, most with specific links required to access them. How do I store these securely so that in the event there&#x27;s a new starter, etc... they&#x27;re readily available to use.
 Apologies if this has been answered before, I couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for as I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it.

 They all think tickets are just a way for us to not take them serious, and they tell me why should I put in a ticket?
 What is your experience with this issue? Do they all just create tickets?

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all! I started working for a small nonprofit and I&#x27;ve been tasked with improving their network infrastructure. Currently, all their main network is in one main building and it&#x27;s branching out to 2 separate buildings with an outdoor CAT 6 cable that is just hanging through the roof (it goes through trees as well). Of course, the internet in the outbuildings is very poor, barely reaching 50mbps while the main building has speeds of ~500mbps. 
 I&#x27;m proposing using Fibre optic cable underground that goes from the main building to the two outbuildings. My plan is as follows:
  
Dig a trench of about 18-30&quot; deep. 
 Use PVC for conduit and pass armored pre-terminated single mode Fibre optic cable through it. 
 The ends will be connected to media converters to convert the optic signals both ways. 
 The media converters will then be connected to the router with an ethernet cable and from there to the switches. 
  
In yalls opinions, is this a sound plan? Am I missing anything or not taking into consideration something? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We have 2 datacenters, connect by 4 switches and 100Gbit trunks. We found out that the 100Gbit trunk is limiting our network performance. We place 2 servers 1 in each datacenter. Each server has a 100Gbit network card but 40gbit dac cable. We can only reach 30gbit instead of 39/40 bit with iperf. When the servers where directly connected they reached 39/40. Does anybody know what is going wrong ?
 The connection is like this
 Server -&gt; 40gbit -&gt; switch -&gt; 100Gbit &lt;- switch &lt;- 40gbit &lt;- server
 All switches are dell S5232f We ordered 100Gbit dac to check what will happen on that speed.
 Maybe someone has had the same problem before?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Earlier today I found out about this interesting problem i just can&#x27;t wrap my mind about.
 We recently purchased new big ass Palo Alto firewalls for DMZ/Internet Access.
 Declared Threat Prevention throughput is over 120Gbit/s appmix. Our Internet connection is 100G.
 We&#x27;re not done with the migration yet so we&#x27;re pushing through roughly 2Gbit/s atm.
 We&#x27;re doing SSL decryption on all HTTPS traffic over the standard and a few not standard ports.
 I had two incidents open from our colleagues who reported huge performance hit while working on VPN and downloading specific files. Upload was fine.
 Went on to check myself and I was able to reproduce it on quite a few sites that are inspected.
 These guys who reported the issue also captured a speedtest image of a known speedtest site …</span>

 I know VyOS, FRRouting, Mikrotik, Linux...
 I&#x27;m thinking of testing/using SONiC... any other ideas?
 It is a traffic that more or less 10Gbps
 I need IPv6, VXLAN, BGP, OSPF...

                              <span>Was doing some reading on VLAN 0 and how it&#x27;s a tag that gets applied to traffic requiring CoS but is not associated with a VLAN. Then it got me thinking: what traffic aside from switch-generated traffic (ie: STP, CDP, etc.) wouldn&#x27;t actually get tagged across a trunk anyway? According to Cisco:
  
A switch may also have to send untagged traffic across a trunk link. Untagged traffic is generated by a switch and may also come from legacy devices. The 802.1Q trunk port places untagged traffic on the native VLAN. The native VLAN on a Cisco switch is VLAN 1 (i.e., default VLAN).
  
So lets say a legacy device with a NIC driver that doesn&#x27;t support VLAN tags is plugged into an Access Port. It sends traffic. An Access Port in a VLAN environment is always going to associate incoming traffic from an end device with a VLAN. To that point, wouldn&#x27;t the traffic get tagged with that ID as it traverses a trunk port? What is it that&#x27;s telling the switch to not apply a VLAN ID? There must be something, no?

                              <span>I work as the sole sysadmin at an SMB (50-100 employees). We have two physical servers running Windows Server 2016 and 2019, both hosting Hyper-V VMs (&lt;10 combined) in an AD environment. We also have a QNAP NAS for file storage. Given the following constraints, which is the least laughable option for backing up my VMs to the QNAP? (If not obvious from the below list, all are free options for me at the moment)
  
Using QNAP&#x27;s built-in Hyper Data Protector tool
 Running Veeam Community on a separate, older Dell PowerEdge 1850 (would be spinning up as 3rd physical server)
 Running Veeam Community as a VM on one of the two Windows Servers
  
I&#x27;m currently backing them up using QNAP&#x27;s HDP, which has been working fine. I&#x27;m a little nervous about its reliability and potential for vulnerabilities though, given it&#x27;s not QNAP&#x27;s main forte and they&#x27;re not the most responsive to fixing them. I thought about trying out Veeam to see why everyone likes it so much. I know running on old hardware is a little risky, but I fear running it as a VM on the same hardware as the rest is riskier. If there&#x27;s another free option I&#x27;m missing here that you&#x27;d recommend, I&#x27;d love to hear it.

                              <span>A website I&#x27;m hosting got it&#x27;s domain and/or ip listed on a blocklist that Sophos appliances and some AV/Web Filtering clients use. This is to the best of my knowledge a false positive or a human error. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if you guys have any resources to find what major security appliances, EDR, AV, web filter vendors have added us to their list and maybe even get a category / reason for that block. 
 I&#x27;m basing my assumption on the fact that some vendors like fortigate have a publicly available filter search with the possibility to ask for a review of a specific ip or url like here:

                              <span>Was interviewed for a security analyst job for the second time, I did badly answering some of the questions and the CIO (an old man) looked grumpy and seemed that he didn’t care about what I had to say after the first 4 questions, in fact, he wasn’t even paying attention and was just straight laughing as I tried my best… Although I mentioned I enjoy doing this kind of work, the old guy said it’s not a fun job and will be stressful which I totally understand. However, in the first interview, the recruiter mentioned that he wanted someone to enjoy doing the work and doesn’t want a lazy person who just clocks in and clocks out and treats it as a 9-5 job.
 Should I just withdraw from the job posting rather than getting a rejection email? In my opinion, I felt disrespected and insulted because of this… Although I can take plenty of hits, the job workplace culture seemed toxic, especially because it’s just 2 employees the head of the department and a regular security analyst.

                              <span>Sorry if this is an unorthadox post, but is there a way to get the latest (or last) SPP for older HPE Proliant Gen8/9 servers that are no longer under HPE Support? Getting this from HPE is not an option. Is there a repository somewhere, lets say for &quot;testing and lab use only&quot; that would have SPP bundles for older Gen8 and Gen9 Proliant servers.
 Or is it possible to download the firmware individually from HPE or any other source? My 3rd party hardware maintenance vendor will not provide any firmware - although I know they have it.

                              <span>I work for a hardware vendor. Businesses/customer buy our hardware (multimillion dollar capex equipment), generate petabytes of data on it yearly and they need to get the data from our hardware onto their network for subsequent analysis. 
 Now whenever my company needs to connect our hardware to your network, IT inevitably must get involved.
 The biggest pushback is that my company’s hardware cannot be managed by the customers IT infrastructure whatsoever. (No domain joining, or any kind of endpoint protection). We expressly state in the purchase agreement that the equipment is managed and supported by my company.
 Our equipment is meant to be a single user device and has no need to contact the outside internet. Connecting to any network is only necessary for transferring the data collected. Technically, we have a samba server running on the equipment, and that single (or maybe the small group) of users have the credentials. 
 Would you then describe the equipment as an “appliance” (cannot be managed by policy)?
 Is this a common scenario in your company (you have an outside vendors equipment wanting to connect to your network)?
 What would you require (or assuage your security concerns) from the vendor? 
 In most cases I’ve told folks that they can secure the VLAN (firewalls, routing) by restricting what resources the equipment can access when connected to their network, but it seems like I have to go five levels deep in their organization to get this to happen.

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeing several jobs advertising &quot;On Call.&quot;
 While I know what the words mean, I cannot picture what an On call pay structure is like.
 Is it like being an Uber for helpdesk calls or something? Does it mean that you are paid per call, or for the hours that you are on call?
 Reason I ask is because I have a decent job in another field.. I desperatly want to get into IT and am willing to pay my dues.. but not go into bankruptcy for the first few years that I&#x27;d be entry level. My perfect situation would be a job that&#x27;s 3-5 hours a day that I could work before or after my present job.
 I&#x27;ve tried part time.. what a joke. The part time positions want 40-45 hours a week.. they just claim part time to not pay benefits.

                              <span>Currently, we have a situation where we have a CNX file that connects to a database in a specific folder. I attempted to modify this file by changing the database name and saved the CNX file. However, the saved CNX file still contained the old database name. To fix this issue, I deleted the original CNX file and attempted to create a new one. However, when I tried to save the new CNX file, the file editor showed that the CNX file already existed in the folder, even though I could not find the file in the folder. To investigate further, I created a new folder with the same name as the original folder. However, when I tried to create a new CNX file in the new folder, the file editor showed that a CNX file already existed in the empty folder.
 I am unsure why this issue is occurring, as I have checked APPDATA to ensure there are no old files causing the issue. Do you have any ideas as to what may be causing this problem?
 -Tried searching APPDATA for old information to delete -Deleted the old folder and created the same folder name, but this showed a ghost CNX file in the newly created folder.

I found out today the my techs are manually copying these files to a synology where it then backs up to wasabi. Sure seems like a lot of overhead for something like this.

 Currently dealing with a delicate genius (Seinfeld) who drags on tasks because they are too afraid to ask for help. No type of troubleshooting skills. If they do not understand it, it is automatically considered misconfigured or wrong and should be removed.
 If you dont understand VMWare, its fine. Find someone who does. Dont assume taking a class for a week automatically makes you an expert.
 You know how god awful it is to hear them say how difficult it is to apply a certificate to a ESXi host.

 A lot of them are discontinued. Can anyone here tell me what exactly that means? What disadvantages or problems does that create. Will I still be able to purchase things needed to keep it running? Is buying a good working model that&#x27;s discontinued worth it? Thanks.

                              <span>Posting this here since I work as a sysadmin for a mid-large sized company. A manager for the region in which I live asked if we had a technology vendor for disposal of equipment. I happen to have a desire to do this on the side and had started a very small website/advertisement in my area expressing this. I guess my question is: is there any danger in suggesting my own company as a vendor for my job? Much of the collection work can be outsourced so there’s no danger of anyone really seeing me collecting the equipment.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a Windows system administrator for the past 10 years at a small company, but as the solo IT guy here, there was never a need for me to keep up with the latest standards and technologies as long as my stuff worked.
 All the servers here are Windows 2012 R2 and I&#x27;m familiar with Hyper-V, Active Directory, Group Policies, but I use the GUI for almost everything and know only a few basic Powershell commands. I was able to install and set up a pfSense firewall on a VM and during COVID I was able to set up a VPN server on it so that people could work remotely, but I just followed a YouTube tutorial on how to do it.
 I feel I only have a broad understanding of how everything works which usually allows me to figure out what I need to Google to find the specific solution, but it gives me deep imposter syndrome. Is there a certification I should go for or a test somewhere that I can take to see where I stand?
 I want to leave this company to make more money elsewhere, but before I start applying elsewhere, what skills should I brush up on that I would be expected to know? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Until now I&#x27;ve run all of my servers without a cPanel/WHM solution. Now I&#x27;m getting to the point where I need to spend less time installing/maintaining and more time on other things.
 Wondering if any of you prefer anything in particular over cPanel/WHM?
 Edit
 I&#x27;m a bit of a control freak and like to build my Apache, PHP and MySQL from source. I&#x27;m willing to give that up.

 What is your go to system for a rugged laptop with Cell capabilities? We&#x27;ve been put in a pickle and need to find something relatively quick(in stock sku). Usage is fairly light, timeline is tight and ethernet/wifi is abysmal at best so looking for something with 4G or 5G.

                              <span>I was working with a department within my organization that is utilizing a vendor provided web app. In order to get SSO to work correctly in MS Edge, we need to add login.microsoftonline.com to the EMIE mode as a neutral entity (open in: none).
 We have several other web apps using that for SSO, so I fear that it could impact those apps. In theory, it shouldnt because it’s neutral, but wanted to check to see if any other people knew more.

                              <span>Hello everyone! We have two HPE MSA 1050s and we want to replicate the data from the first one onto the second one, while keeping both as separate entities. Additionally, our boss would like to be able to access the data and create a backup on an external drive or something. We are part of the maintenance team, but we are not experts in this device, and we were asked to create backups using just the manuals as guidance. We have tried using snapshots and copying volumes, but those methods do not meet the requirement of having a backup that can be accessed from other devices like an external drive (since it only creates a snapshot or volume copy in the disks that belong to disk groups within the same MSA). So the question would be, how can we make this? Is there a way or is it just what it is?
 We know that in case of a disk failure the spares will take over and replace the degraded one, but that it not enough for our boss, he is convinced everything will break at the same time and we will end up losing ALL the data.

 But how do you actually network to get a job? I&#x27;ve asked all my friends, and the responses I get are either &quot;we&#x27;re not hiring,&quot; or (most common response) &quot;I&#x27;m a low level accountant at a Fortune 500 company, don&#x27;t know anyone in IT, sorry.&quot; 
 A lot of my friends are either software engineers, or work in finance. I am looking for IT support and sysadmin jobs jobs. The only friends I have in those careers work for companies which do not have any current job openings. 
 So, how do I get a job this way? It&#x27;s frustrating because I know for a fact I&#x27;ve been passed over for several jobs because someone else had an in.

 I am learning my way around AD and noticed that if an user is logged in to a workstation and needs admin rights for a task, only by typing ‘.\admin’ as the user works but not simply ‘admin’ (followed by the password of course). 
 Could someone explain why?

 I don&#x27;t really care about multimedia. Mostly text. I&#x27;d like a feature where I can easily update a To-Do list on my front page maybe. 
 Anybody have any good suggestions?

                              <span>Several customers with Microsoft 365 / Office 365 can no longer use Office for Mac after an update. After successful activation of the Office installation, Office switches back to unlicensed. Trying to activate Office again ends in the error message: It occurs if you&#x27;re already signed in through a different Microsoft 365 user account in the same organization.
 We have already reset the licenses with the License Removal Tool, cleaned up the keychain, removed Office completely, obtained it from the App Store and even installed the previous March version. All unfortunately unsuccessful. 
 Since it now affects three Microsoft 365 tenants, we can&#x27;t be alone with the problem. Does anyone else have similar issues or information from Microsoft? 
 I would be grateful for any hints.

                              <span>My organization is looking at putting Tableau Reader on 1000+ machines. Apparently there is no way to disable the registration page on first launch. Have you found that there is a way to automate the process or eliminate it for the users on a large scale? We need to put this on every machine, and my leadership hates the page. They also don&#x27;t want to have to send/receive data for security reasons if we do not need to.
 https://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/disabling-registration-in-reader
 Note, I have found a way to prefill the registration page with data via registry (HKEY Local User). Not the best answer but at least they would only have to hit 1 button. Anything that we can do before install or before issues a system would be appreciated. It does require it per user login at this time, but only once.

                              <span>Hey all.
 Is there anyone here who has migrated all their compute FROM AWS TO On-Prem?
 We currently have all our servers (AD, SQL, ERP, File Shares, etc.) on an AWS VPC. We would like to bring all that compute back to our on-prem data center. We will be hosting all those virtualized servers on VMWare vSphere.
 I could find a lot of write-up and documentation on how move from on-prem to AWS, but nothing to do the reverse.
 Has anyone done this? What do I need to be aware of? What are the risks? Is there a standard process?
 Hence this post.
 Any and all help greatly appreciated.

 Im looking at MDM solutions for a company about 120 machines, and Im interested in putting it in the mix to see pricing/features, but for the life of me, I cannot find it. I swore I saved it in Reddit, but cannot find it after searching for 20 minutes. 
 Hoping someone can point me in the right direction on this, as I want to give them a fair shake.

                              <span>I&#x27;m one of two IT employees at a small company. In terms of Employees we have probably about 75 and PC&#x27;s about the same amount.
 We are looking into an IT Ticketing/Service Management system because as of right now we have no system to speak of. When users have issues, they come get us, and with the amount of work starting to pick up, it&#x27;s starting to become an issue
 The main features that we are looking for are
  
A Ticketing system (pretty self explanatory)
 A system with some sort of knowledge base so we can centralize our Documentation
 Asset Management to keep track of all hardware that we manage
 Some sort of remote assistance tool that isn&#x27;t VPN/RDP based. (We have multiple sets over an hour apart and it become a real pain when we need to do any sort of support to the other site)
  
What&#x27;s the best way to go about getting all of the features? is there any system/software that has these features(but wont break the bank)? 
 Would it make more sense or be more cost effective if we were to look for multiple tools to do all of these things?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve worked with TopDesk before at a previous job, but that&#x27;s about it for experience with these systems
 Any ideas would be appreciated, Thanks!

                              <span>This may seem stupid, but I&#x27;ve gone into analysis paralysis.
 I can&#x27;t decide how to design the network in a new office. I am going to designate entire /16 for it, but I can&#x27;t decide how to carve out specific subnets. I&#x27;m thinking of doing something like:
 VLAN 10 - 10.50.10.0/23
 VLAN 20 - 10.50.20.0/24
 VLAN 30 - 10.50.30.0/24
 and so on. I can&#x27;t yet decide whether it&#x27;s a stupid idea to let subnets follow VLAN tags, and to left out such big chunks unassigned and unused, or whether I should go with my gut feeling and just do what feels natural and easy to manage overall. I&#x27;m the sole administrator here. We will hire more people for 1st line support in the future, so I&#x27;m keen to keep things simple and descriptive.
 I&#x27;ve always been supporting what&#x27;s already there, adding things into existing environments setup by people before me. I&#x27;ve never had an opportunity like that, to setup a completely new office from the ground up, so I feel paralysed by the sheer number of possibilities. I am clearly overthinking this, I know.

 I would start with a simple request like, &quot;If I don&#x27;t receive an email from Bob by 10 am send him a follow-up to ask about the status of the contract we are working on.&quot;
 I know I have all the pieces to build this on my own but thought I would see if anybody has found something already to do this.

                              <span>Hello sysadmins,
 I have an issue I can&#x27;t seem to figure out. My org had an On-Prem Exchange server that they decommissioned several years back (before my time) when they moved to a hybrid Azure environment. All mail is Exchange Online now.
 When they started syncing users to Azure/O365, they left many of the current employees with a &quot;company.local&quot; UPN Suffix, as opposed to &quot;company.com.&quot; They also left all the msExch* attributes in tact.
 I recently implemented Conditional Access policies for MFA, and they wanted employees on site to be able to use a Hybrid-Joined computer in lieu of the MFA verification.
 So I set that up, but we discovered that it didn&#x27;t work for some users. I found that it was due to the &quot;company.local&quot; UPN discrepancy between local AD and Azure (which had &quot;company.com&quot; as the Azure UPN). I switch the suffix and it fixed the CA issue.
 Director says to move everyone to the correct suffix to make it work, so I did that. Since the UPN&#x27;s match, every user&#x27;s msExch attributes are linked correctly in Exchange Online. 
 Users now show this error in the admin.microsoft.com portal, under their Mail tab: This user&#x27;s on-premises mailbox hasn&#x27;t been migrated to ‎Exchange Online‎. The ‎Exchange Online‎ mailbox will be available after migration is completed.
 These user&#x27;s already had a mailbox, and it seems that most of them have no issues using mail still. We did have one user who&#x27;s mailbox disappeared, I removed the msExchMailboxGuid and other related attributes from their local AD account, and had to remove and reassign their Exchange Online license. This created a new mailbox for them, but it is a fresh mailbox and does not have any previous mail in it.
 I changed the Sync Rules in AD Connect to push NULL out for the msExchMailboxGuid for all users, and it did sync the NULL value for everyone. But the error is still there over a day later.
 Is there any way to resolve this without losing everyone&#x27;s mailbox?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I am currently trying to pass 5 NVMe disks to a storage VM as a passthrough device. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find the right option in the BIOS that allows this. The NVMes are attached to this controller: &quot;HPE MR416i-a Gen10+&quot;. Of course I didn&#x27;t create a logical drive and the disks are marked as JBODs.
 I know from an old server that you can mark the NVMe as PT-Enabled and then you can select it as a PCI device in the VM settings.
 Does anyone have any idea what the appropriate setting is and where to find it? Thank you very much!
 Regards,
 Chris

                              <span>Been working in IT for over 25 years and I think I&#x27;m done. Got into it by accident - I was good at Excel, and moved up via tech support, service desk management, architecture, general jack of all trades and eventually into Senior Sys admin roles.
 Tbh I just don&#x27;t have the interest anymore - I&#x27;d rather be doing something practical and more creative and maybe even, and I never thought I&#x27;d say it, something that involves more interaction with people. Has anybody successfully transitioned to a different type of role. What skills would you say are transferable and what skills sysadmins usually posess have you found employers appreciate in other roles?

 The main task is to mask data in a testing environment. Virtual Data Pipeline (VDP) is not a mandatory feature.

But I think it would be beneficial for organisation who has a good understanding and for my role as well
 Can someone please share some solid or practical resources I can refer to, it would be super appreciated for your support.

                              <span>Dear Internet people, 
 i am stuck. And kinda out of ideas.
 I need to move some vms from vmware to hyperv. Simple question: how?
 Ive tried a few ways I&#x27;ve found on google but it didn&#x27;t seem to work.
 Anyone of you did something similar in the past and got some tips for me?
 ​
 cheers

                              <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m sorry for what might seem like a dumb question. 
 In my day to day work I make tools for myself in python to make my job more easy and efficient and in some cases enjoyable. some of my coworkers have seen some of these tools and asked to get the tools as well.
 In the past it has not been an issue to use something like autopytoexe to convert my script to an executable that my colleagues could use but as security becomes a bigger concern restrictions on user machines naturally becomes stricter, something, I&#x27;m all for.
 However one of these restrictions is that antivirus now has gone from &quot;I recognize this software as a virus because x,y,z&quot; to &quot;I don&#x27;t recognize this software as a safe software&quot;.
 I understand this move completely as it makes it more difficult to obscure your virus, even if it confuses me a little bit that it doesn&#x27;t treat excel macro&#x27;s and bat files the same (I mean I know exactly why but I find the compromise frustrating).
 Is there a smart way to legitimize a piece of software I wrote for a small team of about 30 people without compromising security or teaching the users that &quot;it&#x27;s ok to open exe files as long as its from someone I trust&quot;?
 Submitting the software for review with our antivirus provider and Microsoft is time consuming and expensive, and I have some concern with installing python on users machines.
 I could make some of the tools web accessible but that adds significant development time and a tool made to start with windows and remind you to stand up once in a while wouldn&#x27;t work as a web application.

                              <span>Hi. I dont see option 7 when trying to configure automatic updates. 
 ​
  
7 &#x3D; Notify for install and notify for restart. (Windows Server only)
 With this option from Windows Server 2016, applicable only to Server SKU devices, local administrators will be allowed to use Windows Update to proceed with installations or reboots manually.
  
Forgive me for being stupid, but my Google searches arent throwing up the reference material im after. From reading it seems that this is specific to 2016 and Im guessing the reason I dont see this option is because my domain is aging (2012 functional level) and we&#x27;re only getting round to upgrading OS&#x27;s now SO perhaps the relevant ADMX files arent there. 
 This stems from an unexplained reboot relating to windows updates on a test 2016 VM - we&#x27;ve been advised to use option 7 ... so I wanted to test this to see what it looks like.
 Id be grateful for a reference to back this up?

                              <span>I wonder how everyone handles users creating folders manually in the OneDrive Company root folder?
 Users are able to create folders in &quot;C:\Users\username\tenant&quot;, and these folders show in the company folder in the OneDrive client, but they&#x27;re not synced. Users can store a ton of documents there and expect them to be backuped, etc.
 Any way to block or disable this?
 For clarification, I&#x27;m referring to the Contoso folder you can find here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-sharepoint-and-teams-files-with-your-computer-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88

 Assume for security &amp; monitoring purpose; I used serial/console ports to connect all the switches to optical converters in a datacenter. I will now Mux/Demux the fiber optic connection to 20/30km remote location. Are my switches secure ? Also is it also a right way to do it?

So my questions is, if im mostly interested in VMware, Veeam backup, storage, Exchange on prem admin, Endpoint protection, is it worth getting a CCNA as first cert? I work for an MSP that does a lot of networking work, so i think it will come in handy..

                              <span>Hi All!
 We&#x27;re trying out CodeTwo&#x27;s MS365 signatures and I&#x27;m going to have to update everybody&#x27;s profile info so that the placeholders can be populated on the signatures. I don&#x27;t want to update all the info within Azure AD and then preform a sync from on-prem at a later date and have it all wiped out (is that correct?)
 Currently there is no sync between our on-prem AD Servers (2) and Azure.
 I was going to setup the Azure AD Cloud Sync but had a few questions I need help with:
  
Am I correct in saying that the sync is 1-way only, on-prem to Azure? So I make all changes on-prem?
 Will there be any interference with our MS365 email accounts once the initial sync has completed, as we use different passwords for AD and Emails.
 Any other gotcha&#x27;s I need to watch out for? 
  
Thank you.

                              <span>A storage pool was using SSD as a cache tier and HDD for capacity, with read-only data. SSD burned out, literally. Is it possible to access the data on the HDD? Since SSD was only a cache for read-only data, all of the data should be on the HDD just fine. But I cannot figure out how to get to it. The data is available in offside backup, so no big deal if it&#x27;s impossible, but would be great to avoid the pain of restoring a massive remote backup, given that all the data should be on the hdd.

 I&#x27;m about to run out of ideas! Does anyone have any advice?

 How do I clear the config of a switchport on a cisco switch? I&#x27;ve tried every command on the internet however I am unable to do it. See ssh output below when I try to use &quot;default interface ge20&quot;. I have a teams VOIP phone that seems to add a ton of configuration to a switchport upon connection which I want to remove.

                              <span>Hi
 I would like to force our users to run Edge with English language but I need European decimal seperator.
 I need it to look like this: 1.000,25
 When choosing English US or UK I get
 1,000.25
 which is confusing for the users.
 Directly in Windows you can choose English European which does this correct, are there a similar language in Edge?

                              <span>Hello.
 We have a system that is published as a bunch of RemoteApps on RDS server.
 It was requested to be built for our own users, and is working fine for that purpose.
 Now they have requested another external company gain access to this system as well.
 Any suggestions on how to solve this task? I can&#x27;t imagine creating AD users for every employee from the other company and allowing them access that way through.
 RemoteApps and RDS servers is not a field I&#x27;m very familiar with, so I don&#x27;t know what options I have. I have heard about Azure AD Application Proxy before, could that be a solution or is that for something else entirely?
 Best regards.

                              <span>Are you aware of any company that can do the following: 
  
Supports crawling and indexing file, block, and object storage to extract files&#x27; metadata.
 Supports crawling any vendor’s storage.
 Supports crawling all major file systems and protocols (POSIX-compliant, NFS, CIFS, iSCSI etc.).
 Runs completely on-prem without sending metadata outside of the company&#x27;s environment.
 Crawls billions of files over NFS in an efficient manner without overloading underlying storage infrastructure.
 Crawls and indexes the entire environment on a regular basis such as daily etc.
  
I found few solutions on the Internet but wanted to hear your suggestions and preferably experiences that you had with them.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello, I have come across an issue with our Windows 365 VMs. We have McAfee Proxy installed on our workstations which includes W365 and Physical Devices. We come across an intermittent issue with upgrade issues with our W365 VMs where it fails to upgrade and the logs are not very helpful. We opened a ticket with MS and they stated McAfee Proxy is causing the issue but cannot explain why it is not happening on our physical devices. We tested uninstalling MCP on at least 5 failed VMs and it allows to upgrade successfuly to Windows 11.
 I am checking to see if anyone else experienced this? MS provided me this link today to have them whitelisted in MCP so I will try that step next Connection endpoints for Windows 11 Enterprise - Windows Privacy | Microsoft Learn

I&#x27;ve heard the bank of questions for this exam is pretty extensive and to my surprise that this exam is all multiple choice questions with no actual CLI simulation questions. I was just curious if anyone had taken this exam recently and could verify that? Also, any tips on studying for this particular exam would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a label printer with several specifications, Our office uses Brother printers. Brother being a brand that has worked well for us, wouldn&#x27;t mind having a label printer by them. I cant however seem to figure out which one of their label printers will meet all my criteria. I appreciate any recommendations: 
  
Wireless interface so that multiple PCs can print to the same label printer
 Be reliable and durable
 Able to use generic cheap labels
 Budget friendly (Preferably under $300usd)

 Had a client call in saying their workstation swapped and renewed its IP address which should have been reserved in Unifi and all the software it hosts couldn&#x27;t be accessed. 
 The client is fairly tech savy and had gone to look at the IPV4 setting at Settings &gt; ethernet and noticed the Ip setting said manual. Their theory is the reservation wasn&#x27;t moved to the new MAC address when this workstation was replaced about 6 months ago, and static was set up in Windows.

 I am trying to reflect this by using ncclient. Assuming I&#x27;d be using ncclient.manager.connect.get(), how would I request an entire data model from a device? 
 I have tried creating an xml filter with just the xmlns of the desired model, but that doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Are there any network engineers that have this cert?
 I don&#x27;t need it for work, but I&#x27;m wondering if reading the study guide is worth it to get a better grasp on wireless standards/best practices, etc...
 Wireless in the office is mainly for web surfing and emails and I deal with a lot of pt to pt wireless links for IP cameras in some remote work locations. The pt to pt links are under 1000 ft and as long as the radios are configured properly and have LOS they basically link up and work, but I don&#x27;t understand 80% of the settings in the wireless radio settings.
 I&#x27;m not looking to become a wireless expert, but it seems that there is more to wifi than adding APs and moving closer to the AP. Yes, there is a thing as too many APs, I was just giving an example.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been studying up on MAC addresses recently, specifically the Universal/Local bit that Apple and Android take advantage of for MAC randomization.
 RFC 7042 says:
  
OUIs and longer MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit zero and the Group bit unspecified.
  
But seems to contradict itself one paragraph later.
  
If the Local bit is on, the holder of an OUI has no special authority over MAC identifiers whose first 3 octets correspond to their OUI.
  
In my mind, it only makes sense that all OUIs would be assigned with U/L bit set to 0, however I see many examples of OUIs that have the U/L bit set to 1:
  
02:C0:8C - 3COM
 02:70:B3 - DATA RECALL LTD.
 02:9D:8E - CARDIAC RECORDERS, INC.
 02:70:B0 - M/A-COM INC. COMPANIES
 AA:00:04 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:07:01 - RACAL-DATACOM
 AA-00-00 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:BB:01 OCTOTHORPE CORP.
  
... among others.
 Why is it that some OUIs have been assigned with the local bit set to 1? Is this just a mistake by the IEEE Registration Authority? Are addresses that start with these assigned OUI prefixes still LAAs or would they be considered UAAs? If I&#x27;m generating LAAs, do I need to avoid using these assigned OUI prefixes?

 I want to make sure that when I am installing I don’t exceed the cables bend radius.
 Anyone have any recommendations on bend radius gauges? 
 I found a few cheap ones on amazon which seem like they would fit the job, but I wanted to get other recommendations in case there was a better option.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have an old 3560 that we use as our external router. We finally upgraded our ISP to over 500mbps, so I need to swap the switch out. We have 2 ASA behind that in standby pair.
 I inherited this network, and sure enough I don’t have any internal information on it or what the running / startup config right now, I’ll need to console into the switch to see.
 I have some 2960’s around, but I’m a bit rusty here.
 It looks like it has 12.2(58)SE1-ip-serv-crypto running on it.
  
The “IP-Serv-Crypto” is the Layer 3 routing part of iOS? I’ll need to get a license for the 2960 and flash the new image to just to use one of my old switches on hand if what I’m assuming is correct. But that seems like it would be better to just acquire a new switch.
 
What would you guys / gals recommend if purchasing something new? I’m seeing the new “Cisco Business” stuff popping around.
 
 I appreciate any advice.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing my final year thesis on the performance of some dynamic routing protocols. I&#x27;m using GNS3 for the simulation, I can configure the routers and routing protocols just fine. I however do not know how to measure these performance metrics. 
 I know to measure convergence I need to send ping packets across the network. (Do I count the packet loss as convergence?). can I do this with wireshark (I have no idea how to use it but I&#x27;ve watched a few youtube videos)
 for packet loss, i think I can figure it out with wireshark. however any other help is welcomed 
 how do i measure delay?
 please help!

                              <span>We are a full Cisco shop with 9300 series for most MDF/IDF switches (edge and L3 routing). A few 9500 series as well for our data centers (L3). We were looking into switching to Juniper switches, but looking for what models would be more of a direct comparison. Not sure if 4100/4400 is better for IDF/Edge switching, and 4650 is more of a 9500 replacement. Thoughts?

                              <span>As I&#x27;m moving through my journey being a lower-level Technician currently dealing with break-fix, I&#x27;m starting to find myself involved with a few more projects. How does everyone deal with the first stages of a request/demand? 
 Generally, a break-fix case is straightforward in that something is broken and you need to weed out information about the problem to fix it. Most systems are already in place, nothing new (generally) needs to be built/designed, or implemented. Anything new is usually ephemeral, required only for the duration of the troubleshooting, and generally doesn&#x27;t have the same &quot;will this scale&quot; scrutiny applied. 
 I&#x27;m struggling to a degree with the Project side of things where you effectively get a wall of text from a Customer (Requirements, Demands, current/future state, Access required) all jumbled up into a little story with a whole heap of pleasantries, and thinking about how I break this down into something I can track, how I can assign or verify certain pieces with other teams, etc. 
 Right off the bat, Emails and Tickets are a task at breaking down possibly hundreds of small subtasks and requests into something that can be actioned (Intertwined with spelling/grammar and sometimes confusing sentences). 
 How does everyone do it? Do you start with kick-off meetings first, do you try to break down their initial correspondence into something like Trello or Excel and track all of the different points? Does anyone have a system for taking requests, pondering on them for a bit and effectively getting tasks/deliverables and questions from them to progress a project?

                              <span>Hello All!
 I&#x27;m quite new to IP transit and Peering but I have a few questions and if you could confirm if my understanding is correct?
 ​
 #IP Transit
 IP Transit would be to access the provider&#x27;s peers, So for example, if I was with HE, I could connect to Comcast customers but not Comast&#x27;s peers? 
 However, Arelion shows additional peers on the BGP Report? Which means I could also connect to GTT customers?
 ​
 #Peering
 Peering wise, I know peering with content providers like Netflix can be highly beneficial, however, how does it work if you peer with an IP transit provider?
 ​
 So if I peered with HE, I would be able to connect to their customers but not their peers, so no connection to Comcast customers? 
 ​
 #Peering Customers
 Customer-wise, would that be companies that have gotten IP transit with HE?
 If I&#x27;m peering with HE that means to connect to me via HE you would need their IP transit? So would I be considered a peer of HE or is it more complicated?
 ​
 Is that the case for most IP transit providers that offer peering? 
 I&#x27;m not sure if there are some providers that may only peer their own ASN but require IP Transit to reach the rest of their network or customers on their IP transit service.

                              <span>Hi,
 I know this is a long shot but maybe the solution is right in front of my eyes.
 I need to evaluate the number of links needed to interconnect my X routers. While I want to minimize the number of links, I want to be sure that there is a shortest path of at most Y hops and a backup path of at most Y+Z hops.
 I use variables (X, Y and Z) so I can simulate multiple scenarios.
 I have been trying to implement that on NetworkX but cannot find the right way to do it. I suppose it needs a mathematician&#x27;s brain that I do not have.
 How would you solve this problem?
 Cheers

                              <span>Hey all, 
 Looking for a bit of confirmation on something I am trying to resolve with regards to DNS. A number of FW vendors (Fortinet, Cisco, Palo etc) offer a feature where a DNS record can be inspected that the reply amended to provide a different result, for example to give an internal client a different IP address. 
 I am trying to understand which vendors support the translation of the additional records field within an SRV record. It looks like all can successfully translate A records etc. 
 With an SRV record, it will usually contain in the answer an FQDN in the reply. As the FQDN needs to be resolved anyway, rather than wait for the requestor to send another A-Record translation request the SRV record will often pre-empt this and include the response to the A-Record lookup in its additional records data. (So even though the client hasn&#x27;t expressly asked for it, it gets given it anyway)
 Particular interest in Cisco ASA - anyone know if the ASA can translate the information that is presented in the additional records field of DNS?
 Cheers
 J

                              <span>I am working on reducing/getting rid of SPOFs in our environment.
 Firewalls are 2x Watchguard M270 Switches are 2x USW-PRO-24
 I am not a network admin so I am a bit out of my depth, I think I am on the right track but I would like a sanity check
 A crude drawing of my setup here:
 https://i.imgur.com/1ztQUCX.png
 Currently my setup is as above with the exception of the green coloured lines/X, what I want to do is wire up so my switches are fully redundantly connected with the firewalls, as I currently have servers connected to the switches but if SWITCH1 dies we lose internet/VLAN routing.
 So, in short:
  
add new interface to watchguard cluster (so one new port on each FW)
 connect both of those ports to SWITCH2
 delete the current line between SWITCH1 and SWITCH2
  
Would love some input if this looks alright or if I am about to create a loop and what I should do instead.

                              <span>Can anyone tell me why a PTZ camera I purchased boots on my Cisco 3560G-24PS (802.3af) but not on either of my small PoE switches (Netgear GS308P, TP-Link TL-SF1008P) that are rated the same 15.4w as the Cisco and also say 802.3af? The camera spec says 15w max and says PoE 802.3af as well. The camera power lights just come on dimly and fade out every few seconds like it&#x27;s not getting enough power on the small switches but as far as I know, they are rated for the same spec as the Cisco. I run a few security cameras off both small switches so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about the Cisco over the other switches. The only thing I can think of is that the Cisco might be sending power before negotiation completes or the small ones have some issue negotiating and don&#x27;t deliver power long enough for it to complete.

                              <span>Hi, how do you escalate to Cisco Meraki Support? 
 We are getting nowhere with just having a case open and calling them for follow ups.
 All they are giving us they are looking into it.
 ​
 Any idea how to proceed with escalation?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>I joined a small start-up about 3 months ago. In the interview, I was promised &quot;a good and friendly team you can rely on&quot;. After joining, everything was going well. I was getting used to work culture, learning their procedures and after a month or two, I had a pretty good handle on things. In fact, I was able to learn/understand a lot of processes/tools without proper training or documentation. According to my manager &quot;I am grasping everything very well&quot; and he was pretty happy with my work here. 
 A month and a half after joining, my manager resigned and my teammate(same level and working 8 months longer than me in the company) became the lead and his attitude changed drastically after becoming my manager. Yesterday he told me I had to inform him if I am off my desk even for 5 minutes 🤯 anyway We are now only 2 people in the team. Him &amp; me. We manage helpdesk and infrastructure. 
 A week ago I asked him if I can start work half an hour early and finish early only on Mondays so that I can take my 11-month-old kid to swimming classes. I thought it was simple request and out of nowhere he told me NO because as a helpdesk/sysadmin team, we are supposed to support 9 to 5. I agreed with him and asked if he can cover for the last 30 minutes and again, the answer was NO. 
 So today I set up a meeting and asked the same thing to the senior manager and he told me &quot;because we had a couple of departures from our team, he can&#x27;t give me that flexibility. And there are no plans to hire anyone anytime soon.&quot; 
 I mean, 2 people already left in last 2 months (my manager and another colleague), are you ready to lose another just for this one small request?(I guess they are lol)
 Anyways I guess it&#x27;s time to start looking for another job. tbh, in my 10 years of career, I never had to choose between my family and my job. I always thought teammates help when needed.
 TL;DR: workplace indirectly asked me to choose between family and job

                              <span>Please help! This is driving me nuts. 
 We have some obscure Windows application which can only be installed with the installer it was installed with. 
 Problem is, our previous sys admin removed all the older packages. 
 The Windows app received about 7 updates and we only have the 3 latest installer versions. So for some people with older versions, the apps could not be removed. 
 Tried using msiexec with GUID and msiexec in combination with the latest installers. Not works. 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated!
 We are using SCCM btw.

                              <span>Users keep leaving their workstations unlocked when they step away from their desks.
 What fun stuff do u guys do to remind users to always lock their workstations if stepping away from their desks?
 We do have a GPO policy to lock after 15 mins of inactivity.

                              <span>Hello, curious how you all would handle this.
 Currently we have some servers that require starting applications up after a restart or verification that the application did not break after windows updates. This also includes taking snapshots.
 Due to that we are updating some servers manually and it takes quite some time to do it after hours. 
 Is this just a grin and bear it solution if the vendor doesn&#x27;t have a way to automate the task?
 The only half solution I can think of is to schedule snapshots and schedule updates and then still do the manual portion before opening hours rather than after. I just wonder if most people work this way or if servers needing touched after restarts are less common.

                              <span>Right now in our environment it is a choatic mess with printers...everyone has their own weird printer, from small epsons, canons, lexmark etc., you name it, on top of our huge Konica Minoltas and Epson C20600 (At least I think it is by epson iirc, I&#x27;d have to look at the notes I took again).
 As these printers die out I want to eventually bring in brother printers since I have heard good things about them, but I&#x27;m not sure how we should have our setup work.
 What I mean is, we spend so much money in various inks and it is a mess, outside of the ones we have auto managed for our surgery center.
 I was thinking that in order to save money, we have specific locations that have their own small printers, and perhaps incorporate large ones for regular workers like our call center and MA&#x27;s area.
 But I also heard that having everyone get up and having to go get their stuff can cause delays with patients etc.
 What do you guys think? There&#x27;s got to be a way to slowly move us in the direction of unity where everyone has the same brand, and also not spend thousands of dollars for all these different inks??
 At a loss on this one and I would love senior opinions from those more experienced than me.
 I appreciate it!

                              <span>So if I have a group of users who should be able to occasionally execute programs as Administrator, but who I do not want to just log in as admin every day, I have thought of making a second account for them. So user &quot;jdoe&quot; would be a regular user, but &quot;jdoe-a&quot; would have Administrator rights.
 The thinking is that you could not log into a machine as &quot;jdoe-a&quot;, but you can log in as &quot;jdoe&quot; and when it prompts for an Administrator password to escalate privileges for something, the user could think first and then enter &quot;jdoe-a&quot; credentials if appropriate.
 Is this advisable? How can I accomplish this with AD Users and Computers and/or Group Policy?
 Thank you

 We naively thought a single 3080 and some dp to hdmix2 adapters would cover the need.
 Turns out Nvidia GTX/RTX cards are capped at 4 displays.
 Nice new machine is going back in the box and back to Dell.

 This just started happening to me. A job got posted in my area and no less than 20 companies out of India all called me within the first hour of the job posting. Some of them at the same time. I have added my own to the list and made a github page as suggested by u/not_a_lob
 Github: https://github.com/SirKratosAurion/ITJobSpam
 If you come across something not on the list feel free to open an issue and I will review it.
 thanks to u/Elranzer for the original posting
 Edit: It has come to my attention via a report sent to me on github that a lot of the mail comes from the same &quot;mailed-by&quot; or &quot;signed-by&quot; headers. Gmail does not currently allow us to filter by these. If you have a moment please go to gmail and click the ? icon in the upper right corner to send feedback requesting that they allow us to filter email by these fields. https://github.com/SirKratosAurion/ITJobSpam/wiki

 I&#x27;m planning on working today but you know gonna be a bit lazy and slow. 
 I have some documents that do need updated but also get the feeling that saying you are updating docs is really a universal term in IT that means you don&#x27;t really feel like working that day and I&#x27;m sure my manager who&#x27;s been in IT for 25 years is well aware of that so I need a better excuse.

 Has anyone connected a Sophos XGS Firewall with the cellular modem add-on to the Telus cellular network in Canada? If so, what plan were you able to use with Telus? Also, what settings did you have to provide them in order to get the unit connected?
 Typically Telus will want the IMEI of the mobile device getting connected but I&#x27;m not able to find that anywhere in the Sophos XGS interface for the cell WAN connection. 
 Any advice or recommendations would be much appreciated!

                              <span>My dear friends, it&#x27;s roughly that time of year again for interns to descend on our departments asking for things they have no business having or asking things they should already know. I&#x27;m reminded of what may be the most socially oblivious intern I&#x27;ve ever come across. 
 For context, I work for a large nationwide company, and my role is a tier 2/3. I also take on a bit of security work, and a bit of networking. Kind of a jack of all trades - I&#x27;m also the only person in my position in my region of the country. Once a quarter everyone on my team gives updates at an all hands meeting, discussing the common issues that have been appearing in our regions and other metrics and things. These are big important meetings that are attended by every level of IT management up to and including the CIO…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks. Hope you&#x27;re doing well. 
 How you guys manage your Linux devices of WFH workforce?
 We have a whole Development team that works from home and uses Linux devices. Something about 15 devices. And, sadly, we don&#x27;t manage any aspect of this devices. We&#x27;re in the dark with it. 
 With Windows devices, we use Defender for Endpoint + Intune, to manage and protect. But for Linux, we don&#x27;t have anything yet. 
 Have any of you used some solution of WSL or Cloud PC to this use case? Or any other solution?
 How it worked out? What was your solutions to this kind of problem? 
 The whole Dev team is remote, so it&#x27;s hard to keep control of the devices, considering that they don&#x27;t have any technician to help them out. 
 Thanks folks :)

 I wanted to reach out to see if anyone had any experience with a door controller that uses a Badge System for employees that also integrates with Active Directory/Azure Active Directory. We are looking for automatic disablement of badges when the account gets deleted/disabled. 
 We are only able to get budget approval if the solution is a fully cloud Native Solution and requires no On-Prem infra. 
 We are currently facing issues with revoking the badge on employee terminations in a timely manner and this is proving to be a potential security/safety risk for the organization. We Currently use A Bosch system that is not up to snuff and the offerings from them require a USB cloud Dongle that requires a server....

                              <span>Hello, we want to secure the connections to our test environment a bit more, my first idea was using the Azure Application Proxy but it seems like this only works with an on-prem AD (can&#x27;t access the RDGW settings without being domain joined), we are only using Azure AD and have no on-prem infrastructure besides our test environment.
 We would like to have 2FA authentication and in the best case a SSO with our azure credentials, does anyone have a recommendation or idea on how to get the app proxy working without having a on-prem ad?
 On the test environment we have various labs with their own domain for product testing and training.

                              <span>Had an issue I could not figure out the answer to, so I thought it would share it here: 
 I&#x27;m creating a custom Windows 10 image in an Amazon-hosted VDI solution called WorkSpaces. 
 We noticed, after cleaning up the image, we ended up inadvertently removing the Windows 10 Store Photo.App. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t connect back to the Windows Store to just reinstall it, so I was trying to install the Photo.App via a DISM command: 
 dism /online /addappxpackpage /packpagepath: /xxxxxx /skiplicense /dependancypackage: xxxxxx , where xxxxxx is the name of the package. 
 I could not find the specific name of the Windows 10 Photo.App package unfortunately. 
 Anyone else had any luck manually reinstalling the Windows Photo.App?

 Water in a DC can never be good...
  
Description: Water intrusion in europe-west9-a has caused a multi-cluster failure and has led to an emergency shutdown of multiple zones. We expect general unavailability of the europe-west9 region. There is no current ETA for recovery of operations in the europe-west9 region at this time, but it is expected to be an extended outage. Customers are advised to failover to other regions if they are impacted.

                              <span>Straight forward process:
  
You send the group a meeting request
  
 You have to say who you want in the meeting
 You have to have an agenda
 You have to justify WHY you need each person. Saying they report to &quot;so and so&quot; is NOT a reason.
  
When the meeting group gets the request they will vet it and see if your meeting is actually needed. If it isn&#x27;t, then they will state the reason why and alternatives that you can do to get the result you need without having a meeting. EVERYONE is subjected to this - even the CEO
 If you try to go around them and host a meeting without their consent - you get sent to HR and they will handle things. You could lose the right to host a meeting, get written up, get a warning or even you could lose your job over this. This includes getting someone else to host the meeting for you when you have been told you are not allowed to host a meeting.
 After the meeting, ALL the folks who attended will be sent a survey to grade the meeting. This is used by the meeting group to grade the host. If the host keeps getting low scores, they are sent to training on how to host a meeting correctly. If they keep getting low scores after that, they are banned from hosting meetings.
 Meetings are by far the worst money waster in a company. Imagine how much could be done if pointless meetings could be eliminated.

 In this configuration, it will not activate as it is no longer on OEM hardware. Is it possible to buy a new license to and activate the ROK image in a VM with a new key? I also have two Server 2012 R2 VMs, currently running on the exiting 2012 installation. They are again on the ROK license.
 So far the only response I&#x27;ve got from UK resellers is that this is not possible. Are they right?
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I need your help again.
 I have RDS server with Windows Server 2016. Is there a way to deactivate the &quot;Updates are available&quot; popup, so that users don&#x27;t see it?
 Things I have already tried:
  
Set the GPO &quot;Allow non-administrators to receive update notifications&quot; beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to disabled (not supported for Windows 10 and so I assume also Server 2016)
 Set the GPO &quot;Remove access to use all Windows Update features&quot; beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to enabled (valid for Server 2016)
 The same GPO beneath User Configuration set to Enabled and &quot;Configure notifications:&quot; set to &quot;0 - Do not show any notifications&quot; (not supported on Windows 10)
  
Is disabling automatic updates the only solution to this problem? (not tested yet)
 How did you implement this? Any idea is appreciated.

 Is there a better way to do it? I don&#x27;t want to restrict sharing completely as we do need to add guests but only want the site owners to do it.

                              <span>Hi folks, need some help solving a stupid but necessary problem at work.
 Our auditors require us to capture evidence of the configuration of our Linux and Unix servers. That could mean capturing the contents of a config file or the output of a command like netstat. Capturing the outputs into a text file would be trivial and easy to script but the auditors are absolutely convinced that these files would be too easy to fake and demand that we capture screenshots instead (yes, I am well aware that screenshots would also be trivial to fake but the only other option is literally have the auditors sit next to us while we page through lines of output and no, I&#x27;m not kidding).
 For context, we are using Windows laptops to connect to various Linux and Unix servers.
 The perfect solution would be a…</span>

 Although the product works for our use case, the level of end user involvement to set up a meeting is a huge deterrent and users have flat out avoided it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Hoping to get some help with my current policy configuration.
 Basically, MFA is enforced (enrolment required and security info registration locked-down to trusted network) but I can&#x27;t seem to get SIF working on Wi-Fi and I&#x27;m prompted immediately when disconnecting from ethernet.
 SIF is the only session control enabled on the &quot;MFA Enforced&quot; policy but not sure why I&#x27;m still being prompted after disconnecting from LAN (trusted location). SIF is set to 60 days and I can sign-in again (going through the standard MFA process, also not seeing the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask again&quot; option which is a good sign) but I&#x27;ll get prompted for MFA again if I join and then leave the LAN same day.
 Wi-Fi public IP is shared with other tenancies in the building so I won&#x27;t add that to trusted locations but I&#x27;d still like SIF to apply regardless of location.
 Been scouring forums but can&#x27;t find cases where they&#x27;re configuring for trusted locations.
 TL;DR - No MFA prompt when on trusted network, MFA prompt immediately when not on trusted network even though SIF is set to 60 days.
 TIA

                              <span>Hi guys
 Hope someone can help us out as we have made a terrible mistake in our team.
 We have a task for every 3 months to reset the krbtgt password twice inside our domain. Normally we would do this like recommended to wait for 24h before doing the second reset and then go our ways until the 3 months mark has been reached. Never had a problem for years. Now today it happened. I reset the password yesterday in the evening and scheduled the second reset for tomorrow as there normally would be no harm to do that even a day afterwards as long as we wait said 24. well what happened. The second admin new to our environment started the second reset this morning thinking that I did not do the first reset today in the morning and now we cannot access our DCs, nor any other server which only allows admin access to them. 
 I saw that one would need to restart every server and afterwards all clients which connect to the domain. Is this true? Or should we already plan for the a recovery plan? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a user whos Outlook crashes when printing email. Only some emails, and the example I was shown this morning is fairly long chain with some screenshots in it. She got her collegue to print it and it worked fine. But her&#x27;s, once the print window appears, that&#x27;s it, print preview is blank, it says connecting to printer but it&#x27;s frozen.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Changing default printer
 Saving attachment to desktop and opening and printing from there
 Outlook in safe mode
 Enabling IE mode in Edge
 Making sure .mht is associated with Edge
 Online Office repair
 Made sure Outlook trust settings aren&#x27;t set to automatically download
 Removing the outlprnt file
  
None of the above made anyu difference. 
 I did try it from OWA, when I opened the email, hit print, it came straight up fine. Then I noticed it was blocking some content, so I allowed that, hit print, it took about 30sec for the print window to load but it did then work fine. 
 I&#x27;m thinking broken link or something like that, but I&#x27;m not sure what else to try?

                              <span>How do you go about preparing systems, if they involve accounts that use an Authenticator app?
 We often set up new systems with all fine details and settings on our own, which are then shipped to the end user so that they can get right back to work with their new system.
 In the past the users gave us their current passwords once and changed it after the work was done. 
 Now Microsoft 365 requires a 2FA on the basis of an authentication app (Microsoft or third-party), which means that we have to go to the user every time we need to sign in, so that they can give us the necessary PINs. 
 Since Microsoft 365 requires a new login quite frequently during setup, it can then happen that we have to keep pestering the users over 1-3 days, our work gets held up if we can&#x27;t reach them, etc.
 Have you found a solution and a reasonable workflow for this?

                              <span>We are way too late, I know. It&#x27;s not up to me.
 There are still two 2008R2 in use, which I want to migrate to 2022 with the Storage Migration Service.
 This does not work because the Powershell version is too low. So I have to install the Windows Management Framework first. As soon as I install the update and then restart the server, the update fails and is undone. In the event logs I get the error code 80070661 and I can&#x27;t find a solution on the net.
 Could it be because we don&#x27;t have Extended Security Updates for 2008R2 servers? 
 Do you have any other idea how I can solve this problem?

                              <span>We have a client that we have to turn on/off email forwarding for specific users, when they are on vacation etc.
 On Exchange online you can just turn it on and off manually. Idea is that i want to make it less of a chore and automate this. For example turn on forwarding emails from user1 to user2 from datetime1 to datetime2.
 Idea is to use scheduler on server and run two scripts. One for turning on and one for turning off. Maybe some kind of gui that create two scripts base on use input and after the second script run, both tasks are deleted?
 Any idea how to proceed with this?

                              <span>I have at home ssh server (no-ip, internal nat, ssh key). I can connect to it via phone and laptop from anywhere. But only when I am on company VPN or on office network, I get &quot;No gssapi security context available&quot; as last event in putty. I see IP and SSH info in event log, so I can connect, just it stops by gssapi. Similar on connectbot from phone when on company wifi network.
 Do you have some recommendation how to mitigate this? Probably some company policy with putty or ssh. I have at home 3D printer and would not like to observe it via phone&#x27;s data and similar for home events.

 opensource is fine, also payed but it needs to be some kind of trial so i can test it and show it off to the rest of the staff.
 What say yee? Suggestions are welcome :)

                              <span>It&#x27;s discouraging to encounter insecure people who belittle others in the workplace. But focus on the work, maintain positivity, and break the cycle by teaching others the right way. Remember that there are many great people in the IT field, and retaliation only perpetuates the negativity. Keep pushing forward, and eventually, you&#x27;ll gain their respect and prove your worth.

                              <span>I posted this question 5 years ago. Looking to see how answers have changed.
 IPv6 was published as a standard in December 1998. With the 30th anniversary approaching, what has shaken out to be the most accepted way of assigning Addresses in an enterprise environment? 
  
SLAAC + RDNSS
 SLAAC with DHCPv6 for for Domain info
 DHCPv6 with SLAAC only for RA
  
(Yes, I know that Android is still not on the DHCPv6 train, but Windows is on the RDNSS train now, so major changes have happened in the last 5 years.)
 I know the NSA has published a document this January with the following:
 &quot;NSA recommends assigning addresses to hosts via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) server to mitigate the SLAAC privacy issue. Alternatively, this issue can also be mitigated by using a randomly generated interface ID (RFC 4941 – Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Auto-configuration in IPv6) [1] that changes over time, making it difficult to correlate activity while still allowing network defenders requisite visibility &quot; 
 So how are you guys handling address assignment?

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeing an EX4300 add its own option 82 field to discovers with one already present, which is causing issues. I&#x27;ve skimmed the RFCs, and I haven&#x27;t found anything one way or another on whether this is permissible or forbidden (rfc3046 says a relay agent does not add a second relay agent option, but nothing about a second bridge). My expectation is that this should never happen, but at least JTAC seems to think this is fine, despite inconsistent behavior as a result of this. Has anyone else encountered anything like this?

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;m trying to develop a proof of concept for something and it begins with using a virtual Sonicwall Nv270 hosted in azure, and creating an IPSec VPN tunnel interface between the NSv and a remote site.
 I created this VM in line with the Sonicwall best practice which includes using the Marketplace template to stand it up.
 The remote site in question is a Cradlepoint IBR900 Cellular router. We&#x27;ve used a lot of these devices in other deployments - Including - Scenarios where we&#x27;ve deployed physical Sonicwalls in customer data centers and had IPsec tunnels to between them.
 The Azure VM is running Linux CentOS and it has a Public IP which is then bound to the virtual network WAN interface X1 which also has a private IP. 
 The Sonicwall isn&#x27;t aware if it&#x27;s Public IP - The WAN Interface X1 has an IP of 10.1.0.4 and sends traffic out the internet to its DFGW of 10.1.0.1 - I cannot change the WAN Interface IP nor the DFGW which I find really odd. 
 I have by default an NSG inside Azure which I&#x27;ve setup to allow traffic sourced from the Cradlepoint&#x27;s public IP on ports 50, 51, 500 and 4500.
 I have created on both the sonicwall and the cradlepoint, a VTI and triple checked all of the configuration for Phase 1 and Phase 2 to ensure it matches.
 On the Sonicwall, I can see traffic coming from the CP on it&#x27;s public IP on the allowed ports and the reverse leaving the firewall.
 I do not have an Azure VPN Gateway set up - I wanted to set this up without it if it&#x27;s possible due to some limitations with it.
 I&#x27;m quite green with Azure so I&#x27;m trying my best to get something basic working but having difficulties. If you need further information, please let me know.

Can someone please explain why do we need NSX if ACI provides both underlay and overlay networks. I understand that NSX has distributed FW and other features but what else does it solve when you already have ACI that provides L2 extension. Why do we need double overlays?

                              <span>We (a mid-sized ISP) have moved to Nokia 7750 as an edge router. Everything is working great, but until we get our second edge set up, we need to have 2 Google BGP peers on the one router. If I turn them both on, I get asynchronous routing and it causes all kinds of problems. How can I have one set up as a secondary, that only takes accepts prefixes if the main peer goes down? I didn&#x27;t see any kind of option like in the Nokia CLI. I&#x27;m used to Ericsson routers, and they have a multiple-peers with same AS option. TIA!

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;ve noticed that large public Wi-Fi networks tend to have an IP configuration similar to this:
 Network: aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/30 (I&#x27;ve seen segments from 28 to 30)
 Gateway: aaa.bbb.ccc.1 (default gateway is in any IP from segment 23)
 I just wanted to ask if anyone of you have deployed large campus wi-fi networks and know why this is the case. I have some theories of my own:
  
Helps with client isolation.
 Helps with bandwidth management, where you assign certain bandwidth capacity to each subnet.
 ??? (I just don&#x27;t know what else could be the cause of this).

                              <span>I have a Dell/Force10 S4810 VLT pair that are functioning as core routers with a collection of VLANs and static routes. I&#x27;m in the process of setting up BGP. Should I have the 4810s peer with each other (such as loopback), or does the VLT make that not necessary?

                              <span>Haven&#x27;t touched Comware7 switches much, but the few times I did I would struggle to get Radius working for authentication via NPS. There&#x27;s a few articles out there but somehow I still always had issues like NPS sending Access-Accept, switch logs showing successful login, but it would immediately disconnect me.
 This time I decided to document what I learned so that others might benefit.. i.e me in a few years when I forget again :)
 Switch config:
 ssh server enable radius scheme NPS primary authentication 1.2.3.4 primary accounting 1.2.3.4 key authentication simple MY-PSK-HERE key accounting simple MY-PSK-HERE user-name-format without-domain domain MYDOMAIN authentication login radius-scheme NPS local authorization login radius-scheme NPS local accounting login radius-scheme NPS local domain default enable MYDOMAIN line vty 0 63 authentication-mode scheme user-role network-admin user-role network-operator protocol inbound ssh idle-timeout 600 0 
 NPS
 --Network Policies ----Constraints ------Authentication Methods Uncheck all except for PAP. PAP required. ----Settings ------Vendor Specific Add an attribute &quot;Cisco-AV-Pair&quot; Add attribute value and enter &quot; shell:roles&#x3D;network-admin &quot; 
 Obviously this is not a complete guide. This assumes you know how to set up NPS/radius generally. This is just the hang ups.

 ​
 Problem is I never worked with Catalysts before, and only OS upgrade I&#x27;ve done (1-2 year ago) were on Nexus. I dont really work on anything else apart from ACI nowadays :C
 ​
 Can someone get me through the commands?I guess I&#x27;ll have to transfer the new image file to the switch via tftp, and thats it. I don&#x27;t know anything about boot load orders, confregs, or any of that.
 ​
 Plz help!

                              <span>Hi,
 thinking about source address persistence in BigIP, but couln&#x27;t find any limits/recomendation.
 The question is, if the timeout in source address persistence profile is set relatively high (for example 8 hours ) how crticial can this become regarding to memory of the BigIP.
 If there are for example 1M entries (for 1M different source IPs) in the persistent table, does this effect perfomance ?
 Already tried &#x27;tmsh show sys memory | grep -i &quot;subsystem\|persist&quot;&#x27; but thats not realy helpful.

                              <span>As my title states. When you have a HA Firewall set to Active-Passive, the passive firewall only comes online in the event of a failure of some sort, even if the active firewall is running at full capacity. Meaning one should configure for Active-Active if you want to achieve load balancing capabilities and reduce latency during high levels of utilization, is my understanding correct?

 My question was basically that does the firewall software limit users to 20 or is it unlimited but the company advertises it as 20 for declared performance? ( even if performance drops with more users it would not affect my 100Mbps right??)

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am having bandwidth issues and after many tests I am now clueless so I&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ll come up with fresh ideas...
 So here&#x27;s the main issue : using the VPN from home, we have a download speed of 1.5MB/s which is low given the VPN concentrator and infrastructure we have (from the office using the VPN, the download speed is ~30MB/s).
 But this low speed is mainly due to the link/path speed which is low even without using a VPN (8Mo/s). But I can&#x27;t understand why I can only reach 8Mo/s on this link (downloading a file from home to the office WITHOUT VPN).
 What I can&#x27;t explain is that the upload speed from the office to a Cloud Server (mega.nz or weTransfer) uses almost the same path but the upload speed is much better ~20+MB/s (and speedtest.net shows ~500Mbps).
 Here&#x27;s a recap of all the tests I have done so far (no VPN). Know that the speed tests were done with 2 different devices to be sure it&#x27;s not device related (2 file servers, 2 home office computers in different locations, etc..).
 My only guess so far is that it could be due to MTU / packet fragmentation but I don&#x27;t see where would this fragmentation happen. Could they have different policies depending on the flow type (TCP established)? That would explain why Office -&gt; Internet upload speed and Internet -&gt; Office download speed (&#x3D; same flow source / direction) are different but I don&#x27;t see why they would do that?
 Thanks in advance and have a great day!

                              <span>Hi All.
 We&#x27;ve got a BGP with our Plubic AS peering with two Tier 1 providers. (Telia and Cogent)
 The issue I&#x27;m having is that customers using Zayo here in the US are getting latency over 40ms. We&#x27;re based in NYC and our traffic is routed to Atlanta via Zayo, if I use the Zayo looking glass to find our IP, I can confirm it&#x27;s going to Atlanta. Neither of my ISPs can do anything about it.
 I tried reporting Zayo, but no luck. When I ping my office using Altice, the time is fine, but if I ping a Zayo customer or vice versa, it&#x27;s not. Both providers give me the default route.
 Do you guys have any ideas on what to do?

                              <span>Okay im trying to downgrade the firmware on my 7841 cisco ip phones. All I have to work with is a laptop and single router, a pacstar 447 and no Internet. I copied the firmware from a USB to the routers flash, I then configured dhcp. Cme and sip, a voice vlan and interfaces. I configured the port the phone is connecting to as a trunk because it wasn&#x27;t letting me ping the phone unless I did so. When I look in the phones settings it shows it has an ip given from the dhcp I set up, it shows the tftp server ip that I set on the router and it shows the routers domain name and hostname, and the routers ip, it shows that there is no codec on the phone and in the status when I reboot or factory reset the phone it shows dns no ip, so I tried configuring that but it still doesn&#x27;t show up. And when I do the upgrade command or create profile command is says error deleted flash:/ then some weird file name that doesn&#x27;t exist on the router. My supervisor said not to worry about it. Any ideas of what I could be missing? Also before I made it a trunk port the phone would say tftp timed out but now it has the dns thing which confuses me because we&#x27;re not trying to pull anything from a dns and we have all it needs on the router.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been a Barracuda Backup shop for years now. Regulations require holding onto stuff for a long time, and as I inherited it, and it was working, I left it alone. I started down the Veeam Backup path about 3 years ago as a more rich feature set, as well as a secondary backup system. Just got my Barracuda renewal quote and its a 200% rate increase. Its seriously making me consider that its time to throw in the towel and walk away. Anyone have experience trying to get legacy info out of Barracudas and imported into Veeam? Only idea I have at the minute is to restore the yearlies as a VM, then have Veeam back that up. Just take a point in time from every year. Thanks in advance.

 Going to this site shows a cert issue and you&#x27;re quickly re-directed. Seems like an MS Issue, but I can&#x27;t confirm obviously.

                              <span>We urgently need one and I have what I assume is an age-old question.
 How on earth do you find the time to keep it meaningful? You&#x27;d have to come awful close to an exact clone of production and keep it separate yet synchronized. That strikes me as being a full time job for not just one guy but a team of guys.
 I&#x27;d love to hear what you folks are doing.

                              <span>I apologize that this isn&#x27;t necessarily the right sub but wondering if anyone in here can recommend me a quiet mouse.
 Short story is we have what I like to call a rage clicker - the user is fine but he punishes his mouse to the point people sitting near him complain - more than once lol. I&#x27;m after something that is reasonably quiet compared to your bog standard HP mouse that can also withstand button smashing...
 There are a few on the market but I need to know whatever we get will hold up :/
 Edit for context: in Australia (g&#x27;day cobbers)
