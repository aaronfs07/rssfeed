                              <span>Hi guys,
 Since the current translated subtitles in teams are not up to professional standards (misinterpreting company names and stuff) I’ve been looking into better working alternatives.
 I haven’t been able to find anything really, azure cognitive services seemed cool but damn, that’s a whole rabbithole 
 Does anyone have an idea? 
 It needs to be translated live and be displayed somewhat accurately. Or is the built-in teams version the best I’ll get?
 Thanks 😀

                              <span>So I inherited my current Sysadmin role for a small company and they relied on the built-in Microsoft defender for their AV protection. I&#x27;ve always use a 3rd party like Kaspersky endpoint security or ESET NOD32. What are y&#x27;alls experience with only relying on Microsoft defender, is it enough?

                              <span>Original post
 Box and Synology are still working on the issue, and I believe are in some sort on dialogue.
 Synology developers posted in the Box Forum.
 Expanding on the behaviour they noticed, I played with the API url from the CloudSync authentication popup and worked out that modifying the &amp;state parameter to html-encode http:// to http%3A%2F%2F solves the problem. The modified URL needs to be loaded from the pop-up window, not from a different browser window, so a little console trickery is needed...
 Below are the steps to replicate my workaround: 
  
Open CloudSync
 Click the + icon to create a new link
 Select Box and click Next
 The popup authentication window appears (with the 403 Forbidden error)
 Copy the entire URL
 Pressed Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up the Browser Developer Tools
 Switch to the console tab
 Type the following into the console (note the single apostrophe at the end):
 self.location &#x3D; ‘
 Paste the URL copied in step 5
 Locate &amp;state&#x3D;http://x.x.x.x:5000 at the end of the URL and change it to:
 &amp;state&#x3D;http%3A%2F%2Fx.x.x.x:5000 (i.e. replacing the first : with %3A and each / with %2F. Don’t change anything else)
 Type a closing ’
 Press enter
 The Box authentication window should appear and you should be able to grant permission successfully.
 
 My sync is up and running after 8 days and lots of inconvenience.
 And now we wait for an official fix!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been patching Chrome and Firefox via SCCM for quite some time now and more recently started using Tenable security scanning. Tenable has been finding Chrome and Firefox installs in the C:\Users space which SCCM has not been targetting. The collections I have only find Chrome/Firefox in Program Files that SCCM itself would have deployed. I have now created some Configuration items to locate these user installs and I want to convert these to the enterprise browser versions. My issue is how do I handle bookmarks? If I uninstall the browser from the C:\User they will lose their bookmarks. I&#x27;ve been researching how to backup bookmarks and restore them in an automated way but I haven&#x27;t found a great answer. Has anyone else gone through this?

Every so often i run the “Unavailable Computers” query in log analytics to check up on the mma agent availability but i cannot get the email alerting to work. When i turn this query into an alert rule the preview shows 0 and no emails work. Suggestions?
 How is everyone monitoring these agents for disconnects or faulty services on the server?

 I&#x27;m relatively new to it, but we have reports generated for us which contain machines that have some issues. 
 How often does D365 perform a software inventory on devices? What is the initial or interval period?
 Is there a way to check when it was last conducted?
 How long does that device information stay in D365?
 Many thanks to anyone that can provide some advice or guidance

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Heyho everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently in the planing phase for the replacement of a lot older thinclients in a warehouse enviroment. For the last 10-12 years the company went the way of buying refurbished/cheap used devices to replace the faulty ones since &quot;they are just thin clients&quot;. In the last 2 years of support for them, we had like 3 or 4 devices that failed. To be fair, some were straight up old and gave up mostly because of that, however the others suffered from enviromental problems. A warehouse is full of various kinds of dirt &amp; dust in the air that settles down everywhere. Employees touch things with dirty hands and so on.
 ​
 I thought it might be better to instead replace most TCs now with some higher quality devices (and switch at that time over to Igel OS) that last longer because they are designed for that enviroment. The devices mostly potray some old software, nothing newer that could push the hardware requirements. Some raspberry Pis could probably do the job ..
 ​
 So yeah .. Any recommendations?

                              <span>I consider myself a decent programmer, but unfortunately, I lack experience in server administration and maintaining a production environment. Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve developed a web app that I want to bring live for field testing purposes. I&#x27;ve already set up a virtual server at Hetzner.com with a firewall and other security measures, such as disabling password logins.
 My application consists of:
  
NestJs/NodeJs backend
 Vue.js SPA frontend, which can be served by NestJs but also deployed independently
 Redis
 MongoDB
  
My plan is to run all of these components on a single virtual server for the testing phase (and as long as it is sufficient). I think I&#x27;ll use Docker for this setup.
 Do you have any suggestions/tips regarding this setup or thoughts on issues I may have missed? For example, regarding:
  
Logging and monitoring
 Do you recommend Docker for this setup?
 Any security measures I may have missed?
 Should I include Nginx as a reverse proxy, and why?
  
As I said this is my first own live environment and I&#x27;d really appreciate any suggestions and help.

 i am wondering if anyone has got this figured.
 We would like to use Roaming Profiles with Google Cloud Sync, currently the user needs to do this every now and again and with Mandatory Profiles they need to enable turn on sync every time. 
 The only way around this would be to change the location of chrome files which only allows one instance of chrome which does not work in our environment.
 i have enabled the policy for the new azure sync settings as well as signing on which works but does not turn on cloud sync that goes through another popup.
 i am wondering if anyone has any ideas how i can turn on Cloud Sync without user intervention or any policies or reg tweaks, any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, 
 We&#x27;re making our super-late upgrade from Exchange 2010 to 2016 (and after that to 2019), after inheriting an old environment and finding out updates not working. 
 After installing Exchange 2016 on a new server, we&#x27;ve ran into issues with migrating mailboxes: &quot;Unsupported source mailbox version Version 14.0 ‎(Build 639.0)‎.&quot;
 That version should stand for Exchange 2010 RTM. The 2010 server itself is supposed to be patched. 
 What I&#x27;ve checked:
 - In the EMC the server version shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot; - EMC is said to be inaccurate: Application binary versions (checked from the running store.exe location, no second wrong install locations) are 14.3.513.0, which should be the very last rollup of SP3
 - Get-ExchangeServer AdminDisplayVersion also shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot;
 - The current Exchange schema version is rangeUpper 15332 (or Exchange 2016 CU18)
 - The &quot;Exchange Servers&quot; AD group only contains current running (the 2010 and 2016) servers
 - In ADSIEdit, Configuration/Services/Microsoft Exchange/[domain]/Administrative Groups/Exchange Administrative Group (...)/Servers also only contains the current running servers
 What I&#x27;ve tried:
 - First, most of the instructions that were followed are from the Exchange Deployment Assistant
 - Trying to run the upgraded installer for 2010 just to be sure but it says nothing to upgrade
 - Searching for any non-installed updates through Windows update, including hidden ones - Restarted services and machines so no lingering processes should exist
 - Creating a new database on the 2010 server and moving mailboxes to it in case the database has an affected version as well 
 Misc:
 - We currently do not intend to move to Exchange Online
 My current understanding would be that mailboxes also have a version and have to be upgraded. How do I go about doing that? Otherwise, what issue am I not seeing?

 This leaves me and one other Snr Engineer as the sole people in our large Org with the &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;. Eg all the top level access.
 At what point do you trust a new boss with this? Normally with a new peer you would gradually provide more access as it was warranted and you trusted them more. With a boss, that dynmac is quite different.

 It’s a control box running on my local network. I am trying to use a tunnel to log into it which works as I get the webpage looking for me to log in when i am out and about with my laptop
 I enter the details, and it logs me in but it’s only in “Read Only” mode
 When I log in locally, it logs me in with read / write and I can do the usual.
 I am logging in with the same administrator account with both through the tunnel and locally.
 Did any of you guys ever experience this with your tunnels and web admin panels? Is there some configuration settings that I might have missed in the setup in CloudFlare?

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid thirties and I&#x27;ve just finished being self employed for nearly eleven years. The job I did involved a lot of use of technology, from commissioning and deploying web apps, to building some little internal windows app of my own in autohotkey, to BEING the entire IT department for my small company...
 I&#x27;m ready to work hard and in a dedicated way - but this time for someone else.
 I&#x27;ve done all sorts of different things. I&#x27;m REALLY interested in technology and have been tinkering since I was about ten!
 I have used all sorts of systems over the years from Acorns at secondary school to CentOS now at home (in a homelab type setting). I&#x27;ve provided IT support for paying business/private customers, and have used Unix systems to cobble together working solutions for my own needs as and when.
 I&#x27;ve created/configured/used (these are examples) Asterisk (FreePBX), NodeRed, ESP32 microcontrollers, AutoHotkey, Home Assistant (writing the automations in YAML), Docker, Photoshop, MQTT, Excel.... I have some limited experience with tools such as Cron, SSH, I used to make websites for clients 20 years ago but wouldn&#x27;t have a clue what the in vogue framework is now...
 My IT skills are perhaps beyond 1st line tech support I&#x27;d say (tell me if you disagree!).
 I have an IT related master&#x27;s qualification - but it&#x27;s a few years out of date now, due to the time I&#x27;ve had &#x27;out&#x27; running my own business.
 I&#x27;d need to find somewhere that was willing to take a chance on a quick learner with a MASSIVE interest in tech and a track record of tinkering and experimenting, iterating and building projects.
 Any ideas where to start looking?
 Working remote is absolutely fine for me as I have a garden office at the end of the garden where I can go and just focus for the working day. No distractions.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking for advice, tips, leads at this point. Where should I be looking and how should I be tailoring my CV to (ideally) pivoting towards tech?
 THANK YOU!

                              <span>Our Mac print server recently died (the Mac mini would no longer successfully boot up) so we hurriedly set up a new one with Monterey and the latest Epson print drivers. Individually the printers all work fine but our follow-me print queue just produced a blank page on certain models (we have a mix of WF-C579R WF-C879R and WF-C20600). We raised the issue with PaperCut and they were able to quickly highlight that the cause is that the drivers are outputting ESCP instead of Postscript. 
 I know there&#x27;s a &quot;Generic Postscript&quot; driver on macOS but it&#x27;s my understanding that if we use this we lose access to printer features such as colour profiles, which are important as our Mac users are primarily Art &amp; Photography. 
 Is there a way to configure the Epson print driver on macOS to use / output Postscript?

 Apologies in advance if this is the worst post of the day, but I&#x27;m hoping my sysadmin family of Microsoft experts can help me as I&#x27;m a bit lost.
 Personally, I&#x27;m a Mac admin in a Google workspace environment with comparatively little knowledge of Office 365 other than creating users and licenses in our Office 365 instance for the small number of our team that can only to communicate with clients via Teams/OneDrive etc due to their security requirements.
 I have had a request through from a client to “make sure the external company adds Federation to the following SIP domains…” This in order to facilitate comms over Teams from our company to theirs, rather than the current clunky setup of client VMS / VPN.
 However I can’t find what I’m supposed to be looking for in the admin portal. Google searching tells me it&#x27;s something to do with some settings on our on-prem Skype server, but we obviously don’t have one of those, but that could also be because I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m searching for.
 If anyone has a couple of minutes to point me in the right direction I&#x27;d be super grateful

                              <span>I’m an IT tech and I recently did a project where we connected two switches together that are in separate buildings - about a mile apart. We used single mode fiber all the way through and installed a second line as a secondary. This was pre existing fiber infrastructure, I just patched things into the adjacent dark fiber patch panels to get from point A to point B. The second building is a new building and the patch panels are new. 
 I’m not very well versed in fiber and such but I did do a ping test from switch to switch and got under 1ms responses which I thought was all good. Now Network team conducted a TX/RX optical power test from the switches and found that we’re losing about -10db on the run on both lines and both ways. So right now our RX on both switches is around -13 to -16 db. So my question is, is this normal or is something seriously wrong and what is most likely the cause? The network team is making a big deal out of it and actively trying to make me look like I screwed up their network so I’m not sure how to respond. 
 Any advice appreciated.

 Obviously it&#x27;s Chunkhost and I&#x27;m not expecting an immediate response, but a week is ridiculous. Has anyone been able to reach them? It&#x27;s not a critical server or anything (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t host anything critical with them), but I am paying for a server that&#x27;s currently down and that&#x27;s not ok.
 Alternatively, if anyone has any suggestions for reaching someone over there, I would appreciate it.

Curious what people&#x27;s thoughts are if anybody&#x27;s evaluated them. Also curious how they compare to Crowdstrike&#x27;s IDP module, Authlite, Duo, &amp; smart cards? Seems good (also maybe more coverage than Duo across powershell &amp; psexec) but a bit pricey...

                              <span>I have a folder on a file server(2019) that is shared with some information for an application that a vendor states we should limit user access to as much as possible. So for share permissions I have Everyone full control. For the NTFS permissions I have SYSTEM(FULL), LOCAL ADMINS(FULL), and DOMAIN COMPUTERS(READ). The LOCAL ADMINS group on the file server has domain admins inside of it. Everything is working fine and the application inside of it is being deployed without issue while at the same time no users have any access to the folder except DOMAIN ADMINS.
 Now the strange thing is if I&#x27;m on the file server with my domain admin account and I try to open the folder by either the filesystem or the share I get prompted with the message &quot;You don&#x27;t currently have permissions to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to the folder.&quot; Remember the local admins on the file server has the domain admins in the group. Not sure why it&#x27;s telling me I don&#x27;t have access. Now if I click continue it adds my DA account to the NTFS permissions explicitly. This is screwing up our folder permissions consistency. If I didn&#x27;t truly have access as the message stated how did it explicitly add my DA account with full control? That seems kind of messed up if that was really the case.
 One final note. If I&#x27;m on my office machine and run computer management as my DA connecting the file server and then navigate to the shares, when opening the folder I don&#x27;t get prompted with the message above. If I look at the NTFS permissions everything is correct. WTF? I have to say I&#x27;m confused by this one. I would imagine opening the folder on the file system on the server would be the sure fire way to get in, but remotely accessing it resolves the issue?
 Can anyone explain what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>Hi all, I believe I won&#x27;t be the first one to face this issue but I could not find any answers on the internet. 
 In our company we own about 12 domains, for those domains we have about 20+ SSL certificates (top level, subdomains, wildcard, etc) that are used for services like customer-facing websites, internal ERP systems, teamsconnector, load-balancers in cloud services etc. 
 Those cerficates all expire in different months and it is so hard to keep track of the expiry date, make sure they are renewed, and most importantly-- make sure that the new certificate are sent to the vendor and they update the certificate in time. 
 We have a few occassions when the renewal is missed by internal IT stuff, or the renewed certificate is sent to the vendor but they sit on it until the website goes down.
 Is there any suggestions for how to manage that?

                              <span>I am playing catch-up from the last admin. Freshly documenting everything to a spreadsheet for me. It is not for C-Suite, VPs or Directors to review. I am constantly being asked to send spreadsheets I&#x27;ve made for me, to a VP that should&#x27;ve documented theirselves if they needed the information.
 As per usual at the time, I used to send VP my spreadsheet because &quot;they said to&quot;, then they would subject me to all sorts of suggestions and changes and additions that would make the data kindergarten level understandable(colors, bold, &#x27;move this column here&#x27;, &#x27;add this column for that data&#x27;...etc), to them, but unnecessary if you actually read the information. I already have the bolds, underlines and colors necessary...FOR ME. I have now stopped (stopped sending my documentation, it is on our NAS, only I can edit it. They can read it) since realizing that not sending that data bears no consequences. It&#x27;s a small enough company that anyone in our IT realm could&#x27;ve done this and can do this. This VP also makes it a habit of taking other individuals&#x27; ideas and passing them as their own publicly.
 Has anyone else had an issue where once a VP/Dir knows that you have information useful to them(that they never thought would be before they knew you had it), they commandeer the format of your notes so that it suddenly becomes an involuntary collaborative effort?

There are fiber to Ethernet converters everywhere. The cabling in some of the buildings is thrown together, he had a main connection running through an old t1 punchdown block. It&#x27;s kind of fun figuring and straightening all this out though.

                              <span>Preface - I own a tech shop but we&#x27;re on the hardware side of things.
 I&#x27;m trying to set a client up with Tailscale and RDP so he can securely connect to his office machine and operate quickbooks and all his other software(CPA) through remote desktop. I&#x27;ve got Tailscale set up and working correctly. The problem I&#x27;m running into is authenticating the RDP session. If I open RDC on the client computer and enter the computer name of the host, it brings up an authentication dialogue. He&#x27;s using a 365 account so it&#x27;s already populated, and simply asks for the password. I know I&#x27;m entering it correctly and I&#x27;ve tried multiple times but it&#x27;s reporting the password incorrect. 
 So his MS account is &#x27;firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27;. RDC shows the login as a Microsoft Account &#x27;/firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27; so I&#x27;m just not seeing the problem here. We have good connectivity obviously as I mis-entered the computer name a couple times and it reported not finding any computers with that name on the network. I&#x27;m already home from my service call to his office but I told him I&#x27;d get to the bottom of it and remote in to make whichever changes deemed necessary by the powers that be - r/sysadmin
 send help.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I made a script to validate MFA on users accounts in Azure AD using the Graph API. It checks if the account is registered with the Microsoft Authenticator app or any 3rd party authenticator app. If the account hasn&#x27;t enabled MFA it will flag them with a date using custom security attributes, and in 7 days if they haven&#x27;t registered MFA it will disable their account. 
 ​
 Just to note I have this disabling the users on-premises account since we&#x27;re assuming they&#x27;re synced users from AD. You can always adjust the script to meet your needs as I have a function in there to disable the users Azure AD account but you will need to stop syncing the accountEnabled attribute in AAD Connect.

                              <span>I know this is an absurd question, but specifically to the sysadmins that are one running the whole show - is it common or did you ever encountered users that engaged in flirting to get you to put them in your priority/preference list? Is this something that happens? At times I felt this happened to me but it confused me greatly if this is common?
 Sorry for the dumb question I just want to know if some users do that, especially the attractive ones that might be used to getting things that way.

                              <span>Hi, this is my first post here, but I&#x27;ve been a lurker for a few months now.
 I work for a very small company. We have 5 employees, including the owner. I work remotely and the rest work in the office. We have a guy who got our Windows server setup about 2 years ago, along with the networking infrastructure in the office. The server is used to store our working files, and to allow us to access it remotely through a program called Centrestack. We have multiple backups going, one of which we take off-site. And we use Avast Business for our antivirus on the server and each employee&#x27;s laptop or desktop.
 I have been the default on-site &quot;IT&quot; guy since we moved into the office. I handle setting up new computers (we had around 13 employees last year, so I had more work to handle), creating new us…</span>

 Several of our services are down and the logs show authentication failures.

                              <span>Hi /r/sysadmin 
 I&#x27;m a part-time college professor in addition to my regular role as an IT manager, and want to survey all of you to check how many enterprises in 2023 are using desktops vs laptops for employees. We have a computer hardware course, and a disagreement between a few of us professors on what the current trend is for deployed hardware to ensure our course is relevant and up to date, as this course objective is to ensure students are prepared to be technicians in the working world, likely supporting organizations and enterprises.
 My experience has been majority of enterprises and work environments nowadays are laptop based, and rarely desktop based. 
 Can I ask for your feedback on what hardware approach you have in your environments? It seems I can&#x27;t do a poll type post to get a vote, so would appreciate your thoughts as comments below.
 If you do use desktops, what kind / size / form factor? Larger towers, mini towers, SFF, Micro, etc?
 EDIT - Thank you everyone for the replies so far, I&#x27;ll endeavour to individually comment and thank each of you by replying to your comments as I have time :) It&#x27;s very much appreciated to ensure we educate our students to join the industry in the future and be well equipped with knowledge by the time they graduate

 Microsoft has decided that all these attachments are &quot;high confidence phishing&quot; and it will not let them through. We need an admin to go through them and release them. No way to bypass this filtering, no way to let users release these messages, not even a good way to see what has been released and what hasn&#x27;t (if the email is sent to a distribution and you release to one user it will show as released, even though most users didn&#x27;t get it).

 Any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right sub - and if so can you please redirect me and suggest where I should post? Anyways, I got an email when I sign up for a domain name through the company Hover. I&#x27;ve had a few issues with this company, including very slow emails sinking, and troubles with linking it to my Gmail account, but something that I find it very weird and doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is why a lot of times when I try to sign up for some thing using my email address it says that my email is invalid. For example if I go to a grocery store and try to sign up for their rewards card or something, usually it says that my email is not valid and they asked me if I spelled it right, etc. When this happens I often feel defensive like &quot;listen pal, I pay for this email address and it&#x27;s definitely legit - do you want me to prove it to you? what&#x27;s your email address? I&#x27;ll email you right now!&quot; lol. Only half joking. But seriously, why is this happening, and is there a way to fix it? I did use my email name to be [info@myname.com](mailto:info@myname.com) - so perhaps some people think it&#x27;s a fake name, and like a chump like me couldn&#x27;t possibly have such a personalized email, but is it a problem with Hover? Or is it a problem with my email settings? Or is it that the &quot;info@&quot; emails are somehow blacklisted as not personal emails, or are considered like &quot;no reply&quot; emails?

                              <span>Feel stupid asking this question but having a hard time wrapping my head around this. We had a provider wan link outage yesterday. During the outage I could not get to any internal IP based devices, ie, switches, firewall, servers, etc. I use internal dns servers on my desktop/laptop. Gateway is a layer 3 switch. I cannot via browser access the switch address which is just an ip, not any specific internal ip only devices that do not have dns names.
 I was able to ping, unc paths work. By the time I was getting ready to try ssh, etc. the wan link came back up and everything started working. This had happened one other time and at the time I didn&#x27;t think a lot of it because it was real short. I do know this was a wan link issue and not a core issue.
 I did look into my browswer setting and automatic proxy was on. Would this cause the issue? Would this still be dns (as everything is dns)? I can do some testing early mornings before office gets going to figure this out but things just don&#x27;t seem to make sense.
 Appreciate any thoughts, ideas.

I&#x27;ve tried using the Uninstall Tool, which removed a few loose versions but honestly not much that it can see. I also tried modifying the Visual Studio 2019 Installer to uncheck the Out of Support individual component boxes, but that only removed the most recent version of each version (ex. removed 5.0.17 but not 5.0.14).
 I&#x27;m at a loss of what else to do other than figure out scripting or manual removal of all the loose folders that still remain on the 300+ machines that Qualys reports with vulnerable .NET Core versions. Any ideas?

                              <span>Wondering if anyone here has purchased anything from PCLiquidations.com, and if so how did it go? Any horror stories?
 I need to find a cost effective vendor for replacement laptops for my guys out in the field. Our need isn&#x27;t enough to buy in bulk; more ad hoc purchase as my field user&#x27;s beat their laptops into oblivion.
 For context, I work in construction management.
 Thanks!

                              <span>hi i hope this is the place for this question, but i am constantly getting a &quot;access is denied&quot; error on a particular website. The site is not blocked through our firewall, and not blocked through malwarebytes. It was working a few days ago. There has been some spam email that has been cycling through our network from that website. but Any block request go through me. We arent running VPN or Proxy. and i dont think office365 would be blocking any domains. ive tried two different browsers. any one have any suggestions?
 ​
 thanks

                              <span>Hello, this is somewhat of a follow up post of my rant about a demanding user. 
 This time, It is their inbox. It is constantly filling up. We get 2-3 tickets a week from this user about her damn emails (always with that annoying red !). For information, this user works in accounting, They seem to treat their inbox as the archives for entire department. (Filled up a 50gb archive in 3 months) No one else in accounting has this issue!
 How are you folks dealing with situations like this? it seems like everywhere that I&#x27;ve worked, there is someone in accounting who clutches on to all emails like a golden egg.I am getting extremely frustrated with having to deal with this 1 persons email every other day, looking for any guidance on how to deal with this, should I ask her boss why she needs to keep all these emails? I am not aware of any compliance requirements.

                              <span>My Org has implemented a new policy requiring all new and existing Windows devices to be encrypted with BitlLocker. My experience with it is limited but I have a little bit of fear of the unknown. 
 Aside from storing the individual bitlocker keys in a secure location, is there anything I should be concerned about when implementing it or it is generally smooth sailing? Is system performance generally impacted? Some of our systems are 5+ years old. Is it possible to brick systems with bitlocker?
 Also, are there automated ways to enable BitLocker that you would recommend?

                              <span>Anyone ever run into the challenge of wanting to set up a device for ldap auth and the product has a character limit for the bind DN?
 This conflicts with our well organized AD structure which has such accounts in a particular OU, ending up having to move it to a non-standard spot, which causes severe gear grinding.
 We are running into this with our Tripplite PDUs. First time I&#x27;ve ever run into something so boneheaded.
 Am I overlooking some obvious workaround for this or do I just have to swallow my OCD on this one and live with the account in an odd spot - which for us would be the very tippy-top of our domain.
 thx!

                              <span>Is there a way in GPO to set how much space system restore points can use on the C drive? I ask because we are running AVD and noticed a bunch of C drives with low space. 
 I noticed all the space is being used in System Volume Information. When I went and set the slider to only use 50% of the drive for points it released the space back.
 I can actually stop using restore points all together if thats an option also. These machines are dispensable if that makes sense.

 I have 5 printers, 150 users (not all of them print, probably 20 active users).
 I&#x27;m looking for a cloud printing solution. So far I&#x27;ve looked into Printix, ezeep, PaperCut Hive - those solutions would cost me 3500$ or more per year - way too much for me.
 Can you recommend cheaper alternatives? I want to be able to deploy them easily, have some sort of control who can print. In the past I tried PaperCut Mobility Print but I couldn&#x27;t find a way to control who can print.
 Thank you in advance

 After finishing the assistent, several rules are created. None of them specify the device that they are applied to, just the port type (wired or wireless).
 Questions:
 How can i determine, which rule is applied to which device?
 How do i apply access rules for wired or wireless connections to multiple devices?
 ​
 Any hints are appreciated.

                              <span>Looking for some advice from veteran system admins. 
 I’m young under 26 years old, and a system admin.
 I eventually want to get into cloud security (I know broad but not sure exactly what yet). My current role covers a lot from level 1 tickets to more difficult projects/troubleshooting systems, and pay is not the best (low balled myself because I wanted the job) but love that I got this position so early in life.
 So wanted to know was it worth it for yourself to make work and getting certifications your whole life this early? Staying late in the office (long commute), studying after work and weekends for certs, online classes.
 Was the position/high salary worth it later on in life to give up traveling, experiencing life at a young age?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a SCCM server running on ms server 2012R2 Datacenter, who gives a very strange error.
 When i create a file or dir it goes oke, if i am on the server and try to change this file or dir on driveletter level then i can do than with no problem. BUT when i try to change the file or dir via an UNC path then i get an invalid MS-DOS function.
 I scouted the internet for this problem but did not get any working solutions. did chkdisk, regedit and hotfix/update to latest patch level, with no solution.
 Who has an bright idea or solved a simular problem.

                              <span>The initial version of our service consisted of distributed components that were orchestrated by AWS Step Functions. The two most expensive operations in terms of cost were the orchestration workflow and when data passed between distributed components. To address this, we moved all components into a single process to keep the data transfer within the process memory, which also simplified the orchestration logic.

 Note that this is only regarding one tool and that it&#x27;s still running as a cloud service. But it&#x27;s quite an interesting read.

                              <span>So im making some GPO changes to block users from creating or adding data to their pst files.
 Made these changes on gpo editor using the administrative templates
 Policy:
 Prevent users from adding new content to existing PST files - enabled
 Prevent users from adding PSTs to outlook profiles and/or prevent user sharing exclusive PSTs - enabled and no PST can be added
 Auto archive settings - disabled
 Disable file|archive - enabled 
 The registry keys get created with the proper value of 1 ( acording to MS ) but when i go into outlook i can still create new PST and add data/mails to existing PST 
 been breaking my head for almost a week already and i cant find whats missing , again the policy gets applied &gt; creates the registry keys with proper value but then dosent work

                              <span>Hello,
 We have an old Windows XP machine for wood working.
 The XP machine is not in domain. Until now a shared folder was mapped from Windows 10 computer (smb1.0 is enabled).
 Now we can&#x27;t reach the share, always prompt for the password but the user is not locking out from AD after 3 bad password.
 I can ping the domain controller from the Windows XP machine, everything looks fine.
 I tried to restart the machines the firewall on windows 10 machine is turned off.
 You have any idea what can I test?
 Update1 : I created an XP VM and from that VM I can reach the share. So the Windows 10 machine is good.

                              <span>Our Office 365 tenant just started having issues receiving emails for companies like ZIX, RiverApp, and SignNow just to name a few. The message is hitting Exchange Online, failing to be delivered to the recipient, and sending a NDR to the sender. The Error is as follows.
 Error: ‎550 5.7.162 OmeEncryptionAgent; Permanent Failure 550-5.7.162 Exception encountered: RmException. 550-5.7.162 Exception message: ETR encryption only applies to outgoing mail. FailureCode:UnknownFailure. Recoverable:False.. 550 5.7.162 Please contact your system administrator for more information‎
 A non-delivery report (NDR) message was sent to ‎noreply@signnow.com‎. The NDR might provide more details about why the email message wasn&#x27;t delivered and how to fix the issue. 
 We have the proper licensing to use OME and haven&#x27;t had any issues until Monday. The only thing that was done was an ALIAS domain was added for Exchange Online. I am able to send Sensitive Emails just fine.
 I contacted our reseller and they stated the those companies don&#x27;t have the required license and feature enabled to send a sensitive emails and there is nothing wrong on our end.
 Anyone have any ideas?

 I can&#x27;t see any way to change that, but I might be missing something, does anyone here know either how to change the owner of the review or make the emails stop going to me, but still go to the reviewers?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some insight from those who manage platforms either via UEM or multiple MDMs. We currently have Intune in place for Windows and looking to move to Samsung Knox for Android devices (Samsung only) as Intune didn&#x27;t have enough functionality and was infuriating to manage and push updates from.
 We&#x27;re now presented with a few iOS and Mac devices that need to be added to our network and managed under MDM. I&#x27;m toying with the idea of having a third solution for Apple devices so each one is fit for purpose but have had counter arguments that it&#x27;s best to keep things under a single pane of glass for ease of management.
 What are the pro&#x27;s and cons of both in your eyes? We don&#x27;t have much onsite resource so looking to avoid technical limitations and &quot;quirks&quot; where possible, but then also not add too many solutions into the mix for this reason.

                              <span>On devices running Windows 10 22H2 it appears that the Internet Explorer feature is being removed/ uninstalled automatically without any manual intervention. This includes the iexplore.exe being removed resulting in IE Mode not working. 
 Cannot for the life of me figure out why. Even read articles from Microsoft. Maybe I’m missing the obvious. 
 Anyone else experiencing this?
 Thanks

                              <span>Microsoft announced today that Windows admins can now choose to be emailed when new known issues are added to the Windows release health section of the Microsoft 365 admin center.
 After enrolling, IT admins will receive an email every time known issues are added or updated with new information, including changes in status, new workarounds, or issue resolutions.
 As Redmond explained, it is only available for those with admin roles in organizations with eligible Windows or Microsoft 365 for Business subscriptions that provide access to Windows release health in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
 “First, log in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and locate Windows release health under the Health menu,” said Microsoft senior program manager Mabel Gomes.

                              <span>Hi all. Work for a development company - we currently have devs supply us with their personal github account, and we provide them with the appropriate level of access for their role.
 I dislike this as we have no control over the account itself, and many people do not have a display or first/last name, meaning that in a situation where we need to offboard someone quickly we will be faced with trying to decipher what their account is called, and its always some nickname or &#x27;cooldevguy-23&#x27;, so theres a chance we miss them or disable the wrong account 
 ​
 How do you handle your github? Has anyone had this situation? At a previous company I was at we just created new accounts from the beginning...

                              <span>Guys,
 we need to be able to stop a yubikey from showing up in a VDA but the devices tab is missing from the VDA. I hear theres a setting in CitrixGroupPolicyManagement_x64.msi, but the DL is locked behind a company account which we do not have, nor to I think we&#x27;d need one.
 I tried working with registry keys but no cigar. The VDA usage interacts with our yubikey SC and locks it&#x27;s PIN shortly after. Tried reinstalling citrix workspace as admin but no devices tab shows up in the VDA.
 Can someone provide CitrixGroupPolicyManagement_x64.msi?
 This is like...really annoying :D

 ​
 I&#x27;ve been messing with ADFS since company has decided to audit the ADFS login using a 3rd party software. In order for the 3rd party software to audit can capture the details of the user logging in correctly, it requires that all relying parties be added with 6 new claim rules.
 Any idea how I can achieve this?

                              <span>Hello. I am currently in the midst of making a cheaper environment for out company in azure, but using cheaper resource tiers comes with limitation. One of them being that a basic tier VPN GW can only use Certs for P2S and its SSTP.
 So therefor we are going to be using certs. the vpn gw has a self signed root cert. and all clients need a client cert signed by the root.
 we want to be able to deploy individual certs to each employee to allow for evoking access to individual users.
 Manually making client certs for each employee is not feasible. so i want to deploy a script via intune that makes this cert for each employee.
 now here comes the problems, i need to sign these certs with a remote root. but i cant for the life of me find out how. we have the root in a key vault. but every article talking about using csr is for for signing something to the kv. 
 how do i sign with a remote root cert from the client device via a powershell script.

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I help out and have started digitising a local charity, part of this is to give them Office 365. My plan was to create a Microsoft Form so internal users could create more users inputting all the details, including selecting groups from a drop down... Sadly time has not been on my side and it&#x27;s been a few months, and I&#x27;ve still not got around to testing/getting something working.
 ​
 Does anyone have a template form and automate that they wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing to help me/charity out before i put this out to the r/slavelabour sub.
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>By default SharePoint is set to retain 500 major versions of a document. PPT docs in my environment can easily be several hundred megs each and staff are hammering these docs daily creating lots of versions as they save. A single file can be taking up 200 gig of versions and I&#x27;ve got quite a few of these files which is swamping my 1TB quota. It&#x27;s a pretty small and lean business too so they can&#x27;t afford the extorsionate prices for extra SharePoint storage. Meanwhile, we&#x27;ve got groups of people collaborating on reports that they write which legitimately require lots of versions but aren&#x27;t anywhere near the same file size. How do I manage this runaway storage consumption? Is there a way to set SharePoint to keep no more than X megabytes of versions per file at which point it purges old versions?

 For those who work y NetOps daily operations, how do you handle the high number of alerts received by email?
 I personally have the rule to move them to a separate folder and just look them up in case of an issue arises. The &quot;critical alerts&quot; are not in that rule, they rarely are triggered.

 I recently had reached out to Colby via the site&#x27;s &quot;contact&quot; form and via an email I found on his YT account (last video in 2020). I waited a week and no response to my inquiry, so I just went ahead and purchased the eBook.
 Well, the automated email services that send the .ascm file out aren&#x27;t working. Neither are the discount codes for the stencils. Tried reaching out to Colby on LinkedIn - no response and hasn&#x27;t been active in over 2 months. He hasn&#x27;t been active on Facebook since 2015 and Twitter since 2018.
 Currently waiting on PayPal&#x27;s bullshit claim process to get my $50 back.

 I&#x27;m interviewing for a new job next week - managing enterprise deployments using Cisco Meraki and VeloCloud SD-WAN. All my previous networking experience has been in a Juniper and Aruba environment - but I really want this job! Since I have about a week to study, what advice would you have or resources would you recommend for getting an up to speed on Meraki and VeloCloud SD-Wan? I know I could pick the skills up quickly on the job, but I want to show some understanding and knowledge in the interview.

                              <span>Does anybody know of any well-known network equipment vendors who actually embrace 3rd party optics?
 We all know the typical vendor spiel about how &quot;3rd party optics are not supported&quot;, and some of them go so far as to disallow their use altogether (by disabling ports, etc).
 Are any actually OK with these optics? Maybe not to the point of supporting or troubleshooting them when they&#x27;re a problem, but at least making an effort to integrate?
 It seems like there is opportunity in the industry for vendors to differentiate themselves by treating optics the way many server manufacturers treat hard drives (or at least used to).

                              <span>Mostly I&#x27;m curious about the enterprise state of the industry with respect to SFP56 for Ethernet (less so for infiniband).
 I know there are &quot;25GbE&quot; cards with single SFP28 ports on them (like the Mellanox ConnectX-4&#x27;s), but I&#x27;ve not seen any &quot;50GbE&quot; cards with a single-channel SFP56 port. I&#x27;m asking about PCIe cards, but if there are N-port SFP56 cards for switches and routers, then that would be interesting to know.
 So do single-channel SFP56 cards/switch ports exist, or is SFP56 too new at this point for that to be rolled out?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Please excuse the post if this is in the wrong subreddit. I am looking to see if a proposed network design is possible.
 We currently have a network that is double-nat&#x27;d as that is what the customer is providing us. Our network is communicating via cellular to a separate building to view all required devices. We are looking to bring all devices over to one network, however, there seems to be stability issues and due to the nature of the customer, want to keep the networks separated.
 The caveat is that both networks are programmed with the same subnet, so adding a third router will not work. (I know I know)
 As a temporary solution (Again I know), I want to propose the design below to see if it is feasible. It would effectively require the addition of two new routers to a tripple nat&#x27;d design. The requirement is that router 1 be able to talk to the devices behind router 2. My though was via port forwarding.
 Feel free to downvote if I am being dumb in my thought process or let me know if this is not possible.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just wondering, first, does Cisco still offer CLCs with larger orders of new equipment?
 Specifically, I work in K12 and we buy everything via E-Rate and our equipment ships with the EDU suffix.
 I&#x27;m trying to see about getting some CLCs with an order we&#x27;re about to place for 30 or so new switches. My rep is saying since this is E-Rate and EDU purchases, CLCs would be considered a &quot;gift&quot; which would present a problem and she is very hesitant on doing this for us.
 Is this bullshit? Is there anyone in K12 that managed to get CLCs under these circumstances?
 I do know a previous employee was successfully able to get CLCs with EDU orders. I&#x27;m wondering if I should try to escalate this issue or fight it.
 I&#x27;m also not sure what the &quot;problem&quot; of a gift would be in my situation. This is my first gig in K12 so I&#x27;m not sure how this is supposed to work in these environments.

                              <span>We currently have an expensive fiber loop linking our 3 campuses (10gig links between sites, 2gb internet) and we&#x27;re exploring more affordable options. We&#x27;re hardly using the links right now, on a heavy day the internet interface gets 1-2% usage at peak and the loop even less than that. we&#x27;re an msp that services about 2-2500 people. 
 obviously visiting msp/isp sites will tell you they&#x27;re the best. i assume leasing fiber somewhere else will be just as expensive. before we went this route we used switched ethernet. it was a 1gb link all around and it was adequate and no fiber leasing involved. beyond that i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s a good (us) solution. Anyone gone through a similar scenario lately and have some advice to share?

                              <span>Basically the best practice in our &quot;world&quot; has been devote 3 AZ&#x27;s where A and B are HA and stood up with a hot ready C in case A or B get devastated. 
 The problem now is I&#x27;m incorporating GWLB&#x27;s and TGW into our set up and I haven&#x27;t fully tested if a &quot;hot standby&quot; endpoint would work in C for the GWLB.
 I&#x27;m at the moment, kinda opposed to having a C because I haven&#x27;t heard of an entire AZ outage, but obviously need the data to support and trump my &quot;anecdotal&quot; experience.
 Anyone have some solid data?

                              <span>Hello,
 I would like to know the best solution to monitor configuration changes on Cisco equipment. We have a networking team with multiple network admins and all of them make changes to the network throughout the day. I would like to find a monitoring tool that isn’t too resource intensive to know what changes are being made to our equipment. Any suggestions on what tools would help? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m designing the network for a new production plant. I have a doubt how protect the servers network. Would be enough to segredate the servers in a dedicated VLAN routed on the core switch and configure in each server Windows firewall instead of route all the traffic in/out in the hardware firewall used also as perimter firewall?
 Could have sense put the firewall hardware on the top of the windows firewall?
 Should I monitoring with snort the traffic throught the server network?
 The company have normal network usage, internet, file share and applications based on SQL server. The invironment is fully virtualized on VmWare Esx.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi all. This is probably bordering on a rule 6 violation for you guys but I really have researched the hell out of this one and I&#x27;m getting conflicting info.
 I&#x27;ve been leased ipv4 subnets with a LOA. I want to lease these subnets to another party. I want to prevent the other party from discovering the source of my lease and cutting me out (yes, I am I middleman). The other party knows how to do an ARIN whois. Is this possible?
 If I announce these subnets on my provider&#x27;s ASN would that be enough?

                              <span>Here is the scenario we are facing, we have around 6 esxi host each hosts is having four physical ports, in which port 0 and 2 are connected to leaf sw1 and ports 1 and 3 are connected to leaf SW2. The leaf switches are in vpc but ports connecting to esxi hosts are orphan ports(compute team says something like lacp cannot be configured as per accepted design with customer). We are doing some kind of validation testing for new DC being build, the issue is when we shut down leaf SW1 the esxi hosts are reachable but when the leaf SW1 comes back again, the esxi hosts goes unreachable for about 90-120 secs. Then hosts becomes reachable. Not sure why. Does anyone aware of this issue and know why this is happening?

                              <span>When configuring a VPN gateway what is the functional difference between a split tunnel vs only including specific routes? Is it as simple as with a split tunnel DNS makes the decisions about routing? I&#x27;m trying to understand the limitations of PaloAlto&#x27;s include GP licences which does not allow split tunnel but you can limit which routes the client direct toward the VPN. I am willing to admit that I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of these concepts if so please feel free to point that out and nudge me in the right direction.

                              <span>Hey there, 
 I&#x27;ve got a few networks which I&#x27;m planning to mirror to a different location.
 I got about 6 Hubs which are currently connected to one Spoke. 
 Each Hub does have 2 active links which are connected to Spoke via Layer2. On top ECMP and OSPF
 Now I rented a bit of space in a nearby DC. 
 ​
 DR is a Fortigate and all Hubs are connected also on a clustered Fortigate.
 ​
 I&#x27;d like to get a Link between HQ A and DC. I only get a single VLAN ID, so Transparent Layer2 wont be possible. So I need Layer3.
 ​
 Now I need to set an alternative Route to those now resisiding in HQ A to create some sort of Disaster Recovery Zone
 Can somebody point me in the right direction?

 Is this right?
 I don’t know how else to build historical information as to our wan performance.

                              <span>Hey, I recently got a new laptop for school and I noticed that while it does connect to the internet, I am getting weird errors. It usually is something like &quot;This website uses HSTS, We cannot connect...&quot; for many websites, not all. Some of them give me &quot;security errors&quot; I also straight up cannot connect to some websites too. I asked my admin, who simply said to use school administered laptops, which isnt an option for my film production class as chromebooks are ass for editing videos, as you might guess...
 My networking knowledge is very limited, so let me know what it could be or what steps I could take to more closely diagnose the issue, because right now im unsure what the problem is to research.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working in Cisco TAC for some time now, and also have been lurking here for around a similar time frame. Honestly, even though I work many late nights trying to solve things on my own, I love my job. I am constantly learning and trying to put my best into every case. When I don&#x27;t know something, I ask my colleagues, read the RFC or just throw it in the lab myself and test it. I screw up sometimes and drop the ball, but so does anybody else on a bad day.
 I just want to genuinely understand why some people in this sub dislike or outright hate Cisco/Cisco TAC. Maybe it&#x27;s just me being young, but I want to make a difference and better myself and my team. Even in my own tech, there are things I don&#x27;t like that I and others are trying to improve. How can a Cisco TAC engineer (or any TAC engineer for that matter) make a difference for you guys and give you a better experience?

 I’ve been checking out the new outlook edge dev, outlook , teams and teamviewer and I have to say…what in the fuck? The new outlook appears to be the web client of outlook and other sorts of general fuckery. Not enjoying it at all, teams not so bad but they have stripped out some settings it seems.
 Am I the old guy over the fence? Surely I can’t be

                              <span>The other engineer quit at my company, we are still on the upswing of a major Dr incident. Me and my boss had an abrasive conversation today about hours expectation with only me left on the systems side until the other guy is replaced and he said we should regroup tomorrow and discuss further. I was professional, he acted taken aback sand said the expectation was always that we are working 50-55 hours on average (I asked specifically in my interview and was told 40-45) he also said that he has never had an engineer push bsck before. . I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m at any risk of being fired, and if i pushed back really hard they&#x27;d pretty much have to go with it within reason at this point. 
 I&#x27;ve seen some people reference court cases where engineers/admins have gone back and got paid out for overtime because they aren&#x27;t in a &quot;creative&quot; or &quot;manager&quot; role. I&#x27;m not looking to necessarily sue my employer at this point, just go hourly. I&#x27;m sick of working extra for free and want to be able to back my case for going hourly at least for now.
 Side note, I&#x27;m actively looking for other jobs and don&#x27;t intent to be hear another year let alone 3 months.

                              <span>Fairly new environment was setup, mostly Ubuntu machines and was hoping to have a single pane of glass to monitor 6-10 machines and it show that updates are available, HDD space, the usual kind of monitoring dashboard. Something simple to even give to a Lead/Manager or helpdesk person to keep an eye on from time to time... any suggestions? I&#x27;ve tried cockpit.. but that is one machine at a time. Looking at CheckMK, not sure it has a great dashboard for something like that.... other ideas that are open source/free?

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin - I&#x27;m trying to propose a new strategy for our laptop lifecycle in a 99% Mac shop. I know the common/standard advice is 3-4 years, but I&#x27;ve also seen articles/experiments that suggest even 2 years is a significant upgrade to productivity. However, I don&#x27;t know if that makes a lot of sense with a Mac shop - they tend to age fairly well, and unless a major hardware update comes along (like the switch from Intel to ARM processors) I&#x27;m having a hard time justifying the cost of replacing a fully functional 2020-2021 M1 laptop.
 What are your thoughts on this? Are there reports on productivity metrics for a certain cadence of Mac replacements specifically? The only ones I&#x27;ve seen seem to be centered on Windows.

                              <span>Hey, I need some help. 
 At my company, the Legal team asked us to NOT format computers, so we can´t re-assign computers from people that left the company. We dont know how long it will be this way, so I was looking for a solution. 
 Do you know of any tool that could save an image of the computer (both windows and mac) in a way that would still be valid for an external auditor / court? 
 Have you dealt with something like this before? 
 Any input is welcome!

 Don&#x27;t laugh, but my current workflow is to use Snipping Tool, then open the image in MS Paint, then mark it up. There&#x27;s got to be an easier way to do this, as it&#x27;s tedious and MS Paint&#x27;s markup sucks.
 What FOSS does this group like to quickly take screenshots, crop, outline, draw arrows, provide steps, and edit images in other ways?

 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Rebooting the server
 Requesting a new certificate and applying this to all the Policies in NPS (the existing certificate was externally trusted and still valid, but it was suggested I should try a new one anyway)
 Checking TLS settings are still set correctly (TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2)
 Performed a packet capture between one of our APs and the NPS server

 ​
 Hoping you can help. I have a laptop that i need to be able to access an access database. The access database is in our office and the laptop will be going home with a director. This is the first time WFH has come up as its a fabrication plant. 
 What&#x27;s the easiest/most reliable way to do this do you think? We can spend some money if needs be but it&#x27;s an infrequent ask so I dont want a huge spend profile. 
 The access DB is on a NAS so I could enable remote access but the users IT skills are low so I don&#x27;t want a complex solution. They could probably get a RDP session but that feels clunky especially on a 14&quot; laptop 
 ​
 TIA

Currnetlly out CA polocy only allows access from USA. However somtimes we will open up a whole country for example Mexico for one person to have access. Is there anyway to limit it to just the user? So were not allowing anything from mexico to login just the end user.

 But I am wondering why I have received windows security updates for my 2008 servers on march and april 2023. Do you guys know what&#x27;s happening? Will I receive them on the month of may too?

                              <span>This is something that may have been covered already if so, I apologize.
 My company has roughly 400 employees and 3 IT staff and I&#x27;m the only one who works on any of the O365 management, and I&#x27;m looking for some advice here. We recently went with KnowBe4 for security training, and we are utilizing the phish alert button. Currently it&#x27;s setup to send an email to our team with an attachment of the email (I think this is the default) but with how many employees we have vs how many people are monitoring and managing it the folder I have them going to is filling up rather fast.
 Does anyone else using this service have any tips or tricks to possibly automating this to grab the header information of the emails using PowerShell or even power automate? This is my first admin job so I am kind of a beginner to power automate and the exchange module in PowerShell. I currently have 250+ emails that are reported as phishing and it seems counter productive to open each one then go into the properties and scroll through the header info to find the domain or IP and block it in exchange. I also know I would need to proof some of them as some people report emails that their bosses send to them lol. 
 I do know in KnowBe4 there is an option if using the add-in via exchange to add header info to the email when reported but that isn&#x27;t working for me for some reason, I also would prefer to learn more on the automation side if possible.
 I know they also have a package you can purchase that would help with this via KnowBe4 but just getting KnowBe4&#x27;s service for a security audit was a nightmare due to an &quot;IT Budget&quot; not existing. 
 ​
 TLDR: Looking for recommendations or pointers in the right direction to automate the KnowBe4 Phish Alert Button to grab the header information from emails that are reported by users and sent to me to help efficiently block them in exchange.

                              <span>How do you add a TXT record of the same name for a description of what the CNAME record is for? The actual goal will be for CNAME DKIM records if that matters.
 For example: 
  
CNAME testdata.domain.tld ...
 TXT testdata.domain.tld &quot;This is used for XYZ&quot;
 When I go to enter the TXT record, our DNS host states &quot;testdata.domain.tld has CNAME and Non-CNAME types&quot; and doesn&#x27;t add the TXT record
  
Wondering what others do for TXT descriptors to keep track of what a DNS entry is for (if the entry doesn&#x27;t make visual sense)

 My work acquired a new company and goal is to delete/re-create Outlook profile. When users opens Outlook, they can enter their new company email address. 
 I plan on creating a GPO once this batch file works. 
 I tried the following and works once but not second or third time. Should this work?
 Thank you in advance
 taskkill /IM outlook.exe /f taskkill /IM OneDrive.exe /f reg.exe delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles /f reg.exe add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles\NewMail

                              <span>Hey guys 
 What is the best practise for a fileserver in a failover cluster with the data disk (the disks where all the user data is on with the cifs shares)?
 -ClusterSharedVolume? 
 -iSCSI mapped into the fileserver vm?
 Another possibility could be a vhdx in the SAN cluster shared volume, but I would like to use the deduplication feature from the SAN. 
 Thank you for your ideas.

                              <span>I was curious about people&#x27;s experiences with the Safe Attachment feature within Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It appears randomly people will report the attachment either takes extremely long or doesn&#x27;t end up finishing scanning. Now since my few years in IT, I feel like I would always hear this was a thing for Microsoft and this service. To me, it sounds like something out of my control (or anyone of us in this position). I speculate this can result from how the service is running and how many attachments are being filtered by Microsoft at that time. The only possible actions I can either attempt to change my safe attachment setting to send an email upon full scan (which doesn&#x27;t appear to be a thing anymore from what I&#x27;ve seen) or forward the original email yourself to have the email rescanned. I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has tips &amp; tricks on a scenario like this or if my suspicions are right.

                              <span>I was patching Apex One Server from 11564 to 12024 and it got stuck at &quot;Apply iAC server hotfix&quot;.
 Upon checking &quot;C:\TMPatch.log&quot; found that the installer runs a BAT file:

 Does C:\Program Files (x86)\Trend Micro\OfficeScan\PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\iServicePackage\iAC specify a file name

                              <span>Currently not using Apple Business Manager but I do have iOS devices in an MDM. Going to move things to Intune and drop the current MDM. One thing that the old MDM couldn&#x27;t do was automatically upgrade iOS devices. For the current MDM to do that it needed devices to be in the ABM. The current MDM can also control a lot of settings (CIS policy recommendations) but some settings required the devices to be in the ABM so those can&#x27;t be set by it. So to me, it looks like Apple only lets an MDM solution have access to whatever it decides to allow it to manage. Of course that could just be the MDM I&#x27;m using. Now with the move to Intune I&#x27;m being told by the consultant that it can push iOS updates without the ABM being used. Is this true? Also, does Intune have access to all of the iOS settings/controls without the ABM? I would like to be wrong here but I&#x27;d rather get in front of it now if the ABM is needed. Last thing I want is to find out later that I was right and using ABM is necessary to have full control over the apple devices.

In order to do so, the influencers, who are just showcasing themselves as millionaires are getting into the market by imposing the bad influence about the 9-5 jobs. 
 To be frank, 9-5 jobs or whatever jobs that you are in currently is the right fit for you. You can invest in better assets later and gradually you can increase your income and grow based on the goals. If you are misguided by the concept of getting richer as the car that phases with the jet engine, then you are in a huge misconception. 
 Pursue your education, follow your goals and let your life see the light in its own way. Cheers!

                              <span>A while back, I wrote a DMARC parser in python, with a simple tkinter GUI to help visualize the data better.
 Typically, I allow a week&#x27;s worth of reports to accumulate before throwing them all in the parser and doing a brief analysis.
 This morning, while completing this process, I noticed 3 different reports from different senders were completely empty, except for the word &quot;unused&quot;. Other than that, they appeared to look like regular reports. (Gzipped XML files)
 I couldn&#x27;t find anything related to this when I skimmed the RFC. Does this happen with anyone else or should it be expected? This is the first time it happened after around a year&#x27;s worth of use. (it broke the parser since it didn&#x27;t look like valid XML)

                              <span>I have a host with 2 sockets, 10 Cores per socket, and 40 logical cores.
 This host is mainly dedicated for 1 VM (Eclipse) but also has ZVM (Zerto) and vCLS running on it. I have 16 vCPUs / 8 cores per socket running on the Eclipse VM. Another 2 vCPUs / 1 core per socket are dedicated for ZVM and 1 vCPU / 1 core per socket for vCLS.
 We are having performance issues with our Eclipse VM (playing the finger pointing game with their support) and allocating more vCPUs to it has slightly resolved the issue. Am I able to allocate all 20 vCPUs / 10 cores per socket for that VM even though we have the 2 other VMs using up some of those vCPUs?

Obviously some of our employees change Google&#x27;s IP address  country association from time to time to their country (we don&#x27;t know who exactly), resulting in wrong currency and language in some search results for the majority of users.
 Does anybody know a way to set the GeoIP location permanently, without non-authorized persons to change it?
 I found only a form to change the IP location that can be used by anybody. The only support contact mail I could find was local to our region and seems to be operated by chatbots :-(

 Your answer could apply to any of these questions: - “What are you working on?” - “What do you do in your job?” - “Why are you trying to escape this mind-numbing chat so quickly?” - “Why do you need to leave early from the meeting-that-should-have-been-an-email?”
 The only one I could think of was from Sim City: “Reticulating splines”.

                              <span>The latest gross web push from Microsoft sees businesses forced to use Edge for certain links.
 Microsoft Edge is a good browser but for some reason Microsoft keeps trying to shove it down everyone’s throat and make it more difficult to use rivals like Chrome or Firefox. Microsoft has now started notifying IT admins that it will force Outlook and Teams to ignore the default web browser on Windows and open links in Microsoft Edge instead.
 Reddit users have posted messages from the Microsoft 365 admin center that reveal how Microsoft is going to roll out this change. “Web links from Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts and Microsoft (MSA) accounts in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge in a single view showing the opened link side-by-side with the email it came from,” reads a message to IT admins from Microsoft.

                              <span>Hey, I hope it’s okay here to ask a question…I have to make a short presentation about MS Defender Vulnerability Management for my manager and I am quite new in this Field. I read nearly the whole documentation, but I think I am a bit lost atm.
 The main questions are:
 Q: What are the different states of vulnerabilities (open, closed,...) - I can&#x27;t exactly find open, closed and other statuses. Should it be about critical, high based on CVSS or how would you understand the Task ?
 Q: How does MSD mark vulnerabilities as closed? -
 Q:Integration with ServiceNow VR Application and how is a vulnerability item updated ?
 I would really appreciate if someone could give me a short explanation to each answer, so I don&#x27;t get lost since the topic is quite big for a newbie.
 Thanks in advance and have a great day!

                              <span>As we have more and more people working outside of the office we want to start looking towards AAD and Intune for our devices.
 ​
 We&#x27;d like to start by going Hybrid AAD but one thing I&#x27;m hoping it can offer I&#x27;ve not actually seen spelt out so thought I&#x27;d ask here.
 ​
 If you have a device Hybrid AAD Joined can you log into it using your AAD credentials (username@upn) and it will authenticate against AAD or do Hybrid devices still need line of site of a DC? 
 ​
 I ask because the type of ticket that comes up again and again is when a user resets their password and their AAD \ OnPrem password is updated they are still using cached credentials on their device which causes confusion.

 I&#x27;m hoping Hybrid AAD would be a way to alleviate this issue but I&#x27;m coming up with squat while researching. Maybe my google-fu is failing me at today :)

                              <span>It&#x27;s been some month we have some random database crashes because of a Linux VPS that sometimes miss RAM and the oom_killer kills the DB because it&#x27;s the most consuming process.
 But to get more informations on what&#x27;s going on I am looking for a reliable way to monitor either the apache multiple virtual hosts I have (monitor them individually) and each DB individually on MariaDB.
 I&#x27;ve been trying Google Analytics, but it don&#x27;t show all requests on a site or the failing requests etc etc... So I was thinking about using Grafana, there is some module I can use with Apache mod_status extended. But this sounds like not really &quot;professional&quot;, it uses a github module to export status on prometheus, and then I have to re-code some part to get the extended status which interests me... Also I saw I can monitor databases with Grafana, so it sounds fine to me. Maybe some of you have good or even better solutions?
 Thanks

 The problem is that the Switch is still running on default Configuration, thus having an IP of 192.168.0.254/24 if I remember correctly. We have a connection to the network there, but it is in the network 10.100.20.xx/24.
 The way we did it before was going there, connecting directly, changing our IP to the Switches Default-Network and connecting that way.

                              <span>Has anyone gotten smart card authentication working using pam_pkcs, pcsc-lite and coolkey for a virtual machine in subject hosted in VMware workstation player/pro? I&#x27;ve got it partially working to recognize the card, prompt for pin, check user principal name in the card certs to match against AD account, then finally login. But issue comes when machine goes to lock enabled screensaver after some idle time, the user tries to unlock but it never prompts for PIN though it might say please insert your card. If you manually lock and unlock within a few minutes, it seems to load the smart card module and prompt for PIN then login in. If it&#x27;s been idle for a longer time, it fails to recognize the smart card and user has to reboot machine for it to be recognized again. Reading online the solutions I&#x27;ve come across are using VMware horizon client but I don&#x27;t have licensing or setup for that. The issue is also supposedly fixed in RHEL 8 with a newer version of pcsc-lite. I have also turned on gdm debugging and have seen a few errors regarding account expiration policy not found and the pam_pkcs module failing to load. Not sure why if during initial login it works 100% of the time. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s unreliable USB redirection with the VMware player and card reader so I&#x27;m gonna try installing the image directly on a machine to circumvent using VMware player/workstation software.

 One of our guys just renamed a user who just left so access was the same etc, I wondered what everyone&#x27;s take on this is? 
 Do you just rename if the position is like for like or do you create a new user from scratch?

 ​
 Patching is great for security perspective yet &quot;just patch the systems&quot; is a naive take. In order to keep systems available and secure at the same time, a thorough and working patch management technology (along with people and processes but out of scope of the question here) needs to be manageable, too.
 RHEL has Satellite, Windows has WSUS and so many 3rd parties exist for the ecosystem. If the environment is not fully RHEL, Satellite is not enough. WSUS does not patch 3rd party applications, so we need another solution for that. Also, you need two solutions if you pick the default ones, so a 3rd party looks like better but comes with cost. So many trade-offs.
 Aside from all the marketing online and tools in Google search result first 5 pages, what do you do to solve this puzzle? I mean your experience, by the way, not the names of possible tools only.

                              <span>So I own a small computer repair business and have set up a small lab of six computers along with the computer I would use to teach with so that would make seven. I want to be able to teach people how to install specific software and then roll back the changes perhaps on reset. I know there is software to do this but so far I&#x27;ve tried some of the demos and I&#x27;m not happy with the results. I&#x27;m not super familiar with Windows server as most of my server experience has to do with Linux, is this something I can do with perhaps active directory or other Windows server features I&#x27;m not aware of. I have no problem learning the software and can put as much time into it as needed. I have a VM for Windows server 2022 already running blue iris and some other window specific services. I&#x27;m currently using proxmox on my server at work, but at the moment besides providing some system backups to the NAS the computer lab is currently independent of the server.

                              <span>It appears that ghostscript have decided to disable the silent install option as of GS 10.01.0. Their apparent reasoning is that gs has been bundled with 3rd party software, not kept up to date, and they get grief. Then they say that it&#x27;s trivial to rebuild from source with the silent option enabled. Great, so the 3rd party software providers that compile their own software can easily rebuild the installer and keep bundling gs, but I, with no software compilation skills, can&#x27;t keep it up to date on managed end user&#x27;s PC&#x27;s....
 Sorry rant over.

                              <span>Microsoft recommends decommisioning old DCs and replacing with new, rather than in-place upgrades. This is very quick and simple, but my question is around best practice if your old DC is also your DNS server. DHCP clients are not a problem, but statically configured devices will still reference the old DC IP address as the DNS server. 
 For larger enterprises, I think implementing separate DNS resolvers is likely the best solution, but in the smaller business case I&#x27;m dealing with, continuing to use the DC as the DNS server may be the better solution, so how do I deal with this? E.g.:
  
Should I replace DC with new one at new IP and then manually go and update all statically configured devices decommissioning old DC: possibly very time consuming and easy to miss items
 Set up new DC, demote and decommission old DC and then change new DC&#x27;s IP address to match the old decommissioned DC&#x27;s IP address?
 Something else?

                              <span>After struggling with Comcast and Verizon, I’ve been quoted a decent rate by Crown Castle for 10gig fiber to my Condo building. We would simply charge everyone $100 a month for Internet.
 However, I’m wondering if this is enough for 40 units. Without any shaping or prioritization in place, what happens if a unit decides to download torrents all evening? What if 2-3 people do? 
 Will most network equipment attempt to balance by default or will data simply be dropped and slow to a crawl?

                              <span>Hey Folks,
 Hope you all are doing well. Looking for some help, suggestions, and insights.
 We are in the process of engaging multiple vendors to procure and implement firewalls for our new large medical facility. 
 For internal/data center and perimeter firewalls, specifically, two questions: do we need to use multi-vendors for these firewalls, and if so, which vendor should be used for the perimeter network - Fortinet or Palo Alto?
 We have asked all the vendors about multi-vendor approach for the data center and perimeter, but nobody could give any convincing answer.
 Also, we are considering using Sophos XGS as a Data Center Firewall. Do you have any experience with this product? Is it a good choice for implementing a Data Center Firewall?
 Thank you in advance for your responses.

 Apparently the Pacstar 447 is a ESR6300

                              <span>We have a SolarWinds server that is on our internal network. We have it pretty locked down so the only internet access it has is a whitelist of SolarWinds domains so it can update. During some downtime, I decided to look at the Okta setup procedure. I fully expected I would have to open up our firewall policies a bit to get it to work.
 To my surprise it worked with the default configuration. I double checked the FW logs and see no traffic being routed to the internet that isn&#x27;t being allowed by our one URL whitelist rule.
 I am admittedly not experienced with SAML, would this be expected or am I overlooking something with our firewall configuration allowing traffic that we shouldn&#x27;t be? Is it because the user device is forwarding the SAML response?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m a SWE at one of the major companies in the networking industry (working on Layer 3 stuff mostly). I jumped in shortly after graduating and have been working here for ~9 months now.
 I wanted to get some insight from those who started in a similar role or are just in the industry:
  
Where are you now? (Industry, role, company)
 Did you stay in the networking space or pivot to a different industry, and why?
 What advice would you give someone just starting out in the space on what career path to take for best employment prospects and earnings?
 Did you regret starting your career in/staying in networking?
 What is the compensation and attainability of upper-level roles in this industry like compared to others?
 Any specific domain of networking that you recommend specializing in? 
  
I personally enjoy various aspects of my job and learning about the intricacies of networking. However, my worry is that the knowledge I&#x27;m learning is fairly niche and there aren&#x27;t that many companies hiring folks in this industry compared to something like a Backend Developer which virtually every company needs. So I&#x27;m contemplating whether I should pivot to other roles since I&#x27;m still early in my career and won&#x27;t get boxed-in to a specific sector, and was hoping hear some opinions on the above questions to help guide me!

The project needs C9300s stacked in 3s and 4s in various IDFs. We have the 9300s but not the stack kits.
 We cannot wait for stack kits, the lead times exceed the project timeline. The question becomes: &quot;Are the 9300s worth stacking after they&#x27;re already in production?&quot; My OCD screams yes, and it would eliminate some daisychaining in a couple IDFs. However, it would require careful planning and at least one maintenance window per IDF to stack them together. I&#x27;m not sure if the juice is worth the squeeze.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>I ran nmap today on the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet (which we aren’t using.)
 It found four devices. Interestingly, when ran arp -a on my windows laptop, the device at .2 was showing a MAC address of a Unifi device, which is also what nmap said. nmap advised port 22 was open on .2 but there were no ports open for a web server. 
 When I navigated to the IP address I was presented with the login screen of a Zyxel WAP, which I successfully logged into. 
 My working theory is that there are two devices running the same IP and that the laptop has cached the MAC for the Unifi, and as it isn’t running a web server when I navigate to its IP in chrome I am getting the page for the Zyxel. Does that sound correct / plausible?
 If so, I will change the static IP set on the Zyxel and go from there.

                              <span>I have an internal Asset Management/Ticketing software and portal that I&#x27;d like to make available externally. I&#x27;ve only ever done this with locally hosted exchange servers. The actual process of configuring the NAT I get, but I&#x27;m concerned about the security implications. The portal itself is password protected against AD creds and uses a single port on the host VM server. I don&#x27;t plan on adding it to our public DNS instead having managed machines access it via link posted on their desktops. Any ACLs I would need to put in place to block other traffic?
 Since locally hosted Exchange servers basically do the same thing, except with published DNS, so I can&#x27;t imagine there would be too much to consider, but I&#x27;d certainly rather be safe than sorry.

                              <span>I thought about putting this in the fortinet sub but it’s more around network routing…
 We have a couple of sites, each with multiple pairs of Fortigate firewalls with various vDOMs configured. Each vDOM has one or more vlan interfaces which carry client LAN, DMZ, DB networks etc, and there’s a WAN interface too. These are all connected to a common edge stack with the necessary vlan IDs allowed on the switchports.
 If we wanted a VM on vlan 101 which is served by FGT pair 1, to access a VM on vlan 201 which is served by pair 2, currently we would set up a vlan interface for vlan 101 on FGT pair 2 with say 10.10.101.253 as the IP, and a static route on pair1 for 10.10.201.0/24 via 10.10.101.253.
 This is starting to get a bit unmanageable and I want to look at setting up dynamic routing acr…</span>

                              <span>Hello. It is my understanding, from the manufacturer data sheets, that the Adtran NetVanta 1550 series switches, and specifically the 1550-24 model, will support 10Gbps fiber SFP modules. Although this is a older series of switches, we have a large number of them. I was wondering if anyone is actually running that 10Gbps configuration, and if you have had good success, problems or other advice as we consider how to go from our existing 1Gbps backbone to 10Gbps. Thank you.

 Figuring out the number of uplinks from ToR &gt; Spine &gt; fabric Spine is making me kinda crazy. Anyone know of some formula that exists for figuring this out? It’s all going to be 400G uplinks with servers attached at 100G

                              <span>I apologize in advance for my novice level of knowledge in Networking.
 I&#x27;m building a small server rack and in looking for RJ45 couplers I&#x27;ve seen some listed as CAT5e, CAT6, CAT7 etc,. I was under the impression that CATx was in reference to a standard for the cables themselves rather than the connector. I suspect it has to do with the shielding but I wanted to check with the pros.
 I have attempted to search for the answer online without success.
 Example: If I&#x27;m using CAT8, connecting to a rack coupler that&#x27;s labeled as CAT5e will there be a significant drop in performance? Or does the coupler itself not impact the performance as long as the cables themselves (on both ends of the coupler) are up to the CAT8 standards?

 We are looking to have a https wildcard certificate secured guest portal with employee sponsorship with CoA vlan change so they don’t have to switch SSIDs once approved.
 We are also looking for a similar portal for BYOD where employees log in with their azure AD creds and get a CoA to a BYOD vlan once authenticated.
 We have tried XMC-SE/NAC, A3 and now Cisco ISE. We keep having issues with redirecting and difference in action based on the client depending on if using HTTPS, HTTP or FQDN. We’ve also had issues with CoA not working with ISE. We’ve purchased consulting hours through extreme and Cisco and aren’t having much luck.
 Curious if anyone has gotten this working and what products and methods you use?

                              <span>Hello, all. I have a legacy OTV environment that I am troubleshooting as there are connectivity issues, While reviewing the configuration I noticed a pattern in the OTV overlay instances. Here is an example:
 service instance 998 ethernet
 encapsulation dot1q 998
 mac access-group filter_fhrp out
 bridge-domain 998
 Looking at the documentation, I see this being configured as an in-bound filter, not as the out-bound filter like in the config &quot; mac access-group filter_fhrp out&quot;. Why might this be configured as an outbound filter?
 Here is a simple topology example. The OTV configuration exists on A-CR01 &amp; B-CR01. An example of an issue is reachability to the internet from hosts connected to B-CS01. A-CS01 is the only device with internet access.

What makes group 17 different than group 90 (aside from the obvious &quot;they&#x27;re different numbers&quot;)? I assume there&#x27;s a cheat sheet somewhere, but I haven&#x27;t found it online. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

                              <span>This seems like it should have a simple answer, but I&#x27;ve done that many Google searches that Google stopped me to make sure I was human, and there wasn&#x27;t a simple answer amongst all the searches I tried.
 If I have a NPS/Packetfence/Clearpass/FreeRadius running in a VM(HyperV) and I have a single 802.1x capable switch and I want port auth on every port on the switch including the one that NPS is running from, how do I deal with the NPS authorising itself?
 This sounds right but seems wrong: is it as simple as having a management VLAN that the switch can talk to NPS on and that VLAN in HyperV NIC for that VM is either tagged/untagged so that the switch can communicate without needing to authorise itself? 
 That still seems flawed if someone knew the VLAN ID albeit minimal access would be possible in it(1812,1813 exposed at most I would have thought)

                              <span>One of the top posts on /r/networking is this one about Fiber Optics
 But it’s very outdated now. Now we have MTO/MTP, Channelization (break-out) 100Gbps to 25Gbps, 40Gbps to 10Gbps, etc. The ins and outs of MTO/MTP.. type A vs type B polarity, male vs female, patch panel break out panel… it’s all extremely complex and difficult to get straight.
 This would be an extremely valuable post!

 It seems that things are improving across the board so wanted to check what hardware delivery lead times people are getting. 
 I’m particularly interested in Cisco, Juniper and Arista.

 Anyone know a really working VPN in China?
 Some of my european colleagues must go for business trip in China and must communicate with our office and ERP.
 I need the best reliable VPN cause our IT Dpt cannot contact the colleagues if VPN doesn&#x27;t work.
 I have read about Astrill that it&#x27;s good and working in China.
 Some advise?
 There is something better and reliable?
 There is also private corporate IpSec tunnel allowed from China to out?
 Thanks

 I have a bit of time at work right now, as I am waiting on our service providers. 
 Since I&#x27;m the only one in IT and I have no documentation from my predecessor, I&#x27;d like to get more involved with our Firewalls.
 Couldn&#x27;t really find good ressources, do you have any tips? I thought about setting up a Firewall (pfsense) try around there, but I&#x27;d like to understand the fundamentals more (drop, deny, accepts, setting rules etc).
 Thank you for any guidance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am currently experiencing a weird networking issue at work. Link at the bottom for abstracted architecture.
 We have two ISPs and two firewalls in different buildings.
 The ISP Routers are connected to a switch, whose only purpose is to connect both Firewalls (Fortigate) to the ISP router in case of firewall failure.
 Outgoing traffic gets replies that are properly handled by the firewall (doesn&#x27;t seem to be a L1-L3 problem on the side of the ISP).
 Incoming traffic however does not get handled properly - Pings from WAN to the interface do not receive a reply, Port forwarding does not work either. On the other interface the configuration is the same but it works.
 When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP1s network (1.1.1.2), there is no reply.
 When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP2s network (2.2.2.1), there is a reply.
 When capturing network traffic on switch 1 (traffic on the interfaces that are connected to the firewalls, both directions) i can see that the ping request gets sent to the active firewall. There is no reply though.
 When i plug a laptop into the switch 1 and give it the IP address of the router (1.1.1.1, no further addresses available sadly) i get a reply to the ping.
 The firewalls are fortigates, they are configured as active/active but from what i&#x27;ve gathered only the primary firewall handles traffic, the secondary firewall gets used to offload security processing.

 Any ideas what i could look into further?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>We have an odd intermittent fault happening where all devices connected to our either our 2nd or 3rd switch becomes un routable. The only way to fix it is to change the wan connection to a port on the broken switch and then back again. Anyone had this before?
 Can ping all logical addresses. Have rebuilt the VSS stack multiple times using the VSS cisco guide. No interface errors No output log errors

However I noticed a good handful of them are blinking a steady amber at the exact same time and in unison. The end devices connected to those ports seem like they&#x27;re fine, but I don&#x27;t have a clue as to why they&#x27;re showing a different visual indication than the rest. Any ideas?

 Here&#x27;s my thought process:
  
A is false because the L1 LSP includes all subnets directly attached to the router itself, not the entire area.
 B is false because the L1 LSP wouldn&#x27;t include subnets advertised by R6 since it&#x27;s in another area.
 C is the correct answer, but I thought the L2 LSP included all subnets attached to routers in the area in which the L1/L2 router resides (which is why I chose D), not just itself.
  
Their own lab guide for this exam has this statement for the section where you configure a multi-area topology which seems to contradict this question: &quot;display the details of the level-2 LSP advertised by your P router. Observe that it only includes level-2 capable neighbors in its topology information and that it includes all the area subnets in its IP reachability information, not just the subnets that are directly attached to it.”

 I work for an investment fund that is small in terms of people, but we manage a reasonable amount of assets and we&#x27;re buying/selling publicly traded securities, so having our internet be rock-solid is important. We are currently using Spectrum HFC in our office and we&#x27;ve been pretty unhappy with speeds and uptime. All of our computers are on a VPN that is Arizona based, and we will often have 3 - 4 people with Bloomberg terminals open, downloading medium-sized files from our file system (i.e., via the VPN) while on Zoom calls. There are ~10 people in the office at any given time.

 Our users are experiencing voice issues from hard phones, whether the handset, headset, or speaker is being used, call quality is cutting in and out, sometimes there&#x27;s static, sometimes robotic, other times it&#x27;s &#x27;like the caller is underwater.&#x27;
 We have about 50 sites and each site has anywhere between 5-50 users, based on the size of the site. 
 I currently have about 5 of the bigger sites, ranging between 25-50 users complaining about voip problems. Phone calls cutting in and out, not being able to hear the caller. 
 Please note: We don&#x27;t manage our own Voip solution, that&#x27;s outsourced to an MSP, the MSP says it&#x27;s not them, when they request call examples and listen to the pcaps they come back clear. 
 While each site is different …</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I know very little about Metro Ethernet. So for those of you who have experience with this, I was wondering why (if both are offered by a Provider) one would ever select an E-Line service instead of an E-LAN service? From a quick glance, it would seem that E-LAN is much more scalable if you need to connect future remote offices. Is there a huge difference in the cost or something? I also don&#x27;t know why anyone would ever select E-Tree over E-LAN. Thanks in advance for any insight you can offer!

If we disable the adapter through GPO is there any website out there that absolutely 100% actually requires ipv6/teredo tunneling that this would effect? As it is we are blocking teredo traffic that is not going out to microsoft on our firewall but it would be easier if we could just turn it off altogether.

                              <span>Hey guys, I have a few questions regarding routing and firewall rules with the UDMP and unifi gateway products.
 We have a large 172.30.x.x /17 network with each site having a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro and being allocated a /21 subnet. Our AWS VPC network is 172.31.x.x/16.
 Routing between sites is handled via IPSEC vpn tunnels to a VyOS router in AWS EC2. This facilitates routing between each /21 and the 172.31.x.x networks.
 I am confused about how the firewall rules are supposed to be setup in Unifi network.
 I want to allow all traffic from 172.30.x.x/17 and 172.31.x.x/16 to go in and out of each other UDMP, as well as ping each other&#x27;s WAN interfaces. I&#x27;ve created a group on each UDMP containing these networks/subnets, to be used to apply to each rule&#x27;s &quot;address group&quot;.
 How many rules do I need to apply? and on which interfaces? (WAN OUT, WAN IN, WAN LOCAL, LAN IN, LAN OUT, LAN LOCAL). This is a simple configuration that is made difficult in my head due to all the various directoins and interfaces.
 Next question, there&#x27;s a radio button to &quot;don&#x27;t match on IPSEC traffic&quot; when creating rules. Do I want this checked or not? All of the connections between sites are IPSEC tunnels, all inter-site traffic will be traversing an IPSEC tunnel. This is made even more confusing with the 3 options:&quot;Don&#x27;t match on IPSEC traffic&quot;&quot;Match inbound IPSEC traffic&quot;&quot;Match inbound non-IPSEC traffic&quot;
 Any insight would be appreciated. I would appreciate it if only those who have direct experience working with this exact interface would respond. I understand the idea and fundamentals of how this is supposed to work, however when applying rules the outcome isn&#x27;t as you would expect. So I want to know the &quot;proper&quot; or &quot;intended&quot; way that these options are supposed to be used.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m having some trouble setting in a Fortigate IPsec VPN in Azure. We&#x27;ve had the Fortigate NVA set up with HA in Azure for years (set up by others, not me).
 ​
 I need to set up an IPsec VPN so users can remotely connect into the environment. I cannot use the Azure VPN at this moment due to it being used for other reasons and it has a very restrictive NSG on its subnet.
 I followed the article here (https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/5.6.0/cookbook/589121/ipsec-vpn-with-forticlient) yet I&#x27;m not able to connect via the client. I get this error when trying to connect:
 ​
 VPN connection failed. Please check your configuration and network connection, then retry your connection. If the problem persists, contact your network administrator for help. 
 In my VPN client config I&#x27;m using a public IP from the load balancer. There are two load balancing rules to map UDP ports 500 and 4500 to the backend (the two Fortigate VMs in HA). 
 If I run the command below I can see my client is trying to connect:
 diagnose sniffer packet any &quot; host myclientip and port (500 or 4500)&quot; 4 0 l Using Original Sniffing Mode interfaces&#x3D;[any] filters&#x3D;[ host 142.113.161.68 and port (500 or 4500)] 2023-05-02 19:14:04.734193 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:07.870742 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:07.870746 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:10.910803 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:10.910806 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:13.937669 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:13.937672 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 
 I&#x27;m at a loss of what to check next. Any guidance or assistance would be very much appreciated.

                              <span>I am trying to get the received/sent byte fields from Netflow from our Meraki MX67. I saw a similar question to this online but that&#x27;s because they were using v5 and only v9 sends output messages.
 Anyone have any luck with Logstash and getting that field?
 My current output looks like below:
  &quot;host&quot; &#x3D;&gt; { &quot;ip&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;10.210.73.1&quot; }, &quot;@version&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;1&quot;, &quot;@timestamp&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 2023-05-02T17:59:06.000Z, &quot;netflow&quot; &#x3D;&gt; { &quot;in_pkts&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 44, &quot;in_bytes&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 6832, &quot;flow_seq_num&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 121282, &quot;ipv4_dst_addr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;10.213.73.251&quot;, &quot;protocol&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 17, &quot;l4_src_port&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 4500, &quot;input_snmp&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 1, &quot;l4_dst_port&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 35780, &quot;output_snmp&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 38, &quot;last_switched&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;2023-05-02T17:54:07.600Z&quot;, &quot;flowset_id&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 5206, &quot;version&quot; &#x3D;&gt; 9, &quot;first_switched&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;2023-05-02T17:54:04.660Z&quot;, &quot;ipv4_src_addr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;208.54.32.35&quot; } } 
 This is my config file for Logstash
 input { udp { port &#x3D;&gt; 2055 codec &#x3D;&gt; netflow { versions &#x3D;&gt; [9] } } } output { # Output events that match the filters to stdout stdout { codec &#x3D;&gt; rubydebug } # Output to a local file { path &#x3D;&gt; &quot;loggingforme.txt&quot; codec &#x3D;&gt; rubydebug } }

                              <span>Our edge routers currently do not have an ACL on their internet-facing interfaces. These are our internet edge routers which run eBGP with our ISPs. I&#x27;m trying to research best practices for this ACL.
 I&#x27;m on an ASR1K. Here is my latest draft:
 ip access-list extended INET permit icmp any any echo-reply # Only allow responses to ICMP echo initiated internally permit tcp any any established # Allow TCP traffic for sessions initiated internally permit ip  any # Allow our other DCs to freely communicate with each other permit tcp any any eq 179 # Allow BGP peering permit tcp any eq 179 any # Allow BGP peering deny any any 
 I&#x27;m concerned about adding this ACL as the ASR1K is not a stateful device. Therefore, I think it will drop return UDP packets. This is highly concerning as we use UDP-based applications extensively. Due to UDP being a connection-less protocol, there is no such thing as permit udp any any established.
 Can anyone suggest best practices for an ACL like this? Is there a document from a major vendor with examples? How do ISPs handle this scenario? I&#x27;m struggling to find relevant resources on Google.

                              <span>I hope this isn&#x27;t too low level for the sub, but I do need a sanity check here.
 I have to automate a few facilities with IoT gear. The best solution I found is based on using specific hardware from China to gather the data and control devices.
 As &quot;server&quot; I have a small Beelink machine, which should work just fine for the task. The communication is over MQTT.
 Now, the CEO is worried that there may be adversarial code on those devices and wants me to ensure everything is safe.
 Initially I thought I could just cut those devices off from the Internet at the router/firewall. 
 Lying in bed tonight at 2h30am I figured I could also just have two physical networks. One for the hardware I/O and one that communicates with our server on the web. Were not running centrifuges here. The motivation for an elaborate attack should be minimal.
 The on-site server would then need two NICs. It has one ethernet on board and maybe get another via USB or use Wifi.
 This seemed like a good idea at first, but then I remembered a story from way back when in the 90s.
 I worked for a large company that had large banks as their clients. One of my colleagues was the blessed one that had a direct network connection into one of those banks besides the one into the local network.
 However for some reason that I don&#x27;t remember his computer acted as router between those two networks. Obviously that shit got shut down real quick once the banks IT department caught wind of it.
 Is this something unavoidable or can I reliably configure this possibility away? The server runs on Debian.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have a client that is implementing a new DR site, he wants to recreate all the same subnets that he has in HQ exactly as it is in DR with the same gateway even the same Public IP for online pubished services. He has that idea in mind to do a seamless failover in case something wrong went to the VM without any manual intervention. Is this really possible. What are the side backs and the cons if any. I should mention that this client is an ISP so he controls the mpls network between the sites

 My plan is to set up an old laptop and have that streaming out the security video. Does anyone know of a website that would allow a sign in to view stream? Or a different subreddit to ask this in if my question doesn&#x27;t fit here? 
 I contemplated port forwarding the camera access ports but nothing in the documentation says if this will work or not.

 router-id: 83.23.xxx.xx irr-server: rr.ntt.net rtr-server: rtr.rpki.cloudflare.com:8282 keep-filtered: true accept-default: true source4: 83.23.xxx.xx asn: 65444 prefixes: - 196.xxx.xxx.xxx/24 kernel: export: false # Communities ## 65444:101:1 - Learned from upstream ## 65444:101:2 - Learned from customer ## 65444:101:3 - Learned from peer templates: upstream: local-pref: 90 filter-irr: false announce: [ &quot;65444:101:2&quot; ] add-on-import: [&quot;65444:101:1&quot;] peer: local-pref: 100 filter-irr: true filter-rpki: true remove-private-asns: true enforce-first-as: true enforce-peer-nexthop: true filter-prefix-length: true allow-blackhole-community: true filter-transit-asns: true auto-import-limits: true auto-as-set: true announce: [ &quot;65444:101:2&quot; ] add-on-import: [&quot;65444:101:3&quot;] peers: Upstream: asn: 65443 template: upstream multihop: true next-hop-self: true listen4: 83.23.xxx.xx neighbors: - 77.62.xxx.xxx 
 In this example my ASN is 65444 and my upstream is 65443. I plan on moving to another host and having them both live at the same time lets use 65442 as the new provider, how can I set it so that when both are live my old upstream 65443 will stop routing my IP ranges and 65442 will be the priority route. I beleive I can do this with prepend but I am not sure how the config should look on both ends.

                              <span>Hey folks, so was recently upgrading from UniFi to Aruba AP 515 for one of our client. During that in initial setup we choose country, after choosing India the APs decided to just not broadcast any SSID whatsoever spent my entire evening troubleshooting that. Turns out 510series has some country code issue. 
 So is it the device fault OR that particular model isn’t supported in my region? Very curious to know the RC.

The idea is to pass access management of folders or teams off to department leaders for Managment. I see this being a disaster from a management standpoint as a system administrator. Wondering if anyone here has every completely dropped files servers and moved over to teams. How did it go?

                              <span>Dear fellow SysAdmins,
 Despite having left my previous toxic position near my house, I encountered an unexpected setback at my new job. I had given my previous employer two weeks&#x27; notice and was due to start at a client of an MSP company on May 1st. However, the start date was postponed to May 15th due to unforeseen circumstances.
 I have received news that the new MSP company that I would have been working at, is shutting down and they will no longer be able to offer me the position. As a result, I am now without a job and must begin the job hunt anew.
 I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or advice that you all may have on what I should do in the meantime. Furthermore, I have a legal question regarding the employment agreement letter that I signed. As a resident of the NYC area, I am wondering if there are any laws that protect my rights in this situation, pay wise, or if I am out of luck.
 Thank you all for your time and assistance.

                              <span>Our Network Engineering team is rolling out new subnets for most locations, and the range of address space they’re choosing is 172.32.x/24, 172.33.x/24, etc. They’re up to 172.44.x.x now, I think, and quite a few have been rolled out.
 I think they just didn’t realize that the RFC 1918 class B network range ends at 172.31.255.255, and now we’ve got public ip ranges inside our corporate network and are seeing various kinds of issues like excess prompts to authenticate to cloud providers. I asked about the ranges used for the new subnets and got a “Cisco said it’s OK,” in response so all I’ve done is indicate that I think it merits looking into, but no one’s looked into it. 
 Have any of you heard about the range 172.32.0.0-172.44.255.255 being used internally for private addressing? I’ve seen it done before, but only out of ignorance, and correcting it is always painful. Everything I’ve read and heard from past coworkers says this is a very bad thing to do, but the people doing it now disagree, and they’re VERY confident they’re right. Which is a little terrifying.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>A quick story for you. I just found myself on the wrong side of some malicious compliance. For years, I&#x27;ve had issues with Dell support. I&#x27;m sure we all have. My particular issue stems from their refusal to contact me via email. They always call. I don&#x27;t WANT a phone call. Chances are I&#x27;m working on a different issue, on a different call, my mind&#x27;s on another task, and I don&#x27;t want to just drop everything. Especially if we&#x27;re talking about a Sev3 or so where I just need a little guidance. Email&#x27;s great, I can wrap up my current thought and then pivot to the support request.
 Since I can&#x27;t get them to stop calling, and I&#x27;m tired of simply ignoring their call and then responding to the ticket as though I didn&#x27;t notice, I wanted to force the issue. You can&#x27;t remove your phone number entirely - it wants numbers in that box. But, it turns out the box isn&#x27;t cross referencing with telco providers to ensure the phone numbers are legitimate. So a couple months I put some nonsense in there which would make it flatly impossible to call me, and promptly forgot I&#x27;d ever done so. Yeah you probably see this conclusion coming.
 Last Monday I opened an SR, and as the week dragged on, the silence started to grow more suspicious. By this morning it was clear that my SR had landed in the wrong queue, so I pull up the support site to check the status of the SR. Closed due to lack of customer contact because they were unable to reach me on the phone. I mean, of course you were unable to reach me, you can&#x27;t dial 111-111-1111, it&#x27;s simply not a thing. What the bloody hell list did I end up on where these people will not just email me? I&#x27;m leaving the number in there, I guess I&#x27;ll just CC every account exec I&#x27;ve ever crossed paths with on every SR from now on with &quot;My preferred method of contact is by email&quot; pasted between every paragraph of every ticket I submit.
 Ahh Dell, you useless, useless company.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve implemented a new help system at my place of employment after a merger and I&#x27;m trying to coach my new users on putting in tickets correctly. I originally hid the option to select a priority when submitting a ticket but now that I have people putting in emergency requests that are not emergencies, I&#x27;ve decided to unhide priority, but I already have users putting all of their tickets in as high priority, even though they aren&#x27;t. 
 Other than warning people about the boy who cried wolf (i.e., if all of your tickets are high priority, we will start treating them as if they aren&#x27;t and the one time you actually do need help quickly, you won&#x27;t get it and it&#x27;s all your fault), what&#x27;s the best way to communicate this to your users? Or have you had any luck at all with this?

                              <span>I work in a medium-sized organization running a hybrid environment. Our ticketing system is AD synced so when a user locks themselves out of their company account, they must call the help desk to unlock the account. My question is how do you verify your user&#x27;s identity when they call for account unlocks?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to find some correlating events to understand why we had some users have their user profiles nuked overnight and this morning. 
 We had probably 20-30 users now reporting that logging in this morning was like logging into a fresh computer. This doesn&#x27;t appear to be a normal corrupt profile situation, their profile was deleted and created fresh upon login. 
 Sometime overnight you can see the EventID 1 from Search-ProfileNotify saying the Windows Search Service indexed data for the user and it was successfully removed in response to user profile deletion. When they login you see a similar event that their profile is being created. What I&#x27;m trying to figure out is what in the world would have caused this request to happen. Are there no event ID&#x27;s tied to a requested profile deletion or what triggered it?
 No Windows updates were deployed this week either. Basically looking for any advice that might lead me down a breadcrumb trail to figuring out what in the world happened. And also why it only effected this small amount of users.

                              <span>The short-short version of the story is that my new PowerEdge R650 servers came with the System Profile Setting &quot;Performance-Per-Watt (DAPC)&quot; which refers to the Dell Active Power Controller. With DAPC in control of CPU frequency scaling the cpufreq driver would not load and I was stuck at the base CPU speeds. The fix is to change the System Profile to Performance and let the OS control CPU frequency scaling. This unlocks OS control of CPU turbo speeds and gave me an instant 1 GHz boost per core.
 The dev team will be pleased that the new servers are no longer 30% slower than the rest of the fleet.

                              <span>Hello Everyone!
 I was recently having a conversation with a coworker, regarding PTO in IT. In this instance, when I refer to PTO, I am also referring to sick leave, and vacation time, just not holiday pay. We were discussing how many days the average (full-time, 9-5, Mon-Fri) IT person needs in order to maintain a healthy work/life balance. I’m thinking 15 days is a good average, and my coworker is thinking something closer to 20, but we would love to get more opinions on the matter.
 As a follow up to that, what would be the minimum PTO/Sick Leave/Vacation time package you would accept from a prospective new employer?
 ​
 EDIT: Every person is different, and answering this kind of question can be tricky considering the different needs of different people, for the sake of this discussion, I am mainly referring to averages, to make it somewhat easier to answer. I also wanted to put a disclaimer here that I am not saying everyone should be able to make 15 days work for them, but just on average that is what most people probably would need to maintain a healthy work/life balance. Absolutely nothing wrong with needing more than that, or less than that in my opinion.

                              <span>Heya, 
 First a bit of a disclaimer, I do sysadmin just part time in a small firm of 15 ish employees and don&#x27;t have much of a background in it other than being the only one here able to distinguish an .exe from a .pdf... 
 Discovered some weird logins on our exchange online to one account but originating in another country. After some password resets and talking to the user it seemed fine but then the third party were in again a few hours later. By now I figured my users computer was fucked and we took it offline while locking and/or resetting all their various accounts. Problem solved.
 Today when I got my hands on the computer I found the following:
 - Email received from a domain we generally trust (so they got compromised first) with a &quot;PDF&quot;, ofc its an .exe but with file extensions being hidden.
 - Inexperienced user had launched it just an hour before the first odd logins.
 - Running it (on an empty user, offline) does open a PDF in the default browser (firefox) but the location is /appdata/roaming/winupdate_2025/out.pdf which is neither the location or name of the original file.
 Curious about how it got access to logins / passwords at this point but exhausted my very shallow knowledge. Any tips for how to dig a little deeper on this?

 It got me thinking...does the nature of the job give us ADHD like tendencies or are there a lot of us that have been running blind forever and this line of work just clicks for us?
 My background is not just in sysadmin. I&#x27;m a DBA, Salesforce Admin, ERP admin so I wear a lot of hats in a small company where I take care of a lot.
 It feels like my brain is the result of my environment instead of the other way around.

                              <span>I have received notification of auto enablement of Security Defaults on my Microsoft tenant.
 I have no problem doing so as we already use per user mfa across the board, but I have a legacy app that needs to sign into mailboxes using imap to crawl and ingest their content.
 The vendor tells me OAuth will still work with Security Defaults enabled, however everything on Microsoft website says IMAP and POP are disabled when Security defaults is enabled.
 Can anybody confirm this one way or the other, I’m going to raise with MS as well but sometimes that’s not helpful…

                              <span>So basically our company has contracted another company to provide data collection on our machines and robots (similar to production manager and mattec). (was done without my consultation but thats another story). 
 Anyways, for the data collection to work, said company has been having their clients use a small home nat router at the machines/robots to give the robots a private IP and keep them off the network. 
 I said this is dumb to put a million little points of failure at every machine/robot we own. I asked if they&#x27;re is any other way to do this. They said, all the other companies they&#x27;ve done it to have gone this way. (apparently they&#x27;re all smaller places, we are decently sized and have more than one plant so ig we are the Guinea pigs?)
 My proposition is I just get a high end CISCO 9300 and just give the ports private NAT, would that be the best way to go about this? I&#x27;ve asked vendors if this would work and they are clueless, and my peers are just as clueless about it.

                              <span>I deployed my Windows 11 Image via MDT. Customised it, installed all the updates, then sysprepped/generalized and set it to boot to Out of Box Experience. I then created the sysprep &amp; capture task sequence via MDT. When i boot to that task sequence though I get errors that when googling seem to point to the fact that I have sysprepped too early.
 Can anyone confirm this before I start the process from the beginning without actually knowing if its going to work? Or let me know what I&#x27;m doing wrong because this process definitely should be easier than I&#x27;m making it out to be.

                              <span>As part of an overall strategy I am being asked to set up a custom email domain for a business. They intend to sell accounts for various domains. 
 Example: &gt;&gt;
 User then pays some amount a year or whatever to be [person@&gt;&gt;.com](mailto:person@customdomain.com) that&#x27;s just a forwarder. (or I suppose you could pay more for an actual mailbox). 
 Not sure if this is the place to ask but am hoping to get some ideas from this group.

                              <span>Hey there! I&#x27;m pretty new to redhat. I just started in a work-project and have the (questionable) honor to get a transaction monitor (openUTM) running. 
 That transaction monitor needs semaphore(s). And for the life of mine, I can&#x27;t seem to get it. I already found out, that &quot;ipcs&quot; shows me semaphores that are already there. But there are none. I think &quot;ftok&quot; should show me a number I can use to add a semaphore - but it won&#x27;t work, ftok always gets a syntax error. 
 I&#x27;m completely new to this, &quot;usually&quot; I&#x27;m just a dev for legacy-software. Any help would be wildly appreciated!

                              <span>A user comes to me today complaining of a issue with there computer, what they described to me was essentially fixed by explaining how sharepoint caching works.
 They also described a mouse issue but it didn&#x27;t happen throughout the day. (not to mention I was 2 desk away and heard them having a complain about this issue. If I hadn&#x27;t have gone and asked the I guarantee I wouldn&#x27;t have heard about it)
 They have had this laptop for 2 months and said it&#x27;s been happening since they got it. 
 If you were in my shoes on the reply would you add a line to the effect of: In the future please be sure to let me know when issues start occurring, so that I can fix them before they intterupt you doing urgent work. 
 Or would you just let it sit? 
 And before you ask: Yes I&#x27;m responding to emails/tickets after hours, no they&#x27;ve never logged a ticket before, yes they know how to log tickets. 
 My question is more do I call them out on it or not?

                              <span>Hi all,
 One of our factories work with acidic baths. Since this is quite a corrosive environment we are looking in to a protective covers for these AP&#x27;s.
 We have found cover&#x27;s for these AP&#x27;s from Aruba itself, but we don&#x27;t think that these offer the protection necessary.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi all. After a bit of help. Working on a SR650 with Dual CPU and 14x 16GB of memory.
 Sales have sold an extra 4x 32GB to add to the system. I can&#x27;t get this working without it erroring.
 I think the issue is the location of the 32Gb dimms and the matching channels.
 I have the sr650 memory table for 18 dimms but this is no help with where to put the 32GB sticks.
 Is there a configuration helper somewhere or can someone advise?
 I&#x27;ve been using this table, at the bottom

                              <span>Out of the blue an employee, new to the business, wants to be able to attach files to PDF&#x27;s. If there&#x27;s a logical reason to do this, and the business is prepared to fund software licensing to support it (if agreed there will be a small group doing this), then I&#x27;m not aware of any reason to not support the request.
 However, is anyone here more knowledgeable on the above and is aware of any problems that may be caused / issues to be aware of? Wikipedia states that the ISO spec / standard for PDF files allows file attachments so in theory as long as any application (Adobe Acrobat, Foxit etc.) adheres to the standard there should be no problems?

 MS also announced that the first LTSC version of Windows 11 will launch in H2 of 2024.

 I spent the weekend looking at PowerAutomate, I wanted to know what are some good ideas that I could start implementing as beginner flows?
 Maybe connect it to JIRA for our MSP so when a ticket is updated, it adds it to my Microsoft Planner?

                              <span>Hey Guys, I appreciate your help. I have a “not activated” windows laptop and a business premium license. In the license it says that I have “windows 10/11 pro” but when I use “access work or school” it still says windows not activated. Does anyone know how to fix it? Appreciate your help.

                              <span>I have a 2022 Hyper-V host, installed at Xmas time, which has been working well, except this month, when trying to patch it, I have been unable to get CU April installed. 
 I have tried installing from WU, and downloaded the CU manually from MS Catalog and tried to install it. 
 I have two errors. 
 0x800F081F and 0x80248007
 ​
 I tried running the update troubleshooter, no luck. I followed the instructions for resetting WU:
 Open the administrative Command Prompt and type the following commands one by one followed by Enter key.
 ​
 net stop wuauserv
 net stop cryptSvc
 net stop bits
 net stop msiserver
 Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
 Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
 net start wuauserv
 net start cryptSvc
 net start bits
 net start msiserver
 ​
 Also no luck. Not sure what I need to do to get this update installed. 
 Unfortunately due to an oversight (resolved for future), the last CU was December for Windows, though the Feb .net 3.5 CU was installed successfully. 
 ​
 ​
 Any bright ideas?

                              <span>So I just received a report on an external audit that was done by an external audit firm on the active directory policy at our organization. My question is how does some one go about auditing active directory? Does it mean they have access to the AD and check out the policies or they run it against a software to get the audit policies configurations? I am fairly new to this and I am learning a ton as I go along.

I can&#x27;t find it any longer and searching the internet, I only find articles that explain how to buy or configure microsoft 365.
 Fun fact, I tried the new Bing Chat and it sucked.
 Dear hive mind, help me find what I&#x27;m looking for.

                              <span>So apparently a line card broke somewhere in a Spectrum router in Dallas a few weeks ago, and it broke the majority of IPv6 connectivity in the area.
 I&#x27;ve worked with multiple content providers, from Akamai, Cloudflare, Microsoft, and AWS on mailing lists trying to (mostly successfully) route around the problem, but there&#x27;s still plenty of networks still unreachable.
 How do you even deal with an issue like this? This appears to affect hundreds of thousands of people in the DFW area from our tests asking people on the NANOG mailing list (i.e. unable to ping Quad9 IPv6), but Spectrum has been unable to give us a basic ETTR, even with our multiple Enterprise agreements. They&#x27;ve only assured us it falls under our SLA (which I guess is a good thing, at this point we have a lot of free service).
 If you work for Spectrum, please look at INC000026440632 and ECT-82023751, we are suffering.

                              <span>We are looking at potentially revamping our wireless. We currently have Aruba with an on-prem mobility controller. 106 total access points. We have some weak areas. I do know we would need to increase the amount of aps to increase footprint. Also we would need to beef up for 3 auditoriums. All that being said, Aruba has worked well for us and does well except we need more of them (not a fault of aruba).
 Currently have meraki switching. I&#x27;ve used meraki wireless in the past and it works well enough. I just hate the fact of the licensing with meraki. At least with our current aruba we buy license once and there isn&#x27;t an ongoing cost. 
 All that considered, we have a vendor willing to let us demo juniper/mist, meraki, aruba, or really anything we want. This is in a community college environment. 
 Thoughts? Recommendations? Things to look for during demo?

                              <span>EDIT: Thanks for your input everyone, keep it coming. I still think it&#x27;s better to cross the trunk but I&#x27;m soaking up all your comments to make as an informed decision as possible.
 We’re working on a new building and at the stage of terminating fiber trunks on patch panels.
 Everything is home run from each IDF to the MDF, there are no IDFIDF trunks.
 We’re terminating on duplex LC patch panels.
 The tech doing the termination and I are at loggerheads about how they should terminate. He says they always terminate them straight through (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, etc), but this means we will have to either stock different types of patch cables (crossed and straight) or mess around with rebuilding the duplex LC at one end of the patch cable.
 I’m saying they should be terminating with crossed pairs (1-2, 2-1, 3-4, 4-3, etc) which would allow us to use crossed patch cables everywhere, whether we’re connecting switchswitch within the rack or switchpatchpatchswitch.
 Is there a best practice to this?

                              <span>Hello! 
 I am really hoping for some help and guidance here.. 
 So a little bit of background about my environment. 
 I am currently updating my company&#x27;s switches. I purchased one Cisco 9300 to use as my core switch and then two 48 port Cisco 9200 switches to use as access switches.
 We have about 50 computers and Polycom VV350 IP phones and I have a eSXI host running a domain controller. 
 I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have the new switches and eSXI host running in a “test” environment so I can get this figured out before implementing my entire infrustructure, but everything is currently working in our production network. Ive been doing a lot of trial and error, but mostly errors.... 
 I don’t have a CCNA and Im not very fluent with Cisco, so Im wondering if there is a way to set this up from …</span>

 I entered a password including a quotation mark and a percentage symbol („ and %).
 The password doesn’t work when logging in.
 I know how to reset the switch to factory defaults. But a) I would like to not have to configure all the VLANs again and b) over the past decades I have encountered such problems with old networking equipment. A few times there were alternative ways of getting back in when „bad“ special characters where used. Once replacing it with an ASCII code worked and once I could truncate the password up until the bad special character.
 Anybody know a way or know any restrictions?
 Thanks for deleting my last post by the way. Top way of moderating.

 We have just refreshed the Palo Alto firewalls, and gone SASE with Prisma Access. Each branch office has a routed ipsec tunnel to both data centers. These offices have cisco 2960, aerohive APs and clustered Palo Alto 220/440 series firewalls.
 In each datacenter we have about 6 nexus core switches in VPC, and two ASR1001 as edge routers. Each data center has two ISP’s. Finally each data center has a F5-cluster and a Palo Alto cluste…</span>

                              <span>Recently, we have received complaints from customers regarding slow wifi in a specific section of the floor. Upon checking in Cisco DNAC, I found that the wireless access point (WAP) the client is connected to is showing high noise on the 5GHz spectrum. I changed the nearby WAP into sniffer mode to capture the traffic on the same channel as the WAP with high noise. I now have the packet capture in Wireshark, but I&#x27;m unsure of how to diagnose the problem. I tried searching for a solution to this problem on Google but didn&#x27;t find anything useful. Can you please guide me in the right direction? 
 I have temporarily placed the problem wap in down state

 PowerPoint, Excel, PDF etc., seem to open fine.

                              <span>Let’s be real, the job’s pretty similar place to place. Servers, firewalls, Office 365. Some places are always tough to do it in - lawfirms, non-profits, MSPs. 
 What are some of the best industries to be a sysadmin? Users are smart, budget is thick, projects are your own. I’m in healthcare consulting at the moment which is pretty smooth.

 Looking for suggestions. Having only worked at msp&#x27;s prior, neither of us have a healthy idea of what a good schedule looks like.

                              <span>Long story short, I was laid off about 2 months ago and have been looking for a job since. I have about 3 years experience working in help desk and a Jr. Sys admin role.
 Last week, I had two interviews with a small (less than 30 employees) MSP and I thought it went great, both interviewers seemed like good guys and the job would be challenging but I would learn a ton so I was very interested. After the final interview on Thursday, I was told to &quot;probably expect us to reach out soon&quot;.
 Lo and behold, I missed a call from them the next day at 7:30pm, followed by a text from them asking me to call them back when I was available. I text them back about 15 minutes later (when I see the missed call and text), letting them know that I&#x27;m currently out with friends and will call them back on Monda…</span>

                              <span>Hi!
 I want to force 2FA for all users and are searching for a nice USB desk stand.
 The goal would be a very heavy desk usb hub or usb extender or a keyboard with well accessible usb extender.
 How do you solve this? There are lots of small desk stands, but I could not find any really heavy ones (especially in europe).
 Thank you for your thoughts ITStril

                              <span>I’ve been working in IT for nearly 8 years now. I’ve gone from working in a hospital, to a MSP to now fruit production. Before I left the MSP I thought I’d hit my limit with IT. I just feel so incredibly burned out, the job just makes me so anxious all the time because if I can’t fix an issue I beat myself up over it, I always feel like I’m not performing well. I started this new job at the beginning of the year and it gave me a bit of a boost. The last couple of weeks I’ve started to get that feeling again as if this isn’t what I want to do but at the same time is it. I don’t know if I’m forcing myself to continue working in IT because it’s what I’ve done for most of my career or what. Does anyone else get this feeling because I feel like I’m just at my breaking point, I hate not looking forward to my job in the morning.

                              <span>Morning all, happy Monday! 
 Looking for some advice. We had previously removed the Windows 11 bloatware (Climpchamp, ESPN, Tiktok, Instagram, etc) from our Windows 11 Start menus using the follow group policy settings:
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Do not show Windows tips&quot; (Enabled)
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off cloud optimized content&quot; (Enabled)
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off Microsoft consumer experiences&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Do not suggest third-party content in Windows spotlight&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off all Windows spotlight features&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off the Windows Welcome Experience&quot; (Enabled) 
 This was tested and worked fine, implemented last month and worked fine. Now this morning I am seeing all the bloatware is back, even though my policies are in place. 
 Am I missing a setting, or is this crap finally unremovable? 
  
Edit: Found it, fixed it. Now to test and implement. Check the comments below. Thanks all for contributing!

                              <span>Hi fellow members, I need help with my OpenSSH Server app on my Windows server. OpenSSH is up and running. I can connect to the server from my remote client. But now I need to connect from Netsuite using RSA key but Netsuite doesn&#x27;t accept keys without a passphrase. I tried all possible ways even ChatGPT but all failed. I know how to create RSA keys with a passphrase. What I don&#x27;t know is how to force OpenSSH to accept new RSA key with a passphrase. Please help?

                              <span>Fairly new to an organization and just learned that on-prem AD and O365 do not sync. We have about 400 O365 users, of which 150 of those operate in one of our offices and are built in AD. This means that those 150 users technically have two different set of creds, even though they are likely the same. Apparently, it&#x27;s been like this for years and no one really knows why. Is there any reason you would not want it to sync? What are the potential downsides or gotchas if we were to sync? 
 It seems like syncing would allow for better password management, one place to manage at least some of the users (150 on-prem), better integration with Windows and syncing onedrive, etc. Anything else big to use as a benefit?

 At my previous company I have successfully manually remediated the &quot;Windows Security Feature Bypass in Secure Boot (BootHole)&quot; vulnerability on many Windows servers, however, I am tasked to do it for a few servers at my current company and for the life of me I cannot get it to work. I complete the steps from the Microsoft recommendation documentation on this page:

 ...however, I am facing the following error at the last set of running the Set-SecureBootUefi command:

                              <span>Good Morning,
 This past week I started to see an issue where some client machines on our LAN will acquire a link on a switch but its MAC address is not put into the MAC address table. This causes the machine to appear online to the user but it actually isn&#x27;t. Intranet and Internet are inaccessible. The only way to fix it is to reboot the machine. Disabling and re-enabling the NIC doesn&#x27;t appear to work.
 We have some older switches admittedly... Cisco SG500X-48p running latest firmware, set up in stacks with 4 member switches for each stack. I&#x27;m receiving complaints from users in two different stacks about this issue so I&#x27;m not sure if its happening to others at the moment.
 When a client machine can&#x27;t connect, I log into the switch they&#x27;re connected to and search for the client&#x27;s MAC add…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 For those of you that have taken out cyber liability insurance policy, aside from this being a checkbox that corporate is looking for, from a technical perspective what sort of (if any) engagement do you have with the insurance provider?
 Has there been any sorts of onboarding calls with the provider to go over the claims process in the event of a cyber breach? Things like what we need to be prepared with before making a claim, etc.

 We have been able to do this Beyond Identity setup on Android, Mac OS, and iPad with no issues however, when we try to enable biometrics on Windows PCs that are domain joined it wants us to set up a pin and use the Microsoft authenticator app or go through our two-factor authentication provider. 
 Does anyone know of a way to just enable biometrics locally so we can integrate it with Beyond Identity without going through the entire integration process with the cloud etc?

 anyone have recommendations for a white/silver sharpy (some cables will be black)? I see oil based sharpy, something tells me that might not dry.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have a small company I am supporting in IT related topics. One of the users has a lot of spam mails incoming. Do you know any client solution that doesn’t necessarily need an email gateway installed? It could cost a few euros, that’s not a problem.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello,
 I wasn&#x27;t sure where put this post , at r/sysadmin or r/programming, so i decided write here.
 I am 18 yo and I&#x27;m in an IT technical school so just starting my way in IT.
 I have a dilemma because I don&#x27;t know what path to take. I&#x27;m very interested in systems administration,networks ( I passed CCNA) etc, but I also really like web programming (js and python html,css, etc). I&#x27;m graduating from technical school in a year, and I don&#x27;t plan to go to college just study in my own. I would like to ask you guys for some advice, because I totally don&#x27;t know what to choose and focus on something. I don&#x27;t want to do and learn several things at once, because it doesn&#x27;t benefit me much.

                              <span>So this happened. A long lost laptop was found in the company that was thought to be part of a rather large security incident we had 2 yrs ago. We really like to access the laptop.
 This is the case:
 - Boots successfully to the windows 10 login screen
 - Computer has bitlocked enabled, Bitlocker key itself is unknown however.
 - Computeraccount was removed from the domain and can not be restored anymore.
 - Because of this, no domain admin or other domain account works.
 - Previous user shown on login screen has unknown password, no other cached domain accounts.
 - Local admin account on the laptop is likely disabled and has an unknown password
 - BIOS is accessible
 We are most interested in a login to get the bitlocker key to enable decrypting the forensic backup.
 I&#x27;m really stuck here. Any thoughts?

 I manage an infrastructure composed of a main site and 10 secondary sites of small size (1-5 users)

 I have the choice between 2 providers who offer me
 ​
 Stormshield SN210 for the main site + SN160 for the remote sites
 or
 Zyxel USGFlex 700 + USG20 for the remote site
 ​
 Which one do you choose ?

 ​
 Recently i&#x27;ve set-up Passwordless Sign-In using Microsoft Authenticator for my organization. This works perfectly for all services connected to the users Microsoft Account. 
 I&#x27;ve tried looking into a way to use the MS Authenticator app as a Sign-In method for InTune enrolled devices (Windows 10/11). Does anybody know if this is available with the current MS Authenticator app?
 Thank you very much for any replies!

                              <span>Hi
 I have a question about a scheduled task
 If you have a scheduled task to run on a timer and the timer is one hour from the time the scheduled task is created. What happens if the user shuts down their machine before the hour ?
 Does the scheduled task never get to run? Does it run on next log on or next time the machine is turned on?
 The trigger is :
 Run powershell script after 60mins 
 Not after workarounds yet or different ideas. Just troubleshooting some that dont run and I want to know why first
 Thank you !

                              <span>I have inherited a Unifi Wifi network which uses RADIUS to authenticate computers onto an Active Directory domain. 
 Problem is, nearly every single laptop does NOT connect to wifi (v6) until the domain (or local) user logs in, and this is killing some, not all, of my GPO. 
 As an example, I set a GPO to add a local admin on laptops. That works. But if I try to deploy an .msi it fails miserably, with error logs telling me the network wasn&#x27;t available. If I run GUPDATE, it fails with the couldn&#x27;t complete message, in that it knows there is an .msi in waiting type of thing. 
 GP Result shows the policies are being applied to the local endpoint.
 I can give more detail when I am back in the office on specifics. 
 If I plug the laptop into the network (physical cable) the .msi deploys without issue, so i am relatively happy that I set the GPO up correctly. 
 I am not entirely sure RADIUS authentication is set up correctly on the DC, but if I am honest, I am a bit stuck where to look, or more importantly, how to check. 
 I have set the network to wait, and the laptops now take 60secs to boot to a Windows log in screen, but the wifi is disconnected, so it&#x27;s pretty pointless having wait for network in place! 
 As mentioned at the beginning, I have inherited this, and there has been an absolute ton of work required to roll out an RMM to approx 150 laptops, much of which I&#x27;ve had to do via Powershell due to the .msi failing, plus other work to get the estate where it needs to be. This GPO thing has taken a back seat, but it is nagging at me to get it fixed. 
 I could leave it now i have an RMM in place, but I would prefer to fix it and have it working as it should so it doesn&#x27;t bite me in the future. 
 I&#x27;m posting this from home on a public holiday, so don&#x27;t have specific information to hand, but will gladly respond with any info when I am back in the office. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>A candidate who is going to have a software development interview with my organization private messaged me on LinkedIn requesting to ask some few questions from me -i assume its to do with the interview, what to expect, technical environment, tips etc
 I have not responded to him, but I feel this is not right.
 I&#x27;m not part of the interviewing or decision-making panel, and i didn&#x27;t even know about this upcoming interview -but i usually prepare the test computer which will have the practical tests or activities when im told to do so i.e just installing programs, dev environments, user profiles etc
 Should I alert my boss(who is part of the interview), ignore her, or hear what she has to ask
 On the other hand i just wouldn&#x27;t want someone to lose an interview opportunity that could transform their life and that of their loved ones over something like this, i.e. if the candidate gets disqualified before the interview (it&#x27;s just my little caring heart).. Maybe they mean well, or maybe they want to gain an unfair advantage by seeking insider information

 I’m having Sip phones authenticate from the Netherlands, even though I’m in Australia.
 Lots of my users are apparently logging in from the US from their home network, also had a few from khazakstan…
 Any fixes apart from exclusion groups on CA?

                              <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m a tier 3 Sysadmin who has been supporting Windows for 6 years and more recently, Solaris for the last two as my primary OS. I&#x27;m looking at a job right now where I would need to swap from Solaris to Linux as my primary OS as I escape legacy software hell, and I just wanted to ask; has anyone made this swap before that can give me advice?
 I&#x27;m pretty confident with Solaris and do a good amount of bash scripting. What&#x27;s going to be similar between Solaris and Linux? What&#x27;s going to be different? Are there any pitfalls I should look out for or handy courses I should take?
 Thanks in advance!

In the past I would just supply old iPhones and loaner laptops that would be wiped upon return. Wondering if there’s a better way to secure these users while keeping them somewhat productive. What is your go to combo of phone/laptop when traveling to countries like this?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve completed the shift to be 100% cloud and have no need for on-prem AD anymore. We&#x27;ve disabled AD Connect via the Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false command and uninstalled the agent. We also ran Okta sync and uninstalled that agent as well. 
 We have Okta upstream as our profile source and users are federated with that. Everything appears to be operating nominally but AAD still has some remnants of on-prem AD. It shows Password hash sync, Seamless single sign on and pass-through authentication as enabled (this is after 72 hours of running the command). Running a Get-msolcompanyinformation shows the DirSyncService account name and PasswordSynchronizationEnabled as true but DirectorySynchronizationEnabled is set to false.
 Will that change/disappear over time or are there other things that need to be done to remove them?
 Also, does anything officially need to be done with on-prem AD? We are moving offices and have no need for the current network either so things like DNS and networking aren&#x27;t a concern. I think it&#x27;s as simple as shutting down the servers and scrubbing the hard drives but am wondering if there&#x27;s a step or two that&#x27;s missing.

                              <span>Good morning,
 I&#x27;ve been a long time Zabbix user for monitoring. Though I recently discovered an issue with my Zabbix that basically means I need to re-install the whole thing. And that amount of work has made me question if I I should go a paid solution.
 What are people using to monitor servers and networking. And what do you manage.
 I am testing PRTG, and when I did a scan of a VM I started wondering, what do I actually need to check on a VM, is just space of drive and some services enough?
 Cheers.

 Maybe even someone there that knows you, or knows someone you know, and presumably has the ability to locate a person&#x27;s activities. See that they visit certain favorites or habits or wherever.
 Is this realistic in any sense, like for someone who lives in a smaller town? Is anything stopping some random ISP employee from seeing what you do online if they choose? Is it de-aggregated in any way? Or is a VPN truly necessary for all activities, not just special ones...
 I worry that VPNs aren&#x27;t truly secure. You&#x27;re passing the puck to the VPN server host, and even then how do you know your VPN isn&#x27;t leaking or dropping out for a split second? I have never been able to trust in VPNs.

                              <span>I need assistance configuring an Enterprise Wi-Fi setup for a client of mine. This is a scenario I’ve done a few years ago in the past, though it seems newer security settings on Windows don’t make the exact method I used possible, and I’m not even sure if the configuration I’m attempting is possible in a secure manner anymore.
 I have access to 
 NPS on Windows Server
 Unfi Access Points
 Active Directory
 ADCS is set up, computers &amp; users are set to auto enroll certificates. User certificates should be unique and are stored in AD so they will roam from computer to computer.
 Is there a way to have enterprise Wi-Fi set up so that when a domain joined computer boots, it authenticates to the Wi-Fi networking using the machine account (via certificates or any other manner), then when the user logs in, the Wi-Fi then authenticates as the user.
 I’ve been able to get one or the other working, but not both – client needs both because there are computers that do not have a ethernet connection that need to be managed even when users aren’t sitting at them. Ideally this will all be transparent to the user and use their credentials/certificates in the background.
 This needs to work for a user that has never signed on to the machine as well – and ideally I’ll be able to filter the users that are able to access the network (eg WORKSTATION1 always on at the logon screen – Bob can log in to WiFi, but Alex cannot as part of their AD Group Membership)

                              <span>Company decided that 20 people in India are better than 5 people in the US and cut the entire US IT team.
 They gave us a couple months notice to train our Indian replacements which sucks but it is what it is.
 I really like my job, but I’m starting to realize I’ve hit a ceiling and if I want to go beyond basic help desk and basic sysadmin stuff I need to learn more.
 Right now I essentially am a T2 help desk guy, I do manage some more advanced systems but it’s basically the annoying stuff that nobody wants to do (cert renewal and management is the big one).
 If I want to move into a 100% sysadmin role what should I be learning while I have the resources at the last three months on the Job? 
 Any help would be appreciated

                              <span>After months of working as a freelancer, I was able to land a remote Sysadmin job at a reputable (or so I thought 😡) company. 
 One month ends and I am sent a layoff mail and also being told I will compensated 3 months severance pay if I sign a Mutual Separation Agreement which I did. 
 I was actively applying for jobs then I get a call from my former manager one saying that there was a change of mind and my role will be reinstated if I choose to go back to work and also there’s been a reshuffle of the entire IT department and my redundant role will now be under infosec team. 
 I am confused on whether I should get back or just continue looking for a job at a different company? The pay there isn’t bad $65,000/yr.

 Windows Offline files has existed for some time now, but it seems like the feature hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed much of the years and there are of course numerous instances of people commenting on how janky it can be or that recommend to avoid it completely.
 Additionally, documentation on the feature outside of the quintessential use case of employees accessing their files remotely is somewhat sparse, and I&#x27;m somewhat confused if I&#x27;m able to configure it in certain ways as some options seem to rely on AD or the files being hosted on a machine running Windows Server.

                              <span>Hello Sys Admins,
 I&#x27;m a run-of-the-mill shared hosting customer looking for advice: 
 For years, I had Barracuda&#x27;s email gateway security product, sold through my hosting company, and I was always happy with it. Covered all email addresses on all domains, and I could still manage email accounts/forwarders from cPanel with the gateway kind of invisibly in the middle. 
 During the last year, Barracuda bowed out of the small-fry market and my ISP directed me to &quot;professional email services&quot; from titan.email which has not been great at all, and in some respects is absolutely awful (for reasons I&#x27;d be happy to share if anyone cares).
 Anyhoo, are any of you aware of a relatively affordable email gateway security service for someone like me? Between titan and spam assassin, I don&#x27;t seem to have really good choices.
 Thanks in advance...

                              <span>My last few companies have been using google workspace and ive always found it so much easier to manage vs Microsoft 365.
 We use Google Sheets/Docs/Google Meet a lot for our collab and video conferencing but lately we’ve been having a vendor convincing my director to migrate to M365 / One Drive / Teams. 
 I find M365 to be extremely clunky and diffficult to manage. Is it just me or ya’ll feel the same?

                              <span>Hello, basically title tells the issue.
 I been transferring client&#x27;s domain from BT to GoDaddy. As a company we have our own WildWest portal with GoDaddy where we usually transfer our other client&#x27;s domains to.
 So it seems that the issue has happened when we gave BT a wrong IPS Tag (to a newly created GoDaddy account rtaher than to our WildWest portal.
 Now it has been almost 60 days and the transfer still has been stuck &quot;in progress&quot;
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Over the last few years I feel like I&#x27;m in a constant battle of having to justify:
 •Why I need to make changes out of hours in a Production environment.
 •Why I can&#x27;t walk out during an Incident to do chores.
 •Why I can&#x27;t give an answer on how long something will take.
 This has only become worse since switching from a hybrid to WFH role, I try explaining it to my family but they have little understanding and the cycle repeats itself.
 Does anyone else find themselves in a similar situation and how do you handle it?

I do hold a Hong Kong permanent resident card and have full working rights in HK, In Australia I have a full working rights visa for 5 years during which I will get the permanent residency. I want to build career in IT and maybe start my own business after like 5-7 years of experience. I came to Sydney as a student in 2017 and did my bachelor of Network security. started working as service desk in 2020 and went back to HK the same year and worked as IT consultant, learned SCCM, PowerShell and a bit of Azure on that role, came back to Sydney a year ago and started working on level 3 support.
 I need advice on if I should continue my career in Australia or should i move back to HK. The tax is really high In Australia compared to HK.

                              <span>Traditionally, computing has been deterministic, which refers to the inherent consistency, repeatability, and provability of outcomes in data processing. This is because the output strictly adheres to the programming logic (code written by software developers).
 #LLMs leverage similarity search to process information. During the training phase, LLMs identify similarities among text tokens and create an extensive neural network to capture these patterns. These patterns are then represented in a high-dimensional vector space, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of textual data.
 When processing user input, input sentence is converted into a vector. The OpenAI model then searches for the nearest tokens in the multi-dimensional space, using the shortest distance as a measure of similarity. There is no developers doing the coding to write different logic. Each sentence is following same vector search process.
 Below I show how a sentence is transform into a vector. The model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) in this example is using 768 dimensions. OpenAI has its own API endpoint that do similar processing (text-embedding-ada-002) with 1536 dimensions.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 some info about the systems : its HP,RICOH,Konika Minolta,Lexmark Printers, all of them sitting on the same VLAN dedicated to printers and have static IP address. We use 2016 print server.
 The issue, Printers keep going offline randomly and the only solution to wake them up is to disconnect the network cable and connect it back.
 Lets say out of 12 printers it keeps happening to the same 5-6 printers.
 Now I have disabled SNMP in all of the printers but seems it didn&#x60;t help, they use RAW and port 9100.
 I have checked sleep settings in all of them but you cannot disable it completely.
 We have ALCATEL switches and everything is managed by other company.
 My question is anyone had any experience with this kind of problem?
 maybe the issue is with the configuration on the switch ports since other printers don&#x60;t have those problems?

Ever since starting IT I can’t remember the last time I had a decent 8 hours of sleep. Even on weekends I wake up at 6am naturally panicking I’m late for work.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I was given about 50 IPs, most are Windows servers and some other devices, and need to quickly identify information about those devices, such as what services they are running, who the owner is, etc. Basically do a bit of detective work on them 🙂. Is there a quick way of automating it? I have the AD domain administrator account. I put together a quick powershell script, but I am new to PowerShell and it doesn&#x27;t work as it should. Basically, it should go through the list of IPs, connect and login to each server and export to csv services that are running along with hostname. Can someone recommend either an already made tool for that, or a better script/solution? In case someone asks to check against inventory, or monitoring system, I don’t have access to those (not sure if inven…</span>

                              <span>I used to frequent this reddit pretty often, but it&#x27;s been quite a while since I&#x27;ve stopped in (related to both personal and professional reasons).
 Last time I was here, there was a lot of talk about the death of the &quot;traditional sys admin&quot; and how everything could be infrastructure as code soon.
 It also seemed that many were predicting the death of the data center and &quot;everything&quot; would be SaaS and/or AWS based soon.
 So I am curious:
 1) Is the traditional sys admin role dead?
 2) Is the physical data center dead?
 3) Did the infrastructure as code revolution actually happen?

                              <span>So like most people my age I have never really done pots...... But I guess it&#x27;s basically just Ethernet with 4 wires.
 But long story short I traced the ports and wires to the location on the com closet and all of the wires are aggregated to a punch down block? Then they go to some grey wire that looks one of those old db25 cables 
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out what this cable is for.

 also what happend if i went for something currently not supported like SG550x??

 I&#x27;m recently started learning about datagrams and IP header and I&#x27;m confused for now. To be specific, If we&#x27;re sending datagram without fragmentation, I wanted to ask in which fields router is going to change their contents?
 I know that (I would post a picture of ip header but I can&#x27;t) IP header constists vers, hlen, type of service, total length, ident, flags, fragment offset, ttl, type, header checksum, source IP address, destination IP address, IP options, padding and beginning of payload (data). So again, speaking of regular datagram sending without fragmentation, in which fields the content will be changed?
 ​
 Also, what is the difference if we would do that with fragmentation?

                              <span>So I got this small bit of &quot;what&#x27;s best way to implement this&quot; for a small business.
 There&#x27;s 3 WAN uplinks, from different providers - main one&#x27;s fiber, second&#x27;s through a point to point wifi high speed link and 3rd one is a last resort SIM modem with static IPv4.
 There&#x27;s no ISP support to run a dynamic protocol on either of the 3.
 R1 must dial a PPPoE connection with auth, then receive static IPv4 on pppoe1 interface. Same for R2. Both can also get a /48 IPv6, but that&#x27;s for another time. R3 has a static IPv4.
 Magic question here being: what dynamic protocol could be used between each of the 3 &quot;R&quot; edge routers and FW1 so that:- 0.0.0.0/0 is redistributed, but removed from advertisements should the PPPoE link fail- order priority remains the same (traffic flows through R1, should that fail, through R2 or - finally - through R3 as last resort)
 Initially thinking running IBGP between FW1 and each R router, but with a default originate, the session will always put 0.0.0.0/0 in the session no matter if the link is up or down, or with a &quot;redistribute connected route-map X&quot;, with route-map X permitting just interface pppoe1, but I&#x27;m pretty sure such advertisement won&#x27;t include the 0.0.0.0/0 in it.
 Any other alternatives/protocols just for the default route ?
 From a vendor perspective, all items involved - R1,R2,R3,FW1 - are Linux machines (VMs with NICs in passthrough mode), so any dynamic protocol supported by FRRouting is a go.

                              <span>We currently use a mix of Catalyst switches, most 3850s (and some 9300s and some older switches).
 We have about 200 access switches in total in the environment. We are looking at replacing about 150 of them in the next 2 years.
 One of my team members wants to go full Meraki. We already use their APs and their MX firewalls. 
 I and others on the team are resultant as we sometimes have needed more advanced policy-based routing and such on the Catalysts. On the other hand, we have a mish-mash of versions, routes, etc across the environment. 
 Would a full investment in Meraki make sense, or are we tying our own hands?

                              <span>Greetings:
 My company previously rented a Meraki from an MSP that managed our switches. When we went with a new MSP, they advised we purchase a Fortigate 80E. However, in so doing, we lost the ability to manage our switches without factory restoring them (the first MSP took their secrets with them). The next MSP that sold us the Fortigate always said they would get around to restoring our Cisco switches but ... well, they are out ex-MSPs for a reason.
 So, our company decides to move everything internal. Updating the network is my job. Our physical footprint is shrinking so we have some extra switches. I restore a Cisco SG300 to factory, patch/upgrade it move it into production as a replacement for an in-production, unpatched Cisco SG300 (like-for-like). 
 The Fortigate was config&#x27;d to do all the heavy lifting. It does all the routing, hands out IP leases, etc. 
 So here is the problem. The updated/patched Cisco is installed and up and running. Switching like a champ except it is not appearing at all in the Fortigate ARP table. Further still, the Fortigate keeps giving it an IP address that has already been assigned from the DHCP pool. When I attempt to take DHCP out the equation and assign the Cisco a static IP by MAC address it does not work because the Fortigate never gives an indication it sees the switch (no entry in the DHCP table, no entry in the ARP table). 
 I suspect there must be something misconfigured on the Switch but I can&#x27;t access the gui without a reliable IP address. I can access via console but I am not physically there until monday.
 So, in the interim, any ideas? I am sure its something simple I am missing but sometimes the simplest thing is the easiest thing to overlook.
 Thank you!
 EDIT: I’ll add that the web gui on Cisco was verified as working and it received a unique IP when it was not connected directly to the Fortigate.

 This post got away from me so TL;DR version: SysAdmin at new company. Office 2016. Not hybrid as told. MSP in Germany 100% controls and manages on prem AD, print server, network management, security and software/hardware deployment. I don’t even have Read type access to any of that. Expected to nickle &amp; dime my time with manual clock punches. Future M365/Azure AD plans call for migration to NEW MSP to handle all aspects of it. Prev MSP will still do the rest. Told there is no real structured help desk. This isn’t normal right? 
 To start, I can’t 100% put the blame on this company or the people involved in my hiring process. I didn’t ask the right questions and was too nonchalant about the whole thing. I was looking for a change and this was one of those late …</span>

Just wondering if anyone else may have some experience in how long this will take. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey gang, I have ended up wearing the IT hat in our small business (10-20 employees) and have a question as we&#x27;ve run into a bit of an expansion/growth problem :)
 We have a program we need to run to manage our projects which runs on windows and only within the LAN. This is great except a large percentage of our staff use Macs and work outside of the office (don&#x27;t ask!). Our current solutions is to have a bunch of desktop PCs running Splashtop (similar to TeamViewer) within the office so people on macs/working remotely can splashtop in and run the application.
 While the Mac users can boot-up a VM and run the tool via VPN we find that process is way too slow compared to just jumping on a Splashtop machine and opening the app (and requires them to be able to set up and manage a VM+VPN).
 This works ok but we&#x27;re finding it&#x27;s clearly not scalable or efficient.
 ​
 Does anyone know if MS/someone else offers a terminal server product that would be able to host multiple remote connections and instances of the same application at once? Alternatively is there a recommended method for having a server run say 6 VMs each with their own Splashtop instance? I imagine this clearly requires a special MS license? Is there a way to do this with Azure so we can scale it up and down?

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;m looking for a little help finding some settings. It looks like our RMM software has locked updates on our servers, which our infra admin found out when he went to patch today. The same settings have been in place on our workstations, and I was able to find the settings enumerated in the updates menu there. I just can&#x27;t find them in local gpo or the registry.
 I&#x27;m not sure I can post the screenshot of the settings, so I&#x27;ll just type them out here:
 Disable automatic updates Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Get updates for other Microsoft products Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable check for updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable Pause updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Set Automatic Update options Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy 
 Everything in local GPO under Templates\Components\Updates is set to not configured. A few articles online advise going through and turning on all the Windows 10 Telemetry settings, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the fix here. Thanks in advance.
 Edit: screenshot in the first comment.

 which Tools make your SysAdmin Life easier?
 I mean light weight Tools which help you for example to better organize your self or saving time at repeating tasks or store your clipboard history or automatic type your daily needed password and so on...

                              <span>I get it, you’ve had KFC / Subway / fish and chips for lunch, feel a bit of pressure in your stomach and the toilets are being cleaned at an inconvenient time. But for crying out loud we have a balcony, hell take the disabled toilets if you really have to but the network cabinet’s ventilation is not as good as most people think it is (lost count how many times I’ve complained to facilities about that). Depending on where you release, the smell can linger and mature. I had to show one of the AT&amp;T engineers to the networking cabinet in Friday and the smell was so bad I had to apologise and keep the door open for a good 10 mins before he was comfortable enough to work. 
 The worst thing is that this is not the first time this has happened, it’s the 3rd!!!!. I swear to God I only have 2 months left in this hell hole but I’m going to make it my life’s mission to find out who the serial cabinet farter is if it’s the last thing I do. Even if I have to suspend everyone’s security badge, I do not get paid enough to write an email to my staff on a Tuesday to reserve farting at a better more considerate place, can’t imagine how that’s going to go down.

                              <span>We have used MSPs at our business (75 employees) since before I started here 12 years ago. I manage everything on the backend (NAS, VOIP, door access, etc), but I don’t have time to keep up with the workstations so it works. The MSP provides a security package for the users, handle printers, updates, and a few other odds and ends. We switched MSPs last year because of some interpersonal conflicts and the new company looked great. They had a nice portfolio, interviewed well, tickled my ears with a solid “we know this is your network we’re here to help”, AND they specialized in our business type. Part of their contract outside of their maintenance agreement was an AP upgrade for the building. They sold us on a UniFi system and we deployed. A few days go by and I start noticing some weird dropouts in a few different places so I put in a ticket for them to check the auto-negotiation of channels and see if the UDM recommended any changes, etc. crickets Two days later I follow up with an email crickets 3 days later I email the account manager and reply was “I don’t see anything on our end, if you have a minute can you log in and see what you see?” I let him know that a login wasn’t created for me yet, but I’d be happy to. I get the invite, accept, and my jaw hits the floor. The manager had given me access to every one of his accounts, with full admin, AND access to their other customer’s financial backups that they vaulted for them. Needless to say that was our last week retaining that company.

                              <span>My company is going to replace a couple dozen laptops and we have a policy to destroy the hard drives because of the potential privacy/security ramifications. I’m wondering if it’s worth donating the machines despite not being in ‘working order’ or if having them recycled would be better. Anyone have experience going down either path? The machines are like 4-5 years old and decent quality for that age of machine so still lots of life left in them.

                              <span>Hey there, former sysadmin turned pentester here. Recently, in almost every environment, I&#x27;ve been able to privesc from a regular user to Domain Admin using AD CS vulnerabilities.
 I definitely recommend running Certipy or Certify (compiled binary) to see if you can identify any vulnerabilities in your environment. As far as I know, this stuff won&#x27;t come up on a Nessus scan. I know when I was a sysadmin I set this up insecurely (has now been fixed). However, AD CS is easy to set up without knowing some of the security implications of the configurations.
 The guys over at Spectorops who came out with their paper on attacking AD CS (Certified pre-owned) also have a good talk on &quot;ReCertifying Active Directory Certificate Services&quot;.
 Edit: I linked both Certify and Certipy earlier. Certify is a windows application. Certipy is based on python. I prefer certipy. If you want to run certipy it’s pretty easy. One way is to setup a Kali VM. Download that here. 
 Then next through the Kali install. If it pulls dns and up from DHCP you should be good to go. After you’re in, open up a command prompt and type 
 pip3 install certipy-ad 
 Then run
 certipy find -vulnerable -stdout -u lowprivuser@domain.local -p password

                              <span>I am now about to shop for a new monitor for my home computer just will no longer turn on, and that monitor (a Sony) had served me very well for a little over 17 years.
 For comparison, computer monitors in a work environment get replaced every 3-4 years.
 How long have you had your current computer monitor and have you had any which lasted more than 5 or even 10 years?

I looked in the system event log but no new event is created on monitor wake up.
 Since the computer locks on sleep, my plan B is just to set the monitor and computer sleep timeouts to the same values, but out of curiosity I&#x27;d like to know if this is possible first.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 With all the recent redundancies which have been going on I’m one of those who have been affected. At the risk of disclosing too much I’m in a management position but don’t have much technical skills anymore and was hoping for some general career advice and CV writing tips. Im pretty much getting butchered in a lot of interviews because I’ve “lost touch” with tech in general :(. 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
 Edit:happy to send my CV across via chat, I’m mainly playing this carefully because of my NDA

                              <span>Hi, right now I am unable to login (locally) on my Win10 workstation. I see the &quot;spinning circle&quot; but it definitely hanged.
 I have OpenSSH server installed on my workstation, so I&#x27;d like to try solving the problem without rebooting (which will definitely works!)
 I just killed all my Firefox&#x27;s processes with taskkill, shutdown a couple of Virtualbox VM machines (which were running totally fine!).
 I just noticed that tasklist is unable to complete, it stops at
 ​
 System Idle Process System Registry smss.exe csrss.exe 
 Powershell Get-Process is working fine (it shows all processes).
 If it happened to you, how would you approach it?
 Forgot to mention: I am also unable to login through RDP

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I&#x27;ve seen a lot of talk about veeam here and have taken the plunge into testing it out. I&#x27;ve started getting everything set up and will test backups further down the road but thought I&#x27;d ask y&#x27;all first before spending too much time. 
 I&#x27;m looking to backup Azure vms running MSSQL, and those servers have separate managed disks containing the MDF, LDF, and daily backups. Would veeam for azure also backup those managed disks or is it just going to grab the vm and it&#x27;s OS drive?

                              <span>So in the past I&#x27;ve mostly developed custom solutions using SharePoint with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, as well as calling the SharePoint API. 
 I&#x27;m consulting for a company and so far I&#x27;ve talked only to the non-technical guys. The non-technical guys told me that their in house engineering team &#x27;overcomplicated&#x27; the process by adding a lot of if/else conditions, etc. The engineering team hasn&#x27;t written any documentation, so I&#x27;m not inclined to believe that the process that they came up with is the most clear and easy to follow. At the same time, if the process was super simple (setting up a SharePoint form, automating tasks with Power Automate and Power Automate), then the non-technical team could have just used the drag and drop interface and do it themselves. It&#x27;s sort of a typical issue where the non-engineers don&#x27;t understand exactly what needs to be done on the technical side, so they think the issue is way more simple than it actually is. 
 I&#x27;ve been asked to come up with a recommendation for the best path moving forward and I&#x27;m not super sure what to suggest. I&#x27;m leaning towards starting from scratch, writing custom JavaScript when needed, and then of course, writing clear and easy to use documentation. 
 Part of me wonders though if the hardest part of this whole workflow is simply working through all these very domain specific edge cases. I can foresee issues down the line where the people giving the directions / exec team doesn&#x27;t have a good understanding of their current systems, yet they&#x27;ll still want a very specific result. 
 I guess my question is what to &#x27;recommend&#x27; for next best steps that gives the exec team confidence in my recommendations, and also reduces the headache / back and forth nitpicking that I am anticipating with the exec team?

                              <span>Have you noticed recently SaaS providers are pushing extremely hard for additional sales. My company have multi-million dollar contracts with SaaS providers and they all exhibit the following behavior:
  
Enterprise support downgraded to basic support. Start pushing &quot;Enterprise Plus&quot; support plus for advanced support.
 New feature sets that provides marginal improvements to Security, UX, Workflow, etc... Now an Add On, on top of your Enterprise License.
 We let go your dedicated CSM and triple you up with another CSM. This CSM comes in doesn&#x27;t know much, doesn&#x27;t keep promises of the old CSM, and pushes twice as hard for add on services.
 Your assigned enterprise technical architect that provided you recommendations and project work, he/she is too busy right now. Your CSM schedules him/her 2 weeks from now because of increase in workload AND reduce the hours available. (Before it used to be a few days, and as many hours as you reasonably need). THEN THEY TRY TO SELL YOU EXPERT TECHNICAL ARCHITECT SERVICE TO FILL THE GAP.

It will run just a browser to connect to our erp, so I need very basic specs (Ram 4 GB, Disk 8/16 GB, ethernet connection, fanless). OS is not required, as I will install a a light linux distribution (porteus).
 Can you suggest some cheap models available in Europe?
 Edit : added details about OS I will install

                              <span>We have a new building going up (and other building works) at work which means new fibre being installed and existing fibre being cut and spliced.
 Looking at getting some basic fibre fault finding/troubleshooting tools to help with (just had this happen this week) &quot;the fault is with your equipment&quot; after fibre cutting and splicing has been done and said network was working right up until the point of the new joins being terminated into the comms rack.
 Anyway, looking at the Fluke (totally open to other options) FiberLert and VisiFault and if I should get both or just one or even something else totally.
 What I *think* we need is just a basic visual fault finder that shoots a light down a link but would like to hear from others what they recommend that onsite teams have/use for fault finding/troubleshooting before calling in professions.

                              <span>I work at a medical office with an in-house hosted EMR, and I&#x27;ve been tasked with improving the slow and inconsistent internet, phone, and fax issues. I&#x27;ve spent a ton of time researching and configuring, but this is far beyond my self-taught knowledge. I&#x27;d appreciate having a more skilled set of eyes look over what I&#x27;ve configured. Priorities are uptime and reliability. There are 10-12 staff on-site at a time and 10-15 patients. The site is about 2000 sqft. The owner isn&#x27;t fond of monthly fees or lengthy contracts, so I have to have reasonable justifications for those, but he is willing to spend on capital purchases. Here is what I&#x27;m currently working towards:
 Phones:
 Vonage 11 VoIP phone extensions| $310/m | 24 month contract

                              <span>We are in a process of resubnetting the whole network and we have mgmt vlan for as it says management. We do not have much on prem hws (40ip would be more than enought) and our contractor said if its separated from everything else it wouldnt be an issue to use it for iscsi and nvme over tcp.
 Whats you opinion on this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning ISIS and have an IS-IS Lab in EVE-NG and I&#x27;ve run to something that has me stumped. 
 I have 4 routers in the lab. R1 is Cisco and R2, R3 and R4 are Juniper. The topology is basically 
 R1&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R2&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R3&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R4
 I have configured VLAN 2 on an SVI on the Juniper and Cisco switches, with trunk links between them. I can ping all the way from R1 to R4 with no problem. 
 Routers 2, 3 and 4 all have adjacencies to each other. R1 only has an adjacency to R2 but &#x60;show isis neighbors&#x27; shows R3 and R4 as being in the INIT stage. I&#x27;ve checked the MTU, even changed it and I&#x27;m getting the same behavior. I&#x27;ve put my configs below, and I&#x27;m hoping the experts here can point me in the right direction, what am I missing here?

 Here’s the quick version of what went down. He was Help Desk admin, so he had some admin-level credentials and access to a fair few systems with risk and trust involved. One day, last week, he had a user reach out to him after-hours, needing admin credentialed approval for a software update on their laptop. Now, either out of sheer laziness, lapse in all judgment, or a weird crush he had on this user, he decided that rather than remote into the user’s laptop, type his creds in to get the update pushed through, and call it a day… he simply gave the employee his admin-level username and password over a Teams chat message.
 To say this irritated me when I…</span>

 Amazon Bussness has a form where you can provide details of a project and they will give you a custom quote on huge quantity of something.
 I can&#x27;t remember what the minimum is for a large quantity quote but I think it is truly meant for large enterprise rollouts. For example: 10000 Sticks of 16gb ddr4 ram or 10000 iPad cases.
 (Also open to other suggestions of of a good vendor to buy a large quantity of ram from and suggestions on the best brands.)

 While replacing his power strip I see one of the plugs is electrical taped. Yup, someone, maybe him, bought a power adapter from goodwill for $1.99. One side of the electrical cord had broken at the strain relief so the genius had electrical taped it so that it mostly made contact. It was the power cord for the monitor’s power brick, so I can only imagine when it would lift, power would get pulled through the hdmi cable and, zap! He’d get a shock. 
 I don’t know why this monitor has a goodwill power adapter?? People will “solve” their own problems in fantastically stupid ways.

                              <span>Remember just a couple of weeks ago Microsoft proudly &quot;committing&quot; that their apps would use the same common supported methods for pinning and defaults? That they &quot;believed&quot; they had a responsibility to ensure user choices were respected? That they &quot;understood it was important&quot; that they lead by example with their own first party Microsoft products?
 Well...
  
Web links [...] in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge. [...] A similar experience will arrive in Teams.
 Links will open in Microsoft Edge even if it is not the system default browser in Windows.
  
Because fuck respecting user choices and leading by example. Gotta continue pushing Edge no matter what.

                              <span>My company purchased a building recently, and inherited a Honeywell access control system. The company we purchased it from had a ProWatch server that is now disconnected. Until we can decide on new floor plans/layouts and then rip and replace the access control system, we&#x27;re currently stuck with the badges that we got from the old tenant. 
 We&#x27;re running out of badges at this point, and I was hoping to be able to get connected to these controllers and add/change some badges. It&#x27;s not a pressing matter yet because very few people have moved in, but as we start doing construction and the like it&#x27;s going to get complicated. 
 We&#x27;d really rather not pay Honeywell for their ProWatch software only to replace it 6 months down the line. Anyone have any experience working with these systems outside of the way Honeywell intended? If we&#x27;re stuck then we&#x27;re stuck and we&#x27;ll deal with it. Just looking for options.
 Failing this I may just get a badge cloner and some re-writables.

                              <span>Hello, Our department recently was given a couple free racks. However, we use vertical mount PDUs. This picture here shows how they attach, with the kind of &#x27;hook on PDU slots downward with weight/gravity into hole in rack&#x27; - I don&#x27;t know what this mounting connection is called, if it does have a formal name.
 Unfortunately, the new freebie racks don&#x27;t have this socket-for-a-hook that our existing racks, APC units, have. Instead they have these odd square holes surrounded by small circular holes. Problem: I also don&#x27;t know what this is called so my Google-Fu is lacking.
 I know that attachments like this exist where you consume 1U or 2U to add horizontally-jutting out attachments which adds these sockets, but I&#x27;ve worked with those before and they really take up a lot of space in a rack that I&#x27;d rather be using for network cables (gone are the days of one cable per physical host, hah). Also we put our Cisco switches at the top of our racks, exactly where these horizontal add-ons would go.
 So instead I&#x27;m wondering if any of you know of an item that can attach into those square holes in my picture, to add a round socket so I can hang my vertical PDUs. Or even just the terminology, so I can at least do more effective searches.

I am friends with several people there still and I hate to see such a vulnerability in the wild that could affect them.
 Do I just drop it?

                              <span>I manage a service that uses Cloudflare to protect services for about 300 customers. Not a big fish, but big enough to spend a few thousand $ per month and have a dedicated customer success rep. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the new team that was assigned to me, and I wonder if it&#x27;s a widespread issue, or just the luck of the draw.
 Recently, a lot has changed at Cloudflare:
  
They reorganized things to downgrade their baseline enterprise support, and make you pay for the &quot;premium&quot; level that used to be the baseline. That&#x27;s fine- I don&#x27;t need that much support. And I was honestly surprised at how much handholding they gave me before.
 The Customer Success team turned over a few times before I could even meet them. Again, that&#x27;s fine, and understandable if Cloudflare is shaking things up.

 The issue is that USB audio devices with microphones attached directly to the laptop will show that no microphone input is available. If you are looking at the old Sound control panel, you will see the microphone entry but no level meter off to the right.
 The fix was to rollback the driver to the previous version, in our case .6815 version.

                              <span>Cyber security is tough. Patching, incidents, email spam among my other sys admin duties. Today i was forwarded an email by account asking if the email was legit. It had made it pas all our safeguards, looked legit but the person in accounting noticed the from email did not match the normal sender. 
 While picking the email apart it was indeed a spoofed email with a .PDF malware attachment. Caught by a keen eye, the security training we&#x27;ve done and the test emails are working! 
 Anyway through my dissection of the email i was able to track it back to the company that owned the domain and found that it was a compromised O365 account. It was a doctors office in NYC about 90 minutes from our location. 
 I thought &quot;Great i got their contact info let me just give them a heads up to have their IT look into the issue.&quot; Let me tell you this did not go at all how i had hopped it would. 
 I called their office and asked to speak with the Doctor running the practice or the office manager. After a moment on hold i got to speak with the office manager. I explained who i was, what company i was with and relayed my contact info should they need to follow up. I then explained that we received an email from their O365 portal and that one of their accounts or possibly their whole O365 account was potentially compromised and they should speak with their IT team to investigate. 
 I don&#x27;t know if i sent this poor persons brain into overload or what but as soon as i finished talking they started to berate me like i was somehow the person that compromised their systems. I didn&#x27;t want any recognition i just wanted to do the right thing and let them know of the possible breach. But instead all i got was about 3 minutes of angry Karren before they simply hung up. 
 Any one else come across something similar? Try to do the right thing by letting someone know only for it to fall on deaf ears or worse?

 In comes a user.... They need help with a printer. And it&#x27;s important... They need drawings for Tuesday morning and Monday is a public holiday
 It&#x27;s an HP inkjet... 525 A0 plotter!!
 That they have moved three buildings, different subnet altogether. And they didn&#x27;t get it in until they saw that it was raining.. with paper roll exposed ☹️
 And of course when I&#x27;ve managed to get the soggy papier mache out it had empty ink cartridges 🤬

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious as to the community&#x27;s thoughts on this.
 Our helpdesk is regularly inundated with tickets about Excel, usually along the lines of &#x27;Excel is freezing or crashing&#x27;. It&#x27;s almost every case, it can be narrowed down to a few standard culprits:
  
3rd Party Add-in (for us it&#x27;s an add-in that pulls data from our ERP - Dynamics or JDE)
 Spreadsheets linked to 30 other spreadsheets, of which half the links are usually broken
 Macro or VB issues
 Some frankenstein spreadsheet with quarter-end balance info that&#x27;s been in use since 1997.
  
Our finance team gets frustrated because they always come running to IT, but realistically there&#x27;s little we can do, because 95% of the time it&#x27;s not really an actual PC or app problem. We endlessly communicate this, but of course people come to see us regardless.
 We&#x27;re thinking of implementing a policy of not being able to support Excel.
 Curious how you all handle &#x27;those excel issues&#x27;.

                              <span>I remember back in the day it was a big deal to make company wide changes. At what point did Microsoft decide they were in control and know what&#x27;s best for our companies?
 Case in point: They release &quot;Roaming Signatures&quot; and push it out, without asking, and without warning.
 So now I&#x27;m creating a company wide GPO to disable it because its completely borked our signature systems, and in our field our email signatures are extremely important.
 I find myself more and more often having to setup stuff to block things MS has just decided to push out.

                              <span>I have one windows 11 device that will not allow me to connect to it using RDP unless I set the security layer to RDP. 
 The specific error I get when it’s set to negotiate or SSL is “Server message: AADSTS293004: This target-device identifier in the request “name-pc” was not found in the tenant “our tenant ID””
 When looking at the RDP logs I see where TCP read and write fail. And after setting the security layer to RDP, I connect directly to the device but am at the computer login screen VS the window that usually pops up authenticating me to AzureAD before allowing any access to the PC. 
 I’ve wiped the PC to no avail. Any ideas what I can do to further troubleshoot or remediate the problem?

                              <span>Having a debate with coworkers about Specops settings. We can ban dictionary words, but also set a minimum length for a passphrase. My assumption is that when the policy sees &quot;Chocolate14$&quot; it contains a dictionary word, and is not allowed, but if it sees &quot;Ilikechocolatecake365!&quot; then it sees it as a phrase. My coworkers contend that the presence of any dictionary word means the password is non-compliant, so the passphrase setting is conflicting and useless.

 Here, I&#x27;ll take you through my journey with Morgan Stanley, discussing two different interviews:
 1️⃣ After completing my Master&#x27;s in Computer Science, I interviewed for a Junior Developer position when they visited our university for campus placements.
 2️⃣ A few years later, with 3+ years of experience at the Royal Bank of Canada, I applied for a Senior Developer position through LinkedIn.

 I feel like disclosing my ADHD/ASD is a problem and instead of being asked to give my side of things and the benefit of the doubt, it&#x27;s easier for family, friends and colleagues, etc to make assumptions. 
 I have been told I have behavioural and communication issues and at school I got bullied for being different.
 A usual trend is or was people usually start conversations with &quot;a couple/few people have mentioned/ told/ brought to my attention...&quot;
 When I&#x27;ve tried to explain myself or seek clarity they&#x27;ve assumed I&#x27;m trying stuff on.

                              <span>Hey everyone. There is a Dell Precision tower that has ubuntu loaded on it and is used by our developers. Someone tried updating cuda and it basically caused the SSD to not boot to the OS. A ton of error messages appeared. To make a long story short, I went into recovery mode, removed all NVIDIA drivers, cleaned it and booted to the OS with no problem. Once we rebooted the machine again, it reverted back to the previous state of not booting to the OS and now I&#x27;m not able to get to the recovery mode. I ran a ton of commands and can&#x27;t get to recovery mode or to the login screen. So what I did was imaged another SSD and removed the old one. 
 My question is, is there a way for me to get the data off of the old SSD and load it onto the newer SSD? There are a few very specific files they&#x27;re wanting off of the old SSD, which will save them time in recreating everything from scratch. ORR would it be ok to connect the old SSD as a secondary drive and they get to the files from there while the tower boots to the newer SSD??? I&#x27;m just trying to figure out the best way to go about this and I&#x27;m by far not great with Ubuntu; it&#x27;s too sensitive..lol. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 Is there a way that can I monitor which specific version of Powershell is being used? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone, you&#x27;re my (pretty much) last resort as I am looking for a solution to this problem for quite some time now.
 Our small non-profit currently does not have dedicated E-Mail adresses, our members use their own (personal) E-Mail adresses (gmail, yahoo, you name it). I&#x27;ve set up some forwarding e-mails, e.g. finances@ourdomain.com to the personal adresses of our members. This is not the best solution since every position is occupied with at least two persons and everyone gets a copy of the E-Mail. In total we are talking about around 10-14 people/users and a total of around 6 shared inboxes.
 The next step was looking for an MS Exchange with shared inboxes and automapping to outlook. We cannot use the official O365 due to GDPR restrictions of our governing body and would have to use an on-premise solution. Microsoft does not allow for shared inboxes on mobile devices under on-premise hosting. All the available workarounds I found online (enabling insecure IMAP connections, enabling the deactivated user in the Exchange panel) are not allowed by either the hosting company or violate Microsoft licensing terms.
 So the next thought was several IMAP accounts. No usually as an admin, I&#x27;d have to give the shared account credentials to everyone involved. I stumbled upon the Nextcloud Mail App which allows for multiple mail accounts, maybe that&#x27;s a solution. I&#x27;ve already posted this idea in the /r/Nextcloud subreddit.
 Do you have an idea concerning this matter? All in all, I want several users to connect to the same mailbox via their personal PCs (they use Outlook there) and their mobile devices (they either use a Mail App of their choice or I could talk them into using a separate app if neccessary).
 I&#x27;m really at loss here, hoping to get some ideas :)

                              <span>Over the past few weeks we have noticed odd behaviour with MS more specifically EXO. Our latest complaint is safe emails are now all of the sudden going into quarantine. We are a mortgage company and our users do business with many 3rd parties. Emails were flowing with out issue up until recently. Communication between our users and external 3parties starts out as it should, then for some reason the detection methods go crazy and quarantines the emails. Its becoming a headache to monitor the quarantine, release and report/submit false positives to MS. In the past 30 days we have submitted over 500 emails as false positives. On the MS doc for Secure by Default, it states that this cannot be turned off by admins. And the percentage rate is low for false positives. I dis believe this as we are seeing a high impact. I have done some tweaking by adding these domains to safe senders list but this has little resolve as some of the messages are marked as High Conf Phish. While reviewing the report in quarantine for these emails nothing is being marked as a threat - attachments, urls or images . All pass. No campaign or other indicators except for &quot;Advanced Filter technology&quot;. I have turned off &quot;mailbox intelligence&quot; in the filters but that has done nothing. I have opened a ticket with MS and its going no where fast. I have even shared the article they have published on Secure by Default and highlighted that part where it states safe emails are being marked as phishing. Anyone else experiencing this headache?

 I&#x27;m in charge of my first power down for all our systems today, usually there are a couple of us taking care of these, this is the first time I&#x27;ll need to down the MSAs. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve lost my Googling skills, but I realised I don&#x27;t have any GUI for the MSA, so how do I turn them off?
 I can&#x27;t find an answer anywhere and the manager is unavailable for contact.
 We have x1 2040 and x1 2060.
 The only reference says just hold the power buttons down, but that can&#x27;t be right?

 We have an AD user that is not a member of Domain Admins group anymore but he is still able to log-in into domain controllers and add other users to the group Domain Admins within a tool &#x27;Active Directory Users and Computers&quot;. User doesn&#x27;t have local admin permission on domain controller.
 We&#x27;ve tested this scenario on brand new user but without successful reproduction.
 Delegate Control is saying that user doesn&#x27;t have permissions &quot;Write members&quot; on Domain Admin Groups.
 Have any of you been struggling with such case? Where we need to start looking?

 I live in Iran and there are severe inte4rnet restrictions here so we all need to use VPNs for our daily usage,
 We cannot use TOR or any subscription based VPN that is operating outside of Iran, so we need to setup our own VPNs.
 I Need to buy a VPS and run WireGuard on it so I can create VPN profiles on it and onwards I will distribute these profiles among people.
 I need help choosing a provider that is reliable enough for using them as a VPN, I cannot spend a lot of money on this VPS so please keep the suggestions to the budget category.
 I am sorry if there are any Grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language.
 and I need minor help regarding the specs of the said VPS I haven&#x27;t fully understood how strong of a VPS I would need to purchase.
 Thanks guys

                              <span>For context - I am a Linux guy. However, my brother owns a small manufacturing business that uses Windows tablets on the shop floor. As you can imagine, in that environment, the average lifetime of a tablet is not great. The other gotcha is that I am remote and have been setting these tablets up for him remotely - He connects them to the shop floor wifi, I do the rest.
 So what I&#x27;m looking for is some software (Free, paid, whatever) so that I can create a master image from one of these freshly set up tablets and then either write that to USB or maybe deploy via PXE (Not sure if the tablets can even have their boot order changed, so that may not be possible). If there is some software that can create a &quot;Plug in the usb stick and walk away&quot; image, that would be best as he&#x27;s highly non-technical.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>now i have i pretty laid out gov job where i develope internal tools and manage like 20 pcs. the pay is decent, i have a lot of free time to read books, think about hobbies, browse the internet, get into stuff like indie game dev, and its close to my home. the second job that i get offered pays around 15 to 20 % more but its a lot more work less free time, and pretty much 90% work where the other job is like around 50% so its not that fullfiling (maybe less lol im maxing stuff here). so pls guide me what do you think.
 should i take the switch (and make my life around my career). or should i stay and do something on the side (im thinking about indie game dev) and if u can tell me about anything good to do on the side to get me a hobby that pays that would be great. and thanks.

                              <span>Hello boys and girls,
 I would like to ask for your knowledge and help on finding a software that meets my needs. The case is as follows: in the next week I&#x27;ll acquire some 1500 used laptops. Most of them are in unknown state and I need to perform some diagnostic and reporting on it. I imagine something like setting up some network boot environment as I have enough space for connecting some 20-40 laptops at once and boot them up. After performing the diagnostics I should have a saved report somewhere. Also if there is an option for wiping the laptop would be a big plus. As always, if it&#x27;s open source, it would be better.
 I don&#x27;t seem to be able to find anything useful and I would appreciate your input on this. Thanks!

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t find any better place than this if it&#x27;s ok?
 So i have some drives encrypted with truecrypt. Haven&#x27;t uses the drives for a couple of months, but have the password written down somewhere
 I connected the drives to my windows 10 pc
 Tried login in with password... says it it&#x27;s wrong
 Started to look for some information, some are saying, when this is happening, the partition could be damage
 After a while of thinking, i tried something i did not find, my partitions does not have any letters, but can been seen in any partition program, my solution to get truecrypt accept my password was following
  
Open diskmanagment
 Selectet your hidden drives and add letters to the drives
 Then a pop up windows says the drive needs to be formatting, ignore that, close down pop up window
  Remove the letters you added to your hidden drives
  Now you should be able access your hidden drives through truecrypt
  
At least my drives wasen&#x27;t damaged
 But why did true crypt not find my hidden partitions in the first place? It did months before?

                              <span>So in 25ish years in IT I&#x27;ve always worked places that bought their desktops outright and I&#x27;ve had zero experience with leasing equipment. Yesterday I was chatting with a friend whose company just signed an agreement to lease 300+ desktops for 3 years and he shared that the agreement stipulated they had to return the equipment in the original boxes at the end of the lease. It still blows my mind a little and I&#x27;ve been processing it for almost 24 hours.
 Is this kind of requirement a normal thing in equipment lease agreements? If so, is it something vendors actually enforce? If so, how in the hell do companies store hundreds or thousands of boxes with packing materials for years? It sounds wildly impractical to deal with this.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 Do you have any tips what to check when one users Mac prints in isolation mode?
 ​
 The setup is that we have a print server setup and printer driver is installed locally there, we add the printer in Mac by adding it as Windows printer via spools. We have added it the same way on other computers and it works fine but for one user it won&#x27;t work.

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been discussing this with Mimecast themselves and they keep redirecting us to the Blocked Sender and DNS Authentication policies.
 What we are trying to determine if possible is, can we configure Mimecast in such a way that it would choose to honour a DMARC policy that has hold or reject configured, but have it ignore any policy with a none option set and then apply our own override?
 I can appreciate the issues this is going to potentially cause with valid business email being blocked as not everyone has DMARC correctly configured (hell, our sister companies don&#x27;t!), but we are looking at this as purely a technical discussion right now. Mimecast&#x27;s solution is to have manual intervention and have us manage the blocked senders list by adding domains in response to events such as a phishing attack. That&#x27;s not a valid solution for us. We are discussing and looking for a purely automated solution here.

                              <span>Hi
 I built DATA CENTER with central DC&#x27;s VM that holds the DNS services and the RDS license services, and under it, I made all the VM&#x27;s with Tree Trusted Domain (with realm Trust Type). Each VM gets its RDS license from the DC directly (through GPO redirect to the RDS license server&#x27;s IP); sometimes, the VM drop from the RDS license server; I should enter the Remote Desktop Licensing Diagnoser, renew the connection to the RDS license server, and resupply the credentials!
 How can I reserve the connection to the RDS server? Is there any other method that can resolve my issue?
 Do I have to add a universal group with RDSadmins that can cross the trusted forest, and which appropriate&#x27;s group should it be in the DC server?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys,
 So we are using Aurora MySQL for our production.
 Once in a while, we need to manually do some data manipulations in the database. In these cases, one of the approved senior engineers who has privilege log in to a production container and run the queries required. Users who log in to the production environment are logged and recorded, however, there is no record of what they did. Maybe they did some data manipulation or maybe not. But there is no way to know it.
 How do you guys record these? Or what is the best practice for cases when manual data manipulation is required?
 Cheers.

                              <span>I’m extremely frustrated , please excuse my rant. I joined IT pretty late in my life, was 29 when I landed my first Helpdesk gig, 1.5 years later got headhunted by Microsoft to join their Helpdesk, made it to manager in 3 years from agent to supervisor then manager and yesterday got served my 3 month notice for redundancy. I’m based in the UK and I’m seriously disappointed. My comanager was barely around (constantly disappearing, never showing up to the office to look after his kids, taking weeks of sick leave) so I had to pick up on his slack and do the work of 2 full time managers. Even though we report to the same manager, I complained about him several times but my manager said there’s nothing she could do thanks to employee rights. Me being me, I constantly worked 10 hours a day as well as evenings, weekends, took my work laptop with me while I was on vacation to Spain and Cyprus. People see my success and obsessive nature but I sacrificed a lot, my girlfriend left me, I’m the fattest I’ve ever been, my cholesterol levels are through the roof and I’ve developed extremely painful haemorrhoids to where I almost passed out from the pain in the office bathroom. I get out of breath when tying my shoe lace! Now on top of everything I’ve been made redundant. 
 I don’t have anything left in the tank to do anything more, I bombed my last interview as a manager for a fintech company and with only 1 years managerial experience it’s doubtful I’ll get another manager gig. So by the end of all this I’ve ended up a sad fat lonely burnt out idiot who sacrificed literally everything to get to absolutely nowhere. Argh!!!!

 Apologies if this has been answered before, I couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for as I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it.

 They all think tickets are just a way for us to not take them serious, and they tell me why should I put in a ticket?
 What is your experience with this issue? Do they all just create tickets?

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all! I started working for a small nonprofit and I&#x27;ve been tasked with improving their network infrastructure. Currently, all their main network is in one main building and it&#x27;s branching out to 2 separate buildings with an outdoor CAT 6 cable that is just hanging through the roof (it goes through trees as well). Of course, the internet in the outbuildings is very poor, barely reaching 50mbps while the main building has speeds of ~500mbps. 
 I&#x27;m proposing using Fibre optic cable underground that goes from the main building to the two outbuildings. My plan is as follows:
  
Dig a trench of about 18-30&quot; deep. 
 Use PVC for conduit and pass armored pre-terminated single mode Fibre optic cable through it. 
 The ends will be connected to media converters to convert the optic signals both ways. 
 The media converters will then be connected to the router with an ethernet cable and from there to the switches. 
  
In yalls opinions, is this a sound plan? Am I missing anything or not taking into consideration something? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We have 2 datacenters, connect by 4 switches and 100Gbit trunks. We found out that the 100Gbit trunk is limiting our network performance. We place 2 servers 1 in each datacenter. Each server has a 100Gbit network card but 40gbit dac cable. We can only reach 30gbit instead of 39/40 bit with iperf. When the servers where directly connected they reached 39/40. Does anybody know what is going wrong ?
 The connection is like this
 Server -&gt; 40gbit -&gt; switch -&gt; 100Gbit &lt;- switch &lt;- 40gbit &lt;- server
 All switches are dell S5232f We ordered 100Gbit dac to check what will happen on that speed.
 Maybe someone has had the same problem before?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Earlier today I found out about this interesting problem i just can&#x27;t wrap my mind about.
 We recently purchased new big ass Palo Alto firewalls for DMZ/Internet Access.
 Declared Threat Prevention throughput is over 120Gbit/s appmix. Our Internet connection is 100G.
 We&#x27;re not done with the migration yet so we&#x27;re pushing through roughly 2Gbit/s atm.
 We&#x27;re doing SSL decryption on all HTTPS traffic over the standard and a few not standard ports.
 I had two incidents open from our colleagues who reported huge performance hit while working on VPN and downloading specific files. Upload was fine.
 Went on to check myself and I was able to reproduce it on quite a few sites that are inspected.
 These guys who reported the issue also captured a speedtest image of a known speedtest site …</span>

 I know VyOS, FRRouting, Mikrotik, Linux...
 I&#x27;m thinking of testing/using SONiC... any other ideas?
 It is a traffic that more or less 10Gbps
 I need IPv6, VXLAN, BGP, OSPF...

                              <span>Was doing some reading on VLAN 0 and how it&#x27;s a tag that gets applied to traffic requiring CoS but is not associated with a VLAN. Then it got me thinking: what traffic aside from switch-generated traffic (ie: STP, CDP, etc.) wouldn&#x27;t actually get tagged across a trunk anyway? According to Cisco:
  
A switch may also have to send untagged traffic across a trunk link. Untagged traffic is generated by a switch and may also come from legacy devices. The 802.1Q trunk port places untagged traffic on the native VLAN. The native VLAN on a Cisco switch is VLAN 1 (i.e., default VLAN).
  
So lets say a legacy device with a NIC driver that doesn&#x27;t support VLAN tags is plugged into an Access Port. It sends traffic. An Access Port in a VLAN environment is always going to associate incoming traffic from an end device with a VLAN. To that point, wouldn&#x27;t the traffic get tagged with that ID as it traverses a trunk port? What is it that&#x27;s telling the switch to not apply a VLAN ID? There must be something, no?

                              <span>I work as the sole sysadmin at an SMB (50-100 employees). We have two physical servers running Windows Server 2016 and 2019, both hosting Hyper-V VMs (&lt;10 combined) in an AD environment. We also have a QNAP NAS for file storage. Given the following constraints, which is the least laughable option for backing up my VMs to the QNAP? (If not obvious from the below list, all are free options for me at the moment)
  
Using QNAP&#x27;s built-in Hyper Data Protector tool
 Running Veeam Community on a separate, older Dell PowerEdge 1850 (would be spinning up as 3rd physical server)
 Running Veeam Community as a VM on one of the two Windows Servers
  
I&#x27;m currently backing them up using QNAP&#x27;s HDP, which has been working fine. I&#x27;m a little nervous about its reliability and potential for vulnerabilities though, given it&#x27;s not QNAP&#x27;s main forte and they&#x27;re not the most responsive to fixing them. I thought about trying out Veeam to see why everyone likes it so much. I know running on old hardware is a little risky, but I fear running it as a VM on the same hardware as the rest is riskier. If there&#x27;s another free option I&#x27;m missing here that you&#x27;d recommend, I&#x27;d love to hear it.

 I&#x27;m wondering if you guys have any resources to find what major security appliances, EDR, AV, web filter vendors have added us to their list and maybe even get a category / reason for that block. 
 I&#x27;m basing my assumption on the fact that some vendors like fortigate have a publicly available filter search with the possibility to ask for a review of a specific ip or url like here:

                              <span>Was interviewed for a security analyst job for the second time, I did badly answering some of the questions and the CIO (an old man) looked grumpy and seemed that he didn’t care about what I had to say after the first 4 questions, in fact, he wasn’t even paying attention and was just straight laughing as I tried my best… Although I mentioned I enjoy doing this kind of work, the old guy said it’s not a fun job and will be stressful which I totally understand. However, in the first interview, the recruiter mentioned that he wanted someone to enjoy doing the work and doesn’t want a lazy person who just clocks in and clocks out and treats it as a 9-5 job.
 Should I just withdraw from the job posting rather than getting a rejection email? In my opinion, I felt disrespected and insulted because of this… Although I can take plenty of hits, the job workplace culture seemed toxic, especially because it’s just 2 employees the head of the department and a regular security analyst.

                              <span>Sorry if this is an unorthadox post, but is there a way to get the latest (or last) SPP for older HPE Proliant Gen8/9 servers that are no longer under HPE Support? Getting this from HPE is not an option. Is there a repository somewhere, lets say for &quot;testing and lab use only&quot; that would have SPP bundles for older Gen8 and Gen9 Proliant servers.
 Or is it possible to download the firmware individually from HPE or any other source? My 3rd party hardware maintenance vendor will not provide any firmware - although I know they have it.

                              <span>I work for a hardware vendor. Businesses/customer buy our hardware (multimillion dollar capex equipment), generate petabytes of data on it yearly and they need to get the data from our hardware onto their network for subsequent analysis. 
 Now whenever my company needs to connect our hardware to your network, IT inevitably must get involved.
 The biggest pushback is that my company’s hardware cannot be managed by the customers IT infrastructure whatsoever. (No domain joining, or any kind of endpoint protection). We expressly state in the purchase agreement that the equipment is managed and supported by my company.
 Our equipment is meant to be a single user device and has no need to contact the outside internet. Connecting to any network is only necessary for transferring the data collected. Technically, we have a samba server running on the equipment, and that single (or maybe the small group) of users have the credentials. 
 Would you then describe the equipment as an “appliance” (cannot be managed by policy)?
 Is this a common scenario in your company (you have an outside vendors equipment wanting to connect to your network)?
 What would you require (or assuage your security concerns) from the vendor? 
 In most cases I’ve told folks that they can secure the VLAN (firewalls, routing) by restricting what resources the equipment can access when connected to their network, but it seems like I have to go five levels deep in their organization to get this to happen.

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeing several jobs advertising &quot;On Call.&quot;
 While I know what the words mean, I cannot picture what an On call pay structure is like.
 Is it like being an Uber for helpdesk calls or something? Does it mean that you are paid per call, or for the hours that you are on call?
 Reason I ask is because I have a decent job in another field.. I desperatly want to get into IT and am willing to pay my dues.. but not go into bankruptcy for the first few years that I&#x27;d be entry level. My perfect situation would be a job that&#x27;s 3-5 hours a day that I could work before or after my present job.
 I&#x27;ve tried part time.. what a joke. The part time positions want 40-45 hours a week.. they just claim part time to not pay benefits.

                              <span>Currently, we have a situation where we have a CNX file that connects to a database in a specific folder. I attempted to modify this file by changing the database name and saved the CNX file. However, the saved CNX file still contained the old database name. To fix this issue, I deleted the original CNX file and attempted to create a new one. However, when I tried to save the new CNX file, the file editor showed that the CNX file already existed in the folder, even though I could not find the file in the folder. To investigate further, I created a new folder with the same name as the original folder. However, when I tried to create a new CNX file in the new folder, the file editor showed that a CNX file already existed in the empty folder.
 I am unsure why this issue is occurring, as I have checked APPDATA to ensure there are no old files causing the issue. Do you have any ideas as to what may be causing this problem?
 -Tried searching APPDATA for old information to delete -Deleted the old folder and created the same folder name, but this showed a ghost CNX file in the newly created folder.

I found out today the my techs are manually copying these files to a synology where it then backs up to wasabi. Sure seems like a lot of overhead for something like this.

 Currently dealing with a delicate genius (Seinfeld) who drags on tasks because they are too afraid to ask for help. No type of troubleshooting skills. If they do not understand it, it is automatically considered misconfigured or wrong and should be removed.
 If you dont understand VMWare, its fine. Find someone who does. Dont assume taking a class for a week automatically makes you an expert.
 You know how god awful it is to hear them say how difficult it is to apply a certificate to a ESXi host.

 A lot of them are discontinued. Can anyone here tell me what exactly that means? What disadvantages or problems does that create. Will I still be able to purchase things needed to keep it running? Is buying a good working model that&#x27;s discontinued worth it? Thanks.

                              <span>Posting this here since I work as a sysadmin for a mid-large sized company. A manager for the region in which I live asked if we had a technology vendor for disposal of equipment. I happen to have a desire to do this on the side and had started a very small website/advertisement in my area expressing this. I guess my question is: is there any danger in suggesting my own company as a vendor for my job? Much of the collection work can be outsourced so there’s no danger of anyone really seeing me collecting the equipment.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a Windows system administrator for the past 10 years at a small company, but as the solo IT guy here, there was never a need for me to keep up with the latest standards and technologies as long as my stuff worked.
 All the servers here are Windows 2012 R2 and I&#x27;m familiar with Hyper-V, Active Directory, Group Policies, but I use the GUI for almost everything and know only a few basic Powershell commands. I was able to install and set up a pfSense firewall on a VM and during COVID I was able to set up a VPN server on it so that people could work remotely, but I just followed a YouTube tutorial on how to do it.
 I feel I only have a broad understanding of how everything works which usually allows me to figure out what I need to Google to find the specific solution, but it gives me deep imposter syndrome. Is there a certification I should go for or a test somewhere that I can take to see where I stand?
 I want to leave this company to make more money elsewhere, but before I start applying elsewhere, what skills should I brush up on that I would be expected to know? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Until now I&#x27;ve run all of my servers without a cPanel/WHM solution. Now I&#x27;m getting to the point where I need to spend less time installing/maintaining and more time on other things.
 Wondering if any of you prefer anything in particular over cPanel/WHM?
 Edit
 I&#x27;m a bit of a control freak and like to build my Apache, PHP and MySQL from source. I&#x27;m willing to give that up.

 What is your go to system for a rugged laptop with Cell capabilities? We&#x27;ve been put in a pickle and need to find something relatively quick(in stock sku). Usage is fairly light, timeline is tight and ethernet/wifi is abysmal at best so looking for something with 4G or 5G.

                              <span>I was working with a department within my organization that is utilizing a vendor provided web app. In order to get SSO to work correctly in MS Edge, we need to add login.microsoftonline.com to the EMIE mode as a neutral entity (open in: none).
 We have several other web apps using that for SSO, so I fear that it could impact those apps. In theory, it shouldnt because it’s neutral, but wanted to check to see if any other people knew more.

                              <span>Hello everyone! We have two HPE MSA 1050s and we want to replicate the data from the first one onto the second one, while keeping both as separate entities. Additionally, our boss would like to be able to access the data and create a backup on an external drive or something. We are part of the maintenance team, but we are not experts in this device, and we were asked to create backups using just the manuals as guidance. We have tried using snapshots and copying volumes, but those methods do not meet the requirement of having a backup that can be accessed from other devices like an external drive (since it only creates a snapshot or volume copy in the disks that belong to disk groups within the same MSA). So the question would be, how can we make this? Is there a way or is it just what it is?
 We know that in case of a disk failure the spares will take over and replace the degraded one, but that it not enough for our boss, he is convinced everything will break at the same time and we will end up losing ALL the data.

 But how do you actually network to get a job? I&#x27;ve asked all my friends, and the responses I get are either &quot;we&#x27;re not hiring,&quot; or (most common response) &quot;I&#x27;m a low level accountant at a Fortune 500 company, don&#x27;t know anyone in IT, sorry.&quot; 
 A lot of my friends are either software engineers, or work in finance. I am looking for IT support and sysadmin jobs jobs. The only friends I have in those careers work for companies which do not have any current job openings. 
 So, how do I get a job this way? It&#x27;s frustrating because I know for a fact I&#x27;ve been passed over for several jobs because someone else had an in.

 I am learning my way around AD and noticed that if an user is logged in to a workstation and needs admin rights for a task, only by typing ‘.\admin’ as the user works but not simply ‘admin’ (followed by the password of course). 
 Could someone explain why?

                              <span>Several customers with Microsoft 365 / Office 365 can no longer use Office for Mac after an update. After successful activation of the Office installation, Office switches back to unlicensed. Trying to activate Office again ends in the error message: It occurs if you&#x27;re already signed in through a different Microsoft 365 user account in the same organization.
 We have already reset the licenses with the License Removal Tool, cleaned up the keychain, removed Office completely, obtained it from the App Store and even installed the previous March version. All unfortunately unsuccessful. 
 Since it now affects three Microsoft 365 tenants, we can&#x27;t be alone with the problem. Does anyone else have similar issues or information from Microsoft? 
 I would be grateful for any hints.

                              <span>My organization is looking at putting Tableau Reader on 1000+ machines. Apparently there is no way to disable the registration page on first launch. Have you found that there is a way to automate the process or eliminate it for the users on a large scale? We need to put this on every machine, and my leadership hates the page. They also don&#x27;t want to have to send/receive data for security reasons if we do not need to.
 https://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/disabling-registration-in-reader
 Note, I have found a way to prefill the registration page with data via registry (HKEY Local User). Not the best answer but at least they would only have to hit 1 button. Anything that we can do before install or before issues a system would be appreciated. It does require it per user login at this time, but only once.

                              <span>Hey all.
 Is there anyone here who has migrated all their compute FROM AWS TO On-Prem?
 We currently have all our servers (AD, SQL, ERP, File Shares, etc.) on an AWS VPC. We would like to bring all that compute back to our on-prem data center. We will be hosting all those virtualized servers on VMWare vSphere.
 I could find a lot of write-up and documentation on how move from on-prem to AWS, but nothing to do the reverse.
 Has anyone done this? What do I need to be aware of? What are the risks? Is there a standard process?
 Hence this post.
 Any and all help greatly appreciated.

 Im looking at MDM solutions for a company about 120 machines, and Im interested in putting it in the mix to see pricing/features, but for the life of me, I cannot find it. I swore I saved it in Reddit, but cannot find it after searching for 20 minutes. 
 Hoping someone can point me in the right direction on this, as I want to give them a fair shake.

                              <span>I&#x27;m one of two IT employees at a small company. In terms of Employees we have probably about 75 and PC&#x27;s about the same amount.
 We are looking into an IT Ticketing/Service Management system because as of right now we have no system to speak of. When users have issues, they come get us, and with the amount of work starting to pick up, it&#x27;s starting to become an issue
 The main features that we are looking for are
  
A Ticketing system (pretty self explanatory)
 A system with some sort of knowledge base so we can centralize our Documentation
 Asset Management to keep track of all hardware that we manage
 Some sort of remote assistance tool that isn&#x27;t VPN/RDP based. (We have multiple sets over an hour apart and it become a real pain when we need to do any sort of support to the other site)
  
What&#x27;s the best way to go about getting all of the features? is there any system/software that has these features(but wont break the bank)? 
 Would it make more sense or be more cost effective if we were to look for multiple tools to do all of these things?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve worked with TopDesk before at a previous job, but that&#x27;s about it for experience with these systems
 Any ideas would be appreciated, Thanks!

                              <span>This may seem stupid, but I&#x27;ve gone into analysis paralysis.
 I can&#x27;t decide how to design the network in a new office. I am going to designate entire /16 for it, but I can&#x27;t decide how to carve out specific subnets. I&#x27;m thinking of doing something like:
 VLAN 10 - 10.50.10.0/23
 VLAN 20 - 10.50.20.0/24
 VLAN 30 - 10.50.30.0/24
 and so on. I can&#x27;t yet decide whether it&#x27;s a stupid idea to let subnets follow VLAN tags, and to left out such big chunks unassigned and unused, or whether I should go with my gut feeling and just do what feels natural and easy to manage overall. I&#x27;m the sole administrator here. We will hire more people for 1st line support in the future, so I&#x27;m keen to keep things simple and descriptive.
 I&#x27;ve always been supporting what&#x27;s already there, adding things into existing environments setup by people before me. I&#x27;ve never had an opportunity like that, to setup a completely new office from the ground up, so I feel paralysed by the sheer number of possibilities. I am clearly overthinking this, I know.

 I would start with a simple request like, &quot;If I don&#x27;t receive an email from Bob by 10 am send him a follow-up to ask about the status of the contract we are working on.&quot;
 I know I have all the pieces to build this on my own but thought I would see if anybody has found something already to do this.

                              <span>Hello sysadmins,
 I have an issue I can&#x27;t seem to figure out. My org had an On-Prem Exchange server that they decommissioned several years back (before my time) when they moved to a hybrid Azure environment. All mail is Exchange Online now.
 When they started syncing users to Azure/O365, they left many of the current employees with a &quot;company.local&quot; UPN Suffix, as opposed to &quot;company.com.&quot; They also left all the msExch* attributes in tact.
 I recently implemented Conditional Access policies for MFA, and they wanted employees on site to be able to use a Hybrid-Joined computer in lieu of the MFA verification.
 So I set that up, but we discovered that it didn&#x27;t work for some users. I found that it was due to the &quot;company.local&quot; UPN discrepancy between local AD and Azure (which had &quot;company.com&quot; as the Azure UPN). I switch the suffix and it fixed the CA issue.
 Director says to move everyone to the correct suffix to make it work, so I did that. Since the UPN&#x27;s match, every user&#x27;s msExch attributes are linked correctly in Exchange Online. 
 Users now show this error in the admin.microsoft.com portal, under their Mail tab: This user&#x27;s on-premises mailbox hasn&#x27;t been migrated to ‎Exchange Online‎. The ‎Exchange Online‎ mailbox will be available after migration is completed.
 These user&#x27;s already had a mailbox, and it seems that most of them have no issues using mail still. We did have one user who&#x27;s mailbox disappeared, I removed the msExchMailboxGuid and other related attributes from their local AD account, and had to remove and reassign their Exchange Online license. This created a new mailbox for them, but it is a fresh mailbox and does not have any previous mail in it.
 I changed the Sync Rules in AD Connect to push NULL out for the msExchMailboxGuid for all users, and it did sync the NULL value for everyone. But the error is still there over a day later.
 Is there any way to resolve this without losing everyone&#x27;s mailbox?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I am currently trying to pass 5 NVMe disks to a storage VM as a passthrough device. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find the right option in the BIOS that allows this. The NVMes are attached to this controller: &quot;HPE MR416i-a Gen10+&quot;. Of course I didn&#x27;t create a logical drive and the disks are marked as JBODs.
 I know from an old server that you can mark the NVMe as PT-Enabled and then you can select it as a PCI device in the VM settings.
 Does anyone have any idea what the appropriate setting is and where to find it? Thank you very much!
 Regards,
 Chris

                              <span>Been working in IT for over 25 years and I think I&#x27;m done. Got into it by accident - I was good at Excel, and moved up via tech support, service desk management, architecture, general jack of all trades and eventually into Senior Sys admin roles.
 Tbh I just don&#x27;t have the interest anymore - I&#x27;d rather be doing something practical and more creative and maybe even, and I never thought I&#x27;d say it, something that involves more interaction with people. Has anybody successfully transitioned to a different type of role. What skills would you say are transferable and what skills sysadmins usually posess have you found employers appreciate in other roles?

 The main task is to mask data in a testing environment. Virtual Data Pipeline (VDP) is not a mandatory feature.

 Most of time or at early time, this was quite straight forward to follow instructions but as the website has been developed with multiple pages, now we need subdomains and custom domains etc. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable updating this so I&#x27;ve been asking to external developers. But I think it would be beneficial for organisation who has a good understanding and for my role as well
 Can someone please share some solid or practical resources I can refer to, it would be super appreciated for your support.

                              <span>Dear Internet people, 
 i am stuck. And kinda out of ideas.
 I need to move some vms from vmware to hyperv. Simple question: how?
 Ive tried a few ways I&#x27;ve found on google but it didn&#x27;t seem to work.
 Anyone of you did something similar in the past and got some tips for me?
 ​
 cheers

                              <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m sorry for what might seem like a dumb question. 
 In my day to day work I make tools for myself in python to make my job more easy and efficient and in some cases enjoyable. some of my coworkers have seen some of these tools and asked to get the tools as well.
 In the past it has not been an issue to use something like autopytoexe to convert my script to an executable that my colleagues could use but as security becomes a bigger concern restrictions on user machines naturally becomes stricter, something, I&#x27;m all for.
 However one of these restrictions is that antivirus now has gone from &quot;I recognize this software as a virus because x,y,z&quot; to &quot;I don&#x27;t recognize this software as a safe software&quot;.
 I understand this move completely as it makes it more difficult to obscure your virus, even if it confuses me a little bit that it doesn&#x27;t treat excel macro&#x27;s and bat files the same (I mean I know exactly why but I find the compromise frustrating).
 Is there a smart way to legitimize a piece of software I wrote for a small team of about 30 people without compromising security or teaching the users that &quot;it&#x27;s ok to open exe files as long as its from someone I trust&quot;?
 Submitting the software for review with our antivirus provider and Microsoft is time consuming and expensive, and I have some concern with installing python on users machines.
 I could make some of the tools web accessible but that adds significant development time and a tool made to start with windows and remind you to stand up once in a while wouldn&#x27;t work as a web application.

                              <span>Hi. I dont see option 7 when trying to configure automatic updates. 
 ​
  
7 &#x3D; Notify for install and notify for restart. (Windows Server only)
 With this option from Windows Server 2016, applicable only to Server SKU devices, local administrators will be allowed to use Windows Update to proceed with installations or reboots manually.
  
Forgive me for being stupid, but my Google searches arent throwing up the reference material im after. From reading it seems that this is specific to 2016 and Im guessing the reason I dont see this option is because my domain is aging (2012 functional level) and we&#x27;re only getting round to upgrading OS&#x27;s now SO perhaps the relevant ADMX files arent there. 
 This stems from an unexplained reboot relating to windows updates on a test 2016 VM - we&#x27;ve been advised to use option 7 ... so I wanted to test this to see what it looks like.
 Id be grateful for a reference to back this up?

                              <span>I wonder how everyone handles users creating folders manually in the OneDrive Company root folder?
 Users are able to create folders in &quot;C:\Users\username\tenant&quot;, and these folders show in the company folder in the OneDrive client, but they&#x27;re not synced. Users can store a ton of documents there and expect them to be backuped, etc.
 Any way to block or disable this?
 For clarification, I&#x27;m referring to the Contoso folder you can find here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-sharepoint-and-teams-files-with-your-computer-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88

 Assume for security &amp; monitoring purpose; I used serial/console ports to connect all the switches to optical converters in a datacenter. I will now Mux/Demux the fiber optic connection to 20/30km remote location. Are my switches secure ? Also is it also a right way to do it?

So my questions is, if im mostly interested in VMware, Veeam backup, storage, Exchange on prem admin, Endpoint protection, is it worth getting a CCNA as first cert? I work for an MSP that does a lot of networking work, so i think it will come in handy..

                              <span>Hi All!
 We&#x27;re trying out CodeTwo&#x27;s MS365 signatures and I&#x27;m going to have to update everybody&#x27;s profile info so that the placeholders can be populated on the signatures. I don&#x27;t want to update all the info within Azure AD and then preform a sync from on-prem at a later date and have it all wiped out (is that correct?)
 Currently there is no sync between our on-prem AD Servers (2) and Azure.
 I was going to setup the Azure AD Cloud Sync but had a few questions I need help with:
  
Am I correct in saying that the sync is 1-way only, on-prem to Azure? So I make all changes on-prem?
 Will there be any interference with our MS365 email accounts once the initial sync has completed, as we use different passwords for AD and Emails.
 Any other gotcha&#x27;s I need to watch out for? 
  
Thank you.

                              <span>A storage pool was using SSD as a cache tier and HDD for capacity, with read-only data. SSD burned out, literally. Is it possible to access the data on the HDD? Since SSD was only a cache for read-only data, all of the data should be on the HDD just fine. But I cannot figure out how to get to it. The data is available in offside backup, so no big deal if it&#x27;s impossible, but would be great to avoid the pain of restoring a massive remote backup, given that all the data should be on the hdd.

                              <span>So a little while ago i set up a few new Windows 2022 Datacenter servers. For some reason the RDP stops working over night for no reason as far as i can tell. Nothing in the event logs. RDP service still running. Firewall is not blocking RDP.
 I&#x27;m about to run out of ideas! Does anyone have any advice?

                              <span>Hi,
 How do I clear the config of a switchport on a cisco switch? I&#x27;ve tried every command on the internet however I am unable to do it. See ssh output below when I try to use &quot;default interface ge20&quot;. I have a teams VOIP phone that seems to add a ton of configuration to a switchport upon connection which I want to remove.

                              <span>Hi
 I would like to force our users to run Edge with English language but I need European decimal seperator.
 I need it to look like this: 1.000,25
 When choosing English US or UK I get
 1,000.25
 which is confusing for the users.
 Directly in Windows you can choose English European which does this correct, are there a similar language in Edge?

                              <span>Hello.
 We have a system that is published as a bunch of RemoteApps on RDS server.
 It was requested to be built for our own users, and is working fine for that purpose.
 Now they have requested another external company gain access to this system as well.
 Any suggestions on how to solve this task? I can&#x27;t imagine creating AD users for every employee from the other company and allowing them access that way through.
 RemoteApps and RDS servers is not a field I&#x27;m very familiar with, so I don&#x27;t know what options I have. I have heard about Azure AD Application Proxy before, could that be a solution or is that for something else entirely?
 Best regards.

                              <span>Are you aware of any company that can do the following: 
  
Supports crawling and indexing file, block, and object storage to extract files&#x27; metadata.
 Supports crawling any vendor’s storage.
 Supports crawling all major file systems and protocols (POSIX-compliant, NFS, CIFS, iSCSI etc.).
 Runs completely on-prem without sending metadata outside of the company&#x27;s environment.
 Crawls billions of files over NFS in an efficient manner without overloading underlying storage infrastructure.
 Crawls and indexes the entire environment on a regular basis such as daily etc.
  
I found few solutions on the Internet but wanted to hear your suggestions and preferably experiences that you had with them.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello, I have come across an issue with our Windows 365 VMs. We have McAfee Proxy installed on our workstations which includes W365 and Physical Devices. We come across an intermittent issue with upgrade issues with our W365 VMs where it fails to upgrade and the logs are not very helpful. We opened a ticket with MS and they stated McAfee Proxy is causing the issue but cannot explain why it is not happening on our physical devices. We tested uninstalling MCP on at least 5 failed VMs and it allows to upgrade successfuly to Windows 11.
 I am checking to see if anyone else experienced this? MS provided me this link today to have them whitelisted in MCP so I will try that step next Connection endpoints for Windows 11 Enterprise - Windows Privacy | Microsoft Learn

I&#x27;ve heard the bank of questions for this exam is pretty extensive and to my surprise that this exam is all multiple choice questions with no actual CLI simulation questions. I was just curious if anyone had taken this exam recently and could verify that? Also, any tips on studying for this particular exam would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a label printer with several specifications, Our office uses Brother printers. Brother being a brand that has worked well for us, wouldn&#x27;t mind having a label printer by them. I cant however seem to figure out which one of their label printers will meet all my criteria. I appreciate any recommendations: 
  
Wireless interface so that multiple PCs can print to the same label printer
 Be reliable and durable
 Able to use generic cheap labels
 Budget friendly (Preferably under $300usd)

 Had a client call in saying their workstation swapped and renewed its IP address which should have been reserved in Unifi and all the software it hosts couldn&#x27;t be accessed. 
 The client is fairly tech savy and had gone to look at the IPV4 setting at Settings &gt; ethernet and noticed the Ip setting said manual. Their theory is the reservation wasn&#x27;t moved to the new MAC address when this workstation was replaced about 6 months ago, and static was set up in Windows.

 I am trying to reflect this by using ncclient. Assuming I&#x27;d be using ncclient.manager.connect.get(), how would I request an entire data model from a device? 
 I have tried creating an xml filter with just the xmlns of the desired model, but that doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Are there any network engineers that have this cert?
 I don&#x27;t need it for work, but I&#x27;m wondering if reading the study guide is worth it to get a better grasp on wireless standards/best practices, etc...
 Wireless in the office is mainly for web surfing and emails and I deal with a lot of pt to pt wireless links for IP cameras in some remote work locations. The pt to pt links are under 1000 ft and as long as the radios are configured properly and have LOS they basically link up and work, but I don&#x27;t understand 80% of the settings in the wireless radio settings.
 I&#x27;m not looking to become a wireless expert, but it seems that there is more to wifi than adding APs and moving closer to the AP. Yes, there is a thing as too many APs, I was just giving an example.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been studying up on MAC addresses recently, specifically the Universal/Local bit that Apple and Android take advantage of for MAC randomization.
 RFC 7042 says:
  
OUIs and longer MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit zero and the Group bit unspecified.
  
But seems to contradict itself one paragraph later.
  
If the Local bit is on, the holder of an OUI has no special authority over MAC identifiers whose first 3 octets correspond to their OUI.
  
In my mind, it only makes sense that all OUIs would be assigned with U/L bit set to 0, however I see many examples of OUIs that have the U/L bit set to 1:
  
02:C0:8C - 3COM
 02:70:B3 - DATA RECALL LTD.
 02:9D:8E - CARDIAC RECORDERS, INC.
 02:70:B0 - M/A-COM INC. COMPANIES
 AA:00:04 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:07:01 - RACAL-DATACOM
 AA-00-00 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:BB:01 OCTOTHORPE CORP.
  
... among others.
 Why is it that some OUIs have been assigned with the local bit set to 1? Is this just a mistake by the IEEE Registration Authority? Are addresses that start with these assigned OUI prefixes still LAAs or would they be considered UAAs? If I&#x27;m generating LAAs, do I need to avoid using these assigned OUI prefixes?

 I want to make sure that when I am installing I don’t exceed the cables bend radius.
 Anyone have any recommendations on bend radius gauges? 
 I found a few cheap ones on amazon which seem like they would fit the job, but I wanted to get other recommendations in case there was a better option.

                              <span>I have an old 3560 that we use as our external router. We finally upgraded our ISP to over 500mbps, so I need to swap the switch out. We have 2 ASA behind that in standby pair.
 I inherited this network, and sure enough I don’t have any internal information on it or what the running / startup config right now, I’ll need to console into the switch to see.
 I have some 2960’s around, but I’m a bit rusty here.
 It looks like it has 12.2(58)SE1-ip-serv-crypto running on it.
  
The “IP-Serv-Crypto” is the Layer 3 routing part of iOS? I’ll need to get a license for the 2960 and flash the new image to just to use one of my old switches on hand if what I’m assuming is correct. But that seems like it would be better to just acquire a new switch.
 
What would you guys / gals recommend if purchasing something new? I’m seeing the new “Cisco Business” stuff popping around.
 
 I appreciate any advice.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing my final year thesis on the performance of some dynamic routing protocols. I&#x27;m using GNS3 for the simulation, I can configure the routers and routing protocols just fine. I however do not know how to measure these performance metrics. 
 I know to measure convergence I need to send ping packets across the network. (Do I count the packet loss as convergence?). can I do this with wireshark (I have no idea how to use it but I&#x27;ve watched a few youtube videos)
 for packet loss, i think I can figure it out with wireshark. however any other help is welcomed 
 how do i measure delay?
 please help!

                              <span>We are a full Cisco shop with 9300 series for most MDF/IDF switches (edge and L3 routing). A few 9500 series as well for our data centers (L3). We were looking into switching to Juniper switches, but looking for what models would be more of a direct comparison. Not sure if 4100/4400 is better for IDF/Edge switching, and 4650 is more of a 9500 replacement. Thoughts?

 Generally, a break-fix case is straightforward in that something is broken and you need to weed out information about the problem to fix it. Most systems are already in place, nothing new (generally) needs to be built/designed, or implemented. Anything new is usually ephemeral, required only for the duration of the troubleshooting, and generally doesn&#x27;t have the same &quot;will this scale&quot; scrutiny applied. 
 I&#x27;m struggling to a degree with the Project side of things where you effectively get a wall of text from a Customer (Requirements, Demands, current/future state, Access required) all jumbled up into a little story with a whole heap of pleasantries, and thinking about how I break this down into something I can track, how I can assign or verify certain pieces with other teams, etc. 
 Right off the bat, Emails and Tickets are a task at breaking down possibly hundreds of small subtasks and requests into something that can be actioned (Intertwined with spelling/grammar and sometimes confusing sentences). 
 How does everyone do it? Do you start with kick-off meetings first, do you try to break down their initial correspondence into something like Trello or Excel and track all of the different points? Does anyone have a system for taking requests, pondering on them for a bit and effectively getting tasks/deliverables and questions from them to progress a project?

                              <span>Hello All!
 I&#x27;m quite new to IP transit and Peering but I have a few questions and if you could confirm if my understanding is correct?
 ​
 #IP Transit
 IP Transit would be to access the provider&#x27;s peers, So for example, if I was with HE, I could connect to Comcast customers but not Comast&#x27;s peers? 
 However, Arelion shows additional peers on the BGP Report? Which means I could also connect to GTT customers?
 ​
 #Peering
 Peering wise, I know peering with content providers like Netflix can be highly beneficial, however, how does it work if you peer with an IP transit provider?
 ​
 So if I peered with HE, I would be able to connect to their customers but not their peers, so no connection to Comcast customers? 
 ​
 #Peering Customers
 Customer-wise, would that be companies that have gotten IP transit with HE?
 If I&#x27;m peering with HE that means to connect to me via HE you would need their IP transit? So would I be considered a peer of HE or is it more complicated?
 ​
 Is that the case for most IP transit providers that offer peering? 
 I&#x27;m not sure if there are some providers that may only peer their own ASN but require IP Transit to reach the rest of their network or customers on their IP transit service.

                              <span>Hi,
 I know this is a long shot but maybe the solution is right in front of my eyes.
 I need to evaluate the number of links needed to interconnect my X routers. While I want to minimize the number of links, I want to be sure that there is a shortest path of at most Y hops and a backup path of at most Y+Z hops.
 I use variables (X, Y and Z) so I can simulate multiple scenarios.
 I have been trying to implement that on NetworkX but cannot find the right way to do it. I suppose it needs a mathematician&#x27;s brain that I do not have.
 How would you solve this problem?
 Cheers

                              <span>Hey all, 
 Looking for a bit of confirmation on something I am trying to resolve with regards to DNS. A number of FW vendors (Fortinet, Cisco, Palo etc) offer a feature where a DNS record can be inspected that the reply amended to provide a different result, for example to give an internal client a different IP address. 
 I am trying to understand which vendors support the translation of the additional records field within an SRV record. It looks like all can successfully translate A records etc. 
 With an SRV record, it will usually contain in the answer an FQDN in the reply. As the FQDN needs to be resolved anyway, rather than wait for the requestor to send another A-Record translation request the SRV record will often pre-empt this and include the response to the A-Record lookup in its additional records data. (So even though the client hasn&#x27;t expressly asked for it, it gets given it anyway)
 Particular interest in Cisco ASA - anyone know if the ASA can translate the information that is presented in the additional records field of DNS?
 Cheers
 J

                              <span>I am working on reducing/getting rid of SPOFs in our environment.
 Firewalls are 2x Watchguard M270 Switches are 2x USW-PRO-24
 I am not a network admin so I am a bit out of my depth, I think I am on the right track but I would like a sanity check
 A crude drawing of my setup here:
 https://i.imgur.com/1ztQUCX.png
 Currently my setup is as above with the exception of the green coloured lines/X, what I want to do is wire up so my switches are fully redundantly connected with the firewalls, as I currently have servers connected to the switches but if SWITCH1 dies we lose internet/VLAN routing.
 So, in short:
  
add new interface to watchguard cluster (so one new port on each FW)
 connect both of those ports to SWITCH2
 delete the current line between SWITCH1 and SWITCH2
  
Would love some input if this looks alright or if I am about to create a loop and what I should do instead.

                              <span>Can anyone tell me why a PTZ camera I purchased boots on my Cisco 3560G-24PS (802.3af) but not on either of my small PoE switches (Netgear GS308P, TP-Link TL-SF1008P) that are rated the same 15.4w as the Cisco and also say 802.3af? The camera spec says 15w max and says PoE 802.3af as well. The camera power lights just come on dimly and fade out every few seconds like it&#x27;s not getting enough power on the small switches but as far as I know, they are rated for the same spec as the Cisco. I run a few security cameras off both small switches so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about the Cisco over the other switches. The only thing I can think of is that the Cisco might be sending power before negotiation completes or the small ones have some issue negotiating and don&#x27;t deliver power long enough for it to complete.

 All they are giving us they are looking into it.

 Any idea how to proceed with escalation?

                              <span>I joined a small start-up about 3 months ago. In the interview, I was promised &quot;a good and friendly team you can rely on&quot;. After joining, everything was going well. I was getting used to work culture, learning their procedures and after a month or two, I had a pretty good handle on things. In fact, I was able to learn/understand a lot of processes/tools without proper training or documentation. According to my manager &quot;I am grasping everything very well&quot; and he was pretty happy with my work here. 
 A month and a half after joining, my manager resigned and my teammate(same level and working 8 months longer than me in the company) became the lead and his attitude changed drastically after becoming my manager. Yesterday he told me I had to inform him if I am off my desk even for 5 minutes 🤯 anyway We are now only 2 people in the team. Him &amp; me. We manage helpdesk and infrastructure. 
 A week ago I asked him if I can start work half an hour early and finish early only on Mondays so that I can take my 11-month-old kid to swimming classes. I thought it was simple request and out of nowhere he told me NO because as a helpdesk/sysadmin team, we are supposed to support 9 to 5. I agreed with him and asked if he can cover for the last 30 minutes and again, the answer was NO. 
 So today I set up a meeting and asked the same thing to the senior manager and he told me &quot;because we had a couple of departures from our team, he can&#x27;t give me that flexibility. And there are no plans to hire anyone anytime soon.&quot; 
 I mean, 2 people already left in last 2 months (my manager and another colleague), are you ready to lose another just for this one small request?(I guess they are lol)
 Anyways I guess it&#x27;s time to start looking for another job. tbh, in my 10 years of career, I never had to choose between my family and my job. I always thought teammates help when needed.
 TL;DR: workplace indirectly asked me to choose between family and job

                              <span>Please help! This is driving me nuts. 
 We have some obscure Windows application which can only be installed with the installer it was installed with. 
 Problem is, our previous sys admin removed all the older packages. 
 The Windows app received about 7 updates and we only have the 3 latest installer versions. So for some people with older versions, the apps could not be removed. 
 Tried using msiexec with GUID and msiexec in combination with the latest installers. Not works. 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated!
 We are using SCCM btw.

 What fun stuff do u guys do to remind users to always lock their workstations if stepping away from their desks?
 We do have a GPO policy to lock after 15 mins of inactivity.

                              <span>Hello, curious how you all would handle this.
 Currently we have some servers that require starting applications up after a restart or verification that the application did not break after windows updates. This also includes taking snapshots.
 Due to that we are updating some servers manually and it takes quite some time to do it after hours. 
 Is this just a grin and bear it solution if the vendor doesn&#x27;t have a way to automate the task?
 The only half solution I can think of is to schedule snapshots and schedule updates and then still do the manual portion before opening hours rather than after. I just wonder if most people work this way or if servers needing touched after restarts are less common.

                              <span>Right now in our environment it is a choatic mess with printers...everyone has their own weird printer, from small epsons, canons, lexmark etc., you name it, on top of our huge Konica Minoltas and Epson C20600 (At least I think it is by epson iirc, I&#x27;d have to look at the notes I took again).
 As these printers die out I want to eventually bring in brother printers since I have heard good things about them, but I&#x27;m not sure how we should have our setup work.
 What I mean is, we spend so much money in various inks and it is a mess, outside of the ones we have auto managed for our surgery center.
 I was thinking that in order to save money, we have specific locations that have their own small printers, and perhaps incorporate large ones for regular workers like our call center and MA&#x27;s area.
 But I also heard that having everyone get up and having to go get their stuff can cause delays with patients etc.
 What do you guys think? There&#x27;s got to be a way to slowly move us in the direction of unity where everyone has the same brand, and also not spend thousands of dollars for all these different inks??
 At a loss on this one and I would love senior opinions from those more experienced than me.
 I appreciate it!

                              <span>So if I have a group of users who should be able to occasionally execute programs as Administrator, but who I do not want to just log in as admin every day, I have thought of making a second account for them. So user &quot;jdoe&quot; would be a regular user, but &quot;jdoe-a&quot; would have Administrator rights.
 The thinking is that you could not log into a machine as &quot;jdoe-a&quot;, but you can log in as &quot;jdoe&quot; and when it prompts for an Administrator password to escalate privileges for something, the user could think first and then enter &quot;jdoe-a&quot; credentials if appropriate.
 Is this advisable? How can I accomplish this with AD Users and Computers and/or Group Policy?
 Thank you

                              <span>We&#x27;re working on refreshing some of our production machines. Computers used for flight operations and demos and such. Each workstation is plugged into 6 monitors.
 We naively thought a single 3080 and some dp to hdmix2 adapters would cover the need.
 Turns out Nvidia GTX/RTX cards are capped at 4 displays.
 Nice new machine is going back in the box and back to Dell.

 This just started happening to me. A job got posted in my area and no less than 20 companies out of India all called me within the first hour of the job posting. Some of them at the same time. I have added my own to the list and made a github page as suggested by u/not_a_lob
 Github: https://github.com/SirKratosAurion/ITJobSpam
 If you come across something not on the list feel free to open an issue and I will review it.
 thanks to u/Elranzer for the original posting
 Edit: It has come to my attention via a report sent to me on github that a lot of the mail comes from the same &quot;mailed-by&quot; or &quot;signed-by&quot; headers. Gmail does not currently allow us to filter by these. If you have a moment please go to gmail and click the ? icon in the upper right corner to send feedback requesting that they allow us to filter email by these fields. https://github.com/SirKratosAurion/ITJobSpam/wiki

 I&#x27;m planning on working today but you know gonna be a bit lazy and slow. 
 I have some documents that do need updated but also get the feeling that saying you are updating docs is really a universal term in IT that means you don&#x27;t really feel like working that day and I&#x27;m sure my manager who&#x27;s been in IT for 25 years is well aware of that so I need a better excuse.

 Has anyone connected a Sophos XGS Firewall with the cellular modem add-on to the Telus cellular network in Canada? If so, what plan were you able to use with Telus? Also, what settings did you have to provide them in order to get the unit connected?
 Typically Telus will want the IMEI of the mobile device getting connected but I&#x27;m not able to find that anywhere in the Sophos XGS interface for the cell WAN connection. 
 Any advice or recommendations would be much appreciated!

                              <span>My dear friends, it&#x27;s roughly that time of year again for interns to descend on our departments asking for things they have no business having or asking things they should already know. I&#x27;m reminded of what may be the most socially oblivious intern I&#x27;ve ever come across. 
 For context, I work for a large nationwide company, and my role is a tier 2/3. I also take on a bit of security work, and a bit of networking. Kind of a jack of all trades - I&#x27;m also the only person in my position in my region of the country. Once a quarter everyone on my team gives updates at an all hands meeting, discussing the common issues that have been appearing in our regions and other metrics and things. These are big important meetings that are attended by every level of IT management up to and including the CIO…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks. Hope you&#x27;re doing well. 
 How you guys manage your Linux devices of WFH workforce?
 We have a whole Development team that works from home and uses Linux devices. Something about 15 devices. And, sadly, we don&#x27;t manage any aspect of this devices. We&#x27;re in the dark with it. 
 With Windows devices, we use Defender for Endpoint + Intune, to manage and protect. But for Linux, we don&#x27;t have anything yet. 
 Have any of you used some solution of WSL or Cloud PC to this use case? Or any other solution?
 How it worked out? What was your solutions to this kind of problem? 
 The whole Dev team is remote, so it&#x27;s hard to keep control of the devices, considering that they don&#x27;t have any technician to help them out. 
 Thanks folks :)

 I wanted to reach out to see if anyone had any experience with a door controller that uses a Badge System for employees that also integrates with Active Directory/Azure Active Directory. We are looking for automatic disablement of badges when the account gets deleted/disabled. 
 We are only able to get budget approval if the solution is a fully cloud Native Solution and requires no On-Prem infra. 
 We are currently facing issues with revoking the badge on employee terminations in a timely manner and this is proving to be a potential security/safety risk for the organization. We Currently use A Bosch system that is not up to snuff and the offerings from them require a USB cloud Dongle that requires a server....

                              <span>Hello, we want to secure the connections to our test environment a bit more, my first idea was using the Azure Application Proxy but it seems like this only works with an on-prem AD (can&#x27;t access the RDGW settings without being domain joined), we are only using Azure AD and have no on-prem infrastructure besides our test environment.
 We would like to have 2FA authentication and in the best case a SSO with our azure credentials, does anyone have a recommendation or idea on how to get the app proxy working without having a on-prem ad?
 On the test environment we have various labs with their own domain for product testing and training.

                              <span>Had an issue I could not figure out the answer to, so I thought it would share it here: 
 I&#x27;m creating a custom Windows 10 image in an Amazon-hosted VDI solution called WorkSpaces. 
 We noticed, after cleaning up the image, we ended up inadvertently removing the Windows 10 Store Photo.App. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t connect back to the Windows Store to just reinstall it, so I was trying to install the Photo.App via a DISM command: 
 dism /online /addappxpackpage /packpagepath: /xxxxxx /skiplicense /dependancypackage: xxxxxx , where xxxxxx is the name of the package. 
 I could not find the specific name of the Windows 10 Photo.App package unfortunately. 
 Anyone else had any luck manually reinstalling the Windows Photo.App?

 Water in a DC can never be good...
  
Description: Water intrusion in europe-west9-a has caused a multi-cluster failure and has led to an emergency shutdown of multiple zones. We expect general unavailability of the europe-west9 region. There is no current ETA for recovery of operations in the europe-west9 region at this time, but it is expected to be an extended outage. Customers are advised to failover to other regions if they are impacted.

                              <span>Straight forward process:
  
You send the group a meeting request
  
 You have to say who you want in the meeting
 You have to have an agenda
 You have to justify WHY you need each person. Saying they report to &quot;so and so&quot; is NOT a reason.
  
When the meeting group gets the request they will vet it and see if your meeting is actually needed. If it isn&#x27;t, then they will state the reason why and alternatives that you can do to get the result you need without having a meeting. EVERYONE is subjected to this - even the CEO
 If you try to go around them and host a meeting without their consent - you get sent to HR and they will handle things. You could lose the right to host a meeting, get written up, get a warning or even you could lose your job over this. This includes getting someone else to host the meeting for you when you have been told you are not allowed to host a meeting.
 After the meeting, ALL the folks who attended will be sent a survey to grade the meeting. This is used by the meeting group to grade the host. If the host keeps getting low scores, they are sent to training on how to host a meeting correctly. If they keep getting low scores after that, they are banned from hosting meetings.
 Meetings are by far the worst money waster in a company. Imagine how much could be done if pointless meetings could be eliminated.

 In this configuration, it will not activate as it is no longer on OEM hardware. Is it possible to buy a new license to and activate the ROK image in a VM with a new key? I also have two Server 2012 R2 VMs, currently running on the exiting 2012 installation. They are again on the ROK license.
 So far the only response I&#x27;ve got from UK resellers is that this is not possible. Are they right?
 Any help would be appreciated.
 Thanks!

 I have RDS server with Windows Server 2016. Is there a way to deactivate the &quot;Updates are available&quot; popup, so that users don&#x27;t see it?
 Things I have already tried:
  
Set the GPO &quot;Allow non-administrators to receive update notifications&quot; beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to disabled (not supported for Windows 10 and so I assume also Server 2016)
 Set the GPO &quot;Remove access to use all Windows Update features&quot; beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to enabled (valid for Server 2016)
 The same GPO beneath User Configuration set to Enabled and &quot;Configure notifications:&quot; set to &quot;0 - Do not show any notifications&quot; (not supported on Windows 10)
  
Is disabling automatic updates the only solution to this problem? (not tested yet)
 How did you implement this? Any idea is appreciated.

                              <span>I need to set it so SharePoint sites can&#x27;t be shared externally by members only the owners. I can do it with this setting but can&#x27;t find it under SharePoint sharing in the admin centre so it looks like it has to be done per site? Is this right?
 Is there a better way to do it? I don&#x27;t want to restrict sharing completely as we do need to add guests but only want the site owners to do it.

                              <span>Hi folks, need some help solving a stupid but necessary problem at work.
 Our auditors require us to capture evidence of the configuration of our Linux and Unix servers. That could mean capturing the contents of a config file or the output of a command like netstat. Capturing the outputs into a text file would be trivial and easy to script but the auditors are absolutely convinced that these files would be too easy to fake and demand that we capture screenshots instead (yes, I am well aware that screenshots would also be trivial to fake but the only other option is literally have the auditors sit next to us while we page through lines of output and no, I&#x27;m not kidding).
 For context, we are using Windows laptops to connect to various Linux and Unix servers.
 The perfect solution would be a…</span>

 Although the product works for our use case, the level of end user involvement to set up a meeting is a huge deterrent and users have flat out avoided it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Hoping to get some help with my current policy configuration.
 Basically, MFA is enforced (enrolment required and security info registration locked-down to trusted network) but I can&#x27;t seem to get SIF working on Wi-Fi and I&#x27;m prompted immediately when disconnecting from ethernet.
 SIF is the only session control enabled on the &quot;MFA Enforced&quot; policy but not sure why I&#x27;m still being prompted after disconnecting from LAN (trusted location). SIF is set to 60 days and I can sign-in again (going through the standard MFA process, also not seeing the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask again&quot; option which is a good sign) but I&#x27;ll get prompted for MFA again if I join and then leave the LAN same day.
 Wi-Fi public IP is shared with other tenancies in the building so I won&#x27;t add that to trusted locations but I&#x27;d still like SIF to apply regardless of location.
 Been scouring forums but can&#x27;t find cases where they&#x27;re configuring for trusted locations.
 TL;DR - No MFA prompt when on trusted network, MFA prompt immediately when not on trusted network even though SIF is set to 60 days.
 TIA

                              <span>Hi guys
 Hope someone can help us out as we have made a terrible mistake in our team.
 We have a task for every 3 months to reset the krbtgt password twice inside our domain. Normally we would do this like recommended to wait for 24h before doing the second reset and then go our ways until the 3 months mark has been reached. Never had a problem for years. Now today it happened. I reset the password yesterday in the evening and scheduled the second reset for tomorrow as there normally would be no harm to do that even a day afterwards as long as we wait said 24. well what happened. The second admin new to our environment started the second reset this morning thinking that I did not do the first reset today in the morning and now we cannot access our DCs, nor any other server which only allows admin access to them. 
 I saw that one would need to restart every server and afterwards all clients which connect to the domain. Is this true? Or should we already plan for the a recovery plan? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a user whos Outlook crashes when printing email. Only some emails, and the example I was shown this morning is fairly long chain with some screenshots in it. She got her collegue to print it and it worked fine. But her&#x27;s, once the print window appears, that&#x27;s it, print preview is blank, it says connecting to printer but it&#x27;s frozen.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Changing default printer
 Saving attachment to desktop and opening and printing from there
 Outlook in safe mode
 Enabling IE mode in Edge
 Making sure .mht is associated with Edge
 Online Office repair
 Made sure Outlook trust settings aren&#x27;t set to automatically download
 Removing the outlprnt file
  
None of the above made anyu difference. 
 I did try it from OWA, when I opened the email, hit print, it came straight up fine. Then I noticed it was blocking some content, so I allowed that, hit print, it took about 30sec for the print window to load but it did then work fine. 
 I&#x27;m thinking broken link or something like that, but I&#x27;m not sure what else to try?

                              <span>How do you go about preparing systems, if they involve accounts that use an Authenticator app?
 We often set up new systems with all fine details and settings on our own, which are then shipped to the end user so that they can get right back to work with their new system.
 In the past the users gave us their current passwords once and changed it after the work was done. 
 Now Microsoft 365 requires a 2FA on the basis of an authentication app (Microsoft or third-party), which means that we have to go to the user every time we need to sign in, so that they can give us the necessary PINs. 
 Since Microsoft 365 requires a new login quite frequently during setup, it can then happen that we have to keep pestering the users over 1-3 days, our work gets held up if we can&#x27;t reach them, etc.
 Have you found a solution and a reasonable workflow for this?

                              <span>We are way too late, I know. It&#x27;s not up to me.
 There are still two 2008R2 in use, which I want to migrate to 2022 with the Storage Migration Service.
 This does not work because the Powershell version is too low. So I have to install the Windows Management Framework first. As soon as I install the update and then restart the server, the update fails and is undone. In the event logs I get the error code 80070661 and I can&#x27;t find a solution on the net.
 Could it be because we don&#x27;t have Extended Security Updates for 2008R2 servers? 
 Do you have any other idea how I can solve this problem?

                              <span>We have a client that we have to turn on/off email forwarding for specific users, when they are on vacation etc.
 On Exchange online you can just turn it on and off manually. Idea is that i want to make it less of a chore and automate this. For example turn on forwarding emails from user1 to user2 from datetime1 to datetime2.
 Idea is to use scheduler on server and run two scripts. One for turning on and one for turning off. Maybe some kind of gui that create two scripts base on use input and after the second script run, both tasks are deleted?
 Any idea how to proceed with this?

                              <span>I have at home ssh server (no-ip, internal nat, ssh key). I can connect to it via phone and laptop from anywhere. But only when I am on company VPN or on office network, I get &quot;No gssapi security context available&quot; as last event in putty. I see IP and SSH info in event log, so I can connect, just it stops by gssapi. Similar on connectbot from phone when on company wifi network.
 Do you have some recommendation how to mitigate this? Probably some company policy with putty or ssh. I have at home 3D printer and would not like to observe it via phone&#x27;s data and similar for home events.

 Long time ago i used whatsup gold for that, i tried to start with visio but there has to be something more useful. Would be nice to be able to select a system and gets highlighted or even in some table all its relations.

 I&#x27;de welcome some system that works like a wiki so other contributors can add stuff/modify easily and it should also be able to import stuff from excel / google sheets easily and then be editable.
 opensource is fine, also payed but it needs to be some kind of trial so i can test it and show it off to the rest of the staff.
 What say yee? Suggestions are welcome :)

                              <span>I posted this question 5 years ago. Looking to see how answers have changed.
 IPv6 was published as a standard in December 1998. With the 30th anniversary approaching, what has shaken out to be the most accepted way of assigning Addresses in an enterprise environment? 
  
SLAAC + RDNSS
 SLAAC with DHCPv6 for for Domain info
 DHCPv6 with SLAAC only for RA
  
(Yes, I know that Android is still not on the DHCPv6 train, but Windows is on the RDNSS train now, so major changes have happened in the last 5 years.)
 I know the NSA has published a document this January with the following:
 &quot;NSA recommends assigning addresses to hosts via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) server to mitigate the SLAAC privacy issue. Alternatively, this issue can also be mitigated by using a randomly generated interface ID (RFC 4941 – Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Auto-configuration in IPv6) [1] that changes over time, making it difficult to correlate activity while still allowing network defenders requisite visibility &quot; 
 So how are you guys handling address assignment?

I&#x27;ve skimmed the RFCs, and I haven&#x27;t found anything one way or another on whether this is permissible or forbidden (rfc3046 says a relay agent does not add a second relay agent option, but nothing about a second bridge). My expectation is that this should never happen, but at least JTAC seems to think this is fine, despite inconsistent behavior as a result of this. Has anyone else encountered anything like this?

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;m trying to develop a proof of concept for something and it begins with using a virtual Sonicwall Nv270 hosted in azure, and creating an IPSec VPN tunnel interface between the NSv and a remote site.
 I created this VM in line with the Sonicwall best practice which includes using the Marketplace template to stand it up.
 The remote site in question is a Cradlepoint IBR900 Cellular router. We&#x27;ve used a lot of these devices in other deployments - Including - Scenarios where we&#x27;ve deployed physical Sonicwalls in customer data centers and had IPsec tunnels to between them.
 The Azure VM is running Linux CentOS and it has a Public IP which is then bound to the virtual network WAN interface X1 which also has a private IP. 
 The Sonicwall isn&#x27;t aware if it&#x27;s Public IP - The WAN Interface X1 has an IP of 10.1.0.4 and sends traffic out the internet to its DFGW of 10.1.0.1 - I cannot change the WAN Interface IP nor the DFGW which I find really odd. 
 I have by default an NSG inside Azure which I&#x27;ve setup to allow traffic sourced from the Cradlepoint&#x27;s public IP on ports 50, 51, 500 and 4500.
 I have created on both the sonicwall and the cradlepoint, a VTI and triple checked all of the configuration for Phase 1 and Phase 2 to ensure it matches.
 On the Sonicwall, I can see traffic coming from the CP on it&#x27;s public IP on the allowed ports and the reverse leaving the firewall.
 I do not have an Azure VPN Gateway set up - I wanted to set this up without it if it&#x27;s possible due to some limitations with it.
 I&#x27;m quite green with Azure so I&#x27;m trying my best to get something basic working but having difficulties. If you need further information, please let me know.

Can someone please explain why do we need NSX if ACI provides both underlay and overlay networks. I understand that NSX has distributed FW and other features but what else does it solve when you already have ACI that provides L2 extension. Why do we need double overlays?

                              <span>We (a mid-sized ISP) have moved to Nokia 7750 as an edge router. Everything is working great, but until we get our second edge set up, we need to have 2 Google BGP peers on the one router. If I turn them both on, I get asynchronous routing and it causes all kinds of problems. How can I have one set up as a secondary, that only takes accepts prefixes if the main peer goes down? I didn&#x27;t see any kind of option like in the Nokia CLI. I&#x27;m used to Ericsson routers, and they have a multiple-peers with same AS option. TIA!

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;ve noticed that large public Wi-Fi networks tend to have an IP configuration similar to this:
 Network: aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/30 (I&#x27;ve seen segments from 28 to 30)
 Gateway: aaa.bbb.ccc.1 (default gateway is in any IP from segment 23)
 I just wanted to ask if anyone of you have deployed large campus wi-fi networks and know why this is the case. I have some theories of my own:
  
Helps with client isolation.
 Helps with bandwidth management, where you assign certain bandwidth capacity to each subnet.
 ??? (I just don&#x27;t know what else could be the cause of this).

                              <span>Haven&#x27;t touched Comware7 switches much, but the few times I did I would struggle to get Radius working for authentication via NPS. There&#x27;s a few articles out there but somehow I still always had issues like NPS sending Access-Accept, switch logs showing successful login, but it would immediately disconnect me.
 This time I decided to document what I learned so that others might benefit.. i.e me in a few years when I forget again :)
 Switch config:
 ssh server enable radius scheme NPS primary authentication 1.2.3.4 primary accounting 1.2.3.4 key authentication simple MY-PSK-HERE key accounting simple MY-PSK-HERE user-name-format without-domain domain MYDOMAIN authentication login radius-scheme NPS local authorization login radius-scheme NPS local accounting login radius-scheme NPS local domain default enable MYDOMAIN line vty 0 63 authentication-mode scheme user-role network-admin user-role network-operator protocol inbound ssh idle-timeout 600 0 
 NPS
 --Network Policies ----Constraints ------Authentication Methods Uncheck all except for PAP. PAP required. ----Settings ------Vendor Specific Add an attribute &quot;Cisco-AV-Pair&quot; Add attribute value and enter &quot; shell:roles&#x3D;network-admin &quot; 
 Obviously this is not a complete guide. This assumes you know how to set up NPS/radius generally. This is just the hang ups.

 ​
 Problem is I never worked with Catalysts before, and only OS upgrade I&#x27;ve done (1-2 year ago) were on Nexus. I dont really work on anything else apart from ACI nowadays :C
 ​
 Can someone get me through the commands?I guess I&#x27;ll have to transfer the new image file to the switch via tftp, and thats it. I don&#x27;t know anything about boot load orders, confregs, or any of that.
 ​
 Plz help!

 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi,
 thinking about source address persistence in BigIP, but couln&#x27;t find any limits/recomendation.
 The question is, if the timeout in source address persistence profile is set relatively high (for example 8 hours ) how crticial can this become regarding to memory of the BigIP.
 If there are for example 1M entries (for 1M different source IPs) in the persistent table, does this effect perfomance ?
 Already tried &#x27;tmsh show sys memory | grep -i &quot;subsystem\|persist&quot;&#x27; but thats not realy helpful.

                              <span>As my title states. When you have a HA Firewall set to Active-Passive, the passive firewall only comes online in the event of a failure of some sort, even if the active firewall is running at full capacity. Meaning one should configure for Active-Active if you want to achieve load balancing capabilities and reduce latency during high levels of utilization, is my understanding correct?

                              <span>Can I use the Sophos XGS 87 for 35-40 users (actual users might be around 30 only but I am increasing the number futurewise) all the users are basically light internet users (2 users heavily focused on downloading backups from servers which needs bandwith) I have a fiber line of 100Mbps.
 My question was basically that does the firewall software limit users to 20 or is it unlimited but the company advertises it as 20 for declared performance? ( even if performance drops with more users it would not affect my 100Mbps right??)

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am having bandwidth issues and after many tests I am now clueless so I&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ll come up with fresh ideas...
 So here&#x27;s the main issue : using the VPN from home, we have a download speed of 1.5MB/s which is low given the VPN concentrator and infrastructure we have (from the office using the VPN, the download speed is ~30MB/s).
 But this low speed is mainly due to the link/path speed which is low even without using a VPN (8Mo/s). But I can&#x27;t understand why I can only reach 8Mo/s on this link (downloading a file from home to the office WITHOUT VPN).
 What I can&#x27;t explain is that the upload speed from the office to a Cloud Server (mega.nz or weTransfer) uses almost the same path but the upload speed is much better ~20+MB/s (and speedtest.net shows ~500Mbps).
 Here&#x27;s a recap of all the tests I have done so far (no VPN). Know that the speed tests were done with 2 different devices to be sure it&#x27;s not device related (2 file servers, 2 home office computers in different locations, etc..).
 My only guess so far is that it could be due to MTU / packet fragmentation but I don&#x27;t see where would this fragmentation happen. Could they have different policies depending on the flow type (TCP established)? That would explain why Office -&gt; Internet upload speed and Internet -&gt; Office download speed (&#x3D; same flow source / direction) are different but I don&#x27;t see why they would do that?
 Thanks in advance and have a great day!

                              <span>Hi All.
 We&#x27;ve got a BGP with our Plubic AS peering with two Tier 1 providers. (Telia and Cogent)
 The issue I&#x27;m having is that customers using Zayo here in the US are getting latency over 40ms. We&#x27;re based in NYC and our traffic is routed to Atlanta via Zayo, if I use the Zayo looking glass to find our IP, I can confirm it&#x27;s going to Atlanta. Neither of my ISPs can do anything about it.
 I tried reporting Zayo, but no luck. When I ping my office using Altice, the time is fine, but if I ping a Zayo customer or vice versa, it&#x27;s not. Both providers give me the default route.
 Do you guys have any ideas on what to do?

                              <span>Okay im trying to downgrade the firmware on my 7841 cisco ip phones. All I have to work with is a laptop and single router, a pacstar 447 and no Internet. I copied the firmware from a USB to the routers flash, I then configured dhcp. Cme and sip, a voice vlan and interfaces. I configured the port the phone is connecting to as a trunk because it wasn&#x27;t letting me ping the phone unless I did so. When I look in the phones settings it shows it has an ip given from the dhcp I set up, it shows the tftp server ip that I set on the router and it shows the routers domain name and hostname, and the routers ip, it shows that there is no codec on the phone and in the status when I reboot or factory reset the phone it shows dns no ip, so I tried configuring that but it still doesn&#x27;t show up. And when I do the upgrade command or create profile command is says error deleted flash:/ then some weird file name that doesn&#x27;t exist on the router. My supervisor said not to worry about it. Any ideas of what I could be missing? Also before I made it a trunk port the phone would say tftp timed out but now it has the dns thing which confuses me because we&#x27;re not trying to pull anything from a dns and we have all it needs on the router.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been a Barracuda Backup shop for years now. Regulations require holding onto stuff for a long time, and as I inherited it, and it was working, I left it alone. I started down the Veeam Backup path about 3 years ago as a more rich feature set, as well as a secondary backup system. Just got my Barracuda renewal quote and its a 200% rate increase. Its seriously making me consider that its time to throw in the towel and walk away. Anyone have experience trying to get legacy info out of Barracudas and imported into Veeam? Only idea I have at the minute is to restore the yearlies as a VM, then have Veeam back that up. Just take a point in time from every year. Thanks in advance.

 Going to this site shows a cert issue and you&#x27;re quickly re-directed. Seems like an MS Issue, but I can&#x27;t confirm obviously.

 How on earth do you find the time to keep it meaningful? You&#x27;d have to come awful close to an exact clone of production and keep it separate yet synchronized. That strikes me as being a full time job for not just one guy but a team of guys.
 I&#x27;d love to hear what you folks are doing.

                              <span>I apologize that this isn&#x27;t necessarily the right sub but wondering if anyone in here can recommend me a quiet mouse.
 Short story is we have what I like to call a rage clicker - the user is fine but he punishes his mouse to the point people sitting near him complain - more than once lol. I&#x27;m after something that is reasonably quiet compared to your bog standard HP mouse that can also withstand button smashing...
 There are a few on the market but I need to know whatever we get will hold up :/
 Edit for context: in Australia (g&#x27;day cobbers)

                              <span>Hi all.
 I’ve been tasked with the seemingly impossible job of trying to figure out how to make the Unitrends backup system meet the needs of our company. 
 In the 3 years we’ve been with Unitrends our situation has gone from bad to worse to where I’m spending majority of my day chasing backups and monitoring ‘round the clock because I can’t take my eyes off the system least I want to spend the next day or two rebooting appliances, stopping/starting tasker, re-syncing assets, etc.
 It’s like pulling teeth trying to get my tickets escalated. They’re putting most of their KB’s behind a pay wall! 
 I’m at my wits end trying to make lemonade out of this lemon. I’m working on picking up bash scripting, but are there any tips, tricks, custom hacks or resources that anyone can recommend for a multi- UB virtual appliance system? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Background:
 So for some brief background I&#x27;m a Jr SysAdmin who has been working for a contractor for a little over half a year now. We manage the entire infrastructure for our client who has a little over a handful of buildings across multiple sites totaling a few hundred rotating users plus about 1500 devices. We use sys asmin very loosely so I was actually originally intended to do help desk.
 Somehow I&#x27;ve somehow found my way to working with firewalls, certs, GPOs, Endpoint-Management, Patching, as well as managing our ePO.
  
The situation:
 Now when I say working on the firewall, I mean teaching our new network engineer how our firewall works as he had never interacted with it (our former left). I don&#x27;t have the permissions to touch it myself, however I was asked to start managing our certs (some internal, and externals) which would have come with said permissions. I was also set up to manage a site by myself, this being on top of my usual tasks I have been working on.
 Keep in mind I am the only &quot;jr.&quot; and make the least money in our team of almost 20 despite me being one of the only 5-ish admins who work at the enterprise level. So with this, I decided to decide to come back and tell them I would be happy to do these things under the condition that they actually pay me more (I make 60, asked for 75).
 This request was then greeted with a sudden lack of interest as well as an email to colleagues behind my back to find out everything I am involved in and/or have been handed. Additionally asking them to stop laying as much work on me.
  
The question:
 I have not received any response in an official capacity yet, but I have a bad feeling. Do you guys think it&#x27;s time to start applying, or do you think it may go well?
 Thank you guys :)

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 Currently going through an M365 migration (E3). I have a number of third party applications that I like (Sentinelone, Splunk, Okta etc.), but there is a number of comparable applications that seem to integrate nicely together. 
 Generally speaking, I&#x27;m against putting all my eggs in one basket but I was curious if anyone has pulled the trigger and moved to 100% (or close to) 365/Azure/Sentinel setup and what your experience has been.
 Thanks!

 Trying to compensate for other organization&#x27;s poor email configurations without traditional whitelists is insanely difficult, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible. (Hey Amazon SES!

 After 24 h Update: The situation has escalated since my last post. One of my managers DMed me and asked me not to do the task that I messed up yesterday until we are together, we had this conversation:
  
Manager: *Hi [my name]. (he never did that)* 
 Me: Hi. 
 Manager: Are you doing well? (He never did that before and I thought I was about to get fired, so his sudden niceness was surprising.&quot; ) 
 Me: Yes, I&#x27;m doing well. 
 Manager: Please don&#x27;t do the task (that I messed up yesterday) until we are together. 
 Me: Okay, I&#x27;ll wait for you. (Big thank god on my face)
  
I ended up doing the task anyway and he handled the communication of the task with the client, they are taking extra precautions to avoid any further damage.

 Unfortunately, they were never told to rename it.
 Who else has stumbled the hard way on Microsoft&#x27;s limit of 256 characters in a file name? Are there any tools for those files these days other than robocopy-ing them to a shorter path?

 Radio silence for over 2 hours.
 &quot;I&#x27;m just finishing up the list, I should have it over to you any minute now.&quot;
 Around 4pm I get on another call with a co-worker talking about some weirdness with my Azure portal login. We&#x27;re on the phone until nearly 5pm, and by this time I completely forgot about the deployment, because I never saw anything come over. So I log off for the day.
 I&#x27;m on PTO today, and I get pinged about that deployment from my manager, on behalf of the guy who requested the deployment. Apparently they sent me the info after 4:30pm, and my bosses response after I told him that was &quot;4:30 is still within core hours&quot;.

 I’ve thoughtfully applied for over 100 jobs in the last few weeks, asking within their own posted salary ranges and never at the high end. I’ve provided cover letters, did research on the companies, the works.
 I want to work, and no matter what effort I put, no matter how I tune my Resume, I have not landed even a single interview. I’ve done everything short of getting on my knees for it, but nobody is hiring. I’m this close to just quitting the industry and joining a trade.
 How the hell are you folks surviving in this market, if you don’t already have a job?!

                              <span>In the Windows LAPS announcement Microsoft made two weeks ago, they mentioned that the Azure AD scenario wasn&#x27;t ready yet and would be coming later in Q2. Well, it looks like it came faster than many of us were expecting. I&#x27;m not sure how I missed this until today, but there&#x27;s an update from Microsoft announcing the availability to manage Windows LAPS via Intune and store passwords in Azure AD (posted 4/21):

 Sure it’s totally cool and I understand that means you should talk louder until I stop to give you attention.
 No please do not ask me colleagues that are 3 ft away and not in a meeting.

                              <span>Throwaway here. So, Security professional for a medium sized org (4k+ employees). Got a hit on a suspicious email over the weekend and since I&#x27;m on call I decided to take a look. What that email contained was a Powerpoint presentation and a large Excel file with several macros from an outside consulting company that we have hired. Basically, it details a large push to outsource almost all of our business processes by 2026. This includes all of IT. The plan is that we will cut down to less than 1200 employees.
 So, couple of questions. Those have went through an outsourcing before, is it customary for the employees being laid off to be asked to help in the transition? Only scenario I can see that being appealing if I was only a few years from retirement. Is there any other incentive for me to stick around?
 Besides updating my resume, anything else I should do?

                              <span>Good morning!
 I was hoping some of you fine folks have some ideas/recommendations for a tool that would monitor software that is used within our environment that can track updates that are needed.
 Sorry, bit of a word salad there. Basically, as I&#x27;m sure a lot of you can relate to, we have software that will be two or three versions out of date but aren&#x27;t aware of it due to the time that would be needed to check each and every piece of software individually. I&#x27;m not even sure if something like this exists, honestly.
 Any help/input would be greatly appreciated.
 Have a good day!

                              <span>We’ve been using Joan conference room displays for 5 years with an on-prem Joan server. Visionect had previously offered the on premise hosting without any licensing fees. 
 Today I come to work and see that all the displays have a “This device does not have an active subscription license…” message. Going out to the website, I’m not seeing any reference to the free offering any more. 
 I went through my emails to see if I had been given any heads up that the licensing was going to change, but I’m not seeing anything. Has anyone else been caught off guard with this, or was there plenty of warning and my spam filters possibly prevented me from knowing this was coming?

Its not your company. you just work for them. do the workload you can do to the best of your abilities, and then go home when its time. stop taking those stupid meetings and stop staying late. when people push things onto you, put them at the end of the queue and go about your day. if you cant feasibly do a project in 10 days when you know its gonna take a month, say so. dont just roll over and take it. stand up for yourselves. you wont get that promotion for doing more work, and you wont lose your job for doing less work. shits on fire? cool. not your company. you are just there for a paycheck. nothing more.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have two iR-ADV C5740 copiers.
 Recently they were moved to a new building, and now they are having issues with what seems like waking up from a deep sleep. When prints are sent, it&#x27;s taking a few minutes for it to wake up and print. No settings were changed. It&#x27;s on a 2 hour sleep timer, which is the longest you can set, and within that time frame it will go back into this deep sleep. It&#x27;s definitely losing network connection during this sleep, which is why prints are getting stuck in a queue till a point in which it wakes back up. I&#x27;ve found this out when attempting to ping it when reports come in that prints aren&#x27;t going through.
 Has anyone ran into something like this? I&#x27;m leaning more towards an issue with the network or switch than a sleep or energy saving setting, because like I said, nothing was changed.

                              <span>Years ago, when I handled my first tickets it was baffling to me why people would not want their tickets resolved. 
 I came to the conclusion that there are two types of people that open tickets, people that want their issue resolved, people that want their issue documented and possibly resolved in the future. The second type of effectively uses tickets as a technology to do list. .
 Now, years later, in every job, for every team, every time I go through aging tickets, I identify that trend early on. Sometimes it&#x27;s impossible to stop people from using the ticket queue as their personal to-do list but awareness is the first step to mitigating this issue.

                              <span>That price is based on the Microsoft 365 Business Premium (Nonprofit Staff Pricing) license. Canadian dollars.. It&#x27;s the cheapest one I could find that would qualify us.
 It would cost us $25K/year.....to control updates....for their own product. Am I missing something here? Is this not insane to anyone else? I hate WSUS as much as the next guy but damn.

But they marked the meeting URGENT and the meeting organizer sends you a dozens Teams messages because you haven&#x27;t joined the call yet.

                              <span>Hello everyone, i would like some assistance to resolve the problem.
 I have one Jabra Pro 925 Mono headset, did not get it with a dongle when it was ordered.
 The issue is, one of my friends accidently stopped the firmware update on the headset, it was supposed to update to 1.8.2
 Now my headset is constantly glowing with purple color and is stuck updating,(firmvare version 0.0.1) in the aplication Jabra Direct i have the option to recover but there is the catch... So whenever i press the button it goes in starting update mode and goes for hours and never finishes.
 I saw in an old post that there should be a folder in the application:
 C:\Program Files (x86)\Jabra\SDKFirmwareUpdater
 But i do not have this file type (SDKFirmwareUpdater)
 I am using the latest Jabra direct.
 Please help and thank you, for all additional info i will provide

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I was configuring a new user on Windows 11 and trying to remove onedrive libraries for the Documents folder and also set it to a custom folder. Unfortunately I answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the prompt that gave the following warning
 &quot;Do you want to redirection folder &#x27;Documents&#x27; into another system folder &#x27;Profile&#x27; located at C:\Users\username&quot;? If you proceed with the redirection you will not be able to separate them or restore default location.&quot;
 I&#x27;ve since corrected some registry settings and actually do have the Documents library folder where I want it, however in explorer whenever I view the &quot;C:\Users&quot; folder, instead of showing &quot;username&quot; for the user profile it is showing &quot;Documents&quot; in place of their name. (If you click on the path in the path bar it actually shows the correct username, but whenever it shows folder names anywhere it reverts to showing &quot;Documents&quot;).
 I can&#x27;t seem to find what might be causing this or where it would be set. Is it possible to correct this?
 Everything seems to be working fine, it&#x27;s just showing &quot;Documents&quot; in place of &quot;username&quot; in the C:\Users folder which is bothering me.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Come across a weird issue this morning where shortcuts in a network drive location pointing to a different folder on the same server but a different share fail to work when a user is trying to &quot;Save As&quot; 
 Shortcut target is the local path name and works fine when using explorer but fails within the &quot;Save As&quot; dialogue of any program (Office, Notepad, ETC)
 Obviously I can work around this by updating the shortcuts to the hostname/share path but found it weird that it works fine within Explorer. There is also a lot of shortcuts to locations due to the way the business has created its workflow.
 Last update to workstations was 17/04 and we believe its been fine since the update. 
 Im sure this used to work with no issues and there&#x27;s been no major changes as far as I know. Couldn&#x27;t be a DNS thing could it? Looking at it I find it weird that it even works in the first place and is still working in explorer considering the target path is D:\ rather than \\hostname

                              <span>For those who have worked in more sizable environments using centralized DHCP... How has this worked out for you? How many scopes were &quot;manageable&quot; on you DHCP servers? We are looking at a design that will require about 650 additional scopes to be added to our DHCP servers. Does this sound rediculous? It sounds a bit much to me (not that we would have so many subnets nationwide... just that we would have that all on a central DHCP server)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Admins, I would like to ask regarding Windows Malicious Software removal tool. My server has a McAfee Antivirus, recently there is MRT vulnerability detected on my server, and it is showing that the version is not updated, which I need to upgrade the version in order to remediate the vulnerability. Is it okay to have Windows Malicious Software removal tool running on my server even though I have McAfee Antivirus? Or is it better to disable (if possible) the malicious removal tool? Additionally will it affect my applications running on the server? Your replies are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a situation where I&#x27;m working for an IT broker, mainly just doing some really basic testing on second hand components. Even though it involves servers and other enterprise equipment, I don&#x27;t really know anything about setting them up. I&#x27;m slowly getting further and further into debt because it doesn&#x27;t pay well, and I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;ll ever progress past the point I&#x27;m at now because this is literally all the company does. I&#x27;m at a total dead end. It&#x27;s really impacting me mentally and I&#x27;m legitimately getting worried that one day I&#x27;ll just decide to give up on everything.
 I&#x27;ve tried applying to a couple of IT support and SysAdmin jobs locally but it&#x27;s clear that I don&#x27;t have the skills they&#x27;re looking for. I have no skills in anything else either, no degree or anything like that. All I can really do is self-teach if I ever get the motivation to do so. But it seems that everything I look at seems to be giving me different answers. I just want to know, from some people in the industry, what sorts of things should I be looking at when gaining the skills for a SysAdmin job? What software, languages etc should I be learning to use? Any way to learn them for free or as cheap as possible? I can&#x27;t afford any kind of certification like CCNA or CompTIA, so is it worth making a portfolio? How would I do that?
 Basically just any advice would be much appreciated. I&#x27;m so lost and overwhelmed right now.

My company is making sure to show me a wide range of areas in IT and provide me with valuable skills. My apprenticeship is 4 years and I&#x27;m currently ending the second year.
 My question is: Could I convince companies that my knowledge and experience is more superior than someone from the US with a college degree?

                              <span>Oh man I hate S Mode. 
 So I installed Windows 10 on a new laptop. Despite me not wanting S mode, it&#x27;s on automatically. Fine I&#x27;ll just remove it.
 But wait, the WLAN drivers are missing, so I can&#x27;t get onto the internet to disable it in the store. Fine I&#x27;ll just install the drivers.
 Oh no, you can&#x27;t run .exe files in S Mode... So I need to get online to disable S mode but I can&#x27;t get online with S mode active... Fine I&#x27;ll just disable S mode in regedit.
 Oh no, not even regedit will load in S Mode. So now I&#x27;m stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
 Trying regedit in recovery mode shows me the SkuPolicyRequired value as already set to 0 so that&#x27;s no help either.
 a) any ideas?
 b) why is S mode a thing?!

 We&#x27;re currently installing a few hundred Verkada cameras but needing a Windows 3rd party IP camera viewer solution since they now support RSTP streaming. Mainly to have lower latency surveillance but also to ease up access rights management via Verkada command.
 Has anyone got any recommendations for a fit for production solution that has manageability, allows profiles / configs and can span across multiple screens? A lot of the stuff I&#x27;ve found so far has been suitable for homelab and small integrations but not on a bigger scale.
 Thanks all

 They are also reporting 500 errors when accessing Outlook online with the &quot;more information&quot; giving a Microsoft Exchange Data Storage MailboxCrossSiteFailoverException error
 It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a network issue as other users on the same sites are connecting fine, and as far as I know the mobile apps are working fine.
 MS service status isn&#x27;t showing anything either 
 Anyone else seeing this or are we just that bit more special?
 EDIT: MS service health page is showing impact to Outlook desktop and Web clients as part of their fix to a search issue from yesterday. Looks like this is our problem

                              <span>Hi All,
 I need to run a specific script during the Task sequence. But i want this script to run as the very last step. The Task sequence needs to be &quot;completed&quot; and logged in as the local admin. After the first logon, i want to script to run.
 Where should i place the Powershell script in my Task sequence? I&#x27;ve now added it to custom tasks, but it&#x27;s not working.

                              <span>Hey all, long time lurker, occasional poster here. This is a message to any lurkers who think just cause your young doesn’t mean you can’t seize the opportunity.
 As I’ve just landed a placement working as a junior cybersecurity analyst as apart of my college course. Admittedly, I have past experience in the field (home projects/CTFs).
 Please, if your thinking of a career in IT, go for it. Someone out there will take you, I’ve had to contact every company in my local city and towns around it and got this one and others are now offering. If you don’t take initiative, how can you know what you can do?
 For those wondering, I’m mainly going to be shadowing and assisting with governance, vulnerability scanning and occasional SOC work.
 My next steps, learn. Learn. Learn. Having no certifications means I have a lot to learn ;).

 We are a company with 10 users who access remotely to our customers servers (one or two per customer).
 Currently, we use Teamviewer because all of our customers use it for host remote because it&#x27;s free.
 However, our corporate license will cost 330$/month. It&#x27;s too expensive...
 Do you know an alternative of remote app for our team ?
 We want each user can connect on a server simultanously without limit and install a free host for our customer.

 I imagine that together with my colleagues we would do something like &quot;books&quot;, something like wiki pages.
 What do you suggest or already use?

                              <span>Hello all, I am trying to setup a Windows 10 Multi App Kiosk with some camera software (Hikvision iVMS-4200 Desktop client) which requires admin privileges. Please note this a staff facing kiosk not a public facing kiosk.
 Following this tutorial (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps). I have managed to set up my Kiosk on a Standard Windows Account. With a seperate Admin Account to manage the PC. In the kiosk when I click on the application it triggers the &quot;User Account Control&quot; (UAC) pop up asking for the admin password. 
 I have tried the following to bypass this:
  
Changing UAC settings in Control Panel to have not notify. This works for the standard account when not in Kiosk Mode. But when I apply the kiosk provisioning package it seems to turn UAC back on. 
 Changing the compatibility settings to &quot;Run as Admin&quot; for the exe.
 Following (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_compatibility_view.html) from Reddit Question (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/khda06/windows_10_kiosk_mode_running_an_app_with/) I have tried to change this to &quot;Run as Invoker&quot;. 
 Changing the permissions of the folder in which the exe lives in to give standard accounts full permission over that folder.
  
All of these &quot;fixes&quot; work when the kiosk account normally but stops working when I apply the kiosk mode.
 This would make sense as the single app kiosk docs say that UAC need to be enabled for it to work (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/kiosk-single-app). I presume this is the same for multi app kiosk mode.
 Essentially is there any way that I can get an application requiring admin privileges running inside a kiosk without
 Or is there another work around. Something like are we able to create an admin account that could use its password to pass the UAC but does not have a &quot;Desktop Login&quot;. Then I can just share that password. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Long story short, I want to run one of my carts solely off of a battery system we use on set that has 26v and 48v outputs. My switches that I use in my network have 53.5v inputs. Wondering if anyone has a recommendation for boosting the voltage, there are plenty of boosters available online that you can DIY but in my experience any boost or buck I’ve bought can rarely handle any sort of load and I’m not looking at a lot of draw but don’t want to be caught with my pants down if I have to pull some POE+ to the max. Thanks to anyone with insight, I’ll be checking a few other electronics based subreddits as well

                              <span>Greetings everyone,
 A bit stumped on this one, as I&#x27;ve never seen this before. During this TCP handshake between a client and server, I noticed the client sends a [FIN, ACK] on step 3. Any ideas what could be happening here? Has anyone else encountered this?
 For context, I&#x27;m basically trying to send Netflow from a load balancer to a NetFlow collector. The firewall is not blocking this connection, but shows the app as &#x27;incomplete&#x27;.
 Here&#x27;s what I found:
 client: syn server: syn, ack client: fin, ack &lt;---- ? server: ack server: fin, ack client: ack 
 Edit: formatting

                              <span>We&#x27;re still looking for the right brand for our upcoming K12 school site project (600 students, 100 staff, 230 chromebooks, 100 computers). Right now we&#x27;re running a smaller Ubiquiti setup (12 switches and 20 Aps, since 2106) without a single failure, but we wanted to step up to a more professional grade brand, investigating Juniper, Ruckus, Forti and Huawei, however the first quotations are expensive, compared to our budget. 
 We need: 
  
24 ports switches: 6 units
 48 ports switches: 15 units
 Eventually 12 aggregation switches (in case there&#x27;s no stacking option, such as for Ubiquiti)
 78 Wifi 6e APs
  
We have received a Netgear offer, but honestly, at that level I&#x27;d rather stay with Ubiquiti. 
 Just wondering if there is any other brand, which deserves to be mentioned, standing in between the top brands and the lower ones (Ubiquiti &amp; Netgear)

Currently, if the device&#x27;s MAC that&#x27;s trying to join isn&#x27;t in Active Directory and assigned to a VLAN with NPS, it gets rejected from joining the network. Is it possible to allow all devices to join that network and just assign them to a guest/isolated VLAN if their MAC isn&#x27;t in AD and still has the ability to assign devices to different VLANs with AD? Thanks for any help in advance!

                              <span>Hi!
 I want to reorganize my network rack and will need some patch cables. I came across cables from FS.com and I love their snagless plugs and the fact they can be ordered in different lengths and colors but those patch cables are too stiff for my liking. They offer the thin cables but I have mixed feelings about those, especially for PoE patches. Can anyone recommend other brands of Cat6 patch cables that can be ordered in custom lengths and colors with snagless plugs at least as good as the FS ones? I think I would also be fine with Cat5e as I rock a 1 Gbps network.

                              <span>I have a need for routing protocol between two routers, however there is a firewall between them. I can establish an iBGP peering between the two routers and they exchange routes successfully. However, the firewall itself is unaware of that routing table and therefore does not know how to route to networks beyond the directly connected. While I can also peer iBGP with the firewall I would prefer not to. How can I set up an iBGP peering without also having the firewall participate in BGP?
 I think I would need some other IGP such as OSPF between the routers and the firewall with redistribution from BGP to OSPF in order to make this work. Does that make sense? It seems like a good compromise.
 ​
 TL;DR: How to peer BGP between two routers without having to peer BGP with the firewall between them?

                              <span>So it’s my first foray into MPO and I got stuck.
 I bought an MPO Type A cable and two Type A MPO-to-12xLC cassettes off FS.
 I know these should be straight 1-1 connected (port 1 &#x3D; port 1, port 2 &#x3D; port 2, etc) so using the regular cross polarised LC-LC patch lead at both ends results in the wrong polarity. So I switched around the LC plugs on one end of one of the LC patch cables but the link is still not coming up.
 I tried different ports and even a totally different set of MPO cable and cassettes.
 Using a simple LC-LC patch cable, eliminating the entire MPO/cassette path between the two end devices works fine.
 It’s all singlemode so I cannot “see the light” to figure out what’s going on, and I don’t have any fiber testing tools.
 What am I missing?

RPF has some options for default-route. But, just wondering if ISPs actually apply it on customer connections or not.

So in a bit of a learning curve here to understand conventions and syntax. With that out of the way I was trying to find Extremes equivalent of MDNS Gateway. So any direction on what extremes equivalent would be helpful.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Currently a helpdesk tech looking to learn more about networks to eventually move to a networks admin role.
 Just wanted to ask for a little help. I have been tasked with moving a switch over to a new site.
 I have the switch with me and have been given the new ip address and hostname i need to assign to the box.
 My question is how would I hook up the device so it&#x27;s discoverable on the network?
 I assume I would have to physically connect one of the ports on the switch to the other stack of switches already there?
 After i do this i assume i just console onto the switch and change the hostname and IP.
 Thanks in advance for the help

                              <span>I&#x27;ve successfully installed PFSense and working fine. This was a response to Nokia gpon modem router crashing but unfortunately the problem continues. 
 PROBLEM ISP supplied Nokia Gpon ont modem router crashes within 24 or Max 48 hours. Replaced Nokia 3 times and works fine for a month and then starts crashing every 24 hours ISP doesn&#x27;t offer bridge mode 
 SETUP -Nokia GPON ont modem router with 100Mbps -VLAN trunnked to a Cisco switch and then -Connected to pfsense double NAT (ISP doesn&#x27;t offer bridge) -Connected to Cisco wlan controller and APs Avg clients connected 200 - pfsense CPU usage at 2% and RAM at 24% temp normal - standard firewall rules except blocked ipv6 broadcasts -rfc1918 disabled on lan and wan -dns resolver and forwarder setup (was having issue with iphones not dnsing, now solved) - daily avg traffic up and down is 500GB - no captive portal - no dual wan - LAN subnet is 192.168.31.0/22 -pfsense wan IP is 192.168.1.2 -ISP modem router lan IP 192.168.1.1 - obviously public IP on isp router 
 This is what I have tried so far 
  
limit sessions to max 20k -session expiry 5 hours (default was 24 hours and sessions were reaching 20K) 
 traffic shaper using limiters limits speed to 20Mbps up and down
 DHCP expiry 6 hours (majority of clients change every 24 hours)
 nftop monitoring (found torrents and blocked)
  
Temp solution is to restart the Nokia and everything works fine. 
 What am I missing here? There is no way to bridge the modem and no other isp serves this area. 
 What is crashing the NoKia gpon ont modem router? 
 How can I use pfsense to detect the issue and solve it?

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I&#x27;ve got a customer who is moving from a flat network into an ACI/SDA, and want to move their various BMS devices in with them. First thing to move in will be the door access.
 Does anyone have much experience of this? As the door access are all on a flat subnet, they work nicely, then I move them into the SDA, do I need to run an L2 transit specifically for their own VN, or is IP Directed Broadcast where I need to be looking?
 The longer term plan is to move the BMS server into the ACI from the current LAN - as a further question, how can that be integrated? I&#x27;m siding with L2 transit..
 Best, CC

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am in search of media converters I can use at the end user ports. Some of the areas under my control are highly secure, so fiber switches are installed with a bunch of end devices that have no fiber ports, only copper.
 I hate media converters, but have ran into many issues; 1. lack of PoE, 2. not passing client disconnect messages, and 3. not passing EAPoL messages (specifically media converter switch issue).
 Has anyone else here experienced similar issues with their media converters, mainly #2 and #3? Do you have any you would recommend?

 Have anyone done some automation around prefix-sets and updating them from a system like Ansible?
 We would like to update a prefix-set based on ddos protection.
 But it seems no one has done prefix-set updating?

                              <span>I recently landed a gig consulting for about $150/hr. Contract is 6 months, but this is government work so it could probably last a year or more.
 Post COVID, with the advent of much more remote work, I&#x27;ve begun exploring taking several lower level positions that are 100% remote to help me reach my financial retirement goals sooner. 
 I feel like my salary is atypical. A 300k job for an engineer is quite rare in my opinion, but on /r/sales it seemed to be suggested that this was quite normal, with people going up to 500-700k and beyond for exceptional performers. 
 Now, working multiple lower end jobs, I can see myself comfortably achieving 300~500k (2-3 jobs). I basically just see myself as my own consulting business, taking on multiple clients who renting my time. Whether they use it or not is up to them. 
 I&#x27;m just hoping to get an engineer&#x27;s take on how much of what is said on /r/sales about those salaries is chest thumping versus reality. Are 250k-300k sales jobs typical? I know SEs that get 220~240 for OTE. 
 I feel like you could be a great salesman, get a shitty account list at the wrong time (for example competing vendor wins project) and then be left with a dry patch and fail to make your number. Idk, it seems like it&#x27;s not always under your control.

                              <span>Hey guys.
 If you have a router in front of your firewall and a small IP block from your ISP do you generally set up a transit VLAN between the router/firewall using your public space and NAT on the firewall or run RFC1918 space between them and NAT at the router? 
 I feel like it would be more beneficial to dPAT at the edge and static NAT whatever on the inside needs to be accessible but I see a lot of people deploying public IP space on the transit VLAN between router/fw and NAT on the FW.

                              <span>This is a dumb question. I recently started dealing with an MPLS network. I have minimal experience here. I am looking at a topology map for this network and see no public IP addresses at the branch offices. I wonder if this was not added by mistake or if I misunderstood something. 
 I guess my question here is if you are using MPLS does each branch location get its own public ip address for the internet? or is everything routed to the primary office then sent out to the internet? 
 If anyone has any material on this, I would really appreciate it.

                              <span>In our area, when company subscribed to leased line , they are provided with big bulky equipment with brand names like nokia, cisco etc.
 Recently, the company subscribe to a leased line (different ISP in our area). And they just provide a small, made of plastic huawei ONU modem. 
 Is this normal nowadays? Although the speed is faster but it feel not the same performance in the old bulky equipment on our old leased line ISP.

                              <span>Does anyone know what would work for connecting Aruba to Fortigate? 
 We tried a FS.com 100gb qsfp breakout DAC on the Aruba to 25gb sfp on the fortigate but it&#x27;s not recognizing anything on the Aruba side. Fortigate can see the transceiver but says unsupported. Aruba acts like nothing exists and unsupported transceivers have been enabled. 
 Aruba says it needs to be an Aruba transceiver. Fortigate says it needs fortigate. Go figure... 
 DAC would be ideal since it&#x27;s a very short run but if anyone knows of optics that would work, that&#x27;s fine too. Trying not to break the bank with 20k transceivers here. Don&#x27;t want to keep buying things that &quot;might&quot; work. 
 Thanks in advance!

As BGP multipath is flow based i tried tcp trace from different ip and different src port still always get same next hop. How can see that loads are shared among next hops?

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone would look at a design I threw together. The goals of this are:
  
The firewalls provide NGFW and NGIPS features between every VLAN and VPN connections to remote sites
 The Nexus switches will be 10Gbps connection for quite a few access switches. Only server and 1 department are depicted in this picture
 Full redundancy
  
My concerns with the design
  
Are the firewalls appropriately placed to provide IPS and FW functions?
 Are the Nexus switches overkill for this topology?
  
Any tips/assistance/comments will be appreciated.

                              <span>Hey friends!
 We ordered three JL675A (Aruba 6100 48 port PoE) from Ingram back in November. They were back ordered at the time, but it&#x27;s now freaking April and there&#x27;s no ETA in sight. 
 Anyone have any insight as to what is going on with Aruba? Is there a better distributor that might have a quicker beat on these?

                              <span>I volunteer for a youth organization that has a camp in BFE. Strangely, BFE has FTTH... Anyway, I co-admin the network spread between the various buildings on the property through fiber. Currently, services just include wireless internet, voip phones, and a couple of hardwired printers. Long range, I&#x27;d love to add some security cameras, but I need to get buy-in from the professional leadership that own/lead the camp. The network is purposefully flat with no vlans for quick repair and troubleshooting if one of the skilled network admins aren&#x27;t on site.
 Historically, we&#x27;ve used older Cisco PoE switches (3750, or thereabouts) purchased off of ebay or the random cast-off from corporate donors along with a Cisco cleanair n-wireless controller and APs for wireless. Generally speaking, we only need 8 PoE ports plus a SFP uplink in 99% of our buildings since other than phones and wireless APs, everything is done over wireless.
 The most common failure mode of our switches are power supply failure, either from old age or occasionally poor power conditions. But, obtaining switches to replace a couple every year has been difficult and adding up. The Cisco 3750s are between $60-100 generally on ebay, but I am wondering if there&#x27;s a better value PoE switch out there that isn&#x27;t so long in the tooth? Yes, I know $100 or less per switch is really a pretty good deal, but when the budget is $0 and you have a very small pool of people willing to donate money or equipment, it gets demoralizing

 Hi, can someone please point me in the right direction here with the API?
 I&#x27;m just trying to do a test and add this IP above!
 But i&#x27;m getting this response back everytime:
 Failed to add address object. Status code: 400 {&#x27;code&#x27;: 3, &#x27;message&#x27;: &#x27;Missing Query Parameter: vsys&#x27;, &#x27;details&#x27;: [{&#x27;@type&#x27;: &#x27;CauseInfo&#x27;, &#x27;causes&#x27;: [{&#x27;code&#x27;: 7, &#x27;module&#x27;: &#x27;panui_restapi&#x27;, &#x27;description&#x27;: &#x27;Missing Query Parameter: vsys&#x27;}]}]} 
 I&#x27;m not use to the PA API and in my web gui i can see vsys1.
 I&#x27;m not really sure where to go to be honest and every resource out there doesn&#x27;t really give you straight answer or any full examples which is mental as well.

 I am assuming it will go further than 100m. Does anybody know max length?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 i am trying to troubleshoot why some OT devices in a big vlan ~281 hosts are not responding to ping after some time.
 We have a Client where every 30min a ftp connection to a ot devices is established. Sometimes we get the notification that the ftp transfer failed. The client is in a seperate vlan.
 I tried to sniff packets from the ftp client and the only thing I see is TCP Retransmissions of the first SYN packet everytime.
 Then I looked at the port where the ftp server is connected and I see that the TCP Syn Packets are arriving there. Also I can ping other devices on the same vlan during this time but I don&#x27;t get SYN ACK packets back from the server.
 I see that the ftp server sends &quot;Who has 192.168.100.254? Tell 192.168.100.250&quot; then the Gateway responds with &quot;192.168.100.254 is at 00:09:0f:09:1c:be&quot;. It is like this over and over until you restart the ot ftp device. The delay between the arp who has tell is 6,9,5,11,27 seconds.
 What could that be? A ping also from the same vlan to the ot ftp device during this time is also not possible.
 EDITED: IT&#x27;s 281 not 1022 active Hosts the Subnet&#x27;s size would be 1022 Hosts but only 281 Hosts are currently connected.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been running Fortinet &amp; Ubiquiti switches and AP&#x27;s for a while, but now we might have a good line on Datto equipment.
 On the one hand, I REALLY like the Fortinet devices because of SPOG management and the NAC-lite features when integrated with FortiGate has been useful in our more secure environments.
 Ubiquiti is just plain affordable for our SMB clients and while it&#x27;s nowhere near as feature rich, the base features are pretty easy enough to use that my techs don&#x27;t need to know ALL the networking stuff to do some basic troubleshooting if they have to. Plus, the flex mini switch is honestly a godsend - a $30 managed/ish POE-powered switch is a fantastic alternative to some random box that gets added when someone needs just one more port.
 Our company uses Kaseya which means we could manage the network from our RMM platform - a potentially huge benefit. But I only know Datto from its software, not as a networking company, so I&#x27;m curious if their hardware actually holds up

                              <span>Hoping someone can make some recommendations here - I&#x27;m looking for an equivalent switch, both in capability and cost, to the EdgeSwitch PoE+ 48 (500W) from Ubiquiti as they&#x27;ve been out of stock for a long time now and I&#x27;m not sure when, if ever, they will be back. 
 I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more if necessary, but these were a great value and the UI/functionality was perfect, especially at this price point.
 Does such a switch exist?

                              <span>We have a few remote sites that are connected via fiber that have Cisco 2960X switches. The sites are on a /30 and at the remote switch we are just using a static route to point everything to headquarters but also have ospf enabled.
 Some sites are small, with just a few users, and a couple sites are larger with access points, cameras, etc.
 If we replace our aging 2960x&#x27;s at remote sites, Meraki has two models we are looking at:
 MS225 (no ospf, but capable of 16 static routes)
 MS250 (ospf, also does static routes)
 Do we &quot;need&quot; to pay extra for the MS250 in this case? Does OSPF matter at the edge if we are only using one strand of fiber?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a legacy ASA with an inside and outside interface. On this ASA we do some NAT, routing etc
 I need to reroute the inside traffic to another device, I remember messing with nameif interfaces can delete parts of config. 
 What is best practise for moving the “nameif” to a new interface without losing parts of config ?

                              <span>Hi all. It came to my mind what if you have like 3-4 vendor certification like Cisco, Aruba, Forti whatever and all associated recertification requirements. I mean after a number of different certifications will you all the time have to start studiing for recertifications or will different certifications work together in such a way that one renewal will also help the other renewal? Are there any examples? For example, does one get extra learning points for CCNP if they have other professional certifications?
 Thanks for all the replies

                              <span>Hello Networkers,
 I have been trying to configure 802.1X with EAP-TLS in a Windows domain for a while now. Using freshly installed Win Server 2022 for DC and PKI, and ClearPass in a Lab environment (was set up after the configuration didn&#x27;t work in the production environment). 
 Certificates for computer and user authentication are distributed cleanly via autoenrollment and authentication on the network works fine - but only after the user GPOs have already been processed and the user is already on the desktop. With this, the GPOs for folder redirects and drive mappings don&#x27;t work because the client can&#x27;t reach the file server without user authentication. Wireshark shows me that the client first tries to get to the file server long before 802.1X user authentication takes place.
 If I disconnect the network connection while logged in and re-establish it, authentication works immediately. 
 Microsoft support has not been able to help us so far and Aruba is not aware of the problem either.
 Do you have any tips?

 I&#x27;m keen to see what solutions people are using out there. We are currently mostly using Ansible to pull the info down, then parse it and display in a custom built tool.

 I also looked into just using USMT, but Microsoft is suggestion using a Win 7 AIK? That seems suspicious.
 ​
 Does anyone have any suggestions on what works nice and cleanly? Preferably for little to no cost?

 I have a situation where I need to find a way to retain BitLocker recovery keys outside of Azure AD/On-prem AD.
 We are trying to use a new auditing system that can recover deleted AD/Azure devices but not the recovery key leaf. Are there any products or means to pull those keys from AD and securely retain them outside of those systems?
 I&#x27;ve looked around but no products have really stood out as a stand-alone option for this situation.
 Thanks in advance!

Does anyone actually know how to do things like theming and page creation or does everyone just follow examples and then piece it together and then forget to document it?

                              <span>I have a user where we assigned the Audio licenses two hours ago but for some reason in Outlook, the number does not show up when creating a meeting.
 It does show up if I create a meeting within TEAMS app itself but not in outlook. I tried disabling/enabling the addin with no affect so far.
 Going to the user in Teams Admin, I see Audio Conferencing is ENABLEd as well so I am not sure why outlook not giving the audio link. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey guys. I’m knees deep in a cloning project for 17 laptops using Clonezilla and I’m wondering why you would use Sysprep in audit mode. 
 In my case- all my laptops that are getting imaged are all the same model. 
 After I’m done building my reference image, I plan on Sysprepping with /oobe/generalize and shutdown options. (I’ll also make sure I delete the user I’ve been using to install everything and create a new “offline account” to run sysprep so as not to trigger the Windows Store from interfering with Sysprep. Before reboot I’ll clone. 
 Let’s say after I sysprep, I realize I forgot a piece of software, or want to tweak a setting. 
 Wouldn’t it be just as easy to boot into the oobe, make any changes and sysprep again rather than going into Audit mode? You can sysprep the same image 1001 times now. Perhaps Audit mode was a better option when sysprep was limited to 3 times?
 Looking for an easy explanation of why/when to use Audit mode in sysprep. 
 Thanks guys!
 Edit to ask another question:
 Can you unbox a new laptop with an OEM image of Windows 10 , customize then sysprep it? Or do you need to install a Volume Lic version of your own on the new laptop? I have a MAK license.

Root access disabled via SSH
 Limited user provisioned
 Only able to access the machine with an SSH key
 fail2ban enabled
 UFW firewall only exposing the necessary ports
  
How well would you assess the security based on the above?
 Is there anything else I should do to have give myself peace of mind the boxes will stay secure?Would you recommend installing unattended updates?
 Are there any tools that can assess the security of a box? And make adjustments? 
 I&#x27;m a bit new to this, I&#x27;m interested to know what the industry standards are.
 Much appreciated!

                              <span>I work at a pretty good sized bank. Senior Management wishes to give out our Guest network SSID and password, without using our Network Access Control solution, to our customers. I was told that &quot;those portals are clunky and a terrible customer experience&quot;. I argued that the NAC would require them to resign every 8 hours (i.e. daily) and prevent our lobby from becoming a Cafe. I argued that the portal will provide a disclosure laying out terms of usage, etc. I also argued that there&#x27;s virtually no difference, in terms of effort, between typing a password vs. typing an email address.
 Any other arguments I can make to non-technical people?

                              <span>I really messed up today. I accidentally attached some other clients&#x27; emails while sending an email with a bunch of attachments to a new client. He totally freaked out and started asking why and what could happen to him with other clients.
 I&#x27;m fully aware it&#x27;s my mistake and this should not happen should&#x27;ve checked twice, even though I counted the attachments before clicking send. I&#x27;m not making excuses, but this Monday came with a bunch of incidents and I was backing up an absent colleague of mine. I&#x27;m a junior and I really screwed up.
 The situation is bad, I don&#x27;t know what will happen tomorrow.

                              <span>First off just want to say thank you for all the helpful info I’ve gotten here over the years. Never thought I would have one of these post but here we are admins. I have had 2 interviews today and pretty sure I bombed both. One I already know for sure. I am only interviewing now because my current remote job denied me working in another state and just said no which I don’t understand because we have out of state workers. 
 I’m tired of failing technical questions to dumb easy shit I haven’t used in 8 years and not getting a job. I’m tired of being laid off job after job due to shitty management, being outsourced, Covid 19, or being forced to look because my current position won’t help. I used to love doing this job, I have for over 10 years now, but I think God, the moon, or something is telling me to change it up. I’m frustrated, tired, and just pissed that I am 36 and having to potentially change careers because if I don’t my mental health is gonna send my physical into a spiral and I leave my wife a widow at 40. 
 If you read all of this thank you for joining my TedRant. I’m gonna go for a walk and try not to break down anymore today.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m just kinda going crazy, and needed some advice! I applied for a call center position with a small company in my home town. I got called for the interview, and when I showed up, they immediately said that they needed me on their IT department based on my Resume (10+ years of self employed computer repair experience). I&#x27;ve only done low level repair work, and some minor networking, and I was completely honest about that. Well they hired me as a salaried junior network engineer, and just told me to learn as much as I could, and that they understood that this would be a learning process for me. I&#x27;ve just finished my 90 days and I have had everything dumped on me by my supervisor from configuring firewall rules to setting up domain controllers with nothing more than a &quot;you&#x27;ll figure it out&quot;. Thankfully I&#x27;ve been able to handle all the craziness thrown at me, mainly because I&#x27;m excellent at troubleshooting, but I&#x27;ve been terrified this whole time, and I&#x27;m extremely fearful that I&#x27;ll mess something important up. I know I&#x27;m not qualified to do sysadmin duties just yet, but they&#x27;re forcing me to do it. I&#x27;ve been made global admin within my first month of being here. Is this just imposter syndrome, and I should keep going and pray for the best, or should I let them know that I&#x27;m feeling overwhelmed before I face an issue that could hurt my reputation. Sorry it&#x27;s so long just freaking out lol

                              <span>Was hoping to reach out to see if any of you have any thoughts on this. I have a M365 tenant of about 70 users, and they are all online, using OneDrive/Teams/Sharepoint. Have been on this system for almost 4 years. Been very happy with it.
 But over the last 6 months or so, we are seeing a dramatic climb in space usage, and we have had to provision more sharepoint space accordingly. But...we dont know whats causing it.
 Most of the teams sites are private, so they dont show up as anything more than 0 when looking at space. And powershell reports to CSV dont show much change of hard drive space at all. 
 For example, over the weekend, 10GB used up. 
 Frankly, Im unimpressed with how M365 reports some of this, so I figure there must be a better way, but maybe not. Thought I would flip it to you all to see if anyone has run into this before, and some pointers?

We started the search for a replacement and are interviewing a fellow with years of experience, many certificates, and a Masters degree in Cybersecurity. As a full-time worker and a full-time student, I am so excited for this department to not fully rest on my shoulders and have a mentor to teach me the ways. I am counting down the minutes until we hire someone new!

 ​
 I receive weekly scans from the client who uses a Tenable (Nessus) scanner and this week&#x27;s finding included a High finding on a MS server. The finding is as follows:
 Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (September 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (September 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (October 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (December 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (December 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (January 2023) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (February 2023) Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (February 2023) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (April 2023) 
 My question is : 
 1- is it install enough Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (April 2023) and Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (February 2023) this finding? 
 ​
 thanks,

                              <span>I am checking to see if anyone else has had any issues with SPNEGO after installing the April patches on a 2012 R2 domain controller? We have any application that started failing authentication and it didn&#x27;t work again until we uninstalled the patches from the DCs. This app uses a keytab file using RC4 and we have updated the service account msds-supportedencryption type to RC4 (which is what allowed it to work after the November patches). Interestingly enough, another application using the same keytab / service account (I know bad practice) continued to work fine but it was using our updated 2019 domain controllers (the broken app can&#x27;t use these ones at the moment). I didn&#x27;t see anything specific in the patch info that would be a smoking gun for this issue.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I&#x27;m fairly new to GPO and I&#x27;m trying to create a task to get all PC&#x27;s to reboot every Friday. I&#x27;ve created an OU and placed all PC&#x27;s that need to have this applied in there and created a schedule task policy against the OU. I tested this by having my own PC in this ou, and it was the only one at the time for testing purposes, and it worked. Now that I&#x27;ve moved the rest of the PC&#x27;s in the OU it doesn&#x27;t work. To make sure I&#x27;m getting the policy applied I run gpupdate /r and see it there and when i run gpupdate /force... Immediately I open up task scheduler and I don&#x27;t see the task the policy is supposed to create.... The task was there during the testing though.... So I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong...🤔

                              <span>Context: We started using Defender as our AV for endpoints about a year ago since it&#x27;s included with out MS licensing. Prior to that, we were using ESET, and we are currently using it in our server environment.
 Right now, my boss and I are trying to figure out if Defender is a good fit for our on-prem servers. The only critical thing that they&#x27;re doing is DNS and DHCP management. None of them are open to the world. We have some internal teams using apps on different servers, but they&#x27;re not critical to the operation.
 Has anyone used Defender in their server environment? Why or why not? I&#x27;ll be transparent in saying that I&#x27;m not super familiar with either Defender nor ESET and am currently doing my research. I just like coming here to see what other people&#x27;s experiences are.

 Hey everyone,
 With the unknowns in the economy, which lower cost of living city (prefer small to mid-sized) would you suggest relocating to? Currently in a major city - new location should have plenty of available IT jobs (excluding help-desk). Please include pros and cons for suggestions. This is for the US. Considering the midwest and perhaps south, southeast. However, open to options if the area is right - relatively safe and housing options are not the size of a shoebox.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi!
 We host a domain-controller (2016) where they have been using folder redirection for some time.
 All of the devices are located on 4 other sites, connected with site-to-site VPN to the DC on the gateway-level.
 I want to revert this and move everything back to the local userprofiles.
 I ticked the box &quot;Redirect the folder back to the local userprofile location when policy is removed&quot;, made sure that was spinning for some days before setting &quot;Not configured&quot; on all the folder redirections one at a time every other day. (Just to prevent slowdowns)
 Nothing happened.
 Tried enabling one of them and set it to &quot;Redirect to the local userprofile location&quot; and restarted.
 Got an error in Event Viewer (502) stating that the path couldn&#x27;t be reached, it could be offline, even though I can ping and browse to \server\folder redirection.
 Any ideas on what might be wrong or other ways to move everything back to the respective user&#x27;s local profile?

                              <span>Looking to see if anyone has any pointers on where I can look for what is causing this issue.
 Domain joined W11 laptop with O365 installed and using Windows Remote Desktop. Using a L2TP/IPSec VPN to connect back to the office (when working from home). 
 When the user is in the office there is not a single issue. When they work from home through the VPN their account gets locked constantly. I have not seen any issues in AAD or on their computer. I have tried looking at the logs on my local AD as well but can not seem to find anything. I know I must be missing something.

                              <span>I got this email last Thursday, and I have a open ticket with Microsoft about it. We use DUO and have it on about 250 users and we are federated with Azure for DUO. The MS support agent who called me back had never seen this memo before and was confused... so he would have to get back to me after he investigated. I do have a ticket open with MS about this because I am very concerned about how this will impact our company. 
 Has anybody else receive this notification and using another MFA other than the native Microsoft MFA in O365?

 I&#x27;m doing this with an administrator account and adding the same permissions that other users have. 
 Thanks for the help :)

                              <span>Hi
 I have a new computer that is installed with a local computer account.
 The user has a Microsoft Bussiness Basic licence.
 We bought a Office 2019 proffesional plus license online.
 ( i like to add that we did this over a 100 times before and that went well all the time.)
 ok so now the issue:
 I start 1 of the office applications ( i does not matter wich one. in this case i use word)
  
The screen pop up comes that asks for a product key, so i put in the product key
 
i press activate office
 
a new screen comes that asks me to sign in.
 
when i enter the account its shows this account does not exist
 
 The same occurs when i log in to word first and then try to activate, same bad result.
 That why its so weird, ik can login to the office 2019 app and it reconizes the account, when i go activate office it shows account unknown. 
 I hope someone can help me....

I have the latest ADMX templates available for this as well, and I am trying to set the wallpaper for all users with the Desktop Wallpaper Policy in user configuration. It appears that this will not work no matter where I move the file on the machine. I am currently storing it in a few locations including, Public Downloads, the sysprep folder. It says it should work with a local path on the machine but it is not, however, it does work on the lock screen in the same location in the sysprep folder. Is there anything I can do to make this work? Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I want to monitor for example the following services:
 - Microsoft Intune (MDM)
 - Apple services (Apple Business Manager, Device Enrollment Program etc.)
 - Google services (Zero Touch Portal)
 - Samsung services (Knox Mobile Enrollment)
 etc. 
 Does anyone if there are any &quot;API&quot; ressources available?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try to make this as brief as possible. We&#x27;re in the process of transitioning off our AS400 system. IBM said they would provide us with technical (hardware &amp; software) support until August (to get support even up until this date has taken direct appeals to IBM for extensions on our support contract). I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but that story and timeline has changed to April 30th.
 (I believe it was simply human error on our end, a misread or something, but that is really irrelevant here and now.) 
 So, now we are scrambling to find a viable option for hardware support for this interim period (4-6 months) until we&#x27;ve fully switched to a new system. And to be clear, the team that setting up our new system is not equipped to handle support requests that might come in for the existing AS400 system.
 ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: we are a rather small - I&#x27;d like to say almost mom/pop type - manufacturer in Northern New Jersey (Carlstadt, Bergen County). They&#x27;ve used the AS400 for nearly 30/35 years and what little tech expertise we had, has long ago left. I&#x27;m a new (~2 years) web designer and developer (and unfortunately, the all around IT person) here and the only person with adequate and competent technical skills. So i&#x27;ve been asked for help with this. 
 I&#x27;d be happy to answer questions if anyone has any relevant, but I am hoping experts out there might have some solid advice for me on where to start looking. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE TO ANYONE THAT TAKES THE TIME TO READ AND APPLY, I APPRECIATE IT.

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m curious how people have approached structuring non-production environments with respect to Active Directory. 
 Are you isolating your non-production (eg: dev/uat/preproduction) environment sytems/users in separate OUs but under the main/production AD domain? Do you use a separate AD domain in the same forest? 
 Any input or suggestions are appreciated! Thank you

                              <span>Has anyone used Intunes and Bitlocker before? We had it setup inhouse and used the pin option. Now we&#x27;ve moved it to intunes we have the pin option but also want the password only option for machines that can&#x27;t have Windows 11.
 I have some machines that are having issues with the password option. TPM isn&#x27;t available but you can use password instead. Type in the password when the pop-up appears and it goes to encrypt but just throws back &quot;Failed to encrypt C&quot; but gives no error.
 Anyone had issues with this before?

 I started a business and needing a mailserver. I have different domains on my Cloudflare account which i want to use.
 Im going to use google workspace mainly with domain A.
 I also have domain B which is used by my services (git etc. to send emails)
 I also have domain C and D which are for my customers. 
 So im looking at a mail hosting with different tiers for example a lite tier with almost none features except sending emails and a tier which can be used as a daily mail.
 Does anyone know such a hoster?
 Looked at Mailbox.org and Zoho mail but idk if there is something better.
 Thank you all! Would be nice if someone could help me!

                              <span>Our Outlook signatures contain images promoting our upcoming events. We rotate these images every 2-3 weeks.
 Currently, our marketing teams sends an email around, asking everyone to update their signature, but this (obviously) is very annoying and I quite often see users with outdated signatures.
 What I tried:
  
Disclaimer in Microsoft 365 Exchange - not feasible because it doesn&#x27;t support images and would require IT to build HTML from whatever the marketing team comes up with.
 Set-OutlookSignatures - Doesn&#x27;t seem reliable. I had it fail for some mailboxes and couldn&#x27;t figure out the reason for the errors &quot;mailbox does not exist&quot;. It&#x27;s decently documented, but it&#x27;s OSS after all with no real support.
 Third party solutions - They cost like 5 bucks per user per month and I cannot get that budget approved. Also, an Outlook plugin alone doesn&#x27;t really do it, because it cannot be used on Mac, phones or Outlook Web.
  
Ideally, I need a way to attach content from a Word document to all emails, so that the marketing team can change and update the signature on their own. We have around 35 employees.
 Any reliable, low-maintenance, not-too-expensive solutions you would recommend for an organziation with 35 employees?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking for a server lift for our server rooms. Untill now we&#x27;ve handled all servers/storage by hand, and in ways that would send a health and safety officer off to go rock themselves to sanity in a corner. 
 Our server rooms are wrongly set out, but thats the way it&#x27;s going to remain... We have pretty small &quot;aisles&quot; Infront of each rack, so if we were to get a lift it would need to be quite small wheel based.
 Do any of you have something in mind? Either electric or manual crank is fine.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m the only IT guy in our company. I took a one week leave. A small company about 20 people. Management refused to hire another IT guy because of &quot;budget constraints&quot;. I got mentally burned out and took a 1 week leave. I was overthinking about tickets, angry calls and network outage. After one week, I went back to work again and to my surprise, the world didn&#x27;t burn. No network outage.

                              <span>Firstly I wanna say I&#x27;m a bit of a &quot;noob&quot; right now when it comes to this stuff, but I&#x27;m trying to understand. Just got a job as an It Support which won&#x27;t include just regular helpdesk tasks but also more and more administrator stuff etc... So there&#x27;s a few things I wanna ask.
 We&#x27;re a company of around 60 employees and are expanding pretty fast, so we have to put some more effort on the safety side of things. Right now we have a shared network domain (is this the right term?) Where we have access to the same files etc... Now we&#x27;d also like to have a local? domain, where all users would fall under one place and at login you&#x27;d have that thing where you can log in to user or into administrator. We also have 4-5 MacOS users. How would that go, to have windows and mac on the same AD? What to use? Co-worker was mentioning LDAP and FREEIPA? I also saw something about NoMAD? Is there a way to have two factor authentication to log-in to windows?
 + when we&#x27;d have all of that set up, what would be the best tool to manage everything? Right now we&#x27;re using Synology I think, for granting access to users for certain files... I also saw something about JAMF?
 ​
 Sorry if all of this is written poorly, as I said, currently my understanding of all off this is not the best, but I&#x27;d like to come up with a suggestion or two of &quot;my own&quot;, if any of you would have a suggestion or two or point me in the right direction, that would be great.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>i just installed windows server 2022 on my vps &amp; when i try to install an ethernet driver, it doesn&#x27;t give an installation popup of &quot;Would you like to install this device software?&quot; but it just automatically installs the driver &amp; shows a confirmation of &quot;windows has successfully updated your drivers&quot;. but the internet connection still remains offline even after reboot. 
 i had previously used the same driver on a different vps provider (vultr) &amp; it worked flawlessly there meaning after installing the ethernet driver, it instantly connected to the internet.
 edit: i&#x27;m thinking becoz the windows not asking my permission to install the driver, it for some reason isn&#x27;t installing the driver correctly even though it appears on device manager menu. i don&#x27;t know what exactly is the issue, so i&#x27;m just spitballing here.
 Ethernet driver: Red Hat VirtlO Ethernet Adapter
 My VPS Spec:
 EPYC (3rd Gen) 4 vCores @ 2.8+ GHz
 8 GB RAMDDR4 ECC
 160 GB SSD RAID 10 (NVMe)

 I’m seeking the internet’s help on any other logs (client or server) that I might have missed with a problem that impacted many DHCP clients in a virtualized datacenter network.
 Over the course of about 15 hours, nearly 45 virtual servers lost their DNS settings. Our VMs are all Windows Server based and our DHCP server is Windows DHCP.
 They changed to 0.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.0 based on a bonafide observation of a sample machine (via console) and through S1 logging on the below changed registry value.
 I correlated our S1 logs showing when the registry value DhcpNameServer changed from what they’re supposed to be to 2 x quad zeros with my DHCP server logs and I see a lot of action on that registry value that didn’t correlate to a DHCP log entry and I also see lots of correlation befor…</span>

Can’t reach google, Microsoft, etc. This is on purpose. But we have around 40 VMs, several switches, router, etc. What is the best software that can monitor most, if not all aspects. I’m mostly interested in the networking pieces and if there are issues with them, but also curious if some great software can monitor servers as well. Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m a solo admin with two sites and roughly 100 users combined. Both sites have a mix of different OSes and device types.
 I&#x27;m struggling to find tools to effectively manage all my systems and I&#x27;m looking for &quot;turn-key&quot; or &quot;set-and-forget&quot; tools that I can implement to make things easier. Both orgs are non-profits so budget is going to be the deciding factor.
 I&#x27;ve looked at a few FOSS options for various tasks, but the vast majority are self-hosted and for someone who has next to no Linux, Docker, etc experience and no time to maintain them, a lot of FOSS isn&#x27;t viable.
 One tool in particular that I&#x27;m looking for is a way to manage logs from various sources (firewall, servers, etc.).

                              <span>So I have currently a Server 2016 based RDS farm using roaming profiles. Everything is working just fine there. Whenever we install office in the OfficeDeploymentTool config file I have the information to use roaming licensing tokens
 Property Name&#x3D;&quot;SCLCacheOverride&quot; Value&#x3D;&quot;1&quot; /&gt;   
 Everything works just the way it should on those servers.
 So now im looking to move up to Server2019 based RDS host. I install office the same way, but on the 2019 host it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever download the token. When you open office products you are greeted with a &quot;Sign in to setup office&quot; you click ok then get &quot;Activate Office&quot; At that point it ask for your email. Plug that information in but then it never ask for a password. Then all your office products get the pink banner up top stating &quot;problem with shared computer licensing&quot; I looked at the registry entries and those are correct. If I log into the 2016 RDS, activate office then copy one of the tokens. I can log out of the 2016 then come back to the 2019 and the token roams over and office is activated and just fine. Its just the initial downloading of the tokens that 2019 seems to be having a problem with. Is there something I&#x27;m missing about getting it working on 2019?

I was basically doing junior admin work or close to it. On top of actively engineering solutions that were truly automated. But my Job titled never really reflected it, in fact they had no &quot;sys admins&quot; on the docket. You where either a Tech or an Engineer. And Senior Tech&#x27;s did a lot of &quot;sys admin work&quot;. 
 How do I sell my self to a Sys. Admin team? Or even a Support team at this rate?
  
So I&#x27;m having a fustrating job search. Current Company is total ass, gave me lay off notice due soon. (Yet now their talking different after making me go through that, training my own replacements currently! My replacement(s) aren&#x27;t not faring well despite me actually trying to train them! ) 
 ​
 I&#x27;m super fed up and want to leave and collect severance anyways.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into an offline archival solution for a NAS that has something like 12TB. It&#x27;s a TrueNAS with 2 vdevs with 3 5tb each. I&#x27;m mainly storing immutable information, photos. I also have a different pool on the same NAS that has snapshots but I would like to move the snapshots out of the same hardware to make it more robust. I really would like to avoid cloud storage and I&#x27;m looking for a cost effective solution. 
 From the information that I was able to gather, looks like M Disk Bluray could be the solution. Anyone have any experience with it or have any other suggestions?

                              <span>I came into an environment with 100 windows servers and no central management of them.
 What is the most modern thing with the least friction people are doing these days?
 SCCM is overkill I think and I don&#x27;t have a person to manage that platform anyway.
 Does anyone have experience with azure arc? even if we have no workloads on azure that looks like an interesting option.
 is there anything else I haven&#x27;t thought of?
 The environment is relatively static. GPOs and WSUS take care of patching right now. Most of the applications running on these machines are unique snowflakes that don&#x27;t work well with automation. So things are...ok.
 However whenever we want to make a small change to servers or deploy some kind of agent or new tool, its a pain in the ass without central management.

We&#x27;re moving to a 150,000 sq ft facility and the owner is insisting all network access be wireless. I get pushback every time I recommend running cable. 200 users with mostly desktop workstations. We don&#x27;t have a VDI. Some controls for the large mill machines need to be networked and are running embedded Win2k. Wireless network coverage is 20 access points, 5 medium density for office areas, 15 low density for manufacturing floor and was quoted and approved by the facilities manager. Supervisor offices have been built in several areas on manufacturing floor with metal roofs.
 Donations of copium greatly appreciated.

 I hope someone can shed some light on the issue one of my customers is having. About a month ago someone purchased a domain that was very similar to my customers domain. They started sending a bunch of phishing emails. Long story short, the phishing domain got banned and removed but ever since then, the legitimate customer domain has been having email delivery problems. By that, I mean that SOME users&#x27; emails in/out and going straight to spam. They use Office 365 as their email platform and cloudflare as DNS. Further to that they use SendGrid for marketing emails.
 I message traced user A- some emails that he sends go to spam. This also applied to incoming emails.
 Message tracked user B- emails work just fine, they go to inbox. Same for incoming emails, they go to inbox right awa…</span>

 I got surprised today when i used Googles find my device feature to locate my phone to see that there were 2 devices signed in to with the account, my phone and another phone model which i don&#x27;t have or have ever owned
 So i went into account settings and saw that the strange device was signed in to more than 100 days ago which is strange because i had not created that account
 Could it mean my new account was someone&#x27;s previous gmail account that they deleted ?

 Our infra contains 2 main offices (Site1, Site2) connected via site-to-site VPN connection (different location in the same city) and both have AD running under 2 DCs on each site. In the coming months, we&#x27;ll be having 2 extra branch offices (in different locations) as well.
 From what I&#x27;m reading, the best case scenario is to go with a two-tier PKI ADCS consisting of: 
  
CA-01 - RootCA - No domain-joined, running on a VM and shut down.
 CA-02 - Subordindate CA - Domain-joined running on physical server - Site1
 CA-03 - Subordindate CA - Domain-joined running on physical server - Site2
  
The use for ADCS is to provide user/computer authentication on the local network (LAN, WiFi), user authentication for VPN/Remot…</span>

                              <span>Hi there got a file I have had in a public bucket for a while and recently had to replace it, normally what I have done is just download the file modify it keeping the same file name then delete whats in the bucket and reupload to s3 and the url would be the same as the filename is untouched. I went to do this recently though and the old url isnt accessible &quot;The specified key does not exist&quot;. How can I change the url of the object to what it used to be so its accessible from the old url??? Any help would be awesome as I am stumped on how to do it

                              <span>All active DCs are on 2019 so we are able to raise it. Just have an old RODC on 2008 that doesn&#x27;t have domain services installed anymore which needs to be removed before going ahead.
 Does it matter what OS domain joined computers are on? From everything I&#x27;ve read only the lowest DC server version matters. So if you have a 2016 DC and a 2022 DC you can raise to 2016 domain functional level.

                              <span>We have a local AD with synced users to Azure. Password writeback was enabled in both directions and this worked in the past. Since a few months this somehow broke. Users get the message that there are connection problems when trying to change their password. It&#x27;s clearly not a connection problem but something in the configuration that broke. Only way to change the password is on the local AD. Admins can&#x27;t change it in AzureAD either. I&#x27;ve already tested the sync and password settings with the AD sync tool and everything showed as working. Any pointers where to look to fix this problem?

                              <span>I really can&#x27;t decide between those to options. Since I&#x27;m part of the lastpass breach I don&#x27;t want to have a cloude based password manager anymore. In my opinion, my network / server wouldn&#x27;t be that attractive to hacker like servers from bitwarden.
 But I&#x27;m not sure what I should set up. Would you trust the open source solution vaultwarden, which is bitwarden in some way or rather pay bitwarden.
 I want to install the password manager on my NAS using docker. The passwordmanger won&#x27;t be open to the WAN, only my DSM for (Drive, Photos, ...)
 What would you pick?

                              <span>I was reading somewhere about this but I am not sure if it&#x27;s true for most devices. Does this true for SSD disks? Can I have an SSD disk and periodically (once a week) connect it to a power supply or a computer to &quot;refresh&quot; the charges? Is there a way to determine if my USB flash drive refreshes the data automatically when I plug it in?
 Or it&#x27;s best to delete the data with the Secure Erase unit command or similar method and then rewrite it?
 If I make a second copy does this guarantee to make a copy of the data or there are algorithms for deduplication that prevent it? My experience is that writing the data twice is about twice as slow, therefore I assume no deduplication happens. But I am not sure about all devices.
 My main concern with not erasing the drive and writing the data again is that the file allocation table may get damaged because some of the bits are not overwritten (refreshed). And I may get a random gibberish when I try to read my files.

 Would intune be the best option here? We are not fully in the cloud. Over half of users office is migrated to office 365. Is SCCM still an option

                              <span>A little background before I ask the question. I have been in IT for over 10 years. At my current job for 7 of that 10. Started as a deskside tech then network admin and as of 4 years ago a sysadmin. My manager at the time saw me doing more than just the network so he wanted to give me a different title as I worked with all the systems. The only way for me to make more than the 5% a year raise is to become a SR sysadmin. We had three SR sysadmins and then me up until 2 years ago when 2 randomly left. I stepped up and became lead on all major projects because I was skilled in many areas. The remaining SR was just apps and that is it. I worked with the Manger at the time to change my title and he wanted to base the requirements off of the past SRs job descriptions. I was ok with this because my skills and projects matched it. Thought I had it in the bag.... then the manager left.... nothing had been finalized or in writing. A new manager has been brought in and believes a SR is based off how many Certificates you have. Nothing is changing his mind. I asked if they would pay for them and he said yes. So I want to brush up on them and just start scheduling. I have had plenty early on to help my growth but they expired. He probably does not believe my talent and I want to hold him to it. Kind of a malicious compliance. Maybe he is trying to save money while under paying me for as long as he can...
 Question: would it become an issue if I started taking one every two weeks? Would is cause me any issues? Like would they question whether I was cheating or not? 
 I attend yearly training for any upcoming projects. As an example. When we moved to palo alto firewalls I took a week long boot camp and got certified 4 years ago.(expired in oct) We planned to move to azure. So I took another bootcamp to get ready. About to attend a bootcamp for my CISSP.

                              <span>I have a scenario where for reasons beyond my control it seems, I have a cellular interface that is losing its IP that it gets from the provider and the only way to get it back is to bounce the interface. I have created this sla to bounce the port if ping fails. 
 My issue is, it seems that it bounces the port just as the router is completed booting and does not give any time for a genuine IP to be received. So essentially my sla is too sensitive, and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s required or whether its possible to have it delay sla checking on boot to let everything settle in.
 ​
 All advice is welcome, thanks

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m trying to find an SMB grade router to replace the one we currently have (TP-Link Archer MR400 w/ 4G LTE), in order to support more devices.
 Some context:
 Currently, we already have around ~60 devices and we&#x27;re starting to see problems with some devices being unreachable once we add new ones to the network.
 These are IoT devices (Shelly1 and Shelly Pro1), so the network traffic, while busy (mainly MQTT keep alive messages and similar payloads), shouldn&#x27;t be the actual problem, rather it seems we&#x27;re just hitting the maximum number of supported devices connected simultaneously.
 We have two locations (~400m distance) that share the same network. The IoT devices are located in two cabinets in each site.
 On the main site, we have a mix of Shelly1&#x27;s connected via Wi-Fi and Shelly Pro1&#x27;s connected by cable (RJ45) to the router.
 On the second site we only have Shelly1&#x27;s, which connect to an access point that is then connected via cable to the router in the main site.
 Technically, most devices connect to the router by cable, rather than Wi-Fi.
 Given we&#x27;ll be adding more devices (cable only, no Wi-Fi) in the near future, we want something that could handle from 100 to ~200 devices.
 I found related questions here, here and here, but didn&#x27;t quite help.
 Could you share your experiences in similar scenarios and what you have used?
 I appreciate your time.
 Cheers,
 Q

 For whatever reason i&#x27;m getting: 
 Failed to generate API key: Invalid Credential 
 to which i have no clue why! It IS the correct username and password and its the default admin account as well.
 Anyone any ideas?

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m about to start a pretty large migration of Cisco ASA firewalls to Palo Alto 3320&#x27;s, the main things i&#x27;m looking to migrate are the correct object groups (there is a LOT of crap DM_INLINE object groups that i want to leave off), firewall rules and NAT rules.
 I was thinking of doing a manual self audit and skipping any potential issues that the migration tool might bring up or if there is a learning curve involved in terms of setting the thing up.
 If i did set it up, would i be able to click and choose what object groups i&#x27;d like to migrate? Same for rules and NAT rules?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I want to ask you if the firewall cluster ( that is draw in the diagram, bellow it&#x27;s a similar diagram ) it&#x27;s &quot;in the right place&quot;.
 https://content.spiceworksstatic.com/service.community/p/post_images/0000339409/5c19c899/attached_image/filejpeg.jpg
 I also have some pure site to site vpn ipsec with others that it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot; the ISR routers.
 On the ISR routers i also want to do the NAT + IPSEC site to site vpn + Anyconnect
 Can you also please come with other ideas/opinon ? It&#x27;s a good design ? bad design ?
 the actual network right now it&#x27;s in a bad shape and that&#x27;s why i need to redesign the things.
 It&#x27;s a not a big network behind ( 200 - 300 users something like that and more of them are practically remote and connecting via the anyconnect ).
 Also there are some servers behind ( 2 vcenters with some virtual servers + storage ).
 What do you thing ?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a layer 3 switch with a handful of vlans and SVI configured. I need to configure inter-VLAN multicast routing.
 The source and receivers are in separate subnets which terminate on the layer 3 switch.
 Multicast traffic does not need to route beyond the layer 3 switch.
 Can I just: 
 enable ‘ip multicast routing’ globally and ‘ip pim dense-mode’ on the SVI’s?
 Or is it better to:
 enable a loopback on the L3 switch, configure ‘ip PIM rp-address ’
 Configure ‘ip pim sparse-mode’ on the SVI
 Configure IGMP snooping on the downstream L2 switch ports? Is this required or just preferable?
 Or are both approaches wrong? 
 I have never needed to configure mcast until now and my only experience is reading the CCNP ENCOR OCG / watching Kevin Wallace videos / googling around. 
 Would either of the above approaches work or have I missed something crucial due to inexperience?
 Thanks as always!

 I ran into a small law office the other day, their previous IT guy sold them a windows server, a fortigate firewall and a Nas for storage.
 I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around why anyone would choose this type of firewall for a small office that has 5-7 employees.
 When asked what is the purpose of the server is the owner doesn&#x27;t even know. They only use the Nas for their data but that is a discussion for another time. My concern right now is why fortigate? Is it that much better than a Sonicwall or a pfsense?

                              <span>Just completed an overhaul of a nightmare network cabinet at a lab. I can&#x27;t post before/after images here unfortunately. 
 I&#x27;ve used a 15U wall mount cabinet that houses some fans at the top, an Adva box, a Cisco box, a Draytek router, two 24 port patch panels, two 24 port Netgear switches and a PDU.
 I left a 1U gap between all the active equipment units. I mounted a 1U horizontal cable management bar between each patch panel and network switch. There&#x27;s no spare space left in the cabinet.
 I used 50cm patch cables as I read this is the minimum certified length. However, the patch cables have ended up looking messy as there&#x27;s no way to make them look neat unless I used shorter cables which I&#x27;m kinda reluctant to.
 So the question is, did I goof and should have gotten a bigger cabinet and left 2U for the patch cables or should I just go with shorter patch cables?
 Patchsave sell 10cm and 20cm ones.

                              <span>Well, after 7 years in RMF/GRC roles I have had enough and it is not the right fit (ok, I actually decided after year 1 but am just making the move now lol). I love technology and building things and think a career in networking is a better fit.
 I need to make a plan to get an entry level role in networking and need some assistance.
 ---------------------------------
 Wants:
  
I need a degree: I know WGU is nice and I can obtain CCNA shortly after. Anyone have any better recommendations? Cost is not an issue but time is, I want to finish it as fast as I can.
 I need certs: I only hold CISSP and Sec + (expired). I plan on CCNA and possibly some AWS certs (architect and dev ops associates).
 I need a job: I need to land an entry level networking role that can get me the experience needed to progress in the field.
 Future: I eventually want to progress to network engineer or network security engineer. Am not entirely sure what credentials (other than experience) I would need for this career.
  
---------------------------------
 Experience/me: 
  
I am 40 years old and retired military, am I too old? I know age discrimination is a real thing in this field.
 8 years military related IT roles in IT security. All RMF and compliance focused.
 4 of those years I did light sys admin work for classified networks. Helped design and build a few network segments and have hands on with VOIP, VTC, encryption (TACLAN) and Active Directory.
 Fluent in Linux (was studying for OSCP) and win environments. 
 Have studied for AWS certs and could prob pass the dev ops assoc. in two months time. CCNA would prob take me month or so as well.
  
---------------------------------
 So, what are your thoughts, recommendations or concerns? 
 If you have any advice or experience making a transition like this I would love to hear from you as well.
 Any ideas on how I can make this plan better or more efficient please let me know as well.
 Actually, any advice would be helpful.

                              <span>The chaotic footage from rioting in Chicago as well as the shooting of a young black man who knocked on the wrong door this week have sparked more discussion of “systemic racism”, policing and public policy.  In this episode, we talk with Manhattan Institute fellow Heather Mac Donald, bestselling author of “When Race Trumps Merit,” about how the concepts of systemic racism and “disparate impact” have shaped the nation.

 Current I guess you would call me a junior sysadmin. I support about 6 very small schools, all using windows systems. I&#x27;m pretty confident in day to day tasks with windows server, win 10, and iPad support at this point.
 In your opinion, if I were to start looking at finding a new job, would you recommend upskilling further with windows server to the point I could potentially be a sysadmin on my own for a smaller business. Start learning everything I can about Linux systems (I have literally 0 experience with Linux) or look into cloud systems such as Azure or something else? Where do you see the most opportunities being opened up?

                              <span>Hi, I’m a security guy by trade but figured you all would have the most experience to answer my question.
 I have a ton of MFA codes I use for work and I need a good iOS app that I can have a backup and is easy to switch and restore on another device.
 I already have Okta for my company stuff and Microsoft’s app for that stuff but a lot of our clients SIEMs need MFA so I have like 20+ codes I used daily.
 I initially set up Duo on my Android since IT recommended that for storing backups in Google Drive, but then I got my work equipment and they sent me an iPhone so I would like to move everything over.
 Some people recommended Airbus. What’s your recommendation? I don’t want to have to annoy engineering to reset my SIEM creds if I choose a shitty app that causes problems.

                              <span>This may be the wrong place to ask but hoping someone can help. I have a client I’m helping out who has a legacy Novar Savvy system that he inherited with the building he bought. It is connected to the network via an Ethernet cable. However I’ve been digging around and calling lots of people and finally got ahold of someone at Honeywell, and they told me point blank “ESS32 has been end of life and support for nearly 10 years. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m going to be able to get you a copy of it.”
 So I’m hoping someone here maybe has a copy of it somewhere. Any ideas? 
 Thanks in advance.

 I don&#x27;t get to or have to do it much anymore but I enjoy watching Spacesniffer scan drives that are full. Cleaning them up and scanning again. 
 Endpoint Central (previously Desktop Central) system patching is relaxing once the patches are verified not to crash everything.

                              <span>I have a project that i am setting up some new servers with security baselines using DSC instead of GPOs. That&#x27;s all good and the systems are getting configured ok.
 1) I can only assume that because these servers are domain joined the users who login carry policies from the OUs they live and that will be applied when the user logs in. Is this correct? Are there any implications if DSC configures the computer and GPO configures the user portion only?
 2) How can i configure restricted groups? Any idea? Do i need to resort to configuring the local groups explicitly instead ?? I am thinking to create a GPO with the restricted groups and try and export it as a baseline then merge is in my DSC config... Just a thought. Has anyone tried something like that?
 3) In case i need to build a standalone server with DSC security baselines only, how am i going to configure any user settings ? Is this possible ?
 3) Is there a loopback analogue in the DSC like the GPO?
 These are pretty much late night thoughts, i am going to crack on in the lab one of these days testing all these however i would like to hear from more experienced sysadmins just in case i save myself a lot of testing time!
 Thanks!

 Has anyone successfully gotten the vpn vonfigured through the client to show on the login screen for Windows?
 I can&#x27;t get this working but I know our old VPN, configured form within Windows, had it showing on the login screen which is something we need the ability to do. 
 Any advice on this front?

 Are there any good resources that can explain headers? What is the difference between ARC-Authentication-Results and Authentication-Results. Here is what I see from my sent folder

                              <span>Hey guys!
 There is likely going to be a potential opening for a new sysadmin role at my company, my manager is pushing really hard for me to get the promotion due to my previous training in Active Directory and network administration.
 However, we have a hybrid environment and while I&#x27;ve been really good at picking up on how to administer the various technologies we use (Intune, SharePoint, etc)
 Does anyone have any recommendations on certifications or recommended training?
 For background our full environment is hybrid AD/AAD with AD Connect Sync, SharePoint, Exchange, and Intune for MDM/MAM.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at MS-100-101 as our C-Suite is starting to take cyber-security pretty seriously and also AZ-800-801 as well.
 I&#x27;m also working on developing my Powershell skills.
 I&#x27;m passable at them but want to get much better at using it to make writing automation scripts and tasks easier.
 Any suggestions would be very helpful, sorry if this is posted a lot but I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the FAQ so I&#x27;d figured I&#x27;d make a post.

This is supposed to be 11:30PM well after hours. Well my friends, not noticing the key to switch it from AM by default to PM didn&#x27;t take, the entire system went down midway through their Saturday shift. There is no recovering the rest of the business day it cannot be stopped. Called the VP owned my mistake after remoting in and verifying this is exactly what happened. So how is yalls Saturday going?

 I’m reviewing my org’s toll free DIDs and none of them have been used in a year. Is there still a market for this? We don’t publish ours and our outgoing ANI is the local number.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m a CS major and have interned as a Software Engineer and Backend developer (modeling, testing and implementing DB&#x27;s) but to be honest i don&#x27;t want to develop Applications at all as a fulltime job because that doesn&#x27;t really seem fulfilling to me. I rather have a direct impact on other Developers and teams / the people around me! 
 I do enjoy programming though, especailly Python to automate things with. I&#x27;ve been reading a little about sysadmin stuff and i do know the basics of bash scripting, know how to get around, use VIM, i&#x27;ve done a Kali linux class that was pretty extensive and have my CCNA from my Networking class in school and most important i quite enjoyed learning all that. 
 What i&#x27;m wondering is, are there jobs that kind of mix these things together? Where i can automate things, develop solutions for Developers around me while still leveraging my computer science / coding skills?

 My mentor/college always frustrated at teaching me. Eventhough he never say it but i can feel his emotion.
 One day he was teaching me about print server and how to fix it. I just cant understand what is he saying.
 I always drawing smth when we have downtime. I feel tired in this field. I dont know what to do.

 We have client who is getting an error when trying to enable a new certificate template. The error is not specific to one single template but to all new certificate templates. Also, they have many actively working certificates despite this issue. When they try to enable a new certificate template, they get the following error message:
 “The template information on the CA cannot be modified at this time. This is most likely because the CA service is not running or there are replication delays. The parameter is incorrect. 0x80070057 (Win32: 87 ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER)
 The Changes can be saved to Active Directory and retrieved by the CA next time it is started. Do you want to save the changes to Active Directory?”
 They don’t want to save to AD, because the error is just wrong – the CA …</span>

                              <span>I’m stumped on this one and so is everyone in our org. The program runs fine when we launch it on workstations within our main building using a batch command that calls the program through a shared drive. However, we&#x27;re running into issues when we try to launch the program on remote hosts outside of our second building and over VPN.
 When we run the batch command in these situations, we can see active connections to the server over SMB, but the program doesn&#x27;t actually launch on the remote host. It&#x27;s as if the Java connection isn&#x27;t going over the WAN/VPN. We&#x27;ve already reached out to our network team, server team, and the vendor, but nobody has been able to provide a solution yet.
 We&#x27;ve checked our firewall settings, network settings, and DNS settings, but haven&#x27;t found any issues there. We&#x27;ve also tried running the program directly on the remote host, but that didn&#x27;t work either.
 Any ideas?

 Have any (or all) of you experienced the pain of being forced to implement a system due to poor research, lack of communication, lack of knowledge, and just not understanding the existing systems implementation by a top level manager?
 How did you deal with it? I&#x27;m so tired of having to remind people who should know better that, in this day and age (old man yells at cloud), all major businesses are IT focused. Everything that deals with communications, advertising, data processing, analytics, word processing, email, all of the business rules, are related, if not directly under, technology. The business is an IT company providing services through technology.
 If anything tech related goes south fast, money stops flowing. 
 Communications? Lost money. Email down? Lost money. Shitty business rules? Lost money. Bad system purchases? Lost money.
 When will it be common knowledge that everything in a business relies on IT, infrastructure, database management, networking, backups, yadda yadda yadda.
 To the VPs who make 3 times as much as the poor bastards being forced to make a square peg fit in a round hole, being told that &quot;well others are doing it, you just need to learn&quot;, being pulled in 15 directions because your word document emergency is more important than project progress: the business is an IT business that provides a market service. All of it. 
 Thinking of trying to integrate a sweet, shiny, and slick constant contact suite? IT
 New company policy that affects payments? Include IT
 Considering purchasing new monitors? Include IT
 Key cards? Include IT
 Entire systems? Include IT
 Reporting software? Include IT
 New building? Include IT

                              <span>Hey crew,
 I read a post on here a while back asking how one can reasonably use Power Apps to help alleviate some IT admin tasks, where one specific request was how to create new users with Power Apps. Since I was learning Power Apps development anyway, I took it upon myself to do create a &quot;User Administration&quot; app, so that HR for example could create new users and assign them to groups, without help from the IT department. I now hate Power Apps and Microsoft and my life. 
 Power Apps is clunky, tedious to develop in, and the licensing makes neither logical nor business sense when one realizes that all the &quot;good&quot; features are premium and Power Apps for Teams is the cut-rate model.
 All my bitching aside, the app is done, and I have thoroughly documented (no bullshit YouTube videos, I promise) the process of:
  
Creating an App using the free built-in connectors to MS365/Azure AD
 Realizing that these connectors won&#x27;t cut it and redoing everything with premium connectors
 Getting the app finished and ready for y&#x27;all to download
  
I hope y&#x27;all find my experience or app helpful and if you would like to try to implement something like this in production, please let me know, and I will help if I can. Thanks r/sysadmin, my favorite, commiserating subreddit!

                              <span>I am wondering if this is a familiar story.
 Few months back we had an urgent ticket come in, estates had installed some expensive new building management (BMS) kit and now needed all the sensors networked in, some in really funky locations - think underground access conduits and roof spaces. Obviously without any heads up to IT. Not a simple fix, and thus it&#x27;s one of those calls that emails start getting cc&#x27;d to directors and people are getting angry.
 So we run with it and design where we need to run new fibre, what devices we will place where, well documented and scope done, but because of the complications in this work (think drilling a couple of 6&quot; reinforced concrete walls that are both firestops and holding up a 5 story building above) we pass back the documents to estates (who have qualified surveyors) and say can you can you please manage and implement.
 That was 6 months ago and nothing happened.
 Doesn&#x27;t bother me, not my issue if project happens or not, but the underlying issue is just the expectations people have outside of IT, but never expect the same elsewhere.
 Off to make a coffee.

 I receive weekly scans from the client who uses a Tenable (Nessus) scanner and this week&#x27;s finding included a High finding on a MS server. The finding is as follows:
 ​

 ​
 My question is : 
 ​
 1- is it install enough Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (October 2020) and Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (October 2022) this finding? 
 ​
 thanks,

                              <span>I’ve interviewed for a slew of jobs here recently. All requiring about 2 years of experience in respect to skills required. I’m not too sure, but I always get this unsettled feeling that the interviewer is always looking for a individual with 5+ years and some super articulated definition of the tools and technology that you use. 
 Is this a symptom of imposter syndrome?

                              <span>Hey guys, I want to get into learning sysadmin. So, I tried installing Linux on my laptop, but with each distro I tried, the problem was the same: the brightness controls are inverted and the max brightness is too low.
 I tried many fixes for it, but they didn&#x27;t work. So I decided to install Windows Subsystem for Linux on the PC (using Ubuntu 22.04LTS).
 My question is that is this setup fine for learning basic sysadmin? (I am a college fresher with no experience in this domain at all)

                              <span>Well on the 20th, we did a migration from Exchange to 365 🫠 an awful day to do that I suppose. Walked in today (03/21) and no emails were working - program that was downloaded on users computer to automatically convert Outlook profiles didn’t work. My first ever time doing it - Office 2019 we just had to restart a few hundred computers and the program would pop up to configure the profile (not suppose to require a restart anyways) Office 2016 users we had to apply latest patch, then restart and the program would work to configure new profile. I’ve been having to tell people to use the OWA until I can get to them. Then found out that Microsoft is having 365 admin issues on top of it. I did not think it would be this hard. All this is a hit or miss operation.

                              <span>Hi everyone. Last year I got a new job as IT Specialist for an engineer company that has grown at an incredibly fast pace in recent years. The biggest problem I’m facing right now is that there is no central management for our endpoints and nobody seems to care: the general mentality in many respects has remained that of the family business.
 Since the company is constantly growing, now we have more than 250 endpoits to manage without an MDM, and most employees have the possibility to work remotely 2 days a week.
 We have mainly Windows 10-11 PCs, a couple of Macs, a dozen iPads and 70 Android phones.
 Is there a way to manage this all in some MDM with software management? 
 I looked into intune/endpoint manager since we are already using Microsoft 365 services with hybrid Azure AD join.
 I also need to deploy Autodesk apps (such as Autocad and Revit) on 40% of the Windows devices, and I was wondering if there is an MDM that is better suited for this task.
 Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>I’ve got a domain.local that needs syncing with its O365 counterpart. We have around 700 users, each user has an separate account on both domains already, with an identical username.
 My end goal is to get users logging in with a single set of credentials for their computer and o365 logins and allowing automatic login of their OneDrive and Microsoft Office programs. I already know I need to setup password write back.
 I’m looking for best practices and any guides that will help me along the journey of enabling AD sync between this on prem .local domain and our Azure AD counterpart. Of course, I’d like it to go as smoothly as possible.
 Once the domains are synchronised, how does it deal with those users who have different attributes. For example, if a local domain user is showing as in department A, and the O365 user with the same username is in department B, which department wins?

 Oh there is one more details - why can other Windows clients on the network see our old QNAP servers, despite both being in completely different subnets?
 Oh and lastly I know the Windows clients can add them via IP of course. But I&#x27;d rather not do that in-case the IP changes, as well as other reasons like making it easier for people to identify servers.
 Or is there a better way to handle this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m building a Hyper-V lab whereas there are three or more computers:
  
Microsoft Server 2019 - 192.168.5.10 (This will also be the Gateway)
 Windows 11 For Server Access - 192.168.5.20
 Windows 11 for General Client Use (here&#x27;s where &quot;or more&quot; come into play, there may be many clients, all of which should see the same user experience.) - 192.168.5.30
  
I can set up these three in Hyper-V such that they&#x27;ll ping each other, and that I can map a network drive from the Win11 Server Access PC to view the contents on C:\ of the Server 2019. I will be setting up an Internal Switch for this.
 My Client General Use Computers, lets say I wanted to block www.latimes.com (just picking a site, nothing against LA Times), how can I network my computers, such that my Client Computers won&#x27;t be able to access this website?
 The question is not, how do apply the block. I&#x27;ll get to that later.
 Which one of these PCs actually accesses the Internet for that client? Is it #1, #2 or #3? I need that process explained to me and how to network it properly, or at the very least, a link that explains it well for a beginner.
 I am comfortable using Command Prompt, even more comfortable with Powershell (preferred)

                              <span>Hey All,
 Has one one transitioned from Palo Alto to Cisco Meraki Firewalls? We’re looking at transitioning but I have hesitations. All our sites have Palo Alto devices but we don’t have panorama so no unified or cloud management features. Becomes the brand and cloud management, what are pros vs cons of migrating to Meraki?

                              <span>I have colocation hosting with a provider that I am planning on moving from in the RIPE region.
 For this example lets presume
 My AS &#x3D; AS111
 Current colo AS &#x3D; AS222
 New colo AS &#x3D; AS333
 It&#x27;s been a while I believe all I need to do is update the following from
 import: from AS222 accept ANY export: to AS222 announce AS111 
 To
 import: from AS333 accept ANY export: to AS333 announce AS111 
 Presuming I have the network side setup before making this change in the new data center how long does the change take to propagate globally? And does my previous colo provider need to do anything (such as stop trying to announce)

 We tend to dither in the 5 to 15 users but yeah, looking for best value input. I think we will continue to use Ubiquiti AP plus controller. Everything else is open for discussion
 ​
  
 nice to have POE LAN ports on Router 
 POE manage switch
 Business grade IPS, VLAN, etc
 SNMP obviously

                              <span>Hi,(in hopes that the reddit-elite can help me somehow...)
 Background: For a research project I was asked to try if one could send data with a SFP-Module - slightly disturb the optical channel - and receive whatever (corrupted) data the receiver gets.
 Intermediate goal: Receiving a single (desperated smiley...) package with corrupted data.
 Structure: VirtualBox with Ubuntu 1 → USB2Ethernet → Ethernet2SFP → SFP2Ethernet → Ethernet2USB → VirtualBox with Ubuntu 2.
 (Add1: In reality I have a breakout-board with two additional SFP-Modules in between the SFP2Ethernet-convertes to inspect the transmitted signal with an oscilloscope - but since it does nothing to the data it seems irrelevant for the question)(Add2: The SFP2Ethernet-convertes are from 10Gtek. They use the RealTek RTL8213 IC)

                              <span>We are looking for a recommendation on a pair of VPN routers to replace our out of date Cloudtrax routers between two business sites 
 Here is what we need:
  
Prefer something that&#x27;s cloud based that we can access anytime but not a deal breaker
 
Don&#x27;t want to pay annual fees if we can avoid it 
 
We have two remote sites where we back up to each other, so it needs to be able to handle constant large file transfers without crashing
 
Welcome open source solution. DD-WRT?
 
Enterprise grade
 
Reasonable cost
 
 Any recommendations?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everybody,
 I currently work for a local government outside the US with a relatively small IT department. I am currently the teammember with the longest employment with just 17 months working here. It was (and still is) a wild ride.
 We currently face the challenge, that our core-switches and a lot of our network switches are extremly old. We also have two networks (one for the city government and one for the schools of the city) with different brands of switches that run together on a single core-switch each. The core-switches are not redundant. It&#x27;s a bit of a mess.
 One network is currently running on Nortel and Extreme switches, the other one is mainly Aruba and HP. We also use Aruba for our WIFI.
 Out goal is to replace both core-switches, and make both networks run redundantly over both core-switches (still seperated via VLANs). Also, currently nearly all our routing is done by the core-switches instead of the firewall. We want to change that as well.
 We also have to replace a huge amount of our switches over the next year or two. Here we want to choose one brand for both networks, that we stick with in the future.
 Now I am not very deep into the networking side of things (yet). I am normaly more of a sysadmin. That&#x27;s why I wanted to ask you guys for some recommendations on how to approach this.
 What brands of switch-manifacturers would you recommend? What technologies should I look out for? What should I avoid?

                              <span>My understanding of SASE is that clients install an agent that tunnels up to the SASE provider’s cloud, and routes all outbound traffic via this tunnel, where it goes through the provider’s Firewall in said cloud instance, and then egresses from there. To access on-prem company resources, a light weight connector VM is dropped somewhere in the datacenter that tunnels up to the same SASE provider cloud, and acts as a proxy of sorts.
 In theory this eliminates remote access vpn full tunneling into your network.. remote users no longer get a routable IP that can be reached from on-prem, meaning they also can’t reach on-prem resources unless it’s via the “connector” and that can be locked down according to your heart’s content.. meanwhile all traffic destined outside of your network has the benefit of being secured by this cloud firewall.
 My question is, have any of you transitioned to a solution like this as a full-on replacement to traditional remote access vpn? What was your driver in doing so? (Checking a box for zero trust strategy? Eliminating the overhead of managing the remote access vpn infrastructure? (Patching appliances, renewing certificates, keeping client software version current, etc). Because a case study showed this was genuinely more secure than a traditional remote access vpn?)
 My other question os what are the shortcomings? Issues encountered, etc? I’m already thinking of an interactive app we use in our network that probably won’t work with this, since it establishes old school RTP sessions to endpoints.. so any stateful device sees two different sessions, one from endpoint, one to endpoint… I’m skeptical this will successfully traverse the “connector” proxy..
 Any other thoughts? Is this just another marketing fad and it’s really just over glorified “cloud firewall?” Or is this pretty much the future? Maybe I’m completely missing the point on what SASE actually is and why it is? I’m eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on this!

                              <span>Hello guys, lately I have been having some problems with Ip adresses that trace back to CGNAT networks. My problem is that when I block the supposedly “malicious” Ip’s, many legitimate users are also blocked. I have 2 minutes questions:
  
How are spammers and attackers in a CGNAT network traced or identified?
 
Do the Internet providers of the networks keep track of the traffic from each individual user, or just the traffic that is generated inside the CGNAT network as a whole.
 
 The ISP’s haven’t been really helpful, since most of their helpdesk employees aren’t very tech savvy. Thank you in advance :)

                              <span>Hi all! 
 I observed a strange issue in my POC and it&#x27;s been a bit of a head scratcher for me.
 This is an SDA POC deployment so do keep in mind that there might be some config out of place as we&#x27;ve bene playing with the test scenario. 
 To get a better idea of the issue I&#x27;d need to give a topology however Images are not supported in this reddit so I&#x27;ll try to do my best to explain the scenario: 
 Core network is running OSPF.
 THere are 2 Nexus 9300 acting as fusion router ( standalone) however only SDA-IPN-01 has a link up to CORE network. 
 Fusion devices SDA-IPN-01 and SDA-IPN-02 are connected via P2P link and are forming IBGP connection.
 This IS AS65002 
 On SDA-IPN-01 I&#x27;m redistributing All routes from OSPF to BGP and vice versa . Redistribution from BGP to OSPF has 2 route maps. On…</span>

                              <span>I have some sysadmins reporting to me who have worked at this place for 20 years, and they are afraid of automation and argue that it isn&#x27;t necessary and will make everything unreliable.
 Short of just firing them and starting over with new people, how would you indoctrinate them? Are there any books or other sources out there that I can use to bring these people in line with modern times? I can&#x27;t spoon feed them everything myself. They have been successfully managing their legacy systems for 20 years, but we need a change, and I would prefer to not have that change involve getting rid of them.
 These are people who have never heard of ansible or rundeck and who cut their teeth on solaris.
 I&#x27;m looking for something like &quot;automation 101&quot; that talks about new methods of doing things and the modern way to manage IT, and has a pets vs cattle discussion.

                              <span>Interviewed and received a job offer for a sysadmin position at a pretty large theme park/resort. Would be working as part of a team, primarily managing and maintaining systems in their data center, managing O365/AzureAD, assisting with escalated tickets, and I&#x27;m sure a ton more.
 I&#x27;m currently an Azure Admin for a large MSP, and have been for a little over 2 years now, this job will require me to move back into an on-premise environment and learn VMWare. I&#x27;m not opposed to this, but just not sure if it would be a step-down, and I certainly would miss Azure. Job is hybrid, 2–3 days a week in office, I&#x27;m currently fully remote. Would be a 15% percent raise.
 Have a slight obsession with theme parks/roller coasters, so I do think this would be a cool position to have, with some opportunity to assist with system and network design for ride operations + the park in general.
 Anyone ever worked IT in the amusement industry? How bad is it?

                              <span>I work for a mid-size corporation. We&#x27;re in the home stretch of implementing a new ERP system consisting of various Windows Server 2019 VMs hosted on a Windows 2019 Hyper-V cluster. The vendor &quot;requires&quot; sub-0.500ms network response times between the component servers (SQL, web front-end, etc). We&#x27;re far exceeding their IOPS specs for disk, so that&#x27;s not a concern whatsoever.
 Am I the only one that feels this network latency requirement is unrealistic? I&#x27;m currently attaining values ~0.700ms, even between VMs on different hosts. I barely get sub-0.500ms response times between 2 Cisco network switches with a 100Gb interconnect.

                              <span>Why does the view behavior change when the column order changes?
 For example, when using conversation view and have &#x27;Subject&#x27; field in the 2nd column, for every item in there the name of the subject is not repeated. However, if subject is in the 3rd column, the subject name is repeated for every item.
  
 Why does it do this and how can I make it so it doesn&#x27;t repeat for every item in the chain?
 Similarly, can I force that behavior (to not repeat) if I&#x27;m using the &#x27;Task Subject&#x27; instead of the normal Subject field?
  
 See screenshot here as an example to better explain this,

                              <span>Issue:
 Need a tool that will visualization our network by grabbing our pfsense firewall/NAT rules and generating some sort of visualization.
 I know I can pull the xml configs of the firewall/NAT rules off pfsense but trying to figure out a good tool in order to parse that and visualize it.
 Our ISSO wants to have something in order to review and see which systems have outside connections coming in to them from the internet and over what ports.
 They asked us to look into Redseal, which seems to be capable of doing this but comes with a $60k price tag to it, which is way too high for what little we need it to do.
 We do not need a SIEM, Vuln scanner, CIS/SCAP benchmark tool, SOC analytics or anything else Redseal seems to offer. 
 Anyone have any suggestions? I haven&#x27;t used python before to parse xml and visualize it into something but i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been done before or there&#x27;s something like this...somewhere lol. Just not sure where!

                              <span>Not a sysadmin, but I handle some tickets for a lot of low-level items on the business side. Usually one ticket with many low-level items, i.e. 5 low-level items, one ticket. These low-level items are essentially different workstreams that can be blocked based on another user. Essentially, there are cases where 3 low-level items are cleared, but we still have 2 remaining, so the ticket isn&#x27;t closed on our side. This causes a never-ending build-up. 
 Seeing as this sub probably deals with tickets, I wanted to see if there&#x27;s an efficient way to deal with this. I can&#x27;t play cat and mouse with the users forever, going into each ticket and firing off email reminders to clear their item, so I can clear mine. I also can&#x27;t police the users to only have 1 item per ticket, it&#x27;s not feasible.
 The only thing I can think about to combat this is to track these items at the lowest level in Excel, then automate a weekly reminder via Power Automate. Is this the right approach, something better out there?

                              <span>This is probably just a misunderstanding of mine as to how group policy works, but I can&#x27;t wrap my head why the order of precedence for group policies in our environment is the way it is. Apologies for the shit title.
 We have a group policy for MS Office that is being enforced at the domain level. There are a couple settings in there that I think are currently breaking some things, so I applied a test group policy with the opposite configurations to a test OU where I&#x27;ve placed a few computers. 
 My understanding is that the group policy should apply in the order of local -&gt; site -&gt; domain &gt; OU. So even though I have the test group policy applied at the test OU the computer resides in, when I check inheritance for the test OU, the MS Office policy is taking precedence over my test policy, even after enforcing my test policy. Office policy is like #11 in the list of precedence whereas mine is in the mid 30s. 
 The inheritance seems to have everything at domain/site above the OU policy, which is contrapositive to what I thought I knew about GP. 
 What am I missing?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 My time has finally come to post here! I am seeking advice on how I should approach the following situation:
 Recently, I was offered two separate administration positions. Unfortunately, both of them are solo admins, meaning I would be the only &quot;IT&quot; person on site. This worries me due to my limited experience..
 For some background, I am graduating with a CS degree in less than a month, and have been working at a tier 1 IT helpdesk the past two years, and I feel like I am not ready to move into this admin position because of the lack of guidance.
 I would say I have intermediate knowledge in Networking, scripting, and virtualization topics, but have very beginner level knowledge in administration.
 What should I do??
 ​
 Edit:
 If anyone has some resources for anything administration related, I would be grateful if you shared with me :)
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>For days we&#x27;ve had this issue of folder redirection breaking 10 or so minutes after users logged in. It started with one user, then two, and soon it became a large handful. Multiple engineers were baffled and threw in the towel.
 Today, I sat down and was determined to figure it out. After 4 hours of analysing event logs and intense Googling, I got it; the file server IP and hostname don&#x27;t match in DNS. 
 The previous tech managing this environment before my company took over had no idea what he was doing. Because of this, there are configurations that at best make no sense, and at worst are dangerous. In this case, the file server had a static IP that&#x27;s inside a DHCP range, so a client took over its IP causing the mismatch.
 Releasing the IP, extending the exclusion range and recreating the server&#x27;s A record fixed the issue. I know there are other ways of sorting it, but with the random exclusion ranges already present, this was the safest option.
 It&#x27;s Friday, I&#x27;ve had a long week, and this took the last bit of energy I had, but man do I feel powerful for figuring it out! 
 Just wanted to share this little victory. Have a good weekend guys.

 I’m afraid I know the answer to this but I need to ask just so I can go home for the weekend knowing I asked:
 I’m trying to Install an ARM MSI from GPO (that enough initials for everyone?). When I try to add the MSI I get “Unable to deploy package. The package does not support a Windows compatible platform.” I assume it’s because the server is an x64. I’m trying to deploy settings for some machines running Win11 on M1 Macs in Parallels, and other settings so far are ok. I figured this would be too since the GPO just points the client to the MSI on the network, and it doesn’t actually need to run on the server, but I guess it doesn’t like that it’s an ARM package.
 There’s not some magical checkbox or setting buried somewhere I’m missing to get around this, is there? The x64 version of the same installer works fine.
 Thanks.

I have a bunch of HP ProLiants going EOSL and frankly HPE support sucks. They&#x27;ve wasted so much of my team&#x27;s time with their bullshit I&#x27;m looking for alternatives.

                              <span>I have a large task of reaching out to shared mailboxes that are still on prem in the effort to get rid of on prem exchange.
 ​
 I was thinking of doing the following -
 Set up power automate flow:
 Send Email to shared mailbox &quot;hello, we are determining if this mailbox is in use or not, please response yes / no Yes(requires business justification and your name etc)
 ​
 If yes -&gt; log response in sharepoint list
 If no -&gt; log response in sharepoint list, marked for deletion etc
 ​
 ​
 Anyone ever have to do a project like this? Does my line of thinking make sense in terms of automation or is there a better method.

 Thanks

                              <span>Last weekend I bought this chair from my local staples (https://www.staples.com/tempur-pedic-mesh-back-fabric-computer-and-desk-chair-black-tp6450-blkmb/product_24401228) it felt wonder if the store compared to my old one.
 I was having some wrist pains, due to my old chairs arm rests not being in line with my desk, and my wrists being at awful angle. New chair fixed my wrist pain, but the lumbar support is awful in it. I sat in the chair, for at least 30 minutes before buying, first 3 days this week where good. However, Thursday and today my lower back is in pain. It’s not even 11AM today, and my lower back hurts already.
 I was hoping to return it, and replace it with something better. I know Herman Millers/Steelcase are expensive, but I need something that’s better supporting.
 In anyone’s experience, are those chairs worth the $$$$$? My biggest ask in another new chair are, adjustable arm rests, good lumbar support, comfortable for all day work.
 Thanks for your recommendations!

                              <span>So as I&#x27;m reading this release/heads-up from MS about them turning on MFA as the security default in our/everyone&#x27;s tenant in a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m a little concerned.
 I fully understand why they are doing it as a default - just the &quot;right&quot; security policy and takes (some) of the liability off of their plate. However, MFA will just simply not work for a lot of our staff. The bulk of our staff don&#x27;t need multifactor to just open their email. Half of them can&#x27;t even have their phones out at their desks due to client requirements nor do they have any ability to access email/system outside of the office itself.
 I&#x27;m by no means a &quot;system admin&quot; (more of a jack of all trades but master of none) but I&#x27;m the version of that in our office. I&#x27;m assuming that I can reverse this new default setting when MS flips the switch so we stay how we currently are set up - those that require remote access have MFA and those that do require remote access do not have MFA.
 Any help/direction you can provide will help settle my nerves. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>So here is the situation, We have users onboarded and are given an iPhone (using Mail app) setup with their Office365 email. 
 We want to be able to move a base list of Contacts to the user&#x27;s phone/Personal Outlook Contacts so that when users text/call it comes up with said employee&#x27;s name.
 What we do currently is during account creation we log in as the user into OWA and just import a CSV of the base list so it populates down to the iPhone when signed into the email.
 Is there a way to better automate this?

                              <span>Hoping someone can help out. We have a couple users who are basically unable to use Adobe due to it crashing every time a document is loaded. If they ARE able to get it to load, it will crash as soon as they try to use a stamp on the document (this is 80% of what they do with Adobe). 
 I&#x27;ve tried about every solution I could find on Google and nothing has worked. Wondering if anyone has ran into this issue and what you did to fix it (besides use a different PDF editor lol).

                              <span>I run a stream of the 90s Weather Channel using a software simulator. It&#x27;s been on an Intel NUC, which has shown its age and is a bit noisy when the fan is going. I figured I&#x27;d upgrade and found a fanless thin client, an HP T620, for cheap. I figured I could just set it in write mode, install the programs I needed, then disable write mode and have it get going. Only issue is that in write mode, it only exposes about 250mb of C: - not enough for OBS and storing music. 
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me find HP documentation on the T620 - everything seems to be a dead link. Is there any guide or documentation that people know of on how I can enable writes to the full 64gb storage capacity? Last time I did this, I was sysadminning a Citrix Xendesktop environment, and I used Citrix&#x27;s console to create image versions as VHDs, cracked them open in Hyper-V, made my changes, and merged them in for the thin clients to boot to the image, but this is at drastically smaller scale and scope.

                              <span>My company has around 18TB of legal hold data we&#x27;ve gathered over the years that we cannot delete yet.
 The data: * Is stored on-site on an older Netapp we want to get rid of * Consists of exported PST&#x27;s, network drive folders, and Windows PC HDD images
 The same senior people tend to get looped into multiple cases, so all of this data duplicates in half down to 9TB on disk with Netapp&#x27;s deduplication.
 We want to move the data off the Netapp and securely store it in the cloud somewhere. The data is very rarely read. I would prefer to be able to keep a copy on site, but we&#x27;d need to purchase some new storage to accommodate for that.
 Any recommendations on inexpensive hardware (not a custom build, needs ~NBD coverage) for storing this data on-site and for services to securely store this data in the cloud?

                              <span>Hey guys 
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to monitor an internal SMTP mail server 
 been trying to do this with a powershell command but its not exactly working as i like
 I was thinking maybe there&#x27;s some type of service or local agent that can install to monitor this
 I basically want to be alerted if the mail flow for a specific account is not working connected to this internal relay 
 the relay is available only internally so I can&#x27;t use an external service to monitor the specific IP and port
 Ideas?
 Thx

                              <span>Hi, has anyone actually tried an in place upgrade of PKI servers to Widows Server 2022? PKI environment is quite new build on 2019 Server Core and well tailored/designed - writing this as many people recommend migration as a good time to redesing - we good here, nothing to redesing. I know that some previous IPUs might not be the best choice but hey - we got 2023 and we are telling about an IPU from 2019 to 2022 not from 2008 to 2012. But maybe I am too optimistic - if yes please roast me.

                              <span>I have a user that will be traveling to Sri Lanka in a few weeks. Was curious if is some place she should basically not take her work laptop or cell and get a burner cell like you would going to China? Or safe enough to not worry about it? This is a first for me to handle.

 What do you think are the right conditions for someone to progress to becoming a sysadmin?
 Do you believe all the people who become sysadmins were always going to be sysadmins?

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin community!
 I&#x27;d like to share with you a project I&#x27;ve been working on, called NetAtlas C2 Server Search. It&#x27;s a Java-based utility designed to detect Command and Control (C2) servers using the Netlas API. The tool offers a simple and user-friendly CLI interface for searching C2 servers, leveraging the Netlas API to gather data and process it locally.
 ![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/Q0g0ego8SK97elJvTHN5IXLzs.svg)
 To get started, you&#x27;ll need a Netlas API key, which you can obtain from the Netlas website. Once you have your API key, you can use the c2detect command to search for servers:
 bash c2detect -t  -p  -s  [-v] 
 This project is available on GitHub, and you can find the full README file with detailed usage instructions, Docker support, and a list of supported C2 servers there.
 If you&#x27;d like to contribute or have any feedback, please feel free to create a pull request or leave a comment. I hope you find this tool helpful in your sysadmin tasks!
 Happy hunting!

                              <span>Hello,
 we have a lot of devices that are registered several times in azure with the same device/computer name.
 Basically I think that every time someone else logs onto that computers and uses office 365 with their account it&#x27;s creating a new device in Azure...
 I&#x27;m fairly sure that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to be, because it&#x27;s called &quot;device&quot; and not &quot;device/user link&quot;.
 I have found a particular device that&#x27;s 16 times in azure...
 we have more than 1300 &quot;stale devices&quot; because of this.
 Does anyone has any insight of to prevent this and/or why this is happening ?
 ​
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>If a Windows host has multiple RDP certificates. Do all get checked while connecting or only the first found?
 I have a RDP certificates deployed from an Root CA with now invalid OCSP location in the AIA. Connecting to every hosts now takes obviously more to check the invalid OCSP address. I would deploy additional valid RDP certificates, but I am unsure how it handles both certificates. If I am correct, then it won&#x27;t bother to check expired certs.
 But would it check all RDP certs if they are not expired and then of course still complain about the invalid OCSP?
 I would hope that it somehow is satisfied with one completely valid RDP cert.
 With RDP certificate I mean a certificate with enhanced key usage of value &quot;1.3.6.1.4.1.311.54.1.2&quot;

 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to run 2 different Powershell script during my Task sequence. However, during the task sequence it fails after trying to run with 1st script with the warning &quot;Powershell was not detected&quot;
 ​
 The script i located in the Scripts folder of my deployment share, so i use %SCRIPTROOT%\.ps1
 Added the Task under &quot;Postinstall&quot; after &quot;Copy Scripts&quot; with type &quot;Run Powershell script&quot;.
 Am i doing something wrong?

                              <span>The cheaper Vostro and Inspiron laptops always were a little shit, and would develop faults after a while, but the Latitude laptops were solid and unbreakable. These days, every model Dell makes seems to be a steaming pile of manure
 We were buying Vostro laptops during the shortages and we&#x27;d send so many back within a few months. Poor quality hinge connection on the lids, keyboard and trackpad issues, audio device failure (happened to at least 10 machines), camera failure, and so on. And even the ones that survived are slowly dying
 But the Latitude machines still seemed to be good. We&#x27;d never sent one back, and the only warranty claim we&#x27;d made was for a failed hard drive many years ago. Fast forward to today and I&#x27;ve now had to have two Latitude laptops repaired, one needed a motherboard replacement before I even had it deployed, and another was deployed for a week before the charger jack mysteriously stopped working
 Utterly useless and terrible quality

I&#x27;ve been looking under configuration profiles, device restrictions but can&#x27;t find where the option would be be. We don&#x27;t have access to Defender ATP on this license. Has anyone done this?

 Sure I know the technology extremely well and know our companies policies very well but just thinking about leading the calls already has the butterflies fluttering in my stomach. 
 Oh how life would be so much easier as an extrovert.
 Oh well, happy days friends!!

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Hi,
 I lately encountered an installer and software that is signed with an Apple certificate. As our windows installation does not trust the root certificate, the application is blocked by applocker.
 I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m missing something. Is this certificate supposed to be trusted on windows computers? Should I add an apple root and intermediate certs to our windows clients? Is this the new normal for application developers to sign their executables with?

                              <span>This might be the single stupidest question i might have ever asked but i do think it would be a cool idea, so i wanted all of your opinions as to why this might be a stupid idea or a (maybe/semi) good idea.
 I was thinking of setting up a locally hosted dashboard that would replace the homepage (which is just set to the company website) where there would be &quot;bookmarks&quot; that takes you to notable items within the company like: ERP login, SharePoint, Office, Homepage, etc.. limitless potential. You could ask yourself why not just have standard bookmarks, but my response to that is; this would be cooler.
 As this would be locally there is the problem that while not connected to the local infrastructure or VPN it would not necessarily work, there might be a way to throw in a failsafe somewhere that just redirects to the homepage or something, i have not thought that far yet.
 So please Tech people of reddit, is this the most idiotic idea you have heard or is it a cool/semi good idea?
 Thanks for your response

 I recently got myself hired as a Junior system engineer and i&#x27;ve honestly been getting a bit of impostor syndrome (not doing much) which made me realise I might aswell just use this time for personal growth.
 ​
 So reddit, what would you use this time for if you were in my situation, getting certs, studying something specific? I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts!

 (Currently have very-very basic Microsoft fundamental certs Az, MS, Sc, a degree and about a year of helpdesk but that&#x27;s it really)

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to discuss how we are all sharing password with others who don&#x27;t have access to the same password manager to go get it themselves. It can be in chat, email or over the phone with staff we know and maybe people we never met. Privnote.com is what I had been asked to use. Some password managers allow sharing, but the person would need to create a user.
 What are some of the super dooper secure authentication workflows you can dream up?
 For instance, I don&#x27;t know there voice so before I share, I&#x27;ll ask them what the asset tag is on the laptop to make sure there are really in front of it.

                              <span>My 10 year background has been a variety of varied roles, from customer facing service desk to application support to MSP to now internal IT.
 The company I work for under went a restructure (make a load of redundancies and play chess to fill roles that are required but no manpower exists for, leading to a massive workload for everyone).
 An infrastructure engineer was bumped up to IT Team Manager, as well as several duties that the now non-existant Director of IT and Security did as well as QA tasks.
 There is no focus at all on automation, in fact if anything, we are unautomating things due to &quot;cost saving benefit&quot; (man hours does not seem to be a concern). 
 The manager is pushing back against cloud migration (despite it being wanted by the board by a certain date). We have plenty of sy…</span>

 I always wonder how it works with the VSS black magic. I&#x27;m sure someone here can shed some light for me.
 Another example is what if I save a file to the desktop when the backup is 33% 66% and 99%
 Would any of the files be missing from the backup?

The big boy job postings usually mention containerization at scale and infrastructure as code. I can do some Docker labs on my computer but that&#x27;s about where it ends when it comes to these tools meant for high scalability. Are there any specific courses, websites with sandboxes and directions, etc. that you&#x27;d recommend for picking these up?

 I am at a smaller fiber ISP. We are trying to figure out the best way to calculate our network availability/reliability percentage for when subscribers or businesses ask.
 What scope would we use to define our availability? Entire network outages where no subscribers have access? Would we calculate for all nodes then average them?
 We have small outages all the time from fiber damage so would we count every single one of those?
 What should be included or excluded? Any thoughts would be great.

                              <span>Are we the only ones running into this? Several times, and with several different versions, we have been getting our Fortigate firewalls&#x27; virus scanning getting tripped by direct-from-Cisco IOS-XE downloads (specifically, 17.3.7, 17.6.4, and 17.6.5 for various sizes of 9800 WLCs and the 9300 switches) for &quot;W32/MalformedType.PE!dam&quot;. 
 Fortinet insists that this is damaged malware according to their website, but - having pulled it down to a VM and scanned it with several tools and run a checksum on it - is absolutely a match for what Cisco lists for SHA512 checksum and comes back clean.
 I&#x27;m expecting to need to do battle with the InfoSec dragon on Monday, and I&#x27;d like to find out if anyone else is seeing this (or has seen similar in the past). I&#x27;m expecting it&#x27;s a false positive on Fortinet&#x27;s part given nothing else has tripped on scans, but certain individuals on the InfoSec team can be somewhat stubborn, and I can&#x27;t choose who to go to on this one.

I&#x27;m really just interested in the load balancing characteristics - I don&#x27;t need VPN or that jazz.
 Any other recommendations to accomplish what i&#x27;m looking to do without any excessive licensing or needing to stand up a VM? This is just for a single site so I don&#x27;t want to bloat up my infrastructure.

 I am brand new in IT and got a job as a system admin/IT helpdesk. I am the only one so I need to wear a lot of hats. Recently we got 4 new wireless access points (Aruba ap 505) for the warehouse and I have gotten them theoretically connected to the internet. They are wired and connected to a network switch (Aruba 1930) which is being tethered off another switch. All of the access points are connected to these switches and all 11 that were already here are working perfectly and everything is connected to the same network. I can not get the new access points to connect to the Aruba virtual controller. I add the MAC addresses, a checksum error pops up for a couple seconds then goes away. At this point there are no errors showing but the AP&#x27;s stay red and don&#x27;t seem to connect to the mesh configuration.
 What do I need to do to get these to work?

                              <span>I am currently supporting an office network of about 1500 wireless clients. The hardware for this network is 100% Meraki, MX250 as the firewall, MS425 for core, MS225 for access, and mainly MR46 for wireless. (80 APs over 4 floors)
 Recently we started getting more complains about the WIFI network, and the complaints are always random:
  
It takes too long to connect
 Disconnects often
 Video meetings sometimes hang
  
​
 I will go to the user&#x27;s laptop and everything is working fine. The Meraki logs do not show much helpful information.
 ​
 I took a packet capture on my PC after working hours and I found a very high amount of multicast traffic. The capture was for 22 seconds and 63% of all packets were MDNS from other Mac devices in the network (1600 packets) and this is after working hours.
 ​
 Meraki has an option at the switch level to Enable or Disable &quot;Flood unknown multicast traffic&quot;. Currently, we have it as &quot;enabled&quot; and I am not sure what it could break if I put it in &quot;Disabled&quot;.
 ​
 Are you guys blocking multicast traffic in large WIFI deployments? What is your approach to this?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I have been given the greenlight to start the automation journey for our current organization and go from zero network automation to hero. It is a mix of brownfield for our current devices and any future deployments can be considered greenfield.
 There is a TON of resources out there on how to use all of the network automation tools/frameworks but not much information on common pitfalls and how to properly scale the network automation operation so it doesn&#x27;t blow up in your face.
 So my question to folks who have been down this journey.
  
Can you describe your current workflow?
 What does the lifecycle of provisioning a brand new device look like ?
 How do you handle network changes such as adding a new VLAN to a switch and keeping the source of truth/variables updated with this information?
 Are you constantly polling the device and comparing it to the intended state? How are you handling a mismatch from the intended vs what is on the device ?
 Are you pushing changes made in the source of truth to the device in your workflow?
 How are you handling multiple sources of truth ? 
  
I&#x27;m aware this is really dependent on the tools/skills available to the organization, hoping to get some inspiration and ideas how other orgs are doing their automation.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have two buildings around 300ft apart and have 2 separate systems that need connectivity between the buildings.
 Each of the 2 systems is provided by a different vendor. They each have provided a pre-configured router that gets installed at building A, and each have provided a pre-configured WiFi AP that gets installed at building B. Each vendor has also supplied gear for a point-to-point WiFi bridge.
 I can’t avoid having the 2 routers or the 2 WiFi AP’s due to the preconfigured nature, but is there a way I can avoid having the 2 point-to-point links and use a single point to point link instead?
 I’m thinking I would need a managed switch at each end, setup VLANs, and connect the point-to-point equipment to a trunk port on the switches.
 Open to suggestions!

                              <span>While I&#x27;m a seasoned unix and network administrator with 30 years experience, I&#x27;m not into global internetworking and I don&#x27;t really want to be, normally I don&#x27;t care what happens after the default route my ISP gives me, but I now suddenly have to and the more I read about BGP, ASNs etc, the more confused I am, so please bear with me ;)
 We are a relatively small company whose managed hoster of 15 years just terminated the contract (&quot;We no longer fit into their business model&quot;, I guess they couldn&#x27;t bullshit enough money out of us, but anyway, irrelevant...) , so now I have ended up with a bunch of IP ranges (smaller than /24, so I can&#x27;t take them with me) entered into dozens of firewalls either as ACLs or as IPSec VPN endpoints, that I now have to change, and all of which are in big enterprises where changes take weeks, if not months to push through the middle management layer.
 OK, I&#x27;ll have to go through all the pain and renumber once, but how do I prevent not to have to do it again if or when similar thing happens again? The scenario would be that when moving between hosters, I would duplicate the environment (i.e. firewalls) and then just flip the route announcements and the traffic switches within minutes and If I did everything correctly I do not have to do anything on the customer side. How realistic is this expectation?
 Do I need an ASN to fully own an IP range? In RIPE requirements (we are in the EU) it says you have to be multihomed to get one, but we are nothing yet as we haven&#x27;t picked the new hoster yet ;) Or am I doing things in the wrong order, first I have to pick a hoster and then get the range. What do I have to ask the potential hosting candidates to be sure the plan is going to work? How does one own an IP range, is it tied to a person, organization, ASN? How does one move it around between hosters?

I&#x27;ve been studying for a certificate recently but I want to listen something on networking sometimes, in a more relaxed manner in my free times, maybe while eating or driving/commuting.
 My suggestion would be Packet Pushers. Kindly waiting yours.
 Thank you!

 Is there a scanner that tell you the approximate distance to the break ? It’s a single wire break on T568A…the orange wire doesn’t make to the main panel. Replaced ends and all. 
 I’ve looked at TDR scanners but would like a recommendation of one that can give you the approximate distance of the break ?

                              <span>I know we can use cert/pki and user/pass methods to connect - but is there a way to create a whitelist of MAC addresses for our windows/macs/iphones/ipads/etc. and assign that to an NPS condition? I&#x27;d like to assign anyone WITH a known MAC address to VLAN AA and anyone withOUT a known MAC address to VLAN BB. I&#x27;ve had good success setting up Radius in the the past based off of NAS ID values - routing VLANs - etc. But for the life of me I cannot see where or how to add a list of MAC addresses to an allowlist... any guides available? Google and ChatGPT are failing me.

                              <span>We have a fleet of Dell WD19TB docks with the USB-C cable connectors and there are more than a few that the plastic casing has split (through repetitious plugging/unplugging) and won&#x27;t click back together. I just need something simple to hold them together for regular use and tiny, thick (wide) rubber bands come to mind but I can&#x27;t seem to phrase what I&#x27;m looking for quite right for the googles to assist me. Insights are appreciated.
 Edit: To clarify, we’re a single device laptop shop so staff plug and unplug several times a week as they take laptops home or bring them onsite (we’re hybrid). Ideally the solution would be somewhat aesthetically pleasing but effective.

                              <span>We are a growing healthcare company, recently expanding from 200 users to 350 users in the past couple of years. Up until now we have had a small IT department consisting of four techs who share all responsibilities, from help desk to equipment installs to device configurations to facilities work and vendor support.
 It has been increasingly difficult to manage projects and maintain our infrastructure due to how many hats we wear, the lack of staffing, and the constant interruptions of day to day issues. This has led to us experiencing a cyber attack and the loss of two of our staff due to burnout and the inability to keep up. 
 The company has managed to bounce back, but I am not seeing any signs of slowing down and we are still meagerly staffed and I can sense another implosion on the horizon. 
 But I’m getting too far ahead of myself. I guess my main question is - how do we structure our IT department as a growing company to assure we are staffed and handling issues correctly? I know we are going to need dedicated help desk staff, network technician, security officer, applications support, a manager, a sys admin, etc. - but what are the actual standards for a company from 300-500 employees? Is four IT staff enough? And what roles should they be divided into?
 I feel we are not organized and divided and staffed correctly, and since our current IT manager has zero IT knowledge, I want to see if I can gather some ideas to float up to higher management to get us the help we need before something major happens again due to lack of coverage/support and high burnout.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ll start out by noting that I&#x27;ve been in IT for 5+ years and MSP for 2+. I use a great stack of tools at work (CW, ITG, Ninja, Addigy, Splashtop, Liongard, Auvik) and would like to find alternatives for home use. 
 I use RealVNC for remote access to computers around the house. It&#x27;s free and works great.
 The two I would like to use the most at home is Auvik (network discovery, mapping, and built-in console/ssh) and ITGlue (device documention). I currently use nothing similar to Auvik and a simple Excel spreadsheet for device models, serial numbers, warranties, and similar.
 I&#x27;m considering using AssetTiger for documenting devices, but curious if there&#x27;s anything else out there that would work better. I&#x27;m ok with self hosted as well!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently employed and been keeping one eye on the market lately and casually taking interviews. I&#x27;ve been really surprised by the volume of weird behavior I&#x27;ve been seeing that I definitely didn&#x27;t run into very often before. Some examples:
 ​
  
Listing says full remote or hybrid, interviewers are obviously working from home, after the job offer is made they let you know you&#x27;ll be in the office full time alone. Maybe they couldn&#x27;t get their existing staff to come back in, but they&#x27;re hoping new staff will?
 Weird total compensation calculation. For example, total comp is 150k: base salary 50k, 100k bonus. This is mostly in the financial industry which is somewhat known for weird bonus structures but this is nuts, how are they attracting people in a high COLA that don&#x27;t have a huge res…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Tl;Dr what is your time management strategy?
 I&#x27;m a recent sysadmin supervisor after over a decade in service desk management plus a year as a sysad, and I&#x27;m struggling to juggle everything that needs to get done. I&#x27;m hoping to get some sage advice. 
 I am working for a company that had a 3-man IT department two years ago but experienced rapid growth and are now up to 15 IT folks for 200 end users. There&#x27;s a lot that needs to get done. We&#x27;re taking this place from a ma and pa shop to an enterprise-level IT environment from the ground up, and need to do it quickly due to auditing requirements. 
 I&#x27;ve been working 12+ hour days every day without a break other than rushing to the restroom, and it&#x27;s still not enough. My calendar is booked in 15 minute increments for 2-3 weeks out at all times, with more being dropped on my lap every day. My two sysads are junior-level and struggle with most items, so I have to dedicate at least an hour every day to get them in a position to tackle their responsibilities.
 I average 6 meetings a day (my team, my boss, other IT departments, project managers, and vendors), plus project work, ticket escalations, emergency vulnerabilities, and any other random stuff that pops up. I&#x27;m stressed. My team is stressed. They keep threatening to quit and so I spend my lunch break every day helping them organize and prioritize and try to make sure they have everything they need. 
 I started meeting every 2 weeks with the CTO and my boss to adjust priorities as needed, but it has only helped me to meet due dates rather than be chronically late. He says that they don&#x27;t have the budget to hire another sysad right now. 
 Finding another job isn&#x27;t an option - I tried, and after applying to nearly 100 jobs I only received two offers for 20k less than I&#x27;m making now.
 Please help me. I&#x27;m at the end of my rope here. How do you do it? What&#x27;s the secret?

The Store seems to update when apps are in-use (or at least Windows is in use), but some computers go a long time before somebody uses them, but we&#x27;d still like to go ahead and have those apps get their updates. Can this be scheduled? or controlled via a GPO? We&#x27;ve already enabled &quot;automatic updates&quot; in the store via GPO but that isn&#x27;t enough for all computers regardless of usage.

                              <span>So, I was setting up new CNAME DNS records and made a cleanup of old ones that I don&#x27;t need anymore, suddenly every record stopped resolving. What am I doing wrong?
 It looks like that (I don&#x27;t really care in showing the values)Cloudflare DNS dashboardPic of DNS propagation checker
 And my nameservers are set up correctly, pointing to the domains that Cloudflare gave me
 Did I fucked something up when deleting the records? If so, I can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s wrong.
 Sorry for asking for help, but really IDK where else to ask for something like this
 And no, I am not hosting any kind of prohibited content, it&#x27;s just CNAMEs pointing to docs of some projects of mine and for a few web apps (with API)
 EDIT: FIXED IT!!
 I had a loop in SSL redirects, like the browser requests in HTTPS to Cloudflare, Cloudflare turns into HTTP and forwards the request to my hosting, the hosting tries to force HTTPS by redirecting back to HTTPS and so the loops continues. I just had to go into SSL/TLS (on the Cloudflare panel) and change from Flexible to Full.
 This loop probably was crashing the websites that track propagation

 Turns out, he doesn&#x27;t like how I take his emails, which are usually shotgun brain dumps with a bunch of different points, questions, ect all mixed together, and split them up into individual points, and denote my responses to each point in red.
 I guess red is too aggressive of a color.
 I&#x27;m sorry. I work in an industry where clear communication is vital. I really don&#x27;t care how colors make you feel.

 I am trying to update my Windows 11 21H2 (Build 22000.1335) but I am having the infamous 0x8000ffff error while trying to install KB5025224. I would love to not need to reinstall Windows, does anyone have any clue? Thanks

 We have a user who gets this message: &quot;We cannot render a new actionable message right now. Please close an existing one in Microsoft Outlook and retry.&quot;
 When I search what an actionable message is, it shows an accept or decline type of email or mail that have those type of interactive actions. But my co-worker says she didn&#x27;t engage with any email like that, so I&#x27;m not sure where the issue lies.
 I have already tried to rebuild OST, and make a new outlook profile but the problem persists.
 Is there any way to stop this message?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Switch refresh time - boss man wants to look at Meraki since all of our wireless will be meraki soon. Guess I&#x27;m just used to managing a whole bunch of switches the old fashioned way with CLI and other 3rd party tools.
 Some say it will make my life easier. Some old hardcore guys say they would never put meraki in their org&#x27;s...
 At my age I&#x27;m kind of looking for more &quot;easy buttons&quot;. If we arent &quot;losing&quot; anything, and the proposal is the same price or a little cheaper than traditional networking, why fight it?

                              <span>We had worked out a Meraki outfitting plan, nixed at the time, and time to revisit it again. HQ+5 branches+ possibly a few satellite offices for site-to-site VPN and advanced security/firewall subscription and wi-fi. We like that once the main device is configured, plug and play the others basically, and the sub means someone else is actively maintaining some filtering in reaction to evolving threats. 
 What kind of delay can we expect when ordering Meraki these days ? 
 What other systems should we consider and why ? 
 Oh, also would like recommendations of a couple of VARs to quote/scrutinize and possibly configure

                              <span>For some background, we currently have to ADs as we are migrating. I will explain more later 
 I have a continuing issue with two users with office and using an application called Aria that work with office
 The ticket came in saying Aria had an error “command is not available” when trying to open a document. When opening office it says the license is inactive up at the top for both users. However for one of them when I had them try to sign in again they get a tpm error. (He has not been in the office so have not done any more troubleshooting with him)
 For the user who wasn’t getting tpm error here’s what I tried -removed account in school/work account setting He was then able to get into office fine. When opening up aria though he was able to open a document, then it would ask for his office email, he entered it, the it would freeze. 
 Now, I am not very familiar with Aria (though I believe this is a problem with office) but sometimes if we have a user log back in in our old domain then open Aria and then log back in our new domain Aria works. (It has to populate in the old domain). I go to do that and I get the same license issue with office(no tpm error) try removing account in school/work account setting, still doesn’t work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, removed local file in app date and the launched again. Still nothing. 
 Last couple of things -version of office is 16.016130.20394 -both users work fine and have no issues on other PCs + verified they have valid licenses. 
 I’ve asked everyone on my team, endless googling and have gotten nowhere. User is getting frustrated so this is my last shot. 
 I’m a new help desk tech so please go easy on me if I’m missing something really dumb. Thanks in advanced for any help

                              <span>Asking here because I&#x27;m hitting a wall-
 I recently deployed this Teams Device as well as a companion touch screen to one of my clients, and after a few hiccups getting the Teams/Zoom firmware working correctly and getting the touchscreen properly paired it seemed to be a pretty nice solution in their conference room.
 Unfortunately, despite my testing without issue one of their primary users is finding the camera in the bar locks up when presenting a PP via her laptop while in a meeting.
 I have not been able to reproduce it myself, and do not have easy access to get hands-on as often as I&#x27;d like to.
 Has anyone come across any issues like this with a Yealink device? When the issue occurs it necessitates a complete hard reset of the device. 
 I&#x27;m already also working with their support, but they&#x27;re China based and the time between updates is tedious.
 The firmware on both devices is latest and the Teams app has been recently updated.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Im pretty new into IT and setting up a WPA2 Enterprise WLAN in our company,
 CA, NPS is already there and working, the Certifiactes are already on the clients 
 The Problem is if i set up the WLC as a Radius Client, and try to connect to the WiFi 
 the NPS says the Access Point im connecting to is a invalid Radius Client,
 if i set up the Access Point as a Radius Client, and turn the WLC off in the NPS it works complety fine.
 ​
 The Controller is a unifi controller, i configured a nps profile with ip address and shared secret so it should work.
 ​
 Do you guys have any ideas what im doing wrong?

 Relying on procedure and sending out user communication to restart?
 Scripting a message to users and/or killing the chrome process if they do not comply?

 As per the documentation provided Here it should not display any prompts for users if I use the switch displaylevel&#x3D;false. 
 The command line is currently working as expected for users who have not yet received the latest update of M365 Apps, 
 But users who have already been updated are receiving a pop-up message that says &quot;You&#x27;re up to date! The latest version of Microsoft 365 and Office are Installed on your computer.&quot;
 Is there any way I can suppress that You&#x27;re up to date! message on the computers where latest version is already installed!!

                              <span>Good morning all,
 Not sure if this will stay up, but I wanted to ask how you guys deal with having a boss who knows absolutely nothing about IT, and yet makes all of the decisions regarding IT.
 Some background: I work for a small municipal government as 1 of 2 IT techs. We fall under the Finance dept, so the Finance Director (FD) is our boss, and fills the role of IT Director. He knows nothing about IT, and looks at every issue through &quot;cost-goggles&quot; ie. what is the cheapest option and go with that.
 He also doesn&#x27;t trust either myself or the other IT guy when we tell him information about our systems and what they need. He&#x27;s extremely micromanaging, to the point that if we change the way the weekly update email is worded, we need to have three meetings with him before we can make the change.
 This is turning more into a rant than a question, but what would you guys recommend we do? I&#x27;d love to go to the city manager and say that we need an actual IT Director, but he likely wont listen, and also tell the FD about it, which will make our lives hell. I also can&#x27;t go to HR, because the HR dept also falls under the FD.
 Any advice is much appreciated, thanks for your time, and have a wonderful Thursday!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got four physical nodes (18 cores &amp; 512GB memory in each). Total number of VMs is going to vary between 20 and 40 in the whole cluster. We haven&#x27;t fully migrated everything, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how many VMs there will be. I&#x27;ve been racking my brain for a few days trying to figure out how licensing works, and I just can&#x27;t make it make sense. Any geniuses here that can help me out?

                              <span>So OEMs use OS images they copy to laptop hard drives when they&#x27;re assembled right?
 Dell, HP, they all do this. 
 In our experience here, 1 out of 10 of these laptops has problems with that image. So in the past, what we&#x27;ve done is just take any new machines we purchase, format the drives and do a fresh install of the OS with drivers. Then give it to the user.
 However, as we&#x27;re growing, we&#x27;re starting to get users in other countries. And it&#x27;s impractical to order a laptop, (for example) from India, so it complies with export regulations. Ship it here. Format it, and ship it to the user.

                              <span>So, the company I work for wants to digitize all incoming invoices. 
 Here&#x27;s how it was done before: people would print out the invoice, check if all entries are correct, put a stamp on it, and only then would it get scanned. 
 However, now the entire printing process will be eliminated. 
 Because of this, I have been looking for some software (preferably free, of course) that would help with this task. 
 For now, I have only thought of using a PDF editor and putting a &quot;stamps&quot; on it. But maybe there are some better options, so If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them.

 What&#x27;s the best practice regarding superseded updates? Should I decline them to clean my console up? Does it make console faster?

 I ran a load of gpupdate /force, reboots on target server, changed the password expiry to instantly expire, but no password is being applied.
 ​
 the LAPS UI shows a blank password, but the expires field shows as expected. This is the same for the LAPS tab in active directory for the server, aswell as the new attributes that were added for each object

 maybe someone here can help me with our DNS configuration. I have an issue where the DNS entries for our Windows clients are incorrect. Specifically, the DNS entry is showing the IP address of the WiFi NIC of the client 90% of the time, even though the client is connected via cable. 
 The cause is likely that the clients are connecting to the network through a USB-C dock, and the WiFi connection is being established faster and therefore getting registered with DNS. But shouldn&#x27;t the DHCP or the client automatically update the entry?

 With an attachment to the HTML, unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t paying full attention and had already downloaded the html, but I never run it. Then immediately I deleted it again and then I downloaded it again but opened it in vscode and saw code that is fully obfuscated:
 var _0x297387&#x3D;[&#x27;\x77\x61\x72\x6e&#x27;,&#x27;\x33\x32\x34\x37\x35\x38\x42\x5a\x50\x52\x59\x7a&#x27;,&#x27;\x31\x38\x4d\x44\x4a\x4d\x74\x54&#x27;] ...etc..
 If I try to use https://deobfuscate.io/, I get the following: var jamire &#x3D; [&quot;warn&quot;, &quot;324758BZPRYz&quot;, &quot;18MDJMtT&quot;]; so they were probably building some webpage using this obfuscated array.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m writing it here to warn others + because I also saw this: 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/x8yb5k/is_alyce_a_legitimite_service/
 which was under this subreddit.

                              <span>Heres the scenario , small team of 4. I&#x27;m on the helpdesk working under the helpdesk lead. Above us is Admin 1 and Admin 2.
 Sysadmin 2 died at my workplace.
 So admin 1 spend a bunch of money to outsources a lot of the security, networking and other maintenance and then tries to spread his projects to me on the helpdesk.
 I really don&#x27;t want to absorb his projects without compensation and my boss knows this as I explained this to him but he tried to play it off like these projects are easy and don&#x27;t take much to do and id be getting resume material. Some of them are manageable , as I absorbed handling the security training for our ~400 staff, all aging and in need of basic security knowledge. This alone seems like something worth compensating me for. There are more projects he wants me to do which feels like work i really need to be paid more to do. It requires coordinating with the vendors, purchasing software modules (so far we needed to spend like 12k on software modules for this project....), its expanding our systems capabilities, to me it is really a big project that I basically don&#x27;t want to do. How do i navigate this fairly? Or what is to be expected here in other workplaces?
 Edit: thank you all for some perspective, my team and i have a good relationship overall. Id be very surprised if they wanted to get rid of me (especially after 1 staff member dying) so i think the best course of action is to rough it out with the project and hopefully secure a promotion in the future.

 I checked and there has been no policy changes in the global policy / or any others. 
 Bit confused as to why this happened, I have never seen it before. Does it have to do with that &quot;Follow Office Preview&quot; setting that Microsoft enabled by default?

                              <span>I have a 365 hybrid with 2026 on-prem and all mailboxes in 365.
 People leave I disable their accounts then I want to reclaim the 365 licenses and convert their mailboxes to shared.
 I&#x27;m not 100% clear on the exact process I should follow.
 I think it is:
  
&quot;set-remotemailbox &quot;user&quot; -type shared&quot; on the on-prem Exchange
 wait
 once the mailbox shows in 365 as shared remove the 365 licenses
  
But it seems the mailboxes in 365 don&#x27;t always show as shared as it&#x27;s been over an hour now and one still shows as user.
 I&#x27;m a bit confused whether I need to do any of the steps here?

 At this point we are considering if we want to do so, or look around for a good alternative.
 We use it to support clients using a download link to a customized quick support on our site, by our helpdesk and support engineers. 50ish users. Important is that its reliable and secure. Taking over control, and transfering files is most used.
 What would you suggest?

                              <span>Hi!, so, since my last post asking about GPO&#x27;s, i&#x27;ve managed to create my own test OU at my work place and created a copy of the existing firewall policy so it doesn&#x27;t affect any changes I do.
 I&#x27;ve googled every possible thing that could be added or configured to be blocking the casting to smart tvs from work domain joined laptops.
 I&#x27;ve checked what polices are inside the security settings, specifically for Wireless network (IEEE 802.3) and it is completely empty.
 I&#x27;ve tried opening the TCP and UDP ports that potentially allows Miracast to function.
 I&#x27;m still unsure if Miracast is the same thing as just &quot;Cast&quot; feature to any smart device, e.g smart tvs.
 Would love if anyone has an idea what other parts of the firewall Policy to check if it has something I can disable to allow casting?
 Thanks
 P.S* I&#x27;m new to the company with far more responsibility than my previous role and looking after the entire business on my own with not much guidance lol.

                              <span>For some reason I have inherited a server in a branch that is actually a RODC. I have uninstalled all domain services from the server but it still appears in active directory as a &quot;Read-only, GC&quot;.
 It&#x27;s ancient but it is still used as a print server so I need to somehow convert it from a domain controller to a computer and move it into my server OU.
 I could run metadata cleanup (remove selected server HOSTNAME) but will this totally disconnect it from the domain? I do have a local account but I don&#x27;t want to lose access to it if it drops off the domain network.
 Edit: looks like it hasn&#x27;t actually remove the domain services role when I uninstalled it. Attempting again.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a two part question which feels a bit silly but I&#x27;m not sure why things have been done this way.
 Microsoft Certificate Authority server has been configured but the web enrolment feature has not been added. Is there any reason why someone would not add this - a potential security risk perhaps? 
 The second question, how do I sign a custom certificate request without the web enrolment? I need a certificate with a specific dns name and also another alternative name, in the past Id create a csr and then sign it using the web enrolment 
 Because everything in my org is now hyper security paranoid I need to say whether having the web enrolment on is a risk and if it is I&#x27;ve no idea how to sign a certificate with custom names (this is all internal)
 Sorry for the clumsy question.

                              <span>I need to enable backing up of Pictures, Desktop, and My Documents folders for multiple users who have already installed OneDrive on their laptops also without enabling the file on demand feature. I tried using a GPO to silently enable, move, and sync, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work, possibly due to our use of a third-party MFA portal on 365 products. I am open to alternatives, even if they involve manually running a script on each user&#x27;s laptop. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. all users are connected to a domain , i have remote access to everyone, so other than manually clicking on one drive and enabling the sync what other ways can i get through with this task.
 Thanks in advance

 I have to setup two new Linux servers for a new web-application. One should be for production environment and one for development and testing.
 I would start to setup the development environment, because for sure I will figure out that I need additional packages during development.
 But is there a method or a tool that helps me to setup the production server later exactly same like the dev-server? I mean same packages and so on?
 What is the best practice to handle server setup stuff?

                              <span>Based on my past experience, Im leaning towards RAID 10. However, I have never implemented it with 12 drives, each with a capacity of 2TB, and I require close to 10TB of usable storage. 
 As this is a production machine with no cold spare drives, my inclination is to use 10 of the drives with RAID 10, which would provide roughly 10TB of usable storage, faster rebuild times, and the ability to tolerate the loss of 1 drive per RAID with a total loss of 2 drives. 
 Additionally, If have two spare drives available to replace any faulty ones due to only using 10 drives in the raid. Alternatively, I could opt for RAID 60, which would offer more usable space and still allow for the loss of 1 drive per RAID, but would result in slower rebuild times.
 What is peoples experience in this ?

 We have an ERP system and Users need to be able to WFH - Users &amp; Management dont want to use a whole RemoteSession / VDI. They just want the remote App like a normal App in their system. 
 They need to drag and drop Emails from Outlook, Pictures, Files in General directly into the remote App.
 Is there even a way for this to work? To drag and drop from local programs to a Remote App? :/

                              <span>I have a client with a domain controller running on Windows Server 2016. This system was initially upgraded from an old SBS server which got obviously split into a DC and an Exchange Server. While this worked, it still got us stuck with some old domain scheme (I think it’s 2012 now), some old GPOs, settings and more. After a couple of years we’ve moved them to 365 using a hybrid solution for exchange and azure adconnect syncing the computers and users. 
 We’re now planning on replacing the local physical servers as they’re pretty old and thought about taking the opportunity to replace the DC server with a fresh DC Windows Server 2023, and ditch the old exchange server (which is basically turned off for quite some time now, but not removed). This will finally give us a clean environment with a updated domain schema, no old exchange servers.
 ​
 My biggest concerns are:
  
Keeping the users, data and configurations on O365 and connect it to the new environment.
 
Connecting the rest of the current servers to the new environment.
 
We’re also using Intune so would be nice to keep that working.
 
Keeping the domain name on O365 and local DC.
 
Making the whole transition as smooth as possible.
 
 ​
 Would appreciate any tips and ideas on how to approach this project, I&#x27;m sure some of you had to go through something similar. Thanks!

                              <span>I inherited an environment with a strange Time Service configuration in the domain. Currently, there is a group policy, setting the NtpServer to 0.europe.pool.ntp.org for all clients, servers and domain controllers.
 How can I undo this setting, to have all domain members go back to sync time from the domain controller holding the PDC role?

                              <span>Hello, I am attempting to establish a VPN connection with a third party. We have exchanged relevant phase 1 and phase 2 information as well as host information. The cut sheet has no tunnel IPs but when I asked I was referred to the cut sheet. I assumed this meant that I am to use an IP in a provided /28. 
 I went ahead with the configuration, created the requisite proposal, policy, keyring, profiles (one for ikev2, one for ipsec), and transform-set. I also configured a tunnel interface and assigned an IP and the aforementioned range. That didn&#x27;t work so I tried the next, then another, and another. No luck.
 So I asked for a meeting with the third party. Expressed my concern about not having an IP address to assign to the tunnel, it was met with &quot;well your NAT IPs....&quot; and he lost me. 
 I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my ignorance or his, but I don&#x27;t know what to ask or Google at this point. I have read several configuration guides, all referencing an IP assigned to the tunnel. I opened a TAC case and reviewed my configuration with the engineer, their determination, you need an IP assigned to the tunnel. 
 My question for the group, have you ever seen a configuration like this?

 This link talks about setting this up, but I don&#x27;t see any reference to the end user experience after configuring it.

 What UI would the AD domain user use to authenticate to the VPN for the first time prior to sign-in to Windows on a laptop if they didn&#x27;t have Windows cached credentials?

                              <span>What&#x27;s up, y&#x27;all?
 We&#x27;re moving from on-prem server room to DC colo. We have a modest video distribution business with respectable storage and connectivity needs. Part of this move is scaling up, including storage, transcoding capacity and (tada) connectivity.
 We have a legacy FC network connected to a legacy SAN. The rest of the LAN runs on 1GbE. The LAN is upgraded to 25/100G.
 Our internet connectivity has been 1Gbps and we&#x27;ve been saturating it regularly. Looking to move up to 10Gbps in the colo. We average about 50TB of traffic in/out with our current firewall and connectivity. We won&#x27;t have many users on this new network, primarily receiving file-based video, processing, and sending file-based deliverables out to endpoints.
 We&#x27;re upgrading our entire networking stack with a life of at least 5 years before revisiting.
 Our new network build is:
  
Supermicro NAS with Mellanox Connectx-5 2x 100G ports
 Supermicro Top of Rack Switch with 48 x 25G SFP28 and 6 x 100G QSFP28
 Mellanox 25G x 2 cards on the transcoders, workstations, and distribution server back to the switch
  
The LAN side is pretty much done, but we&#x27;re looking for firewall options that will offer at least 10G on the LAN to come up from our core switch and 10G on the WAN to fully utilize contracted bandwidth.
 We&#x27;ve considered building out our own box, but prefer to have an appliance with commercial support.
 We&#x27;ve looked at products from these vendors:
  
FortiNet (100F)
 Ubiquiti
 Netgate
 Mikrotik
  
These vendors seem to offer solutions within our budget (medium enterprise with good feature sets). Would appreciate some firewall recommendations from these vendors, to compare with what we&#x27;ve evaluated, and any others that we may not be considering that would fit.
 Thanks!

However, we have a very strong wireless Netwerk throughout this property and I’d like to use Wi-Fi for this. I’m finding several consumer type devices that can bridge. The Wi-Fi connection over to ethernet, but I’m not seeing any Enterprise or more business class devices. The consumer devices I’m finding are more wireless repeaters with an ethernet port built-in, and I definitely don’t want any wireless repeaters on my network. Is anyone else aware of a product that can help with this?

                              <span>Network traffic security Traffic goes from the gateway to Azure Relay to the Power BI backend cluster. This traffic doesn&#x27;t traverse the public internet. All Azure internal traffic goes over the Azure backbone.
 Context: So we have an on premises DB which we are going to connect to Power BI cloud service. The connection is going to be established by placing MS on-premises data gateway app on a Windows server on our network. The on premises data gateway app will establish an outbound connection via 443 with Azure relay which further connects to Power BI cloud service. The above statement is from their doc. It is essentially mentioned that the traffic will not traverse public internet. But how could that be possible? Because Azure relay is in in an Azure region and on premises data gateway is in our DC. Wouldn’t the traffic between them go through the internet via 443? Are they mentioning that Azure internal traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet and makes use of Azure backbone? I’m really having a hard time wrapping my head around this. Can someone please explain the traffic flow in this scenario. I’ll be highly indebted to you for explaining this. I do however understand that traffic will be encrypted from gateway to Azure relay but will it be over the internet? Or how does it work. They say this traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet. But relay is in azure and gateway is in our network :(
 Below is the doc link:

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I am in the process of replacing about 30 Cisco routers that are EoL with newer routers. When I ssh to them and do a show run, some of these routers do not have IP domain-name (domain) in the config, but ssh is still working. IoS versions vary. Is there a command that disables a domain-name from having to be configured prior to generating the rsa keys using the crypto key generate rsa modulus command?

                              <span>We ordered 2x Aruba 6400 chassis like 15 months ago. One was delivered early 2022 so we have 1x Aruba 6405 V1 chassis. 
 Since receiving that chassis, Aruba has discontinued the V1 chassis and cancelled the outstanding items in our order. 
 They are suggesting we order a 6405 v2 chassis to vsf pair with the first chassis.
 Has anyone built a VSF stack of 6405 or 6410 chassis with 1x V1 chassis and 1x v2 chassis? Has anyone tried/tested ISSU with this configuration?
 I feel like this is too guinea pig of a scenario to want to put into production. Having a mix of different chassis versions in a VSF cluster seems like I&#x27;m asking to be bug-testing for the duration of this lifecycle.

 With BGP it would have been a matter of minutes to get everything up and running. However BGP is not an option for multiple reasons.
 Router is plain debian linux virtualized, can be swapped for anything else software wise, only function is outbound NAT, ipv4 only.
 First idea I had was to scrape the RIPE database for route objects and AS-SET and use those routes, with a depth limit depending on my personal opinions 🤦‍♂️ However I quickly came to discover that in some cases even thow ISP A lists B as peer it may not be the case. Thi…</span>

                              <span>Hey all, I have some older 2520G (J9299A) switches that I would like to use in less critical parts of our network. The one hold up is that the wed interface still requires Java and is totally unusable. SSH is fine, but would like the web interface to be accessible as well.
 The switches are currently running a variant of the 14.XX firmware. From what I’ve seen on the Aruba downloads site, there is a 15.XX firmware available for these switches, and it specifically lists the J9299A model as supported in the firmware notes.
 I’m trying to update the switch with this firmware via XMODEM through the console port, but that’s not working like it has on other switches.
 Is there a better way that I should be doing this? Or is there not newer firmware for these switches like I think?
 Thanks for any input!

                              <span>Anyone has done testing with 400Gbps Network Interface Card with iperf? What are the maximum bandwidth. If using Mellanox, do you go for InfiniBand or Ethernet mode? I wonder if there are some default configs in the cards that would allow you to easily test the cards?

                              <span>I applied for a mid level NE job and was informed that the next stage of the interview process was an &#x27;interactive&#x27; interview where they ask me to build up a portion of a network and then they break it and ask me to fix it. In this session, I would have access to a computer on the video call so all attendees can watch and ask questions/challenge me.
 Is this normal for this type of position, or any engineering position? I have been asked to take knowledge tests or answer hypothetical situations on how I think, but never introduced to a simulation where I would be quized.
 Just looking to see how common this is and if I should run now lol.

                              <span>Hi all. I was wondering if I could get some assistance or pointed in the right direction with configuring two sonicwall devices as I am not the most familiar with these devices.
 My network is as follows: I have a set of WAPs that go into an unmanaged switch and into a TZ350 (FW1) on X0 to reach the internet. That works just fine. The private network is currently using 192.168.150.0/24
 We are switching ISPs and there is a NSA2700 (FW2) being added as well. Currently going through X15 on this sonicwall works fine as well.
 The issue that I am having is traffic will not want to flow from one interface to another.
 Right now it is WAP -&gt; Switch -&gt; FW1 -&gt; ISP1
 And what I&#x27;m trying to do is WAP -&gt; Switch -&gt; X2 on FW1 -&gt; X3 on FW1 -&gt; x15 (DMZ) FW2 -&gt; ISP2.
 I&#x27;m running into issues with getting any sort of traffic incoming on X2 to be shot out X3. I asked this question on spiceworks, but the things that were suggested did not seem to work. And one of the responses also seemed to be generated by chatgpt.
 If I can provide any additional information that would be of assistance, please let me know.
 Regards.

                              <span>Just had a need to walk a device that supports SNMP v3 and apparently ireasoning MIB Browser can&#x27;t do that. 
 What&#x27;s a good scan/test tool for SNMP v3? 
 Very much prefer to not have a full NMS, I just want to test a device and see if it works.

                              <span>Scenario:
 I have a subnet. There is a DHCP server I have little control over. I can bring up network interfaces on hosts on this subnet. Works fine. Normal stuff.
 I would like to netboot a client from a different DHCP server. It is possible for me to specify which DHCP server to use on the client at PXE boot time?
 thanks.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 does anyone has cheap solution for remote console access for network equipement? 
 Basically I need some kind of host that will have many RS232 ports to connect to our firewalls and core switches with serial console cable.

 Is doing netmiko over console possible, and if so, could someone show me an example of how to do it? I cannot seem to find a straightforward answer on google.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am part of a big team with over 10000 network devices (switches, routers, FW etc etc). We have a lot of tools that manage polling, metrics and alerts and I am trying to find a suitable solution for us to migrate.
 My team has tried different tools that didn&#x27;t quite fit but also gave us some insight on what is important.
  
Being future-proof. High availability, scaling and good performance.
 Ability to do some chained lookups. We do some complex collections that require correlating between different OIDs.
 Ability to stream data easily to other tools.
  
LibreNMS was one of the tools i tried but it doesn&#x27;t really tick all 3 boxes.
 Prometheus+Grafana seems very interesting, but i am not sure that point 2 is possible.
 Some licence solutions we found are very expensive but also I don&#x27;t like feeling &quot;locked&quot; to a vendor.
 Zabbix seems like a very fitting solution. I didn&#x27;t like the luck of HA solution but there are ways around it.
 Any suggestion or correction on what I am trying to achieve here?
 Thank you for your time.

 I can say that I have worked places where there was DR, DR was “tested”, but it’s never truly DR- always some service here or there that pointed to an IP instead of hostname or had something similar hardcoded somewhere… static routes instead of dynamic routing.. many of these things having been band-aids/ad-how fixes but forgotten about and never revisited.

                              <span>Hi ! 
 I&#x27;m working on a new backbone, and I&#x27;m trying to understand/solve traceroute to internet.
 When packet enter on the backbone, I can see three IP by line...
 Ex:
 1 192.168.92.1 (192.168.92.1) 2.073 ms 2.681 ms 2.677 ms
 2 80.X.X.X (80.X.X.X) 14.157 ms 14.140 ms 12.365 ms
 3 toto (80.X.X.Y) 2.875 ms 3.561 tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.910 ms
 4 IXP (A.A.A.A) 9.806 ms tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.535 ms IXP (A.A.A.A) 8.044 ms 
 It seems like a loop, but I don&#x27;t know where to start the investigation.
 It&#x27;s a small backbone with OSPF as IGP. 
 ASBR1 ------- L3 Switch1 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; L3 Switch2 --------- ASBR2 
 ASBR1 and ASBR2 send default route via OSPF, so each L3 Switch has 2 default route (one is selected). 
 If you have an idea... 
 Thanks !

Right now I have Mac bypass only activated on ports that need it, so I have a problem when devices change positions. Is it common to have 801.1X and Mac bypass active on all ports? If so do you change the order of them or just leave it to default?

                              <span>Hello Guys, 
 I&#x27;m just curious as to how you filter routes in Viptela. For example, if I need to find a specific route in the vEdge cli routing table, do I only have the execute using &quot;Include&quot; or adding the correct IP and subnet? 
 Ex. It will take some time to verify whether I got a route if I attempt to to search this IP 10.1.192.1/32.
 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1/32 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 | i 10.1.192. | nomore vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1 show ip best-match-route vpn 1 ipv4 10.1.192.1 * --------------------------------------------^ syntax error: unknown argument Error executing command: CLI command error - 
 It occasionally fails too by not adding the subnet or incorrect subnet. 
 What other option do I have to determine the route that a host or IP belongs to in viptela?
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>I work for a government contractor so their IT security is naturally tighter than a typical organisation. They have to comply with government compliance etc.
 I have a server I need to deploy and it needs to make outbound SFTP connections to an IP address on the Internet. The standard response our team gets from the security team is that they do not allow servers direct access to the Internet. 
 The server will connect to one trusted IP address to download some files each day. It is secured using SFTP using a certificate for encryption and authenticates with a username and password. The firewall rule would be configured to allow SFTP from this one source internal IP address to this one public address only for SFTP only. They still think this is too risky...
 Instead what they want me to do…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a field tech for an ISP. I have a Link Sprinter that IDs switch mac/IP, cable link (10/100/1000), and checks DHCP, Gateway, and web access. 
 But I&#x27;ve misplaced it. Can&#x27;t justify dropping $450 to replace it right now. 
 Looking for a software for a windows laptop that can perform some of those same features when testing a single ethernet drop. 
 Honestly, the Link Sprinter has spoiled me, especially with the switch port ID when troubleshooting offline APs. No power? Cool switch port may have lost POE function. As long as I have solid link to a switch, I can ID which switch port the AP drop is on without toning/tracing. Saves multiple trips back/forth to IDF. 
 Any pointers?

 Mine is small in the long run but reeks of egregious incompetence.
 We have two domain controllers running DHCP, each with two interfaces. Primary DC has 10.x.x.10 and 10.x.x.20 Secondary DC has 10.x.x.11 and 10.x.x.21
 Our Meraki&#x27;s relay all DHCP discover packets to either the .20 or .21 interface, the rest of the DHCP handshake appears to go out the .10 or .11 interface.
 In this meeting that I was not invited to (I have a network engineering diploma and my CCNA) they decided to perform an audit of these latter two interfaces and decided that they weren&#x27;t in use and to disable each interface. Obviously when I get in the morning I get a flood of tick…</span>

 One of my mates is really in to Jurassic Park and would talk about the moral/ethical probs of the Hammond bringing back dinosaurs and messing with nature etc etc. 
 I shot him down and said it was actually down to the IT guy! If Hammond hadn’t employed his step son Dennis as the only IT guy then the park would not have been shut down and them all escaping. He had too much control by himself. 
 The only lesson is don’t employ family and friends and always instil multi admin with least access privs. I’d love to turn this into an actual case study for getting new business.

 It&#x27;s weird going from just basic desktop helpdesk support to having to carve out your own IT infrastructure, manage a Cisco network (with all the specialization that entails for different kinds of devices), manage multiple online platforms like SharePoint, onboarding new computers and developing a deployment system for them, deploying VoIP, setting up weird atypical networking to fit the needs of electrical engineers at your company, dealing with people not in my field who think they know more than you (and in some cases do), helping out …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been assigned the project of finding a HAM tool for overseeing all our devices for a distribution company (laptops, desktops, POD scanners, POD printers, scan guns, forklift computers, etc).
 A couple initial challenges are we use multiple MDMs and have multiple companies/locations: (for example, Company A uses AirWatch and Company B uses SOTI for transportation MDM. Company A and Company B both use Ivanti Avalanche for warehouse MDM). Our laptops and computers are currently managed on NAV (an absolute mess from what I&#x27;ve seen). Company B was recently acquired, and this is one note to resolve.
 Is it normal for Support needing to manage both separately (MDM for enrolling/updating, and a HAM for assigning, spare pool, etc)? Is there solutions that can help integrate together?
 We have a SAM tool that specialized in SaaS discovery, complexing licensing, and IT contracts, but doesn&#x27;t have a HAM function. I&#x27;m considered discovery on ServiceNow for this, but I know that system can be a bull in a china shop and may be more than we need. Also like Freshservice&#x27;s initial offerings.

                              <span>So I just got my Twitter API access notification today. We have a simple twitter feed widget on our digital signage
 At the top of the Enterprise sign up form (which is a Google Form for fuck sake) there is this statement:
  
DISCLAIMER: This is an Enterprise API tier application, which enables continued access to v1.1, v2 and additional Enterprise APIs. Pricing starts at $42,000 / Month based on usage and needs.
  
The digital signage widget only supports the v1.1 API and the basic tier only gives access to v2 as far as I can tell. 
 We also got notification from our web host that they are removing the twitter feed widget from their CMS. Apparently the quote they got from twitter to cover all of their customers would have required them to charge EACH CUSTOMER $10K PER MONTH. To display the last 10 tweets on our website. GTFO.
 Either Elon is actively trying to destroy twitter or he&#x27;s so out of touch that he thinks companies are going to pay what amounts to extortion.
 I thought the whole purpose of charging for API access was to weed out the bots. Why is he charging for low volume pull requests too?
 Here&#x27;s the enterprise form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO3bczKWO2jFHyVZJUSEGfdyfFaqt2MvmOfl_aJp0KxMqtDA/viewform

 I was referred here from r/InformationTechnology
 Is there a specific Reddit for warning people to stay away from an IT equipment vendor or at least post my experience?
 I dealt with a vendor who accepted payment for items but never shipped us the order. After requesting a refund, they gave us excuse after excuse for 3 months as to why I hadn&#x27;t received the refund. It wasn&#x27;t until after I opened a case with the Attorney General&#x27;s office of Pennsylvania that they refunded us our money. It was just over $4k they were paid for goods that were never delivered. The order was initially placed on December 6, 2022 and we didn&#x27;t receive the refund until March 6, 2023.
 I want to warn everyone to stay away from Server Tech Supply of Prospect Park, PA. They also have a location in Woodbridge, VA

 Basically this will send app notification emails like Sharepoint, Teams, etc... from a domain and address you specify, and they are sent from your actual Exchange Online instance.
 This will mean it&#x27;s an internal email and any External tagging you might have will not apply, which would also increase visibility on spoofs.
 Haven&#x27;t yet turned it on since it&#x27;s still in preview, but looks promising!

                              <span>This is a relatively minor issue, but they&#x27;re out of spec with RFC 5321 -- instead of talking to me about it, their answer is &quot;talk to your mail admin and have them fix it&quot;.
 I AM the mail admin. Changing my config would mean more spam, and less security. Can I tell management to tell the customer to go fuck themselves if they won&#x27;t even talk to me?
 EDIT:
 Their &#x27;senior infrastructure engineer&#x27; called me, and in chronological order: 
  
Ignored the diagnostic information I provided them
 
Blamed me for the problem
 
Told me to change my mail server config to accept their broken DNS (lol nope)
 
Told me to whitelist his domain (Why the fuck would I fake their DNS records on our server?)
 
When I sent the RFC Section &amp; paragraph number...
 
Told me they&#x27;re in the midst of a migration
 
Told me that they wouldn&#x27;t fix it for months, if ever
 
Said they&#x27;d solve the problem by giving our employees their own eMail addresses on their mail server for &#x27;ease of communication&#x27;.
 
 My manager gave me the ok to tell them to go fuck themselves. One less problem in my world.

 ​
 So I&#x27;ve had two seperate backup providers ask me to enable custom scripting on Sharepoint so they can get the backups rolling. Is this standard procedure now for cloud backups? Just a bit uneasy as it could cause some security implictions. 
 ​
 Any input would be appreciated, thanks!

 Take care of yourselves mentally, if you feel exhausted...take a break longer than the prescribed 2 day weekend. You&#x27;re body and mind will thank you.

Im already working as a sysadmin but i dont have any certs in my cv to “proof” my skills.

                              <span>We are currently experiencing significant difficulties with our phone system, as we are unable to hear the person on the other end of the line when a call comes in for approximately 50% of the calls. This issue persists for calls directed to the call queue as well as individual end users. Our setup utilises Microsoft Direct Routing in conjunction with Gamma.
 Despite testing the system on three separate networks, the problem remains. It also affects all devices, including Yealink, Windows, Android, and iOS, regardless of updating them to the latest Teams version.
 With our call queues operating in conference mode, we have attempted to disable this feature but to no avail. Gamma has conducted a call trace and reported that they were able to hear both sides of the conversation. We would greatly appreciate any assistance in addressing this ongoing issue. 
 It has now been a week since our phone system issues began, and we have yet to receive a concrete update or solution from Microsoft.

                              <span>I have this scenario where several &quot;scans&quot; have been done on a machine. And never found anything. However as soon as I clicked on a file and asked it to do a manual scan. It flagged it as malware.
 What concerns me is that this machine has had numerous &quot;full scans&quot; via SentinelOne. If the full scan did not find it. Then what good is it? Could there be a bunch of other malicious files on the network that the full scan is simply ignoring for some strange reason?
 I went all over the interface. We&#x27;re using the singularity version. I can&#x27;t find anything on scan settings. It just does scan then says its complete. 
 What am I missing here? I made sure the agent is running as &quot;Local System&quot;. That was default I never changed it.

                              <span>This seems like a fairly straightforward problem, unfortunately we&#x27;re having trouble coming up with a solution that doesn&#x27;t seem janky.
 Our scenario: US-east coast based company, Windows 10/11 endpoints, we have a small (6 person) satellite office in Korea.
 None of our end users have local admin permissions on their laptops, so periodically they&#x27;ll need IT assistance to install applications or install drivers (i.e. printers, etc.).
 For folks in timezones that have business hours overlapping with ours, this is a non-issue - we BOMGAR into their laptops, provide the admin credentials, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle.
 The challenge we&#x27;re trying to figure out is how to handle this where business hours don&#x27;t overlap. We can ask end users to leave their computers turned on, which allows us to BOMGAR in unattended, but per best practices, we have a GPO that locks their computer screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, so up &#x27;til now, we&#x27;ve been asking the end user for their password so we can impersonate them. I hate that we do this as it seems janky AF.
 I know we could always sign in as ourselves on their PC and install the software, but unfortunately a lot of the software we&#x27;ve seen is poorly written and has to be installed as the user account that needs to use it.
 The obvious solution is to tell the company that we need to extend our helpdesk operating hours, or we need to have folks on call to handle this type of issue. The first is a non-starter due to $$, and the second is undesirable because who wants to be on call?
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone has come up with a better solution for scenarios like this?
 If Windows had some sort of built-in impersonation functionality that could be used to login as an end user (that was properly restricted and audited), that seems like it could be a solution, but I&#x27;m not aware of anything like that existing.
 Is this something a 3rd party login manager like Okta, etc. could help us with?

 I need to change the shadow copy MaxSize setting on multible serveres/workstations (+200) - mostly Windows OS.
 I can&#x27;t find a way to do it in &quot;one&quot; step.
 It should also handle multible disks on the workstations/Serveres
 Any one have a solution?

 I need help.
 We currently experience very slow Internet speeds on one of my managed locations.
 According to the ISP it&#x27;s because we maxed out our Internet bandwidth.
 That would align with my testing.
 Here is the Problem:
 How do I find out which device is using all of the Internet bandwidth all of a sudden.
 Nether the device fleet nor the internet bandwidth changes in the last weeks.
 ​
 I am worried it might be something malicious like a data extraction.
 We are using Unifi switches but I can&#x27;t see any option in the unifi cloud to monitor device usage of the bandwidth.
 ​
 Thanks (and sorry english isn&#x27;t my first language)

                              <span>I started this week a new role in which I&#x27;ll have to decide/suggest what tools we should use. Now, I&#x27;ve seen other companies use certs as the authentication method, and obviously I like these more than asking people to write down whatever the 2FA app tells them to, everyday. One thing I don&#x27;t fully understand (and forgive me for this) is if these certs are the &quot;token&quot; of an actual VPN connection, or if these companies I&#x27;ve seen didn&#x27;t implement a real VPN solution.
 I&#x27;m looking for recommendations based on latest available technologies, good practices, and overall easiness of use.
 We are less than 99 users and everyone has their laptop/VDI administered by an MSP, so whatever tool I decide to use... it should be easy to deploy.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Like the title says, yesterday my boss (GM) asked me to allow the memory card for his deer camera on the company owned laptop he uses. I asked for the reason business reason for the exception and was told &quot;It keeps me sane&quot;. I allowed it in fear of retaliation but am going to walk that back this morning.
 Would you report this to HR, his boss or something else?
 EDIT: I setup device control with S1 a bit ago and in the initial conversation it was agreed by the owner on my recommendation that we limit devices that can be connected to company computers to business use only.

There are several times where he walks by, sees me working on something, is interested in what I am doing, and has a million questions. Many times, I have just discovered the issue I am working on or am trying something new. I am not prepared for all of his questions yet. I work with mixed company in a professional environment, so I can&#x27;t just shout out &quot;Mind your business&quot; or &quot;Hakuna your Ta-Tas.&quot; I want to be able to tell him &quot;I am not ready for your million questions as I am in the infancy stages of what I am working on.&quot; Any ideas of a code word or catch phrase he and I can use for these situations?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 we moved into a new office and would like to enhance overall our presentation vibes. Management has the idea to install Barco Clickshare, but overall it looks nice etc. however it feels massivly overpriced for what it does.
 The majority of our team members are using macs, some external guests might come in with a windows device.
 Am I nuts to seek for a cheaper yet better solution? This can not be that much of a quest, right?
 Too new of a topic for me, however if airplay wouln&#x27;t have such a crazy latency i&#x27;d rather would suggest that.
 Also we would need to use an external camera + speakers (mic) in our setup.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 We use CodeTwo and some users have complained about a double empty line of space occurring when they reply to emails between the end of their text and the signature. 
 This only happens with replies and it&#x27;s easy enough to avoid removing the extra line and ensure the text ends at the grey line, but a few users are still complaining. Is there a way to make it so Outlook doesn&#x27;t add that extra reply line?

 i currently have 10+ clients in a DMZ and want them to retrieve their time from the official Windows NTP Server. I can only get it to work by allowing UDP Port 123 access to ANY destination. It doesn&#x27;t work when I set the destination to time.windows.com only. Why is that? That&#x27;s the correct address according to microsoft.
 Can anyone enlighten me here?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am part of a big team with over 10000 network devices (switches, routers, FW etc etc). We have a lot of tools that manage polling, metrics and alerts and I am trying to find a suitable solution for us to migrate.
 My team has tried different tools that didn&#x27;t quite fit but also gave us some insight on what is important.
  
Being future-proof. High availability, scaling and good performance.
 Ability to do some chained lookups. We do some complex collections that require correlating between different OIDs.
 Ability to stream data easily to other tools.
  
LibreNMS was one of the tools i tried but it doesn&#x27;t really tick all 3 boxes.
 Prometheus+Grafana seems very interesting, but i am not sure that point 2 is possible.
 Some licence solutions we found are very expensive but also I don&#x27;t like feeling &quot;locked&quot; to a vendor.
 Zabbix seems like a very fitting solution. I didn&#x27;t like the luck of HA solution but there are ways around it.
 Any suggestion or correction on what I am trying to achieve here?
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have either nightly reboots or a group policy to kick off stale sessions, so I&#x27;m not so scared to interrupt anyone&#x27;s Latenight work when I reboot once a month on patch Tuesday I am fairly new and don&#x27;t want to become &quot;that guy&quot; ( Don&#x27;t come at me, yes I do them manually for now, but only because I have blatantly refused to work with WSUS and my IT director hasn&#x27;t seen the modern way in action yet Patching servers in a modern way with Azure Security Center - MSEndpointMgr .)
 But developers do sometimes run queries that last overnight via a local install of ssms on the remote server over RDP. 
 Can anyone think of a couple ways for them to postpose the pending reboot of the servers they are expecting to use overnight but only for a 24 hour period? A desktop icon would be sick that runs a scheduled task that skips the otherwise pending reboot. Bonus points if instead a user can instead exclude themselves from a group policy that logs off idle connections albeit for a 24 hour period.

                              <span>Hi All
 We have approx 100 laptops on 3rd party sites ( all different site owners) where the internet is managed by the customer that are blocking Windows updates from being accessible. We have asked to be whitelisted but proving a pain to get them to do.
 We dont have a WSUS server as all laptops are in AzureAD and we are headless ( no servers any more). 
 I am hence wondering if way(s) around as assume its being blocked either via proxy, wan ( domain name eg windowsupdate.microsoft.com ) being accessible. 
 Happy to consider a paid solution (subject to cost).
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi!
 We have some production servers and would like to change the backup method from push (the servers currently upload the backups it makes to an SFTP server), to PULL, so we have a remote server, which will run Truenas Core, and will pull the backups of the production server.
 This is usually done with Rsync via SSH, but the cybersecurity team is worried that if the backup server gets compromised, the ssh credentials could be used to open a remote shell in the production server.
 The backup server would be really isolated, only accessible via our corporate VPN and to the production server to grab the backups. But still, if a bad actor could get access to the corporate VPN, somehow get the credentials to the backup server, they could get the SSH keys used to do the rsync job and remote into the production server.
 Is there any way we could prevent this? maybe using other kind of software so we don&#x27;t have to open SSH access between the production and backup servers?
 The production servers are mainly linux but some windows servers aswall. Is there any way a user could be make in linux so not only the user has access to just the backups, but is not able to execute other commands?

 Hope they haven&#x27;t been shut down and it&#x27;s just unplanned maintenance.

 I have never noticed this with images, only text.
 ​
 We also use vSphere, and copy/paste there is a complete disaster (for other reasons), but even when working locally and pasting locally, it does not always work.

 What is the cause of this? Windows? Network infrastructure? Something else?

                              <span>I got asked by a colleague to present MS Entra to my bosses (small company doing consulting for IAM). I have five minutes and the company works mainly with OIM, so every listener understands IAM way better then I do. I dont like to talk about stuff that I dont understand fairly well, so I am seeking for a bit of help here to not talk rubbish.
 Im fairly new to IAM and only worked with Active Roles so far and a tiny bit on OIM synchronizing CSV-Files to the system. So my knowledge of OIM is pretty limited. Knowledge about Sailpoint is basically non existent. 
 Last year MS launched Entra which includes AAD, a CIEM-Solution, Entra Verified ID and Workload Identities. As far as im aware &quot;MS Entra Identity Governance&quot; is also a new component. 
 I would like to quickly go through the components and then focus on things Entra does way better or way worse than the the other to products.
 I would like to focus on the connection to other systems (especially On-Prem-Systems), since it looks like this could be a weakspot of MS Entra. Is there anything MS Entra (or Azure AD) cant do and why?
 Lifecycle-Management is also a topic I want to focus on. Looks to me like I am pretty limited to what MS offers out of the box. For example if I create a new Workflow for a Leaver I can put in a step, that a mail is sent to the employees manager, but not to the colleagues. 
 Is there anything else MS does greatly or badly on this topic?
 I do greatly appreciate your help girls and guys, since I am really not sure about what to focus on and where the weaknesses of each application are. According to the websites they all can do everything and do everything best.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to deploy a Windows 11 In Place Upgrade with our software deployment tool. The prep is already done, ISO extracted, batch file with all the params created. 
 When I manually execute the batch file that basically says 
 setup.exe /auto upgrade /DynamicUpdate disable /showoobe none /Telemetry disable
 it asks me for admin credentials and after entering them with 2 clicks it just does the upgrade. When I&#x27;m logged in as an admin it just shows the user access control window with Yes / No and does it. But that credential request shouldn&#x27;t come up for regular users, obviously. 
 When I execute this batch file from the deployment service however it just doesn&#x27;t do anything. The deployment script runs forever and never logs what went wrong. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I use a silent parameter or not. 
 My guess is that the problem is in the context in which the file gets executed. And I have tried all the contexts I could think of. I assume I&#x27;m missing a vital part in the logic chain here that prevents me from seeing the solution. 
 Further info: The setup.exe and files are hosted on a file share that can be read-accessed by anyone. The batch file is on the deployment repository and gets downloaded to the client PC when executing. 
 And I&#x27;ve had a similar issue with a different software deployment tool already when I wanted to put a simple shortcut on the desktop of users on a PC as an admin. It feels like that was a similar context issue back then.

                              <span>Good morning everyone.
 I hope I am not too annoying with my questions lately.
 I am having some problems with Azure Information Protection and the valid applications.
 From what I am reading, it seems to work together with data classification and data loss prevention.
 Which means, if a certain document could contain PII, It can detect this and recommend or apply a sensitivity label on that document, making sure whenever it might leave the company, that the data will be unusable for everyone outside of the company.
 It&#x27;s a defense mechanism, which extrudes outwards, into the public world.
 I&#x27;ve seen examples, where they only use 3-5 Labels with encryption and/or watermarking. This makes total sense to me, as I have worked with PII before.
 My boss now heard this and thinks, that this will solve all of our problems.
 He told me to create 5 sensitivity labels, for each personnel group of our company. From the CEO to the normal employee. Everyone should get access to documents with a certain sensitivty label, but not others.
 From what he described, he wants a protection, which goes inwards. His example shows, that the he is very wary about his employees.
 No watermarking or data classification. Just encrypt everything and make sure, that no normal employee has access to sensitive documents from his team lead or above.
 This feels wrong to me. I haven&#x27;t found any example, where Information Protection was used like this. And with that I have a thousand questions and possible outcomes in my mind, because I feel like that it won&#x27;t stay at 5 labels. In the end I might have to create a label for every project.
 I&#x27;ve seen the quote, that Information Protection are permissions, which move with the documents. But I feel like that my example is a bit &quot;extreme&quot;.
 Has anybody used this before like this? Is this a valid use for Information Protection or is there another solution?

                              <span>I&#x27;m probably just tired, however I have an iis server hosting 1 internal site, but has a few ssl certs from over the years. How can I see which certs are in play on that site and then delete the ones not in use? Is it just as simple as checking the bindings on that one site? I&#x27;ve done that and I see cert4 is bound to the 443 binding, just double want to be absolutely sure that certs 1 to 3 are not bound anywhere else. I was hoping a table or mmc view might show this, but perhaps not.

 I just can&#x27;t find what I&#x27;m after. I want to be able to hang the cables either hanging straight or hang them over a rod that sticks out.
 I&#x27;m going to order some containers for the new in bag ones. 
 Thoughts solutions suggestions welcomed

                              <span>We are a company of almost 50. We have had 15+ employee&#x27;s personal cell phones contacted by a spam number claiming to be the CEO in 1 hour. One employee&#x27;s parent was even contacted &amp; they can&#x27;t think of any place they have their parents&#x27; number (not as an emg contact, beneficiary l, life insurance etc... I first, immediately thought of a breach with Paychex or Bamboo or even LinkedIn, but I&#x27;m not sure... especially because the employee is sure her family member&#x27;s number isn&#x27;t listed anywhere. The fact that the employee&#x27;s parent got a text is really throwing a wrench in this. We&#x27;ve had employees get texts from our &quot;ceo&quot; asking for gift cards, but this isn&#x27;t that. I&#x27;m inclined to think... find where the family member&#x27;s number is listed &amp; find the possible link, but idk... nothing is standing out. The employee said she doesn&#x27;t have her family member&#x27;s number listed on anything work related. This is so scary. Any ideas? Our anti-virus isn&#x27;t picking anything up. Our server &amp; emails are fine I&#x27;m perplexed with the personal cell numbers. Help!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I’ve been in my current role as an IT Technician for the last two years. Although my title doesn’t match what I actually do. My experience in IT is mostly call center and level 1 and 2 troubleshooting but with my current role I’ve been working more with networking and server issues. 
 I want to learn more about how our servers work, how the networking switches are configured and everything else I can learn. The issue is that I don’t know how to figure it all out and my boss doesn’t want to teach me unless it’s relevant at the time. The problem is I’m two years in and I don’t feel like I know enough. Also my boss doesn’t make himself available so when there’s problems I’m left scrambling for answers. 
 Any advice? 
 TLDR: want to learn as much as I can about our IT infrastructure but boss will not help.

                              <span>Hello, I was recently informed my company would like me to store and set up the company&#x27;s firewall at my home in order to make it seem like my home internet is coming from the office. I currently connect through a VPN so I dont need it. 
 Many on the IT team seem excited to have these at their home, but my main question is doesn&#x27;t all my internet traffic on my router then go through the company&#x27;s firewall? This would be a stand alone device that hooks into my router, but that seems super sketchy to have a company device like that always monitoring my network traffic.

I ended up getting hired and things were great at first. Nice pace where i could learn new technologies but now I feel like i made a mistake as all I get when asking questions is a forwarded email and I&#x27;m supposed to know to just contact someone else to figure it out. I ask detailed questions and get sent one sentence replies to google some phrase as if I know or understand any context as to why that would be the issue. Is this standard in the industry where I&#x27;m just on my own to try and figure out things

                              <span>Today i gave control over the entire IT to an MSP, because im leaving the company and there‘s no one left, which could take over my tasks. I was a single sysadmin/tech at that company. So my boss choose an MSP and today i did gave him my documentation and a training session. Job done. 
 However, what i saw truly blew my mind. Here are a few things, which made me believe i‘m in the wrong movie.
 1) Gave him access to one 1Password Vault. He didn‘t know what it is (fine, not everyone can know everything) and he said how insecure this is. I asked him, why he came to this conclusion when he didn‘t read the whitepaper and what tool he would choose. Answer: My laptop uses bitlocker, that‘s why i store everything in excel. I asked him what he would do if his devices getting compromised? As long as his device is powered on bitlocker doesn‘t help. Well, if i get compromised it‘s over anyway, a password manager wouldn‘t help. 
 2) he doesn‘t deactivate or remove the local admin account, because he‘s the only one who knows the password anyway.
 3) he couldn‘t tell the difference between MB and GB/TB.
 4) he has no clue about linux and has no employee who does and still manages linux machines.
 I needed to vent, cause i always was thinking i‘m still not good enough for a sole sysadmin role to get a job at another company (i did, but struggled long time to do this step) and did know more than a MSP boss with 100s of clients…

 The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a nationwide ground stop for Southwest Airlines flights, citing “equipment issues.”
 “Southwest Airlines requested the FAA pause the airline’s departures,” the agency told CNN in a statement.
 Southwest Airlines reported technology issues Tuesday morning and said it would “hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible.” c
 The flight tracking website FlightAware said nearly 800 of the airline’s flights – about 14 percent of its schedule – were delayed Tuesday, far ahead of any US carrier.
 Southwest called the problem “intermittent technology issues” in a social media post to customers. Several have taken to social media to complain about delayed flights
 “We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we’re hoping to get everyone going ASAP,” the airline wrote in another social media post.
 CNN has reached out to Southwest and the Federal Aviation Administration for further comment.

                              <span>Last year, my boss left for another company and I put my name forward to replace him because it seemed like a great opportunity to jump ahead at a growing org. 
 There are two other people on my team who I really like and I feel I’ve stepped up into a leadership role for them pretty well. 
 The problem is I don’t stop worrying about crashes, incidents and meltdowns any time I’m not online. 
 It came to a head this week when I canceled a vacation to Morocco because I didn’t want to risk being offline. 
 I’m guessing this promotion was a mistake? Any way to salvage this?

                              <span>I would like to take a minute and just say thank you to all the universities out there that put together in-depth wikis and make them available to the public. So many times my troubleshooting and research have led me to a university wiki page. Usually these pages are straightforward, easy to read, and well put together. Most of the time listing exactly what needs to be done or tweaked, down to the last registry key.
 Again, thank you. I know what a pain it is to put these together. Your hard work does not go unnoticed and is much appreciated!

                              <span>So, we have these stupid new consistent email signatures that had to be implemented. Deployed them all to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Signatures... all good. Then last night during patch Tuesday, Microsoft implements new roaming signatures and such, completely changing the look and feel of the signature settings (so our screenshot documented instructions are no longer valid), but most everyone&#x27;s signature is moved to &quot;Signatures on this Device&quot;, not &quot;Personal Signatures&quot;, and as Signatures on this Device, cannot be set as the default signature to apply to new messages! Not only that, but there&#x27;s not a simple copy button to move it to Personal Signatures. (yes, you can copy and paste the text, go to Personal and hit New, give it a name and paste in the designer box, but we&#x27;re talking about elderly employees that it took 5 pages of instructions to just to implement the signatures in the first place.

I know AzureAD allows you to federate the domain in an “all or nothing” method. I am interested in redirecting to others based on membership/testing. Would ADFS make that easier?

                              <span>Almost a month ago I was laid off, and without work for the first time in 15 years. I got depressed and it seemed like no one was hiring. I submitted over 200 applications and resumes and that first week or two all I got were rejection letters. I worked on my resume and cover letter and finally had 6 interviews last week. I ended up with 2 job offers so far, but what really got me was the way the manager of one of the companies went about it. He went back to his boss and asked for 15% more than the top end of the posted salary range because &quot;We need this guy, and we need to be competitive in the market to get him&quot; (his exact words). I ended up taking a ~20% pay cut from where I was before the layoff, but I think I found a place that wants me. 
 It was really nice to feel like the pretty girl at the dance for once. Keep it up, there is a job out there that really wants every one of us, I was just lucky to find one when I needed it the most.

 Computers, and GPUs in particular, are getting faster (looking at you ChatGPT). This table outlines the time it takes a computer to brute force your password, and isn’t indicative of how fast a hacker can break your password (especially if they phished you). It’s a good visual to show people why better passwords can lead to better cybersecurity - but ultimately it’s just one of many tools we can use to talk about protecting ourselves online!

                              <span>I registered a 3 letter .help domain at NameCheap around the time the novelty .help and .support domains were first intoduced (can’t remember exactly) and I was charged by namecheap approx $33 USD for the registration for the year up until now. 
 I get an auto renewal reminder email this AM saying my domain is set to auto renew in May for $1200 USD for the year!
 I opened up a support chat with NameCheap and they indicate the registry for .help now considers my domain to be classified as premium. 
 Wtf is this? There was no warning or indication of a price increase, a literal arbitrary cost increase based on an existing registered domain, and classifying it as premium after the fact is flat out extortion. 
 I’m considering transferring the domain away from NameCheap to another registrar. I’m looking for advice to see if anyone knows of any .help registrars that offer a free or low cost transfer option, and hopefully a reasonable renewal rate. 
 I see hover has .help support but their renewal rate is approx $1000 after the first year. I don’t know what PorkBun offers. Neither of these places I have an account for. 
 Has this happened to you before?
 Would it be worth bringing this up to ICANN?
 Would love to know your thoughts.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of posts over the years from computer techs who absolutely cringe at the idea of working on home computers, and I&#x27;m curious why.
 I work on home and small business computers. In a medium metro area I bill $140 for a home visit up to 1.5 hours, then $80/hour. Since many calls end up being &quot;install a printer,&quot; or &quot;get rid of my pop-ups&quot; some of those calls end up taking 20-45 minutes, and I can sometimes finish 5-7 calls in a 8 hour day.
 Have additional problems? Book an additional appointment. 
 I&#x27;ve been doing this for about 19 years with VERY few major issues, and I find the stress to be incredibly low in my residential work.
 When it comes to income, if I maintain just 4 residential appointments each day for 45 weeks a year, income would be $126,000, again, with minimal stress (although admittedly more car wear &amp; tear).
 When you are competing with the big box stores, you really don&#x27;t have competition. 
 Why the hate on residential?

                              <span>I see that this was made available as an optional feature several years ago and still requires you to manually enable it for your domain today.
 It lets you use a PowerShell command to set the membertimetolive attribute when you add a member to a group so the accounts automatically lose access to the group after a set length of time.
 Is this really useful? It seems impractical because I don’t see any parameter you can set to schedule a future start time. For instance giving a user membership to a group during a future change window.
 You would need to use a scheduled task running as an account with privileges to add users to groups and scheduling it to run the command at the future date and time. If you are messing with scheduled tasks anyway, you can do almost the same thing already without activating this optional feature. Just run two tasks. One to add the membership and another to remove the membership,

                              <span>Good day!
 May I ask for some help and recommendations, to setup Windows Defender? Especially for Mail attachments.
 Some Background. Currently we are switching from Forti Endpoint Security to Windows Defender for Business.
 I&#x27;ve checked all common options in Intune and checked out the windows defender playground and demo files. Everything gets detected from my tests.
 Regarding Internet Security I feel somewhat safe now.
 Though, I have problems in detecting email attachment. Several times per week I receive notifications from my forti ems server, about newly found malware in mail attachments. We receive a high amount of fake invoices, voice messages or other stuff, hidden in html files. Typical javascript stuff, phishing. 
 For me this is obvious. Invoices shoulnd&#x27;t arrive in html format.
 And yet, people who are already using the windows defender ask me regularly &quot;Is this spam?&quot;
 Stuff like &quot;Customer Invoice LIQUIDATION CENTER LTD.html&quot; faking a identical clone of the microsoft authentication. Forti was able to detect these kinds of attacks, but not the defender.
 We have also setup a Office 365 Anti-Phishing Policy. But I feel like it&#x27;s not working as it should, or it only applies to mails, but doesn&#x27;t apply on attachments?
 What am I doing wrong? Why isn&#x27;t stuff like this getting detected?

                              <span>I want to preface this by saying that even though I use the word &quot;we&quot; extensively, I have only been employed here about 2 weeks. Our IT department is me and my boss. My position was newly created. So &#x27;we&#x27;, really means &#x27;boss&#x27;.
 Also, links to a place where I can read more about this subject is appreciated.
 ​
 We run about a 100 android tablets through MaaS360 and android enterprise. When we first started doing this, we used a single gmail account to set up all the devices. However when we got to about 30 devices or so, it started dropping devices. So we created a second account. Same problem, but it was around 20 devices this time. So on so forth, now we have several gmail accounts managing our devices. I cannot find anything online that indicates a limit. MaaS360 doesn&#x27;t have a limit in our range I know. 
 Now I did see that there is a limit to 10 devices per user in MaaS360. One possibility is that we would set up devices for different users, but my supervisor would set up test devices under her name. This would then cause registration issues for subsequent devices. This only sort of makes sense though, because I can&#x27;t see her setting up 10+ devices for herself. I also think it was dropping other users devices, not her devices. 
 I feel the need to include timeframe here as well, in case things changed. We started this process about 5 or 6 years ago and slowly ran into issues. 
 ​
 Anything you can help me with this is welcome. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, I am aware that this is a bad practice, but I just noticed that one of my customers (active directory environment) has the habit to log as Administrator on every workstation to accomplish tasks like: Windows updates, installing software, ... 
 I think that there is a security issue here, since Administrator credentials will be cached on workstations.
 I wondering if the same risk will happens if that admin uses RDP to access machines remotely? 
 If a workstation is suddenly rebooted, cached credentials will be gone, correct, or will they still be there?
 Thank you for your suggestions

                              <span>Hi All,
 Having a weird one, I have just stood up a new DHCP server. Previously the DC handled the DHCP.
 In the Event viewer, I am getting the following errors
 PTR record registration for IPv4 address [[192.168.130.111]] and FQDN ******.******.local failed with error 9005 (DNS operation refused.)
 PTR record registration for IPv4 address [[192.168.132.87]] and FQDN *******.*******.local failed with error 10051 (A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network.)
 I have created the user dns_update and added them to the dnsproxyupdate group and use these credentials within the DCHP server, but the errors remain.
 Anyone else had this? If so, how did you resolve it?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Has anyone run up against this issue with the April MS patches?: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview#legacy-laps-interop-issues-with-the-april-11-2023-update
 My environment leverages Group Policy to install the LAPSx64.msi (I&#x27;m assuming this installer encompasses the client-side extensions mentioned in the article above). We have a number of OSs that miss the coverage window on the new Windows LAPS coverage, and so we will continue using the legacy LAPS solution for the time being. 
 Can someone check my logic?:
  
Installing the 04/2023 MS Updates on devices that currently have legacy LAPS installed will continue to operate normally.
 New devices that receive the 04/2023 MS Updates (baked into an image, installed via task sequence on deployment, etc.) and THEN receive the LAPS CSE msi will then break
 THEREFORE: As long as LAPS CSE is installed before 04/2023 update, legacy-mode LAPS should work fine. (?)

                              <span>Good morning Reddit,
 Don&#x27;t you love it when you&#x27;re the top level admin for your organization and you&#x27;re forced to open support tickets with software companies and get stuck with level 1 support for months on the same issue with every &quot;solution&quot; that they give you more useless than the last?
 Hey on a side note, if anyone is thinking about using LastPass for idp/SSO and MFA, my recommendation is fuck no.
 If I could go back in time I would rip up the contract and lay a duo product sheet in front of my boss.
 Anyways that&#x27;s all, have a great work day everyone.

 The company i work for wants to go full Microsoft Azure / Microsoft 365 and is heading towards Exchange Online / Sharepoint / MS Teams as main Callcenter and so on...
 I already talked to a GDPR lawyer because of it Microsoft not being compliant. She says its not and even if we are doing everything we can to ensure it, its still not compliant enough or even close because of some rules and some microsoft contract stuff. 
 How are other sysadmins handling this topic in europe? I know that the authorities dont really look into the whole MS Azure thing in germany, but we want to be fully compliant!
 If this is the wrong sub just tell me ;)

                              <span>Hey everyone, wondering if anyone has any ideas or has seen this.
 Its driving me crazy!
 Cannot seem to find anything in google that has been helpful.
 The fingerprint sensor is constantly trying to scan for a fingerprint when nothing is touching it.
 The impact of this is it keeps the windows lock screen active and monitors never turn off etc.
 Just keeps flashing your device is having trouble recognizing you, please try again, constantly.
 ​
 If you touch it, it logs in correctly.
 Device:Asus ROG Flow X13 GV301QE
 Fingerprint device: ELAN WBF Fingerprint sensor - asus driver version is 3.5.12201.11202
 Windows 11 with latest updates
 Troubleshooting: 
 Tried newer drivers, older drivers, specifically listed driver from Asus, no difference.
 Many restarts.
 Nothing specific I can find in event viewer
 ​
 For now I have deleted my fingerprint so its not happening and monitors will turn off etc.

                              <span>Hi guys. If you&#x27;re using it, how do you feel about Microsoft&#x27;s Defender for Endpoint as the only endpoint protection app for your users? In my case, there are about 250 pcs that have Bitdefender Gravityzone installed, with the patch management add-on. But we also recently got licenses for MDE P1 from the main hq (no idea why, maybe it&#x27;s a global requirement but nobody notified us...), enough to cover all those pcs. The question is, should we drop Bitdefender and stick cu MDE only, or keep it like it is?

                              <span>Hello. We have 2 domain controllers at one of our sites that&#x27;s running up replication errors. I&#x27;m not sure where to start with it so I&#x27;m in need of some advice. Firstly, running the command:
 get-addomain generated an error &#x27;server instance not found on the given port&#x27;
 Running the repadmin /replsummary show command generates an error of &#x27;repadmin can&#x27;t connect to a home server. Error: An LDAP lookup operation failed with the following error: LDAP Error 81: Server down&#x27;. 
 Running the repadmin /replsum command shows the following:
 Destination DSA: DC1
 Largest Delta: &gt;60 days
 fails/total%%: 10/10 
 error:  The target principal name is incorrect 
 Finally, running the repadmin /showrepl command shows error KCC could not add this REPLICA LINK due to error. 
 The DCs at the site don&#x27;t hold any FSMO roles so that should things a bit easier. For the replica link issue, I&#x27;ve come across a potential fix that says to delete then recreate the account. For the other issues I&#x27;m not sure what the best approach to take is.
 For the target principal name error, will this fix likely work? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/replication-error-2146893022
 Is it better just to create 2 new DCs for the site?

                              <span>We are currently starting to roll out MFA with Azure AD for end-users globally. Usually, we offer the options MS Authenticator on company iPhones or any authenticator app on personal phones. Only a few exceptions so far requested and/or got a hardware TOTP token (by Token2), but it&#x27;s hard to manage for our sites without IT staff and with Microsoft&#x27;s requirement for Global Admin rights for setting them up currently.
 In China we don&#x27;t have a lot of company phones, but a lot of personal Huawei devices without Google services. Any authenticator/TOTP app I suggested is not available in Huawei App Gallery for China and the manual installation of apk files is also not a real option.
 Is there anybody out there who is able to suggest an app which is available in Chinese app stores, especially for Huawei?

                              <span>I&#x27;m reaching out for some advice, input, or just a general plan on how to deal with a challenging situation I&#x27;m currently facing at work. I work in a company where I am responsible for procuring everything but laptops (phones, chargers, monitors, docking stations, printer maintenance services, VESA mounts, laptop bags, headsets, mice, and keyboards).
 To make things even more complicated, I have to categorize each item properly in SAP so management approves these purchases, attaching the &#x27;price offer&#x27; which is often just a screenshot of a price on a website. After that, I have to &#x27;goods movement&#x27; them into SAP, attaching the invoice or proof of work.
 This process is causing me a lot of trouble since finance is constantly telling me that the material group, G/L account, or cost center is incorrect, which forces me to recategorize or start the process over. Unfortunately, my colleague already quit due to the frustration, and my boss has not delivered on promised changes to the process. As a result, I&#x27;m left alone to handle this mess together with all the IT work.
 This situation is taking up hours of my time daily, and I&#x27;m struggling to find a solution. My boss insists that we have to perform these activities and prioritize them, likely because his IT Director reports directly under a Finance director. Procurement says we have to open the Purchase Requisitions, as they can&#x27;t transform them into Purchase orders themselves due to conflict of interest and policy concerns (although I doubt the legitimacy of this claim).
 I didn&#x27;t want to vent, but I&#x27;m genuinely seeking advice and input from the r/sysadmin community. If any of you have faced similar issues or have any tips, suggestions, or a plan to tackle this problem, please share your thoughts. I&#x27;m eager to find a way to streamline this process or at least make it more manageable.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 One of our customers using Sharepoint uses Onedrive to sync the libraries to their desktop PC&#x27;s. Recently we have completely changed the structure of their Sharepoint site, renamed several Libraries and changed A LOT of rights.
 The problem I am now facing, is that users that now lost their permissions to certain libraries or libraries that had their name changed/got removed, will still see the folders on their respective PC&#x27;s. The folders are no longer synced, but they are still present on the systems including files. Every user may even face this on multiple pc&#x27;s as they work on multiple systems (flex). As you know, this may differ for every user aswell, because they all have different rights.
 Question is, do you know any way to automatically remove libraries that are no longer synced?
 The systems are managed through Intune and are all Azure AD joined. I haven&#x27;t been able to solve this braincracker yet and our support desk has been called many many times by customers seeing &#x27;the wrong folders&#x27; or people editting files locally, because they are not synced anymore.
 Thanks.

                              <span>We have deployed a new version of a CRM however on around 10% of machines it won&#x27;t run under the user&#x27;s standard user profile.
 It works when installed as Administrator or RunAsAdministrator.
 The developer is working to resolve the problem but ideally, I&#x27;d like a short-term fix as they didn&#x27;t come across this problem during testing so don&#x27;t currently have time for a fix - is there a way to run only this application on the affected computers with admin privileges? 
 We use LAPS to manage the local administrative account Thanks,

                              <span>So I currently work for an ISP where I run a lot of the day to day frontline staff, mainly Tech Support. The issue right now is a lot of people are jumping ship due to poor management. As more and more people leave, I find myself taking on more work to keep things stable at the company. I thought this added responsibility would befit a raise to which my boss agreed, but I was offered roughly a dollar more (I’m salary). 
 The other part of this is that I was told that I was on track to becoming a VP , but that position was given to an outside hire whom I had to train. So I’m at a point where I feel like I am going nowhere in the company. 
 I was given a new job opportunity at a more mom &amp; pop IT group. While things are definitely going south at my current company, I can’t help but be nervous that maybe I am jumping the gun. 
 The new employer has promised to match my pay, but I am losing earned PTO and my cell phone bill being paid each month. Should I take the position at the mom and pop place ? Whom offered medical benefits , but at a 50% employer paid rate. Or stay at the company that keeps telling me to stay in my lane every time I try to give help where it’s needed? They have no medical benefits at this time. I’m mostly worried about taking a small financial cut and no PTO to get out of a poorly managed company.

 Even now, it&#x27;s not actually apparent that we&#x27;re going to be charged that much, unless we go through and calculate rates and usage ourselves. It&#x27;s just insane.
 How do people actually deal with this business risk? This was a single developer writing a single query to create what they thought was a custom metric, that turned out to be a custom metric per unique URL.

                              <span>I am working on setting up a network for a 6 story building. I am thinking of one beefy L3 Switch + 6 simpler L2 Switches. I am trying to find a cost effective (refurbished) L3 switch that supports 10gbit (SFP+). 
 I found two seemingly good deals: - HPE 5800AF-48G for around 300 $ - HPE 5130-48G-4SFP+ for around 250 $
 Both have enough 10g SFP+ which are important to me. The amount of ports are overkill for my scenario but I could not find a good L3 10g switch for less honestly. 
 I only need 8 ports in the distribution layer switch. NAS(10g), NVR, Internet Router(1g), 6 x access switches (Wifi AP, IPCAM, etc.)
 What would you recommend?

 Hello all.
 I&#x27;m very new to using Ansible, and i&#x27;m following a course where his output is gathering Cisco IP information. It&#x27;s returning IP information for him, but i&#x27;m getting very different output so i&#x27;m thinking Ansible changed the way this ansible_facts works, but I don&#x27;t fully understand the documentation to fix this. Below is my sample playbook. Any help would be appreciated. For now, off to google some more...

                              <span>Long story short, got a call from a new client who has their internet drop out every 2 hours at the top of the hour.
 More Detail:
 Client has a 100Mb circuit, and for the past few weeks, their connection dies every 2 hours at the top of the hour for a couple minutes, then comes back up. Pings during those outages show connection to their sonicwall, gets to the gateway, and then dies out from there. At&amp;t tech says that their connection is just getting over saturated with standard traffic, ran a pcap from their end, and no signs of DDos or anything irregular.
 I ran wireshark from a client machine and saw nothing out of the ordinary other than packets trying to resend during the outages, sonicwall logs show nothing, and during one of the windows when it always dies, I unplugged their network from the at&amp;t circuit, plugged directly into it, and had no issues during that window. Next step is to setup a netflow monitor to PRTG and see what that shows, but just figured I&#x27;d bounce the issue on here to get any suggestions. Gut feeling (for whatever that&#x27;s worth) is that it&#x27;s an issue on the circuit that I&#x27;ll have to convince the isp about. According to the client, nothing has changed inside the network before this started, and the 5 minute windows every 2 hours make it a challenge to test theories and chasing down rabbit holes.

Searches on Mouser, digikey, etc. are all not really helping. I would appreciate anyone who can point to the exact model needed.
 I don&#x27;t care if its crimp, solder, bailing wire, whatever. Just need to get it booted soonish. Thanks!

                              <span>We are currently in the process of selecting a suitable SD-WAN solution and comparing Palo Alto Prisma SD-WAN and Cisco SD-WAN.
 Does Cisco SD-WAN support in any way dynamic load balancing for &quot;Direct Internet Access&quot;?
 In a DIA scenario, can Cisco SD-WAN automatically distribute traffic to multiple lines in the event of packet loss or full utilization of one line? Are metrics such as packet loss, and round-trip delays measured in a Direct Internet Access scenario (if technically possible)?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 SOLVED: removing update wait-install and update wait-for-convergence removed the issue. (Since this is a container, the routes for the lo0 can never be in hardware, thus will never get advertised with these options.)
 (already posted this in /r/Arista, hope this is ok)
 I&#x27;ve recently wanted to spin up a quick evpn/vxlan lab with containerlab (all nodes running cEOS-lab 4.29.2F), however I&#x27;ve come across the issue that the loopback addresses are not advertised via bgp (from none of the switches), thus the VTEPs are not reachable. 
 P2P Links between DC1-SPINE1 and LEAFs will take a /30 out of 10.1.1.0/24 P2P Links between DC1-SPINE2 and LEAFs will take a /30 out of 10.1.2.0/24 MLAG Peer Links will take a /30 out of 10.1.3.0/24

                              <span>Networking layman here! I just finished configuring this ubiquiti setup for travel gigs; my laptop, iPad, and X32 are all communicating. X32 is providing DHCP within this closed network. 
 When watching different YouTube videos of people setting up their edgerouter x, they further tailored this router through its terminal to be more efficient with their use case. Honesty looked like black magic gibberish…
 I’m wondering if anybody has suggestions to make my network more efficient and dependable. Only thing I did outside of a standard/quick setup was hide my network name on the AP.
 Any suggestions and learning material are appreciated. Currently waiting for “introduction to show networking” by John Huntington.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not a networking pro of any kind. My org. will be hosting a meeting of roughly 100 people, and we&#x27;re here in Alaska, so we buy our data by the GB/TB. 
 Is there some way to guesstimate the amount of data use per person, like caterers do? (For example, they plan on 1/3 lb. of beef per person for tacos. 100 people, do the math, add 10%.) 
 If we go over cap, we get dropped to 10mbps, so that won&#x27;t do. 
 I have indeed tried to research this, but everything comes up with data info for Zoom meetings, etc.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am currently studying NETCONF and YANG data modeling, and so far, I am somewhat understanding creating filters to pull data. I can formulate a filter to request a container within the model, but I cannot figure out how to pull ALL containers at once, aka pulling the entire model&#x27;s worth of data.
 Can someone please assist me in understanding how to do this? For reference, I am using ncclient and the YANG model I am using is ietf-interfaces.yang.
 Thank you.
 Edit: To clarify, I know that in the XML filter, you can call all the containers in one go. However, assuming a YANG model with too many damn containers, I&#x27;d like to find a way to call them all at once in one short, simple filter.

                              <span>So when I learned to terminate cable, I only learned the basics on cat 5, (not even 5e) years ago.
 I just recently got back into the field and I got myself a spool of some NICE cable to have on hand, it&#x27;s Cat6a F/UTP, pure copper, solid 23 AWG, CMR. But it has a ground on the cable and I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it, I got a can of shielded cat6a ends from Amazon and I know it&#x27;s the wrong kind because it&#x27;s really hard to push the wire through and it dosent crimp well, what ends am I suppose to use? What am I supposed to do with the ground? It&#x27;s obviously supposed to terminate onto the connectors but there&#x27;s really no spot on them to do so, TIA

After taking a few IT courses and getting some experience I&#x27;m switching to one of these. It would be nice to get some insight from people in the field and which you see more beneficial in the future. Both degrees look great from my perspective so sorry for my ignorance.
 Computer Science was my 1st choice but I would have to take a term break to take Calculus and re-enter and I don&#x27;t see that being the play at this point, maybe a masters later, who knows.

 I&#x27;m more interested in the details. Give me a problem with an application that nobody knows anything about requiring a reverse engineering deep-dive and I&#x27;ll eat it up. Solving complex problems at the micro level is something I&#x27;d like to pivot to.
 What are some things I could pivot to? TAC seems like the logical answer, but I&#x27;m not sure how the pay would stack up. Network-related product testing/QA was another that caught my eye, but few of those don&#x27;t require a software background. Any outside-the-box stuff I could look at?

                              <span>I was working as a network engineer implementing firewalls and other security solutions. At one point i had to change my job to improve my salary however that was at the expense of experience gaining as my new position is a network consultant and im not involved in the security side. How can i keep my network security knowledge fresh and updated? Any udemy video courses recommended or something?

                              <span>Had another one of those &quot;Where the F*** is that patch cable THIS time?!?!?&quot; moments today while attempting to run down a broken fiber run...I hate being disorganized...like many, I have multiple &quot;universal&quot; bags with a bunch of things just dumped in them because they never have enough small pockets for good organization, and too many pockets big enough to swallow a Toughbook, and it seems like I always just end up dumping it all out looking for one adapter and spend the entire drive home wondering if I forgot to put something back..
 So curious if anyone has any good solutions for organizing a mess of fiber patches, copper patches, various adapters and vendor specific cables, etc. Not really looking for a tool bag for ALL of my crap, just organizing out all the various cables and cable adapters a tech carries in the field. Ideally I&#x27;d rather just have all my cabling and various adapters in one location, but I&#x27;m not 100% opposed to separating it out to fiber and copper related.

                              <span>I have a M370 Watchguard switch. Interfaces are configure in Mixed routing mode. I have an Trusted interface, it is actually 4 ports in a link aggregation, and a tagged Vlan interface in a different port for a different network. The both goes to the same switch. The link aggregation goes to the switch in access mode with all the ports in Vlan1. The VLan interface goes to a trunk port in that switch. I am trying to give access to the Trusted 1 to the Vlan interface (only some users but for the sake of the question lets says all).
 I created 4 policies TCP/UDP, from trusted to Vlan10, Vlan10 to trusted. and 2 same way for http and https since what is behind Vlan10 are cameras that I need to manage using browser. No matter what I do I do not manage to send or get traffic from or to the Vlan interface. I can ping the cameras from the wathcguard but that is it.

                              <span>Hi! I am not a network engineer by any stretch so this is mainly a high level question. 
 We are wanting to operate a popup wifi network for an outdoor event in a field. We have a basic idea of a design hardware wise and want to see if it’s even in the ballpark of where we need to be. We are wanting to keep the design value oriented since this will only be used for specific events. We want to support up to 5000 users with basic mobile phone usage over Wi-Fi. We have a 10gb fiber backhaul.

 Would this cover our needs? We will have a 3rd party captive portal for authentication. This is for high level preliminary budgeting purposes. 
 Thanks!
 Edit:
 Thanks to those with constructive replies. We are definitely hiring a consultant and will have network engineers running the the show. This was a basic post to ask a question for a ballpark budgetary check. Should’ve posted this in the moronic question Monday or whatever it’s called.

                              <span>Anyone try to do a cpdl firmware upgrade on these devices? This afternoon, I tried twice with a failed due to corrupt image. 
 I downloaded the image and pushed it to the device, did an md5 verification and came back good. 
 I also tried issuing the upgrade command to R0 and then RP active with the same result. 
 I guess I can try redownloading the image and trying again but wanted to know if I’m missing something. Seems pretty straightforward though. 
 Not a major issue, just trying to clear a bug relating to power environment logs. I did upgrade to the latest gold star IOS-XE software beforehand. 
 Just looking to see if anyone experienced this.

                              <span>I have been running EVE-NG community edition for labs with cisco ios images for a couple months. I am overall very happy with the lab environment EVE provides. The one issue I have never been able to resolve is pasting in commands into the web browser CLI. It would save me quite a bit of time in my labs if I was able to copy and paste the initial device configurations directly into the web browser CLI (i.e. interface ip&#x27;s, device name, username/password etc.). I am able to use PuTTY to SSH into my devices from windows but this requires me to set up SSH on each device individually. Hoping someone has a quick solution that would save me time so I can focus on the core lessons of the labs.

 I think I have to use event manager but its not clear on how to do so.
 To make things more secure I would like to do this with public key auth, however I am not sure how to convert the cisco&#x27;s output for the rsa public key to something I can put into a authorized_key file for trust, does anyone have instructions on how to do this too?

                              <span>Im feeling really dumb about this question but i dont get the logic of my Tp Link Archer MR200v5. (SIM Card Router)
 I want to disable NAT, so that my firewall (IPFire/Fortigate) can do NAT. But I dont know how to configure it.
 When i disable NAT, i dont get the public IP on my firewall via DHCP, manually doesnt work neighter. Using PPPOE/DialUp and all that doesnt make sense neighter, because the router shows that he is already connected and has a public IP Adress, even when i disable NAT, so why should the firewall dial in when the router already did that
 So where is my error in my brain or in my configuration
 I just want my firewalls to get my only public ip adress so i can block certain countries for hosting

                              <span>Small, private, K12 One Man Show here. Long history in SOHO env. First and only job not in SOHO.
 I recently picked up a pair of used managed switches (TP-Link T1600G-28PS) for 1/4 the price of new ones. We have all TP-Link managed switches, so I&#x27;m planning ahead now.
 So, I go to test them; it boots up just fine and loads the web UI. Just like I&#x27;m used to, except this one is super quiet. Then I realize...the fans are off. Not low, they&#x27;re O-F-F. Is that normal and to be expected? Did I just not notice the others doing this in the din of our &quot;MDF&quot;?
 I&#x27;ve seen a few machines running with no fans: I have an EdgeRouter (fan-less) at home and an arsenal of Raspberry Pis. But I&#x27;ve never seen this level of equipment running with no fans.
 So, should I be concerned? Does they need to be repaired or replaced? I&#x27;m not in tune with the thermodynamics (heat management) of network equipment. Please advise.
 FWIW, if I put these in production, they could potentially be feeding power to a few SIP phones and IP cameras (max 5W for both devices).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard that unexpected things can happen when changing to higher link speeds, and now I&#x27;m experiencing it first hand. We&#x27;ve been transitioning from the c4500 series to c9400 chassis, and haven&#x27;t had a single link issue until recently, when we started installing c9400&#x27;s with 5 gig boards, specifically C9400-LC-48HN, running XE version 17.6.4(MD) on the SUP-1XL. 
 There have been over 10 instances where a Windows NIC (almost always Intel I219-LM network card) fails to connect, but after switching cables and wall jacks a few times, the link decides to come up. These NICs can always connect immediately if there is a hub, unmanaged switch or even a shark tap in between the host and the switch (when I tried to do a packet capture with the tap, I couldn&#x27;t replicate &amp; analyze the problem).

                              <span>We’re desperately looking for a network person. Thankfully I’ll be involved in hiring this round. I’m looking for tried and true questions/tasks that you’ve used that will at least let us know if this person is the real deal. 
 Aside from conventional tech questions I’m also looking for something a bit challenging that will gauge someone’s work ethic (our last hire was abysmal at this). Honestly I’m more ok with someone who has more room to grow but will take charge / be reliable than someone who has (claims) vast knowledge but thinks certain tasks are beneath them.

I can ping the management interface from all the other switches, as well as the computer in the same rack. But no GUI will pull up. Any ideas? We will be onsite next week, but it would be nice to configure it before we get there. Thanks for any suggestions.

                              <span>Sorting IP addresses in Excel creates results in situations where 100.0.0.1 will come before 20.0.0.1 because they are treated as text and 1 comes before 2. All the research I&#x27;ve done points to having to split the IP into four columns, sorting them, and recombining them as the only way to get Excel to realize that 20 comes before 100. This would work fine for a static document but for a living one, it quickly becomes a problem.
 Does anyone have a tip or trick to get it to sort IPs correctly without resorting to the process described above or use a program they can recommend that is similar to Excel but knows how to sort them correctly?
 Edit: Thank you for all of the input. I think I need to research some IPAMs now to see if any of those will work for what I&#x27;m needing to do.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I wanted to see if anyone had any reccomendations for a router that does well with BGP (currently we have an ISR-4451-X and are looking to upgrade and stick with Cisco (due to our service support and contracts). This router will only handle North and South traffic as an aggregation of multiple service providers. Below is the one that I had found and though could be a good idea but let me know! 
 Upgrade: https://www.cdw.com/product/cisco-catalyst-8500l-8s4x-switch-12-ports-rack-mountable/6440839?enkwrd&#x3D;C8500L-8S4X

                              <span>Anyone has success using the ensp emulator for huawei? I saw that support for it ended a while ago but i needed something to do emulation. I found that it&#x27;s buggy sometimes. E.g sometimes if i have subinterfaces configured i get no arp entries or unable to ping across the network.I have to reboot the nodes and they might work. If i use the bare interfaces they work fine. I tried the same images in eve but it seems to be the same. Anyone with a working alternative or any ideas?

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I&#x27;m struggling to find a concise answer from google so thought I would ask here.
 Is RSTP Switch brand dependent? I have an SMB site where we want to swap out the switches currently running most of their network for new Zyxel Models w/PoE which seem to work well for us and have easy and quick config changes via mobile app - I am then looking to move the existing switches D-Link&#x27;s over to their server cabinet for use here and wanted to use RSTP so if i lose a link between any of the switches in the loop it would be able to get round the other way. 
 I&#x27;ve had this running fine on a single brand of switches but is it possible between different switch brands? I&#x27;m looking to keep the older switches to save on costs
 Thanks

                              <span>In my design, I have filtered an IP address from some routers using route-map command, and so when I ping this address from a source router, I am sure that the request traffic does not pass through the filtered routers (Routing protocol is OSPF). However, the reply traffic may pass through the filtered routers yet. How can I avoid this situation without filtering the source IP address in the routers?

                              <span>If one single ip is advertised via BGP from multiple peers with equal AD/COST and in the routing table all routes are showing (AKA ECMP) how the packets will be forwared in this case?
 say for eg:
  
 192.168.12.20 is reachable via 192.168.5.1-&gt; node1 
  
  192.168.10.2-&gt; node2 
   192.168.3.4-&gt; node3 
 
 will the packets be forwared in RR?
 Is it better to do load balance between nodes this way or use external load balancer like LVS/CITRIX ADC/ F5-BIGip ?
 In my case RR will do just fine.

 Most of them are POE switches, managed and unmanaged, different brands.
 How can I test them correctly under load? I used iperf bandwidth test on a port by port basis, let the bandwidth test run for a few minutes but that didn&#x27;t work as espected as I did found a switch on wich the ports get stuck when 6 or more devices get connected.
 Is there a way to properly test switches? And POE on then

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m about to start implementing high availability on 2 sets of firewalls and i&#x27;m going to be doing SSL proxy decryption on them, regarding the device certs that i&#x27;m going to be putting on them, do i need just the one device cert signed by our root CA and then if there is a failure then that cert will be replicated and used on the standby PA? That&#x27;s what i&#x27;m thinking, or do i need 4 individual certs on each firewall?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Forgive me, it&#x27;s late and I will do my best to collect my thoughts after 30 hours of non stop troubleshooting: 
 About 6 months ago I took over about 10 full racks of HPC, NAS, and a variety of servers performing varying tasks at a datacenter in Southern California.
 Now before you bust out the flamethrowers, I understand NIS is insecure; but I&#x27;ve taken on this project and I&#x27;ve been working on a FreeIPA replacement.. In the meantime everything continues to function well, till last Friday.
 Last Friday I get a call from one of the research professors mentioning that access to the HPC has gone down. I check and see that the NIS client on the HPC cluster can no longer communicate with the NIS server. So I do some tests:

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m curious as to how you guys go about setting up WiFi in dense high rise buildings?
 Ive got a office 1 of 3 on a middle floor and the WiFi spectrum is just saturated, from what I can tell everyone side to side and above and below are all set to auto so everything I just jumping all over the place. 
 What&#x27;s best practice to actually set up my office to be as resilient as I can? As it is people get occasional drop outs (enough to kill a teams call). 
 I&#x27;ve got 3x Meraki MR18&#x27;s (I know theyre old I&#x27;ve asked for new stuff but I&#x27;m not holding my breathe) to work with any suggestions would be appreciated.

 I was just curious what everyone else thought about the best place to purchase and setup domains on.

                              <span>Hopefully this will save time for others.
 We recently started rolling out Surface Laptop 5 to our staff, replacing old models. Almost immediately staff started complaining about USB devices (keyboard/mouse/whatever) disconnecting at random times or not working at all.
 We spent one month troubleshooting to the point that we stopped any further purchases while working with Microsoft support.
 The issue turns out to be SentinelOne. 
 Scenario:
  
Device with Intel Smart Sound Technology for USB Audio – affects ALL Surface Laptop 5, but not 4 – probably it needs to be a specific hardware.
 S1 with Device Control enabled – it just needs to be enabled, no rules needed – We can reproduce with agent version 22.1 , 22.2 and 22.3
 Users plugs in a USB device that interact with the audio subsystem, directly to the USB port of to a USB hub, connected to the laptop, which would include : webcams, headsets, etc…
 All USB devices connected to the laptop (whether USB hub, USB hub through a dock, or directly), crash and disconnect, sometime the laptop may bluescreen or freeze.
 Uninstalling S1 agent immediately fixes the behaviour
 To workaround the issue and allow S1 agent to be installed, we had to add the following override, in S1 console under settings-policy override
  
​
 {
 &quot;deviceControl&quot;: {
 &quot;excludedDeviceSetupClasses&quot;: [
 &quot;{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}&quot;
 ]
 }
 }
 ​
  
the 4d36 etc is the GUID Class ID of the Intell SST USB interface, you can grab it by right clicking on the device in device manager.
 Change will immediately apply, no restart needed, to all devices in the scope where you configured the policy override.
  
​
 I have passed all these info to S1 support so they hopefully can release new version of the agent.

                              <span>Just like the title says, I&#x27;m seeing this weird &quot;bug&quot;(?) on about half of my Win 10 systems. My patch management hasn&#x27;t updated them to 22H2 yet, which I thought was strange. After doing manual update checks, I am able to get 22H2 to appear 100% of the time, only after clicking &quot;Stay on windows 10 for now&quot;. It will not show available until win 11 is declined via the banner in the &quot;check for updates&quot; window. I don&#x27;t have any GP&#x27;s enforcing versions. Has anyone else seen this or found a workaround?

 If I were MS I would feel embarrassed. It&#x27;s a virtual certainty that any of the folks on this subreddit know more about their product than their first few levels of support. But since they&#x27;re the gatekeepers under some circumstances, you&#x27;re left with no choice but to suffer through days of aimless questions. 
 The language barrier in some cases for me is to the point where I can&#x27;t even understand what&#x27;s being asked of me.
 It&#x27;s just a deeply frustrating experience. For one of the largest corporations in the world, they should be able to do much better on the support side of their business.

                              <span>Been digging on this for a bit and can&#x27;t find a straight answer.
 Our quarantine policy allows for end users to release emails from quarantine, but I was wondering if this is still submitting them for machine learning to improve the system.
 What made me question this was noticing that the end user doesn&#x27;t have the option to &quot;Report to Microsoft to improve detection&quot; like an admin does when they release an email.
 End users do have the option &quot;Report message as having no threats&quot; but they are still getting multiple quarantines from the same domain and senders.
 Obviously I can whitelist the domains/senders/IPs in Policies and Rules, but this lead me to wonder are the end user releases actually sending data to machine learning?

                              <span>Please tell me I&#x27;m just doing something wrong!
 We&#x27;ve inherited an environment with a PowerVault MD3800i. We installed a few new drives in it (model MG03SCA400) that are listed in Dell&#x27;s Support Matrix
 Using MDSM, the drives are seen but theirStatus and Mode are both listed as &quot;Incompatible&quot;.
 My first instinct is that this is because they&#x27;re on firmware version 0108 while DG09 is what is supported.
 The trouble is, I can&#x27;t get the new firmware onto them! I go to Upgrade&gt;Physical Disk Firmware, and choose the file, which MDSM does say that it&#x27;s compatible with them. 
 Then I try to load it onto these drives it returns Error 249 - failed because they are bypassed/offline. (Incidentally I tried this in Online/All/Parallel modes)
 So unless I&#x27;m missing something it looks like a catch-22; I can&#x27;t upload the firmware because the firmware is out of date.

                              <span>So I got approached by someone who wants me to come work for them. The pay is going to be more, the estate is probably 10x’s bigger than my current place, and it’s a spin off from a huge company. So it’s sorta like a startup in the way that the tech is all shiney and new. No legacy stuff at all. 
 I love my current job. We are also shiney and new and since we are way smaller, I’m well known by everyone, even the C-Suite. They know the names of my wife and kids and always ask about them when they see me. I’m also respected and one of the leaders others seek out. 
 The team is siloed into 5 parts at the new place and I will be leading one of the silos but will take part in the other areas. Today, I do all 5 parts and do them well. So I’ll be less focused on those other areas. Also my work load is insanely easy at my current place. I can work 60 hours one week and maybe 40 minutes other weeks. I can come and go as I please at my current place, my boss doesn’t care what I do. The people at my current place are also some of the smartest people I’ve got to work with. And I have known and worked with these people (holy shit this just occurred to me when I did the math) for MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE! 
 I’m really torn here. Any thoughts from people who have been in this situation?
 Edit: A couple of the posts here answered the question. This post could tend to get a lot of responses so I’m going to stick with the current gig. I’ve been here since I was a teenager (buy outs, ipos, spin-offs). I haven’t had a real interview in 25 years so I’m going to get to the end of the interview process at this new place and kindly decline. I don’t want to burn bridges.

                              <span>I am curious as to what other sysadmins are doing to keep their windows networks all in sync. 
 Lately, more and more I am seeing domain joined hosts that just will not sync their time from a domain controller for love nor money.
 In most of these cases the time source becomes &quot;Local CMOS&quot;
 I have tried multiple guides online and usually what I end up doing is giving up and setting an NTP server on the workstation side which is not ideal 
 Does anyone have any sort of SOP for doing this, or any advice on best practice?
 Thanks
 Edit: thanks for all the comments people I will go through all these suggestions. Seems more complicated than it needs to be generally.

We recently had a cyber attack, which resulted in my beloved director leaving and going to a bigger international company, because he received a lot of push back from upper management and the engineering staff with us doing basic things such as patching and upgrading systems to newer OS&#x27;s which lead to the attack. My old director offered me a job at the new company starting at 85k a year with a 18kish bonus yearly managing their virtual environment, backups, and storage, the caveat is I would have an hour commute each way 5 days a week for 6 months before going hybrid, and it sounded like that date might get pushed back more.

 What am I doing wrong? Is it due to the market? I admit that I know Azure, AD, Office 365 and have used Windows server but don’t have advanced knowledge, especially of server backups. I have 2 years of work experience, a Business IT Management degree and am studying for Network plus.
 How can I conduct myself in interviews better? I do dress up in an office shirt with a tie.

                              <span>This past week I&#x27;ve suddenly had 5 laptops flagged for hard drive usage exceeding 95%. Turns out it was the same issue for every one. Something was up with the Windows System Protection and Restore settings. The disk space usage was set to 100% which in turn filled up the entire drive. 
 Solution: Run &gt; sysdm.cpl &gt; System Protection tab &gt; Configure button &gt; Delete all restore points and move the slider down to something lower (I&#x27;ve been choosing 10%). No restart required, but not a bad idea to do one. 
 I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s causing it. Just thought I would post something in case others ran into it :)
 EDIT - /u/SauceAdmin noted this potentially being a Dell issue specifically with the SupportAssist app: https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12pi2im/suddenly_workstations_have_95_full_hard_drives/jgmjgg7/

                              <span>Hey guys and girls. Hope you&#x27;re all doing fine! 
 How you handle with Accounts in Windows Devices to remote workers? The device is sent with a local Admin account and a Work account (to the user)? Or only Work account?
 Which one may be the best approach?
 We&#x27;ll use Intune (AAD Joined) with Microsoft 365 accounts (Work Account) to the remote users. 
 The computer will be sent by a service provider, so I&#x27;ll not have access to configure it by myself before received by the employee. 
 Thanks :)

                              <span>We were a bit late to the show on enabling proper DKIM and DMARC policies in our environment, but finally implemented it in our O365 tenant. 
 As a result, some vendors that send emails on our behalf (using our domain) have been routing to junk/spam as expected. We have resolved issues with vendors that support DKIM signing and DMARC, however some vendors just flat out don&#x27;t support it. Before DKIM and DMARC we were able to allow these emails through just with basic mail flow rules.
 Service Fusion for example is a vendor that doesn&#x27;t seem to support it (https://dmarc.io/source/service-fusion/). How do you deal with these particular vendors? I have suggested to my service manager to use the default domain (as opposed to using our domain), however he&#x27;s wondering why we can&#x27;t leave it the way it&#x27;s always been.
 From his perspective, our &quot;enhancements&quot; to our email security are a step backwards for him and his department. He&#x27;s requesting us to revert our changes (which we&#x27;re not interested in doing). It seems to me like the obvious way to proceed is to use the out of the box domain instead of trying to spoof our domain without proper DKIM and DMARC, but I was just interested what the community&#x27;s opinion is on this?

                              <span>I am deploying (badly) the Unreal Engine to several classrooms of Windows PCs, 100+ machines. The main hurdle here is the size of the Unreal Engine assets (36GB compressed, 122GB decompressed).
 I have a roughly 20-30 minute window in the evening when I can perform this task via a shutdown script. This shutdown task can be split over multiple reboots so its not essential that the action take place in one run, as long as I can gracefully pick up where it left off on the previous reboot. You may ask, why dont you extend the shutdown time out on the script, I could, but I am managing an estate of 4000 PC&#x27;s, I dont want to make a fundamental change to the other ~3900 just for these 100.
 ​
 The machines are all of a similar spec (decent Intel i5&#x27;s, miniumum of 8GB RAM, SSD drives etc), network…</span>

I have a GPO setup to force it to L3 but you can still open it and play around with the slider until you reboot. I just want to see if it can be locked (greyed out) so nothing can be touched until the GPO unlocks it?

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all. Long time lurker here!
 I am doing some very preliminary research on a couple tools but am not ready to do demos yet. Not looking for recommendations for other tools either.
 Anyone willing to share recent pricing on these? I know that these are not all exactly in the same bucket, but they seem to have some carryover for what we are doing with ITOps and SecOps.
  
Tanium (I hear its pricy...but what does pricy mean?)
 Tenable
 Ivanti
 Automox (just for patching)
  
Thanks in advance! I really appreciate any insight you can provide! 
 edit: Realized I was spelling Ivanti wrong. Too late in the title. :P

                              <span>We are noticing a recent spate of phishing attempts that are bypassing Microsoft safe link URL rewrites simply by leaving off the &quot;http&quot; prefix of URLs. The email clients still are translating the URL to a hyperlink but it becomes unprotected. I opened up a case about it. 
 Has anyone seen this, or do you have a workaround? I am a bit surprised that it can be bypassed so easily and wonder if something changed.

Boss and I are blanking on ideas. Anyone have any ideas for a quick, informative/educational activity?
 Asking in the sysadmin community because I&#x27;m a sysadmin/IT Manager, and hopefully someone has some ideas. Thanks! :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just deployed three new server 2022 vms (foo, bar, quux). Normally they&#x27;d all auto-register their DNS with the domain controllers and so I&#x27;d be able to access them using \foo, \bar, \quux etc.
 For some reason, in this case this hasn&#x27;t happened. There&#x27;s no entry put into AD&#x27;s DNS server for these systems.
 If I go on to one of them and try to ping the others, it works, but using an ipv6 address.
 If I disable ipv6 then try ping again, it works, but it says the target system name is &#x27;
.local&#x27;
 This was a standard deployment of server 2022 using MDT and in Feb I deployed machines the same way and they worked fine.
 Does anyone have any idea what might be going on?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Are there any Windows update management solutions that provide comparable control and visibility to WSUS, but don&#x27;t require line of sight to a server in order for clients to update? Windows Update for Business policies are very generic and not a WSUS replacement.
 What I mean by comparable control and visibility to WSUS is:
  
For every update, you can see which computers have installed, not installed, failed install, or are pending reboot to install it.
 You can make groups out of computers to report on and control
 Each update is explicitly approved by you (or a script/criteria you built) for each group, and under no circumstances can Microsoft push anything to clients without your permission.
 Drivers can be included if you&#x27;re willing to deal with them on this level, or excluded and done automatically.
  
I don&#x27;t like having to choose between control and visibility and the risk of remote users who don&#x27;t use the VPN enough being outdated, or them just not being managed at all.

 When should I follow up? She said that they’d follow up in the next few weeks. 
 Do I have the job, since I interviewed with the executive? I heard it’s a very good sign

 I am going through an upgrade program in our enviroment. We currently have a mix of 2008 R2 and 2012R2 servers. I am going to be building new servers to replace them.
 Is it ok to add a 2022 member server to a 2008 domain? Should I build the new 2022 DC first?
 ​
 Thank you!

 I have a client who has the following &quot;problem&quot;:
 There are 16 printers in a remote location that need to be connected and available to print on demand via the internet. Printers would be connected via Wi-Fi to a central router/modem.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a router/modem and printer combination that can facilitate this job?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve got Azure AD Connect setup and running ok. It syncs our local user accounts to cloud.
 I now want to start using O365 for pwd reset and need Azure AD Connect to sync the passwords from cloud to premises. 
 Azure AD app has Password hash synchronisation and Password writeback enabled.
 I’ve tried to reset a test account’s password but the password is not syncing back to premises. I can use the new password in O365, but can’t login to PC unless using old pwd.
 Synchronisation Service Manager shows latest sync and I can see the results user properties, and lastPasswordChange is howling as none.
 Any ideas on where to look?
 Many thanks in advance

 This post seems a bit ridiculous but ive never ran into this issue before and cant seem to figure it out. Ive got a virtual network set up in vmware and my AD and database machines just keep shutting down when left unattended. All the power settings i can identify have been changed to turn off - never but it keeps doing it. I feel silly asking but im stumped, any tips would be appreciated

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m fairly new to the company and much more responsibility than my last company so I&#x27;ve got way more to do.
 For the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why it fails to cast to smart tv&#x27;s in the office and a Microsoft adapter, I know it uses the same technology. WIFI.
 This is what i&#x27;ve found out.
 - Casting to smart TV&#x27;s on laptops that are not domain joined and not on the wifi *WORK*
 - Trying to cast from domain joined laptops fails or buffers endlessly
 - Disconnecting from the company domain WIFI also fails from a domain joined laptop.
 ​
 So it seems the issue isn&#x27;t down to the network configuration but down to a laptop being domain joined.
 Does anyone else have any idea what to look at/check/do?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve come for your help once again /r/sysadmin 
 In preparation of migrating to Win11, and also because of general security, I am in the midst of moving our 802.1x authentication from PEAP to EAP-TLS. I am stuck on an issue that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out despite reading documentation, watching tutorials etc. 
 I have a Computer group that i&#x27;ll call EAPTLS-group and a computer that I&#x27;ll call Computer1, that is a member of EAPTLS-group. I have set up NPS policys for ethernet, using smartcard of other certificate and enrolled the certificate used so that it is visible on Computer1. Being a member of EAPTLS-group is a requirement. The CA is the same as the NPS server. 
 GPO is set to:
 Autoenroll certificate and renew certs based on templates
 &quot;SmartCard or other certificate&quot; network auth method
 &quot;Computer Only&quot; auth mode
 Selected certificate issuer as well as trusted root CA&#x27;s
 defined what server to connect to for NPS
 ​
 GPO is applied to:
 OU that Computer1 is placed in
 Authenticated users (also tried security filtering EAPTLS-group but that made no difference)
 ​
 To the issue:
 When trying to connect the NPS security logs say that for Computer1: &quot;The Network Access Permission setting in the dial-in properties of the user account in Active Directory is set to Deny access to the user. To change the Network Access Permission setting to either Allow access or Control access through NPS Network Policy, obtain the properties of the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers, click the Dial-in tab, and change Network Access Permission&quot; 
 This is not true, as it is set to Control access through NPS 
 Any ideas as to what might be happening? My apologies if I&#x27;m being unclear, I&#x27;m happy to specify 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been really healthy until I started a standing job 4 months ago. Despite the fact that I work only 4h a day (while my colleagues work 8h a day and they are all healthy) my legs and feet don&#x27;t function like they would anymore. My feet can&#x27;t hold me and I feel the pressure in the nerves of the metatarsal area. It&#x27;s so painful and is causing foot deformation. Besides I had episodes of very painful legs, and blue veins (not swollen) I could see through the skin of my legs. I tried compression socks and they work wonders, but I can never go back to be default settings, a.k.a healthy legs. Am I experiencing early symptoms of deep vein thrombosis/blood clotting? Can this be just cause I am pearshaped and most of my weight is in my lower body? Please help me with any advice, thank you!

 Recently a regkey &quot;NoAutoRebootwithLoggedOnUsers&quot; was set to zero in order to let the PCs to reboot themselves automatically at the scheduled install date/time. It works as expected except that they got stuck at the bitlocker screen.
 My question is, is it a default behaviour that bitlocker is not suspended for Windows patch installation and reboot?

                              <span>We are considering rebuilding our Windows Server Datacenter Hyper-V hypervisors from 2019 to 2022.
 Our VMs are Server 2019, a few Windows 10, several Linux Ubuntu. We are also contemplating move all or most 2019 servers to 2022.
 To be clear - on the hypervisors we will move VMs to other hosts, wipe an reinstall, and move the VMs back . We will not do an in place upgrade.
 I am interested in your experiences if you have done any of this.
  
What is better?
 
What is worse?
 
What issues, major and minor, have you encountered?
 
 Thanks

 Any and all suggestions or if someone has a link to a complied list of end user scripts that would be handy!

                              <span>So last year we replaced the old PCs in the brach I work for by new laptops with windows 11 pre-installed so I just addedd them to the domain
 When users tried to download apps from the official app store they got this error 
 https://ibb.co/85Xkpgh
 I asked in MS support community and some suggested that account for work are not supported in win11
 So I am not sure, anyone face this issue?

 ​
 Got an Outlook issue that I cannot solve, so thought I&#x27;d put it to the hive mind.
 We are running Windows 10/11. Server 2019/2022, Office 365 and unfortunately Roaming Profiles (I know, I know, but this isn&#x27;t changing anytime soon)
 We have a .vbs file that get user info from AD (On Prem) and runs via a logon script in GP to add a group of signatures to Outlook (It contains 4 different signatures as our company has 4 different entities)
 When we logon with a new user, this .vbs script does it&#x27;s thing as it should but it tries to open Outlook 2016 (Note we are using 365) and tries to connect to an Exchange server which we no longer have, to be able to load the users emails.
 Everytime, I have to cancel this process, the run the actual Outlook (365) to get the user into their emails
 Anyone got any idea how I can stop this happening? I have set up a new user on AD using folder redirection rather than a Roaming Profile and it loads normally, I just have to logoff and back on to be able to view the signatures in Outlook 365
 ​
 If anyone could shed any light it would be appreciated.

                              <span>I’m using Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) and it’s letting too many spam messages through. I hoped that upgrade to spamassassin 4 would make a difference, but nope.
 So I’m looking for options for a gateway solution and what I gather is that rspamd seems to be great. But is there a portal/product that it can be interfaced with so users can review, block and allow?
 Another big downer for PMG is that it’s not at all mobile friendly, something essential in this day and age.

                              <span>Hey,
 So I got an email from Microsoft recently. Subject &quot;Migrate to the Authentication methods policy in Azure Active Directory by 30 September 2024&quot;.
 And I wanted to try following the instructions and try it in a small tenant of around 10 people, that I very sporadically give support to, before doing the same on other tenants.
 MFA and SSPR were already setup before. No Conditional Access available (only using M365 Business Standard).
 The instructions on this page are pretty good and easy to follow. Essentially, I enabled and configured the methods that were being used before in either MFA or SSPR.
 I do have a doubt though. At the end of article, it says:
  
Finish the migration 
 After you update the Authentication methods policy, go through the legacy MFA, and SSPR policies and remove each authentication method one-by-one. Test and validate the changes for each method.
  
So I followed through and cleared all the methods and saved successfully.
  
MFA service settings - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
 Password reset | Authentication methods - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
  
​
 My question is:
 In the new policy (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/kV4xITt.png ), where is it being defined which methods are available to users willing to self reset their password ? This was very easy to understand in the previous &quot;Password reset | Authentication methods&quot; page but now I&#x27;m a little bit confused.
 ​
 Edit: cleared text, added new screenshots.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in IT for almost 20 years now since leaving university and looking for my next role and relaised I have a huge lack of professional qualifications which is hampering my search. Currently I run the IT systems years for a small finance company in London (35 people), and I&#x27;ve been there over 6 years now. While I like the variety, challenge and autonomy, things like professional development and training haven&#x27;t been forthcoming which has left me with no recent professional qualifications.
 My CV currently only lists ITIL Foundation v3 as a professional certification, which is now woefully out of date, but I feel like at least ITIL hasn&#x27;t changed that much. I have however, made the choice to omit all of MS certifcations from 10 years ago as it really doesn&#x27;t look great to have things like Server 2008 and SQL 2012 listed given how dated they are now.
 So my question is this, given that my free time is limited like most people, which are the best certifications to get which are fairly short 1-2 day courses and fairly cheap, while also providing good prospects for future roles, and a good line to have on my CV and LinkedIn. Ideally in the realms of cyber security, change management and the Azure Cloud.
 My initial thoughts are
 Cyber Essentials
 ISO 27001
 MS Partner courses in the more advanced areas of Azure Load balancing and cloud server migration.
 Maybe looking into upgrading to ITIL v4
 Change management courses
 ​
 I would love some feedback and suggestions, thanks!

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have taken over the responsibility to secure our hardware setup, and as it is right now it is all just a bunch of computers in 12 different stores and 2 offices + 70 laptops users can loan.
 Most of the pc&#x27;s are used as Cash registers. 
 My plan was to do the following:
  
TeamViewer on all computers for easy support
 TeamViewer Monitor to secure pc&#x27;s are up to date and secure
 SpiceWorks agent for Inventory
 Create Admin account on all pc&#x27;s and create a user account for the users
  
How would you all handle this?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I wrote free little tool to do some DNS auditing and have just recently added Whois information. I’d love to get some feedback on it and to see if it is useful for anyone.

                              <span>A bit of a panic this morning. A local excel file I&#x27;ve been labouring on for the past 2 weeks has reverted back and I&#x27;ve lost all my work after an update. I&#x27;d diligently saved it, during work, but it&#x27;s somehow reverted back to a version before all the work I put in on it.

                              <span>I have a managerial request to somehow populate everyone&#x27;s personal Outlook calendar with public holidays as well as mandatory shutdown periods (Christmas time I guess). This will need to automatically fill any new user&#x27;s calendar.
 It&#x27;s essentially controlling items in other people&#x27;s calendars which I don&#x27;t think is possible. Ttelling everyone to just hit the Holiday button in Options doesn&#x27;t cut it. I&#x27;ve tried creating and sending an all day event to my test calendar but it doesn&#x27;t prevent the recipient from hitting the Decline button. It&#x27;s also nothing short of cumbersome.
 I don&#x27;t think there is a practical solution, but there might be other methods I haven&#x27;t thought of. So... open to ideas if anyone has attempted this.

                              <span>Hope all are well,
 ​
 I&#x27;ll start by explaining the dilemma I&#x27;m currently facing;
 I have a client who has slightly under 1 million folders/files in a single SharePoint site.
 They have had syncing issues for a fair bit of time now. Syncing from the explorer to the cloud
 can take anywhere from 5minutes-1 hour (sometimes many more or not at all).
 ​
 I have tested with a brand new SharePoint site with instant syncing (just to confirm it has nothing to do with the environment).
 ​
 Anyway, so my question is how common is 1 single SharePoint site for the entire business? How many files is technically &quot;too many&quot; regardless of what MS claims it can handle.
 I&#x27;m planning on rebuilding the SharePoint structure into individual sites per folder below;
 Jobs
 Quotes
 Projects
 Accounting
 Management
 Etc.
 ​
 I know I&#x27;m not Houdini and this is standard but it&#x27;ll lead up to my second question;
 I&#x27;m having a hell of a time splitting the files since I keep reaching &quot;File count over limit&quot;.
 Any PowerShell scripts that have worked for you guys moving larger folders?
 I have tried a few different scripts but to no avail unfortunately.
 ​
 Any tricks would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>APT28 accesses poorly maintained Cisco routers and deploys malware on unpatched devices using CVE-2017-6742.
Overview and Context
The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US National Security Agency (NSA), US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint advisory to provide details of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28’s exploitation of Cisco routers in 2021.
We assess that APT28 is almost certainly the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th special Service Centre (GTsSS) Military Intelligence Unit 26165. APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, the Sednit Gang and Sofacy) is a highly skilled threat actor.

                              <span>Hey all, so I’m trying to figure out this issue. So far a small group of users (2 or 3) are experiencing freezing whenever they receive an email via Outlook or Teams. We’re running M365 with exchange online. The freeze lasts roughly as long as the desktop notification then stops. We switched to M365 roughly 6 months ago, and this issue happened within the past 2 weeks. Now one thing thst happened was thst the feature preview caused the app bar at the bottom of the nav lane to move to the left side. That and us switching to FS Logix to replace roaming profiles are the only real changes that I know of. As far as troubleshooting goes I’ve disabled notifications for anything to show on desktop, rebuilt the local profile, rebuilt the outlook profile, disabled the updated apps bar, and no dice. I have not noticed this on the physical machine, only when removing via Citrix storefront to use RDP, or use the Citrix Desktop. We’re using on prem AD, Citrix VDA to support multiple users to one server, I’m one of the users effected. If anyone has any ideas or needs any clarification I am an open book ask me and I’ll answer. Thank you all for your help!!

                              <span>Fellow admin 
 I got an account which is Google Workspace Business Starter. This gives me 30gb per user. In the past, if a user needed 100gb or more, in the storage section, the account could be upgraded for an extra amount per month or year. Google has killed off this feature.
 The only way forward is upgrading to Workspace business standard, which gives a 2Tb pooled storage. However, this also doubles the user/month cost, which does not sit well with the board. (Moving the whole business off the Google account is a nightmare I don&#x27;t really want to face). 
 What other external storage options do you guys use? 
 Basically external storage, cloud or self hosted, not looking at OneDrive or Dropbox, as I&#x27;m hoping there is something that would be possible to integrate with Google drive.

I have 2 SSID&#x27;s ,while connecting to them,I get correct ip address from DHCP but I lose internet connectivity after a while. Is this due to something related to vlan tagging?because when I give SSID the native vlan everything seems to be working fine. Any suggestions are appreciated. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Final update: https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1647774237896368130?t&#x3D;45eqpJBOf1MxgNRwA_djZQ&amp;s&#x3D;19
 @Netflix: To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned. We&#x27;re filming it now and we&#x27;ll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.
 Love is Blind is doing a live event. ~Apparently this is their first live event / episode.~ this is not the first live event.
 Servers are down, no one can connect. They communicated 15 minutes until online and now it&#x27;s been 20.
 Oof.
 Update: 28 minutes in and still down
 Update 2: 43 minutes in, still down. The hosts posted an update on Instagram saying they&#x27;re working on it still
 Update 3: 57 minutes in, still down. Maybe they have an internal go live at 6pm pst, one hour in?
 Update 4: 62 minutes in, still down. We&#x27;re in this for the long haul. This is bad lmao especially since they have the cast there just awkwardly waiting until they can stream it live
 Update 5: 75 minutes in, still down. All influencers are now streaming from their Instagram accounts and it looks like chaos
 Update 6: POSSIBLE FIX: PLAY THE EPISODE 12 AND FAST FORWARD TO THE ENDING. THEN ITLL SAY NEXT EPISODE AND PLAY
 Update 7: Well, it played for about 2 minutes live and then crashed again
 I was able to get in after 86 minutes. Now I can&#x27;t get in again. Some people are streaming it off their phone on TikTok and IG
 apparently Netflix canceled the live stream and they&#x27;re just recording it to post later. Not sure how true this is but it seems it is, they&#x27;re going ahead with the event. 
 Back to just loading

                              <span>I am nearing 4,5 years at my current job. It is getting tiresome. We are a small company with a boss with too big an ego. Why? As we are a cloud provider, I must do nearly everything you can imagine. So networking, backup, virtualization, storage, web, Linux, windows, mail, web servers, and the list goes on and on. It is like I do something new every day, even after more than 4 years, it is like I never get to the point I can say, yes, now I am really good at this topic. Besides this I am also doing other jobs here, non-IT related.
 My boss, now, came to the brilliant idea we can also do pen-testing as well. Just like that. Without some outside training. Just search how and do it. Not to mention he also ****** over employees if they leave.
 Oh and the hours, some months they seem without end. Like now...migrate exchange to some open source software. Search, try, implement, test, troubleshoot, document, etc.
 I am getting tired. Next week it is possible I will receive an offer, Linux job, a bit less pay, but better benefits.
 I am also afraid to change, Stockholm syndrome?
 I am tired.

                              <span>Long story very short. I&#x27;ve been a sysadmin since around 1995 in various sectors, even in the past 10 years when I moved into cybersec I&#x27;ve still been in charge of huge chunk of our infrastucture as this was seen as an advantage when we had any incidents - I was familiar with it.
 I&#x27;m moving into a new role in May and while is almost triple my current salary I can&#x27;t help but feel nervous as it&#x27;s completely focused on cybersec, I&#x27;ve taken the jump as frankly I can&#x27;t work under my new boss who&#x27;s just a disaster waiting to happen.
 Any tips? I think it&#x27;s likely impostor syndrome, I was headhunted for this role so I&#x27;m trying to see that as a vote of confidence.
 Perhaps some of this is guilt, since I put my notice in my entire team have quit or are working their notice too so we&#x27;ll be leaving my current employer without a cyber sec team at all (8 staff gone in &lt;2 months).

                              <span>Edit: This post is geared towards those working in Government with air gapped networks.
 I noticed after upgrading to Windows 11 22H2 from Windows 10 20H2/21H2 some vulnerabilities (Nessus) appeared for apps like 3D viewer, Paint 3D and the new Windows Terminal. This is because these are Microsoft Store Apps that require updates.
 If you&#x27;re in an air-gapped environment this proves difficult as everything points to GitHub, third party sites, or a license to get an Appx installer for offline networks. It&#x27;s possible to update these apps but if your workplace is very hard set on risk avoidance instead of remediation you can remove these applications with PowerShell.
 You&#x27;ll need to utilize the Remove-AppxPackage and Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage Cmdlet to &quot;uninstall&quot; the Appx. 
 Nessus showed vulnerabilities for these apps afterwards because the Windows app directory exist for the vulnerable Appx here: C:\Program Files\WindowsApps. You&#x27;ll need to remove the Directory related to the removed Appx. I&#x27;ve only had luck removing these directories by running as SYSTEM via MECM.
 Something to note, if you remove the WindowsApps Appx Directory before running the PowerShell commands above you will not be able to remove the Appx with PowerShell.

                              <span>How do you best secure both the jump host/ jump box and the admin’s credentials?
 These are what I can think of:
 Restrict inbound network access to the jump boxes to only RDP port access from your RDS servers and ports and IP addresses required for AD communication and configuration management.
 Configure AppLocker to restrict software running on the jump boxes.
 Require smart card authentication to login to the jumpboxes.
 Add licenses to the jump boxes so more than 2 admins can login at a time.

                              <span>Hi,
 Im new as sysadmin, and i have checked alot of resources to resolve this but no luck. Hope that you guys can guide me through this step.
 So basically, users cannot install apps without an admin permission. Risk has just raised a point that they are able to download and run portable applications. I have been assigned to block that.
 In our environment, we are using ManageEngine Central, i thought of uaing that to implement this policy, but there was no such option. The optiones offered by GPO is to block specific application installation by either name of hash, i need it to be general for all portable apps.
 I have imported a full list of all applications installed in our environment, thought of creating a whitelist and prohibiting any other application, but no luck in that as well as im not sure which solution to use to enforce this scenario.
 The department is willing to purchase a solution and implement it to control such aspects, as security has a magnificent intrest of the management. Please let me know if any solution provides this capability.
 Thank you

                              <span>Good morning!
 Recently some tickets have been showing up and being escalated to me about users who can&#x27;t open excel spreadsheets on a file share because they are locked by an unknown user. When I check Open Files on the file share I can see who has them open. Well, I asked the user if they could close out of the spreadsheet if they were done and they replied that they didn&#x27;t even have it open. Sure enough there was no lock file in the directory either. If I kill the open file, then another user can open it but this problem repeats itself randomly.
 I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s a share permission or drive permission that&#x27;s causing this but everything looks good... Is there a way to analyze permissions through directory trees (like see an overview of what the user has permissions to do starting from the root of the share) or is this something else entirely? I&#x27;ve googled like a madman and everything just says to remove lock files or close it from Open Files on the server itself.

 a few example include local admins, giving permissions via username and not via security group, misconfiguration, etc...

 Hope this makes sense. Renewed the RootCA cert on a 2 tier install last week.
 I renewed the offline Root CA. No issues here. Took files and copied them over to SubCA and the other server where IIS is running. Did the certutil DSpublish command on the crt file and crl file. Command ran ok and says added to the DS store.
 When I look in pkiview though I have an error on the root level for AIA Location #2. Says Unable to download. The path is correct but it has the old RootCa crt file name listed and not the new one. Everything on the SubCA in PKIView shows OK and the AIA has the new root (3) file listed etc just fine.
 AIA Location #2 Unable to Download http://pki.domain.com/crl/name1(2).crt.crt) and it should be name1(3).crt.
 Both the old RootCA cert (2) and the new (3) exist at that path and I can see them when browsing to that location in a browser and both files will download fine.
 If I go into Manage AD Containers , the new renewed root ca cert shows up under Certificate Authorities Container tab as well as the AIA Container tab correctly. I cannot figure out why everything appears ok, but the file name is not updated in the pki path to the new cert name and it says unable to download. Both the old file (2) and new one (3) have the same permissions.
 What would cause that, and how can I change it? I have done this twice in the past and not encountered this.

 thx

                              <span>Just wondered exactly what is meant in this context by Offline / Online?
 I&#x27;m guessing something to do with VSS snapshots?
 The reason for my question is that a customer is using WSB to backup a VM with an encrypted OS.
 The backup is showing as an Offline backup - I&#x27;m assuming that this machine will not be able to be restored in a running state thus undermining the disk encryption?
 Is an offline backup just a backup of the VHDX not in a running state?
 Thanks

                              <span>Anyone ever done a Unit4 ERP implementation? What’s your impression of the company? What was the process like?
 Currently I’m the IT person on the project team handling SSO and user provisioning and I can wholeheartedly say that they leave a really bad impression in every possible way so far. Their in-house consultants are absolutely clueless and the processes are archaic. I am just in shock after every meeting.
  
You want SSO? Create a ticket and someone in a completely different time zone will not read your request properly and it will take days to sort things out.
 What does the user status “Parked” and “Terminated” mean? No clue. One “consultant” went so far as to suggest to read F1 help - which of course did not help.
 What should be considered when choosing a user ID? Silence.
 Generally they can maybe answer about 10% of the questions, for the rest they need to ask someone else. Sometimes they even get back to you after that.
  
It’s a bit of a nightmare and other departments engaging with different consultants share that feeling. Curious what your experience is. Or does just every ERP implementation suck?

                              <span>Hi everyone, looking for some advice for a small 5 person team, currently only 5 people so far (will expand a little bit but not to much for the next year or so and all using personal laptops at the moment, with a mix of macOS and Windows currently. 
 Here looking for advice on what to do, with an emphasis on security obviously. Should i buy 5 say Dells and centrally manage them with something like InTune. 
 No central office as such and all work remotely, so any recommendation on software for providing remote support like ConnectWise or Bomgar but looking ideally for something not expensive at the moment.

                              <span>Currently in the limbo of having no guidance career-wise and everything being self-directed learning. Was working toward the AZ-104 when I sort of got side tracked with PowerShell and have been focusing on that almost exclusively, currently working through the book &#x27;PowerShell in Action&#x27;, but I have moments of wondering if it&#x27;s a bit overkill since it is a substantially deeper lever than anywhere near what is needed in my environment. 
 Still definitely have AZ-104 on my radar as well as eventually trying to learn Python, as I do not currently know any other languages. 
 My lack of networking knowledge/experience has made me consider pursuing a CCNA, but really I don&#x27;t know if I have an interest in being a networking engineer outside of some of the salaries that I see. 
 I know. It&#x27;s not all about money. But when you are in your early 30s with 2 kids and nothing meaningful saved up for retirement it does start to be about money. Looking for the biggest return on my time investment and am struggling to develop a concrete plan going forward for the next 5-10 years. 
 Please help.

                              <span>BGP novice here. Our growing company will soon be opening a secondary office/datacenter in a different geographic region. Our primary site/headquarters is currently single-homed and uses provider-assigned IP addresses, but will soon be multi-homed and our new site will be multi-homed from day one. Each site will be served by local ISPs that do not operate outside their respective regions. We will be getting full BGP tables from each ISP.
 Each site will have unique IPv6/IPv4 prefixes. There will be VPN tunnels between the two sites, but no direct/dedicated connectivity.
 Would there be any advantages to having a separate ASN for each site? Would there be any disadvantages other than additional RIR fees?
 I am aware of something that Cisco calls &quot;neighbor allow-as&quot;. Would we need to use something like that if the two sites share an ASN, or would the simple fact that they are announcing unique prefixes ensure that their use of a shared ASN doesn&#x27;t get treated as a BGP loop?
 If it matters, we hope to implement RPKI from the start and we wouldn&#x27;t want the secondary site to have a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) that would allow it to announce prefixes used by the headquarters or vice versa. (Such as could happen accidentally due to misconfiguration, or if the site were to suffer a security breach.) My cursory understanding is that we will be able to have distinct ROAs for each site with only the prefixes assigned to that site, but I it would be great if someone could confirm that for me.
 Thanks in advance for any insight!

                              <span>I am looking for the safest way to connect our PDs to a power source. They are POE compatible and the switch on site does provide this but a question has been raised that i cannot find an answer for. 
 - Will we lose power to the devices if there are any issues with the network (not loss of power to the actual switch)
 In addition to this, I was hoping you could help with the best option out of these 3, this would be in addition to requiring a network connection to the devices.
 - Use switch POE
 - Use POE Injector at device location
 - Use standard 24V Power supply for device

                              <span>I have a Fortigate in Azure that shows the following error &quot; virtual machine agent not ready&quot;
 The article below describes how the Fortigate VM may be trying to reach the Azure fabric at 168.63.129.16 incorrectly over an internal port instead of correctly over the external facing port.
 https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGate-Azure-showing-virtual-machine-agent-not/ta-p/214315
 That all makes sense - until the last part of the article. It suggests that if an internal or external load balancer is used ( it is in our case we use both ) then 2 static routes to the Azure fabric are needed - one to the internal port and one to the external.
 We have that in place and still we have an error.
 Thing is i can&#x27;t get my head around why a static route to 168.63.129.16 internal port is needed as well as a static route to 168.63.129.16 over the external port. It makes no sense.
 Any suggestions much appreciated.

                              <span>Having a really weird issue with our old Dell VRTX. For years its been running solid with no issues on 2 M630 blades. We recently purchased a new M640 blade and I&#x27;m working on getting it installed. I had it loaded into slot 3 and was able to get ESXI installed on it with no issues....HOWEVER, when the new blade comes up, blade/hose 2 goes down network wise...and they fight each other for pings. If one is working, the other isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s almost like they have the same ip address(which they don&#x27;t) nor do any of the 4 nics have the same mac address that I can see. 
 It&#x27;s a small network, flat with no vlans, so there&#x27;s no special config R1-2401 vrtx switch.
 Has anyone ever run into this before?

Our WISP uses OSPF for our IGB, but it&#x27;s starting to show it&#x27;s limitations due to the size of our network. It&#x27;s been proposed that we also run BGP, with the variable &quot;Next Hop&quot; set to &quot;Self&quot; Does anyone have any ideas as I&#x27;m struggling to see how this would help, what it would do, etc... Any help explaining this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
 P.S Using MikroTik gear.

                              <span>Due to lack of availability of high-speed (2.5Gb, 10Gbit) small switches with the right combination of features from our usual enterprise brands, it&#x27;s been suggested that we could consider an inversion of sorts, trunking through inexpensive but higher-speed unmanaged switches at the core and still use enterprise PoE+ switches at the edge.
 The idea currently is that all traffic going through the &quot;dumb core&quot; would be VLAN tagged; anything plugging into the core would be VLAN-aware. Besides the edge switches, the core would have at least one NAS and several Macs, for high-speed media sharing workflows.
 As an unusual architecture, I have zero doubt that /r/networking will love it immediately. Assuming that we&#x27;re not going to have any end-users able to plug anything into the core and looping it up, what&#x27;s the pro/con and has anyone run this in production?

                              <span>I recently discovered that there is an entire industry pushing on PoE lighting. Most of it is focused on commercial buildings. I love technology but I&#x27;m struggling to see the benefits. The only thing I&#x27;ve found that is remotely objective is that PoE is low voltage and therefore, does not require conduits to be run for lighting. After factoring the cost of switches and maintenance of switches, Im not sure this is still a benefit. Is there a real benefit to PoE lighting?

Which do you think is in more demand, or will be in more demand and futureproof?

                              <span>The Chinese military conducted military exercises around the island of Taiwan last week after a group of bipartisan lawmakers met with Taiwan’s president. How likely is China to invade Taiwan? What would that invasion consist of? And how would the U.S. react?

As transgender issues become more prevalent  a new study — the largest ever conducted on the issue — concludes there’s good empirical reason to put the brakes on trans treatments for kids.

                              <span>If you use SRP still due to Windows Pro editions, your security rules might not be enforced anymore on some machines. But AppLocker works on any current cumulative update for Win11 and Win10 Pro, even if managed by group policy - it no longer requires Enterprise.
 So this is actually a massive improvement over needing to use SRPs, but Microsoft never really announced SRPs would stop being enforced so it&#x27;s a security risk if you don&#x27;t know to roll out AppLocker.
 The article on AppLocker being enabled for all editions is referring to some older updates but a lot of people are reporting it didn&#x27;t start working until more recently. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5024351-removal-of-windows-edition-checks-for-applocker-e3a763c9-6a3e-4d9c-8623-0ffe69046470

I&#x27;ve been thinking of creating my own portfolio where I show my DHCP, DNS and any other labs I have conducted is there a resourceful tool where I can show this. A friend recommended git hub (he&#x27;s a software engineer) but that seems to be full of coding jargon and such. If anyone has any recommendations It would be highly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi. I have a home server and trying to figure out which way to set it up. This is not server hardware but just a home-built PC with 3x 4tb drives running either 2016 or 2019 essentials. I used to just create a RAID-5 via disk management with NTFS but was wondering if it is better to set up a ReFS pool similar to RAID-5
 My server primarily is used to back up Windows clients and some files.

                              <span>Onboarding a client where we were surprised with a batch of computers in another state. The computers are not domain joined, all the computers have limited users only on them, and no one knows the local admin passwords.
 Connecting remotely just puts us into limited user mode. I&#x27;m trying to come up with a way to gain access without having to fly out and do it manually with a boot tool.
 I&#x27;m not sure I could even step half the users through noting off of USB, but that seems to be the only other option by making a boot USB, shipping it to them, and tailoring it to automatically run the tool to reset the admin password? Anything like that exist?

                              <span>Client of mine has a Dell VRTX that has 2 M630 blades and they&#x27;ve had a 640 blade just sitting around for a while and they&#x27;ve asked me if I could get it installed for them. I told them I&#x27;d take a look at it.
 I slotted in the new blade and saw it&#x27;s firmware was higher than the CMC firmware so the CMC needed to be updated. 
 Got the CMC updated to the latest firmware; however, the internal nics will not come up to allow the blade access to external network. 
 Nics are all enabled on the R1-2401 and I can see blades one and 2 have all of their nics active, but this new blade will not bring them up. I&#x27;ve even gone into the switch an shut/no shut the ports to see if that would bring them up and nadda.
 ​
 Any thoughts? I&#x27;m not very familiar with the old VRTX chassis

I&#x27;ve got adequate PowerShell and batch scripting experience to remove some barriers and increase efficiency and I&#x27;ve got the aptitude to learn a language, but I&#x27;m curious if any of you have picked up an actual programming language like Python or C++, and found that it has taken your sys admin capabilities to another level.
 I&#x27;m envisioning creating things like applets for the support team, or even a website for users that provides some kind of self-service portal (just brainstorming).
 Have any of you learned a programming language and found that it&#x27;s made you a better, more capable sys admin?

                              <span>I work for an MSP in technical sales, my job is to work with potential clients to explain why they need a sysadmin among other things and as a result I directly create openings for IT jobs. I&#x27;m on your side, I know how valuable what you do is. In this sub though I see so much hostility to even relatively non-intrusive sales outreach like emails and LinkedIn here. 
 I don&#x27;t understand why the default assumption is that any cold outreach is not possibly worth considering. I occasionally work with IT directors/managers but usually non-technical decision makers, and typically if I can provide a valid reason for why I wanted to reach out to them, they are happy to hear the 10 second version, provide a maybe or no, then potentially book a meeting.
 I&#x27;m biased, but it seems insane to me to assume anyone who emails you twice should be blocked - how do you know it&#x27;s not a good product or service? Your job depends on sales and marketing too, you wouldn&#x27;t be employed if sales and marketing teams at your company weren&#x27;t pitching plenty of good products and services, the level of vitriol doesn&#x27;t compute to me?

                              <span>TL:DR : Need to migrate more than 3000 DLs to new domain in O365 via PS, how would I do that?
 ​
 Hello Everyone,
 I&#x27;m working on migrating all the DLs of the organisation across all the locations.
 So we have DLs with the domain [admin@oranges.com](mailto:admin@oranges.com) and newly created DLs with [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com) domain.
 I am looking to convert all of them to [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com).
 My plan is :
  
export all the DLs via PS in CSV (How would I do that)
 Remove new DLs (as they are already in the new domain) and teams groups (someone told me it will also show private teams groups).
 Add @ apples.com domain to the DLs.
 Make @ apples.com domain as primary domain.
  
Is it how am I suppose to do or is there any better idea?
 To approximately 50 most used DLs, I migrated them manually, also renamed as it had old company name in the Display name.
 Now I can&#x27;t think of texting individual DL owners to see if they are still in use, so I am just thinking of migrating all of them.
 Please help how would go about this, any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hello I am the sole sysadmin for a mom and pop shop that had massive growth. (i’m a new hire)
 I fixed up the MS365 tenant, did cost optimisation with those licences, set up a proper 3-2-1 Dissaster recovery solution etc.
 Now I want to tackle the self signed certificates (eg. internal documentation webservers, prometheus, grafana, etc)
 my fist idea was to just use the openssl CLI tool, I also checked out the AD CS (seems janky with the web portal only working in IE)
 So my question for you guys is: what do you use to manage your PKI. I’d love to find a tool that make sit easy to manage the certs.
 Thankyou for your help!

 I&#x27;m starting a position with an IT team in a museum soon and I&#x27;m wondering if anybody here has any experience in this exact environment?
 I&#x27;m looking for any prerequisites it&#x27;s be worth me doing or if there&#x27;s anything about working in a museum that&#x27;ll be significantly different from your standard office environment. 
 It&#x27;s primarily working with MS365, Active Directory, ticket management.
 Thanks in advance

 This was confirmed when the functionality was restored after uninstalling KB5025221.
 ​
 I&#x27;m pretty sure scanners and copiers are something that is still used in some office settings so this this information maybe valuable to someone.
 ​
 If you have a brother multi-function printer that includes a document scanner and you keep getting an error scanner is not connecting you can always try removing this update and see if it starts working again for you.

                              <span>Let me say, I am not network smart at all.
 Currently my company advocates for static IP at the printers. We had some printers get moved around and lost their connections. I was told is because the new ports are not on the same subnet. I have no idea what that means but it sounded cool. 
 The other thing that is going on, the network guys want to subnet for printers and other collections. This means we have to re-IP all printers.
 I suggested that we us hostnames/FQDN for printers and it was like I was talking about someone religion, or their parents, or the best motor oil. 
 It seems to me if we go with a standard host naming convention and connected to those printers via FQDN rather than IP, things would run a lot smoother and the network chasers can re-IP all they want. 
 what is/are the best business practices here, short of chaining the printers to the wall?

                              <span>I have been using pingdom from many years and I use their android app to get down notifications. Today I upgraded my phone and saw that they do not have android app anymore. Somehow I missed that. I need following things:- 1.http(s) monitor 2.multiple user support 3.Response time 4.Decent android/ios app with downtime alerts 5.Minimum check interval 1 min
 If anybody can suggest a decent alternative I will really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi guys, I need your help. We have a new building on the way and we will have a huge conférence room... About 22&#x27; by 50&#x27; with a table of 22 places at the center (9 seats each sides and 2 at each extremity). I&#x27;m looking for a conference system (camera, audio, mic, etc) that can be used in this setup.
 I cannot find anything for long rooms... only large and like 8-10 people max and about 25 feet distance max.
 If you have any suggestion, let me know.
 I&#x27;m from Québec province in Canada.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Evening all,
 Wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue and how they approached it. We have a few users who are being constantly locked out by brute force attempts (about 50 attempts every hour). The users have MFA so we aren&#x27;t too concerned about them gaining access but finding it frustrating having to constantly unlock the accounts. We have conditional access policies in place but because the conditional access takes effect after first factor it doesn&#x27;t prevent the lockout. I have reached out to our Contact at Microsoft for some advice also but thought I would check in here as well for any other ideas
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m experimenting with Telnet in a home lab setting, I&#x27;d like to connect to another machine from my main laptop and I&#x27;m having the following issue: I get the message “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”.
 Here is a breakdown.
 ​
  
I want to connect with Laptop 1 to Laptop 2.
 Laptop 1: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.55.
 Laptop 2: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.62.
 Both are connected to the same wireless network.
 When attempting to use Telnet on Laptop 1 to connect to Laptop 2, I get the following message in CMD, with admin privileges, “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”. 
 Telnet client is activated on both machines.
 Firewall settings on Laptop 1 enable me to use Telnet. I tested this and was able to connect to another machine, a Linux laptop, on the same network, without any issue. I totally disabled the firewall on Laptop 2, and I’m still having issues when using Telnet.
 I can connect to Laptop 2 using RDP on Laptop 1.
 Rebooting did not solve the issue.
 
  
Has anyone run into this issue before or have any suggestions? Cheers!

                              <span>TL;DR: setup and monitor the RFC compliant email addresses like Abuse and Webmaster! 
 Long:
 I recently dealt with a website that was compromised. There was a credit card stealer script embedded on the webserver. The script was caught by our antivirus software on a user PC they they went to buy something on this website. My user raised a ticket and I investigated. I knew nothing about this vendor of ours besides the domain. I queried the domain registrar for the owner email address and got the private registration proxy one. Armed with this information I fired a quick email to the following addresses about the security incident:
  
Registrar proxy
 abuse@
 security@
 webmaster@
 hostmaster@
 support@ 
  
The IT team of the vendor resolved the issue and I got a thank you email from them.
 However, of all these, only the webmaster@ address worked, the rest bounced back. I have come across this more frequently as new generation of sysadmins xome onboard, they don&#x27;t know about this. So please, setup an alias or shared mailbox to monitor these accounts!

                              <span>Is hard. Are we the only team, and I suppose all of IT, that gets held to its standards? Seems like whenever someone we supports f’s something up, it’s “well he didn’t know that Mars was in Aquarius so he should have waited until Wednesday” but it you change the border color on your intranet page it’s BLAH BLAH BLAH need a meeting and BLAH BLAH”.
 We are held to policies to the letter but Sara from accounting “Well she has been here for 60 years so it’s ok”.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have a strange case with NTLM.
 I&#x27;ve configured my domain controllers, servers &amp; clients to use LAN Manager Authentication Level : Send NTLMv2 response only, Refuse LM &amp; NTLM.
 I&#x27;ve double checked everything, even in the registry LSA -&gt; Lmcompatibility is 5. 
 If I look into the domain controllers security event viewer, I still see pretty much events with NTLM v1 successful logons (event 4624). I think that this is because of certain computers which aren&#x27;t using the FQDN to connect to a share. 
 I&#x27;m just worried why it still shows me NTLM v1.... All the devices are W10, W11 &amp; W2016 and as I understood, it should enforce NTLM v2.
 Do I miss something ? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;ve installed MIM many times but this will be the first install with a multi server instance (active and standby)
 Ive installed SharePoint on one server. But i need to install Mim on another server. So when trying to install SharePoint. I am trying to connect to the database. But it says I selected a single server farm.
 So my question is. When selecting the role in SharePoint install on initial server. Which option should I select?
 None of the options seem close to what I want.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Im using basic migrationwiz licenses to move from an acquired company to our O365 hybrid tenant. They both sync to AD. I don&#x27;t need to move their domain to ours as they will be using our same domain. I wanted to leave the domain and mx records intact and just foward the email for a week, then worry about moving it later. I can&#x27;t seem to get an answer as to whether I can do a full migration without moving the mxrecords or domain. Anyone else ever do this?

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;ve been trying for a few days to setup a IKEv2 PSK (for simplicity) VPN server. This server should run as a virtual machine on a proxmox deployment. I&#x27;ve disabled proxmox&#x27;s firewall for this specific machine 
 The host is behind a Mikrotik CRS326 router, on which i have configured port forwarding for ports 500 and 4500 UDP to the VPN server (at 192.168.1.7) in the dstnat chain, the firewall rules to allow traffic on those ports via the UDP ports are also in place. 
 The current /etc/ipsec.conf config is this one: 
 config setup
 charondebug&#x3D;&quot;ike 1, knl 1, cfg 0&quot;
 uniqueids&#x3D;no
 ​
 conn ikev2-vpn
 auto&#x3D;add
 compress&#x3D;no
 type&#x3D;tunnel
 keyexchange&#x3D;ikev2
 fragmentation&#x3D;yes
 forceencaps&#x3D;yes
 ike&#x3D;aes256-sha1-modp1024,3des-sha1-modp1024!
 esp&#x3D;aes256-sha1,3des-sha1!
 dpdaction&#x3D;clear
 dpddelay&#x3D;300s
 rekey&#x3D;no
 left&#x3D;%any
 leftid&#x3D;192.168.1.7
 leftcert&#x3D;/etc/ipsec.d/certs/vpn-server-cert.pem
 leftsendcert&#x3D;always
 leftsubnet&#x3D;0.0.0.0/0
 right&#x3D;%any
 rightid&#x3D;%any
 rightauth&#x3D;eap-mschapv2
 rightdns&#x3D;192.168.1.1
 rightsourceip&#x3D;10.20.30.0/24
 rightsendcert&#x3D;never
 eap_identity&#x3D;%identity
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When i try to connect i see exactly one packet on port 500 on mikrotik&#x27;s counter for firewall rules, well, NAT rules in this case and that&#x27;s it, nothing more, the phone i&#x27;m testing this with gives up and states &quot;disconnected&quot;, the whole process take 1-2 seconds. 
 I really have 0 idea what i did wrong.

 Need remote access capabilities for outsourced individuals from South Africa and others to remotely access a US-based private company with such an item as a HyperV Host Server running a GPU on-premise - not necessarily that of Azure/Amazon. 
 Need capacity for 5-8 users to remotely access applications such as AutoCAD Mechanical/Electrical/LT, Adobe Pro, and Office 365. Growth could move to 10-15 users. 
 Drawings will come from the local file server. The present jobs server is 2TB+.

                              <span>Hey all
 I am working on an assignment which basically has the question of identifying an exploit with a relevant CVE that would allow for TCP session identification. The closest I could find to this was CVE-1999-0667 with ARP spoofing, where the cache is poisoned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
 I am however confused, as I do not know if this constitutes as an exploit or just a technique within an exploit. I tried my hardest to skim through thousands of CVEs to see if there were any exploits related to the identification of TCP sessions, but most of them were just denial-of-service attacks.
 I would appreciate some clarification on this topic because I am just so lost

                              <span>I have a 7606-S with RSP720 that had an ESM card (7600-ES20-GE3C). In the process of replacing it with a 7600 ES+ card (76-ES+XC-20G3C) I had both in the chassis and pretty much copy pasted the config for each interface in use and unplugged the cables and SFPs from the old card and plugged them into the new one.
 Apr 15 10:24:24 EST: %TRANSCEIVER-3-OPER_ENABLE_FAILURE: Detected for transceiver module in GigabitEthernet4/10, module disabled 
 Some SFPs were disabled. A few SFPs, I only noticed after I took another look at them are actually DS-SFP-GE-T, not SFP-GE-T.
 I added service unsupported-transceiver and no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid, but it made no difference.
 Is there no workaround for this? In the first place, what is DS-SFP-GE-T?? It doesn&#x27;t show up in the Cisco transceiver compatibility tool, DS makes me think mds9000 maybe? But it worked without complaint in the older linecard while it won&#x27;t work even with unsupported-transceiver in the ES+ one. 
 Right now I have both still installed until I probably end up getting the right SFPs, wondering if this was to be expected, on switches the hidden commands pretty much let you use any standard SFP with a scary warning prompt but on this platform it didn&#x27;t even show me the warning, though it didn&#x27;t have any effect either.

                              <span>It needs to be IOS XR.
 It needs to be 1RU.
 It needs to have at least 1 10G port, ideally 2. Expansion modules are fine too.
 Refurbished and even EoL is fine.

                              <span>I recently had an issue on one of my brand new fibre 9500 stacks where I was losing packets on multiple interfaces but predominately 1 link agg. I knew that one of the redundant power cables had come loose but as this was a major switch 2k users were passing through, not to mention public facing infrastructure, I put that aside while I tried every single thing I could think of to fix the 40% packet loss on a major interface (we were also getting minor packet loss on other interfaces but I didn’t find out till late in the troubleshooting process) when I finally had given up I was about to get Cisco TAC and out vendor support involved. As I was waiting on the phone for support I plugged in the redundant power into a less loose pdu and BAM!!! no packet loss across the board. Is this an rma issue or have I missed something?

                              <span>I am working on some homework question which asks how one would conduct a scan of a target network through IP obfuscation whilst seeing enough information about a port.
 I get that a SYN/ACK would be used in this case over a proxy server, but is that it? I am unsure if I am missing an extra step here, but from what I understand, the target host replying with its on SYN/ACK confirms it is alive. After this, I do not know if the scanner host would send a RST or an ACK to the target network.

                              <span>We’re seeing random packet loss sporadically throughout the day on both WAN 1 and WAN 2 around similar times.
 I know this is zero information to go on, but is it possible that there is an issue where the ISPs connect to the building (we’re in a large office building)? I’m not sure what else would cause a similar packet loss at similar times from 2 different ISPs

                              <span>Hi all, just at wanted to sanity check myself and see if anyone has similar / any suggestions on quotes you may or may have received from cisco or your reseller to see if they are yanking my chain. Working with a new var on upgrading an asr9910, requirements for the card ports are 6 40 gig ports and a handful of 10 gig with the possibility of upgrading two 40 gig ports to 100. A quote for a a9k-8hg-flex-fc was coming out to 174k per card with a 177k license per card for a 400g license which seems high. An original quote for a 400g line card with the bare minimum ports was about 60k each and 60 for the license. Is this just obnoxiously high or just cisco? Anyone have similar quotes from juniper or nokia? Those would be a full chassis quote at this point. The total bw on the backplane doesn’t go above 200g with a potential of upgrading to 3-340g.

Qty is of course a variable as number of devices increases time needed to implement a complete swap so let&#x27;s just assume six devices, two core, two distro, two access switches.
 You already have procured the replacements and they are sitting in your storage.
 How long from receiving the roster to replacement should it roughly take to accomplish?

                              <span>Over the years, I&#x27;ve seen many debates about the value of certs.
 Just 3.5 months into my full-time career, I&#x27;ve landed a &#x27;Senior Network &amp; Security Analyst&#x27; role, and I believe truly having my CCNA helped A TON.
 First off, the last thing I&#x27;m trying to do here is brag/gloat. This is an anonymous forum and no-one knows me here. Simply trying to share my experience so that it can hopefully help others.
 For background, I have 1 year (three 4 month co-ops) internship experience, and have been working at my full time role for 3.5 months.
 Before anyone says anything about the &#x27;validity&#x27; of the role/company, my new company is a huge employer and big bank.
 I understand this is Reddit and you should take my post with a grain of salt. You might have huge skepticism over if this is a true post or not.
 Luck/timing plays a big role. Clearly I don&#x27;t have &#x27;senior&#x27; level experience, but I do interview well, do have some work experience, but most importantly, I have my CCNA and DevNet, along with some network automation projects I listed on my resume (and no, not just simple projects from school. These are my own individual projects). I believe these factors were a massive help in me landing the role (the role said CCNP would be a nice-to-have and that automation experience was a plus).
 Another myth I want to shatter is about applying to jobs &#x27;out of your league&#x27;. Again, by all accounts I should not have landed the role as I am only 3.5 months into my full-time career. But clearly there weren&#x27;t too many eligible candidates and my new employer is deciding to take a chance on me.
 So just apply to any and every job that catches your eye. And there is absolutely no arbitrary &#x27;time&#x27; you have to stay at a job before you want to move. I am the proof.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on upgrading our switches to IBNS 2.0 config and up till now I&#x27;ve had little to no issues.
 We have mostly 3850s with a handful of 9XXX series switch&#x27;s and just a few 2960c&#x27;s
 I think I&#x27;m running into a bug with these ones. We have the port template use a parked vlan (666) and we do vlan assignment via ISE policy. When I try to do this on this switch it seems to tear down the mab session and repeat it forever. ISE logs show repeated successes and the debugs show successful vlan, dacl and SGT assignment but then immediately tear down and start over. My work around has been to just blow out the template onto the port statically as well as set the vlan statically everything works fine if I do that. and I&#x27;m fine with keeping it that way for now. However I&#x27;d still like to know. I&#x27;m likely to put in a tac case today but I&#x27;d figure I&#x27;d share in case anyone else is in my boat. 
 I&#x27;ve got a switch on my desk with more or less the same config and I&#x27;m unable to replicate the issue at least most of the time. Although I don&#x27;t have 100% the same endpoints to test with.
 anyway here is the switch facts:
 WS-C2960C-8PC-L 15.2(7)E7 C2960c405-UNIVERSALK9-M

                              <span>Just wondering what the preferred setup for this is. We currently have a DMZ that is all on one VLAN. I got the directive to prevent east/west. The two easiest solutions I could come up with are switch it to a PVLAN or setup the host firewalls and just block traffic from the DMZ subnet. Harder solution would be split the VLAN up which would require readdressing the servers.
 Since I don&#x27;t manage the servers, I think the PVLAN is the best solution I could implement. Anyone have their DMZ setup like this? Any downsides or concerns I may be overlooking? Most use-cases I see when researching are for segmenting customer traffic or guest networks.

                              <span>Help with identifying daily jobs i deem normal but may be used in a pay raise.
 What are some of the jobs/things/operations you do on a daily/weekly/monthly basis and deem as standard or normal that would be a reason for a pay raise.
 Im bad at explaining this but i need bullet points i can hit with so that i can argue why i need a raise. 
 I do all the normal stuff a ~10000 user networking engineer/professional does, but im looking at things i might have overlooked but can be classified as specialized work.
 I feel like this is harder than nessecary, as daily upkeepings and tickets keeps rolling in they dont nessecarily keep increasing in complexity, but the hole of everything still gets expanded daily. 
 Again. Just looking at pointers and maybe even normal operations that may be deemed as things to be taking with me in negotiations in the next conversation.
 ANY reply is welcomed.

                              <span>This is probably a silly question, but I can&#x27;t find the answer online for the life of me...
 We just got a fancy new Fluke LinkIQ network tester. When we do a PoE test with it, we get two results: HW Class and Software Negotiated Class. The HW Class usually shows Class 3 and the SW Class shows Class 4. What is the difference between the two and why is one Class 3 and the other Class 4?
 The Fluke documentation just says:
  
The hardware negotiated power class (Class 0 to Class 8) of the PSE device.
  
and
  
The software negotiated power class (Class 1 to Class 8) of the device.

The remote site was experiencing packet loss. Network team looked at the interfaces on both sides for errors but nothing apparent was accumulating. Optical signals TX and RX levels looked “within range” and no alarms were displayed on either side of the link. The link was stable, had not been flapping, and everything seemed normal. Its been up and operational for over a year.

                              <span>Hoping for some feedback here as I&#x27;m pretty much out of ideas for figuring out what the problem is here. I have a 4G LTE testbed network that I&#x27;m trying to do some performance testing on. The network essentially looks like this. I&#x27;ve trimmed out some of the extraneous devices to simplify things, hopefully this makes sense as I&#x27;m hardly an expert.

 The problem
 iPerf tests initiated from a LAN client to a RAN server always show the same weird output, mostly 0s.

                              <span>Hi wonderful Reddit community! I am in IT but not in networking specifically. I was hoping someone smart here could help me with the puzzle I have.
 Preface: Long time ago a very experienced networking engineer told me to never run a single ping packet. This is because, even aside of packet drops, there could be some other problems (if I recall correctly, related to ARP resolution) that may fail connection on the first ping, but succeed on subsequent ones.
 Some facts (all of this is true with default parameters): * When in Windows I ping something it runs 4 pings. * When in Linux I ping something it pings continuously. * When in PowerShell I use Test-Connection it runs 4 pings. * When in PowerShell I use Test-NetConnection it runs one ping (validated with WireShark).
 Question: Can someone tell me if that networking engineer was right?
 Bonus question: If that networking engineer was right, does that mean that Test-NetConnection is a bad command?
 (Please don’t dig deep into command parameters, ports etc. - the question is about icmp)

We moved into a shared office space with another business, we are both using Shaw as our provider, me with the business plan and them with the home plan. As soon as I arrive at the office and connect to our company WiFi me and the guy across from me (other business) start dropping connection. Sometimes we drop connection a few times a day, sometimes I can only maintain connection for 2-3 minutes at a time, dropping connection intermittently. Our SSID&#x27;s are on different channels, and our modems are both running through the same coax cable with a splitter. My company is running a Meraki for WiFi with the modem bridged, they are connecting directly to their modem. Does anyone have any idea why our WiFi would be interfering with each other?

 Would like switches with BGP, VXLAN and EVPN. Budget is +- € 1500,- for each switch.

 Arista DCS-7150S-24-F (Intel FM6000 asic) 24x 10 Gbit) € 1450,-
 Arista DCS-7280SE-64 (Arad asic) 48x 10 Gbit + 4x 40 Gbit) € 1500,-
 ​
 Cisco N5k-C5672UP (Cisco UPC) €1200,- ENHANCED_LAYER2 , Lan base + lan enterprise license included
 Cisco N5K-C56128P (Cisco UPC) € 1200,- ENHANCED_LAYER2 , Lan base + lan enterprise license included.
 Juniper QFX5100 maybe, but cannot find it with the layer3 licenses.
 A former colleague say that for VXLAN it is best to stay away from the Nexus 5k series.
 ​
 Anyone have any ideas/tips? Which ASIC chipset are recommended for VXLAN/EVPN (within budget)?

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 Sorry if this isn&#x27;t quite the right sub for this post. I have a question about a setup I came across at a small business. I didn&#x27;t set it up, but the current setup doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me so I&#x27;d like some help understanding.
 The business has two DSL connections. The first one is their internet connection. 
 The second one is just creating a secure connection to a remote server that they need to access. The remote server they are accessing is at 100.100.0.1. This DSL modem is expecting a client to connect on port LAN4 at a client IP of 100.50.50.254, with a default gateway of 100.50.50.1. If I connect my laptop to LAN4, assign a static IP of 100.50.50.254, and a default gateway of 100.50.50.1, I can ping 100.100.0.1 no problem. That all makes sense. 
 They are using a Cisco RV042G as their primary Router/Firewall. This router has a WAN port and a WAN/DMZ port. Currently it is configured in WAN + DMZ mode. 
 The WAN port is connected to their first DSL modem, the modem is in Bridge Mode, and the router is setup to login using PPPoe. All internet traffic is routed through this connection.
 In the settings for the DMZ port, it has the option to select a subnet or range. Subnet is selected, and an IP of 100.50.50.254 is inputted in there. There is then a static route setup for 100.100.0.1, to be routed out the DMZ Interface. 
 My understanding is the DMZ port as configured is supposed to be used to give a direct internet connection to a specific device, keeping it seperate from your LAN, and bypassing all firewall rules. 
 But how it is being used is more like a dual WAN setup, with no Failover or Load Balancing, but where all internet traffic is routed out one WAN port, and only specific traffic is routed out the second WAN port. 
 Can anyone help clear up what is going on here, and what would be the preferred way of setting this up? Thanks,

                              <span>Our telecom team is moving off of our old on-prem VoIP and going to a cloud hosted solution. We tried to future proof ourselves years ago so we have ample campus bandwidth (small user count, 10G everywhere, DC and user traffic totally separated) so we never had a real reason to try and shoot ourselves in the foot with a bad QoS policy - but now with projects winding down we all collectively decided that now is a good time to take a look at it.
 I&#x27;ve been going through Cisco Live&#x27;s breakout sessions and am starting to get a grasp, but the whole &quot;cloud hosted VoIP&quot; piece is throwing a wrench in my machine. Below are the guidelines that I&#x27;m trying to follow:
  
Marking DSCP as close to the source as possible - We&#x27;re moving off of Cisco phones, so part of my testing is to use &quot;auto qos voice trust&quot; and see if the DSCP values stick with non-Cisco phones at the access port level, not just uplinks.
 QoS policies in hardware, not software
 Specifically call out VoIP as EF/AF46/COS5
  
Where I&#x27;m really lost is the cloud bit. As far as I know, ISPs don&#x27;t give a toss about your DSCP markings and we aren&#x27;t peering directly with this cloud service, so while the QoS that we haven&#x27;t needed before would (well, might if we dont mess it up) work internally, all this work is going to be for nothing if we ship VoIP packets out into the wild internet and they get trampled.
 Is this just part of the known risk when going to a cloud service? I&#x27;ve asked for some technical documentation from them and we will have meeting where I can pepper them with questions, I&#x27;m just trying to get my ducks in a row and not be an IT dinosaur. 
 VoIP in the cloud, exciting times.
 Quick edit, I&#x27;m heavily leaning on this Cisco Live BRKCRS-2501 session and have a QoS book queued up in O&#x27;Reilly Books that I&#x27;ll chew on over the next month

 We want the SFPs that we order to be re-codeable with any sfp programmer without knowing the password.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m goin to have to clean a lot of vlans from around 10 Cisco Catalyst switches with IOS-XE, and I&#x27;m wondering what would be the best way to do so, a bit of introduction, some of em are in RSTP domain but not all, some of em aren&#x27;t declared in vlan db anymore but still on the &quot;allowed trunk&quot; list in interfaces. 
 I&#x27;d like to automate it as much as possible, and i was looking at ntc-templates, the main process should be 
  
I decide i need to eliminate vlan 333
 Find, hopefully with some kind of automation, every port where the vlan is explicitly allowed but not the trunk all ports
 &quot;no vlan 333&quot;
 &quot;no spanning-tree vlan 333&quot;
 for every interface found at point 2, do &quot;switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 333&quot; still, with some kind of automation
 
 I&#x27;m no expert with ansible, ntc-templates and so on, but I like to get shits done in the most efficient wave, and I&#x27;m willing to invest a bit of time in this cause for sure it&#x27;ll spare a ton of time for me and my team in the future, so, what are your suggestions to do this kind of thing in the most efficient way? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I do not have Administrator rights on my workstation.
 I have a situation where my main Adapter is split up to one Tagged adapter and one Untagged adapter.
 The Tagged adapter and Untagged adapter have IPv4 configurations.
 The main Adapter has IPv4/6 disabled. This is standard with the Intel PROSet configuration tool.
 Now the problem is when updates are pushed to this workstation, the two &#x27;sub&#x27;Adapters (the tagged and untagged ones with ip config) dissapear and are deleted.
 The main adapter is working but has IPv4 configuration disabled. Thus logging in becomes impossible and I need to bother the Administrator.
 Windows 10 Enterprise.
 Enabling IPv4 is not allowed on the main adapter after the intel tooling created subadapter(s).

The router has Dhcp, NAT etc configured nothing major. However, what I tried recently was creating separate VRFs, one for the Customer and the second for the Management of the router. This was done to ensure to segregation of the routing tables of customer and management. 
 Now while deploying I was wondering, what are the pros and cons of creating VRFs in this scenario. What could be the possible downside of creating such a setup ? Appreciate your help and expertise, thanks in advance.

I am looking for a 10/25/100 Gbps capable switch and Mikrotik seems to do all of that and more for very little cost. I don&#x27;t really need any bell or whistle since we only have a single server rack to make use of this switch. This will be for the backend communication between the servers and backup appliances. Simple config and some vlan. I mainly looking at this to speed up our backup and not to mention this switch cost less than our 1 Gps switch. 
 Do the networking community feel this switch is reliable enough for a small office?

And you guessed it, no password logs anywhere. I see that there is a process with a serial cable to reset the admin password but it also notes that it erases the data on the system. I have been asked to retrieve some of the data on this unit so I don’t think I should do that. Does anyone know of any other options? 
 Also, I cant seem to find any technical documentation on this unit. With the WD and DDN acquisitions I have no idea where to get any documentation….. or what support number I can call. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>As the title suggest, I’m looking for an alternative for WSUS. In the last 24hrs I’ve been fighting the console along with other menial tasks that come along with the platform. I finally came to terms to just blow the install all away to start fresh again. I’ve been working with WSUS for the last 6yrs now with plenty of headaches I’d like to get rid of. So I’m reaching out to find some other patch management suggestions. We are a small business, I’m sure we can manage about 5k/yr but I’m trying to find something a little lower on the cost side if any. Also, if the solution could inventory the machines and present what patches are needed by machines (similar to WSUS), that would be a bonus. So what do you all have for me?

                              <span>Microsoft seems to be testing the waters with this announcement, with some sort of phased reveal - it&#x27;s only visible in one of the three tenants I have access to. The link, if you have it, is https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?ref&#x3D;MessageCenter/:/messages/MC541626 If you don&#x27;t have it, here are the screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/qVMQxbl
 Basically it&#x27;s a new feature coming where when you click a link in an email in Outlook on Windows, it opens Edge with a copy of the email as a side panel. Sounds kind of neat.
 But to make sure everyone experiences this, Outlook will also start ignoring your system&#x27;s default web browser and opening links in Edge no matter what. Users whose default has always been Chrome, and whose bookmarks and saved passwords are all in Chrome, will be highly confused by a very similar-looking browser that has none of their stuff. They&#x27;ll probably call the helpdesk screaming &quot;why did you delete all my stuff?!?!&quot;
 The user can change this in settings, but options being offered for admins to shut this off is lacking. Both options listed (the cloud policy service and group policy) explicitly apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (not business).
 So, for SMBs there seems to be no way out besides manually touching each machine. Of course, it remains to be seen if perhaps the end-user setting is in a registry key instead of some secret place... we can only hope...

                              <span>Having odd issues with PXE and DHCP while setting up WDS. Happened to pull up what is supposed to be the secondary DHCP server and it appears it&#x27;s not a secondary but configured for an extended scope of the primary. And failover is not configured. Great. Also the IP pool is exhausted and I see my test machine on there. NO WONDER I&#x27;M HAVING ISSUES!!!! Pretty sure this was set up by their MSP too which is comforting.
 What is the worst skeleton you&#x27;ve ever found hiding in the environment during or after a merger?

                              <span>I just left a very stressful job because it was eating me alive mentally and beginning to do so physically. This is a company that has very, very few people leave and many come back after doing so. I just can&#x27;t escape a feeling of shame for not being able to make it. It wasn&#x27;t the work, it was a few people that saw me as their personal Easy Button. I tried to get my manager to separate me from them but they wouldn&#x27;t do so. Is it irrational to think that I failed?

To fix the problem we have been rebooting the servers which fixes the problem for at least a day.
 Digging into the event viewer we found that the app readiness services was timing out after about 30 seconds if someone left the black screen up long enough without killing the remote session. 
 These servers have been running for over a year without ever having this problem and the problem has cropped up randomly across about 10 servers now.

                              <span>Last week my employer (a large robotics company) hired an MSP to work as our help desk. We had a different MSP for 10 years but due to some contract negotiation differences, we could not come to an agreement. The new MSP needed Jump boxes in the environment to use as administration systems to work from. 
 ​
 They requested 18 boxes 1 for each person. the box requested was a server 2016+ and local admin rights plus rights to have basic administration of DNS, DHCP, etc. We provided the boxes and the accounts. 
 ​
 Today (yay Friday!) I happen to refresh my server manager and find a few new ADCS boxes. So I looked at all servers on the network to find what roles were installed. I found many jump boxes had ADCS, ADFS, ADDS, DHCP, DNS, and ADLDS. etc. Many even had LDS instances. 
 ​
 I contacted the Helpdesk manager and asked why these servers have these roles installed when they are only meant for jump boxes and they didn&#x27;t follow the documented change management process. 
 He then proceeded to respond &quot;We needed these so we could administrate these services on the servers,&quot; I asked him why they didn&#x27;t use RSAT because installing these roles leaves the environment up to more risks. He seemed surprised at the existence of RSAT. 
 ​
 I am very frustrated that the MSP would install and configure critical roles on jump boxes in the environment but I am also Dumbfounded that the basic tools for administration seemed to be unknown to them and it makes me question their knowledge. They to me seem to be a huge risk at this point. 
 ​
 Would it be a deal breaker for anyone here? Would you cancel the contract?

 The vast majority of users send MAYBE 1 ticket a week, and are very relaxed but in any company I have worked for there is always a small handful of individuals who have an issue every other day. its always an emergency and the ticket is so vague that you always have to spend 4 emails just to figure out what the problem is.
 The week started with it was &quot;Excel not working&quot; &lt; The application was working fine, the issue was that they incorrectly formatted an excel formula. 
 Wednesday (8am): &quot;Cant connect, please assist&quot; &lt; Turns out they decided to WFH, knows damn well we disable VPN accounts inactive for 2 weeks, and neglected to advise us. 
 Thursday it was: &quot;My computer isn&#x27;t working, tried restart&quot; &lt; This one was actually an issue, But I checked task manager and they did not reboot the machine, in 5 days. A reboot fixed the issue
 just now, Friday 4PM &quot;The scanner needs to be cleaned&quot; *send PHOTO of a screen with a notification* saying &quot;IF your scanned doc has vertical lines it needs to be cleaned&quot;. 22 minutes later I am still waiting to see a document that has vertical lines. The scanned document is FINE...
 The most hilarious part of this is they claim to have taken a post secondary I.T course.
 Have a good weekend everyone

                              <span>Hello All,
 Our current environment is Windows Server and laptop based using local AD synced to Azure and Exchange Online.
 My co-worker in IT, which also turns out to be a middle manager, wants to transition the company (small to medium sized) from Windows based laptops to Chromebooks. My co-worker believes there will be less maintenance of the devices themselves such as constantly dealing with driver issues (Dell), plus they&#x27;re much cheaper. 
 Obviously we&#x27;d have to virtualize any app so it can be accessible through a browser, which only would be a couple or so, and we&#x27;d have to start managing the devices via MDM. We would keep Exchange Online and Azure for email and authentication. 
 I&#x27;m trying my hardest to keep an open mind about this as I do not want to be a hinderance to new ideas, and this would fall mostly on me to make this transition happen, at least infrastructure wise.
 I would just like to know what any of y&#x27;all think of the idea of transitioning to Chromebook based laptops/tablets.

                              <span>With the new Windows LAPS implementation everything is working smoothly except one thing I can&#x27;t figure out. If I set my &quot;Configure authorized password decryptors&quot; gpo to use a group like mydomain\LAPS Admins when I run Get-LapsADPassword it tells me I&#x27;m unauthorized to decrypt the password even though I&#x27;m in that group. If I instead set the gpo to mydomain\myuser instead of the group it works fine, but then my other admins can&#x27;t decrypt though, anyone else run into this issue and know a fix?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies, it was just another case of being impatient. Went and did something else for 30 minutes or so and checked again and I could read the password fine with the group assignment.

 I&#x27;ve primarily been a JOAT admin, and have worked mostly with Cisco networking gear over the past 10 years or so. PAN firewalls seem pretty awesome when coupled with all the ($$) extra licensing, but is a bit overwhelming as i am still coming up to speed with the way they &#x27;do&#x27; things. 
 Anyone here done the same migration? any gotchas i should be watching out for?
 Happy Friday!

                              <span>Whats your biggest reason when you set up a NIC teaming?
 (for instance, teaming 2 NICs for a vmware vSwitch)
 Speed? Reliability? Load balancing for some reason?
 The reason i ask is that i have teamed NICs for the vSwitches in a few esx servers, but mostly because thats how it was set up on the first esx server i saw.
 I dont think that teaming two 1gbit NICs gives much better speed (for me, here).
 Both NICs are connected to the same switch, and the router mostly only has 1gbit NICs anyway, so i dont think much traffic would go over that limit anyway.
 And yeah, both NICs are connected to the same switch, so if that breaks its bye bye anyway.
 But yeah, i get some redundancy if one port on that dual-port card breaks i guess.
 Anyway, when you team NICs, do you always make sure they are connected to separate switches?
 And what more to think of?

                              <span>hoping someone can help me with this one!
 Identicly deployed the 365 apps for enterprise to roughly 25 RDS session hosts via ODT, all working fine bar one host which is refusing to activate any users licence, after signing in with an appropriately licenced user or users I still get the big dirty &#x27; (non commercial use) (unlicenced Product)&#x27; across the top.
 ​
  
I can&#x27;t see any firewall issue, local windows firewall is disabled like the other hosts, and I can&#x27;t see anything stopping the traffic, it is in the same network as the other working session hosts.
 I have tried usual reinstall/repairs both online and offline.
 Redeploy via ODT again it installs again ok but fails to activate.
 tried clearing credential manager.
 Tried running the support and recovery assitant tool.
 https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-for/29323f9a-899b-4d08-b21d-ca697c7594c0
 running the clean up scripts provided by MS:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/activation/reset-office-365-proplus-activation-state#sectionb
 Verified the registry value for shared licensing is set to 1.
 I am able to get to the sign in prompt, but it doesn&#x27;t go anything with the creds, no username is registered so I can returned the sign in option again.
  
​
 Just wondering if anyone has come accross a really obscure answer to this one?
 ​
 Any suggestions appreciated!

                              <span>Suddenly throughout the Enterprise I have users complaining that Sticky Notes have disappeared from their systems? I know for a fact we were using them, because I&#x27;ve used them for months &amp; suddenly over the last 2 weeks we&#x27;re seeing intermittent users losing them? They appear to have completely been removed from systems, &amp; for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out how or why? This is happening with our Physical systems &amp; VDI&#x27;s yet some people still have them? We&#x27;ve made no major changes to the environment, besides Windows patches (22H2). 
 We are using Microsoft M365 W/Azure &amp; some cloud features but NOT using OneDrive. Is it possible someone in Engineering was in the back-end console &amp; removed or turned off Sticky Notes? Are sticky notes even part of M365?

                              <span>OK this is going sound like a really dumb question.. I’ve been running hyper V for over 15 years successfully and I don’t have any issues with it
 My question is, is, can you install hyper V in such a way that you don’t have the entire windows OS under it? That way all you’re running is hyper V on the bare metal with all of the VMs under it. (Dell Servers) 
 It’s just something I’ve never researched or known if it’s possible 
 To be honest, I’ve never installed the server OS without the GUI.
 I’m just really admitting my ignorance I’m just curious. To see if there’s a better way sometimes it seems like a waste to have the full OS just sitting there doing nothing when hyper V is doing 99% of the work on the post.

                              <span>Hi does anyone know if a server 2016 on prem running exchange can be hybrid Azure AD joined? 
 (I’m not talking about hybrid exchange) 
 I am in the process of onboarding servers to MDE and noticed that our exchange server is not listed in Azure AD as a device. Running dsregcmd /status shows it’s only joined to ADDS, it’s OU is part of the Azure AD connect sync, issue seems to be it will not add certs to the local personal cert store and Workplace Join task exits with 0x1 response. 
 I can’t find documentation if an exchange server can be joined like this. Because it does not show in Azure it means I can assign it to the Azure AD group for MDE settings. 
 Anyone got any ideas ? Thanks.

                              <span>Morning! 
 We recently installed a NUC11TNBV7 device in a room with a NEC monitor. To connect the device to the monitor we had to use a USB C to displayport cable. 
 The NUC displays an image when first turned on, but if the monitor is power cycled, the image stays black, and eventually the monitor will go back to sleep since it&#x27;s not receiving an image. 
 I&#x27;ve updated the thunderbolt drivers, the bios, and the VGA drivers in the NUC but nothing seems to work. I&#x27;ve checked the power plan settings on the device as well as adjusting to maximum performance in the BIOS. 
 Interesting enough, unlike the other nucs in the room, when you vnc into the device with the monitor off it shows the full 1920x1080 and a monitor connected, while the older nucs revert to 800x600 and no monitor connected. 
 Due to the configuration of this room, using the HDMI out of the NUC is currently not an option. My next step will be to order an active HDMI to displayport cable. 
 Our NUC10&#x27;s have no issue using USB-C to DP. I&#x27;m Curious if anyone else has any experience with USB-C display out issues with these NUC11 and if you have a solution.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I&#x27;m doing some network segmentation while installing our new servers, and my plan was to have the firewall do traffic inspection (AV filtering, ect) on the traffic between those vlans. We have a pair of Fortigate 200Fs.
 Is this standard practice for you guys? Or do you just enable routing and be done with it?

                              <span>Hello everyone ! I hope you have a better read only Friday than me ! 
 One of our domain controller which is physical computer installed in a other site far away from my office, has no trust relation with our Active Directory, so it’s impossible for us to access it anymore. It happened after a “little” mistake was made. Basically this server is gonna be replaced and we need to clone it and redeploy it on a new VM in our hyperV cluster, for a specific software installed on it. So the clone was done, using disk2vhd cloning C: of that server, and mounted on a new VM, the new vm wasn’t connected with network until the IP was changed, but to change the name of that new VM, it was needed to downgrade the VM from DC to non DC, and to do this it had to be connected to the network, and it’s at that moment where we had the conflict, which made our physical machine loose the trust relationship and removed itself from our AD.
 Has anyone of you an idea on how to make the physical server re join our AD and being able to connect on it ? Beside going physically on site where the server is located which is a 6 hour drive from office. We can’t connect with any AD account because no trust relation, and no local account possible because it’s a domain controller.
 Sorry for my bad English, not my native language,

Basically i have a file that updates every 2 minutes with ip&#x27;s that change and i need a way to monitor them so i dont get false alarms when an ip is removed. So i would get something like ICMP ping failed for 10.10.10.19 or smthng like that if the ip is down and not when its removed.

                              <span>So hi,
 i am somewhat lost about how to proceed here.
 for as long as i can remember, i had no problem to propagate a specific website as startpage/homepage via policy, including those that are defined as &quot;preferred&quot; or &quot;not locked&quot;, be it either per group policy for edge &amp; chrome, or policies.json in Firefox.
 what exactly happens when a new policy, defined as &quot;preferred&quot; or &quot;not locked&quot; is applied, but a different setting already exists for a user?
 because all of sudden, i am getting a heap load of complaints, that for two different customers, and two different browsers (edge &amp; firefox), the browser does not load the correct new startpage we have set per policy. for one customer, in edge it&#x27;s set per GPO and for the other customer, in firefox it&#x27;s set via policies.json.
 for firefox i was able to verify, one user has the old homepage set in his profile prefs.js. when i remove this, the policy applies as it should. the user didn&#x27;t change anything homepage related on his end, he doesn&#x27;t even touch firefox at all as he prefers edge. all users i talked to assert they have not set another homepage, and still there seem to be some user-specific changes to said setting. is there any way a differing setting could end up in the user-specific settings by other means?
 anyways, it appears the per-user-setting has priority. did this behaviour change recently? because i can&#x27;t remember i&#x27;ve ever had this much trouble with policies like these before, and since 1-2 month ago, an alarming amount of people report this problem...

 The other systems don&#x27;t have ANY logs related to SeBackupPrivilege. Anyone have any ideas on what might be happening? So far my searches have turned up nothing useful.
 For reference, in a 24 hour period, the unaffected systems generate about 76,000 Security Log events - whereas the affected system is about double that, and the extra 76,000 are all related to SeBackupPrivilege.
 I will not be able to provide any actual logs due to the company policy, but still hope someone has some ideas on what it could be.

                              <span>There is a great deal of user-generated content out there, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos, but we&#x27;ve generally tried to keep that off of the front page due to the volume and as a result of community feedback. There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!
 In this thread, feel free to show us your pet project, YouTube videos, blog posts, or whatever else you may have and share it with the community. Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, or links that appear to be monetization-grabs will still be removed.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve come across a weird issue this morning with machines running M365 current channel. We&#x27;ve tested this on some of our machines running the latest build, 16227.20280. Checking for updates through any of the apps, it will start to download an apply an update. Once this has completed, M365 is downgraded to the build that was released on March 20th, 16130.20332.
 We&#x27;re able to manually update back to the latest build by using the C2R updater and referencing the build number: &quot;C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe&quot; /update user updatetoversion&#x3D;16.0.16227.20280
 Going through the GUI update process will again downgrade it to 16130.20332.
 Checking our registries, we can see that in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration, the &quot;VersionToReport&quot; key references the latest build. My assumption is that this entry is used when checking for updates.
 So, maybe some funny business at Microsoft&#x27;s end this morning? Anybody else experiencing this?

                              <span>We have an issue with certain users with GPO mapped drives that randomly disconnects with the Event ID 4106 in the Application log.
 At the moment these network shares are DFS shares, adding this info in case it is useful, so we go to \corp\DFS_SHARE\folder, to access folders on different servers.
 We have had very limited success on finding the cause, but the issue occurs several times a day, has anyone here dealt with this issue and have some idea of where to look.
 We have looked at the FW, but can&#x27;t really see any relevant events.

 These indians do not in any way understand the problem at hand, completely ignore my answers to their questions and the problem description presented to them.
 They just ask absolutely irrelevant, off topic questions that have nothing to do with the problem and seem to have no idea of the products they &quot;support&quot;. 
 How do I escape this?
 How can I get actual help? 
 I always had a stereotype of thinking MS Support is bad but this is worse then my worst nightmares...

 Currently our DataCentre backups are going to QNAP NAS repository.We are using Veeam for backup.
 Need to move from NAS to puporse Build Backup Appliance,Have evaluated and was satisfied by Exagrid. But hit a roadblock with their pricing.Wont get approval at that Pricing. We are a small-medium Enterprise.
 Any PBBA, with faster restore time,immutability option and pricing much less than Exagrid.

                              <span>I work in the MSP space. We have an IT staff of 7 with no support tiers, we all do level 1-2, project management, everything.
 I have focus on Microsoft Cloud Solutions; M365, Azure, Power Automate. My project load is enough to keep me 100% busy until about June, my calendar is up to date 99% of the time, I update my Teams status with exactly what I&#x27;m working on (I built a PA Flow to do this based on my calendar events).
 Occasionally, I&#x27;ll set Teams to Do Not Disturb with the status stating why.
 People ignore this, not everyone, but they just straight ignore it like it isn&#x27;t in their face. It&#x27;s been brought up in meetings to respect other&#x27;s time and status, but like most meetings at most places, it just ends up being talk and there is nothing formalized.
 ​
 How can I ask my team to please leave me alone? I don&#x27;t want to come off as I&#x27;m more important or rude... but I really need to get my work done.

 I also couldn&#x27;t help but notice how lightweight it is. I know its is not fancy in terms of graphics but it really puts windows to shame in terms of resource usage.

                              <span>Hey All 
 I&#x27;m a System Engineer for a tech company - have a ton of experience with VMware, VDI, Storage, and Azure to a degree and automation such as Ansible and Terraform. Anyways, the company is paying for a ton of training and emersion days which, whatever the outcome at the end of this I am fully taking advantage of.
 My question are to those who have gone through similar migrations and really looking for, generally speaking, how your job transformed from on prem to cloud - and what you did to prepare for it. What are some things you wish you knew? What would you do differently? Not from a technical aspect, more from an education and toolset aspect. Are there things that would have made the transition smoother... Not going to to say &quot;easy&quot; bc I&#x27;m not naive.. lol.

 discovered that someone has setup all of the little MFP&#x27;s to connect to google to auth and relay the email so it would land in the users mailbox. I&#x27;ve mentioned that it&#x27;s probably not the greatest setup and that we should be relaying off of something that we use or actually pay for but it seems to be going over their heads.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve sorta looked around with the google TOS and can&#x27;t really find too much aside from the link below, is there something else that i&#x27;m missing or am i just crying wolf?

 EDIT - I do have the solutions and proposed that we bounce it off our internal server/M365 or an external SMTP service that we use, but it&#x27;s been deaf ears. I know there are bigger fish to fry than this however is there anything to be concerned about in terms of licensing/privacy/policy etc? I&#x27;ve already hummed and hawed about how bounching it off of a third party isn&#x27;t exactly the most secure and know that it&#x27;s google, they will pretty much own a copy of anything we scan, but deaf ears.

                              <span>Teixeira served in a junior position, but he had access to an internal Defense Department computer network for top-secret information, called the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. That access would have allowed him the ability to read and potentially to print documents classified at the same level as many of the leaked files. 
 https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/13/suspect-pentagon-documents-leak/
  
According to WaPo the leaker of secret documents was a NG technology support staffer, basically a junior sysadmin. The guy is 21 years old and probably going to spend the rest of his life in prison as a traitor. A reminder to everyone with access to secrets to not be stupid.

                              <span>Hi Fellow admins, we are looking for a remote access tool that our remote team can use to support the end users. Currently, we are using logmein and looking to replace it with some better alternative. What do you guys suggest ?
 We are looking for predominantly for below features : 1) Elevated admin access 2) Chat 3) File transfer 4) Can push scripts or powershell console 5) History/notes 6) Screenshots 7) Record the session 8) Executable should be portable, no need to install 9) Unique code for each session(admin will generate the unique code and share it with the user) 10) Ability to take remote control or android and access the camera 11) Session transfer 12) Customise url / branding
 Any suggestions?

 Whose cameras do you like? In a previous life, I used Meraki but the company has gotten harder to work with.
 I appreciate the ideas.

 I also wanna give a shout out to my reddit friend fezbrah. He helped me and I swear people on reddit have been there for me in really dark times and good. And I just wanna shower my thanks to everyone in the IT sector.

                              <span>(I originally posted this in /ITCareerQuestions, but I wanted to post here too with some adjustments/updates)
 A little bit of background: I graduated in 2019 with a BS in computer science, no certifications yet, and landed my first job in IT a couple of months later in k12 education at a middle school. I was the sole IT person there, so I was in charge of everything that plugged into the wall, from desktop support, to sysadmin duties in the mdf room, to inventory/asset management. Being my first IT job, I learned so much there but after about 2 years it quickly got old and felt plateaued. Also the school district&#x27;s IT department started making things more and more centralized so I started losing permissions and access. 
 Anyway, I started interviewing for mainly sysadmin jobs in late 2022…</span>

                              <span>Hi All, Just wondering what your experience is with a vendor providing you with support on a product and then asking for money after spending the time to fix an issue. Usually I&#x27;ve been made aware of a support call costing beforehand. They have sent me a bill for almost 300 USD for what amounted to 20 minutes at most of basically clearing cache on the product and rebooting the server. Thanks!

 What really makes me feel f r u s t r a t e d &gt;.&gt; is when someone says their ticket is urgent, I email and call them back immediately, and they happen to be away from their desk :\
 I&#x27;m sure the answer is &#x27;Yes&#x27;, but has anyone else had this experience?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with replacing our security camera NVR. We&#x27;ve currently got a 16 channel Hikvision unit that (while being a major step up from our old java-based D-Link DVRs) is a pain in the butt with it&#x27;s requirements for proprietary video plugins and management software that demands local admin rights.
 Fortunately, we have contractual obligations with some of our customers that prevent us purchasing any additional Hikvision equipment (NDAA concerns), so our need to upgrade to a 32 channel unit gives me the perfect excuse to ditch Hikvision and our current NVR.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for an NVR that works with modern web standards, can be fully managed without specialized software (or at the very least uses software that&#x27;s not stuck with Windows 98 security practices) and has basic motion-triggered recording features?
 Also, we have a number of cameras we don&#x27;t want to replace just yet, so ONVIF compatibility is a must-have (though I imagine that&#x27;s fairly standard at this point).
 EDIT: I have to admit, I&#x27;m a bit surprised by all the software-based recommendations. On the one-hand, it makes sense that a pure software solution would offer the best features and widest camera compatibility. On the other, I&#x27;m really disappointed at the idea that there&#x27;s so few decent turn-key appliances out there.

                              <span>At my company, a scheduled group meeting of new hires meets on the first day with IT. We go over a PowerPoint presentation explaining login creds, email, apps such as Outlook, teams, VPN, and how to contact support. A real-time killer on Monday mornings. Thinking of exercising a more zero-touch approach, pdfs, and videos. Wondering how everyone else does it?

                              <span>EDIT: Meraki has specified that this a false positive.
 I&#x27;ve started receiving email alerts regarding Meraki MX blocking malicious software from 4.tlu.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com (maybe microsoft store). I think these are false positives, is anyone else getting this?
 ​
 **EDIT: I see &quot;OneNote for Windows 10&quot; was updated from Microsoft Store on one of the endpoints.
 **EDIT2: 4 years ago it was a false positive (3) False Positive From Meraki - Happy Friday! : sysadmin (reddit.com)
 **EDIT3: (POTENTIAL FALSE POSITIVE- They should have named their post better) Security Center False Positive Alert - April 13th 2023 - The Meraki Community
 **EDIT4: Per virus total
  
7f4cbddda24faf170473706c062c8957d6bb422b285013c932c61e8dd4efb381 might be Microsoft.MixedReality.Portal 
 975c0d48c41d2ad76a242d5f7270f4bf8063bb9c753b375ab2c47c9e2060f562 might be Microsoft.XboxSpeechToTextOverlay
  
**EDIT5: Meraki Support susects this is a false positive according to FishyJoeJr below https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12krgh5/comment/jg3opht/
 **EDIT6: 8:57am Pacific: Per Security Center False Positive Alert - April 13th 2023 - The Meraki Community: Due to an internal configuration issue, Windows update traffic for Microsoft Edge is being incorrectly classified as malware by Meraki Advanced Malware Protection, and is being blocked. Meraki is aware of this issue, and is working to get this issue resolved. 
 **EDIT7: 9:27am Pacific: Per Security Center False Positive Alert - April 13th 2023 - The Meraki Community: The Windows update traffic is no longer being classified as a false positive on new lookups. It may take 1-2 hours for existing lookups to age out, after which time the lookup will be marked as clean. Alternatively, the MX can be rebooted to expedite resolution.

                              <span>I have two t410, an all-in-one and a brick. They appear to be just barely capable enough to be obnoxious. I am working with a device that has a built-in webserver and I want to setup a terminal in my lab for anyone that wants to work with it; so, we don&#x27;t have to tie up a computer for just a web browser. I can ping my server, but I cannot get this stupid zero client to actually access the device with firefox. the browser keeps defaulting to HTTPS and the device I am trying to access does not have an SSL certificate. I can access the about:config and I can modify ssl and secuirty settings, but they do not retain that state through a power cycle.
 I also cannot for the life of me, figure out how to install any of the add-ons I downloaded through Hp ThinUpdate; i have them on a USB and the USB is plugged into the zero client, but I can&#x27;t get any further than that. 
 any thoughts? besides throw it away?

                              <span>Have multiple clients set up with Cerberus Professional for inbound SFTP file drops(multiple users/directories on each) on their Windows Server VMs, but as of a year or two ago Cerberus jacked the support/renewal price from $499 to $999 and as of 3 days ago all new pro license purchases are now locked in to that $999/year rate and if it expires the product stops working. Needless to say, we&#x27;re not making out clients pay that and taking our business elsewhere.
 We liked Cerberus because it&#x27;s super easy to set up and use, nice UI, and just plain works. Wanting something similar that doesn&#x27;t cost a grand a year just so we can have SFTP. Not interested in any script, CLI, Linux, or open source solutions for various reasons. I&#x27;ve seen some mentions of CrushFTP around here, still a good option and comparable to Cerberus?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an intern since a bit over a month. There are many nice people in my team but also people that are extremely difficult to understand.
 There&#x27;s a senior sys admin who sometimes give me things to do but NEVER explain properly why I should do this, what is the grand scheme of things etc
 When I ask him questions, his answers are extremely unclear and badly expressed while he is not even talking about very technical stuff...
 I was wondering if it&#x27;s a common issue in IT and if you have tips to overcome situations like this. Thank you.
 Sorry if my english is bad, it&#x27;s not my first language.

                              <span>I am trying to restrict a trunk port to just a few vlans on a Cisco 9500. Seems simple enough:
 ​
 interface TwentyFiveGigE1/0/3
 description Layer 2 to PV
 switchport mode trunk
 ​
 GHS9500(config)#int twentyFiveGigE 1/0/3
 GHS9500(config-if)#switchport trunk allowed vlan add 5,36,48
 GHS9500# show int twentyFiveGigE 1/0/3 trunk
 Port Mode Encapsulation Status Native vlan
 Twe1/0/3 on 802.1q other 1
 Port Vlans allowed on trunk
 Twe1/0/3 none
 Port Vlans allowed and active in management domain
 Twe1/0/3 none
 Port Vlans in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned
 Twe1/0/3 none
 ​
 I don&#x27;t have anything plugged into the port yet, but that shouldn&#x27;t matter (should it?)
 What am I missing here?

                              <span>So we have a medical system that looks at a text file and allows that device to print to the correct printer. Current example:
 Engineer edits local pc file with printer name (one off) &gt; user prints within app and app picks up print from local file and matches it in the back end &gt; object prints
 Now we have VDI is coming along which means the computer name etc will be changing all the time for users. Only thing I can think is having some prompt before the user is aloud to open the app that updates the file?

 It doesn&#x27;t happen if we change the default browser to edge.

                              <span>I started with my company a few weeks ago, and apparently a week before I started management emailed to users that we would be removing .NET Core 2.1, 3.1, and 5 from everyone&#x27;s machines on April 17. I just learned this last week when they put the task on me to figure out how to do it after Qualys reported these EOL .NET versions as vulnerabilities.
 I&#x27;ve looked into Microsoft&#x27;s Uninstall Tool, but I&#x27;m seeing that versions that Visual Studio installed (such as .NET 3.1 SDK with Visual Studio Professional 2019) can ONLY be uninstalled through the Visual Installer to modify .NET. I&#x27;ve also tried looking into the WMIC command line and manually uninstalling in Programs &amp; Apps, which both do not work for this.
 Am I at a loss or is there any actual way to remotely do what they are asking, such as with SCCM?

                              <span>I&#x27;m studying computer science in the 4th semester and the next one is an internship / practical semester. I found some advice for writing an Application for a sysadmin, but nothing for students. I know the basic stuff like including my skills, strengths, etc. but what should I definitely not forget in the application? (of course it depends on the job posting etc. I just thought, there could be some differences between a normal application and a student application) 
 (the practical semester is as long as the whole semester, so ~ 20–22 weeks)

                              <span>Any Google Workspace admins in the crowd? 
 We shut off POP + IMAP access to email not too long ago, to stop that &quot;backdoor&quot; into downloading an entire corporate mailbox onto non-corporate devices. And things have been quiet; people have had to access their mailbox via gmail.com or a Gmail app since.
 Now we have a few (mouthy) users who want their desktop client back (Apple Mail for example). Security is reopening the review into how to make it work. But, I&#x27;ve been through this already and want to limit the rabbit hole we go down (for the 2nd time). 
 From what I can see, I can enable/disable IMAP on a group or OU basis in Google Admin. Further, I can limit the IMAP access to specific mail clients. But that is all. I can&#x27;t, in any way, limit the IMAP to corporate-owned devices, or approved devices, anything like that. And Context Aware Access does not engage for IMAP in any way that I can see. I assume it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not opening the specific Workspace apps themselves, you&#x27;re just authenticating to establish the OAuth token.
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>So, i&#x27;ve been tasked with finding CMDB solutions that can be hosted on-prem. Apparently ServiceNow isn&#x27;t an option due to cost and an excel sheet isn&#x27;t an option due to lack of functionality.
 In this day and age it feels like just about every CMDB solution is cloud based (for pretty good reasons imo) so finding one that is actually on prem is like finding a needle in a haystack.
 What CMDB solutions have you guys come across in your line of work that have been on-prem hosted?

 KB5025221 is causing Default Apps to open when Chrome is launched. Attempts to reset default apps does not fix the issue. Also, reinstalling Chrome does not resolve as well. 
 There are other work arounds detailed below.

 I know we have users that have access to service acccounts that run power automate flows 
 -Will changing the service accounts password every X amount of months break any connections / flows?
 ​
 Basically I want to implement a password ci / cd tool for managing service accounts in our 365 tenant.
 Looking for suggestions and any hurdles you encountered with x solution (I&#x27;m thinking github CI)
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to open an account on Wasabi, but I have a question about the egress policy in the Pay-Go plan. 
 F&amp;Q (https://wasabi.com/paygo-pricing-faq/#free-egress-policy) says, 
  
For example, if you store 100 TB with Wasabi and download (egress) 100 TB or less within a monthly billing cycle, then your storage use case is a good fit for our policy. If your monthly downloads exceed 100 TB, then your use case is not a good fit. 
  
Suppose storing 50GB on the Pay-Go plan. I understand I&#x27;ll be charged for 1TB (a minimum monthly charge associated with 1 TB of active storage). How about the egress regulation? Will I have up to 1TB egress capacity? Or, just 50GB? 
 The same question goes for another situation: storing 1.2TB and being charged for 2TB. Will be the egress capacity 2TB or 1.2TB?

 Or am I just exceptionally unlucky in this field?

                              <span>Just as title says, is there a way, except manually and changing all passwords, to migrate AD1 to a new AD1 using essentials?
 If we were doing standard just throw a new AD online, sync, then down original and replace.
 Essentials doesn&#x27;t allow multiple ADs. Customer only has 15 users, doesn&#x27;t use advanced services of standard, no need, never gonna have more than 20 users.
 One thought I had was run windows backup of system only stuff, place on USB drive during install. In theory it should pull system config and backup, users, etc?
 Will that work or any other ideas?

                              <span>Hi,
 we&#x27;re currently using AD RMS with M365 Apps for Enterprise. All is working fine but now we want to migrate to Azure RMS and thereafter to Azure Information Protection. Prior to mgirate any users, I tested with my own account and set a deny permission on the license.asmx file for my user for read and execute.
 After restarting Word, I did not see my AD RMS templates anymore, which is great because this is what I expected. But instead, it connected to Azure RMS and showed the &quot;Restricted Access&quot; and &quot;Unrestricted Access&quot; template, as well as previously configured Sensitivity Labels. I did not create a SRV record for redirection, therefore I&#x27;m also wondering why it did connect to Azure RMS.
 I reverted the permission change on the license.asmx file and included my user again to read the file. I can verify this by opening the URL in the browser. I also deleted the MSIP folder in %localdappdata% and removed everything from the registry, that points to . Office is still connecting everytime to Azure RMS instead of my internal AD RMS server. I have an existing SCP, but this seems to be ignored now and I cannot get it back working to use AD RMS.
 Any advise?

                              <span>I&#x27;m comparing these two models to determine what to add to our campus. We currently have the CD50 in place. I reached out to Verkada to see what they could tell me about the two models, and the most I got out of the rep was that CD41s don&#x27;t have optical zoom while the CD51s do. Is there anything else I need to be aware of before deciding which one to go with? I utilize the command center with the CD50s we have in place.

 ​
 actually we use a sharing driver in a VM and manage the quota but i would like to have logs of users that move/delete/copy files and manage the permissions
 nothing can exit the LAN (otherwise I would have opted for OneDrive) 
 all advice are welcome!

 To begin with it should only include jdk 8 from eclipse adoptium temurin.
 https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/e/EclipseAdoptium/Temurin/8/JDK/8.0.302.8/EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.8.JDK.installer.yaml 
 Can I create this without hosting the entire backend and utilize our existing package repository, e.g. artifactory?

                              <span>I am a IT Systems Engineer for a crew transfer vessel (CTV) company for offshore windfarms based in the UK and EU. We currently have around 50 vessels that are essentially floating mini offices and each having their own network on board. We are using Peplink routers as it can use cellular network to provide internet whilst out at sea (hopefully moving to Starlink for future endeavours, but thats another story lets just say awaiting on management). 
 I just wanted to know if there is anything out there that can monitor the network for each vessel remotely in one place. I would like it mainly to monitor bandwidth usage and traffic, similar to DPI. Unfortunately, only the higher end models of Peplinks have a DPI feature which we do not use.
 Any recommendations would greatly appreciated!
 Apologies if my formatting for this isn&#x27;t great, I am new to reddit and don&#x27;t really post much.

                              <span>I inherited a domain which has been around since 2001. In Active Directory there is Trusted Domain object that has the same name as the domain also created in 2001, which makes me think it is the leftover remnant of some migration. I plan on restoring the environment and testing the deletion of this object to see if there are any repercussions but was first wondering if anyone had any ideas about what it is and if it&#x27;s safe to delete.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve enabled fingerprint login for our devices via GPO yesterday and also set it up for myself. Now the login always defaults to the fingerprint, but my laptop is closed 90% of the time and I always have to manually switch to the password login. When password is selected, the fingerprint login is working too so it&#x27;s really unneccesary to have this extra. I have now tried setting the &quot;Assign a default credential provider&quot; GPO to the password GUID {60B78E88-EAD8-445C-9CFD-0B87F74EA6CD} which also has been set in the registry as it should, but it&#x27;s still defaulting to the fingerprint. Am I missing something?

 The wiki even goes through various topics required to know for example 
 Networking 
 Security 
 Storage 
 Virtualisation 
 Operating systems - Linux / windows 
 Obviously projects and tickets will bring admins along but I’m interested to know how you all become multi skilled? 
 To answer my own question would be we are all going to be skilled in some areas but not others based on either the company we work for and what we support or maybe what we are interested in?

He visits our work area 10 to 15 times a day. He also is behind on his projects and doesn&#x27;t do much with helpdesk tickets due to other helpdesk members carrying the bulk of those tickets. Doesn&#x27;t pull his weight, and it gets frustrating.

                              <span>Hope this is the right place to post. I have a homelab I want to implement some branding on the search highlights / search menu, which can be done using Azure AD (https://techb4.com/search-highlights-logo-customize-for-windows-10-11/).
 I wonder, since it is just the &#x27;Search&#x27; app likely looking for files in a directory, or registry keys, can this be set by just putting the right files in the right place? I don&#x27;t have an Azure AD machine to test this on or find the correct locations, however. It would be nice to create a GPO with these files so all my VMs can have consistent branding.
 Not sure how time consuming it would be to just create a new fresh vm, join it to a new free azure instance to test it myself. Like take a reg/files snapshot and then join, get the branding and take another reg/files snapshot and diff them.
 Since MS removed my option for branding (the &#x27;System&#x27; control panel area) in the latest version of Windows I have to look for other areas!
 Anyone got any ideas, or is it just not possible without AAD?

                              <span>Hello
 The latest march security update (Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016) is causing an issue with my IIS.
 As soon as I install it a new DLL gets added &quot;sprequestfilteringmodule.dll&quot; and the IIS becomes unreachable (503 error). What&#x27;s interesting upon further investigation is that the WSUS Application Pool can&#x27;t be started (no error message is shown, it just immediatly stopps again). The WAS Service is up and running though. In the Event Viewer, there are errors from the WAS Service with the Event ID 5002. A restart didn&#x27;t help, the server had to be restored in order to get the IIS fast online again. More info to the server: It&#x27;s a Windows 2012 R2 Server running SharePoint 2013 and the IIS. Has anyone encountered a similiar problem with the March Update or maybe even found a solution? Thanks already for reading and have a nice day

 so i am an IT student and currently have a small Job at a real estate company which works with O365.
 I know my way around computers, programming and self hosted stuff on linux however this company is small and self hosting wouldn&#x27;t be feasible... Now i probably dont have so say it but i&#x27;ve never had a O365 curse or something like that at uni and i am the only IT guy in the company so there is no one higher i could ask for Stuff.
 The problem now is, that i am completely overwhelmed by O365 and all its features. First of all i hate it that Microsoft cluttered all the admin stuff and settings in 10000 different applications and sub-menus and there are redundant settings that get overwritten by another etc. sometimes it blows my mind how feature rich O365 is and on t…</span>

                              <span>Anyone knows any paid(or free) DNS providers, that lets you block DNS resolve from their console? What I want is, if the customer doesn&#x27;t pay me back, I want to block their DNS resolution. They might cut my login cred to the firewall, hence I am planning to use DNS resolution to disrupt their internet in case they don&#x27;t pay me. (about £5000 unpaid now)

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I am in the process of removing our certificate authority server as we no longer need it.....then I remember years ago we configured AD to use LDAP over SSL. Running the LDP.exe I can connect to any DC over 636 or 389 so it makes me wonder about the overall security anyway.
 Just wondered how many of you are using LDAP without SSL? and has anyone purchased third party certificates for SSL? That might be something I can look into.
 Thanks!

 They&#x27;re still in the startup phase so there are no solutions like SCCM yet. Already told management about this and they&#x27;ll be looking into getting someone and the usual blah blah blah.
 For now, I have to do everything manually and i&#x27;m looking to speed up the process. Not sure if you have to enable the &#x27;Receive updates from different Microsoft products&#x27; but if you scroll down a little you can find some optional updates. They&#x27;re mostly device drivers.
 I was wondering if anyone uses this and if it&#x27;s any good.
 Right now I do Windows updates and then either a Dell Command update or Lenovo Service Bridge update, but if it&#x27;s possible to merge the process it saves me a good amount of time.

                              <span>Good morning
 I have been given the green light to implement cloud based printing in our business of around 300 users and 40 printers. I&#x27;m looking to go with Printer Logic as the print queue based licensing suits our needs better. 
 I&#x27;m just curious to know from anyone that has rolled this out what your procedure was? Currently have 2 print servers, one for each site. I want to do some initial testing first with a couple of printers before rolling out across the business. 
 We have around 10 GPOs relating to mapping printers for users (the guy before created a GPO for every different department instead of just using 1 GPO with item level targetting) Is it a matter of amending these GPOs to delete rather than create/update before pushing out the Printer Logic agent to the endpoints?
 Appreciate any advice
 Thank you

                              <span>Since windows 11 has been out we have had headache issues. After updates rdp would be broken, either because udp connections would be turned off or a active x error.
 It is widely reported on the internet and there are some workarrounds (replacing the MSTSCAX.DLL file or adding a reg key for the udp problem)
 In january there was a update that should have fixed this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/january-26-2023-kb5022360-os-build-22621-1194-preview-f6973dbe-bcc4-402a-8b9a-0541b0959403
 Unfortunatly this problem keeps coming back every month or so and im getting frustrated with the ammount of time me and my team have put in these work arrounds.
 The update is installed on all our customers computers but the problem came back today after a new update. 
 ​
 Does anyone here have a better way to deal with this problem than to manualy rename the MSTSCAX.DLL files and replacing them.

                              <span>Hi Fellas :)
 I hope this is the correct flair, I was unsure if I should choose &quot;Question&quot; or &quot;Microsoft&quot;?
 I am currently having a problem with Microsoft Teams at one of our customers. It is a medium-sized company with about 30 employees.
 All employees work on a Windows Server 2019 terminal server and have a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license. Teams has the latest updates.
 At the beginning of the Corona Pandemic, the Teams-Free licenses were rolled out as a test. Everything has now been migrated to Microsoft 365 and the users have full licenses that also include the use of teams.
 Now the problem, which affects a part of the users, about a third: Teams ALWAYS logs in with the old &quot;Free&quot; account and does not recognize the assigned license. Logging out and back in manually doesn&#x27;t help either. In the free account, an old database is listed up to the end of 2020, everything after that (since using the O365 licenses) seems to be in a kind of different profile that is not loaded.
 I have already reinstalled Teams, assigned / withdrawn the Teams Exploratory license from all users as a test and deleted the Teams cache under %appdata%/Microsoft/Teams.
 If the user logs into Teams via office.com, everything works as it should and the correct content and chats are displayed, the problem ONLY affects the local client.
 Do you have any idea? Some Teams-related things are just out of my understandings... Thanks!

 I need some advice on something.
 One of our guys requests for read access to one of our databases. The database is hosted on kubernetes on hetzner. It&#x27;s a simple mysql database with customer data.
 Usually I would not expose a database on the internet. I don&#x27;t like that. It feels wrong to me.
 Am I too picky?
 What is the todays standard, to allow access to such a database?
 I have grafana running on the cluster. I could add a datasource and then the dude can build his panels and see the data. With 2fa, roles and permissions... but no Idea if I am thinking to complex.

                              <span>Hey all.
 Not really sure where else to post this. I did post this in r/networkautomation just now. 
 I&#x27;ve been going crazy the past few hours trying to fix this. I have a small EVE-NG environment running Cisco IOL and an Ubuntu box on my host machine. My goal is to start studying and writing Ansible playbooks for network automation.
 I CANNOT for the life of me SSH to my Cisco routers. At first it was giving me some Cipher key issues. Then a no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa error. I uncommented a bunch of lines and added some lines in my ~/.ssh/config file as well as my /etc/ssh/ssh_config and also an sshd file I believe (I don&#x27;t fully recall as I did a bunch of stuff).
 Anyways, i&#x27;m at the point now when I try to SSH, I get an error in libcrypto error. I have removed my crypto keys and regenerated them. I had to generate them with a higher length as I was getting an invalid key length. All in all, I cannot SSH to these routers and I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;m not the most Linux savvy but I will say I have no issues SSHing from my SecureCRT client on the same host machine. And telnet is a non-issue from my linux box either. It&#x27;s solely SSH
 Any help would be appreciated because i&#x27;d like to move on with my studies and this all hinges on being able to SSH from this linux host box. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I am looking for a router that will be connected to a 10 Gig MPLS circuit. I doubt it will be using close to 10Gig but if that&#x27;s what they are paying for I don&#x27;t want the router to be a bottleneck. Was originally looking at Cisco 4461 but even &quot;performance license&quot; aggregate throughput is only 3Gbps and &quot;boost license&quot; is 7 Gbps but only between built in 1Gbps interfaces. Would like to stay with Cisco but not a deal breaker as it&#x27;s for a non-profit so don&#x27;t want to break the bank. Also don&#x27;t need anything fancy like SD-WAN but need 4 10Gbps interfaces.
 Does anyone have any experience with Cisco C8300-2N2S-4T2X? It has 2 10Gig ports and 2 NIM and 19Gigs of IPv4 forwarding throughput if not using SD-WAN.

                              <span>So, I work as a network architect and my and my colleagues have run into something we’ve never seen before. Figured it’s time to attempt to crowdsource a solution. 
 We have a Arris E6000 running docsis 3.1 and sip with a global DQoS for the service flow. For some unknown reason whenever a call is made, immediately after the phone is hung up and the gate is closed the internet speed it throttled down to exactly 33Mbps. This last for. Early 9 minutes on the dot. It happens every single time. If the phone is left off the hook and the call is disconnected from the far end, the throttling does not occur. As soon as the receiver is hung up, the throttling occurs. 
 This happens on multiple versions of of the E6000 firmware, it happens on any modem running SIP, it happens on any speed config, it happens with a standalone sip service flow config (note the call does not use the sip service flow and instead still uses the DQoS), it happens with different modem configs. 
 It’s a head scratcher for sure.

                              <span>Hi there,
 Let&#x27;s say we got some firewall logs that shows some packet drops with source IP allocated to some disreputable ASN (A hosting provider for example)
 My question is in which point we can send mail to abuse contact and wait for reply
 If we don&#x27;t get reply from ASN, can we contact with RIR from internet governance perspective?
 I hope this is not dumb question.
 Thanks

                              <span>Ziply Fiber seems to be one of latest ISPs to begin selling a 10G service tier via their FTTH network. My understanding is that these guys are using XGS-PON for their access network, and if this is correct, how the heck are they able to claim to offer 10G? At best with no congestion from neighbors sharing the OLT port, an XGS-PON user should only be able to get about 8.5 Gbps in either direction due to FEC and other overhead. I can&#x27;t find anything anywhere talking about Ziply starting to deploy any flavor of 25G PON or active Ethernet, so what gives? Is this just another example of a company&#x27;s Marketing department having no idea what they&#x27;re talking about? I&#x27;d love to hear from any Ziply engineers if you guys are lurking here, particularly about which PON platform you&#x27;ve deployed.
 EDIT: Mystery solved. Ziply is in fact doing active Ethernet for their 10G tier (this is the transceiver they use). Kudos to them! It&#x27;s not super scalable but if they have the spare fiber strands to burn, it is the cheapest, easiest, and most performant option for getting 10G to residential customers.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m working on a GPON/XGS-PON deployment. Normally, we use PLC splitters, but a manufacturer proposed an FBT splitter so we can daisy chain our taps (ie: 10% of light going to the tap splitter, with 90% of the light going to the next tap). These particular FBTs are described to work in the full 1250-1650nm range, which is unlike anything I&#x27;ve read, but great if it works.
 I&#x27;m worried about temperature. Everything I&#x27;m reading says FBT splitters work from -5 to 75 Celcius, where PLC&#x27;s can go down to -40 Celcius operating range. The buildout is in New England, so temperatures can definitely get down to -20 celsius. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I expect insertion losses over the FBT (like an additional half db of loss) or should I expect the FBT splitter to fail completely?
 Thanks ahead of time for your help.

                              <span>To begin with, I&#x27;m not a networking expert, in any mean. I have noticed this weird behaviour of our router at work (we do web services and have many workstations connected in LAN):
  
We&#x27;ve got fiber optics connection through a modem/router installed by our ISP. We can&#x27;t ask for another model, we can&#x27;t use anything else (they refuse to setup anything else).
 Whenever the modem/router is hit by simultaneous connections (usually when more than 10 computers are connected), it crashes. If only one computer is connected and is hitting the modem with simultaneous connections (let&#x27;s say multi-threaded download), the modem crashes.
  
The actual workaround is that if we use a VPN, which means only one connection is created from each computer, there&#x27;s no crash. However, using an external VPN limits our bandwidth.
 Is there anything we can set on the network to limit the simultaneous connections? At the moment, we&#x27;re out of ideas.

                              <span>Hey Folks,
 I&#x27;m looking for some ideas on what to look for in regard to the below issue.
 The setup is 2 Nexus Switches with 4 vPC links going to 4 Isilon Appliances. (2 links per Appliance) Each interface on the Isilons have an IP address assigned and then the whole lot are in a cluster with Virtual IP.
 When all links are up I get packet loss to the Virtual IP. But if I shut down 1 redundant link per Isilon Appliance the packet loss goes away. 
 Has anyone seen this behaviour before? 
 MTU is set the same on both sides.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been asked by clients for a general overview of their IT infrastructure, while the project scope is pretty broad and they are mostly asking for a general direction of in the way of &quot;that&#x27;s OK, maybe consider tackling this, maybe you can get rid of service X&quot;. I&#x27;ve also seen in their network infrastructure diagrams that they are also (but not only) running several 2650 and 2810 switches. It&#x27;s not the focus of their request, but it got my attention.
 I&#x27;ve quickly checked their end of sale (both: 10y+) and the last time HPE/Aruba ever released software updates for the se switches (&gt; 5y for one of them). These switches have Lifetime warranty and the clients&#x27; sysadmins is aware of that. In my experience HPE was also pretty OK with replacing defective units without much fuss. Yet without knowing the exact year they got purchased these 2 indicators would tell me that these switches are likely to have high runtime and should (really) be considered for replacement.
 While I&#x27;ve worked with HPE/Aruba switches it&#x27;s not my daily business anymore (more in the system engineering field these days) thus I&#x27;m asking for an opinion.

 I am tasked with installing wifi in two buildings that are connected to the MDF via singlemode 9/125um fiber. The wifi will be broadcasting a public and private SSID on separate VLANs.
 Will any generic 9/125um SM LC SFP modules work with the indicated switch models, or are there compatibility issues among suppliers? Also do you foresee any VLAN tagging issues with this layout? I know I can do all this with fiber media converters and non-SFP switches, but I wanted to kill two birds with one stone, and cut out the converters and extra points of failure. Total length of both buildings together is approx 700ft.
 Note: there may be a MDF-IDF2 fiber run, but I won&#x27;t know for sure until I talk to the cabler. The MDF fiber panels aren&#x27;t labeled, so I didn&#x27;t include the 2nd MDF fiber panel in the diagram. But if the MDF-IDF2 fiber run does exist, the design won&#x27;t change much. Instead the 2nd SFP module will move to the MDF switch.

                              <span>Design Internet router L2 Public switch  firewall (outside zone interface). 
 How can I set up SNMP to safely hit our network on the Public router to hit Cisco Prime? Does it involve our firewall? ACL, SNMPv3, static route?? Currently, I am unable to reach my Cisco Prime server and other internal networks from that router (public).
 What do you think the best practice is? 
 The purpose is to monitor the device and BGP session (downlink, device down, etc.) using Cisco Prime. 
 I can ping the router&#x27;s public IP from the inside, but pinging from the public router to internal networks is a no-go.

 - Arris Touchstone CM8200 Modem
 - Netgear Router R6120
 - SonicWall TZ370 NGFW
 - REOLINK NVR
 - Computers
 Current set-up is Modem &gt; Router (handles DHCP &amp; is default gateway) &gt; NVR, Computers. I want to keep the router in here for Wi-Fi capability.
 Here is a picture of how I want to set this up: https://imgur.com/a/cRCLA8p &quot;Modem &gt; NGFW (X1 WAN port), NGFW (X3 port) &gt; Router (Internet Port), Router (Ethernet Ports) &gt; NVR, Computers&quot; but when I seemingly plug it in, the end devices don&#x27;t have internet.
 I&#x27;m wondering if I have to flush the IP addresses of all devices and set the default gateway to the NGFW? If so, how do I do that? If its easier, could I still let the router handle DHCP and give the NGFW an IP?
 Also the default IP for the X0 LAN port on the NGFW is 192.168.168.168. The IP range from the router is the usual 192.168.1.1-.254. In order to access the NGFW, do I have to set the X0 LAN port to something inside the router&#x27;s range?
 Thanks for any and all help.

 I am going to be building out a small POP for my business at a local DC and I have settled on a design. I won&#x27;t be changing the plan but I want some help understanding a couple of things so I can start labbing it out and not wasting an eternity on that phase.
 I have secured a MX480 with redundant re&#x27;s and line cards for this project, two QFX5100 to be core/agg level, and a handful of Cisco switches for TOR here. My intention to start is to do 2x 10G from the MX480 (one from each line card) to each QFX so each QFX will have 20Gbps capacity. I then intend to run 10G from each QFX to the TOR&#x27;s (which for right now in testing and maybe for a bit after are Cisco 4948E&#x27;s) and 2 40Gbps links between the QFX (not planning to stack them).

                              <span>Hi Guys, I know this might not be the right place for a similar request, but I don&#x27;t have any other options on my hands, might be someone from this group helping me out with my request, we have a huge traffic (more than 20Gbps as we are big ISP) towards Akamai node, we are servings the traffic from node with high latency ( more than 100 ms), this effecting on our customers quality of experience and we lost customers on daily basis because of that, we requested to host Akamai Node in our DC many times with no good answers, also we propose to invest with Akamai by paying all the node requirements ( servers, Switches, ... etc) with no luck, all our competitors have hosted Akamai node in their DC and refused the peering due to congestion or pricing issue, we tried many times but unfortunately no luck, we are ready for any instructions that might be required from them, anyone here are working on Akamai or know some guys who can help us on this request, we just need to have a meeting with them to convince them with our proposal, I really appreciate your help if you can 🌹🌹

                              <span>From srv01 (192.168.1.205) to gwith02 (host to VM vlan25, 192.168.25.75) I can connect just fine. However, since this traffic forwards through the br25 bridge, the traffic source is from 192.168.25.250. That&#x27;s fine for srv01 -&gt; gwith02. However, traffic initiated from gwith02 -&gt; srv01 won&#x27;t get there (by name). I have to do this numerically, through the br25 bridge. 
 I don&#x27;t think this is a routing issue. Is there something I can do to the bridge to change this? 
 A simple illustration:
 srv01&gt; curl gwith02 # 192.168.25.75 hello my name is gwith02 gwith02&gt; curl srv01 # 192.168.1.205 ... no response gwith02&gt; curl 192.168.25.250 # aka br25 hello my name is srv01

                              <span>Ive been using Aruba clearpass and rolling out 802.1x port authentication on aruba switches, everything is working fine on our access switches connected directly to the core switch but i have a problem with a downstream switch.
 When i try to use 802.1x on a managed aruba switch thats connected to the access layer none of the port access requests make it to the clearpass server, i know radius is working because i can login to the switch with my radius credentials and my changes are showing up in clearpass.
 The port that the downstream switch is connected to does not have port access enabled, its just a regular port with all VLANs tagged as i would configure any normal trunk between 2 switches.
 Am i missing something here? can 802.1x wired authentication work across multiple switches?

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;m new here.
 Our story begins with a switch stack, we&#x27;ll call it switch 3. Switch 3 has been communicating with another switch called switch 50.
 Switch 3 and Switch 50 are using APs to talk to each other.
 switch 3 is configured as follows:
 interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/47
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 end
 and switch 50 is configured as follows:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 ip dhcp snooping trust
 end
 interface Vlan1
 ip address 172.X.X.Z *netmask*
 !
 interface Vlan10
 ip address 10.X.X.Y *netmask*
 the meat of the story is that things in the IP subnet of VLAN 10 can communicate back and forth between the network. an example would be switch 3 pinging an IP in the VLAN 10 range (10.X.X.Y) that lives on switch 50. But when I try to ping an IP in the VLAN 1 range (Yes, I know, I inherited this network) there is no response. I will provide an example below:
 SW-003#ping 10.X.X.Y
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.X.X.Y, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .!!!!
 Success rate is 80 percent (4/5), round-trip min/avg/max &#x3D; 2/21/43 ms
 but when I ping switch 50 using the VLAN 1 range it shows below
 SW-003#ping 172.X.X.Z
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.X.X.Z, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .....
 Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)
 I know this is a whole bunch of Cisco, but I&#x27;m unsure if this is a Ruckus AP\WiFi issue or if I am missing a crucial bit of configuration on the Cisco side.
 ​
 I am re-posting this in other subreddits for visibility and insight.

                              <span>This is likely a trivial issue that I&#x27;m just not understanding... Please bear with me as I am not an expert in networking.
 I have a Synology 802.11ac router with roughly 60 devices connected. Guest network is turned on.
 About a month ago, devices in the main network started to not have internet connection unless I assigned a static IP. I don&#x27;t understand why but this has just been the case. Almost every device in the warehouse is now on a static IP. The guest network however is able to assign an IP naturally and the devices work without static IPs with no issue.
 That all being said, I have an alarm.com svr and cameras that I had to connect to the guest network to get them functioning at all which is not what I want. The svr is plugged in via ethernet (it has to be) which tries to connect it to the main network. I cannot assign an IP to the svr in the app which leaves me with a dead camera system since it cant connect to the internet.
 I&#x27;m kind of just stuck and would like to figure out how I can get the main network DHCP server to assign good IPs again and get my camera system working.
 Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me solve this!!!

                              <span>We have Cisco 3750,9200,9300 catalyst switches, we need wol feature working for some desktops (which will possibly be on the same vlan) do we need to configure anything in the access switch (3750,9200 or 9300) to get this to work (the desktops will be connected to the access switch)? 
 I know that the wol itself is a broadcast packet and the goal is if someone is VPN ing from outside then they should be able to login to the PCs even if they are turned off.
 I found this online is this something that can be done or am I looking at the wrong thing here? It&#x27;s from 2011.
 https://www.ciscozine.com/wake-on-lan-through-internet/
 They are using a router here but instead of the router can this be done on the access switch(the static arp entry)?
 Otherwise this is the traffic flow for VPN traffic from outside
 Outside (from users PC from home or wherever) - outside ASR router - Palo firewall - nexus 7k - access switch - then the desktops 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 We use Cacti to monitor most stuff on our network but I am not sure how to monitor BGP route changes. Like how do I know if the internet switched from primary to secondary isp.
 We use uptime robot to monitor network from outside because it pings the ISP IPs. But is there is a better way than to just ping the interface? When I google all I see is products that sells monitoring. If you can point me to any resources that would be great!
 ​
 Thanks! 
 EDIT: Wow yall. These are some excellent ideas.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I will stack couple of 9200&#x27;s and while reading Cisco guide, a detail made me unsure about failover.
 Cisco says system MAC will change to active switch when switchover occurs. İ can&#x27;t see any mentions about old ARP entries in other devices if stack using SVI. Is there any statement about this from Cisco?

                              <span>So I got an interesting one here. We have a server (server A) on our LAN that is just slowwww as hell to connect to. About 5 mins before the page loads. On the same subnet I have other servers that are not slow. All computers in the domain, static IP or Dynamic, regardless of vlan, have issues connecting to server A. If I check the switches and router, we&#x27;re running at about 5% utilization. Internet speeds are at gig. Someone from the company came out and said, &quot;the issue is on your dhcp network&quot;. So I&#x27;m thinking, that doesn&#x27;t make sense, it&#x27;s the same network. If he couldn&#x27;t pick up an IP I&#x27;d see that as a problem with DHCP for sure, but once he&#x27;s got one, not sure it matters. He insist when he sets his laptop to a static IP, it works fine, but when on DHCP, no luck. His static settings match what our DHCP hands out (subnet mask, dns, gateway, etc.) Any thoughts on why only this computer, not on our domain, would connect when on static and not DHCP.

                              <span>Hi, All
 I&#x27;ve been trying to setup Oxidized as a replacement for our old RANCID configuration and was wondering how this would work with Aruba switches and PFSense firewalls.
 I know oxidized works with the older HP Procurves but I can&#x27;t find any examples of it working with Aruba. I know that there is a model: procurve tag for oxidized but would that be the same for Aruba?
 Also, if anyone has gotten this to work with PFSense and would be willing to share their config and router.db file, I would appreciate it greatly.
 Thanks

                              <span>Can anyone confirm how thousandeyes pricing model works? Cisco seems to be clueless. 
 Say if we have 100 branch offices or remote sites. At each branch office, we have a core router/firewall, core switch, lots of poe switches, and access points. My understanding is we would need 1 enterprise agent at each site to monitor these network devices at the site via SNMP. Do they charge per each Enterprise Agent, or per each network device (router, switch, ap) monitored? They call these network devices Device-Layer Devices https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/device-layer/discovering-device-layer-devices
 We would then have probably one employee at each site that would have the endpoint agent installed on their laptop. We would like to run bandwidth speed test, confirm dns and basic internet connectivity is working to all cloud applications hosted on the internet. I would hope it would take into account the wifi connectivity from the laptop to the ap, the connectivity from the ap to switch, switch to router, router to ISP, and ISP to cloud application? How is this priced?
 Are we looking at 100 enterprise agents and 100 endpoint agents? 
 Can Thousandeyes replace a traditional NMS for SNMP polling and up/down ICMP pinging? Does it provide netflow, syslog ingestion, and BGP monitoring?

                              <span>We have a Cisco 4500 chasis switch w/ 7L-E supervisor and I need to be able to connect to the serial console from another room that&#x27;s a couple hundred feet away. We bought the StarTech.com Serial DB9 RS232 Extender extender (part RS232EXTC1), which has female serial connections on both adapters. We used the gender changer adapter that came with it in order to connect the blue Cisco serial console cable to the powered adapter.
 We&#x27;re not able to connect to the switch via serial, even with both adapters powered. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has done this before, and if serial extenders are compatible with Cisco switches.
 Perhaps the powered adapters aren&#x27;t necessary, perhaps the gender changer is a null modem, or perhaps the switch isn&#x27;t compatible with serial extenders. I&#x27;m hoping that someone smarter than us knows a simpler way to do this (it must remain serial and cannot be network/IP-based management). Our Internet searches are not coming up with much.

 I did not see with certainty in the switch config that it&#x27;s OS6, but I do see on https://www.netsolutionworks.com/Networking-Switches/N2000-Series/N2048P.asp
 It says that all N Series switches include Dell NOS6.. For giggles I tried other Dell OS modules but none had better result. Any thoughts?

 Weird one and wondered if anyone else has seen this.
 Ive got a guest wifi SSID which is VLAN’d out and has ACLs blocking local intervlan routing to keep it out the LAN.
 Everything else on the wifi seems to work but Whatsapp doesn’t connect. Its not really a big problem as i think im the only one using it once a week. But im sure someone will complain eventually. 
 Any ideas my current thought is maybe whatsapp has an IPV6 requirement now but not sure.

                              <span>Hi
 I just started using some opengear hardware. We have a lighthouse server behind a firewall, that cannot be reached by our opengear console switches when they are using their fallback cellular connection. My setup is using the &quot;Auto-Response&quot; that checks if the Ethernet connection can reach the lighthouse server. If that fails it turns on the cellular connection and the OpenVPN connection towards our OpenVPN server and here comes my issue. The OpenVPN connection establishes for a second before going down and then it just loops going up and down etc. I can see the following in &quot;/var/log/messages&quot;
 &quot;Apr 12 13:07:51 perifrouted[6527]: INFO perifrouted - tun0 added, ifindex&#x3D;161, table_id&#x3D;4

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m in the right sub, if not, sorry :)
 ​
 I work at a MSP which offers IaaS and SaaS services.
 Currently we are on a pure Juniper infrastructure in terms of firewall and switches. 
 However, after certain devices go EOL and the maintenance renewal is pending for others, we are asking ourselves whether Juniper is still the right choice, since the maintenance fees alone are very high.
 ​
 To give a bit of an idea of what size range we are in:
 2 hardware firewalls:
 - Mainly L4 Statefull firewall for 12 security zones with a total of about 100 VLANs as gateway.
 - 10 Site2Site VPNs
 ​
 6 switches with the following connections (not counting uplinks)
 56 x 10 GBe
 44 x 1GBe
 20x 40GBe
 6 x 100GBe
 ​
 So not a lot, but a bit of something, which is probably what we are counting with most manufacturers in the campus segment.
 ​
 We are currently considering FortiGate for the firewall and Mellanox for the switches. At the same time, I came across FortiSwitches, which I have no experience with. Does anyone have a comparable setup and recommendations regarding function and economy?

                              <span>Hello-
 I am setting up my first ERSPAN configs on my nexus 9k switches. I need 2 separate monitors each sent via a different I address. I followed along with a guide and came up with the following for the first:
 NX-01(config)# monitor session 10 type erspan-source
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# erspan-id 20
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# vrf default
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# destination ip 2.2.2.2
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# source interface ethernet e1/2 both
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# no shut
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# exit
 NX-01(config)# monitor erspan origin ip-address 1.1.1.1 global
 Then on the second I have a different destination ip and different source interface obviously, but I want that monitor to out via 1.1.2.1 and I am guessing the &quot;global&quot; command i used above makes all ERSPAN go out the 1.1.1.1 address? How would I change it so that &quot;erpsan-id 20&quot; goes out 1.1.1.1 and &quot;erspan-id 30&quot; goes out 1.1.2.1?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 Currently I work at a MSP as networking/infrastructure engineer and I&#x27;m getting to the point of burnt out. Currently my MSP supports small business and 99% of our clients run horrible EOL devices that have countless security issues and lists of other issues. Sadly my MSP is undergoing changes from a buyout and other issues, so our focus is currently on just band aid fixing 99% of these platforms and not properly upgrading or find long term solutions. This is only the start of the list of things wrong with my MSP, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion I&#x27;ll officially be moving on. I used to work for the CA government and while it was not perfect by had a lot of advantages compared to my current position.
 I wanted to get feedback from everyone on the best types of companies to work for. I understand there are great fortune 500 companies like Netflix, Linkedin etc. However I wanted to see if anyone had from personal experience a field that generally has a good IT backbone. For example I&#x27;ve been looking into banks or hospitals since both will more then likely have a huge security presence and more then likely a proper set of policies and procedures.

 It seems like my only option is to run it on a single monitor or &quot;use all monitors&quot;. Is there a way I can keep it to the 2 external monitors only? Because I&#x27;m monitoring something completely separate on my laptop.

                              <span>Got another fun one!
 So imagine you have an on prem AD, contoso.local, that doesn&#x27;t really do much outside of PC login auth but you&#x27;re quite attached to it. Then imagine you also have M365 in parallel, as contoso.com and it is in use for keeping track of M365 licenses, which is no biggie, but also for auth for some third party services, which becomes a massive PITA if it breaks. 
 Now picture a world where you want the two to work together. Now, if someone who gets paid a lot more than me hadn&#x27;t gone in and just manually created accounts for everyone in 365 and had instead used aad connect it&#x27;d be pretty simple and my life would be easier. But that was not to be. I can&#x27;t just do the needful, make a new upn suffix and have sync magically just work. 
 Can I map existing on prem AD users to 365 users with aadsync? And the PCs too, I guess, although while they[re there they&#x27;re not really there, y&#x27;know? Ultimately, we&#x27;re wanting to keep a couple AD servers on prem because it is just so dang easy to use (especially as an auth provider for a lot of internal stuff) but because everyone else is using cloud then we are too. Has anyone easily married the two without too much disruption (or work, because who wants to do more than they absolutely need to?)

 I&#x27;ve been in it for 22 years, I recognize that when I started a request like this would not have been given a second thought, however, with the way things are these days I only allow company managed computers to connect to our internal network. I&#x27;ve explained to the CFO that we have other consultants working for us who either have their own issued computers, or, are using cloud services to upload their work so that internal employees can review and save it as needed. His only argument for allowing a computer we do not manage to connect directly to our internal network is that it would be faster and more efficient for this consultant to do his work. My rebuttal is that while it is faster for him to do all of his work on a single computer it raises our risk by an incalculable amount that I do not think is worth considering.
 While I feel fairly secure in my response, and I have not relented one bit, his over the top response to this has me wondering what other professionals in the field feel about this situation.
 Thoughts? Am I the a-hole?

                              <span>IT Director asked me how to cut cost and save money!! For our IT dept for this up coming yr. Our company is 1.5yrs old in the USA but been around 50yrs overseas. We only deal with the US company. Im a System Analyst and System Admin at my current role! This past month marks my 1yr and just had my review and was told i would get a raise as my performance was great. Fast forward to this month i was informed the company is cutting cost spent to much money in start up phase! And i would need to hold off. This is 2nd time to hold off. Said raise was supposed to have came at 6mths then again at a yr. No raise.
 Boss Today asked how we can save money and cut cost for company and IT dept. 
 So i turned in my notice. And saved the company 70,000 plus the lack of a raise they no longer have to lie about. .

                              <span>Over the years, I&#x27;ve gone through various laptop docking station setups and it&#x27;s been a frustrating experience. My Dell E6410 worked reliably with a proprietary dock, but my Dell XPS 13 with a Thunderbolt dock had endless issues with detection. Even after multiple driver downloads and fresh Windows installs, problems persisted with sound and monitor detection.
 I then switched to an HP EliteBook X360 with a USB C dock, which worked well until I hit limitations with monitor resolution. I replaced that with a Startech Thunderbolt 3 dock, which generally worked fine but occasionally required unplugging and replugging after sleep mode.
 Now, with my Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 5, I use a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock for Workstations. While I can remove my laptop from the dock without issue, returning it to the dock requires a hard reboot. And when the laptop goes to sleep, waking it up is often hit or miss, with only one screen coming up or no keyboard function.
 It&#x27;s frustrating to deal with these issues, and I know I&#x27;m not alone - I constantly hear from my users with similar problems on their devices, including Microsoft Surface Laptops with both Surface Docks and universal docks. It&#x27;s been over half a decade since USB C docks became the standard and there seems to be little improvement from manufacturers. Are the engineers at the manufacturers as frustrated as we are?
 All of my experiences have been with Win10 or 11, perhaps Microsoft is to blame.
 ​
 How are you handling these issues?

I&#x27;ve pushed back on security vendors asking them to explain their AI and/or ML and they usually stutter step their way around a non-explanation. What&#x27;s been your experience?

                              <span>Ever since I was admitted, 2 years ago, coworkers complained about the state of the archive room and how it would be cool if someone, somehow, put everything online, making it easy for all of us to access stuff in it.
 There&#x27;s no way one can just put the archive online while continuing to create files on paper. So I told the President we needed software that provided all the functions for the relevant departments, and managed to find an open-source and well supported software for that.
 I presented it to the relevant sectors of the company and they basically didn&#x27;t like it, saying it would be &quot;too difficult&quot; to adjust to using it. I tried again, and they said the application sucks without even so much as touching it. Talked to the President and he insisted we must use it. Scheduled training this morning, no one showed up.
 I&#x27;m not sure what these people want to be honest. No way I&#x27;m going to be responsible for operating the software too, it&#x27;s not even my function, I just provided them the software. They dead-on said they didn&#x27;t like it and want to go back to the way it was before, i.e. doing everything on paper. I even mentioned a search in the archive can be done in less than a minute now thanks to the software and they couldn&#x27;t be pissed.
 How do you guys manage to convince coworkers? Or should I just say fuck it and let them have it their way?

 Windows 10
 In December 2021 configuring VPN through configuration profiles would break the Intune Management Extension on Windows 10. The result is very hard to notice, but it causes some of the following
  
Delayed deployment of certain configuration settings
 Certain profiles reporting &quot;successfull&quot; but not configuring all of the settings correctly
 Certain profiles not reaching the device at all
  
If you configured the VPN directly through OMA-URI and uploaded the XML file, it would work as intended, but there are still certain issues
 Windows 11
 VPN deployments have always been broken in some way for Windows 11, however in an update in May / June of 2022, Microsoft severly broke the deployment of Always on VPN for Windo…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with a project of converting our Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 servers over to requiring SSH key authentication, rather than just username and password. I&#x27;m able to generate a keypair and disable the password authentication, but what&#x27;s the best way to migrate these keys to new servers? The info I&#x27;ve read is misleading and changes with each article. 
 Mainly, I want to create a keypair for a single developer. Any server he/she needs access to, I can add their account and public key file to the server. No creds to share or store. Easy to do for one server, but what if I am setting up multiple servers for this developer? I&#x27;m dreading the thought of having keypairs per account per server.

 I understand you and your managers can be very busy and don&#x27;t want to take an hour out of your day to hear a sales pitch about a product that you don&#x27;t need, I don&#x27;t want to be that guy, trust me.
 Would providing updates on industry specific trends or updates on Microsoft&#x27;s licensing changes be a valuable way to spend time on a conference call? If not, what kinds of things would be helpful to hear about on a QBR with your current partner?
 I want to meet with you to be a valued partner, hear about any pain points or projects you have going on and potentially then position solutions for you.

 The issue is he&#x27;s the only user at this office having this happen. So if there was a policy from the server causing this I would imagine it would effect everyone. The policy does exist on their GPO but it never caused this issue to occur. 
 All the groups he is in match what everyone else in his department has. I tried checking startup on his machine and disabled anything to do with BlueBeam but it still uninstalled after a reboot.

                              <span>I am hoping you wizards can help me out here.
 We use Edge as the default browser across our org of &lt;1000 machines and have a number of Policies set in Group Policy to standardize the experience. Nothing too crazy, just some default favorites, setting the new tab page, and a few others.
 The issue is that we&#x27;ve found a large and seemingly random amount of computers aren&#x27;t applying ALL the policies. Most will apply. If you check the registry, every policy key is there. But Edge doesn&#x27;t show them under Edge://Policy
 It doesn&#x27;t matter the version of Edge, updating makes no difference. OS version makes no difference. The ADMX templates are updated as of yesterday. The machines affected are seemingly random.
 The policies were set in our Default Domain Policy (I didn&#x27;t love using that), so I copied every setting and placed in a new GPO and applied to just the computers OU. Confirmed with GPOresult -r they are receiving it (and the registry keys are there under HKLM/Software/Policies/Microsoft/Edge) No change. 
 What is so weird is MOST of the policies show up in Edge, with only a few totally missing. But even some that are listed in Edge, are not actually working. Like the Home Page URL. How could that just not work?
 Has anyone encountered this before? It is making me feel crazy.

                              <span>We want to deploy an issuing CA to a hosted VM such as an AWS EC2, but the over $1000 per month cost of the Amazon CloudHSM or $30K purchase cost plus costs to maintain a physical network HSM is too much for a single use case on a single server.
 Are there alternative methods to protect the private keys on an always running Windows Enterprise CA such as just locking down access to it in a certain way that allows it to function issuing certificates for autoenrollment to users and devices, but still keeping the private key protected from compromise.
 If it was a physical server, we might use a YubiHSM 2 plugged into a USB slot, but I don’t know that’s practical to use on an EC2 via their connector. People were discouraging it in this 2019 thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/yubikey/comments/brcnqw/is_it_possible_to_use_yubihsm_2_with_an_aws_ec2/

                              <span>We are working on alternate methods to verify users when changing passwords, etc. One of the methods we use is a Teams video call when possible, as we know the faces and voices of users. With AI technology this is quickly becoming a potential issue, but also generally speaking if a person is locked out of their account we can&#x27;t do a video call. 
 That being said we use Microsoft Authenticator for our users as a general MFA tool. I was hoping there was a way to send a push notification through Azure, but I can&#x27;t find anything.

                              <span>So long story short, we&#x27;ve maxed out our 10/10 DNS calls, and we&#x27;re basically at the 255 character limit of each DNS TXT record for SPF. All our current departments that use an external mailer had been set up just against our TLD, not any subdomain.
 The vendor hasn&#x27;t (or doesn&#x27;t support) DKIM using CNAME as far as I&#x27;m aware so that isn&#x27;t an option at this time.
 Not really looking for criticism as I am well aware the way it was set up is not the best before I got here and started to clean things up where I could and implement DMARC. There&#x27;s multiple departments (University) that use their own mailers instead of one central mailer for everyone...
 Our DNS looks as such:
  
DNS TXT SPF domain.tld: +mx include:spf.google.com** include:spf.massmailer1.com include:spf.massmailer2.com ip4:x.x.x…</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 I work at a place where all our internal tools are installed in an old (but not so bad) way. The typical infra for an app is two servers with redundancy (keepalived, HeartBeat...).
 This means one tool &#x3D; at least 2 servers + some networking and one small team for maintenance (often 1-3 people). 
 For the context, we don&#x27;t do cloud providers (sensitive data) and we don&#x27;t have to handle a lot of traffic load (internal tools only).
 When I arrived I suggested to &quot;centralize&quot; this as more and more apps were also shipped containerized. So with my team we set up a Kubernetes infra which work very well, and with few servers we are able to host like 10 internal tools.
 My points are : this brings same maintenance for all the apps (common k8s dashboard, procedures...), same backups and disaster recovery system, better security management etc. (I won&#x27;t teach you all of this I think ^^) 
 But the thing is : before all of this, there was very few service interruptions, and when it happened it had impact on one tools only. The k8s infra is simpler and more powerful, we had no interruption in one year. Last week, we had a stupid issue with a certificate in the CNI that interrupted all the cluster for one day (the k8s expert were not on site this day). 
 This event created a bit of a debate about migrating legacy apps to k8s, am I still on the right path ? How to reassure the old sysadmins ? I&#x27;m still thinking that k8s simplifies a lot our work

                              <span>We have our wired-autoconfig workstations authenticating with an EAP-TLS AD certificate. Switches send dot1x to Clearpass RADIUS which in turn returns a secure vlan tag for the switch. No certificate means the device either get some other know device category or rejected into a guest vlan. Easy.
 Same goes for wireless: workstation sends it&#x27;s certificate towards SSID secure-ad-xyz, which authenticates towards Clearpass as RADIUS. Clearpass only sets access allowed/denied.
 So a seperate SSID per purpose. My question: can Aerohive APs/SSID&#x27;s broadcast dynamic vlans on 1 SSID...? Depending the presented certificate a certain vlan tag? 
 Defining a RADIUS server is easy enough and obvious to find. But I cannot seem to find any documentation on AAA or dot1x portcontrol or how to setup dynamic//Clearpass-returned tunnel-private-group-id ..?

 ​
 They now want the ability to send email as one of their service accounts. What would be the best practice for this? 
 Would it be to add a delegate msgraph &quot;mail.send&quot; so if the service account is using the app registration with the client secret, it can send mail on its own behalf?
 ​
 Or do I have to do it by some other means, like adding the mail.send as application policy and restrict the app registration to that one service account via mail enabled security group

                              <span>Hello fellow admins, 
 Currently got an issue and which I’m unable to find a solution to myself. Was hoping some one here could point me in the right direction.. 
 We got a customer with a tenant that is being shared between 15 different companies. One of these companies want to add an enterprise application. The application requires the roles “Reports Reader” and “Cloud application administrator”. Currently trying to investigate if it is possible to restrict the scope of permissions for these roles for the application. The other companies are worried about the “Reports Reader” role since this role can access sensitive data from the other companies as well. 
 Is there anyway to install this enterprise application in the tenant without giving the app permission to read the other companies “sign-in data” and other sensitive information?

                              <span>I would like to do a phishing test with some customers, but I only find subscription models with training (e.g. Infosec, KnowBe4). All I want is an interface where I can send phishing mails to mail lists, in several languages, and see how many users clicked the link/who entered credentials in the fake credential screen/etc. Preferrably an MSP solution.
   
 From this sub, I also know KnowBe4 isn&#x27;t the most sympathetic company btw.

                              <span>Is there/wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if there was a way we could pool together our knowledge of how much we&#x27;ve paid for different systems, so we can 
 1) get indicative pricing without waking the salespeople beasts 2) see if we&#x27;re being ripped off
 Example: I really want to buy SNOW software asset management for my current work, but I cannot remember how much I&#x27;ve paid previously which is so annoying
 At the very least: tip for sysadmins, keep a private note of how much you paid for what products!

                              <span>At my current org we are floating the idea of using the new &quot;Microsoft Store App (New)&quot; and with Store for business coming to a close soon (although extended) we need to look into limiting access.
 We need to unblock the microsoft store for these apps to install successfully, but we don&#x27;t want our users installing any app they like via the store themselves, how can we limit this?
 We could potentially hide the shortcut, but that would be updated with every update so would be a never ending fight,
 I&#x27;ve read this: Manage access to private store (Windows 10) | Microsoft Learn but it looks like this applies the windows store for business, can anyone confirm?
 Would love to hear how people are managing this if at all,

 Just a bit of background - we used to be fully on prem AD company, but now we&#x27;re rolling out Intune. We&#x27;ve already had setup AD Connect so all AD accounts are synced with AAD. In this moment each member of my IT team have a:
  
Domain admin account which we use only on our servers and don&#x27;t touch endpoints with them.
 
Global Azure account for Azure/365 admin stuff.
 
Standard user account we use for day to day, without any domain/azure admin access, just with local admin on our own machines.
 
 Now that we&#x27;re rolling out Intune, I&#x27;ve setup an Azure LAPS solution (lean LAPS) on each Intune Windows device endpoint, to have a local admin as a fall back, but that&#x27;s not real…</span>

                              <span>So since MS rolled out the update yesterday for the cloud synced signatures.
 But this feauture is keeping me really busy these days.
 People lost their signatures. wel they are not lost but they are under the catagory &quot;signatures on this computer&quot; and can&#x27;t be applied automatically to the newly writen or reply mails. 
 So that sucks, cause a lot of people have more than 1 account signed in their outlook using the same signature.
 When i uncheck the box for cloud save, it still synced signatures from other personel that are using the same mail adresses. 
 Is it just me or is this feauture not thought through properly? 
 Why not make the local signatues also available for being assigned automatically? 
 Does anyone has a faster solution other then copying the signatures again to every mail adres the customer uses?
 Like how to disable this entirely before a sync even happens?

                              <span>I work in a 10-employee company with a very niche Windows-Only software.
 Some of our customers want to test our software before installing it in their productive environment, since it&#x27;s rather complicated to install and needs a server.
 We&#x27;d like to provide virtual machines to our customers with our software on there for them to test.
 Does anyone have experience setting up something like this?
 My current plan is to get a somewhat decent PC to act as a Server for virtualization since server hardware is super pricey.
 Then I&#x27;d either get a Windows Server License and create Virtual Machines for each customer using HyperV
 OR
 I would install Proxmox and buy multiple Win10 Pro licenses to create a virtual machine for every customer. 
 Are there better ways for that? Is it even allowed to provide our customer with a fully installed Windows 10 Pro with our software on it?
 Cloud (AWS, Azure etc.) is unfortunately not an option.
 I feel like there are better ways for doing what I have planned.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Looking to get some input from the hive mind...
 MSA 1050 with SAS connection to 2 Hyper-V nodes. Inherited the current configuration with 6 1.8TB SAS disks in RAID 6. this should theoretically give me around 7.2TB of useable storage.
 Additional array of 4 x 2.4TB disks installed in RAID 5 again theoretical useable of 7.2 TB.
 All that&#x27;s working as expected the disk groups state size as 7192 GB in both instances, however, in windows after mapping the volumes they&#x27;re showing as 6.54 TB in both instances.
 The first array (RAID 6 1.8TB disks) is nearly full hence installing new array to archive some data off, however, looking at the SAN management interface there&#x27;s apparently a TB of unallocated storage. Pool B has nothing moved onto it yet so I assume that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s reporting as virtually empty.
 I&#x27;ve read through the supporting documentation and followed to the letter with creating the disk group and volume. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anyone else with this problem, which makes me think it&#x27;s just the way it is, but seems odd.
 Has anyone come across this before? I&#x27;m not overly familiar with HP SANs or SAS connections to them.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am currently working as the sole system administrator for a medium sized company and I will soon leave this company for another job.
 Currently it looks like that they won&#x27;t be able to find a suitable replacement before I leave and I assume that I won&#x27;t meet my successor to show and explain our IT landscape personally.
 There is a lot of documentation available, but it&#x27;s quite verbose and I can imagine that it is hard for someone new to find specific information without a lot of reading. I would therefore like to provide an extra set of documents to my successor that contains the most important things to help get him/her started quickly and smoothly.
 Given you would be my successor, what information would help you most to find your way around as the new system administrator? What would be the most important things to have at hand when there is nobody around to ask?

 Does it mean that I need to set dSHeuristics manually? I thought it will be created by update.

                              <span>So basically we are using LAPS but that is a bit tricky when we wish to install something directly from a network share. Copying installation file over to local pc each time is time consuming and a bit of an extra step and as you know when things get tricky you choose the easiest route thus using domain admin account. So how do you guys do it when you are in a need to do a application installation quickly on a users pc?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 our marketing department, (not very big) consisting of one graphical designer, is looking for space to store large video files and other stuff. They suspect/suggest 10TB of space, so I am planning 12TB of usable space rn. Probably Raid 5 in a 4 Bay Synology NAS. 
 This is not about the NAS config tho, but about the backup.
 Would you choose backups to 2-3 external 12TB hard drives or some cloud backup solution to our Azure plan. Upload speed at that office is about 200Mbit/s. 
 We are talking Video Files over 100GB each.

                              <span>So I just got back from a relatives place. Amongst other problems, they couldn’t scan to the PC. Well I performed a test scan and it worked flawlessly. Turns out they were attempting to memorise the sequence of buttons and they got the sequence wrong instead of reading the screen, hence it must be broken. Not to mention the business being run with no backups of data on Windows 7 loaded with malware. This isn’t the worst I’ve had but a funny one I’ve not encountered before.

                              <span>We use intune for managing our endpoints. The endpoints are everywhere, mostly not in an office or managed network. Intune is mostly satisfactory for our requirements. However, we like to run arbitrary Powershell scripts from time to time for various tasks. The problem is that the script deployment component of intune is very poor (ie horribly slow and unreliable). Is there a simple product on the market that has an agent that we cand deploy scripts to? Im not looking for a tool with a million other features we dont need. Im hoping there is something lightweight and secure that does few other things other than remote script deployment/management. Its a bit hard wading through the &#x27;bells and whistles&#x27; products. TIA.

 I set up a WSUS server and am trying to understand which update does what. Especially the difference between 2023-04 Cumulative Update for Windows 11 for x64-based Systems (KB5025224)
 and
 2023-04 Kumulatives Update für Windows 11 Version 22H2 für x64-basierte Systeme (KB5025239)
 If the second one is for 22H2, what is the first one for?
 Also, what are the &quot;Windows 11, version 22H2 x64 2023-04B&quot; ones? They are classified as &quot;upgrades&quot;
 Thanks!
 Also sorry for the German. &quot;Sicherheitsupdates&quot; &#x3D; security updates

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I have been trying to get iDRAC up and running recently, but it has been driving me crazy and would love a little help if any one could!
 ​
 A bit of background:
 I have have an old Dell PowerEdge C2100 I have had for a little over two years. I have never updated the BIOS or iDRAC firmware since I have had it, as I thought that they were probably close to latest possible version being as old as it is. I now have run into an issue with iDRAC as it has become so old no web browser (even internet explorer) wants to interact with it with the exception of my IOS devices (I assume safari is very leanient on older TLS protocols when accepting the risk of an invalid cert). After some research I found a reddit post (I can&#x27;t find it but if I do i&#x27;ll link it here) about how they bricked theirs by not first updating to 1.65.66 and now iDRAC doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I then stumble across another couple posts mentioning that there are at least 4-5 stepped firmware upgrades you must do in order but no one mentions them. I have searched through Dell&#x27;s site for a couple days now and can only find BIOS firmware and some client exes on the official Dell PowerEdge C2100 downloads page.
 ​
 I guess my questions are, where can I find resources on what major versions I must update to and where can I find the update files for iDRAC? I have heard of a bootable Update ISO that helps get the required updates from the Dell Repository, is that supported for C2100s (I can&#x27;t find any trace of it).
 ​
 I really appreciate any help, thanks guys!

                              <span>I am replacing an old Netgear ReadyNAS 422 with a Synology DS1522+. 
 There are 8 users. It&#x27;s only used as a file share. The files are office files but also lots of blue prints (PDF) which can sometimes be as large as 10MB.
 I&#x27;d like to go RAID5.
 Would there be a significant benefit on going with the Synology SSDs over the Seagate IronWolf HDDs?
 We don&#x27;t need much storage. 2TB would be ok. But the difference between buying 3 HDD or 3 SSD is around $700. 
 Files are accessed over the network, on a 1 Gbps speed.
 Thanks for any advice!

Thankfully the message and its Trojan PDF was blocked by MS Defender as Trojan_PDF_QakAdobeLureZip_A.
 I have seen a few of these, including one thread that was stolen from a major corporation that had nothing to do with us (probably a mistake in the phishing scripts).
 Is the consensus that these were mined from phishing victims who gave out their email credentials and then the bad actors put a forwarding rule to capture the emails?
 How might you go about informing the original sender whose email I believe was hacked? I feel a sort of duty to do so, but these emails were from seven months ago. Any evidence might be long gone.

                              <span>An update to my previous post.
 My account rep has responded with the same stats that were linked in that thread. 
 Here is what was sent to me:
  
Regarding the presence of Fortinet Fortigate VPN our recommendation remains the same to explore ZTNA solutions. Cisco, llumio, Palo Alto, ZScaler, and Perimeter81 are some ZTNA options we recommend. 
 Using incident data and internal &quot;insert insurance company name&quot; claims data, we identify the propensity of cyber incidents based on company size (revenue), industry, and VPN Solution in place. An interesting stat that came out of our analysis was organizations using this VPN solution (Fortinet Fortigate) are 3x more likely to have a security incident. In other words, &quot;insert insurance company name&quot; predictive risk model has observed more instances of ransomware attacks at organizations utilizing this VPN solution. 
  
We are having internal talks now to decide what to do, but moving providers is one of them. I understand that ZTNA is better, but what I perceive as our threat model doesn&#x27;t warrant me going that far.
 If anyone has thoughts or ideas of what to do, I will gladly take them into consideration.

                              <span>A major focus of my daily work at Microsoft over the last year has been designing, building, testing, and documenting the new Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (aka “LAPS”). Many of our customers are using and are very familiar with the older product known as Microsoft LAPS. I am very happy to say that we are delivering today a worthy (IMO) successor in Windows LAPS. Please see By popular demand: Windows LAPS available now! for more details.
 Teaser: many of you are eagerly awaiting the public preview announcement for the Azure Active Directory scenario – we’re not quite there - sorry - but it will be coming this quarter! 
 So how do you get the bits? Feel free to just run Windows Update of course, however the following doc topic will be updated later today with links to the specific KB update articles:
 Windows LAPS supported platforms and Azure AD LAPS preview status
 And for those that are might ask: yes the feature bits are available on Windows 10 today as well! :-)
 thanks,
 Jay Simmons

 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/by-popular-demand-windows-laps-available-now/ba-p/3788747
 The list of new/updated LAPS features is greater than I dared hope for!
 👉 Password history
 👉 DSRM password backups
 👉 Emulation mode
 👉 Automatic rotation after use
 👉 GPO management
 👉 Hybrid-joined device support
 With more #Intune/#AzureAD features in private preview.
 ​
 New LAPS features in private preview are due to hit public preview later in 2023 Q2:
 ⛅️ Microsoft Graph support
 ⛅️ Azure RBAC policies
 ⛅️ Azure management portal
 ⛅️ Intune management
 ​
 Here&#x27;s a chart comparing the new Windows LAPS PowerShell cmdlets with the legacy Microsoft LAPS PowerShell cmdlets:

 This should be of interest to many here: 
 &quot;Welcome to the new and improved Windows LAPS! That&#x27;s Local Administrator Password Solution. We&#x27;ve been listening to your feedback and requests, and the day is finally here for both cloud and on-premises environments.
 We&#x27;re very happy to announce that new LAPS capabilities are coming directly to your devices starting with today&#x27;s April 11, 2023 security update for the following Windows editions:
  
Windows 11 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows 10 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server Core 2022
 
Windows Server 2019 &quot;
 
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/by-popular-demand-windows-laps-available-now/ba-p/3788747
 There are some cool new features for on-prem though
  
Password encryption: Greatly improves security for these sensitive secrets!
 
Password history: Gives you the ability to log back into restored backup images.
 
Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password backups: Helps keep your domain controllers secure by rotating these critical recovery passwords on a regular basis!
 
Emulation mode: Useful if you want to continue using the older LAPS policy settings and tools while preparing to migrate to the new features!
 
Automatic rotation: Automatically rotate the password after the account is used.

                              <span>There is a malicious website logmein[dash]123.com which *organically* ranks in 3rd or 4th place on Google, prompts the user to download a file that when executed, runs batch files and creates scheduled tasks in Windows, that fire off PowerShell scripts. From what I can tell so far, the PowerShell script makes a legit-looking Windows message box pop up on your screen, telling you to call a toll-free number. Dial the number and you are cheerfully greeted by a foreign call center that will be more than happy to help you resolve all your issues. You know how it works from there ...
 All jokes aside about logmein - the fact that this URL has been around for about 10 years and organically pops up in Google search is disturbing.
 Who the hell would type a dash in the URL? No one. That&#x27;s not how they get you. Because the address bar in your browser is also a search box, many people tend to type in the name of a website, and then click on the website URL in the search results. (Call it lazy or dumb or genius, but I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I watch people type &#x27;youtube&#x27; and press Enter, only to then click on youtube.com in the search results). So when you type &#x27;log me in 123&#x27; into the browser bar and press enter, you&#x27;ll see this malicious site prominently displayed on the FIRST PAGE of google.

                              <span>I cant take it anymore. Between the support who you can barely understand that hangs up on you and the website that takes over 45 seconds to load a page. I&#x27;m trying something as simple as getting the gen10 service pack and I get forwarded to 5 different pages before I can download it. We were going to spend a lot of money with them over the next 3-5 years but I&#x27;m pulling the plug. Vote with your money please.
 Edit: Based off the horror stories in the comments, we are definitely ditching HPE. They&#x27;re the epitome of corporate bloat. I&#x27;m also going to take a short position in $HPE.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

 Maybe it&#x27;s just my help desk but it seems like no one understands DNS and how it works. Is this something they should know or is this more system admin area I am just curious as I feel it&#x27;s basic but so many make it so hard.
 To me it&#x27;s just a phone book if phone book not available you can&#x27;t call X
 Thanks

                              <span>Looking at starting fresh with an open source solution for monitoring our physical stack. Juniper switches, Palo Alto firewalls, Dell (iDRAC) and HP (iLo) servers. Running VMWare and Proxmox in case that matters. 
 If you had to do it all over, what would you use? 
 Requirements: Open source (free), alerting + graphing
 Current options I&#x27;m considering:
 Nagios 
 Prometheus/Grafana - Used this before, but not thrilled with the idea of having to find/spin up the exporters for all the different hardware we&#x27;re using
 Checkmk
 Zabbix

So I got the community edition and this alone has made my life so much easier you don’t even understand. Previously we were using an outdated version of BEXE by veritas and veeam blows this out of the water. Just wanted to show you guys a little appreciation since I know we don’t get it often as Sys admins again thank you.

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I have been searching all over the web, Microsoft and Reddit and I can&#x27;t seem to find the answer to this issue...
 I have a client that requested O365 email encryption. I set them up with a E3 license to do so. When they first went to send encrypted emails, Outlook said that Information Protection was not enabled on their tenant. I used Powershell to enable and now they can send out encrypted emails.
 The issue is, instead of the email arriving where they can open it in a browser with a code... they get an email that requires the Information protection viewer and a Microsoft account.
 This is obviously to much for most recipients to be able to handle (I know... trust me... I know...).
 Here is the thing, when I send an encrypted email out of our organization it arrives in the code/web format. However, when my client sends it... it&#x27;s always a .rpmsg and requires the viewer to open.
 Does anyone know what I need to change to make it use the code/web version?

 What is a good way to tell a vendor who keeps emailing you to fuck off once and for all?
 What have you used that worked? 
 What have you used that you really should not have used? 
 All answers are acceptable. 
 I REALLY REALLY want them to get the message if you catch my drift. Hopefully some answers will help sysadmins all over the world.

                              <span>I have everything set to 2 days (48 hours) so that in general, systems check in once a day to renew the lease. Not causing any issues til now.
 It&#x27;s been raised with me that we have a possibility of stale DNS records with the default scavenging time of 7 days, although this has caused no operational issue, I&#x27;ve had grumbles this is not best practice.
 So opening out the question, am I doing this correctly, or does everyone else have 2 week DHCP leases to endure DNS and scavenging always stays in line with DHCP. Or is 2 days perfectly ok?

 1) Will the pre requisites change also for the Enterprise Admin? Or will they likely stay the same? I just want to get one of them ticked off so I can crack on with MS102 when it comes out in May.
 2) In prep for MS102 should I just read through 100/101 for now or will it change up quite a lot do we reckon? Not followed exam certs before so in the dark.
 TIA

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into replacing GoToAssist for my team.
 Trying to save a bit of money on budget while at the same time getting a better experience through support.
 GoToAssist has proven a bit difficult to manage remote endpoints especially if users are involved.
 I&#x27;m looking at ConnectWise and TeamViewer.
 ​
 i just need basic stuff, the ability to run a service to allow unattended access and the ability to search by logged-on user. and the ability to elevate sessions without user input.
 ​
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Years ago, I read David Allen&#x27;s &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; and his time management method clicked with me. It was pretty tool agnostic, and served me well for a number of years. Though I learned I needed to CYA more than most people would by archiving more stuff than most people would. I used a modified version of it for years with a decent amount of success with only a minimal of stuff falling through the cracks.
 I looked at a few other systems, such as Pomodoro, and one other one I can&#x27;t recall.
 Last night, I started reading &quot;Getting Results the Agile Way&quot; written by J.D. Meier, who works at Microsoft. Many people praised it as an excellent time management strategy, and either a good replacement for GTD or a nice complement to GTD. I don&#x27;t want to get too deep in the weeds on this, but a lot of his guiding principals just DO NOT work for me. His methodology is not about Agile project management, it&#x27;s more about being agile in how you manage your work.
 At work, we&#x27;re HEAVILY focused on implementing Agile. For my day-to-day work, it&#x27;s been a COMPLETE AND UTTER failure. For all my project work, it&#x27;s also been an utter disaster, mostly because I don&#x27;t work on any custom development projects. It&#x27;s all infrastructure upgrade stuff and COTS upgrades.
 I can obviously continue to use my hybrid method. But I&#x27;m curious if anyone is following a time management system that helps organize the insanity.

I assume this is probably due to an Outlook update but while I&#x27;m going down the rabbit hole figure I&#x27;d ask if anyone else is dealing with this?
 Edit: Fixed the issue by having them log out of their Outlook Account and Back in. Easy enough.

                              <span>Unfortunately, I have to set up a wildcard SSL certificate. Even worse, it is through Network Solutions. Aside from that, I am trying to understand how a wildcard certificate works. I have added SSL certificates in the past, but the wildcard piece I don&#x27;t quite understand. 
 Once I purchase the wildcard certificate, I need a CSR. Does that CSR come from the first application I am needing my SSL certificate for? I read somewhere that I need to first add the wildcard certificate to my ADCS server first and that is where I get my CSR using IIS. This part confuses me. 
 In the future, when I need a new SSL certificate for a different application, do I log in to NS and create another wildcard certificate with a subdomain? Or do I use *.domain.com every time? I feel like if I create a new one, it will remove the previous CSR I submitted and break that application. Again, this part confuses me as well.
 I would appreciate a quick explanation of how this works. Bonus points if you have used NS before, as bad as they are.

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 As part of our build hardning process, we are looking at enabling SMB signing across our laptop and desktop estate, and then eventually server estate. We are already at 80% CIS L2 compliance but this is a big sticking point for us.
 We have legacy servers. Its the ussal stuff every org has, ancient 2003 / 2008 servers running mission critical agents, databases etc. 
 I am just wanting to make sure that there werent any major gotcha&#x27;s when it comes to enabling SMB singing, specifically when it comes to sysvol access. We have some legacy DCs running 2008r2 to allow our legacy xpe thin clients to communicate and want to make sure enabling it wont impact us.
 MS docs arent very helpful for this. Decomm of legacy kit is in the pipeline and is being worked on but we could do wiht some advise. 
 cheers

I have installed middleware for the card and thought i have all services running. When i get to the logon screen, it recognizes the smart card and has the option to enter my pin but before i can enter it, the option goes away and only leaves me with user/pass. Is there anything i am missing that would cause this?

                              <span>Hey there!
 I&#x27;m stuck on a problem that I feel shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to crack, but I can&#x27;t find a good solution for it.
 I was handed a users Windows 10 VM. For some reason the original domain user account got removed from the system a while ago and re-added and - I think for that reason - it has a different SID now. Now, there are still files in that old SID&#x27;s $Recycle.bin and I was asked to recover all of them to their original location. Those files are all still there, I can see them with WinDirStat.
 Now my first instinct was, restoring files that are still in the $Recycle.Bin shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, right? I mean, they are all still on the drive. But damn, I&#x27;m doing research for hours now on how to do it and can&#x27;t find a way. Luckily it&#x27;s a VM, so first thing I did was taking a snapshot, so nothing can go wrong when I toy around with the filesystem.
 Opening the folder in Explorer with my Domain-User Account of course is not helping since the files are tied to a different user.The next thing I tried was simply to rename the Recycle Bin subfolder, that includes the old SID as a folder name, to my SID. After I log into my user account then, Windows now tells me my Recycle Bin is corrupted and asks if I want to delete it. So, I reverted to my snapshot.
 There are tons of tools out there that can recover deleted files from NTFS, but seemingly no tools to recover still existing files from the recycler?

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 we are a small company with many stupid solutions which were created by my boss before there was IT but it is what is. 
 We recently introduced Active Directory to our company and I was hired to administrate that. Howevery my boss is also using the same server to store confidential company data on that same server. How can he limit my access to these volumes while maintaining enough rights to administrate the server? 
 He tried to remove every account inside the security permissions list beside himself but I can change the ownership of the file by going into &quot;advanved security permissions settings&quot; (button down below) and just changing the ownership to my AD Account again and adding back all my permissions. I am inside the &quot;domain-admin&quot; group btw.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I have been tasked with quite the pickle of a problem - we operate globally, and since the pandemic, a lot of our sites have switched to a hybrid working model, up to (almost, but never exclusively) home office. 
 Now, our business is in the field of high-end CAE / Engineering, so high performance / powerful Laptops are a must (Think Dell Precision 7670/7770 with i7/i9 CPUs, Quadro GPU, 64+ GB of Ram). 
 This led to a very peculiar problem though, namely home office in regions of the world that get very hot in summer, and where people are too poor / it is not usual to have AC at home - we&#x27;re talking operating temperatures of up to 45C (113F). 
 No common Laptop is rated for this (they all top out at 35C / 95F), and even the performance ones will throttle heavily at these temperat…</span>

                              <span>I know, there&#x27;s probably no factual correct answer and maybe I just need to let out some steam, but....
 &quot;Heavy users&quot; are killing me - it&#x27;s almost like 10% of &quot;my&quot; users takes up 90% of my time in tech support.
 How do YOU deal with them in a way where you don&#x27;t get drained and stressed out, so you&#x27;re not mentally and physically fit to still help the 90% rest of the users, that don&#x27;t come running every second day?
 I can&#x27;t image it would solve anything - probably it would even make things worse - if we give them the cold shoulder but I feel like I&#x27;ve run into a dead end, trying to help everyone whenever they ask for it.

                              <span>Hi, 
 we are looking for a web-based tool for a self-management of AD-groups. Has anyone an advice? 
 To give some background: We use Linux clients company wide. So any windows-based tool is impossible or needs further expenses we would like to avoid.
 The process is that IT creates the AD-group and defines an owner. The owner (can be everyone in the company) has to check/set members. So the tool should allow to resolve nested-groups to actual people/member. The process of checking the members and the overall requirement of the AD-group itself is part of the compliance processes and belongs to the group owner.
 Right now it&#x27;s resolved over tickets to the IT which blocks way too much time on the admin side. 
 Our idea is a web-tool which gives all the AD-groups belonging to the owner in a view where they can see the members and add/delete them from the group. Deleting/creating the group shall still be part of IT.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m from Germany and evaluating public clouds (esp. for compute, databases, storage, etc.) for our company (30 ppl) regarding a potential migration. Coming from on-premise with dedicated servers I&#x27;m collecting pro/cons and potential challenges with a migration and looking for experiences of others who either did or did not a migration:
 - How did your setup looked like before and after migration?
 - What did go wrong during your migration?
 - What&#x27;s most important to look at in preparation or during migration?
 - Maybe especially for German folks: How did you handle privacy issues (GDPR etc.) and why did you either chose a German or non-german cloud provider?
 - Are there any cloud trends we should look at specifically?
 - What would you love to see changed in public clouds (and is a regular blocker or problem for you)?
 - Which cloud are you using (and why) or why did you not migrated to a cloud?
 Thanks for any comment and thanks for sharing your experience!

                              <span>Hi Guys, 
 I have been tasked with setting the the registry values in the hive:
 \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\DefaultMediaCost
 However i tun into permission issues, as only the &quot;trustedinstaller&quot; have full control, all other accounts have read access.
 As i am going to edit the property on 1000+ machines, i would like to find a solution where i do not have to manually edit the property and take ownership in order to have it changed. 
 I stumbled upon this post:
 https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-set-an-ethernet-connection-as-metered-to/ecdaca08-d413-4a6a-9e33-b4afb337fc18?page&#x3D;1
 But i am not 100% safe, with the solution provided within the post. 
 Have anyone succeeded with a different solution ? 
 Kind Regard

                              <span>Hi,
 I had the same issue twice with Windows Server DHCP service in two different customers in the past few weeks.
 Customer 1: Windows Server 2016 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Customer 2: Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Issue: after installing Windows updates as scheduled, the VM reboots. After reboot, two events are generated in the Event Viewer and the VM stops giving DHCP addresses. The Lease page under DHCP panel is empty.
 Event 1: 
 ID 20090
 SOURCE &quot;DHCP-Server&quot;
 Description &quot; DHCP Server is unable to bind to UDP port number 67 as it is used by another application. This port must be made available to DHCP Server to start servicing the clients.&quot;
 Event 2: 
 ID 1041
 SOURCE &quot;DHCP-Server&quot;
 Description &quot; The DHCP service is not servicing any DHCPv4 clients because none of the active network interfaces have statically configured IPv4 addresses, or there are no active interfaces. &quot;
 Resolution:
 Restarting &quot;DHCP server&quot; service fixes the issue. It is still unknown what exactly causes this issue.
 Has anyone encountered anything similar?
 PS. Sorry for my English I&#x27;m not a native speaker

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been getting complaints from random users about their systems sometimes taking more than a minute to log in. When all is working properly, the time from pressing enter to taskbar appearing is between 17 and 25 seconds.
 I was trying to find an eventlog eventid for the beginning of login and for when the taskbar is loaded. I&#x27;ve got 7001 for beginning but haven&#x27;t seen anything which matches load of the desktop/taskbar. Any suggestions would be welcome.
 More info:
  
Hybrid AD joined Windows 10 22H2
 All recent i5 / 16GB laptops
 FSLogix profile redirection
 All devices on WiFi
  
I have tried getting Intune Endpoint Analytics working but very few of the devices are reporting and I haven&#x27;t been able to determine why. But the downside of this is that it doesn&#x27;t give a number of seconds, only a score and only reflects when CPU goes below 50% after login.
 My goal is two-fold.
  
Identify problematic endpoints and/or users.
 Prove to management that the median sign-in time is reasonable.
  
(yes, I now know that FSLogix was the wrong choice)

                              <span>I have been working as a SysAdmin for 7 years now and I feel like my job has been just exponentially expanding without proper pay compensation.
 Hardware, software, helpdesk, consulting... we do it all.
 Microsoft products,
 Atlassian products,
 Hardware/software procurement and licensing,
 Networking,
 Helpdesk,
 SAP
 Basically, you name it, we are expected to support it.
 This might be just my shitty company at this current time, but I feel like it has been the same in the last 2 I worked at.

 Wondering if anyone knows if WSUS Offline CE is still under development?
 Noticed there haven&#x27;t been any updates since January so was curious as to the project&#x27;s status.

 Found the issue, they no longer auto mount the drive 
 so boot of a 2022 iso
 repair pc 
 drop to CMD
 disk part
 list vol
 sel vol that is your c drive
 assign letter &#x3D; what ever you want that is free
 list vol
 exit 
 c:
 done

 Hey,
 Working on getting a 2022 template in place, and the admin password has been lost, no issues, thought I would reset it the old way with cmd from recovery mode and replace utilman.
 although I can get to recovery and get CMD, for the life of me I can not find what they have mapped c: to, I have been through the whole alphabet from A to Z, I get a hit on x for the recovery.
 I thought I would try from the iso and use the fix my system option, I get a hit once again on x and d this time, but only setup files, not the actual c: drive.
 VM is booting efi and secure boot is off, any thoughts? Is this method still possible or they finally removed it?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am using DMVPN solution on Cisco IOS XE devices.
 The IPSec tunnels created are protected using CA certificates.
 Now I noticed that the IPSec tunnels will stay up even if I deleted the certificate , and the tunnels will not go down except if I disabled and enabled it again (Probably because the IKE is reinitiated).
 Is there anyway to force IPSec for routine Certificate checking , so that in case the CA certificates at the client is revoked, deleted or expired for some reason , the IPSec tunnel will go down ?.
 Let me know what do you think.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey there. So, not a whole lot of experience with remote access VPNs but I’m doing my best. Got a problem here that I’m perplexed by and don’t really know where to start… at least before saying “the connection your using is garbage.”
 So last week we changed the domain we were using as a vpn endpoint… was a red tape thing after being acquired… We were told to add “vpn.domain.com” to our existing domain… Anyways the change went well… or so we thought.
 About 12 hours after the change about 90% of people could connect… Of the 10% that couldn’t we realized they ALL had Spectrum at home. No one had issues with Comcast or ATT.
 Now, we have two guys on a business trip to do some maintenance on our servers at an out of state colo. They too are also unable to connect and are receiving the same error message “Cant connect to the specified secure gateway.”
 My manager says its because we don’t have ‘DMARC’ set up for this new domain… Everything I’ve read on DMARC seems highly specific to email so I’m very confused how this would be relevant…
 Without going down a rabbit hole – does anything jump out here that I should check? Not trying to waste anyones time… just curious if this is something obvious that I’m oblivious to.

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;m going to preface this post by saying I have never had hands-on experience with an Enterprise MPLS network or the process of ordering such a service. That being the case, there is a ton of information out there about MPLS and how it works, how you configure it within devices, etc. But one thing I can&#x27;t seem to find is any information about the underlying Layer-1 transport for MPLS. I&#x27;m aware that MPLS doesn&#x27;t really care if it travels across UTP cables or Optical links but what I&#x27;m wondering is this; For those of you who have actually installed MPLS circuits what type of Layer-1 connectivity have you used? If optical, what kind of optical (DWDM? Something else?) and how was that optical fiber provided to your company? If copper, did it use RJ45 connectors? Something else? Just trying to get a feel for how MPLS is physically provided to a company. Thanks!

                              <span>Greetings
 We have a customer who is currently using Citrix for WANOP , customer is interested in SD-WAN (Viptela) but Customer requires HA in their environment to mimic what they are doing today with Citrix via a /30. They are not interested in obtaining a /29 OR running a TLOC via Viptela.
 What technical design aspect can be implemented to achieve the design requirements?
 Appreciated.

                              <span>Has anyone here ever demanded a price cap from Arista and gotten it? I know other vendors have either told us to get lost while laughing (when I worked for smaller organizations) or there has been a negotiated one (when I worked for very large organizations), but I only ever saw 1 in 50 get a price cap and Arista told us they don&#x27;t do price caps, even for larger companies. So, my ask, is have you ever gotten a price cap negotiated with Arista before?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 We would like to announce that we have decided to disallow all posts and comments that use prompts generated by ChatGPT or similar large language models.
 The core of the matter is the fact that ChatGPT is not a source is truth, it&#x27;s a word projection model. It can munge words together to create a seemingly impressive answer, but cannot definitively tell you how it arrived at its answer. While sometimes it can provide some sources for the answers - unless the dataset is constantly refreshed - the links to its sources may be broken/no longer work.
 As always, we welcome your feedback and suggestions for how we can improve our subreddit.

 Does anyone know if the Remote ID Adapters tests for wire pair mismatch like the Wiremap Adpater or is it strictly for ID&#x27;ing the ports? Can&#x27;t find it explicitly stating so, so I&#x27;m guessing not but hoping someone who as the Remote ID Adapters can verify.

                              <span>We have a couple of /24 public IPs we&#x27;d like to advertise via BGP on two redundant ISP links that are layer 2 on some outside switches. (Both /30)
 The thing is with current firewall setup (Well most anyone does this) how do you share a single subnet 
 The whole point is for redundancy and failover within the SD-WAN option. (Fortinet)
 Can&#x27;t simply null the route as we&#x27;re NAT&#x27;ing addresses and servers behind it. (First suggestion for us.)
 Asking here instead of the vendor subnet as I feel there&#x27;s a large breath of know how.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Maybe this showcases my laziness, but why are there so few network manufacturers with product selectors on their website, especially in the enterprise field?
 I&#x27;m just trying to find a reliable access point and managed switch to pair with a Firewalla Gold, and having to read through the characteristics of dozens of similar-looking products to find the small differences between them is daunting. I would just want something where I can select my intended use (home, enterprise, etc.), the number of ports, the features I need (PoE, VLAN, etc.), and it would suggest me be the best pick. At the very least, having a usable filter to reduce the sample size would be much more intuitive.

All environment share same physical interface, usually if this on prem firewall i will solve this by using multi vdom for each environment, or by using multi vrf and multi sub interfaces, but since these both options are not available for me i wonder how can i solve this issue

                              <span>Our core nexus were running version 9.3.8 with no issues with radius. After a weekend upgrade to 10.2.4 radius stopped working. Pre and post config matched. I removed radius config to gain access using local accounts.
 Any idea if radius user attributes have changed? After upgrade my Vasco account was using network operator and was using network admin before.
 I can create read and write access group profile for network operator but I have feeling user profile attributes have changed so I need to really make the change at the radius server.

                              <span>Hey all. I work for a public library, and we&#x27;ve got issues with our staff printer. It&#x27;s connected to our network, so all of us on the staff wifi connection are able to print to it. The printer is a Toshiba eStudio3015ac, if that helps.
 ​
 The problem we&#x27;re encountering is randomly, sometimes a couple times a day, sometimes weeks apart, we&#x27;ll get a random print job come through that none of us sent. It&#x27;ll be 100+ pages with random letters/numbers/symbols on the first page, tons of blank pages, then a random symbol/letter/number on a page.
 ​
 Our network security company wants us to call them when a print happens so they can check the packet (I&#x27;m thinking is what they said? I&#x27;m a tech guy but networking-wise I&#x27;m clueless) and see where it&#x27;s coming from. Our copy company is stumped as to what&#x27;s causing it--they thought it was a faulty print driver, but we&#x27;ve replaced them on all staff laptops and it&#x27;s still causing issues.
 ​
 We&#x27;ve downloaded Wireshark to try and monitor the traffic, but I&#x27;m having no luck figuring out how, exactly, to monitor incoming prints on the network printer. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hello there,
 Looking for some recommendations for setting up a wireless bridge between a building and a field press box. Line of sight is clear and shy of 100m. Unfortunately trenching is not an option.
 I have a couple of NanoStation M2 however, the needs will include video streaming and spectator wifi. Goal is is to add a small switch in the press box and an outdoor AP in the stands. Afraid the NanoStations would not be sufficient.
 Was looking ideally at something that would work in the 60ghz with 5ghz failover and could give me approx gigabit duplex.
 Found MikroTik &quot;wireless wire&quot; for about $200 which is the first time I hear of them, but is there anything similar in price and management that can be done with Unify? The &quot;building to building bridge&quot; is $500 and seems to need some sort of management console (I think it can run in a VM so plausible). Any decent known solutions under $500 total?

 Our main network is 192.168.195.0/24 and the software uses 192.168.2.0/24.
 All I&#x27;m trying to get is give access to the second network on our switches so we can access both networks.

                              <span>I had a request from our security folks to look into disabling HTTPS access on the spines and leaves in our ACI environment if we don&#x27;t use it. To the best of my knowledge, we don&#x27;t use the object store browser on the leaves themselves, we really only use the web interface on the APICs. I reached out to TAC and they recommended creating a new set of contracts and EPGs for in-band and out-of-band, applying a filter to block HTTPS to the contracts, and adding the leaves and spines to those new EPGs for in-band and out of band.
 I went ahead and built this and moved some leaves into the new EPGs, and the block works for out-of-band (e.g. I can nc -zv  443 and get no response), but not in-band, and it&#x27;s not clear why. Initially my thought was to set the filter to block 443 as a source port and add the contract as a provided contract, which seems to be what works for the OOB port. On the in-band EPG, I did the same thing, adding a filter for source port 443 &gt; any and setting my new contract as a provided contract. That did not work, so I&#x27;ve since tried adding a filter for any &gt; dest port 443, changing it to a consumed contract instead of provided, etc. I&#x27;ve opened up a TAC case, but they took a look at what I had configured and said it seemed right, so they&#x27;re waiting on feedback from a higher level engineer to see if there&#x27;s something additional needed.
 Does it sound like there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hi there
 I should first start off saying that I have no real knowledge or experience with networking. I’m an investigator trying to solve a problem here so I appreciate any simplistic answers.
 Essentially a client was extorted online through social media in which I have confirmed their IP addresses as of October 10, 2022 as:
 197.210.76.195
 197.210.76.208
 Both are Nigerian
 Through further investigation I found a suspect who logged into social media also on October 10, 2022 using the IP address of 197.210.76.99.
 What are the odds they are the same person?
 I have found similar connections in which the xxx.xxx.xxx have all matched but the last numbers were different, however they were generally a day or two apart. The above are the only IP addresses in which occurred on the same date.
 I appreciate any help on this!
 Thank you so much for the time.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I want to be able to discover unwanted/new network devices via my monitoring tool (SNMP) . I could alert myself when a physical interface goes up or something. But I don&#x27;t necessarily want to know if some random colleague plugged in a Laptop in their port. 
 I -do- want to know if somebody is plugging in a network switch or router. Regardless of the vendor. 
 Does there exists SNMP MIB&#x27;s for Cisco (Catalyst) or tooling or a trick for this?

                              <span>Hi, we’ve moved our tiny office to a new town and the new place has password protected WiFi as part of the lease using the guest wifi, which is fast enough but we’re used to having our own line for Ethernet devices and a private internal network paid for by us. 
 It being fast enough and free is a real help though, and would save us quite a lot, so we were wondering if there’s a way we can utilise it.
 Is there a way to use the guest WiFi login as the incoming line but have our own router create a new network off that with WiFi/Ethernet? We have a draytek vigor 2860ac in a box from the move along with an AirPort Express if that’s of any use, and the new building appears to be using ubiquiti circular ceiling APs of which one is in our new room. 
 I’m semi literate with all this, but there’s definitely a lot of the draytek back end that is past my current knowledge so hopefully I’ll keep up!
 Thanks very much

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m a bit confused on what I can do with radius authentication on a switch DELL N2024. Inside my network I have a lot of programmers that are using some virtual machines for executing vendor based software in their laptop. These virtual machines are otside the domain and also of my control (no antivirus, no policy, ecc). I thougth of isolate the VM traffic using the network authentication in the host PC and also in the VM. The idea is to put the host inside a VLAN that can comunicate with the secure area and the VM in a restricted VLAN. The host usually use only one NIC shared, is it possible with radius authentication assign different VLAN on the same switch port based on the authentication?
 ​
 Any other suggestion will be apreciated. In the era of cryplocker the risk of keep all the traffic together is too big.
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>Lately, I was updating all our Firewalls and was anxiously waiting for the VPN-Tunnels to come back up. Now these locations are all around a 1 hour drive away. So if one of them didn&#x27;t come up, I&#x27;d drive there by the next day to fix it. 
 We&#x27;re using Fortigate Firewalls which do IPSec Tunnels to connect our remote locations. The remote locations have an internet-connection, but we force all their traffic through the tunnel to enforce equal FW-Rules.
 But if I had a location that was farther away:
 What are my options for access without being physically present?
 What kind of device could I use for out-of-band management? Something like a proxy so I can open SSH-connections or even Webinterfaces via (preferably) a cellular connection?

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing a deep dive on IPsec right now, trying to understand what exactly is happening under the hood. Went ahead and read (portions) of RFC 4301 but I&#x27;m getting conflicting information here regarding the implementation of the SADB vs the SDB.
 In section 4.4.1.2, they walk through the structure of an SDB entry, saying that it includes the following:
  
Match criteria (selectors, names)
 Action (protect/bypass block)
 IPsec Protocol Type
 IPsec Mode
 Tunnel Source &amp; Destination
 Algorithms
 A few other things (i.e. DF bit &amp; DSCP handling)
  
This all sounds well and fine... then I got to 4.4.2.1, talking about the SADB... and some of the same fields are listed there again, including Algorithms (but this time described in greater detail?) as well as the DF bit and DSCP handling piece... I just figured that there was a bit of overlap or something... but then I went to Appendix C, which also describes an SDB entry... and it had even more fields listed which I thought were SADB-only... specifically, the SA lifetime.
 So I&#x27;m a bit confused here... would appreciate it if someone could answer the following questions.
  
Are the encryption &amp; confidentiality algoritms included in both the SADB and SDB? Or is the &quot;algorithms&quot; piece in an SDB entry referring to something else?
 Which fields are supposed to overlap between the two databases... and also, why?

                              <span>Hey all,
 So a client the other day had clicked a phishing link, entered a password and had some mallard on her system.
 Was able to remediate the initial problem.
 However the client was intent that her system be wiped.
 While onsite, went through and backed up all of the regular folders, documents, downloads, etc.
 I asked the client if this looked okay, she stated that&#x27;s fine as all of her data was mostly on the cloud. I did double check with her as I have had horror stories with this in the past and she was confident in the cloud.....
 Wiped the machine and have been working on file recovery every since as a lot of the quickbooks files were locally stored. Pulled all of them back from the dead but now they aren&#x27;t working in QB.
 Feel horrible and still working on it as we speak.. please ask any questions to fill in the blanks of my panic story as I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve missed a lot of details.
 AAAAHHHHHHH :(

                              <span>I started my first Systems Administrator job today. It really seems surreal despite ~7/8 years experience in various technology positions and ~8 years at a small MSP. This gig is different though. It’s a fairly large company with real enterprise topology and loads of technology thats new to me. I know I’ll kick ass but, I’m super nervous. I feel like I should immediately be proficient in everything even though I know that’s impossible.
 Please share your stories of your first Sys Admin gigs and let me know if you have any advice for success in my new role.

                              <span>So my boss retired during COVID lockdown and I&#x27;ve been the interim since then. Went through the whole business of transitioning people to work from home and then back , lots of hours of supervision on top of my sysadmin duties, 50-60 hours work week. Since it is a state agency, we have to apply for the job officially, nobody gets a hand waive promotion if you may. So I applied and to my biggest surprise they offered the job to an outside person who has no sysadmin skills but ran a larger department with more workers. 
 That tells me that my work is not valued and I should start applying for other jobs, right now I feel pretty disappointed and angry at upper management. I have not broken the news to my staff yet because I don&#x27;t want to be emotional about it, but man I am pissed. I do love being a sysadmin and not have to do front office kind of things. Maybe I will now work for the amount of money they pay me, which is low but with a lot of perks.
 What would you do?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll admit that I don&#x27;t completely understand how LDAPS is supposed to work with remote applications, so this might be normal.
 We have a new web application that sends LDAPS requests to our AD servers over a site-to-site VPN.
 I found out today that during the LDAPS authentication process, the remote app saves the user&#x27;s password in the app&#x27;s database. Presumably it&#x27;s then passed to the app.
 Is this normal? I thought the LDAPS process was simply to get a success/fail authentication and that success/fail is passed on.
 Obviously I don&#x27;t like my AD passwords saved in someone else&#x27;s database, even if they are encrypted.

 They don&#x27;t appear to make sense to keep purchasing.
 I noticed the Surface Hub subreddit is dead.
 Do you plan to buy Gen 3 Surface Hubs if they are released?
 What&#x27;s the alternative? A &quot;dumb&quot; giant touch screen with wireless display from a laptop?

 However, they never explain exactly how that&#x27;s done.

 Does anyone have the missing info?

                              <span>I had a new manager create a ticket and them immediately make his way to my staff to expedite it. Fortunately the team thar needed to address the ticket doesn&#x27;t sit in the office so headed over to my desk to expedite. (I am the head of the department with a couple levels between me and the support desk)
 I asked him if he had a ticket in, and he said &quot;yes but need this right away for something I am doing for the CEO.&quot;
 I informed him, &quot;if you put in a ticket our typical SLA is a day or two. It will be worked based on urgency.&quot;
 &quot;Well can you check the status?&quot;
 &quot;I assure you if you put the ticket it then if is in the queue and will be processed.&quot;
 He left dejected and huff, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why it takes a couple of days to just push some buttons.&quot;
 I always appreciate the arrogance of people who think they can name drops and bully their way into the front of the line. That isn&#x27;t our company culture and I know the CEO well enough to know the would be upset if they knew I let this guy skip in line.
 For what&#x27;s is worth, I reviewed what they were asking for and it isn&#x27;t something that will be approved anyway. Somebody showed him a beta system that isn&#x27;t production ready and now he is demanding access--he isn&#x27;t a beta tester for the system and his desire is to use it for production use.
 Icing on the cake, one of my team members picked up the ticket about an hour after it was submitted and made multiple attempts to reach the manager and couldn&#x27;t get a response back from them today. As usual it is ultra critical but not critical enough to actually respond.

                              <span>I’m an IT manager and I’m earning just under 100k UK. I see jobs for Heads of IT, IT director and IT manager at salaries between 25k and 150k.
 Now I get there is should be a vast difference in capability between the bottom and top and companies have a different requirements and risk acceptance factors.
 However I will give the example I worked at a hospice for 50k and they wanted me to hire infrastructure engineers at 23k which was just not possible for competent ones anyway. I explained the risks of hiring people that needed training and asked tounge in cheek why don’t we hire doctors without the experience to perform the role to save money? Well the answer is that’s illegal and we have to pay going rate.
 So my question in a roundabout way is IT salaries so out of Wack because there is no professional accredited body that makes doing IT work illegal without.
 Would it actually benefit IT to have such a body even just for government work. Even if it is a joke like part P or Gas safe but atleast shows some competence

                              <span>Afternoon guys. I am the lone sysadmin of a small 25 person office.
 ​
 We have a laptop refresh coming up - 25 Lenovo T14 laptops running Win10.
 We don&#x27;t deploy new laptops very often - maybe every 5 years. We do not have an imaging infrastructure in place.
 I would like to keep things as simple as possible as I have other things on my To-Do list.
 Here is my plan: Please feel free to comment or add some advice as you see fit.
 ​
  
I plan on building out one of the new Lenovos with all our software and the latest updates.
 
Then sysprep it.
 Use Clonezilla to capture the image onto an SSD or thumb drive
 Then set up a small mini lab where we can deploy 4 or 5 laptops at a time with the image
 Add newly imaged laptops to domain and tweak for individual users (mapped drives, bookmarks, etc.)
  
Question. I plan on just using a thumb drive to boot up Clonzilla on the laptops and using a local SSD drive or thumb drive to host the image file for each laptop. Would it make a speed difference if I store the image file on an SSD USB -C drive as opposed to a regular USB-A drive? 
 ​
 Thanks guys for any wisdom.

                              <span>All, I have a couple of dozen people using the same folder hierarchy and occasionally one folder gets dragged into another inadvertently. Is there any way to bring up a prompt box to ask the users if they really want to do that before moving the folder? I don&#x27;t want to lock the structure down. They are all sophisticated and careful enough that this isn&#x27;t a frequent problem and they all have good reasons to modify hierarchies from time to time.

                              <span>Our licensing is up soon for VMWare and my rep reached out to talk about their “new, better” VSphere+ subscription model (a bunch of nonsense to just make more money off of us, by the way they want to bill PER CORE now) that they are looking to implement within the next year, though right now I have the option to re license under our previous agreement “but if I sign up for 3 years with the new VSphere+ they can guarantee my subscription pricing per core and lock in that rate”. Sounds a lot to me like they’re trying to con people into their new pricing scheme before everyone jumps ship when Broadcom fully takes over and destroys their product just like they have for everything else. I was trying to remain hopeful that maybe this time it would be different but…Broadcom hasn’t even fully taken over yet and they’ve already almost doubled my licensing cost per year with this new scheme, what a scam. I got a laugh when I got the cautionary reminder at the end of the email “the price can be locked in year over year with VSphere+, but the price can’t be guaranteed when you’re up for renewal next year if you don’t go with the proposed pricing”. 
 Needless to say, I’m going to talk to my team about it all but I believe we’re are going to be in the market for something else. Anyone have any recommendations? Has anyone else made the migration to something new recently?

                              <span>Title sums it up. Have been at my current workplace for 9 years, only my 3rd company in 17 years. I Like it and good people. I&#x27;ve been feeling in a rut though.
 To summarise my position; I&#x27;m the IT &quot;supervisor&quot; but really manager. My boss is the director but still doesn managerial stuff so I&#x27;m caught in this weird limbo.
 It&#x27;s a small place so I&#x27;m also not being paid well compared to others in the field but that&#x27;s the tradeoff with SMBs, I think.
 My wife feels like it might be time for me to go to #4 and make a career move and I do agree with her.
 For what it matters, I&#x27;m also located in Canada.

                              <span>We recently had a switch in our website hosting provider and I&#x27;m hitting my head against the wall on what I&#x27;m missing here. Everything works externally, but we have a split-brain DNS setup in our internal network. It&#x27;s been set up that way for a long time and it&#x27;s not something I can completely remove unfortunately, at least not right now.
 So externally, www.domain.com resolves and is proxied through Cloudflare and life is good. (see screenshot in attached album)
 Internally, however, is where things aren&#x27;t currently working. Our previous hosting provider had a trusted CA issued cert installed on the origin server, and so we could simply point our internal DNS to the same public IP that CF was pointed to and everything would work fine. This new hosting provider insists on having a self signed cert on their side however. Why this is I&#x27;m still trying to figure out in my continued discussions with them, but for now that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve got and obviously that causes issues with &#x27;site unsecure&#x27; warnings if we set it up like we had done before.
 So what I was trying to do is simply point our internal DNS to the CF proxied route, and per here and here I was under the impression I could simply create a CNAME entry for www.domain.com and point it to www.domain.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. (see screenshot in attached album). But clearly I&#x27;m still missing something because even with that things aren&#x27;t working - Chrome gives an &quot;ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED&quot; error even though NSLOOKUP seems to resolve to the CF IP&#x27;s just fine (again, see screenshots in attached album). 
 Anyone dealt with a similar issue before? Thank you!!

                              <span>Hello,
 I was wondering if anyone here had a computer stipend for certain departments in your companies ? 
 I am trying to find out the pro/cons for letting engineers have their own stipend to pick out their computers vs we pick out their computers .
 Either way they would be required to have intune and follow compliance policies. It’s only a matter of whether they tell us what they want and we order it or we pick what they use.
 Would love to hear experiences and pro/cons

 I upgrade a VM from Configuration level 5.0-&gt;9.0 and it worked fine, except hyper-v didnt remove the snapshots, instead it created 4 VM&#x27;s off the VM&#x27;s snapshot. VM&#x27;s that when i try to delete says it doesnt exist, or throws an error when trying to open.

 I&#x27;m not sure what to do about this? I cant delete, or &#x27;open&#x27; them i just get errors. Any ideas?

                              <span>DoctorGPT is a lightweight self-contained binary that monitors your application logs for problems and diagnoses them. 
 I kicked-off the project after running some experiments which showed that GPT4 does a pretty good job diagnosing errors in logs if given enough context. 
 Thoughts and feedback are very much appreciated!

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have been lurking for some time, and now could really use some good advice.
 The story is, we are a retail chain with around 15 stores, 2 offices and a large online presence. I came onboard about 3 years ago with the responsibility for our ERP, Azure hosting and web team. The other guy took care of all hardware, some support and the odd jobs that came up. Between us we also took care of all the different hardware and software people use. We have around 200 employees across parttime to fulltime.
 The other guy was beginning to slack a bit, came in late and did not always do his tasks, so the CEO had made a plan with me where I should be the head of IT in 6 to 12 months and we should hire more people, at minimum a Sysadmin and a Supporter.
 We had not yet presented the plan for my colleague.
 Yesterday they found my colleague dead in his apartment, and I got a call from the CEO about it, where he stated that I was now head of IT and should start as soon as possible.
 My plan is to start securing we have access to all the systems he worked with, and create a common password database in something like Bitwarden. Then talk to all the different departments about what projects they had going on, and how to get support moving forward.
 I could really use some advise, where would you guys start?
 Rest in piece other guy, I will keep your lasts sessions online for as long ass possible. You will be missed.

 I think it should be a quite common issue with it people :)

                              <span>So you may have seen my post a few weeks ago about cyber insurance deeming MFA on every single admin device, network equipment, accounts etc. We’re slowly working down our list of stuff that we need to action, but as I am not that clued up on network, our manager is the one responsible for the network and network switches across all our offices. Some of these switches are 10-20 years old, and absolutely cannot support any form of MFA, even RADIUS. The rest of the team saw this as a great opportunity for a use case to replace these old switches with something more modern and would be compliant with our requirements. Our manager has grown to have a bit of a reputation within the team of just being lazy, and only wants to touch what he knows. Whilst our insurance deems it a requirement to protect these switches with MFA, the argument we got back was “what are they going to do? Look what device is plugged in?”
 Apart from the fact these switches are almost 20 year old so have obvious security flaws in them anyway, what would the worst case scenario be if someone malicious had access to a switch within a network?

                              <span>Hi does anyone have experience with DAC cables for this switch. l need 100gbe and 25gbe. I&#x27;d like to order them off FS.com but they don&#x27;t support HPE. Since this is rebranded Mellanox would that type of cable work? The HPE cables are insanely expensive. Maybe DAC isn&#x27;t the right direction and I need to do transceivers. I have this switch in the middle with Intel XX710- Nics in my server and a IBM FlashSystem 5200 as the SAN

                              <span>We have a handful of machines who suddenly stopped syncing OneDrive. After troubleshooting they are all stuck on the same screen. “We can’t sync your OneDrive….” “Sorry we can’t add your OneDrive right now”
 It appears to be machine specific. Users can login to another machine and OneDrive is OK. Also users can login to a broken machine and cannot sync.
 Things we have tried:
 OneDrive reset
 OneDrive uninstall/reinstall
 Manually delete all OneDrive appdata and sync folders
 Office repair and uninstall/reinstall
 We do not have restrictions to only allow syncing on PCs joined to specific domains
 SARA reports the issue is OneDrive account not signed in
 Settings on this page OneDrive sync error Sorry, OneDrive can’t add your folder right now - SharePoint | Microsoft Learn
 We do have a ticket open with MS support, but hoping someone else has experienced this before.

                              <span>Hi,
 At my desk i currently have my work macbook pro and my personal macbook pro. 
 The macbooks are hooked up to a lenovo usb-c dock for my monitor and ethernet. When i wanna switch from my work system to my home system i just unplug the usbc and replug. 
 Is there any way i can have a usb-C switch? So i can leave them both plugged in and just flip between them to toggle the connection.
 I tried googling but I’m unsure of what the name for a cable/device would be.
 I should also mention it needs to allow power delivery, display, network and usb
 Thanks

                              <span>Like many others we moved to use “known folder move” some time ago. As part of that we set up two things: 1. A baseline in sccm to check folders are in the expected locations. Eg. C:\users\Geoff\onedrive - contoso\desktop (or pictures or documents) 2. The admin reports policy so we can use the reports at confit.microsoft.com
 We hit go and watched with glee as the admin report went from 0% to around 90%. Never got to 100.. and forgot about it all as we moved to more important things.
 Now I’m reviewing our settings and status and I’ve found a couple of weird things
 Firstly some users have moved their folders into random folders, or so it would seem, like into the sub folder of some obscure project. Too few to be a mis configuration, too many for it to be accidental drag and drops.
 Secondly the admin reports have gone backwards, sitting at 75% or so
 Has anyone else had these experiences? Are you doing any manual remediation on these things? Should I be worried about any of this?!

 Thanks.

I&#x27;ve seen it done both ways and I have an opportunity to rebuild our core MDU rack at work so I&#x27;m looking for pros/cons to doing it one way or the other.
 To clarify, I&#x27;m looking to compare these two different rack layouts:

                              <span>Hi, I have been building PC&#x27;s for gaming for quite sometime now but I havent done anything on a server yet. I did buy a server for my SME back in 2019 which sadly broke down about 2months ago. After testing thoroughly and going to multiple stores that said they can fix this server. I found out its the board and the cpu that died and since Dell emailed back telling me that theres nothing they&#x27;ll do because it was a few month after the warranty ended and fixing would cost as much as buying it new any board/cpu I should know that would fit right with the components I already have? I remember back when I was reusing dell&#x27;s gaming pc, the mb would have its front io pins which will not work with normal pc cases in the market. I did find my way around by buying front IO cables from china that was modified for dell&#x27;s front IO. I am not sure if I am wasting my time trying to fix this server, will it be difficult to find a board that fits the case? 
 The server was a EMC R340 bought in 2019 with Xeon E 2124 + R171TT1 MB 17086-1

                              <span>Hello everyone, our Domain Controller currently handling all DHCP services and I would like to use Meraki. The reason I want to use Meraki is that we randomly have users connection drop and the event log points to DHCP, what I want to know are there any risks or drawbacks using Meraki to handle giving out IP&#x27;s instead of the Domain Controller.

                              <span>I work for a small manufacturing company (30~ employees) that I have volunteered myself to upgrade our network hardware and manage it when needed. We have around 60 devices on the network at any given time during the day. 10 VOIP phones, 15 computers, a few printers, employee phones (on a separate VLAN), ect. We only have 100Mb down and 10Mb up through Comcast. Before I upgraded us to our ubiquiti hardware we had some really bad latency and speed issues. 
 TLDR: if now one is complianing about speed issues is it worth us going to a faster speed? And is there a way to use the traffic statistics to get a better understanding of how much more we should upgrade if needed?

                              <span>Hey,
 I have four routers within the same AS and in all 4 routers, BGP is configured. Network &#x27;X&#x27; is advertised into BGP, R2 and R3 are working as Route reflectors. R2 is receiving &#x27;x&#x27; with a default local preference of 100. Now I want R3 to receive LP 150 so I applied the route map in the OUT direction on R2(towards R3). But R3 is still having local preference 100. I can see the change only if I applied the Route map in IN direction on R3. Same with origin code and metric. I can see changes only on applying the route map in IN direction.
 Why LP/origin/metric isn&#x27;t propagating from R2 in the update message?
 Sorry for my bad grammar.

                              <span>Hi, the following scenario came into my mind, when reading about dynamic routing/tunneling when providing a backup path to a destination.
 In the example there should be one backup path with only static routing to the destiantion, but it should react to a topology change and use the backup path(floating route). The backup/floating static route has a Administrative Distance (AD) of 5 and the primary route an AD of 1.
 https://postimg.cc/ygzqnK5H
 So, if the traffic is tunneld over IPsec (or other tunneling protocol) and the primary tunnel interface goes down, then the static route with an AD of 1 is removed from both routing tables and the second tunnel with the floating static route is used? 
 Is scenario 2 a possible solution to solve scenario 1? 
 Do vendors like cisco or fortinet behave the same way, when scenario 2 is configured?

                              <span>I bought a used Cradlepoint IBR 600C that came factory reset. I logged into it using the default username &quot;admin&quot; and the password printed on the bottom of the device. It worked
 Found that most of the settings were locked without a license. So I figured I&#x27;d downgrade the firmware from 7. whatever (don&#x27;t remember the version) to the oldest version I can find on their website, 6.3.2
 Now the device won&#x27;t accept the password that previously worked. I did not change any other settings except the DNS servers from the default since everything else is locked.
 What exactly did I do wrong? The device has no WAN connection what so ever.

                              <span>Hey everyone, we currently have a syslog server that we use to help monitor our network. Part of the syslog messages that we depend on is &quot;received bytes and sent bytes&quot; to determine bandwidth usages. This works fine for Juniper/Watchguard/Sonicwalls but now we are trying to add a Meraki MX into the mix and we can get all the info we want from it forwarded to syslog besides the bytes.
 Apparently Cisco only sends that info through Netflow. So I don&#x27;t really want to purchase an enterprise Netflow collector just for this small bit of information. I don&#x27;t need a fancy analyzer or anything, just something that is able to collect and forward the info we want. I have looked into a couple via Google and other posts (like ntopng) but haven&#x27;t had much luck getting this working so far. Any ideas/tips are appreciated!

                              <span>I am seeking input from those with Cumulus Linux experience. Does it have port isolation features? I have went through the documentation on Nvidia Hub and to be honest their documentation is awful, I have not seen any topics on port isolation or PVLAN although it seems like it would be possible in linux bridge but I don&#x27;t know it its integrated into switchdev and would be offloaded to the ASIC.
 Ideally I would like to have hybrid ports with untagged and tagged that are isolated from each other but able to communicate with the privileged port. Most implementation examples I see are for ONYX OS and it assumes that the restricted ports are access only. Yes it&#x27;s non typical but needed in this particular situation. TIA

                              <span>Hello, I am reaching out because I have a customer where all of their 25Gbit SFP28 links port flap connected to a Cisco ACI (that both leafs had been replaced already in.)
 The daughtercard is:
 ConnectX-4 Lx 25 GbE SFP28
 The SFPs are: SFP28-25G-SR-NOF (but I&#x27;m not sure if FEC is enabled)
 I read that the DFE tuning delay can cause the adapter to not link up when it isn&#x27;t set to 3000ms, but the ports are still flapping for some unknown reason, and that seems more like a complete loss of network scenario. 
 Can FEC when mismatched on the switch and server side cause a port flap?
 The links would also not link up with the link speed forced to 25gbit, they will only link with auto negotiation.
 At one point, all of the adapters flapped at the same time.
 ​
 Any advice appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to configure this net:
  
3 Tagged VLANS
 1 Untagged VLAN (Default)
 Fortinet 60F Router
 Allied Telesis x510 (52 ports) Switch
  
All VLANS are connected from the router to the switch with a single cable (port that I have configured as promiscuous). Subsequently, I have configured the rest of the ports through the interface as &quot;Untagged&quot; ports by groups according to which VLAN I want each port to receive. 
 As I understood, with this, I should be able to connect a PC to any of the ports assigned to a VLAN (tagged or untagged) and the computer would receive internet without having to configure the VLAN ID on the network card of the computer.
 Also, I need some ports to offer multiple VLANS so that I can configure APs with guest wifi that cannot access the rest of the network.
 However, I only receive internet on the ports that I have not configured a specific VLAN.
 What am I misising? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey,
 Quick question, how do I go about finding network engineer roles which are more focused on network automation ? I&#x27;m barely getting any matches on job boards when I search &quot;network automation&quot; and &quot;netdevops&quot;. 90% of the traditional senior/network engineer roles I see just say python or ansible is a plus.
 From what it looks like I may have to just get lucky ? and find a company that either is about to start this journey or already has started and looking for engineers to join the team.
 I&#x27;m using indeed and linkedin for my job searches.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>Hey all,
 Just got done upgrading the Hyper-V servers to a new windows version. I went to go upgrade the config version of the VM from 5.0-&gt;9.0 and it worked just fine.... except it created 3 VM&#x27;s from its snapshots using the name of its backups? i waited probably a good bit of time and they just aren&#x27;t going away.
 It created 3 VMs with names like:
 &quot;Auto Backup 4/5/2023&quot; - this was the names of its snapshots.
 What is this and is it safe to delete?
 ​
 EDT: it wont let me delete.

                              <span>So I am running Windows 11 Pro and have Hyper-V installed to run a few VMs. All of my Windows VMs have &#x27;Secure Boot&#x27; enabled with &#x27;Microsoft Windows&#x27; template selected and are not bitlocked.
 Tomorrow, I have a replacement motherboard coming as this one has a bad USB controller. Do I need to do anything to those VMs or even my Windows 11 host before I swap the boards? Host is also the same, not bitlocked, just secure boot enabled. I am worried that the swap is going to break boot because of the TPM settings.
 Any guidance on this would be appreciated.

 We have 600 legacy &#x27;programs&#x27; that have embedded credentials so they can be installed without admin rights. (can&#x27;t get rid of the at this point sadly...) 
 We&#x27;ve recently started a shift from onprem AD to azure with autopilot, and our domian name changed. Let&#x27;s call them:
 CompanyOnPrem. com
 CompanyCloud. com
 The embedded ID authenticates against CompanyOnPrem. com\account1. This account is synchronized with AzureAD so it has the correct rights in CompanyCloud, but of course the programs won&#x27;t install because CompanyOnPrem is also embedded in the install file. 
 HOWEVER! If I open anything (run CMD as a different user/admin) on the device using the CompanyCloud as the domain just once, now all the install files work perfectly.
 To summarized: 
 File has CompanyOnPrem. com\account1 embedded &amp; will not install. 
 Open CMD as account1@CompanyCloud. com and close it. Now all install files work fine. 
 It&#x27;s like running it once is creating a pointer or a DNS rescored that redirects the authentication - which is actually great for us. 
 Does anyone know specifically what is happening and where these credentials are stored?

                              <span>While clearing out some old files I found a transcript of some tech support I needed from a video conference software supplier. I&#x27;d just got the problem with a mis-configured account solved and were winding the call up when this conversation happened:
 Tech (27/03/2020, 11:03:10): Stay safe
 Me (27/03/2020, 11:03:21): And you, home work is getting boring 
 Tech (27/03/2020, 11:03:27): yes a bit 
 Tech (27/03/2020, 11:03:48): but for us its bombarded 
 Me (27/03/2020, 11:04:13): look after your mental health as well as physical, one tech to another 
 Tech (27/03/2020, 11:04:18): :) You are such a nice person 
 Tech (27/03/2020, 11:04:45): Thanks a lot
 I only wish I knew how much of a crap show it would turn out to be...I also wish I had more time to talk to the Tech, but I was getting hammered by all the people who had never worked remotely before and could not get the local / remotely connected PC concept straight.

I told them I have the appx package and they should be able to dump that into SCCM and push it out. They keep telling me it won&#x27;t work, but when I ask why, they won&#x27;t tell me.

After creating a user&#x27;s email account and logging them in i have to go and sit with the individual to create their email signature. Is there a way that this can be automated like after creation of an email account just pick name, job titile and phone number then slap it into a template so that the email signature appears on web email and outlook email.

                              <span>Started a new job recently that suffers from not having any processes or procedures in place. Things like &quot;change management&quot; are actively avoided by senior staff because &quot;it&#x27;ll just slow us down&quot;. I try to advocate that a functional change control process should not slow down change but encourage it.
 Additionally, we had an incident occur with one of our services recently and while the response was ok, nothing was written down by my team members. No incident ticket, no post-incident review, nothing. Service is back up, incident over. I&#x27;d assume that each person has their own personal notepad++ open to write down the incident response notes.
 My direct suggested I make a proposal things I would like implement, i.e. a system for tracking changes, ongoing problems, incidents etc. but as I&#x27;m writing the proposal I find myself wondering what I&#x27;m even doing. It&#x27;s obvious that this isn&#x27;t even a priority for higher ups so I&#x27;m probably just wasting time right? 
 Maybe I&#x27;m getting in my own head too much, maybe I&#x27;m frustrated this keeps happening at every IT department:(

 There are of course existing tools to change zone files, but the ones I could find don&#x27;t support arbitrary RFC 1035 zone files, or when they do, they insist on reformatting everything because they parse the old one and generate a completely new one - messing up any carefully cra…</span>

                              <span>Long time lurker, first time poster. Looking for any advice from my peers.
 On-premise Exchange 2016, active sync and web accss enabled email account. Have an MSP for Network config and support, no access to firewall or network monitoring.
 User reports one morning her account is locked, unlock it, locked again within a minute. Go through the normal steps; make sure your phone isn’t locking you account, logged into another device, etc.
 Logs reveal Exchange is the source of the lockouts, try disabling web access, OWA, and active sync for this user. Lockouts continue. Escalate for Network help from MSP.
 They determine it’s coming from overseas multiple IPs, etc. I ask if we can Geo Lock, block it, or whatever their recommendation is. I also asked why if Web Access is disabled that the login attempts matter.
 They confer with the IT Manager and decide to have me change the user account name to [username]2. I protest that this isn’t really a fix as much as ignoring the problem. Decision made.
 I change user account to (2), and then resolve the issues with connected apps because they are now a new account for many apps. Also reset and re-enroll users MDM controlled cell phone. Issue is “resolved”.
 I don’t like this solution, but I don’t know how to explain why to the IT Manager or what I should have expected from the MSP. If anyone is willing, please give me some advice.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Sorry this is slightly off topic. I work for a large organization that occasionally has phone numbers marked as &quot;spam&quot;. We usually find out about this after a customer mentions it. We&#x27;ll test on various personal cell phones and submit removal requests to carriers, and they remove the flag. 
 This only happens once or twice a year. We follow pretty strict anti-spam call policies, but sometimes they still get marked. 
 Is there an API that we can use to check numbers daily? I&#x27;ve tried Twilio&#x27;s phone-number lookup endpoint, but I don&#x27;t think it will give spam signals. We even signed up for a &quot;phone number reputation&quot; service that did absolutely nothing to protect our numbers. 
 Would love to know what others are doing to monitor their brand&#x27;s phone number reputations.

                              <span>When your company implemented cloud storage, do you have the end user store everything in the cloud or do you have a rule that items such as highly confidential be stored on the company server?
 If storing all files in the cloud, what was the &quot;sales pitch&quot; or reading that made your company say they were ok with saving the Excel file with employees benefit choices (i.e. the highly confidential file)

                              <span>Hi all,
 Not sure if this is an issue that any of you face, but how do you monitor changes the Terms of Use for your suppliers?
 We currently use approximately 1,000,000* SaaS products, along with a frankly extremely difficult ISP, who all follow the trend of: &quot;Our ToS are at this url, it&#x27;s on you to check it regularly, you have 30 days to kick up a fuss when we change them to be worse&quot;
 Do you use a product to monitor these web pages? If so what do you use? And if not would there be some value for you in someone making one in their downtime? I am considering making something just for my own purposes, but if there&#x27;s a market I&#x27;ll happily release it. 
 *number may be blatant hyperbole

 I have read Microsoft&#x27;s documentation and I&#x27;m not getting a clear answer, or maybe I&#x27;m not understanding how these work. Here&#x27;s what I have:
 I have security defaults turned off as I&#x27;m using conditional access. I have enabled all the suggested default CA policies that enable all the things the Security Defaults does. Under Authentication methods for MFA I have &quot;Microsoft Authenticator&quot; Enabled &#x3D; Yes and Targeted to &quot;All Users.&quot; All other methods are Enabled &#x3D; No which is the default other than Email OTP which I believe is required for Guest users to login to a SharePoint site or something like that. The Email OTP isn&#x27;t relevant for my questions.
 First question: I have a few global admin users and those users can use the software TOTP feature in our password manager and are not req…</span>

 What do you think what would be kind of best practice network security events to be monitored, both external or internal in an enterprise environment?
 For example network scanning, impossible travel of user, brute forcing an account login...etc

                              <span>Hi all was considering starting a Cybersecurity journey which lead me to potentially getting CCNA knowledge, which led me to have a look at sysadmin or network based professions. Have gone through a fair a mount of the Wiki and just had a question:
 Is the advice in the Wiki for the most part still relevant? A lot of the posts it links to are are roughly a decade old and I was wondering if the advice from those posts would still hold up today.
 I understand the requirement to be constantly learning and updating skills in the field and that it is not for everyone, but I would just like to know if what I read through is still a good starting point.
 I am just considering my options as I wish to get out of my current position (retail management). I used to have a pretty strong passion for IT but it kind of died with my current career.
 Cheers.

Years ago, a third party we had partnered with requested a couple CNAME records pointed at host names they would control. 
 Later,we partnered with someone else and they took over services and we redirected the CNAMEs to them. Later still they stopped using the hostnames the cnames referenced and we never got final authorization to terminate the cnames. 
 Last month a flurry spam sent by ip addresses authorized by someone who set up an spf record the cnames now pointed at got sent out. We have since created subdomains matching the old cname records, set up our own spf, dkim and dmarc records for them and for *.subdomain.domain.com and now a…</span>

The build should be simple 70+ tors and 2 DC cores to add a few remote sites (DR, remote offices, etc) later on. Full mesh spine/leaf and for now layer 2 adjacent. That may change later.

 I’m working on the creation of a Cloud Service Provider (and Internet Service Provider). I had installed Netbox, to have a source of truth (and documentation). 
 How can I design vlan usage ? 
 I though about this format : 2-999 : Internal 2-99 : Network Management 500-599 : Cloud Management 1000-1999 : Customers 4000-4094 : Testing
 Thanks for your advices !

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to have to make one of the biggest choices of my life and I keep going back and forth. I&#x27;m in the military and my contract is about to end, and I&#x27;ve set myself up to be decently comfortable doing DOD networking without a uniform. I have a degree, Sec+, CCNA, and hopefully about to pass my ENCOR. I really enjoy networking and want to get paid what I&#x27;m worth since enlisted military doesn&#x27;t get paid very well. I&#x27;d like to get ENARSI soon after because it sounds fun, but even studying for the ENCOR I see how much emphasis Cisco puts on their products and automation and I really just don&#x27;t get much joy from learning all that. I&#x27;m also unsure how AI and automation is going to affect the networking career field 10, 20 years from now.
 If I choose to go the cyber security route I&#x27;d have to reenlist for another 4 years and live a restrictive life with bad pay - but I&#x27;d be put on the path for some cool defensive cyber operation skills. I&#x27;d get schooling, certifications, and be working with a very very exclusive club. As far as I can tell, these guys get paid more than networking guys too. 
 I know there&#x27;s a lot of people with much more experience and knowledge than me here and I was hoping maybe you could tell me something that would sway me into one direction or another.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 So I&#x27;ve worked in &quot;Networks&quot; for almost 9 years now (wow it&#x27;s gone fast!). The first 4 years I was your traditional networking engineer/admin working mainly on Datacentre and a little bit of Enterprise networks which I enjoyed but found the pace and travelling a bit stressful, although I think that was mainly due to the work culture i was in. I left that role in a hurry as the company took a turn for the worst and I got a Systems Engineering role focused on communications(networks). I&#x27;ve been here for nearly 5 years now and I find it quite mundane and none challenging and the pay is quite a bit lower compared to engineers working in I.T.
 I have considered going back into I.T but as ive been away from the CLI and &quot;traditional&quot; networking for a while I feel like I won&#x27;t be able to. I guess you could say I&#x27;ve traded my hands on experience for more theory knowledge, understanding protocol standards, more physical layer including RF and the innerworkings of network devices and how they are integrated into a system of systems rather than end users. I know this is quite a unique situation but just wondering if any one has done something similar? Or has any opinions on me being able to get another job in I.T. Happy to answer more detailed questions if needed.

                              <span>Finally decided to join this subreddit in a sleepless night. Long time lurker already.
 I am curious: What devices do you use for NAT/Routing at the Uplink of big Networks (like 20 Gbit/s, 60k Clients). Currently we‘re using MikroTik CCR1072 for it, but recently discovered Netgate TNSR. For Switches, we are a complete HPE-Shop and would consider MikroTik to prosumer for the task, but somehow, we ended up with this white box in our biggest core rack … Our smaller setups use Sophos Systems, but we feel like they‘re not purpose built to be fast packet-spitting roaring routing machines.

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering a small FTTH build and I&#x27;d like to get a feel for which vendors have the best reputation and should make my short list.
 Right now I understand that Adtran and Nokia are probably the leaders but how do Calix and some of the other solutions (like Juniper Unified PON) compare?
 Based on my limited experience and research, Adtran seems to be the winner here for smaller deployments like my planned one but maybe there is something I don&#x27;t know?
 I know about Ubiquiti Networks PON platform already and it&#x27;s a possibility but I&#x27;d like to invest in something a bit more in line with what some of the other operators around me are using rather than be a one-off (even if that&#x27;s the way I end up going in the end).
 Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>Hi! I have a problem during the stacking configuration of two FS S3910-48TS. I followed all the instructions taken from an official FS manual, you can find the related info on page 1606 under the Configuring Stacking in the Standalone Mode section.
 The switches are brand new, I tried the setup with no stacking fiber cables connected and with the cables connected too.
 I can execute every command fine, but when I get to execute
 ​
  
FS(config-vsl-port)#port-member interface Tengigabitethernet 0/49
  
​
 I get this error back:
 ​
  
Port tengigabitethernet 0/49 could not be configured to vsl. 
 Port check failed.
  
​
 I tried other ports but I get the same error, what can I do? Someone who had experience with this vendor switch? The switches are brand new with default configuration out of the box.

                              <span>Hi all, hoping someone can help me. I’m trying to find a HP SFP matrix similar to the Cisco one. I’ve got the following switches. JG924A-1920-24G (Non-PoE), HP JD992A V1905-24-POE, and looking to get a HP ProCurve V1810-48G. The 48 port will be going in my loft, as will the PoE switch (this is only for cameras and sensors hence the 100mb ports) so I need the SFPs and a short fibre cable between those. Then I need SFPs between the 48G and the 24G, the fibre cable will have to run about 50 meters. If anyone can point me to which ones I need that also won’t break the bank it would be much appreciated. Tia.

                              <span>I have to communicate with a set of wifi enabled electrical relay switches and video monitors around the perimeter of a field. Since the maximum ethernet range is about twice the range as wifi, it seemed like it would be easy to use the wifi access points as ethernet repeaters if I can find the right units and daisy chain them around the field. Power is easily available the whole way. Is this a good way to do it? If so, what are good wifi units that would let me do this?

HR won&#x27;t write a retention policy so we can&#x27;t remove older emails and I have no say over budget/purchasing so I&#x27;ve just floated this up to my manager to deal with. I even suggested exporting older emails and storing them elsewhere. 
 When our email archive went offline previously, O365 queued emails and sent them when it was back online (~1 hour) but I&#x27;m not able to find any documentation on this.

Just yesterday he, just replied back to the Microsoft ticket and cc&#x27;d me in, saying, I have privileges for on premise exchange.. I am not your backup.. cc&#x27;d me into the support email even without letting me know in advance.. that&#x27;s rude! My team as system admin has privileges for almost 99% of all system.. what do you think? I have 0 experience with exchange. I know the Microsoft support will drive any meeting. But I feel like it&#x27;s not my responsibility, I don&#x27;t want to take the responsibility. And my manager is not cc&#x27;d in the email loop...

                              <span>This was like 15 years ago. We had a client come in that was the most sexist human being I&#x27;ve ever met and I have worked with people from all levels of wealth and from like 30 countries.
 It was him, me, and our site manager(a woman) in a conference room with him sitting across from me and the site manager sitting next to each other. Every time the site manager asked a question, he would make it quite clear that he was responding to me because he was disgusted that a woman was in charge of the site. It was insane to watch and be the person he chose over responding to a lowly woman. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I was young and new to the company. If it happened now, I&#x27;d be all, yo, this is unacceptable but where I was in my life at that time, I chose the passive aggressive route.
 You really have to picture this in your head because it really went down this way.
 She would ask a question, he would look at me to respond, and I slowly leaned over until my head was behind hers so he had to at least look in her direction while speaking.
 She was clearly and understandably appalled at the situation but she was also trying not to laugh at what I was doing.
 Side note: The primary owner of our company is awesome and later that day told that guy to gtfo of our building and our contract was cancelled.

                              <span>The switches/APs/Firewalls you use, how you manage multiple sites (if you do) and so forth
 We&#x27;re currently using Meraki, and I&#x27;m not overly keen on it. Crazy expensive hardware and licenses, increasingly common hardware failures, pretty average feature sets. Yet somehow it sort of just works. We can create a site to site VPN easily, manage switches and APs and firewalls from anywhere, and I have to say, I like that. 
 I was looking at potential other solutions. From their marketing, you would think Ubiquiti would be a good choice - absolutely not, I wouldn&#x27;t use their stuff outside of SOHO or prosumer environments. With the possible exception of HP Aruba, it looks like most alternatives means leaving that single ecosystem that I&#x27;ve actually come to take for granted to an extent. Perhaps renewing the licenses next year is the best plan?
 But in any case, I&#x27;m interested to know how other people manage their networks!

                              <span>This is an odd request, but please hear me out. My company provides control panels with very small (like 2-3 device) isolated TCP/IP networks. Occasionally, a device needs to be serviced by connecting a laptop with programming software installed. This software interacts over a TCP/IP connection with the devices in the panel. The software is expensive, difficult to install, and difficult to license. It is not something we could just send an installer to our customers to install on a local laptop, most of the time. Furthermore, asking to remote into a customer&#x27;s machine would be seen as unprofessional in this industry.
 I may post a similar question on /r/plc where I normally hang out, but I am looking for something more than the current ways I&#x27;ve seen/done this:
  
VERY EXPENSIVE - drive or fly to the site just to plug in an ethernet cable to the laptop with the right software on it.
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send a laptop with the software installed to site with instructions for site personnel to get it connected to the panel&#x27;s switch. This ties up a full set of software licenses (this can be 5 figure licenses)
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send or permanently install a dedicated cellular VPN box (usually netbiter, eWon or Secomea) out that puts the engineer&#x27;s licensed laptop on the panel&#x27;s network
 LOWEST EXPENSE - if the customer has the right combination of competency and flexibility in their IT dept, set up VPN access to the network 
  
Ok, so here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a 5th option. Is there a way to set up a laptop that just functions as a VPN server, rather than client. Like, is there a cisco or whatever program I can install on a win10/11 laptop that, when running, allows remote vpn clients to access the laptop&#x27;s local network? 
 All of the above is typically done as supervised, extremely temporary connections to these systems. I am aware these all represent security risks except #1. Please refrain from chastising my industry for our security practices.

                              <span>Cisco switches seem so damn expensive. With so many competitors out there, why do they still dominate the enterprise market? I’ve always worked in Cisco environments, and they’re great. But what brands are quality alternatives for enterprise and for small business?

                              <span>I work maybe 6-7h each day, really not that much compared to what I read from other guys in this sub. However during that time I am hyper focused. The only break that I take is 30 minutes for lunch, and I mean really no other break at all. I don’t kick back in my seat, take care of personal stuff or get up to walk around the room for a bit. Instead I jump from one task to the next, whether that’s a meeting, monitoring alert, ticket, project, chat message, email, you name it. The stimulation is just so intense that I can’t get out once I’m in. What I don’t realize during that time is that I’m completely overstimulating by brain. I don’t give it time to process anything. So once I stop working my mind starts racing about everything I touched throughout the workday. I go over the meeting in my head, I think about if I forgot something on the ticket I worked on, if the next steps for the project are correct, etc. I go to bed with these thoughts and I wake up with them. Only after about 2 days of not working (typically on Sundays or today after a holiday) the thoughts start to slow down. This really sucks because I am not fully present with my family unless I’m on holiday and generally I’m just burning myself out. I know what I shouldn’t be doing but I just can’t stop it. I tried a couple of things to mitigate that:
  
A physical alert on my desk which goes off after 2h to remind me to get up (which I happily ignore once I’m into the vortex)
 A tool on my computer which actually blocks the screen for 5 minutes to force a break (which annoyed me too much when I was deep into something or in a meeting)
 Countless of post-its to remind me of breaks (which you guessed it, I ignore)
  
Have any of you experienced the same and found a solution to this?
 PS: I should mention that neither my boss or any external factor are forcing this behavior on me. While I had jobs in the past where that was the case, today it’s not.

 It took multiple times and rewrites of instructions to even get them to install the AV and remote software. The migration from their e-mail system to O365 from a technical standpoint was pretty smooth. However we are getting a lot of users saying its slow, mail isn&#x27;t loading as it should etc etc
 I understand there is a cultural language and time barrier, and I&#x27;ve pleased with leadership to send me over there to get a better grasp on things and their userbase and workflows. I guess I am more venting than anything because I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to help them out.

                              <span>Hi
 In a few month we move to a shiny new office. We will have great collab spaces but we wont have personal desks anymore, which is fine for us.
 We will have two identical 4K 27inc displays daisy chained and connect one USB-C/Thunderbolt cable to our laptops.
 Given we move between desks, will people with every new desk have to change their display order/orientation or is there a trick to it?
 All ideas are very welcome!

                              <span>Hi everyone. I have been tasked with bringing my building into the 21 century.
 We now have keyless entry, voip phones, and some wifi. Problem all these devices use POE and I have three floors to cover. So I have switches on three floors. The switches are older surplus 3com which were donated. (we are a non-profit fraternal org). 
 I would like to get my infrastructure on one one type of hardware at a reasonable price. 
 Number of office employees is only 4. But when members show up we need ability to serve up wifi .
 Most of the device connections are POE devices, doors, phones, ap&#x27;s .
 Looking for switch and ap recommendations. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi there.
 We currently utilize Barracuda for our Third Party Spam Filtering. MX-&gt;Barracuda-&gt;O365.
 The only inbound connector we have is scoped to only accept mail from Barracuda IPs.
 Mail Rule to set the SCL to -1 when mail is received from Barracuda IPs to ensure O365 scanning is bypassed.
 We recently upgraded our Microsoft Licensing which allows additional email security on the O365 Side. 
 While Barracuda does a pretty good job at keeping the bad-guys away, I&#x27;m considering layering *some* of the scanning/security such that any email that comes into our organization, first passes through Barracuda for Scans, then an additional scan is done at the O365 level before delivering to the user mailbox.
 Seeing the recommendation is to enable Enhanced Filtering.
 https://campus.barracuda.com/product/emailgatewaydefense/doc/96023002/enhanced-connectors-vs-mail-flow-rules-for-spam-filtering/
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/enhanced-filtering-for-connectors#what-happens-when-you-enable-enhanced-filtering-for-connectors
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud#scenario-1---mx-record-points-to-third-party-spam-filtering
 ​
 I&#x27;m assuming this is a modification to the existing inbound connector to enable Skip Listing, and the SkipIPs then become a list of IPs that Barracuda uses - essentially allowing us to keep the scoping in place for the connector to only allow Barracuda IPs. We would then &#x27;remove&#x27; the SCL-1 rule.
 While this might come with some additional management - I can see the benefits of having an integrated filter in place (Impersonation etc etc).
 Anyone else setup this way? Pros? Cons? lessons learned?
 Appreciate the help.

                              <span>Hey Everyone. 
 I joined this company around 1.5 years ago. Great company, nice people and 100% remote. I was hired to manage a Windows environment and some small Azure related projects. Down the road last year, a few key people in the company quit and I had to step up to take more responsibilities especially for managing other cloud environments (AWS/Linux and some DevOps) and I was told at that time that they&#x27;ll look into getting a raise for me. I also got a few Azure/AWS certs and spent many extra hours to learn and manage these environments. Although, besides the regular 5% annual raise, there haven&#x27;t been any discussions around the raise. I really enjoy my time working here but I have been told by others to start looking somewhere else but my experience has been very good with the company, and also having imposter syndrome to apply elsewhere. Would like some advice on where to go from here. Thanks! Location: ON, CA. Sal: C$60k

                              <span>In Chrome I used the extension from DNSlytics long time, however it became broken a while ago. Since then I haven&#x27;t found any alternative with the same quality.
 Yes there are many similar extensions but most of them are not maintained anymore or broken unfortunately.
 Since these tools are mostly used by power users, I would like to know what you&#x27;re using?

 I worked in manufacturing for 6 years, was laid off and decided to get my associates in computer science. I’ve worked at a school district as an IT support specialist for over 3 years now. I love what I do, but believe it may be time to move on for more money/challenge. 
 Advice on next steps/certs to pursue??

 Many of us have used terminal programs like XCopy to transfer only a specific subset of files and to include/exclude only certain details such as modification dates, file permissions, etc. 
 Should operating systems include these types of functions into their GUI, possibly in the toolbar or elsewhere?

                              <span>So not sure if r/sysadmin is the right sub for this, but gonna try still
 We have a &quot;Cisco like&quot; 4 port router (not gonna get too into details on the router due to company stuff) and we&#x27;re using a satellite modem to reach back to another end. Our issue currently is that we magically had connectivity on the router for probably 2 minutes, then can&#x27;t ping the modem. We changed the FE 0/0 port to be in the same &quot;net&quot; as the modem (just changed it to a .3 because modem is a .1 and the dish controller is a .2) and was told to add &quot;ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1&quot; into our config but can&#x27;t even ping the modem anymore. Any thoughts? I&#x27;ll answer some questions if you have any, but will keep some stuff vague due to company stuff

                              <span>Hi guys, as suggested above. I&#x27;m looking for a keyboard + mouse combo. I&#x27;m in IT field as a Project Manager. So yes, there is a lot for excels, documentations etc. Looking for a keyboard mouse combo that fits the criteria below,
 It must have both Bluetooth and a unifying receiver. So that I can switch devices between my company laptop, personal tablet, and my Google TV. 
 For connecting to my company laptop, I would prefer to use a USB receiver. For connecting to my personal tablet and Google TV, I would need the Bluetooth connectivity. 
 So far I&#x27;m looking at the Logitech K375s keyboard + Logitech m720 triathlon. 
 Just wondering do you guys have any better recommendations?
 Thanks a ton man.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 i have been using session buddy for a while, in order to at least save the tabs i have setup for a browser. Since browsers have the ability to group tabs, i would love to save not only the tabs themselves but of course also the groups. Restoring tabs is not an issue, but having then to manually setup the groups and add the tabs is painfull (esp. across multiple devices). Session buddy does not do this. 
 Anybody know of an extension (chrome) that saves both? and maybe even syncs the profile + tabs + groups + extensions? 
 thanks in advance for any usefull hints :)
 Edit: I found the flag #tab-groups-save so i will test that (sadly it is experimental)

                              <span>Unpopular opinion: Too many people in IT have toxic work habits
 They act like people will die if they don&#x27;t stay late to complete whatever task. Then they come into work depressed the next day, expecting other staff to feel sorry for them for being the &quot;hero&quot; who worked late. Bad luck, no one notices because other staff are living their best lives.
 Reality check 1:
 Your job isn&#x27;t that important, you aren&#x27;t saving the world. And that&#x27;s OK.
 Reality check 2:
 Your boss is not your friend. If they were, they wouldn&#x27;t let you work late. They would care about your health and wellness.
 You are an employee. Work hard but go home on time. If your boss says there&#x27;s too much work, that&#x27;s a management problem. They need to hire more people. You still go home on time. If they don&#x27;t like that, find another job. I&#x27;ve been there. Yes, it&#x27;s really that simple. You are exchanging time for money. This is just a business transaction.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve setup Duo 2FA for RDP against my home devices which are public facing. Ever since I&#x27;ve popped my 3389 and 3390 ports open I&#x27;ve noticed brute force attempts in the security events logs. Pretty lame attempts at that, as they try different usernames with every attempt, with the occasional consistent administrator account. 
 I guess my question is, even if they were to successfully brute force my password, wouldn&#x27;t they hit the same 2FA prompt that I do when I access remotely? Would they be able to access any other areas of the network or devices? I also have all my devices running through NordVPN when home which blocks all external access.

                              <span>As part of our security policy, we have a highly segmented, firewall and switch routed network with next generation Web Application Firewalls.
 When setting up new servers, production machines, cloud services or new (client/server) applications, our firewall team needs to be involved. While that&#x27;s perfectly fine, it feels like a new endeavor every time, even if it&#x27;s the third or tenth machine of the same type.
 We need to specify source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols (and I&#x27;m happy with that), but don&#x27;t have a very structured and repeatable approach in doing so. And the firewall teams documentation of rules and changes &quot;in the firewall&quot; seems somewhat intransparent. That process is time consuming with repeated discussions on why we need this port or that protocol and we sometimes end up with issues because of that.
 Can you share or recommend a lean process on requesting, documenting, and auditing firewall rules? Please also point me to other reddits if I am a bit off topic here.

                              <span>Stayed patient after they told me they’re restructuring and will switch me from hourly to salary. I meant 6 months worth of patience supporting a workforce of 20 in house people and 80 remote. 
 I get no budget / spending power and they do not want to spend a PENNY on I.T / Sec. 
 I asked them if we can expand into an MSP space and they said yes, just to take it back after I signed clients and started working telling me “your job is on-demand because it’s break-fix and not full time” ( I AM THE ONLY ONE THERE AND YOUR COMPANY’s IT IS A DUMPSTER FIRE)
 I stayed patience up until yesterday where my boss assured me she’d have a compensation structure for me and the MSP vertical. I scheduled a resignation at 5:00 the next day because I knew she wouldn’t do anything and I gave them a week’s notice. 
 This is the text I got: “Your resignation is accepted and is effective immediately. Let’s coordinate a time this weekend to meet in order to go over any pending assignments and for you to transfer any assets you have to the firm. Also, please clean out your office by Sunday evening. 
 Thank you for your service and we wish you all the best in all of your future endeavors. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. 
 All the best!”
 And they sent an email not including me to the rest of the staff saying that my last day was today. Like dude, I quit, don’t make it sound like you fired me. 
 I’m trying hard to not exact revenge. I was too loyal is the problem.
 Not worth $20 / hr to have every position at the same time. I polished my resume and fucked out of there before the inevitable disaster.
 Please be blunt and tell me if I’m dumb. You may need more info, I had so much shit today I forgot 90% of it.
 EDIT: I see you and I’m upvoting I promise.

                              <span>So we Have Multiple Business units all with their Own AD Domains all syncing into a single Azure Tenant.

 All the BUs ADs all have 2019 DCs or Higher and the function levels are 2016 on Business units AD we have noticed an issue with users it would appear that some users are unable to access on prem resources via windows hello but others are, the Base Domain was originally a .local but all the users are assigned a doman.com upn so this should not be an issue. We tested today with a user who could not SSO and reach on prem resources and they haven&#x27;t been able to for months since they got a AADJ Device …</span>

                              <span>In the last few years I’ve seen so many issues with support but today was the cherry on top. 
 It’s been a day since we submitted a ticket for one of our customers and I have received almost nothing from them. I called to escalate early this morning. They tried to call apparently but I had no such calls come in and I’ve been at my desk since 730 am. I called again after they put the ticket on hold and requested they escalate again and reach out via email. They reached out via email requesting information and I provided everything they asked for immediately. Radio silence until I called again. Then I got an email saying my ticket has been escalated to tier 2 support. Radio silence yet again. It’s now been 30 hours since we put in the ticket and nothings happening. 
 The express ticketing status page went down around 12pm today so I can’t even see if someone’s actively working on it or not. I tried just scheduling a tech to come from the level 1 support but apparently that can’t happen without circuit team initiating it. Level 1 support somewhat admitted they have been having issues reaching the circuit team but when they saw my ticket they got audibly nervous so maybe it was just a mistake. 
 Other rant about AT&amp;T don’t let your equipment go down or they’ll give away your IPs and they won’t even give you DHCP til you call …if you can get a hold of them. Have a new customer that just got dedicated fiber from them I set up their network a month ago got the service online but they didn’t need it for a month and a power outage knocked them offline permanently but they didn’t know until it was time to use it. Took a week to get a technician to come in and reprovision the equipment.

                              <span>Question for the Linux admins out there: is it actually worthwhile to put effort into learning vi?
 I&#x27;ve spent most of my sys admin career in a primarily windows environment, but I&#x27;ve recently moved to a shop that&#x27;s about 50/50. Early in my career, I was advised to never bother, and just use nano instead, which works enough like a regular text editor that anyone can use it with no special training. 
 The problem is I now catch a lot side glances from the career Linux guys for using nano. The people who have primarily worked in Linux all seem to be VI guys.
 I haven&#x27;t really put effort into learning it, my vi knowledge is basically :q! If I accidentally open it.
 What do you guys think, is it actually something worth learning, or is it just a preference thing? Alternately, is it worth doing just as a marker for being a Linux pro?

                              <span>Hello all!
 I am sure many of you know what KnowB4 is. For those that don&#x27;t, it is a security awareness training program that helps users to take extra precautions when it come to opening emails and trickery of phishing and whatnot. 
 When we sent out a test campaign, and a user falls for it, they user will get a training class assigned to them where they&#x27;ll have to watch it and take a quiz helping them not fall for it again in the future. 
 We started this about a year ago, but lately we have users who get supper offended when they fall for one the campaigns that get sent to them and get really upset that they have to do the class and quiz. It is starting to really piss me off. They&#x27;re thanking we (IT) purposely are trying to make them fall for it so we can give them a shitty day. That isn&#x27;t the case. We are better safe than sorry. 
 What I need help with is who can draft me a crafty email explaining how it isn&#x27;t us against them and that this tool is there to help us all take extra precautions rather than feeling that IT is trying to make you fall for those tests. 
 Because as I am drafting the email, I finding it to be in a very pissed off tone which is making me hesitant to send it to the whole company. Who is good at making this email tone very firm and a**holic, but at the same time friendly? lol

I&#x27;ve done all that, but the &quot;Last checked date&quot; is 4 days old and I can&#x27;t find a way to manually recheck.
 Does anyone know how to manually refresh or initiate the DNS check for DKIM?

                              <span>To make a long story short, we had a DC setup as a Certificate Authority for LDAPs and eventually had Microsoft Support migrate from that server to an entirely new one so we could decommission the DC. 
 In trying to issue new certificate templates I noticed the option was greyed out which led me down a rabbit hole of issues (that I don&#x27;t completely understand) 
 When I look at the Root CA in certsrv, it&#x27;s got a name of the old DC hostname and not the new server host name. 
 ​
 Could this be my problem? Did Microsoft botch the migration? What can I do to rectify this, assuming the CA server needs to be the name on the cert

 Earlier this month I got a weird email from [registrar-support@google.com](mailto:registrar-support@google.com) which asked for a photo of my drivers license and a utility bill to &quot;verify my account&quot; which my email service (Gmail, also Google) decided was spam. I got another email last Friday stating that my Domains account was suspended. I immediately contacted support and they tipped me off to the first email.

 We are preparing in the event of spring run-off floods our Data Center. We have a DR / backup site but it is also a potential flood victim. But DR is less likely to flood.
 Preparing for the worst, hoping for the best.
 For the past few years we have been doing so called table top excersizes 2-3 times a year for events like this.

                              <span>Hello,
 It&#x27;s been a month since my internship has begun at an MSP. It&#x27;s a 100% remote position and most days, I do nothing except participate to 1 to 3 useless meetings.
 Of course, I already talked to my boss about it (I would say something like &quot;hey I have free time right now, If I can be of any help for anything please reach out to me&quot;) And when I say that, he would always ask someone in the team to call me on Teams to explain 2-3 projects they are working on, but it&#x27;s useless because each time they would not give me any work to participate in these projects, they are always waiting on dependencies to be solved by someone else so I just have to wait.
 My worst issue is the daily stand up meeting where I always have to make up something to talk about.
 Do you think it&#x27;s a common issue during an internship or at the beginning of a new job? I feel so bored. I was working on many exciting projects while I was a student and I miss this time so much.
 Sorry if my english is not perfect - french is my first language.

Poor spelling, lots of poor sentence structure in the original email

Everything is suspicious, it&#x27;s probably a phishing attempt right? Request denied.

 Turns out this was actually legit user-initiated communication, and the payment processor indeed utilizes proofpoint from that domain for its customer service.
 God damnit, this is why we drink.

                              <span>For various reasons, I need to start some trials with Windows 365. In looking at the cost for what they consider &#x27;standard&#x27; the 41.00 per month seems a bit high. I would like costs to be in the 20 to 25 per month if possible. I&#x27;m wondering if they are other vendors in this space doing anything similar that are reputable with similar specs. Windows 11 is a must, but it does not need to connect to local resources. Essentially, a Windows desktop accessible from any standard internet-connected computer. Ideally, I don&#x27;t want to host my own hardware, the environment would be desktop as a service. It may just be this is what the market is and that&#x27;s fine, but I wanted to cast a wider net and make sure I&#x27;m not missing something.

                              <span>All DCs are currently W2K16, but will be swapped out for all W2K19 in a few months. All DCs support only &quot;RC4, AES 128, AES 256&quot; encryption types (no DES). 
 Some AD accounts (mostly computer objects for Linux systems with Centrify agent installed) support only &quot;DES, RC4&quot;.
 Some other accounts (also Centrify systems) support &quot;DES, RC4, AES128, AES256&quot;. The rest (vast majority Windows systems, nothing lower than W2K12R2/Win10) of accounts don&#x27;t support DES at all. 
 Question 1: Without the DCs supporting for DES, is having &quot;DES&quot; as a supported type on a bunch of computer objects an actual risk item? We are logging everything into Splunk and there are zero events indicating DES is in use. These accounts turned up in an internal audit, but the actual risk seems non-existent. We will remediate them anyway but I&#x27;m wanting to be clear on the risk for management discussions. 
 Question 2: Right now in Splunk I see AES in use, but also RC4 being used, even involving systems that have support for AES128 and AES256. I think I&#x27;ve read that once we switch to W2K19 DCs this behavior will change, and the DCs will start negotiating with the highest encryption level available. Is that accurate? We want to work towards phasing out RC4, so if the above is true, we should immediately see a big drop in RC4 traffic after we swap out our DCs this summer.

                              <span>My friend works for Amazon. From what i understand work emails are private so no one outside of the network should know what it is right ? Well my friend received an email from someone outside of the network and they called him the N word . The person made a brand new email with the N word in it as well. Is there anything he can do about this ? Seems like there should be some kind of privacy protocol in place.

                              <span>A group policy was pushed out after removing the final legacy application (or so we thought).
 We we changed Network Security:LAN Manager Authentication Level to &quot;Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM and NTLM.&quot; After this, the help desk lost the ability to use UltraVNC for remote desktop support. Obviously, we don&#x27;t want to enable the old insecure policy just for VNC.
 Does anybody know how to force UltraVNC to use NTLMv2? My Google-Fu is failing me.

I wear noise canceling earphones,but their mic gets more noise than me. I tried some ear protection ear buds and they do the noise reduction, but their mics are not good
 Whet does the brain trust here like for voice comms in server rooms.

 But it was not until today I realized the 1st digit (or 1st 2 digits) of the part number was the generation! (forehead slap).
 (3 digit &#x3D; 1st gen, 4 digit &#x3D; 1st digit is the generation, 5 digit &#x3D; 1st 2 digits are the generation)

 For a bit of background, it is only my 3rd year in the work force and I currently work on an Identity Management team at a large hospital company in where we support the provisioning and de-provisioning of accounts (+ a whole lot more). This was my first job straight out of college after completing my B.S. in Computer Science. I cannot find enough good things to say about this job as they took me on with ZERO experience, good managers, awesome co-workers, and so much flexibility.

                              <span>In my past companies, I used Jira and Zendesk to organize tech support. The current startup wants to save money for the first time, so they are looking for something free or cheap.
 Expect to have the following functionality:
  
Ticketing system
 Online chat for the site and apps
 Built-in bot for online chat with customization options (desirable, but we can make our own).
 Customization (some kind of integration, apps or at least built-in functionality)
 Tools for metrics analysis (SLA, statistics, etc.).
  
We won&#x27;t have voice support, so we plan to communicate via online chat only. Also in the support will work no more than 5 employees in shifts in a 24 by 7 mode. If someone is away for lunch, the bot has to help somehow and create a ticket, so that the client does not just sit there.

                              <span>We have an orphaned exchange online mail box. The AD user was deleted some time ago. 
 Goal: remove user from ad synced distribution list in O365 
 what I have tried: 
 Created new on prem AD user
 SMTP soft linking (proxy address attributes and email field) - this created a second account if it synced at all) 
 Hard linking by setting azure identities immutable ID to the on prem object GUID by translating it from base 64…
 The GUIDS will not throw any errors on sync, it’s the duplicate UPN and SMTP:username fields that won’t sync and show duplicate errors. 
 I thought this was possible…
 Last idea - export PST and remake.

It&#x27;s reasonable to expect that I haven&#x27;t adapted to this way of working in the 6months I&#x27;ve been here but he literally expects me to be perfect.

                              <span>Hi, New to Azure AD sync, I can need some help.
 We have a AD on-prem server with multiple domain-names split per OU. We would like to set-up sync
 through AADConnect so that each OU gets its own Tenant sync.
 Do I have this right that I have to install one AADConnect per Tenant to make this happen? We have maybe 30 OU/domains to be potentially synced to individual Tenants. If this is the case do I need 30 instances of AADConnect? This does not sound right? But if this is the case what is best practices?
 Let me know if I have to clarify things. Thanks.

 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had a phishing campaign target users within our company, all the usual markers aren&#x27;t present, so this hasn&#x27;t been quarantined by our Email Gateway.
 Pretty much, each email sent comes from a different mail server (all &quot;good / neutral&quot; reputation), they&#x27;re all different in content, but all have a &quot;*.pdf&quot; attached (no set naming scheme to these either).
 Each of the emails only goes to a few users so isn&#x27;t being caught via &quot;bulk&quot; sending either. Obviously we&#x27;ve been adding the mail servers into the block lists along with the domains as they come in.
 We&#x27;ve had KnowBe4 running campaigns for years now, so our end users knew what to do (don&#x27;t open anything, report it, etc.). We sent out an email to all users, just informing them of what is happening, and to be vigilant.
 I don&#x27;t think much more can be done to prevent this, other than keep up training for users, keep them informed of threats (as we&#x27;ve done).
 All the mail servers aren&#x27;t within our country and we don&#x27;t do much business outside of this country, so I could restrict all inbound mail just to our country (then just allow through what&#x27;s need when it&#x27;s needed).
 I have got a support case open with our Email Gateway provider, as a few of these emails used the name of end users and should of been caught by &quot;Impersonation Prevention&quot; but it marked them as &quot;Legitimate&quot;.
 Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

 We already have problem dates coming up quick, virgin media will turn off all phone lines supplied by pstn copper in July this year, then in October all EoFTTC and EFM products we get from Zen are disconnected, and then there is the simple stop sales like no standard DSL or FTTC from September. The new products SoGEA does not cover all sites, if you had a line that was DSL only you might be out of luck, and nothing comes with the SLA of EoFTTC or EFM without doubling the cost and going fibre leased line.
 I wonder what people are doing? Personally anything voice we are just shunting to mobile 3G/LTE, the data is going to have to be SoGEA, but we have already identified areas where the service level is reduced or simply no current replacement product meets the same spec.
 It&#x27;s all flipping annoying 😔

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I am in need of some assistance with a project I am working on. I have been tasked with creating an automatic warranty checker for Dell servers, and I am hoping to use Nagios to achieve this. I have found an API for Nagios that was created in 2012, but unfortunately, it is no longer functional. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with creating a Dell server warranty checker using Nagios and would be able to offer any guidance.
 The objective of this project is to create a system that will allow Nagios to self-check the Dell website by service tag and display the warranty status of the server in Nagios, or alternatively, send an email notification. This would help us keep track of the warranty status of our servers and allow us to take action before the warranty expires.
 I would appreciate any help or guidance on this matter, whether it be through pointing me in the direction of helpful resources, providing suggestions on how to tackle this project, or sharing personal experiences with similar projects.
 Thank you in advance for your assistance!

                              <span>Hey All,
 Has anyone successfully decommissioned they’re onprem exchange server? What was your process? We are running hybrid environment but we have no need to keep the onprem (all emails and routing happens on our cloud environment). I’m no exchange wiz - have bearly touched our system except for critical maintenance and mailbox management.
 Thanks!

Dev/UAT/Prod for developed apps that are public facing and a separate environment for Corporate resources - servers, VDI, stuff related to the IT operations for our internal business. 
 We have a devops team that is responsible for the developed apps side by pushing code and building those resources in the cloud. 
 They are actively rebuilding their environment with little to no consultation from the network team and trying to get information from them is like pulling teeth. They come with questions like what IP address range can we use and when we ask questions trying to understand how many they need, they reply with “as many as you can provide for the future because we…</span>

                              <span>I have a bunch of routers at remote sites that I am trying to get a rough idea of their average traffic in bps out of a certain interface based on their counters. I&#x27;m just wondering if my methodology makes sense. Obviously there are better ways to do this but I was not given the lead time to setup monitoring and gather enough data.
 First I take the counter uptime in weeks and days and calculate the total number of seconds.
 TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS &#x3D; (((UPTIME_WEEKS * 7) + UPTIME_DAYS) * 24) * 3600 
 My goal is to get a rough idea of the usage per second. But most of this traffic is during working hours and the uptime above is 24/7. So I divide by 5 since after nights, weekends and holidays I figure the vast majority of traffic is generated in just 20% of the time
 TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS &#x3D; TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS / 5
 Then I calculate the number of bits from the number of bytes in the counters
 TOTAL_BITS &#x3D; TOTAL_BYTES * 8
 Then I calculate the bits per second by dividing by the TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 AVG_bps &#x3D; TOTAL_BITS / TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 Obviously this is a very rough average not taking bursts into account but I&#x27;m also taking some random 5 min average readings will pad the result. Just wondering if I went totally off-the-rails somewhere. 
 Thanks

I have already submitted a new certificate request to our Licensing Team however it will not be available until next Monday. As of result, the anyconnect agents will not be able not trust the portal and wont be able to successfully connect over the weekend. Furthermore, we do not have a PKI in place to use an internal CA to quickly provide a trusted certificate either..Is there any way to train the clients to trust a specific expired cert? Or is there perhaps any other way I can get around this issue until I can get my certificate renewed in a few days? Any advice would be helpful.

                              <span>I hope somebody can help me find an answer. Unfortunately my past network architecture experience is almost a decade out of date and was with Brocade/Fastiron. We did a lot of mesh IP networks matching SAN network meshes, and it was amazing.
 I&#x27;m now in a position and we are considering using Edgecore/Wedge with CumulusLinux for a network rollout. I&#x27;m trying to figure out if its possible to do a PoD type network mesh design, but I&#x27;m coming up short as I search the internet. We haven&#x27;t purchased these so we also have no support contact as of yet.
 What I have is a group of 8x racks with two switches per rack, and I&#x27;m debating what will be the best configuration to avoid or at least reduce having to do the classic multi-layer datacenter aggregation of switches to switches. We also won&#x27;t be controlling the upper networks, it&#x27;ll just be going directly into an ISP from within each group of 8 racks, and I want them cross-connected for faster local networking.
 If anybody knows if this is possible, thanks!
 I know I can create bridges between switches, that&#x27;s fairly normal stuff. It&#x27;s when you get loops even within a mesh that I&#x27;m less certain about.
 [edit]
 To clarify: What I have in mind is a classic star-mesh network from the SAN world, but in the IP world. I don&#x27;t know if this is possible with this gear. It is possible with FastIron, but that might be the extent of it, and nobody else has done this sort of thing. I know Brocade was trying to push it as an open standard but after their demise maybe it just fell away.
 If not, then what is the next-ideal configuration, with 16 switches, and 2x uplinks?

                              <span>I wanted to cross post from the juniper subreddit but it seems I cannot.
 Hi all
 We have an old handmedown mx480 we barely utilize. It has a pair of 16xge cards in it now. We are planning to add another card later this year thanks to some growth.
 I didn’t realize one of those cards was damaged early on and wrecked two of the backplane slots (:() forcefully trying to get the xge card with slightly bent rear pins in. Rookie mistake. It also has only re-s-2000s in it. It seems to be doing fine now with the four full tables it gets but I know I’m pushing my luck, it runs 32 bit junos (and from what I can read, only supports up to what it runs now at 15.1), and we probably will be adding significantly more routes over next few years.
 I’d like to get something that is newer but still used and has potential for another 4-6 years of JunOS support. I’m happy with the mx480 platform and am not angling to change. Especially since if I get a newer chassis I can reuse my existing power supplies and have a spare fan module. Is the mx480- bp3 chassis with scbe2/re-s-1800x4-32g new enough to achieve that goal? Latest JunOS for a while, full tables, relatively newish.
 So far as I can tell, even the current MX isn’t stressed out at all…. I really am just thinking about the next half decade more than the now. Rather make the change now than when more people will be impacted. https://postimg.cc/GBxyfqj2
 EDIT: the big cpu spikes were me switching routing engines so I could reboot them. Four plus years uptime. Some things were acting up like a snmp poll taking 7 minutes. That’s not from normal load.

                              <span>Hi,
 It&#x27;s common knowledge that switches forward broadcast/multicast Ethernet frames out on every port except on the one the frame was received on. This is described e.g. in Computer Networks: A Systems Approach Chapter 3.2.4
 However even though I have fulltext access to IEEE standards, my brain hurts when I try to understand how exactly this behaviour can be deducted from 802.1d, not to speak of 802.1Q. 
 Could someone point me to the relevant portions in the standards where exactly this is derived from?

                              <span>I am searching for a relatively cheap 2m4ghz only wifi router or access point. I don&#x27;t need a lot of speed and not a lot of devices but would like a big coverage with reasonable speed (above 20mbps) for around 50 devices, so I was thinking a high powered 2.4ghz ap would make the most sense,. The other option would be a mesh system, but I would prefer a single ap. 
 Any recommendations?

                              <span>I have an Ansible playbook that can modify the VLAN configuration of Cisco switch ports. Here&#x27;s an example of the host_vars:
 interface:
 GigabitEthernet1/0/1:
 mode: trunk
 GigabitEthernet1/0/2:
 access_vlan: &#x27;100&#x27;
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: &#x27;200&#x27;
 stp_portfast: enable
 GigabitEthernet1/0/3:
 access_vlan: &#x27;100&#x27;
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: &#x27;200&#x27;
 stp_portfast: enable
 ...
 Here&#x27;s the task, which works well and allows me to configure the ports by calling the &#x27;port&#x27; tags:
 - name: assign access port
 cisco.ios.ios_l2_interfaces:
 config:
 - name: &quot;{{item.key}}&quot;
 mode: &quot;{{item.value.mode | default (omit)}}&quot;
 access:
 vlan: &quot;{{item.value.access_vlan | default (omit)}}&quot;
 voice:
 vlan: &quot;{{ item.value.voice_vlan | default (omit) }}&quot;
 state: merged
 with_dict: &quot;{{ interface }}&quot;
 when: (item.value.mode is defined and item.value.mode &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;access&#x27;)
 tags:
 - port
 Let&#x27;s say I want to make changes to G1/0/30. I can make the changes in host_vars, and run the play, however, as you know in Ansible, it will go through each port, validate them, and eventually make changes to G1/0/30. 
 The problem here is that it takes a long time to configure a single port, If I have a stack switch, can&#x27;t even imagine, it will take forever.
 The time it takes to configure a single port using SSH CLI now takes no longer in ansible, which defeats the whole purpose of automation. This will get even trickier during a troubleshooting calls.
 So if anyone who has successfully used Ansible in their network, do you know how to deal with this situation?
 I am looking for a solution where I can invoke the playbook for only the specific interface. without so much change

                              <span>Hi guys, so I have a little chart I&#x27;m creating (for my own reference) that estimates one-way &amp; round-trip latency based on mileage. I&#x27;m aware in long-distance networks, propogation delay is based around the speed of light (1ms of latency per 125km, *when traveling over physical media). However, the figures I&#x27;m observing in real-life are higher than would be suggested by this.
 Example: The RTT between New York and San Francisco should theoretically be around 48ms. However, the actual figures observed are closer to 70ms.
 With this in mind, where is the attentional latency coming from, and is there a good &quot;rule of thumb&quot; multiplier that I can use to estimate latency? I&#x27;m aware that serialization &amp; processing delay is a thing, but given today&#x27;s interface speeds, I can&#x27;t see how that could possibly add up to anything significant. Does the added latency come from the fiber optic medium itself? The fact that light is not traveling in a vacuum? Some sort of operation on the ROADMS?

We are testing some things in mobile to see if it works responsively. It was working fine until yesterday. All of a sudden the site redirects to some shady sites as soon as ii type in the url. It happens only onmobiles ghat too only on my wifi connected devices. Mobile data and laptops seem fine.
 I stopped the site entirely as I was worried and flushed out dns of my browser and changed router dns, password, etc. Still the problem is not resolved.
 Is my website hacked? If it is it must happen to all, other colleagues checked and it works fine there. It works fine on my tablet and laptops and over mobile network.
 Can I do anything to find the root cause?

                              <span>So I wanted to know what everyone&#x27;s thoughts were on these three backup solutions. The company in question has over 20,000 employees and currently uses CommVault which can be very difficult to manage well. A lot of the general work is spent on maintenance and using tickets with CV to get things done. 
 The other part of the question is which solution would work with Salesforce the best. CommVault really lacks in features for SF and isn&#x27;t even on the app exchange. I know cohesity just got a partnership with Ownbackup so that is good and something we are considering. 
 But from everyone&#x27;s experiences what would be the recommendation?

 There&#x27;s lots of blog posts as well as paywalled websites on the subject of IT internships; I was hoping to get feedback from guys and gals in the trenches. I&#x27;ve been sysadminning for decades but have only been at the director level for a short time.
 Looking for feedback on the good and bad of programs others have administered or participated in.

Our security engineer, who art in the server room,
 Hallowed be thy firewall.
 Thy authentication come,
 Thy audits be done,
 In the cloud, as it is on-premise. 
 Give us this day our daily encryption,
 And forgive us our security breaches,
 As we forgive those who breach our PII.
 Lead us not into compliance failures,
 But deliver us from cyber threats. 
 For thine is the network, the power,
 And the glory, of ranch,
 Forever and ever. 
 Access granted.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sorry to say, but our relationship appears to be coming to an end. I promise, it&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s me.
 It&#x27;s me that asked you to support your service, foolishly thinking that you would do something to take care of your customer.
 It&#x27;s me that needed to know when your service was going to have scheduled downtime, and had the nerve to ask for notifications ahead of time. In over 4 years I&#x27;ve never received a notice for a single planned outage - despite asking repeatedly.
 It&#x27;s me that has opened over 100 support tickets with you for various failures in your service in the last 6 months. 
 It&#x27;s me that is tired of being grilled by the execs, wondering when I&#x27;m going to be done giving you 2nd, 3rd, 47th, and 184th chances.
 It&#x27;s me, Bluepeak Communications, that&#x27;s sick of your horseshit telco network, and your abject failure to support your customers. But it&#x27;s you who is going to lose a big customer because you don&#x27;t seem to give a damn when we tell you something&#x27;s wrong.
 Thanks for letting me vent.

It kicks my ADHD into high gear and I can&#x27;t get jack squat done anymore. Any of you in the same boat and have a suggestion on a noise canceling head set? Upper limit on price is around 500 bucks. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>We started getting emails from staff about emails not getting received/delivered and noticed that MS Defender is blocking most valid emails, which are flagged as spam or phishing. 
 We added the domains and email addresses to the safe-sender lists (Policies &amp; rules &gt; Threat policies &gt; Anti-spam policies &gt; Anti-spam inbound policy &gt; Allowed and blocked senders and domains) and also created and safe-sender lists via Exchange Admin &gt; Mail flow &gt; Rules and still valid emails added into the safe-sender list are still getting blocked.
 We enabled notification when emails are quarantined, and staff will have an option to &quot;Review Message,&quot; &quot;Request Release&quot; and &quot;Block Sender.&quot; We will get notified and have two ways of releasing the quarantined emails.
 ​
 Release
  
- This option will have an option to &quot;Submit the message to Microsoft to improve detection (false positive)
 - Allow emails with similar attributes (URL, senders, etc.)
 - then you specify the &quot;Remove allow entry&quot; to 1, 7, 30 days, or a specific date
  
Approve release
  
- selecting this option &quot;will send the message to Microsoft for analysis and evaluation.&quot;
  
It doesn&#x27;t matter which option we select. Even adding to the safe-sender lists, valid emails are getting blocked. Are you experiencing the same issue with MS O365 Defender? Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

 We have a brand new server that has a bizarre hardware problem. We understand, sometimes we get lemons, that&#x27;s what support is for.
 So we&#x27;ve had two engineer visits already and failed to solve the problem, but they did manage to isolate the culprit on the second visit. It needed additional parts which were delivered yesterday. So I asked them to arrange an engineer visit for today. Company policy requires that I get the engineer&#x27;s name and phone number in advance or we can&#x27;t let them onsite; this is provided and I register the engineer.
 This morning, I get an email from them asking if the engineer visit can go ahead. I respond in the affirmative.
 Tumbleweed.
 No response, no ETA, nothing. Okay, there were for the previous two vis…</span>

 Hoping someone has a solid suggestion for a 10GB SFP switch I can use for backend traffic between our production ESXi servers (Q#2) and PAC (SAN storage. The Cisco unit that was quoted to us came in way too expensive ( Cisco Catalyst 9300X ) so hoping to hear other suggestions we can look into. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I need your opinion. I come from a federal background where we had to have MFA on everything, and it didn&#x27;t matter if we were on the internal network or accessing the network remotely. However at my new organization (which handles mostly banking clients) it seems the overall trend is no MFA for internal access to the domain, but only if the user is working remotely. Is this common? Is this best practice? I feel like MFA should be configured for external and internal but maybe I&#x27;m biased? What do you think?

                              <span>Update: I talked to the COO and it went well. “No action today” was the determination. I got a better idea of the scope, and I laid out the risks. We need further discussion to talk about kinds of access, and we discussed reasons for limiting how many people can make changes to SharePoint sites. 
 Overall, the in-person discussion went well, and I feel like this is back under control. 
 I appreciate everyone who had a thoughtful comment and offered good suggestions
 Original Post:
 This request came in yesterday. I told them we can&#x27;t do that, but I&#x27;m still getting pressure. I&#x27;ve asked them what they&#x27;re trying to do and exactly what kind of access they want, but that giving the HR director access to folders that could contain customer PII is a non-starter. The COO just changed the request to all Operations sites, which seems OK for the COO, but still not HR. 
 I&#x27;ve cited potential fine, lawsuits, and failing third-party investor due-diligence IT audits. 
 I have an informal meeting with them today and will hopefully get some insight into their goals, but as of now I have no idea why they want HR to have this access.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>To the sysadmins that have warehouses they also have to manage:
 How do you handle accounts in your warehouses with people that are very very computer illiterate? I just went through our AD and we have about... 37 shared accounts.
 I am lost on how to transition these users to using their own logins due to how many people can use a single station - I&#x27;m most stuck on users not knowing how to switch accounts using the &#x27;other accounts&#x27; option on the Windows logon screen.
 I&#x27;ve been at this new place for about 3 months, and while I am working on transitioning to running the department myself (currently just me and my boss who&#x27;s transitioning to another field), my main goal during this first year is to clean things up and implement best practices. 
 Part of me wants to ask if there&#x27;s ever any situation where shared accounts are okay, but at the end of the day there&#x27;s 0 accountability if something happens on one of these computers.
 How do you guys handle these? KIOSK mode? Print out instructions at workstations on switching accounts?

 ​
 I really struggle with knowing what I&#x27;m supposed to be currently working on and like what tasks take priority versus other non-critical tasks. 
 ​
 Is this just bad management? I would like to find another job but I&#x27;m waiting until I buy a house before making the move - how do you manage a job like this?

However, I am doing some testing with new VMs today, and it still seems to be registering the VMs and setting up device etc, on brand new VMS, not being registered to autopilot. What is the azure ad/mdm management registration behavior supposed to be for a windows device setup fro oobe, which is not pre-registered to autopilot, but has selected &quot;set up for an organization&quot;, and signed in with the managed/licensed intune user?

                              <span>I was hired on as the IT Manager for a company that own several apartment building spread out across the eastern US. One of the first things I noticed was that some of our locations had a firewall, while some of them did not. I got a firewall installed and site to site VPN set up at all our locations. Recently I became aware that some of our sites have a wireless network for tenants to use though the site&#x27;s ISP. My first reaction is to remove all ISP wireless and setup a managed wireless infrastructure at each location.
 Am I overacting by adding firewalls with site to site VPN at all our locations and wanting to have all wireless networks at our locations be managed and using the same equipment that we use on our corporate wireless? Any idea of why they would not use firewalls at all locations? How would you handle the tenant wireless infrastructure?
 I am a team of 1 at my company and the person I took over for was not a technical person.

 I was wondering if anyone knows how to clear cookies from specific sites every time the user logs in to the computer. 
 I was thinking about uploading a powershell script to Endpoint, if i&#x27;m not mistaken i dont think its possible doing this with Powershell. 
 Does anyone else have any idea that maybe worked for them?

 I have experience with vSphere 7.0.3 at my current job. Only menial tasks like Creating/Updating VMs, Snapshots, Windows Update test Templates. I’d like to level up and get a certification. I have access to Stormwind Studios training. But would VMware’s ‘Customer Connect Learning Premium Subscription’ be better? 
 Will I need a hands-on test environment? I’m willing to invest money if needed for training. I know I can’t test around on our production servers.

                              <span>Good day all. Hopefully someone here can help me out.
 We are having an issue where someone from, for example, &#x27;john@superawesomeclient.com&#x27; sends an email to a distribution list, for example &#x27;groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za&#x27; which I and a few others on &#x27;myowndomain.com&#x27; (hosted on microsoft 365) are a member of, we wont get that message but john@superawesomeclient.com will get a NDR it will have this
  
Error DetailsError:550 5.7.360 Remote server returned message denied by administrative policy -&gt; 550 Administrative prohibition - envelope blocked - https://community.mimecast.com/docs/DOC-1369#550 [ZgnzmELwMCC9bjqMvfWALQ.za9]Message rejected by:za-smtp-1.mimecast.co.za
  
Now other people on &#x27;superawesomeclient.com&#x27; and &#x27;fantasticclient.co.za&#x27; domains can send emails to me and others in my domain I get them no problem, but its is emails from &#x27;groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za&#x27; is where my issue lays.
 Both the mentioned domains are on my &#x27;allowed list&#x27;, and I have both of those domains setup to bypass the built-in spam filters. I have even set the all the Mimecast server ip&#x27;s (for South Africa that is) in my &#x27;IP Allow list&#x27; from on our &#x27;Connection filter Policy&#x27;, but still emails from just the one account (groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za) by anyone on my domain (myowndomain.com).
 ​
 How can I go about resolving this and what would I need to show the people at &#x27;fantasticclient.co.za&#x27; and their domain is &#x27;whitelisted&#x27; so to speak if this is their issue?

                              <span>Yes I know about Papercut and PrintLogic but this is strictly asking how to do it via GPP.
 I have 200+ printers, 1000+ users, different locations with some locations having multiple different departments.
 Questions: How big of an impact is printer mapping via GPP to user log on times? Should all the printers be mapped in 1 GPO or different GPOs? How do you get around the UAC prompt when regular users attempt to add printers?

When they send us emails, for whatever reason their emails come in as an attachment. We basically are getting an email from the sender, but there is no body in the email. The entire email is put into an outlook attachment (.msg file).
 I am not sure how to even properly search for this condition. Any thoughts on this? Anyone else seen this behavior before?

                              <span>If you plan to move towards passwordless via smart cards, passwords are still required for initial onboarding plus the users may need to access certain things via their AD credentials that don’t support smart card authentication.
 It would not be practical for the users to have to call the help desk every time they need to access something via password and, if they have a known password always available to them, it defeats some of the security of using a smart card since the smart card authentication can be bypassed if the password is compromised.
 What are you doing to give SCRIL users password access for onboarding and to authenticate to resources that don’t recognize smart cards?

                              <span>If you already have a PKI in place for other purposes anyway, is there a reason to still prefer WHfB Cloud Trust instead of Key Trust?
 It appears that the main advantage of Cloud Trust is that it allows you to deploy while avoiding requiring having a PKI in your environment. If your environment stills needs a PKI for other reasons, that advantage goes away.
 Doesn’t key trust have better RDP compatibility and also allows you to use “run as” where you cannot with cloud trust?

                              <span>We have more than 10 office users using chrome on a daily basis.
 Two days ago some of them notified me that the print preview takes literally ages to load. I stayed after work to check and it not only takes more than two minutes to load but it also crashes chrome 1/3 times.
 I scraped the internet for a solution and tried a bunch of stuff and ended up fixing it by manually installing new Post script drivers on all 10 machines for all 3 office printers.
 The preview now works without crashing Chrome but it still takes about 5 seconds to load (a big improvement over the 2 minutes it used to take). Naturally everyone is still complaining because according to them it used to be instantaneous before.
 Im all out of ideas here so any tips would be really appreciated. One option is obviously to just use another browser but it’s an unpopular option as “they’re all really used to chrome and how it looks”
 Pls help.

 Just looking for suggestions here, and yes I am aware that allowed automatic picture downloads is not a good idea, but it is not up to me. I&#x27;m being told to enable it whether I like it or not.

                              <span>So I have been running my Dell Precision 5820 workstation for a few days now. It has a Intel Xeon W-2133 CPU (6/12 3.60Ghz base clock). I am running Windows 11 22H2 fully patched and am using SSDs and have 32GB of RAM. 
 And I have been noticing when I push the system to do heavy tasks that the CPU performance at 90% CPU load across all threads hovers around 3.45Ghz, I never see it hit 3.60Ghz or its boost of 3.90Ghz. 
 The bios settings are set to default, Speedstep and TurboBoost are enabled and the bios is on the latest version. 
 I wonder if its a Dell thing or a Microsoft Windows 11 thing? 
 Thanks,

                              <span>For every business or company reaching out the actual customers or users is very challenging especially for Saas products. Here are some best practices to gain real users. 
  
By utilizing social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to connect with potential customers, share your product updates and content. You can also join relevant groups and participate in conversations to build relationships.
 Creating quality content such as blog posts, case studies, ebooks, that provide value to your target audience can help attract and engage potential customers. By sharing your content on social media and other channels, you can drive traffic to your website and generate leads.
 By optimizing your website and content for search engines, you can increase the visibility of your website in search results and attract potential customers who are looking for the solutions you provide.
 Writing guest posts for relevant blogs, publications, and online communities can help increase your exposure and drive traffic to your website. Be sure to provide valuable insights and offer solutions that are related to your product.
 Encourage your existing customers to refer your product to others who might benefit from it. You can offer incentives such as discounts or free trials to encourage referrals.
 Engage with your potential customers on forums, Reddit and other online communities where they gather to discuss industry topics. By contributing value and building trust with members, you can raise awareness of your product and build a loyal following.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 Looking to see what you folks use for RFX management? i.e. we are issuing an RFP so we don&#x27;t really need help creating the RFP itself (but that would be nice!) but we do need a portal where vendors could leave their responses and questions related to the RFP could be answered. Ideally we want to host this ourselves.
 ​
 I was thinking we could use NextCloud but wondering if there were better options? X-posted to selfhosted.
 ​
 Thanks!

 As far as I can tell it should be fine but obviously can&#x27;t test.

 What are you using to get notifications regarding newly discovered security risks/vulnerabilities?

 I try to compare two arrays, but I dont get it. Why this is not working? I runs through, but doesnt add the values to the arrays. 
 The $AdGroupNames is an array. The $AdGroupName is an PSCustomObject, maybe thats the problem? How to solve this?
 $AdGroupNames &#x3D; Get-ADGroup -Filter * -SearchBase &quot;ou&#x3D;......&quot; | Select-Object Name
 ​
 #compare existing distribution groups with required DGs.
 $ExistingDGs &#x3D; @(Get-DistributionGroup | Select-Object Name)
 ​
 #DGs which will stay
 $DGstay &#x3D; @()
 #DGs which will be deleted
 $DGdelete &#x3D; @()
 #new DGs
 $DGnew &#x3D; @()
 ​
 foreach ($AdGroupName in $AdGroupNames){
 if ($AdGroupName -in $ExistingDGs){$DGstay +&#x3D; $AdGroupName}
 else{$DGnew +&#x3D; $AdGroupName}
 }
 ​
 foreach ($ExistingDG in $ExistingDGs){
 if ($ExistingDG -in $AdGroupNames){$DGdelete +&#x3D; $ExistingDG}
 }
 ​

 I see I can make myself powershell script and scheduled task, but all I want is having daily snapshots for the last 5 days.
 &gt;inb4 do b backups
 They are done both of important data inside and of the entire VMs with veeam.
 But I just want daily snapshots to have bit of extra automated &quot;backup&quot; when I am updating stuff inside, knowing I can do so without extra step of doing snapshot beforehand. Which is easier and faster to revert to than backups.

                              <span>Hello fellow troubleshooters,
 im a bit stuck and could need some input from you:
 We have a Windows Server 2016 RDS. Since last Week users complaining that they cant open some PDF Files. I got the ticket now from my colleague to help him.
 I analyzed the problem and found that all files that wont work have the DataStream ZoneIdentifier tag set that they are from the internet and could harm the system. If i rightclick the file it show the info box &quot;this file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer&quot;.
 So far so good. If i click on allow and therefore remove the Zone Identifier the File opens with a double click. 
 I checked other file types aswell. The same Problem with word files, and image files. So its not a application problem. It seems to be a windows problem.
 If i change the internetoptions-&gt; security -&gt; Internet Zone -&gt; Start unsecure applications and files : from confirm (recommended) -&gt; to activate (not secure) the problem is gone also. But i dont like to change this setting.
 What could cause this problem? Can you help me?

                              <span>With the 2012R deadline approaching I upgraded everything to 2022, and rebuilt out DC&#x27;s in the process. I was ready to decommission the final 2012R2 DC but when testing via a shutdown, I experienced an outage. 
 Our intranet, hosted on Google Cloud on Ubuntu, requires a sign in with an active directory credential to access (email address + password via LDAP). Despite changing the IP of the VM&#x27;s DNS server to match our new DC&#x27;s (one on GCP and one on prem), the moment I turn off the old DC is the moment authentication on this server fails, and staff instead get an &quot;Internal Server Error&quot; page from apache. 
 Digging into the apache config, I can see the authentication is using LDAP, with the following section;
 ## Active Directory AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthLdapBindDN readonly@int.domain.net AuthLdapBindPassword AuthLdapBindURL ldap://int.domain.net:3268/?userPrincipleName?sub 
 Three things about this;
 1 - Even though the AD account it&#x27;s using to authenticate has the absolute minimum access, I don&#x27;t like how the password is stored in plain text. Is this a requirement for such a setup?
 2 - What configures that ldap:// and how do I get it to point to the new DC&#x27;s? Is this configured vía our public DNS instead? Or is not DNS at all?? 
 3 - Doing some digging online I discovered that it&#x27;s possible to &quot;automatically authenticate&quot; via their user account if the credentials match (meaning they don&#x27;t have to enter them in). Is this only possible on Windows/will it break a manual username/password entry? We have some Macs around.

                              <span>After some recent less than desirable experiences at my job, I reached out to a recruiter. They have passed along a job opportunity to be the IT Manager at a Non Profit for me to look at. I would be the sole IT person onsite and the description lists everything from on boarding new employees for training to writing and implementing policy. Apparently there is a significant level of vendors leveraged right now, but it still seems as though the job might be punching a bit above it&#x27;s weight class in terms of expectations and salary. The network size is approximately 100 end user devices according to the recruiter (computers). 
 What are people&#x27;s experiences working in an environment like this? Is there a chance it could be good? Or will it be an extremely overworked shit show? 
 I will also add I have previously been a network admin and systems engineer and feel as though my only weak point skillset wise will be the HIPPA stuff. I do have experience working in a heavily controlled and audited environment so I think it will be more so based around learning the new intricacies VS entirely new concepts. In the listing they specifically call out that they will send people to training to ensure their skillset stays sharp. 
 The salary is more than livable (85k) as it will be a great resume builder and it&#x27;s similiar to my current role as an engineer. I wouldn&#x27;t be taking a pay cut.

 We have attempted to buy them from amazon/ebay, but they never work. Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t have the skillset to figure this issue out.

                              <span>Looking for some prior experience and advice anyone has on cambium network switches. They are being considered for our large church network. We are looking to save some money so we were recommended these but very concerned since our current switches are all HP/Aruba and we absolutely love those but they are all like 15+ years old.

                              <span>Hey there fellow networkers! I am running into a particular issue that I am researching a better solution. I am primarily a PON engineer so I am used to working in that space but as my ISP that I work for is transitioning away from Active E setups, besides for enterprise customers, and moving more to XGS-PON for connections, I am running into an issue with MDUs, mainly apartment complexes. 
 ​
 We install a 48 port L2 switch then through the CLI, apply traffic shapers accordingly to what the customer is paying for on that interface instead of installing a managed router or some kind of CPE equipment. This is great and all being fed from a Active E connection or even now a XGS ONT since the apartment complex doesn&#x27;t want to run fiber to all the units and want to re-utilize all the copper connections so we install a managed switch. So far this works for a dedicated NOC tech to turn up or down or apply different traffic shapers to the interface but that generates a lot of tickets for work that I don&#x27;t want them doing all day long but I can&#x27;t necessarily teach the customer service or billing people to do those tasks. 
 ​
 Now we do run UNMS/UISP because we use it for managing GPON ONUs via UOLT, ERX, Air Cubes and other Ubiquiti products but I keep seeing stuff about the UISP Switch Pro being able to apply Traffic Shaper profiles and turn up/down interfaces with ease. Before I order one for testing, is it just as easy with the new CRM system to create a customer, apply a service plan and assign a port interface just in a similar fashion as the GPON ONUs? If so, that would alleviate a lot of manual work!

                              <span>So at my work we have many devices that connect over a 485 wire, the system is close to EoL and we want an easyish way to upgrade our customers without having to pull cat6 for the new system. the main question is would MoCa adapters be a good fit to convert the 2 wire to ethernet (obviously using a bnc or coax adapter)
 -Would like to be able to have a one &quot;head end&quot; device that could go into the facility network and then multiple endpoint devices for the different devices on the current 485 loop
 If this is possible with MoCa, what would be a good recommendation? Any Ideas would be appreciated

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting weary of providing these explanations over and over again. (TCP vs UDP, multiple streams, multiple concurrent tests, testing the network element vs testing the hosts at either end, etc.)
 Surely someone has produced a solid write up or video at some point right? Like that traceroute interpretation video that made the rounds a while back?

                              <span>So I’m in an odd situation here. I’ve spent the last 15 years of my life buried in the CLI to become the best network engineer I could. I got my BS degree (bullshit degree I call it), I got my CCNA r/S, CCNA Voice, CCNP r/S, and I’m working to renew it into an CCNP Enterprise…. But I’m burnt out. 
 I work so much that it’s crumbled my personal/family life. I’ve also grown into an alcoholic over the years. I’ve worked the 12 step program but with the stress of my job – I keep going back to the boos. It’s time to make a change. 
 So I’ve been putting out apps for jobs that I’m essentially overqualified for – main reason is so I can go to work and not have to stress. I can set up a VLAN instead of design a whole VXLAN from scratch. I can make sure the link lights are up – instead of delve into the CLI for 3 hours trying to troubleshoot things down to the packet level… At least – this is my plan. 
 I have a final interview for a NOC 3 position. The pay is surprisingly good for a NOC job and based off what I learned in my second interview – this job should be a breeze. 
 So my strange question is – has anyone taken a step BACK from the hard charge “study everyday” mentality? If so – did it help your personal life? What’s it like working in the NOC from the perspective of a more senior guy? I ask because most NOC techs I’ve worked with were early career (justifiably so). I’ve never worked in a NOC but everywhere I’ve worked has had one – so I’m familiar with most duties. 
 I’m doing this to save my marriage, personal life, and get my shit back together – and I’m blessed in that the paycut is not all that bad since I’ll be a t3… No they haven’t given me an offer but I told them my bottom line number and they still called me back 1 hour later to do the final interview.

                              <span>Hello,for home i need to cover big area, I care for range, no matter what speed and how many devices can be supported, I want to cover big area. For this reason, is mesh system better than access point?

                              <span>We&#x27;re investigating using EVPN-BGP in our data center (100-200 servers, thousands of VMs in Openstack). Although I personally have been in the networking industry for awhile as a software engineer, I am going to need to heavily ramp up on BGP in general and try to learn these technologies from the ground up.
 Wondering with those that have some experience here whether setting these scenarios up in Eve-NG is possible/effective or whether just jumping into setting up the physical hardware is a better option.
 Appreciate any guidance here.

                              <span>I need some help commenting, analyzing, and criticizing different queuing models for some IoT interactions.
 ​
 Using the simulator MobileJINQS with support of the ON/OFF model, assuming that each ON/OFF model represented a mobile sender that uses various QoS settings for the transmission of messages and followed 4 experiments:
 ​
  
ON/OFF Model
  
* The server remains in the ON and OFF states for exponentially distributed time periods T_ON &#x3D; T_OFF &#x3D; 20 / 40 / 60s;
 * Messages get processed with a mean service demand D&#x3D;0.125s
 * Messages arrive to the queue with a mean rate lambda varying from 0.05 to 4 messages/sec.
 This is the simulated curve of the mean response time for several lambda rates:
 ​

 ​
  
ON/OFF Model with QoS Features
  
* T_ON&#x3D;T_OFF&#x3D;20s
 * Mean service demand D&#x3D;0.125s
 * Message arrival rate lambda varies from 0.05 to 3.9 messages/sec.
 ​
 On that basis, we had four experiments on, considering these QoS features:
 (1) Tau &#x3D; 1, lifetime &#x3D; infinity, and K &#x3D; infinity
 (2) Tau &#x3D; 1, lifetime &#x3D; 30s, and K &#x3D; infinity
 (3) Tau &#x3D; 0.75, lifetime &#x3D; infinity, and K &#x3D; infinity
 (4) Tau &#x3D; 1, lifetime &#x3D; infinity, and K &#x3D; 100
 ​
 For each of the four experiments, the ON/OFF model was run 10 times and we got the following curve, response time with respect to arrival rate lambda:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/lo3SaXP.png
 ​
 As well as sucess rate with respect to arrival rate:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/qF35p07.png
 ​
  
Nonpreemptive priority and multiclass simulation model
  
​
 K classes were defined with different arrival lambda_k and service rates mu_k for each class.
 ​
 Depending on the values of lambda_k and mu_k, the system can be saturated.
 ​
 Let p be the server utilization. The queue remains unsaturated when p &lt; 1.
 ​
 We got the curvers of different server utilization, first one was p&#x3D;0.69 and classes C&#x3D;19; and second was p&#x3D;0.89 and classes C&#x3D;9

 It would be much appreciated!

                              <span>The company I&#x27;m working for wants me to do research on quantum networking, I am having an extremely hard time finding any information on the subject. What I have found so far is that it&#x27;s supposed to &quot;keep people from easdropping on your network&quot; I&#x27;m assuming it means man in the middle attacks. 
 Can anyone give me further information/configurations or a place where I can find more information than the idea of it?

                              <span>Using dhcp-local-server on Juniper EX3400 running 20.2R3. On boot, Windows machine 802.1x auths with a computer account (host\PCNAME.example.com) and gets a DHCP lease without problem.
 User logs in, 802.1x auth occurs with user’s account (EXAMPLE\jdoe) and EX3400 dhcp process deletes the existing DHCP binding, resulting in Windows machine getting a new IP address.
 Desired behavior is no IP change.
 This only occurs when the machine is directly connected to the switch running dhcp-local-server. When machine is connected to an EX3400 switch trunked to the switch providing DHCP, this does not occur, as the DHCP process has no awareness of the auth change.
 Any ideas of how to get dhcp-local-server to ignore 802.1x auth events?
