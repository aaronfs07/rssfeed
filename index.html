                              <span>What would the recommendation be between Linux+ and LPIC-1 ? Based in the UK
 Also, any recommended study materials for a particular one?
 I would consider Red Hat too, but is literally too expensive and out of the equation.
 Plus, I would like to gain a good understanding of Linux system, not deep dive into it and be an expert at it.

 I have tried other devices and other browsers with the same issue. And it&#x27;s just my website. So this isn&#x27;t a internet or chrome or web browser issue I don&#x27;t think.
 I&#x27;m guessing something went wrong with my website. Maybe I got hacked? I got a really weird email saying &quot;42 - ( ) &quot; that said it was sent from myself via my website, around the time my website went down.
 How can I fix this when I can&#x27;t even access the control panel of my website? (since I need to go to my website to access the Wordpress dashboard)

                              <span>I just started working it for this company 3 weeks ago and we’ve got some problems way over my head. The boss man new this going in but I’m in school and he’s helping me OJT this stuff. 
 Our current conundrum is twofold. I need to build a server that can house a MySQL server VM database that any one or two or three of 10 people can access at any given time, as well as run a file sharing VM to access a few network mapped drives. I’ve been looking servers with 2x xenon e5-2699 v3s, would that be enough processing power? 128gb ram and probably 8x 1tb SSDs. 
 More importantly at the moment, we just tried switching ISPs for gigabit speeds and learned the hard way that comcast blocks port 445 and will not unblock it no matter what. And we use 445 for our current Azure file shares SMB network mapped drives. Is there a good work around for the mean time while I get this new server built? Our MSP wants $4k to build an Azure VPN to tunnel the file shares but that’s a little absurd. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all, Im trying to use the Remote desktop software to login into a second user account Ive created on my home pc. 
 Basically, I just want another instance of windows to multi-box something, but other software as VMware and Virtualbox dont work. I know other people that use RDP for the reason I want to use it for too, so thats why Im deciding to use it, however none of them ran into the problem im having.
 Ive created 2 seperate Admin accounts on my PC, one with just a Name / pw, and the other with my microsoft email.
 I am using &quot;127.0.0.2&quot; to try and log into the either of the second users, and using the microsoft account one does not work for some reason, it says credentials are wrong. However I can use the other user that i named &quot;Test&quot; with a password i set.
 However upon loggin into that account, I am greeted by the error stated in the title. I have googled the issue and there are a ton of people also having similar problem, will some suggestions saying to add registry keys, or change some setttings in windows to change the limit of connections. I have done all of these but they have not worked.

 I&#x27;ve been struggling with this issue for a few hours and after hours of searching for solution I decided to ask for help here (I very rarely go ask to a forum). It appears that uwsgi cannot bind to /run/uwsgi due to it being a read-only filesystem. When I try to set the location elsewhere it results in the same thing. Does anyone know what to do with this?

 I read that many hate rhel, other hate Ubuntu and Canonical, other that hate what happened to centos..and many other. Many of this probably came from casual users or not techical user. 
 What think sysadmin about this 2 distros?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Title says it all. Our leadership is considering pulling the plug on MECM and moving us to BigFix. 
 Any insider tips? Opinions? Technically they seem comparable. Going through the demo process now. Anything to watch out for?
 We mainly use MECM currently to issue patching, WinOS upgrades, and app deployments; our Macs currently on JAMF, and our Linux are unmanaged. 
 Our scope on BF would be all our 15,000 servers/workstations/laptops covering all OS types Win/MacOS/Linux. At this time MDM would not be included and our Android/iOS will be staying on MobileIron core at this time.

 Junior support engineer here.
 Part of my goals for the year are writing end user instructions for the business.
 This can range from devs to your usual corporate roles (HR, fiance etc) 
 Do you have any suggestions on what I should write about apart from the obvious.
 Any and all suggestions welcome.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am posting this question to the community as I am looking for some suggestions, helpful guides which can help me implementing the design to achieve the below scenario:
 Scenario: We have to automate the application onboarding for OIDC/SAML app. hosted in secure auth to ForgeRock.
 Design: Similar to any IAC tool where we declare the desired state using a yaml file, the same conecpt is said to be utilized. We would have a yaml file defining application details. Going through terraform registry, I found that there is no such provider defined for oidc/saml app onboarding by ForgeRock. Also, if we define a plugin for same we are restricted by the programming language (need to use Go for development). So, we need a kind of python script which can function similar to a provider in Terraform, reading through the desired application configuration from the yaml file and then making use of the rest api endpoint exposed by ForgeRock for creating the app.
 Can anyone in the community please help me out here with any useful resources like any Github repo&#x27;s ,opensource project, docs which I can make use of to give me a starting point about how this can be implemented?

                              <span>Hi everybody, 
 Last week my company decided they want to set up three TVs in the production facility which only purpose will be to show on all screens the same web page. This TVs have Android and Chromecast built-in and will be connected over Wifi. I have already set up an hidden SSID with a separate VLAN with only guest access (they can&#x27;t reach any service or server aside from the ones I decide to). I have also set up a Windows 10 VM to try casting via Google Chrome and it works fine. The issue is that this setup takes a lot of resources from the VM and sometimes the image on the TVs gets &quot;blurry&quot; when it&#x27;s still for a few mins. The question is: is there a better way to do what I&#x27;m doing? I can&#x27;t find any viable desktop software that lets me cast to multiple devices. 
 Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t use any additional wiring because the distances will be too high. The only thing we could improve would be to connect the TVs via Ethernet. 
 Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions!

 Any ideas??? (btw, the ports that do work have entire internet connectivity and it&#x27;s 1ghps and working fine, so I don&#x27;t see how it could be a nat issue.)

 I was wondering if you could recommend any applications that have free editions or trials? It would be great to test them out and see how they work in practice. Thanks in advance for your help!

 Would some authenticator apps have logs on their phone to look at? 
 For example:
 Microsoft authenticator just left a notification to on the phone to “approve sign in” and 1 hour later when user clicked the notice it just glitches out with a time out error message
 So no way to know which account triggered it?
 What steps would you do if it happened? And what are some logical possibility, (ie, the mail app on iPhone trying to login with cached credentials.) to tell the user so they don’t like freak out.

 Some months ago I started paying an extra to my ISP in order to have a static IP, which I think it entails not being behind a Carrier-grade NAT.
 I see that my router is choosing 100.64.0.83 and 100.64.0.84 as DNS servers. Under my understanding, DNS servers are &quot;external/public machines&quot;, for instance 8.8.8.8 belongs to Google. But looking up 100.64.0.83, it seems like it&#x27;s a &quot;shared address space&quot;, which seems to be like the 192.168.0.xx, part of a private network. But I don&#x27;t t hink it&#x27;s not part of my private network (the ping is higher). Am I actually behind a CGN or am I misunderstanding something?

                              <span>I will have the following:
  
1 Windows Server 2019 PC where GPMC is controlled [DC] (192.168.4.10)
 1 Windows 11 PC to access the PC above to modify GPMC (192.168.4.99)
 10 PC Clients (192.168.4.150 [-159])
 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
 Default Gateway: 192.168.4.2
 Primary DNS: 192.168.4.10
  
The idea is for the clients to access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 station, as I plan on doing some sort of filtering. That is, if a client attempts to access a blocked site, they will see a site unavailable page that I will re-direct them to.
 I was thinking to have them access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 PC, but I&#x27;ve also been told that I should set up another server strictly for RRAS, which I&#x27;m very new to, as well.
 I also want to install software from GPMC. For that, I will need a shared folder somewhere on my network that my clients can access, without allowing access to my network settings or GPMC.
 My question: Please show me a network drawing of how I should go about this setup. There will be two users in my active directory: MyAdmin and MyUser. All 10 clients will connect using MyUser. The PC used to access GPMC will use MyAdmin.
 What (if any) PCs should I add to this network and what function would they serve? If I add more PCs, who handles acting like a router? File Server (for installations)? As I&#x27;m trying to do that all on the DC but I hear that&#x27;s not good practice.

 The local buildings are mostly like warehouses where production work is being done with some office spaces for desk type workers. 
 A main building where main data etc feed drops and a main server exists. (nothing like a noc etc you may commonly find in a standard office building) 
 Most equipment and their operating systems are overdue for an upgrade (have already reached end of support/life or just about to)

 I’ve posted a while to find something for reporting etc and I think I’ve landed on NTOP as they seem to have solved the VPN issue I would be bound to experience with Zabbix.
 Scenario: We have a few installations with jump boxes installed for our audio visual installations that we managed across Australia.
 Wanting to find something simple that wasn’t subscription based that I could host at the office to get all that data back.
 I haven’t done a demo yet but wondering if anything had any NTOP experience and if so, anything missing, anything you don’t like?

                              <span>We&#x27;re serving an L2TP VPN for our users. Some experience timeouts of some requests to an internal webserver. This scenario is
  
user is on a home internet connection
 
vpn is established
 
packets to the webserver are routed through the vpn
 
dns resolution through vpn works
 
login page of the webserver may load or timeout depending on luck
 
using another internet connection solves the issue
 
 I&#x27;m guessing there is something special about l2tp I don&#x27;t understand, that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m posting here. It looks like the some home routers are messing with some encrypted packets. How? I haven&#x27;t seen behaviour like this ever before.

 I have a technical interview for a Sr. Linux Systems Administrators on Wednesday. I’ve heard that other failed candidates have been too ‘junior’.
 What in particular would you expect to come up on a Sr. Linux Admin technical interview?
 I think I’m at a senior level, but this has me nervous 😋
 Things I’m comfortable with:
  
Storage - Local and SAN. Various file systems. LVM. Monitoring disk space and disk performance/health 
 Upgrading systems and rolling back packages/kernels 
 Backups with various tools such as Veeam
 Compiling software with GCC/Make
 GIT
 NFS/Samba
 Monitoring tools such as Nagios/SolarWinds
 Networking/load balancing/firewalls/bonding 
 Active Directory/LDAP
 Bash/Python scripting 
 Ansible/Terraform
 Printing/cups
  
What am I missing that a senior should know how to do? 🙂
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙂

The issue I&#x27;m faced with is that for some strange reason, I cannot hear any sound from within the VDI environment through my regular sound output; they only way I can listen to sound within the VDI is if I switch my sound to my monitor&#x27;s native speakers or plug in my headphones.
 I&#x27;ve searched all over the web for a solution and pretty much get the same note about installing a driver update, but after checking I have the latest.
 I&#x27;m running Windows 10 x64.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Running Windows system check.
 Running Windows sound check/fix
 Disabling the native speaker option/driver
 Rebooting the computer.
 Checking to make sure I have the lastest updates.
 Cursing at my tower.
 Going outside to get a burger then coming home and trying steps 1-6
  
Nothing seems to change; advice would be apreciated.

No matter what I do if any drive other than the ssd is connected when the machine is booted - booting from the ssd won’t even be an available option for me. Automatically off the list. I will always end up in the EFI shell. 
 So at this point I’m only connecting the SSD and booting to windows server 2022 and running random-ish firmware and driver updates from the intel site. Their site/tool is recognizing the individual hardware but throwing some error about some thing like my hardware configuration - idk I’m away from the house right now but I imagine it’s because of my Frankenstein setup so it’s not able to recommend drivers and updates for me I’m kinda guessing and checking. 
 I’m not sure my professor is even supposed to be used with this board the, Xeon 1650 V4 @ 3.6 GHz; but they were being used together in a product I got this from. 
 I have 128 GB RAM and a second processor on the way just cause. The setup should theoretically work as it is though they were running Linux. 
 I wanted to get started with something I was familiar with (windows) but I suppose I can try a Linux distro in parallel if there are suggestions. Would really love to solve this tho for windows. Want a GUI on either.
 Thanks !

                              <span>Mine is VirtualBox. I&#x27;m currently using it for my IT classes and it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. I especially like how easy it is to set up a shared folder between the host and guest. 
 I&#x27;ve dabbled in Hyper-V a bit and there is definitely a learning learning curve. At least for me. 
 I have not touched VMware.

                              <span>Title says it all. We actually will retain a low-end firewall for some basic security and to manage redundant ISP uplinks. 
 We went serverless. It wasn&#x27;t even planned. Between going O365 and several other business critical apps migrating SaaS, when we looked to renew our on-prem server stack, it was real easy to just eliminate or migrate the remaining to PaaS/SaaS. 
 Part of that was moving to Azure AD and Intune/Defender, and then the more we looked at it, and with half our work force remote anyway, we felt we no longer needed on prem network security or a firewall. Just need internet. I feel we are more secure than before and it&#x27;s easier to manage and keep up with.
 Costs and workloads are relative yet shifted. I don&#x27;t even know if I am quite a sysadmin anymore. I have always had multiple roles, but not really a network admin for sure. But I keep busy. It has been stressful here in the middle of my career doing a complete upgrade in knowledge, and it was a crapton of work.

                              <span>Very soon, I will be meeting with HR and my director to present the subjects we should be covering under our Cyber policies.
 This includes things like:
  
 Email
  Internet Usage
  File Sharing
  USB access
  
However, I feel kind of lost, and unsure of how i’m supposed to cover EVERY topic, to not leave out anything etc. 
 I’m also unsure of the wording, does HR take care of that, and IT simply presents the subjects, and what we need legally covered?
 I have low expectations for someone writing the policy for us, and fully expect to be charged with doing this task.
 How did you come up with your operating policies?

 Anyone have any vendor recommendations ? So far we’ve looked at Drata, Vanta and Trustcloud (the later I wasn’t impressed with, first call could of been answered with an email, a second meeting for a demo and a required 3rd meeting to even get pricing is where I told them no thanks)
 Also who do you recommend for pen testing? We are a SaaS company that provides a LMS , and building a new Version of our product to be built around Soc out of the gate

                              <span>I am upgrading our ERP system this weekend. Rather, I should say I am coordinating between 3 different vendors upgrading our ERP system. In our non-production systems, the best timing I could get for the activity was about 15 hours. Then 2 hours for checkout. So I have been advertising a 18 hour outage to give me some slush time. Coming in a couple hours early would make everyone happy, and running over would be painful, so having a little extra fluff was great (AKA The Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott Engineering Rule).
 Cut to today. Had everything in place, management was frothing to get this going. They were all on the phone call for the official &#x27;Go&#x27; decision. Then the inexplicable happens. Total time needed to complete: 7 hours, including checkout. WTF? Am I happy the upgrade went smooth and finished with zero issues, yes? But, WTF?
 15 minutes after the note to the users that the system was ready, I got my first email from management wanting to know who was responsible for missing the target by 10 hours. Some of the overseas sites are upset because they rescheduled manufacturing and warehousing schedules based on my estimate. Now I have to spend the next week explaining why my vendors seemed to be &#x27;sandbagging&#x27; the non-prod systems and padding their numbers. Plus my credibility next time I go to ask for a production window is shot now.

                              <span>I work at a startup and business has started ramping up. We are now deploying about 100-200 windows 10 devices per week. Each device needs some software uploaded and settings changed. We have been using Ghost32 to image them. With unboxing, imaging, and licensing each device - each unit takes me about 7-10 minutes. 
 I think I am looking for something like Kubernetes or Puppet to help with orchestration. I have also read up of Chef and Ansible. Before I dive really deep into any of these, I wanted to see what you guys are using to accomplish this? Or is there a better way that I am not thinking of?

                              <span>I have been working as an IT support specialist for the past five months. Unfortunately, the IT department has been overlooked and not seen as an asset for the company&#x27;s growth, as they have been focusing on acquiring smaller businesses in recent years. The IT manager has experience with managed service providers and is skilled in project management, with previous knowledge of IT infrastructure. Therefore, the department is being managed by someone who is proficient in growing and documenting processes, as the company has a lack of documentation in general.
 My goal is to better manage the IT department and help it grow. I am interested in knowing the difference between an IT support specialist and a systems administrator and how I can develop my skills to become a future systems administrator for the company. I am eager to learn more about network administration, server management, and security management and pursue relevant certifications, such as Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), or CompTIA Security+. Additionally, I plan to work with my IT manager to develop and document IT processes and protocols, including standard operating procedures and user guides, to establish a strong foundation for the IT department.

                              <span>Having a bit of an issue…
 I’m working on getting a laptop on one of the specific WiFis on Unifi. Here’s the setup:
 NPS running on Windows Server 2022 std (running on Hyper-V) CA running on same server Self-signed cert in trusted store AD group for machines that will use RADIUS (only the one laptop, for testing) RADIUS client is set as UDM which manages 5 APs that the laptop can talk to Connection request policy also set to UDM IP Network policy grants access, is enabled, to Windows RADIUS group, NAS port type 802.11/ wireless Constraints set to auth method PEAP/EAP Cert for EAP set to NPS servers cert RADIUS standard attributes framed-protocol/PPP Unifi RADIUS profile created, shared secret the same for RADIUS client and Unifi profile, ports both set as 1812/1813 (auth/accounting)
 Trying to get the laptop to connect to network X tells me “checking network requirements”, “can’t connect” - does this when I’m running WPA3-Ent or WPA2-Ent, even WPA2- personal with passcode, enter passcode, checks network requirements, can’t connect.
 Any help would be appreciate!
 EDIT: also should note, there’s a duo auth proxy for the VPN that also uses this NPS, has an NPS client set as localhost

 If I say &quot;yes&quot; to the second interview and will start in two weeks, how bad is it to cancel on them if the first job calls me back wanting to hire me?

                              <span>We are trying to decide if per user or per device licenses will be the most economical for server CALs.
 Human employee count vs AD account count? What about service accounts? What about disabled accounts of former employees kept for retention history reasons?
 If you set up per-user licensing for server CALS and a worker has multiple dedicated accounts for specific tasks (daily user account, local admin account, server admin account, application admin account, domain admin account etc.), would each account in AD for each person need to be added to the license count for per-user licensing?

 We are currently in the process of implementing security solutions to effectively manage approximately 300 enterprise devices. These devices are primarily used within the corporate network. Students use personal machines (BYOD), including a mix of Windows and macOS. Currently, we have Fortigate firewalls with 2 redundant internet connections
 We use Azure AD as our main IDP. Our entire workforce relies solely on SaaS apps, we don&#x27;t have anything critical in our university on-prem
 For enterprise devices, we&#x27;re looking for full control, management, 802.1x authentication, and visibility.
 For Student BYOD devices (2000+) we&#x27;re looking for zero-trust access solutions for control and visibility when accessing SaaS apps. Students must have access within or outside the university network.
 We are looking into only cloud options.
 I&#x27;m looking for any tips or recommendations from people who have managed and secured a similar environment in the past. Any help is greatly appreciated.

 We have a task where an input file which is in yaml format with OIDC/Saml App configuration details(from secureAuth) has to be transformed to a xml metadata file or post request with key parameters for ForgeRock(or any other IDP) with the respective value retrieved from the yaml file, to create app configuration.
 Is there any such open source library or project which is currently shared with the community. We intend to design in similar way for this use case scenario as well.

                              <span>So we only have Office 365 E3 and we don&#x27;t have Conditional Access and right now we&#x27;re using the legacy MFA options and have push turned off to stop the risk of MFA fatigue.
 Microsoft say number matching is the default from 8th but when I enabled push in the legacy MFA settings section it didn&#x27;t always do number matching when I logged in to test.
 Sometimes it did number matching and sometimes it did a regular approve/reject push that was just with Outlook and the aka.ms/mfasetup logins.
 Is this normal?
 We&#x27;d like to use number matching and all the guides look like that&#x27;s now the default so I don&#x27;t get why it did a normal push.

                              <span>I am trying to access my web server I made on my local network, but I keep getting &quot;ERROR_CONNECTION_REFUSED&quot; whenever I try to access it. However - it works outside of my home network, i.e. my phone.
 I have tried all the basic troubleshooting steps like rebooting, clearing cache, flushing Windows DNS resolver cache, even gone as far as nuking my PC and re-installing Windows. It is absolutley baffeling.
 My web server is being hosted on a VM in TrueNAS Core, running Ubuntu Server 22.04.2 LTS, and all the usual other packages, i.e. Apache2, MySQL, etc etc. It is a fully functioning server, as I say I can access it from outside of my home network perfectly fine.
 I am not sure if it is the culprit, but I do have a Raspberry Pi on my network running Pi-hole. I have tried to whitelist my domain, disable it, change upstream DNS server between Google and Cloudflare, but to no avail. I&#x27;ve even tried removing it from the network all together.

                              <span>Hi everyone !!
 First I&#x27;m new in admin/network (student/1st y internship in admin) and I try my best to learn the fundamentals sorry if I ask dumb question !
 I have a thesis to do for my school year and my subject is about the implementation of RADIUS server and 802.1X for wired et wireless (via VPN too) connection to network.
 I have 3 questions :
 Is it possible to do a &quot;full&quot; virtualization of this infrastructure ? I want something like packet tracer do(or GNS3 but never used it before) to configure 802.1X on switch port, a windows server with NAPS-&gt;NPS fonctionnality, test wired and wireless login.
 I belive it&#x27;s possible to do 802.1X on packet tracer but for the windows server configuration ? It&#x27;s possible to create VM on packet tracer, or the &#x27;graphical&#x27; interface on the computers is enough ?
 2) Ok for local connection, what about VPN ? It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m learning on my own but never install/configure one from now, is it difficult to link with RADIUS ?
 3) For now I want to build my own classic RADIUS lab but I think I&#x27;m screwed to do it in entreprise... Because we have a hybrid/full cloud infrastructure in Azure AD. I think it&#x27;s a total another lvl of difficulty . Does anyone know more about this ?
 I&#x27;m not alone in my entreprise, we have a provider to take care of network tasks et management but he is not often there and I don&#x27;t dare to ask basic question :(
 I&#x27;m trying to be very proactive on the subject (it&#x27;s for october so it&#x27;s pretty soon I think), I will keep you up about this !
 Thanks

 It would do what I need, but I need a full API not (only) a web interface. 
 It has to be on-premises. No SaaS. 
 We currently use simple relays, but we can’t authenticate the mails and maintaining the IP whitelists is tedious and may not be feasible in the future.

 After 20 yrs with the same company(accounting firm), I terminated my employment and sought out a dream job in the Space industry. It was a long interview (4 weeks), but I accepted a position with a satellite launch company. I&#x27;m a space nerd and this is a dream job for me.
 So if you are looking for career advice, read the forum. I cherry-picked advice and found out what worked for me. So best of luck to everyone looking and another Thank You to everyone posting career advice.

 All devices have the latest iOS (16.4.1) if that helps and all have the ability to scan QR codes from the camera app.

                              <span>Note: the system this post refers to is on premise.
 I&#x27;m not a sysadmin, so I could be wrong about this, but it seems wrong to me that to RDP into the computers in the DMZ, I need to remember/maintain a local windows account for each computer in the DMZ (we have several dozen). These accounts&#x27; passwords also expire after a month, which makes managing the accounts even more difficult. I have searched the web for what is considered best practice, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything I can understand. I&#x27;ve seen a few posts about Read Only Domain Controllers and Jump Servers, but as a non sysadmin, I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding these.
 Now that you understand my question, let me give you a brief explanation of our system.
 The system is entirely on prem. At the front, we have a load balancer with a public IP. This is what our customers connect to. Behind the load balancer, we have the DMZ. The DMZ contains a number of windows server VMs running IIS. Behind the DMZ, we have our AD network. This is where our application and database server are. It&#x27;s also where the computers used by our staff are.
 As a user of the system, my computer is in the AD network. As I mentioned earlier, I sometimes need to RDP into a server in the DMZ. Ideally, I would just use my AD credentials to authenticate, but that doesn&#x27;t work because the DMZ is not part of the AD network.
 So, could you please tell me if the best way to connect to the servers in the DMZ is via local windows accounts? Another thing I&#x27;d like to know is, is a DMZ even necessary? Why can&#x27;t the load balancer just route to the appropriate computer in the AD network?

                              <span>So we have a major SaaS EMR vendor we use by clinical staff (healthcare org) contacting us demanding that if we want to continue receiving emailed daily patient reports from them, due to a &quot;bug&quot; they recently fixed, they will now require SMTP information. From us. To receive emails addressed to us.
 Specifically, we need to provide them with:
  
Mail Server name and port username password default sender email security type(SSL/TLS/None)
  
Has a vendor ever asked you for this information? It seems bizarre we would have to provide our own server to email ourselves. How would you even do this securely?
 Oh, and we can&#x27;t input this information ourselves -- we need to give it to them so THEY can set it up on their end! Sure, I&#x27;ll get right on emailing you a username and password to connect to our Exchange server.
 Our users just want to continue receiving these emails.

                              <span>Hey everyone. So I work in k12 and I&#x27;ve got this project that I&#x27;m working to implement over the summer and I was wanting some advice from those who are more network savvy than I am since I&#x27;m still pretty junior in this role.
 I&#x27;ve got 5 campuses all with their own NVRs on-prem to support their respective IP cameras. Each campus is connected to our main MDF/Server room via 10Gb Fiber connections in a Hub/Spoke topology. The idea here is to get rid of the old NVRs (they suck and require Edge in IE mode to even use) and move everything to a single server in our server room.
 The campuses all have the cameras on their own subnets but while some campuses have a completely isolated set of switches that only connect to cameras and the NVR, some of the older campuses don&#x27;t have isolated switches and simply rely on VLANs.
 So basically this is what I have: 5 Campuses with their own subnets, some with dedicated switches, others with dedicated VLANs (Security).
  
172.16.50.0/24
 172.17.50.0/24
 172.18.50.0/24
 172.19.50.0/24
 172.20.50.0/24
  
I need to remove the NVRs and get them talking to a server located at 10.0.9.75.
 Now what I would *think* I need to do, is simply make sure all physical ports that cameras are located on are simply Untagged with the security VLAN, and make sure all successive uplinks between switches all the way back to the core switch (which the server will be connected to) are Tagged with the security VLAN.
 One of my big concerns is whether or not I need to implement any kind of Layer 3 routing (beyond what we already have) with this setup. I don&#x27;t believe I do, but I would like advice on this if at all possible. 
 Please let me know if it seems like I&#x27;ve left something out or if I can answer any questions that might help better explain. Thank you

                              <span>After the recent incident with Viptela V-Edge we’re looking into a solution to get OOB Console access to all of our branch routers. In addition we’ve been fighting for funding to get a 4G/5G WAN failover for a while.
 Management finally said we can get cellular boxes, if we can get the wan failover piece and the OOB Console Service in one solution, so we can maximize value…
 But as I’m shopping around it really seems more like an “one or the other” situation?
 We want something top of the line, cradlepoint and open gear both look great, but can it do both with one SIM Card?

                              <span>Hi all. I have set all ports on a switch to be vlan 3 and untagged vlan 3. I realized my mistake too late when I couldn&#x27;t access the switch web ui.
 I&#x27;m using Linux and I&#x27;m sort of familiar with creating new interfaces and adding a vlan tag to it but I only mention this because I thought I could just try to access the switch by setting a static IP and vlan.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there really is a way to get back in to it. I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful in my attempts but thankfully I can switch it to unmanaged so connected computers can use it.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking for a fix for my mistake here.

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting security subscription renewal alerts for my Firebox T70 - which has worked great. What&#x27;s the value in renewing? I&#x27;ve never used their tech support, as I have my own team for that. I don&#x27;t need hardware replacement until I have a failure.
 Are the latest security updates worth it?
 My last IT person took care of this and I don&#x27;t recall more than one or two security updates over the years unless he was doing extras on the weekend he didn&#x27;t alert anyone to.
 Opinions on cost and value?

                              <span>Hi r/networking!
 I&#x27;m looking for an open source DNS server that can respond to queries by fetching data from a web API that I will configure. I came across Technitium DNS Server, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet and I&#x27;m not sure if it meets our requirements.
 Our goal is to scale https://pinggy.io horizontally, and to achieve this, we need a DNS server that can respond to queries with data from a database. Ideally, the DNS server would forward the query to a web API that we will create, and the web API will respond with the DNS response.
 Do you know of any open source DNS servers that can do this? Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have only a /24 from the days where IPs weren’t a sacred thing. Across my 4 512GB hypervisor I’m using most of that space on applications for myself and clients. I will be deploying 28 additional machines next week yet I only have /27 left. 
 Will I be able to create a gateway /32 and have a VLAN for each uplink on my switch that will allocate a /32 public address and share the /32 gateway without any security vulnerabilities for packet sniffing between machines?

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;ve been tasked with converting a largish network from mixed EIGRP and OSPF to fully OSPF. I know I can usually run the two alongside each other since default admin distances are different, however, my dilemma is that EIGRP is running everywhere except between a core switch and a firewall out to the internet. The core switch and firewall are OSPF neighbors. The core switch is redistributing the OSPF and EIGRP tables into each other. Can I go ahead and safely stand up OSPF between this core switch and all downstream switches without causing routing loops? Or will I be stuck with taking down EIGRP before configuring OSPF?

 We mostly use it for lightweight access point management &amp; maps, client history (seeing what AP/switch ports a machine has been on), pushing &amp; backup up configs, though this one isn&#x27;t a huge deal as I know there are other good tools for this.

The ASA has a tunnel-group configured in this goofy format (tunnel-group &quot;ABC Taiwan VPN&quot; instead of ABC_Taiwan_VPN, the problem with this format is when setting up Identifier ID on Azure side you can&#x27;t add anything that are quotations mark, my question is what is the best way to fix the tunnel-group naming format within the ASA5500.

                              <span>Our system could not be accessed from a specific site location today. The platform that is hosted on AWS was being blocked because traffic was routing to a Germany region IP and not one of the US East region IPs that our organization is hosted on. Once we unblocked Germany traffic it went right through. We narrowed it down to being a global IP that our phone system should never redirect us to because our org is not hosted in that region
 Without sharing too much information, is it possible that Cisco umbrella or our vpn could be causing this issue, or is it more likely that AWS or the platform provider redirected their traffic due to an issue on their end?

However, I seem to find conflicting information in their documentation on the correct topology. Some of their documents have it connected directly to the LAN, while others have it connected to the gateway.
 For anyone using it in this manner, may I please ask how you have it connected to your network(s)?

 I am not sure if I am at the right place to ask this, but here I go!
 I got a request from our QA team, they would like to have the ability to perform some test on our apps by simulating different network conditions, let say for adding some jitter, latency or reduce bandwidth a very low value.
 I can do some basic bandwidth throttling in the FW, but was wondering if anyone has a suggestion on how this can be perform and/or how I could give them as much control on the test they would like to perform.
 Thanx for you help!

 After rebooting when entering config mode we got the following message:
 No configuration commits for this SDR will be allowed until a &#x27;clear configuration inconsistency&#x27; command is performed. 
 Apparently all the L2VPN configuration was not applied on startup.
 Any ideas on how to prevent this in the future or what I should look into?

 Im looking for technical support:
 I started working for a company where ewe offer terminal Server to our customers with RDP connection and those freeze for some customers. I looked up ways to test the network/protocols/internet connections and found iperf3. 
 Its been pretty helpful so far and I managed to solve/greatly improve the freezing situation with some cusotmers already but one thing keeps happening with every time I test: Trying to run the iperf command with multiple UPD streams simultaniously just starts - Giving me the message about a connection being established with port XYZ, but then just does not run - which I can see because if it runs, it spits out a line for each intervall on what happened. 
 Ive made a post here already, but no answer so far:

                              <span>A similar process has existed for many years dating back to the old Microsoft DirectAccess and their newer Always On VPN machine tunnels, but this question is specifically about the Cisco Management VPN Tunnels.
 First, I am seeing conflicting information whether or not the management tunnel should be full tunnel or not.
 TunnelAll even though it should only be providing access to domain controller, DNS etc. to allow domain joined Windows laptops to sign in without cached credentials? Does that make sense?
 There are also security concerns about the laptops having internal network access using the machine certificate and no password.
 Does the VPN tunnel do real time certificate validation so that if a laptop is reported stolen and IT revokes the certificate and/or disables the machine account in Active Directory, will new connections to the management tunnel access be immediately revoked or will someone managing the ASA need to take some manual action to prevent further access from the system?

 Any Umbrella SIC users here?
 Trying to establish a tunnel from Umbrella SIG and despite following confusing instructions - the tunnel won&#x27;t come up.
 Things get compounded by the fact that there&#x27;s no VPN logging in Umbrella UI.

                              <span>RFC 4604 Using IGMPv3 and MLDv2 for Source-Specific Multicast:
 2.2.3. IGMPv1 Queries, IGMPv2 and MLDv1 General Queries
  
If an IGMPv1 Query, or an IGMPv2 or MLDv1 General Query is received, the SFGMP protocol specifications require the host to revert to the older (IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1) mode of operation on that interface. 
 If this occurs, the host will stop reporting source-specific subscriptions on that interface and will start using IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 to report interest in all SSM destination addresses, unqualified by a source address. 
 As a result, SSM semantics will no longer be applied to the multicast group address by the router. 
 A router compliant with this document would never generate an IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 query for an address in the SSM range
  
How does it make sense, to say &quot;[General] query for an address in the SSM range&quot;?
 I&#x27;m not confusing this sentence with Group-Specific Queries, because for them in RFC 4604 is seperate section.
 Routers send General Queries empty without an address:
 RFC 2236 IGMPv2
  
In a Membership Query message, the group address field is set to zero when sending a General Query
  
And they send it to all hosts via 224.0.0.1.
 RFC 2236 IGMPv2
  
A General Query is addressed to the all-systems multicast group (224.0.0.1)
  
How should it be possible, to forbid General Queries to the SSM range (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255), when all hosts receive the Queries?
 The only possibilites what this means:
  
A Router never generates IGMPv1/IGMPv2/MLDv1 Queries? (But then why it mention explicit for SSM range?)
 I missunderstand something completely.

                              <span>We have a largish data center with a lot of automation centered on Netbox as our source of truth. Very happy with it. (switch configurations, DNS entries, DHCP scopes &amp; reservations all automatically created from the netbox model)
 I&#x27;ve been asked to replace our current DNS and DHCP servers (bind and ISC Kea) with Infoblox DDI. I have no Infoblox experience, but I hear good things.
 I&#x27;m concerned that Infoblox&#x27;s builtin IPAM functionality might interfere (or integrate poorly) with the Netbox IPAM model we currently use. 
 Does anyone here have experience integrating these applications? Thoughts or recommendations on how get the best out of both applications in a highly netdevops environment?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey folks.
 I&#x27;ve been working on an issue with a customer where they have some VPN tunnels going through our service that has some issues affecting speeds for their applications. They have logs from their Cisco FTD about failed anti-replay checking. I don&#x27;t really want to get into the specifics on this, since I think the out of order packets is a red herring, but it did get me thinking about what is &quot;normal&quot; in these circumstances over the internet.
 I took some packet captures from our router at their branch site. I can see all tunnel packets being forwarded in perfect order ip.id 11, 12, 13, 14 etc. On the remote peer of this tunnel, I can see these tunnel packets arriving ever so slightly out of order intermittently, by about 1-3 packets. So for example, 23, 24, 26, 25 .... then 62, 63, 66, 64, 65. Again, a very low number of packets are actually out of order, something like a few hundred packets out of a capture file that is 100k packets in size. I am using the IPv4 Identification field to count and identify the packets, as our tunnel is a single stream, so I believe this should be valid.
 TLDR; As a UDP flow crosses the internet, is it normal for their to a very, very small amount of re-ordering? There is a lot of different physical media used by providers, carriers to provide transport and connectivity. Also, there LAG&#x27;s and different speed links, then QoS and queuing.... I&#x27;m not too experienced to know what is normal here or not. Anyone that can shed some light here?

                              <span>Hi All
 I have a question concerning a topic I never really found much actual objective information about: Packet queues and buffer depth on high throughput devices.
 Obviously not talking about dedicated hardware routers or virtual routers.
 Basically, the argument goes that some people put layer 3 switches at their edge and go &quot;well that works&quot;. And the are right. But some people argue that because of the shallow buffers on those devices they aren&#x27;t suited for edge routing.
 Same in the data center where I heard people say that the major reason that catalyst switches aren&#x27;t suited for data center is the fact they have very shallow buffers compared to Nexus or other data center switches. I know for fiberchannel this is a major issue, but for iSCSI this is... not so much an issue. FCoE, the less said the better...
 Is this BS or is there truth in this? I haven&#x27;t ever heard anything more than anecdotal evidence for this argument concerning buffer depth.
 Thanks :)

                              <span>I have always wondered about the actual benefit of using two firewalls in a high availability setup, syncing with each other and providing redundancy if one were to fail.
 What confuses me is that you have a single point of failure at the WAN switch between them and your modem, which is also typically a single point of failure as you usually only get one handoff. Am I missing something here with this logic? Or is there a better way to truly provide redundancy for WAN interfaces?

                              <span>What would you consider a good amount of time for the following account creation+full desktop setup:
  
User creation, group assignment in AD, sync to AzAD
 AzAD licensing
 Unboxing a computer + OOBE for local admin creation
 AzAD join, change hostname, run Windows Update + OEM&#x27;s firmware update software, reboot
 Login as user, check for any more updates, potentially reboot again
 Install M365 apps + Teams
 Manually license Adobe Team&#x27;s license, install Adobe Acrobat Pro
 Manually license TeamViewer, install
 Install Firefox, set as default, set up a handful of bookmarks
 Manually license and install Egnyte
 Install WinZIP
 Install one bespoke software
 Depending on the user, install one to two more bespoke software
 Install two required Outlook add-ins
 Update one of the add-ins because its public installer isn&#x27;t up-to-date for some insane reason 🙄
 Set Office Apps to compatibility mode for monitors
 Share calendar details with entire organization
 Install organization themes
 Install printers
 Install Zoom and its add-ins
 Clean everything up and run a script to change device owner in AzAD from user to global admin
  
Yes, I know a lot of this could be automated with unattend files, an image server, etc.
 The DC is legacy and needs to be deprecated and everything needs to migrate from hybrid to full-cloud.
 And all those applications should be SAML/SSO.
 But all of those things cost time and money, and I&#x27;ve been told no about each of them.
 I took flak from a higher-up non-technical person today because a set of deployments took a while (in the hours range, not the days range). I&#x27;m wondering how long someone else thinks this takes.
 EDIT: Lovin&#x27; the suggestions so far. One note: as soon as I&#x27;m able to the DC is getting put down, and that is my last device that /could/ run anything like an imaging server.

Want to see if there&#x27;s any one else that makes switches as robust as IOGear but at a more economic pricing. What do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Just wanna thank everyone for their advice in the previous post. I didn&#x27;t reply to many comments but I took the time to read them and consider what was being said. As some mentioned, I tried to re-pitch my ideas using more business terms and to try to frame the proposal as more of a risk management type of thing. The CTO&#x27;s response to that was that it&#x27;s too high-level and she wants more details.
 So I tried again (for the 4th time) with the following 2 items :
 - buying an EDR solution and installing it on every endpoint to protect from ransomware and other viruses
 - buying Windows Pro for the laptops and Azure AD P1
 Both of these suggestions were again rejected because:
 a) they were not detailed enough and didn&#x27;t show how the cost of the licenses would bring value to the company
 b) she claimed that we already have Azure AD. I had previously showed her that we have Azure AD Free which includes very few features and is certainly not enough to get where we want to go. Is she intentionally lying because she doesn&#x27;t want to spend on a P1 license? did she not check the console to confirm what she said? It&#x27;s not like this is a matter of opinion, she&#x27;s just refusing to see what&#x27;s there.
 So yeah, I tried again before giving up but at this point I just don&#x27;t see why I would spend more time fighting with this person who clearly has no intention of helping me in my duties.
 Also note: I confirmed they&#x27;re aiming for ISO 27001 certification - she said they previously had it in 2019 but it expired. Not sure how that&#x27;s possible but I saw the certificate myself so it&#x27;s true.
 EDIT: Just to clarify, the ISO certification is from 2018 and applies to software development and software products and services only. There was no surveillance audit done after the certification and it was not renewed. I haven&#x27;t been able to obtain the documents from the original audit yet to look at what they evaluated.

 Fast-forward 10 years: Currently a hybrid admin for higher ed (aka actual admin tasks like Zendesk / JAMF / Azure / etc administration mixed with helpdesk / desktop support).
 Been here for 5 years and finally feel secure enough in all aspects to take them up on their (basically free) tuition for staff. 
 I previously majored in film but considered pivoting those credits towards something else. I also had to pull a few strings to even get here because my resume was insta-trashed due to no degree in the first place.
 If you had the opportunity for a basically free, albeit slow degree, what would you study?

                              <span>5 years ago I was hired to work at a private school. Helpdesk plus, because they wanted me but my skillset was above helpdesk so they paid me a bit more and gave me more to do. 3 people, 100 employees, 200+ students.
 2 years later the boss leaves for another state. Family reasons. my coworker and I absorb his job, he gets the hot seat and I take on the Sys admin roles and most user facing duties. We work more like a team then a boss/subordinate pairing and life is good, though a bit overworked. We&#x27;re not just coworkers, were friends, and this makes life immensely more bearable.
 3 years later I find myself locking his accounts and shutting down his keycards. Didn&#x27;t have a great year and a lot of personal issue&#x27;s. He left amicably, and there&#x27;s no bitterness about it. it may be best for him to get a fresh start. A least thats what we decided the takeaway should be.
 But that leaves me, a one man shop. I know enough to keep the school running, but I dont even know who I answer to officially. They told me that I&#x27;ll learn how to do the budget stuff for the department Monday, but they literally just had my &quot;Letter of Agreement&quot; renewal 20 minutes before they told my boss he was leaving and there was no discussion of a title change or a raise. Apparently, they&#x27;ve been talking to an MSP and some restructuring, but I&#x27;ve been told my job is secure.
 I&#x27;m still a bit numb and trying to process it all. I don&#x27;t want to leave my job, I absolutely love where I am and what I do. but since everyone else rants on this sub about their job I figured I would pour some stress into the webs as well... And I have so many god damn passwords to change now! (Already started on the major one of course, but holy hell there are a lot)

                              <span>I have a basic folder structure which is:
 D:\Data\Folder1
 D:\Data\Folder2
 D:\Data\Folder3
 Shared out at the &quot;Data&quot; folder level so users map to \\server\data
 It&#x27;s a SMB with no real specific permissions so right now the permissions are basically flat.
 I need to make it so users can&#x27;t accidentally delete or move the top level Folder1, Folder2 and Folder3 folders.
 Generally I avoid deny permissions but for this they seem the most appropriate way of doing it.
 How would you do this please?

                              <span>Been seeing this trend of people working from anywhere with just a laptop! While is sounds cool, I can maybe do a couple hours of work off a single laptop screen but after a bit my neck hurts my back is hurting and frustrated from constantly minimizing and maximizing stuff. Is it just me or does everyone else need at minimum two full sized monitors to be productive and a mouse!

                              <span>I discovered this accidentally, while using PowerShell to review who had access to my calendar. I brought it to the attention of my boss during our weekly one-on-one. After the meeting I audited the person&#x27;s access to mailboxes and found they had full access to Senior Officers mailboxes. This access was not delegated by the affected users, no tickets granting access, no review.
 This is the second time I&#x27;ve caught this person doing this. I&#x27;m unsure if I should take it directly to HR or just let management take it from here. The last time, nothing came of it and it never went beyond the team&#x27;s manager.

                              <span>How do you guys handle saying no to certain requests? I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of requests that are very loosely related to IT lately and I am struggling to know where the line is. Many of these requests are graphic design, marketing, basic management tasks, etc. None of them require IT involvement from an authorization or permission standpoint. As an an example I was recently given a vector image with some text on it and asked to extrapolate that text into a complete font that could be used in Microsoft Word. Just because it requires a computer doesn&#x27;t make it an IT task! 
 Thanks for the input and opinions!

                              <span>I am dealing with 1 forest - 1 domain and multiple OUs, one for each separate site.
 The replication between Domain Servers works fine. 
 I have deployed 2 new GPs to a couple of sites (OUs) with no issues. 
 ​
 Now I am dealing with the 3rd site OU, with the same GPs applied to that site&#x27;s specific security group but they&#x27;re not being applied to none of the PCs or users involved. Enforcing doesn&#x27;t do anything. gpupdate completes successfully but gpresult shows nothing (nothing blocked either).
 ​
 What could be causing this? I don&#x27;t know where to look further.

                              <span>I had a user yesterday receive a phishing email with a link to &#x27;keep his password&#x27;. This email made it through our email filtering. It was sent by a legitimate business whose email address had been compromised. Our associate clicked this link which took them to a website mimicking a Microsoft login page. He typed his credentials in. At this point the malicious party had his credentials and attempted to sign into his account. The associate received the Microsoft Authenticator push notification. The push notification presented numbers that the party attempting to login would need to enter in order to gain access. This was new to the associate. He was used to the simple &#x27;approve&#x27; or &#x27;deny&#x27; buttons on the push notification. He admitted that they would have hit the &#x27;approve&#x27; button if it would have been presented.
 In last month&#x27;s meeting with executive management I explained the the CA policies we have in place for our 365 logins. Only 25% of our 365 accounts need to be able to connect from outside our facility (manufacturing), so we have a CA policy that prevents 75% of our accounts from connecting outside the facility. We also have a CA policy blocking connections from all countries other than USA, with an exception group we can temporarily add an associate&#x27;s account to for international travel. We have a CA policy enforcing MFA for all logins and a CA policy that requires modern auth clients to use approved client apps and protection policies.
 During this meeting I explained that we would be rolling out Number Matching for our push notifications. I explained that the flaw in the push notification is that associates are so used to approval prompts on their cellphones, that the chances of them approving an illegitimate login is quite likely.
 It feels good to have that validation that you&#x27;re not just talking crazy and that the scenarios you lay out actually can and will happen.

                              <span>We replaced our heavy volume printers with Ricoh 8400 machines and the print is way slower than our old HPs. I&#x27;ve figured out the reason is because every page that prints gets flipped in the duplexer even if the print is only one-sided. We have to load the paper in the trays upside down so it will print on the correct side. I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to correct this anyone have any ideas?

 How can I find more info on this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with trying to find out when a user has logged on and off over the last 30 days. I&#x27;ve been looking through the event logs using event ID 4624. It shows so many of them. I need to find the one&#x27;s where he physically logs on and off or RDPs into it. What is the easiest way to find these without going through each log trying to find the logon type? Thank you.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have LAPS deployed to all of our laptops, however its a gamble if the passwords work when I need them to for remote users. From what I understand, LAPS requires Group Policy refreshes and such to check-in or sync from time to time. Since we don&#x27;t have VPN for end users to touch the DC&#x27;s while offsite, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s part of the issue with the passwords not working.
 Am wondering if anyone has an alternative? Just need to run a CMD prompt as Admin on remote users laptops for installs, open Device Manager as Admin etc, nothing fancy.
 One thought is to write a system level service that&#x27;s deployed on all laptops. The service can be invoked under the user context and get permission to run Admin level commands from some from of Azure authentication that doesn&#x27;t require VPN or on-prem DC&#x27;s. 
 I&#x27;m willing to research and develop this, however just want to know if some existing solution is already out there. Not interested in packaging apps with Intune. Trying to make this simpler and &#x27;just work&#x27;.
 What are your thoughts?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 Cant quite find the answer i am looking for so thought i would ask here.
 I have a pair of 2012 R2 Hyper V hosts running a bunch of 2012 R2 Guests with one guest being a 2019 DC.
 I want (Need!) to upgrade the 2012R2 Guest servers to 2019/2022 (2019 based on the up2 suggestions)
 Can i just mount the media and run the usual in place upgrade steps and if so, is it recommended. Will a Checkpoint work for recovery should the upgrade fail? If no to both, what would you (should i) Do to get from 2012R2 to 2019 with the least disruption.
 I will deal with the Hyper V hosts another time; we might be able to replace them with some new poweredge hosts on 22 and just live migrate / replicate the guests over.
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are a machine building company. Up till now, we&#x27;ve been using Teamviewer for remote access to our machines. These machines are installed all over the world, and they all have a Windows PC on board, so Teamviewer was an easy way for remote access/support.
 However we want to move away from Teamviewer for 2 reasons:
 - security : we don&#x27;t want to use Teamviewer anymore, as it introduces a security risk in the customers network.
 - user friendliness: Teamviewer recently had a complete overhaul of it&#x27;s UI. Nobody likes it anymore.
 So as a solution, we want to equip all our machines with a VPN gateway device (eg Ewon or IXON). That way, we can connect via VPN to our machine local network (much safer). Once that we are connected via VPN, we can use VNC to remotely control the machine PC.
 I just started evaluating the different VNC implementations (TightVNC, ultraVNC,...). However they have not changed since I&#x27;ve used them about twenty years ago.
 I am missing drag and drop support for file transfer and performance (fluent updates) is way worse than Teamviewer. I also checked out Windows Quick Assist, but this requires manual starting the connection at the customer side. We need an &#x27;always on&#x27; server service so we can connect to the machine anytime.
 Does anybody has some suggestions for remote access that works (like VNC) only in a LAN (so no Teamviewer, Anydesk, Splashtop,...)
 Thx,
 Thomas.

                              <span>Hoping this is the right spot for this. Yesterday I logged on to one of our servers and got a pop-up telling me that something called Program already existed and could cause issues with programs running. I looked on the C drive and there was a file called Program that was like 125MB in size. I couldn&#x27;t find the original source of the file and my antivirus said it was clean. Today I had a user come to me because they had the same exact thing happen but the filesize was zero. Kind of concerned this may be malware but can&#x27;t verify for sure.

                              <span>Hello folks
 I have a self-build server at home with 8 drives and 4x nVME M2 SSD. Running proxmox on it with TrueNAS VM and my other LXC containers. So my PC case is full now (i have depleted PCIe expansion slots as well).
 On TrueNAS VM I have ZFS pool with 2 vdevs (1 vdev is 2x6TB mirrored 3.5 HDD) with 12TB storage. Yesterday I got notification from TrueNAS that pool is almost on 80% capacity.
 Can I get some tips on how to proceed with expanding storage ? I though about scaling out via Ceph cluster, but I suppose I will need to reconfigure my whole storage for this. I am planning to scale up to 24TB for example. I am using storage for my movie collection(Plex), family photos and games.
 Second problem is I have mounted storage on my promox containers in /foo/bar. Is possible to mount 2 different network storages to same location ie. tank1 and tank2 storage in /foo/bar ?
 Thanks for any tips and explanation.

                              <span>Single sysadmin, about 350 endpoints currently, but we are currently experiencing rapid growth and are expecting that number to be about 500 by the end of the summer. It comes out to around 6k, which I can justify pretty easily, but want opinions before that money gets spent. 
 I am looking into getting SmartDeploy, since I image quite a lot. Being vague, every month we get a new group of students, so I am looking at about 20-30 monthly. Those come back to me after the class ends, and need to get reimaged for the next person. Add on top of that new hires, a lot of my time is taken up with building laptops. 
 These do get taken offsite. 
 I currently have no device management system other than a remote connection software. This was an extremely small company before me, and the previous sysadmin did not scale up his shop to correlate with the rapid growth of the company. I&#x27;m basically building everything up. 
 Anyway - thoughts on SmartDeploy? Pros? Cons? Any other recommendations?

 I am working on stepping up our imaging of desktops/laptops procedures. We use MDT along with PDQ for imaging. However, what alternatives should I look at if our Imaging environment were to get compromised along with desktops/laptops?
 Maybe create a base image with all the applications/settings and slap it on a USB drive? How would you handle &quot;backup&quot; imaging solutions if a Cyber/DR Incident were to occur?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have 5 Domain controllers in my business environment and one of the controllers is only syncing in one direction. It is sending out its changes to the other controllers but when you make a change on any of the other sites this one problematic controller doesn&#x27;t see them. Any suggestions on what to troubleshoot would be helpful. Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>Our company recently hired a new CIO, and a big part of his role will be re-engineering our IT infrastructure.
 The new CIO seems very keen on getting rid of the server room altogether. He wants to move &quot;everything into the cloud&quot; including AD users, servers, network infrastructure, physical firewalls, endpoint security, web security gateway, DNS filtering, 802.1x authentication for wired and wireless users, endpoint management, network performance monitoring, file shares, and all business applications to SaaS.
 Currently, we have only emails on O365, 50% of servers on-prem with a quite traditional network with VLAN routed on the core switch and perimeter firewall high bandwidth redundant internet connections.
 Does anyone else have experience doing this type of transition? What are some of the solutions or architecture you guys would advise to satisfy the requirements?

                              <span>Hello ! I&#x27;m doing a lot of learning in my own labs recently and I noticed something a bit odd.
 I set up banned word list on Azure AD. It includes, for example, all fruits and animals. I understand how the password strength is calculated behind the scenes so even with my word list, the following password is accepted on AAD: Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee!
 ​
 I installed the agent and proxy right on the DC of my VM lab. I check the Event Viewer logs to track what happens. 
 However, this password above is not accepted. I guess it&#x27;s because it has the banned words? 
 So it gives me the impression that the Azure Password Protection agent does an exact match to the word list. If the password contains any of the banned words, then It&#x27;s rejected. However, on AAD, I can change the password to Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee! and Writeback seems to set it on premises as well.
 I feel like I am not understanding something ... Is this the expected behaviour? Or perhaps the configuration is missing something? Is it failing because the default password policy on a fresh Server 2019 DC requires numbers as well? (Just thought of this as I was writing this post).
 Thanks! You don&#x27;t know how much I appreciate comments from experienced admins. I learn so much from y&#x27;all.

 So, this thing is annoying me in such a way that the part of my hair that&#x27;s not falling is getting more gray.
 I&#x27;m removing all Veeam infrastructure servers from the domain in order to get them a little more isolated of the network. I&#x27;ve started with the windows server proxies, as they have less components and I expected to be more easy.
 But, this is where things are getting crazy. When I remove any Windows server from the domain, when it reboots, it gets stuck with the previous user that logged on. If I&#x27;m smart enough to have logged on with the local administrator when removing the machine from the domain, at least I can log in. But if I forget that and use my domain account it get stuck after reboot. There is no option to switch to another user. Even if I log in with the administrator account and try to lock, sign out, switch account, any of that, it just doesn&#x27;t work.
 What am I missing here? Is this the effect of the remains of some GPO of the domain?
 While researching I&#x27;ve come across two policies that could be affecting in that way, but it seems that they&#x27;re not being applied, since the machine is not in the domain anymore.
 Interactive logon: Don&#x27;t display last signed-in &gt; Disabled
 Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers &gt; Not Configured
 I&#x27;ve also tried cleaning the GPOS after leaving the domain, by running: RD /S /Q &quot;%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicyUsers&quot; &amp;&amp; RD /S /Q &quot;%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicy&quot;
 By creating a new Windows Server VM, I can confirm that the normal, non-domain server have the switch user and also lists the local users, if it happens to have more than one.
 I don&#x27;t know what else to check.
 I&#x27;m including screenshots from two servers, one that have leaved the domain, and one fresh install, non-domain. https://imgur.com/a/sS5R6XG

I&#x27;ve worked at both a startup and a corporate position, but I often find myself not enjoying what I do. I have a real hard time caring for what I do, essentially like many other devs I crate software that cuts costs, primarily data entry and data migration. 
 I&#x27;ve found that the biggest satisfaction I get from my work is actually helping people. When people come to me with an error during a UAT demo and I fix it there and then, the recognition from that goes a lot further than me staring at a broken function or a outdated depending for the better part of an hour. 
 I have experience with networking and basic data transfer protocols, but thats as far as it goes. I&#x27;m willing to learn, but don&#x27;t know where to look, what to look for or what jobs can come from this. Any and all information would be appreciated, thank. 
 P.S: should also mention that I&#x27;m based in the UK

                              <span>Turning on the &quot;Try the New Outlook&quot; button in outlook switches to the new version which looks like OWA. 
 It is probably some electron / webapp variant.
 We like most have a lot of business apps and flows integrated with outlook. The new version seems to break plugin compatibility and stuff like signature and contact management seems to be changing too.
 How are handling it?
 Any other thoughts or ideas?

 I see a lot of contract to hire jobs are out there. Are these jobs worth it? It is it better to hold out for another full time gig?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have Server 2008R2 /2012R2 /2016 /2019 /2022, Windows 10/11 clients as domain servers/members.
 Also We have Linux / Unix machines too.
 1 - For only Servers OU , I will apply a GPO like below. Correct ? 
 If we have the following settings:
 Servers: Member servers are in a separate OU (Servers), with a separate GPO (Servers) assigned.
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 OR
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) &#x3D; Disabled
 2 - Is there any a tool to help admins analyze systems and their connectivity, and network speed, and drive speed, and SMB versions installed and come up with a recommendation for the settings?
 3- Has anyone else run some benchmarks with SMB signing turned on and seen this performance hit?

 Presented by the guy who made the decision to force the TPM requirement. Since it&#x27;s supposed to be Read Only Friday today, I think it&#x27;s a good watch IMO for all WinAdmins. Might not all be implemented in Windows 11 but it&#x27;s their goal.
 A few key things mentioned;
  
Enforcing code signing for apps in Windows by default, with opt-out options. 
 
By default, completely blocking script files (PS1, BAT etc) that were downloaded from the internet and other permission limitations. 
 
App control designed to avoid &#x27;dialogue fatigue&#x27; like what you see with UAC/MacOS. OS will look at what apps the user installs/uses and enable based on that (ie, someone who downloads VS Code, Aida32, Hex Editors etc won&#x27;t have this enabled but someone who just uses Chrome, VPN and other basic things will). Can still be manually enabled.
 
Elaborates on the &#x27;Microsoft Pluton&#x27; project - something that MS will update themselves - implementing this due to how terrible OEM&#x27;s handle TPM standards themselves.
 
Working with major 3rd parties to reduce permission requirements (so that admin isn&#x27;t required to use). MS starting to move towards a memory safe language in the kernel with RUST.
 
Scrapping the idea of building security technologies around the kernel based on users having admin rights, and making users non-admin by default - discusses the challenges involved with this and how they need to migrate many of the win32 tools/settings away from requiring admin rights first before implementing this. Toolkit will be on Github to preview.
 
Explains how they&#x27;re planning to containerise win32 apps (explains MSIX setup files too). Demonstrates with Notepad++
 
Discusses how they&#x27;re planning to target token theft issues with OAuth.

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

 It&#x27;s a work smarter, not harder kind of request.

                              <span>I really, really didn&#x27;t need this.
 Apparently a while ago I looked up drug laws in Kenya (marijuana is legal in D.C. where I work and my girlfriend is very fond of it) and as a result, an investigation happened without my knowing until yesterday when my equally confused Lead was informed I had to surrender my CAC and tokens, to be taken off base.
 The job was monotonous and not particularly engaging, but I learned a lot while there, and I do not want to resume going back to the Hells of a service desk position.
 I work overseas and am in no hurry to get back to the states. The job I was just terminated from is in AFRICOM near the middle east, does anyone subbed here have recommendations on where to apply? I&#x27;ve applied to positions with Jacobs, Amentum, and Vectrus so far. Ideally I&#x27;d like to move into another OCONUS position, and I&#x27;m trying to keep my head up.
 Side note: I need a beer.
 Additional note: I miss Popeye&#x27;s and Wendy&#x27;s. *sigh*

                              <span>Hi all,
 UPS are trying to send an email which they say is being rejected. There&#x27;s no sign of the messages on a message trace (Exchange Online) which suggest Microsoft are rejecting it before it even reaches us:
  
mx0b-002b8001.pphosted.com rejected your message to the following email addresses:
  
REDACTED
 Your message wasn&#x27;t delivered because the recipient&#x27;s email provider rejected it.
 mx0b-002b8001.pphosted.com gave this error:
 Local Policy Violation
 Here is a message header analysis - https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Tools/EmailHeaders.aspx?huid&#x3D;6c719633-ceeb-42df-86ec-70ebba6834bf
 ​
  
There is a blacklist from one Outlook.com mail server to another but I can&#x27;t imagine Microsoft would reject messages between their own servers?
 SPF is failing which suggests the IP address of the mail server used to send the message (UPS use ProofPoint by the looks of it) is not an approved sender for UPS.com emails.
 DKIM is failing but I think that&#x27;s related to the ARC relay modifying the message headers and not being a trusted ARC sender?
 DMARC is then set to reject messages
  
Is this purely a UPS problem or are we expected to whitelist their ARC sealers to allow the message through?

                              <span>Hi there, like the title suggest, is there a way to restore previous permissions that were removed by a GPO to clear up all users in the Local admin group of a server/computer? One of my colleagues deployed a gpo which ended up clearing all permissions of non domain admin members.

                              <span>Hello,I was wondering if I could ask you opinions?We have a new network, all Cisco, all very nice and shiny, but it is supplied by a third party that, for cost cutting reasons, don&#x27;t have any monitoring in place. (I may have ranted a bit when they cut this part). We are a subset of their network and they don&#x27;t even monitor their own.My question is, how do I best monitor uptime without access to the devices themselves? A consistent and consider approach. 
 We have on prem and cloud servers. We&#x27;ve remote facilities, without servers on, so I could at best ping the gateways on each site.
 Thank you for any insight you can offer.

                              <span>The problem is as follows, Domain Admins are a privileged group in the Active Directory and as a result, the ACL on these accounts is inherited from the AdminSDHolder object in the domain, where inheritance is disabled by default.
 However the option &quot;Include inheritable permissions&quot; is needed for ActiveSync to create necessary containers. Now if I undestand that correctly it is simply not possible, as a Dom-Admin, to receive emails from a mobile device without doing some icky exlusions. What is the best practice solution to this problem?
 Note that our client is running a 2010 On-Prem Exchange server and 2012 DC, and yes our MSP simply doesn&#x27;t have the size to refuse to work on older infrastructure. Also please excuse any problems with the english, not a native speaker.
 EDIT: it seems like some people are saying to just create a new user, is using a shared mailbox for both users (admin and non-admin) THE solution here? Seems sensible to me

                              <span>I have a couple of R740 boxes running 6.7 with the latest updates.
 They were originally installed three or four years back from the Dell custom ESXi ISO.
 I need to get them onto 7 which should be as simple as doing a firmware upgrade via the iDRAC to egt everything up to date then using the latest custom 7 ISO from the Dell website to do a straight upgrade.
 Appreciate random bad things can always happen but high level is anyone aware of any like major red flag issue with upgrading this way to 7 on an R740?
 It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s brand new hardware or ESXi releases.

                              <span>I know the answer will be no, but just wanted to confirm.
 We have interactive BenQ TVs and I want a lag-free streaming solution that also allows for touch input. The Microsoft Wireless 4K is flawless, but I can&#x27;t see any way for a HID input? 
 The other alternative Miracast products are ridiculously expensive (Screenbeams), or have lag that will make using whiteboarding painful (vivi/non-miracast).
 On that note, why is there lag with the BenQ RM03s? Is it the USB wifi dongle or the processor or software? If a better wifi adaptor resolves the issue that&#x27;d be ideal.

                              <span>I need some help here guys, I am working my ass off to cut down on access , between using non interactive service accounts with specific access to Just in time access for local elevation and rotating random admin accounts and password for work stations. 
 We have very little domain admin accounts anymore some are locked down no login service accounts and a few left for admins , 
 I have been working toward delegating access to cut down even more but we’re at the point where if you’re doing domain related functions you either are elevating with that account or using it for certain servers.
 It’s not perfect but considering we had 60+ domain admin accounts down to less then 10 is an improvement.
 But here is my problem 2 of our network admins think they REQUIRE domain admin access to there job and need to be logging in as domain admin on there daily workstation, using a local account with JITA access is to hard and elevating to use DA when doing specific domain tasks is also to hard.. they have network related functions such as DNS , DHCP and some AD functions via delegation but beyond that I don’t think network admin need more then that right? 
 Can someone please give me some sort of good write up on WHY logging in as domain admins on freaking work stations is bad and why it should be a limited and controlled / delegated function… I apparently can’t write up anything that is understandable enough to raise my issues with this and I need help… please !

                              <span>I manage 7 different physical locations. Each location is fairly small. Our main office has about 40 users or less and the other 6 locations have 10 or less users each. We have no internal resources such as servers or anything of that nature, so everything is cloud based. However, if I want to manage something at another site, I have to remote into a computer there. Such as a web interface to appliance, printer, network gear, etc. It would be nice if it were all connected on one network, but it would only benefit me. The only east way I can think to do it is a site to site VPN. Any thoughts? Worthwhile or any other tips?

                              <span>So I was recently hired to handle the IT department of a large concert venue and it&#x27;s payment systems. I don&#x27;t have much experience in this environment but am pretty sure they pulled a quick one. I wasn&#x27;t given much explanation of job duties or my schedule but when I applied it seemed like a seasonal position that would be typically for show days. That position is apparently still open. My position, Technology Supervisor is like 8 hours a day and longer on show days. I&#x27;d currently be making like $38k a year but now I might have to travel somedays into the city with personal vehicle. This is a big jump since now I&#x27;m paying tolls and dealing with city traffic. I&#x27;m going in tomorrow to ask for basically $40k a year to start. Am I in a good spot since I&#x27;ve already started? Tia Ps the venue is huge, seats over 20k people and id be walking to every stand during the dead of summer.

 Netsh will not run at all. Every time we try to run it there is an app crash log generated and the process dies. 
 We only noticed it because of our VPN client wouldn’t add the routes after connection. 
 I’ve tried the sfc scan and all the dism options but nothing seems to fix it.

                              <span>Good afternoon, I&#x27;m looking for a switch to replace an Ubiquiti Edgeswitch 16 XG (It has 12 SFP+ Ports and 4 RJ45 ports) as a core switch something a little more reliable it will be gateway. Our network is pushing at least 1tb in a 24 hour time span. 
 My question: What are some switches with a competing brand that have the same amount of SFP+ ports? As well as some Copper ports. Without insane licensing fees or am I just stuck?
 Thank you in advanced!

                              <span>I am wondering if anyone has had this issue... 
 I currently have a 4 node Hyper-V cluster. I have decommissioned a few servers and removed them from the cluster.
 The issue is that for some reason this has left the .vhdx file behind and stripped the permissions from the file so it can&#x27;t be modified.
 I have tried runing icacls to add the VM SID back on, however everything fails because there are zero permissions on the file.
 Find it weird that the process in Hyper-V cleans up all of the other files but leaves behind the vhdx file, this has happened across a couple of servers now also...

                              <span>Starting around 9:30am CST this morning we started getting a large influx(from ~100 blocked per hour yesterday to 700-900 blocked per hour today) of blocked spam emails on our Barracuda caught using the Spamhaus ZEN feed. Looking at the logs most of it seems like actual spam but some legit emails are getting caught all of a sudden. 
 Is anyone else seeing something similar today?
 Something else that&#x27;s interesting is that over 50% have a source address of mail-{xyz123}.outbound.protection.outlook.com

                              <span>I consider myself especially late to the game with respect to DKIM and DMARC. At my last corporate gig I didn&#x27;t have them set up until around 2021. I don&#x27;t know when I started using SPF but it was probably 2018. 
 One of the services I&#x27;ve been providing since I started freelancing is configuring email authentication for small businesses and a minority of them have it set up. Which I&#x27;d expect...I mean it&#x27;s not usually automatic and they don&#x27;t know they should set it up. I&#x27;m happy to take their money. 
 However, it also seems pretty rare among IT companies I encounter.....even companies purporting to specialize in Cyber security! I&#x27;d estimate a quarter of the IT companies I look at have no DMARC record at all, 25% have a record, but policy isn&#x27;t enforced, and another 25 percent have the policy enforced. 
 So what&#x27;s the deal? Did I miss the memo saying that stuff isn&#x27;t important anymore? Do I just encounter shitty IT companies? Is everyone so busy installing NGAV and EDR systems that they neglect the basic stuff?

                              <span>Has anyone had issues getting an excessive number of blue screens from Dell Inspiron 3505 laptops?
 It seems like our company received a bad batch a little over a year ago, so I was curious about how wide-spread this issue is. We&#x27;re currently sitting at almost 50% of them (that we know of) having daily blue screens, all from the same issue: bad RAM. From my testing, it seems that these laptops are killing the RAM sticks. I ran memtest86 in one of them and it showed a ton of errors. I replaced the RAM, ram memtest86 again which passed all the tests, and then a week later it started having blue screens again and failed memtest.

                              <span>I have a very strange issue with WDS where I now can&#x27;t approve pending devices on a new server that we setup using Server 2022. The previous server was on Server 2016. 
 When I install WDS on the new Server (in Standalone mode, same mode WDS was using under previous set up) I can&#x27;t approve any pending devices and get an &quot;Element not found&quot; error message. 
 WDS settings used: 
 PXE Response: Respond to all client computers (known and unknown) - Require admin approval for unknown computers is ticked. Boot: Known/unknow clients: Continue the PXE boot unless the user presses the ESC key DHCP: Do not listen on DHCP ports - unchecked, Configure DHCP options to indicate that this is also a PXE server - unchecked TFTP: Maximum Block Size: 0, Enable Variable Window Extension - unchecked Rest are as defaults 
 I&#x27;ve found that if I untick &#x27;Require admin approval for unknown computers&#x27; the devices skip the pending stage and will image fine but I need to be able to retain control of which devices can receive an image through PXE. 
 I also have found that I can click the Approve and Name option, give the client I am trying to image a name and run through a wizard without filling in any of the other options and it then works. I found the flat file that contains the approved clients on the old server and every device has a name like &#x27;Domain Admin1&#x27; &#x27;Domain Admin2&#x27; and so on. It&#x27;s not the end of the world to have to do it this way but I&#x27;m still hopeful there is a way to get it to work like I had on the older server where I could simply right click the client and hit approve.
 The new server is domain joined member server only with just the WDS role installed. DHCP remains on a different server. I&#x27;m logged into the new server with admin rights. 
 Just can&#x27;t see what is causing this, any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got an issue where a user can&#x27;t move subfolders up and down to place them in the right order. 
 ​
 I don&#x27;t want to place them from A to B but a custom view. When i try to drag folders up and down its possible to do like shown in this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/hojf1vV.png A black bar appears and when i release it it puts the folder there. For the user, the black bar doesn&#x27;t appear and she can&#x27;t move anything up or down, only place folders inside of other folders. 
 ​
 Anyone know how i can fix this?

                              <span>TL;DR - Has anyone else run into employees using low-cost VPN providers and how have you dealt with it?
 We recently implemented a robust security platform and have since discovered that about 10 of our work-from-home users are using low-cost VPN providers to connect to our corporate resources ( We do not have or require a corporate VPN in place for access as all of the resources are publicly web-based). We found that a few of them are choosing to have endpoints in South America and Europe. Despite the increased latency from the VPN and the subsequent latency from the endpoint location they are picking (we are US based), 9 out of 10 of these people aren&#x27;t technical and have no idea why they are using a VPN apart from it making them &quot;safer&quot;. 
 Much like other employers, we now state that employees must have their own reliable internet connection at home, but that&#x27;s where it stops. Keep in mind that these low-cost VPN providers are not being installed on any corporate-owned devices and are either being installed on their personal PC that they are then accessing things like OWA or other web-based resources, or a few that have installed and setup the VPN inside their home firewall and is funneling all traffic from their internal network through the VPN. Please refrain from suggesting to just shut their access off. I am looking for how others have handled this situation and not suggestions on how to screw the users over.
 The real-world impact of the users using these VPN providers is that it affects their performance, sometimes creating &quot;impossible travel&quot; alerts when they switch endpoints, and possible blindspots to security threats (as explained in the next sentence). I am hesitant to create policy exceptions in the security platform as the threat hunters indicated that a lot of real-world bad actors use these VPN providers to help add an extra layer of obfuscation when attacking a target.

                              <span>Greetings everyone, long time lurker and sysadmin for 10+ years here.
 I&#x27;ve been having an SMB connection issue in my evironment for about a month now and I&#x27;m stuck. Essentially I have SMB connections dropping at random. Could be a mapped drive or an open file in excel. 
 Typically to recreate the issue I have a drive mapped to our file share and I work with files on the shares. When the connection drops my mapped drive shows connected but shows no used space indicator. Try opening the drive and it askes for authentication; however, any authentication is met with access denied. If I unmap the drive or in some cases the drive won&#x27;t be mapped but I have notepad++ open with a file from the share it will recover.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried all the typical troubleshooting with SMB. Wireshark shows the access being denied, almost looks as if the client thinks it already is auth&#x27;d but the server sees it as anonymous. Wiresharked both client and server and confirmed they are communicating. Procmon shows nothing useful. SMBClient, server and connectivity logs show absolutely nothing about my user ID even authenticating or anything related to my connection.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried using the DFS share, regular UNC path with hostname and IP and still get access denied. It&#x27;s not tied to one specific client, server or user.
 ​
 Really stuck on this one if anyone has an idea.
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a weird issue, hoping someone can help.
 I&#x27;ve got an issue where mapped drives (to a local networked NAS) get mapped fine, however they will randomly disappear from File Explorer. If I issue a &#x27;net use&#x27; command, the drives are listed in an &#x27;unavailable&#x27; state.
 I can still ping the NAS by both IP and name when the drives aren&#x27;t there, and I can remap them fine, but I am struggling trying to figure out what may be causing this. Sometimes even logging out and back in will cause the drives to disappear.
 I should add, that there is no local domain, the machines are AAD joined.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a bit of a pickle here and could use some advice. I&#x27;ve got an application that requires a physical USB token (a Yubikey) to be plugged into the machine. The application itself is lightweight, running smoothly on less than 1 GB of RAM, and the daily traffic it generates is just a few MB.
 Now, I&#x27;m wondering what my best options are for hosting this application. What type of datacenter services should I be looking into? Should I go for a private setup or consider bare metal?
 I&#x27;ve thought about buying a server, plugging in the USB token, and colocating it in a datacenter. However, that might be a bit of an overkill. So, I&#x27;m hoping to explore alternative solutions before taking that step.
 If any of you know of a datacenter that would be open to accommodating this unique requirement, I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you could let me know. Feel free to reply here or drop me a PM.
 Thanks a ton!

 I saw some companies asking candidates to record a video asking screening questions about their profile to understand their profile a little bit better before an interview and I became curious to know your opinion about that.
 Have you ever tried to do something similar? If not, why, and if yes, how were the results? Do you believe it&#x27;s a good thing for the candidate and the interviewer?

                              <span>The only thing holding me back from rolling it out everywhere is that, on systems that are reimaged that are already in an OU where LAPS is applied, the LAPS password breaks the MDT setup because of the changed password. 
 If it resides in an OU where LAPS isn&#x27;t applied, it works fine. 
 I&#x27;ve tried moving the &quot;join domain&quot; to the end, but that hasn&#x27;t worked as anticipated. I have a task in MDT that deploys the VPN, but it has to be on domain before it does that in order to get the necessary certificates. 
 ​
 We are using the LAPS that got released last month. We had the same issue with the old LAPS, but it was decided to handle administrator passwords a different way back then. This year, we planned on going to LAPS, and the new version&#x27;s release just sped up the deployment. It all works perfectly for new builds, but rebuilds it crashes on, and I know there has to be a better way of handling it than just manually moving/deleting the old computer and letting it rebuild. Personally, I&#x27;m fine with that, but help desk isn&#x27;t thrilled, and they&#x27;ll just forget to do it before they deploy, and we&#x27;ll end up with a semi-broken, half-baked system

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered why there are no ADMX editors. Today I had once again a registry key, I could push via GPP, but it might&#x27;ve been much nicer, to create an ADMX for that use-case. So I asked Google and once again I wasn&#x27;t able to find something for that use case. 
 I then thought: Today there&#x27;s a Visual Studio Code extension for almost anything, so of course there will be an ADMX/ADML extension for VSCode. But no, there isn&#x27;t. 
 Am I blind? And if not, does any of you know why there aren&#x27;t tools out there, to create small ADMX/ADML files for us MSP based sysadmins?
 Thanks for some insights!

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 I am looking for a software that will draw a FULL network map:
 ​
  
I list all the Switch and Access points, including: 
 IP
 admin or user credentials
 SNMP data
 
 It should draw a map that includes those switches and all devices (at least mac address) connected to each port of each switch.
  
I tried a few software (the one I&#x27;m testing now is PandoraFMS), but they draw only the switches and APs.

 I am experiencing an issue where I can no longer edit my own created Outlook calendar events. The edit button has completely disappeared and I simply no longer have the option to edit the events (Outlook for Windows and Outlook for web).
 Any ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on getting a large number of passwords off of a very bad storage mechanism. We have 1Password quite a few users in the company and we&#x27;ve been trialing it with this department and they like it. The only issue we are running into is that we don&#x27;t know how they are going to access these passwords on our POS machines. Each machine has a different AD account, which is shared by whichever user is on the computer. 
 What they are doing now is independently maintaining a shared Chrome account with the passwords saved, but ideally I&#x27;d like if all the passwords could be maintained in one place. 
 Is anyone else using a password manager on shared accounts, and how do you have users authenticate?

                              <span>Background: I have a VDC where I run warm backups of certain servers offsite for DR purposes. This is VPN connected via 1Gbit Fibre.
 Problem: Some additional Directories on various machines need to be synced to a single server in the VDC. What method is best? Should I use AD DFS Replication, or maybe another utility. 
 All machines are backed up and synced to a different Veeam Repository off-site, restores will take a while, therefore the warm backups.

                              <span>Well, basically the title. We got our hands on a few Igel Thin Clients through a refurbished shop on ebay (not some backyard sale - kind of shop but one with a long history of selling on ebay various kinds of refurbished material). Model M340C to be specific. We plan to use them as emergency backup devices, y&#x27;know? Worst case and that, in case everything goes wrong, you have some old devices in a box that you can pull out and use with a temporary license. 
 However, the devices seems to be still configured with the data from the former owner. Not that there is much to harvest, it&#x27;s set to load a website that&#x27;s not existing anymore and that&#x27;s all. As far as I can tell at least. However I can&#x27;t get into the admin settings to delete the certificate or other settings as it&#x27;s password locked.
 Igel Clients can&#x27;t be reset to factory settings (as far as I know) without involving the Igel support (think of it like the 48 character code for bitlocker locked devices) and that might require some informations of the previous owner, that we don&#x27;t have. I&#x27;m confident that they still may help us however, that would be a bit time consuming to prepare that codes for all the devices and the discussion with them. 
 So I hoped that someone might know a different workaround, if I can access the device on a different way and get rid of the certificate that prevents me from adding it to the managment suite and so on. 
 Also I hope that since the devices are not reset, that the former owner also didn&#x27;t removed the licenses. Since that requires a maintenance subsription with Igel, there is a solid chance the license is still on it and is hardware/MAC bound. A reset would remove that.

                              <span>We have recently started making some software, and we have to give occasional updates for customers for fixes etc.
  
 Currently, 1 person has perms to share from the SP/OD to the customer, but I&#x27;m not a fan because his range is too wide and its development updates. So carries risk + I don&#x27;t like the sharing direct from the SP/OD.
  
 So I want to find a way we can give the updates, and they are customer specific, so they are not the same across customers.
  
 I wondered about using a private file upload site because at least then we can email the customer the link and have it expire in &quot;x&quot; days etc. We would still need to find a way to limit his transfer ability, maybe 1 folder in the SP he can copy the file to that allows upload?
  
 Can anyone give me any ideas, pointers on how you handle this?

                              <span>Anyone else seeing odd taskbar behavior in Win11 (22H2 - Pro)? Disappears, icons are missing, blinks. We’ve seen this with a handful of users out of about 250 users on Win11. Only commonality is Office 2021 Standard and an AS400 terminal program. Swapped laptops, reimaged, and the issues follow. Tried an image via MDT (same image all machines get) and loaded the OS from a USB. I’d really hate to roll them back to 10, but for the sake of their sanity I may need to until we get this figured out.

 I believe this is to limit costs on the analytics software licensing. Obviously this is a major security concern (MFA is not enabled).
 Do I need to pull the cord on the parachute and exit?

                              <span>Good afternoon everyone!
 I tell you my problem and my scenario set up.
 I have a site to site VPN between a Wachtguard Firewall and a Mikrotik Hex Router, connected without problems via IKEv1 in tunnel mode with IPSec in Tunnel mode.
 The ping from the Mikrotik subnet --&gt; towards the Watchguard Firewall subnet is executed correctly with a constant speed of 28 ms without interruptions TTL&#x3D;126
 The problem I have is when I connect via Remote Desktop from the Mikrotik headquarters to the server where the Watchguard Firewall is located.
 The speed is very very slow, and the connection quality is poor. Disconnects from set slow.
 I have tried to configure with IKEv2 in a way with another encryption protocol in PHASE1 and PHASE2 with identical results.
 Also to rule out, I have configured with Firewall Wachguard headquarters A and remote headquarters B and the RDP connection is established correctly and smoothly.
 I have increased the UDP connection tracking time to 20 seconds, but with identical results.
 OS version is 6.49.7
 I&#x27;m new to MIkrotik and I can&#x27;t find any clue that I can solve, thanks!

                              <span>What&#x27;s a good VPN option for businesses (road warrior) that supports Azure AD authentication (+ MFA)? We&#x27;re currently using the community version of OpenVPN but are planning to phase out our AD setup and only have AAD left (with MFA enforced). While I know that the paid version of OpenVPN can support this, I’m interested in exploring other (more polished) options. We need a network VPN for our employees. A terminal server/VDI environment isn&#x27;t sufficient. Any suggestions (commercial/open-source)? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>We have a problem with Teams on M365 Outlook. The Teams add-in does not appear on the ribbon. If we add it it is greyed out.
 We have not been able to get it to work.
 In M363 admin we see:
 &quot;Multiple users not seeing add-ins in Outlook If you test Outlook add-ins and none show up, as a first troubleshooting step, use the Get-OrganizationConfig PowerShell cmdlet to query the AppsForOfficeEnabled parameter. If the query returns a value of False, set this parameter to True by using the Set-OrganizationConfig cmdlet, so add-ins appear as expected.
 We do not recommend that the AppsForOfficeEnabled parameter is set to False. A value of False overrides all of the above Administrative and User role settings and prevents any new apps from being activated by any user in the organization.
 For more information, see Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/add-ins-for-outlook/specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins#user-roles?WT.mc_id&#x3D;365AdminCSH_SupportCentral&quot;
 We have tried the stuff that is mentioned, and on pages referenced by that page. Can&#x27;t get it to work.
 It does work if the user has admin rights. So either something is not being installed properly, or something is silently getting denied access at run time.
 Does anyone have any ideas please?

                              <span>Hi all, I was wondering if anyone has come across any issues within their laptop fleet in regards to Microsoft Azure VPN client constantly (VPN can disconnect continuously throughout the day).
 From what we seen so far it seems that the disconnect is triggered locally but isn&#x27;t initiated by the users.
 We&#x27;ve tried removing a lot of the dell bloatware (optimiser being the prime suspect) but the same disconnects are still occurring.
 Does anyone have any ideas on why the VPN client would cause constant drops across a fleet of around 150+ with a mix of dell and surface laptops.
 Thanks in advance for anyone for their time.

                              <span>Hi. We’ve got users who run reports in Excel using ODBC connections to some SQL databases. I’m looking at upgrading the SQL server from Windows 2012 R2 and SQL 2014 to Windows server 2022 and SQL 2022 but I’m struggling to find concrete info if the ODBC driver connections from users laptops would continue to work for this or if it’s still supported. Anybody able to provide any further information on this?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m happily using Amanda as a backup system with a Spectra Stack library. Everything works well however my setup to optimise at best the tape usage doesn&#x27;t really satisfy me. One step at a time.
 Amanda has a &quot;one tape per run&quot; approach which means that every time &quot;amdump&quot; is run Amanda would use a new tape. The creator had its reasons to design this in such a way and it is mainly for reliability: to spread around the data. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Amanda is pretty clever in planning the backup within the dump cycle nonetheless I end up with a lot of tapes only partially used because of it&#x27;s default approach (and probably my imperfect setup).
 I&#x27;ve solved this issue by using &quot;flush-threshold-dumped&quot; which, as stated in the man pages, &quot;will not begin writing data to a new volume…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks!
 After a year and a half in the helpdesk, a Comptia A+ cert and a CCNA, I finally made the transition I was looking for and became a sysadmin in a new company. It was an incredible move for me, and I was looking forward to taking on more responsibilities and challenging tasks. However, after a few weeks in my new role, I&#x27;m starting to feel a bit disillusioned.
 The main issue is that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually doing much sysadmin work. My days seem to revolve around managing Mosyle MDM and SnipeIT, and apart from that, I find myself with a lot of downtime. I&#x27;ve brought this up with my manager, but they haven&#x27;t given me any additional responsibilities yet. Do not even have AD access.
 Now, I understand that every job has its slow periods, but it feels like hours are passing by with me not really contributing much. It&#x27;s becoming demotivating, and I&#x27;m starting to question whether this is the right company.
 I do enjoy the moments when I get to dive into more technical tasks and troubleshoot complex issues, but those seem to be few and far between.
 I know how challenging is to break out of the helpdesk role so..., fellow sysadmins, I need your advice. Have any of you experienced similar situations early on in your sysadmin career? Is this just a temporary phase, and should I stick it out a bit longer? Or should I start considering other options? Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.
 Note I recently started working from home 2 days a week, which is something I was looking for from long ago. Those days at home, I am basically getting paid without doing anything in 8 hours. Its ridiculous.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Tl;DR: Zabbix 6.0 or Centreon? Need at least monitoring for Windows, Linux, VMware host/vCenter status, server IPMI and Veeam backups.
 I work for an MSP with SMB. I&#x27;ve implemented Zabbix 5.0 as a monitoring services for our clients. Some are directly connected some via zabbix proxy.
 Since mainstream support for Zabbix 5.0 will end this month I am looking at either migrating to 6.0. We need to monitor:
  
Windows and Linux OSs
 VMware hosts/vCenter (with host discoverability)
 IPMI of servers (for hardware issues) 
 Veeam backups (this one is critical)
 Don&#x27;t care about fancy
  
I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution basically by first checking readily available Veeam integration. Found Centreon, but could not find enough recent feedback on reddit. Any thoughts on the product?
 Zabbix is awesome, but not perfect:
  
Not easy to display which customer the host belongs to
 The Veeam integration that we used does not monitor backup copy jobs
 Proxies are annoying to deploy and manage

 I installed EVE-NG on GCP and have access to the URL login page. When entering the credentials for native console or HTML5, nothing happens. No errors or failed login attempts.
 I followed troubleshooting steps here and nothing worked.
  
To fix permission, enter this command in eve-ng console or ssh “/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions”
 Fix eve-ng SQL database using “unl_wrapper -a restoredb” in your eve-ng console or ssh.
 The hard is not full
  
Fix is to use &quot;Admin&quot; not Root when logging in

                              <span>What do other people do?
 I manage 7 different physical locations. Each location is fairly small. Our main office has about 40 users or less and the other 6 locations have 10 or less users each. We have no internal resources such as servers or anything of that nature, so everything is cloud based. However, if I want to manage something at another site, I have to remote into a computer there. Such as a web interface to appliance, printer, network gear, etc. It would be nice if it were all connected on one network, but it would only benefit me. The only east way I can think to do it is a site to site VPN. Any thoughts? Worthwhile or any other tips? I know nothing about SD-WAN but interested in knowing more about it if it would be cost effective? My initial reading is that it’s not for a SMB like us, but I just started reading about it.

 I got great advice and even had people reach out offering their help.
 Ultimately we are leaning towards a 1gb DIA connection and bursting to 10gb. We were able to get this quoted at $900 on 5 year contract with Crown Castle with a /26 for 64 dedicated IPs.
 What we plan to offer is along the lines of: 
  
 100/100 - Included in HOA fee ($8 increase)
  400/400 - $39 add-on
  1000/1000 - $99 add-on
  10,000/10,000 - $299 add-on
  
The reason for this was ultimately to avoid friction from getting it installed in building and wanting to be able to tell units that they can get 100/100 fiber-backed Internet for a $7.50 increase in HOA dues (we are including savings from eliminating Comcas…</span>

                              <span>so I am creating a pcap script using the pcap third party lib in C. I have basic knowledge of the networking such as the TCP/IP model and was looking to apply these skills in a short script that sniffs packets based on pre determined rules such as listen to packets from port 443 and does a DNS lookup based on the source ip to get the domain and displays in a table format. Nothing too fancy because my knowledge of networking past this point is limited. I am using pcap documentation and am using a wireless interface(wlp2s0). The first problem I am receiving is with the pcap_lookupnet which should return network and mask ipv4 addresses such as (192.168.32.4 and 255.255.255.0). When ran the expected returns results are not returned instead the network number returned is 43200 and mask of 16777215. documentation I am following.

 Distro - Ubuntu 22.10
  if(pcap_lookupnet(inter4,&amp;net,&amp;mask,err_buffer)&#x3D;&#x3D;-1){ // triggered if lookupnet returns -1 indicating failure printf(&quot;Could not find ipv4 address of sniffing device&quot;); return -1; } printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,net); // returns 43200 ?? what is the significance of this number printf(&quot;%d&quot;,mask); // retuns 16777215 ?? what is the significance of this number

                              <span>We are currently using solarwinds config mgr with scripts to prompt pulls of software for upgrades via ftp or tftp. Obviously not secure. We have tried scp but it’s slow for copying over iOS images especially to large amounts of devices at a time. What have you found that works best, is secure and reliable?

                              <span>Hi, my destination antenna is a DynaDish5 and I have to buy an antenna for my place, can I connect it with an LHG5 or do they have to be identical ( I guess dynadish is on ac with wifi 5, but LHG5 is on n with wifi 4 )?
 I also have a similar question with PowerBeam 5 .

                              <span>Hi there. My company are considering moving to a bigger office and discussions have been taking place about ISPs and whether or not we should get a managed ISP router or not. I&#x27;ve never been involved in an office move before so I&#x27;m trying to educate myself. What is meant exactly by a managed ISP router? I thought when a business signs up to an ISP the connection comes with a router that they can connect their firewall into for example. What&#x27;s an alternative setup?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m going to keep my question brief and give as much of an overview as necessary so that you wonderfully smart people can guide me in the direction by way of articles, advice, tips or tricks.
 I am in a pickle. We currently use a vendor who provides us with a service which is awfully useful to us. Without going into incredible detail for the sake of brevity, this service provides us the ability to present our remote cellular routers as existing within the same vnet and from here, we can monitor them with SNMP.
 The reason we do this is because we need to reboot these routers each day, the routers may also be rebooted without warning or reason - and because they are cellular routers, each time they reboot they obtain a new public IP. 
 This, therefore, makes it rather hard to simply probe their WAN interfaces. 
 Anyway, what I need to do is find away to effectively recreate this service as our vendor is doing away with it - gee thanks! 
 I am looking at using an NVA inside of azure - I’m not bothered by the vendor right now, I just need a POC - this NVA will be the VPN headend for our remote routers and I am hoping to present to them a subnet from which we will deploy our sensors to to provide remote monitoring.
 At the moment, I am using a Sonicwall NSv - but I fear I’ve vastly over simplified matters. The testing of my IPsec VPN policy between a remote site and the NVA shows packets coming and going on ports 500, but the ports on 4500 are being dropped somewhere.
 Now this isn’t a tshooting question (I’ve got other posts for that - and yes I’ve enabled NAT-T, IP forwarded on the azure interface, etc etc) 
 What this post is asking is, am I looking at the solution correctly? Is a site to cloud solution the best thing to do? We do not have the ability to use on prem equipment - we don’t have our own core network! - so our needs are pretty much all cloud based.
 Anyway long post over - thank you

                              <span>hello all! looking for some advice on install, i am in canada btw so i won&#x27;t have access to some stuff like meraki go etc
 I will be doing another smb wifi accesspoint install. In the past few years I have done two installs in which both required about 10-20 accesspoints and at that time I went with unifi and till this day everything is working great. So for my next scheduled install I was going to bite the bullet on unifi again but thought i would get some insight on some other brands/products. I did some searching around and seems like for my price range Unifi vs Engenius Fit vs Aruba Instant On is all kinda in the same price range so I guess I am looking to compare that.
 Truth be told, my budget is max the cost of a unifi install, I could slightly raise it if need to but don&#x27;t want to surprass the budget of what a unifi install would cost me.
 Right now for this install I am planning around 30 accesspoints, probably need 1 x 16 port switch + 2 x 8 switches or maybe 4 x 8 port switches + whatever else i need to be able to run captive portal/splashpage and will run whatever router i can find that they provide or is recommended.
 maybe i am old school but tbh uap ac pro have been good enough for me (i really doubt people need more speed) but i guess maybe it is time to make the switch to wifi 6, maybe it will have better range?
 i did some brief searching and my potential unifi build was something like this
 6 x 5 packs of the uap ac pro/nano hd (will buy whatever i can find in 5 pack?)
 udm dream machine or udm pro
 unifi poe switches
 i don&#x27;t think i want to pass a budget of 8000$ cad tbh (this is what a unifi with nano hd 5 pack would hit)
 i know if i went with engenius i would be able to comfortably fit wifi 6 under my budget but not sure if the product is superior. also for aruba instant on seem like they are pricey as well and prob similar to unifi in price range but not sure if they are better etc
 thanks!

                              <span>Short version: My predecessor signed the company up for pretty meager service with Spectrum and I&#x27;m trying to renegotiate our 3 year contract to get higher throughput at a hopefully lower price. We&#x27;re only 8 months into it so offering to renew the contract doesn&#x27;t get them excited. What other levers are there to get an ISP to up your throughput at the same or lower price? What else could we offer that they care about?
 Long version: We have two fiber circuits through Spectrum - 1g directly from them and a 100m carrier diverse circuit managed by Spectrum but actually provided by some combination of GTT and Frontier. We reach 90% of our capacity up and down at least once a day so I&#x27;d like to get that second connection up to 1g to A) provide more headroom and B) have a viable secondary circuit. If a backhoe finds our sole 1g line, we&#x27;d be in for a lot of hurt trying to run the business on the 100m alone.
 But we&#x27;re only 8 months into our contract. I&#x27;d hoped to get better service at a lower price by renewing (I&#x27;d originally been led to believe we were half way through our contract) but they&#x27;re not interested. Is there anything else I can offer them to sweeten the deal in their eyes? All they&#x27;re offering right now is to increase our throughput on the secondary line with a corresponding cost increase. 
 They&#x27;re also posturing that they resell price they&#x27;ve received from GTT/Frontier is something they have no control over even though the number Spectrum gave me for a 1g Frontier connection is 30% higher than what Frontier quoted me directly.

                              <span>Sorry if topic title is not worded well. I&#x27;ll admit: troubleshooting obscure issues with wireshark is tricky sometimes. My problem is, our workstations are so darn chatty.. at any given slice of time, even during a 1-2 minute pcap, there is usually dozens of tcp sessions, to random microsoft IPs, and other cloud IPs... very difficult to pinpoint exactly what is interesting traffic, if you don&#x27;t know an exact destination hostname or IP address. I&#x27;ve tried doing things like wait until exactly when the minute changes to click the button and then look at the time fields on the frame header to try to match up when stuff happens, but sometimes it&#x27;s just not effective.
 Edit: Feel the need to clarify a bit and defend my ineptitude.. say you are troubleshooting an O365 issue, with something like Outlook.. so you have absolutely no idea what IP the app is talking to because it&#x27;s usually got like 30 TCP sessions out to O365 IPs.

                              <span>Hi,
 I try to configure some shaping on a OPNsense router (virtual) to avoid drops on the next hop, which is located on the WAN interface. 
 Setup:
 [IPerf Server] --- [1 Gbit/s Link]----[LAN - OPNsense Router - WAN] -----[1Gbit/s Link] ------ [Devices with 400M policer]---- [1 Gbit/s Link] ----- [IPerf Server] 
 So I try to upload[1] from first/left IPerf Server, to the other/right IPerf Server but it seems the Device with the 400M policer gets overrun and drops packets.
 So I need to shape all OPNSense outgoing traffic to this device to about 400 Mbit/s.
 Already made some pipe and Rule but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effects.
 Any ideas?
 (Download gets close to 400Mbits)
 Thanks

 Will the latency be increased significantly? What are the other implications?
 Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Greetings, fellow Redditors! We are in the planning phase for a new school site and looking to establish both LAN infrastructure and a video surveillance system.
 It&#x27;s worth noting that the regular network traffic at the new K-12 school site (600 students, 100 staff, 250 Chromebooks, 80 Windows laptops ,couple virtualised Windows Servers, 20 printers, 8 MFC, up to 200 smartphones, PBX with a dozen DECT units only for staffrooms) will primarily consist of internet-bound activities utilizing a 1 Gbps symmetric connection. The majority of data transfers will be directed towards the internet, while a smaller portion will be allocated for local traffic, such as printing tasks and access to a limited number of local resources on the file server, if necessary.
 The proposed video surveillance system will comprise 55 PoE cameras, with each camera potentially requiring up to 10 Mb/s bandwidth to the local recording server (total of 550 Mb/s) and monitoring workstation. As we consider the impact on the LAN, we would appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.
 Switches are planned to be stacked and interconnected in a dozen racks connected to the MDF through 10 Gb/s fiber links.
 I am enclosing a rough rack ports count, which includes a full option (all wall ports connected to switches) and a minimum option (all cables connected to patch panels, but only required ports effectively connected to switches, to lower initial number of required switches).
 https://i.ibb.co/kgKRzzH/Screenshot-6.png
 We are curious about determining if dedicated appliances are necessary to effectively manage the network load. Your expertise and suggestions are highly valued. Thank you!

                              <span>I moved over in to tech sales a few years ago, so I&#x27;m a bit out of the loop for how things are being done these days. Previously companies I worked for always had physically seperated DMZ environments, using different switches than those in their main data center, and having all the VLANs trunked up to a firewall pair for inspection &amp; routing.
 In this day &amp; age though, where VXLAN ovlerays have become popular, and SD-DC solutions like NSX and ACI are in the mix, I&#x27;ve been wondering as to whether or not DMZ environments have physically converged with the rest of the data center.
 What have you guys been observing? Is physical seperation still a common thing?

                              <span>So I saw a few comments about helpdesk tonight that rankled me a little bit, and make me wonder what the technological or managerial solution is for this.
 The long and short of it is, users shouldn&#x27;t share passwords. 100%. Password sharing is bad, security risk, I get it. I also work for an organization that says I can&#x27;t have 30 minutes of an employee&#x27;s time to set up their new computer with them. I have to hand them their computer in a ready-to-go state so that it is a seamless transition from their previous device to their new one. So despite all of our imaging tools, our ability to deploy software from MECM, I still need user credentials for the final hand-off to achieve leadership&#x27;s requirements.

 How long does your company keep these?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve looked it up left and right on google, but I can&#x27;t find a definitive answer... Apologies in advance.
 I need to know what I need to do to give our help desk guys the ability to join computers to the domain and unjoin them as well. When I&#x27;ve researched it, I seem to get a plethora of answers that revolve around modifying domain root permissions, which I&#x27;d not like touch unless I know exactly what is needed. 
 Apparently, their ability to do so existed at some point before I joined in the company, but it broke shortly before I came onboard.
 There is already an AD group that they are all a member of, but from what I&#x27;ve looked at in AD and our GPs, I can&#x27;t find anything that ever tied them to being able to join/remove. For reference, there is already a GPO that makes them local machine admins of computers in our root/&quot;Workstations&quot; OU. Nothing touching the doman root\Computers container. 
 My best guess is that I need to give them write permissions to the Computers container (and our Workstations OU), so that they have the ability to join/remove, but I don&#x27;t know what needs to be done exactly.
 Any input is incredibly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>For some context I&#x27;m 15 years in to a career as a sysadmin in a specialized industry. So I know my strengths and weaknesses, and well aware I have a long stretch ahead of me, and I&#x27;m not looking forward to it. And it&#x27;s not really about the work, but it also kind of is, in what I&#x27;ll be expected to do if I remain in my current role. I&#x27;ve always gone above and beyond learning about the business around me, and I want to follow my interests. In my situation pay would not be an issue, and hiring managers are positive about me in the role, however I&#x27;m just not sure I have all the required knowledge when it comes to things like R and statistics. A lot of us here have some interesting career paths, this can&#x27;t be that unique and frankly I think it&#x27;s a huge asset to have sysadmin knowledge in a data analyst role. Has anyone else gotten out of sysadmin in to a data analyst role or something similar? What did your path look like?

                              <span>My team manages several kiosk type company PCs that are connected to large format printers. They receive updates via SCCM through the Software Center.
 Updates are made available for 2 months and then automatically applied. We desire that our updates be applied at a specific time but sooner than 2 months.
 It&#x27;s just three machines so right now we have a person that goes around, open Software Center, and initiates all of the updates.
 I&#x27;m wondering if it would be possible to run a scheduled task accomplish this?
 (I know the easiest solution would be to modify the deployment SCCM, however our organization works in silos and powers that be have decided that no machines will automatically update for 2 months.)

                              <span>My fleet of 20 of these things has been crashing on teams, and the camera/mic dies mid meeting for my users. Sometimes it&#x27;ll BSOD/Lock up entirely needing a forced restart. Logs aren&#x27;t indicating anything is wrong, and when it does, it&#x27;s usually too generic to narrow down. 
 I&#x27;ve escalated to M.S for support but they want log capture the same week/day of the ticket, which is so difficult because these crashes have been so rare / user specific I can&#x27;t capture them at will. 
 I&#x27;ve had a very bad experience with these things...
 What has been your experience with these devices?

                              <span>So, context. 
 I&#x27;m trying to do some professional development, skill up and certify predominantly on VMWare based systems.
 The environment I&#x27;m looking to deploy and test and figure out is large and out of scope of what my business needs, but are where I want to go professionally. They don&#x27;t have a test environment suitable for me to test this nor willing to fund one for me to test VMWare Cloud Foundations which has sizable hardware requirements, etc etc. 
 Now while I do understand there is VMWare HOL but they&#x27;re very instance based and strictly guided on what&#x27;s being taught, not a test lab where I can go start to finish which is where I find I learn best. 
 Outside of buying a Host at home, which where I live is expensive to purchase even a crappy HPE DL G8, are there subscription based services where I can pay for a lab environment to test that&#x27;s strictly for learning purposes? Really trying my best to actually follow in a career that I want to go in but getting super hamstrung with what I have available to me.

 I&#x27;m not going to do it. I don&#x27;t want to work closely with his toxic manager and it&#x27;s a lot of extra work for no additional pay. They won&#x27;t fire me because they don&#x27;t want to pay unemployment. They want me to quit and are being assholes. Can they force me to resign? This is in NY state

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m working on a class project that features a theoretical stock trading startup. The focus of our design is on redundancy and latency. If something fails, we need to be switched within under a second. Each tenth of a second costs the company $100,000. 
 I&#x27;ve been searching to try and find a solution that does two things,
 - Streams changes from the live server to the standby server (two VMWare boxes) with little latency.
 - If the live server fails, the standby comes online in under a second.
 I&#x27;m assuming stock trading companies use some sort of specialized software, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any info that might suggest what that is.
 This thing must exist? Any thoughts or suggestion much appreciated.

These printers are on the company network and we do not allow personal devices to connect to the company network, only the guest network, for obvious security reasons. We also have the printers locked down, no AirPrint, CloudPrint, etc. for the same security concerns. 
 Since this request came from the CEO of the company, the Director of IT says to set it up for him. Help Desk gets this done, enabling AirPrint and joining his phone to an internal company WiFi network so he can reach the printer.

                              <span>I work as the solo IT person/manager for a SMB (250 employees, 75 PC&#x27;s, 7 different physical locations). They used to outsource their IT to MSP but since hiring me, we are doing away with that. We have some locations that have Sophos firewalls and some that have no firewalls. I want to standardize everything but don&#x27;t particularly want to invest in more Sophos. I don&#x27;t love their product, but don&#x27;t hate it either, just kind of in the middle - unimpressed but it works ok. By the way, I have a good grasp on networking as I&#x27;ve been in the industry 15 years, but I&#x27;m really a jack of all trades and a master of none meaning I&#x27;m not a network engineer so I want something easy to manage. We are lucky to have no on prem servers or anything special, so have a very easy/uncomplicated network topology. Everything is cloud based, SaaS, Azure AD, soft phones, and just desktop PC&#x27;s/laptops and printers. Also no VPN requirement since we don&#x27;t host anything. My requirement is to have something very easy to manage, uncomplicated, yet provide great protection.
 When I replace the Sophos and purchase 7 new firewalls, I&#x27;m looking at the following.
 Palo Alto - Seems to be geared towards enterprise, no doubt one of if not the best in the industry for protection. May be too much to manage 7 of these without network engineer level experience on top of all my other duties?
 Fortinet - Seems to be a great solution, runner up to Palo Alto, maybe cheaper depending on the model. Easier to manage but still plenty of protection?
 Cisco Meraki - Seems to be expensive for what it is, less feature sets, but very easy and reliable. However again we have a simple network so don&#x27;t need many features just something that works. Licensing is a little expensive, and if you don&#x27;t pay up, your firewall stops working.
 So with my requirements and the firewalls I&#x27;m looking at, any recommendations if you were in my shoes?

 Not sure if any of you have been impacted by this Cisco Vedge issue. Boy it is creating quite chaos around here. I work for a large bank and we have multiple site complete down. Seems to be a ticking Time bomb! I have linked the article below from Cisco. Seems like all us lower level IT (myself included) will have to go on site to the affected sites and upload a newer cert as Cisco has deemed that to be the best solution at this time. They don&#x27;t seem to have one created yet but hopefully soon.

                              <span>So, working at terribly ran, family owned SMB, and we have a new IS Manager (third one this year, the ran the 1st one off after 17 years and the 2nd guy didn&#x27;t last a day). He&#x27;s pretty good in most respects, but is definitely on the side of the owners of the company when it comes to what he focuses on and how he chooses to resolve things.
 Well, recently, I and the rest of the department- and soon all departments- have been asked to provide all my work account passwords- not vendor accounts, domain admin accounts, server passwords, etc. That&#x27;s all already in a KeePass database that the owners have access too. No, now they want to be able to log in to any account at the company &quot;in case something happens.&quot; In other words- they want us to store every user&#x27;s password where it&#x27;s available for them. Again, the framing is &quot;in case something happens.&quot;
 ​
 Currently- I think they&#x27;re afraid of losing knowledge/access, because they sense they&#x27;ve got 1.5 of my 2 feet out the door already, and the IS Manager/my Jr. Sysadmin are not quite ready to handle everything I do. Or, it could be due to the numerous other major players that have left the company in the past 2-3 years. Either way, it feels like a kneejerk reaction more than someone trying to make sure disaster recovery controls are in place.
 Color me stupid, maybe- but is this not illegal, even if they own the company and thus the accounts?
 At the very least, am I right in feeling like I need to get the fuck out of here before the owner uses my admin account to delete somebody&#x27;s email or something else illegal?

 ​
 Basically they pay me max 8hours for one day a week, but management told me I must check tickets daily and send them to someone who can handle since I am not there... is this normal in IT?

 I work as a Systems Engineer in IT and have been tasked with finding a platform that will provide information security training and keep employees up to date on current topics and threats. I will utilize add&#x27;l resources to find what I am looking for and figured I could start here. The first that comes to mind is KnowBe4, but I have not had time yet to research if they offer a newsletter of some kind to get the job done. Thoughts?? Suggestions?

 I have run across a need to setup a mailing list with external and internal users for communication with our logistics company and another supplier. The problem is, if we manage the Distribution list and It is replied to by an external user on the list, one of the business won&#x27;t receive it if they are running strict filter settings on their mail security system due to it not passing SFP. If we all run different mailing lists it makes for a struggle with keeping associated emails in the same thread when replying and those lists will get out of date and key people may not be properly informed. 
 Say we Have &quot;US Corp&quot;, &quot;Corp A&quot; &amp; &quot;Corp B&quot;
 if the distribution list that everyone uses is managed by &quot;US Corp&quot; ([List@USCorp.com](mailto:List@USCorp.com)) 
 an employee at Corp A sends …</span>

 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/set-password-to-never-expire?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide

 ​
 Problem is this line doesn&#x27;t work
 To set the passwords of all users in the organization so that they expire, use the following cmdlet:
 ​
 PowerShell
 ​
 Copy
 Get-MGuser -All | Update-MgUser -PasswordPolicies None -PassThru
 ​
 it says the pipeline has been stopped, input object has full value for input object.userID
 ​
 Any idea how to is it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not bashing this guy or anything. I&#x27;m far from a perfect employee and way too new to the job to be a good sysadmin. Its just bizarre and something that I notice a lot. 
 Yesterday, my coworker approached the team with a server &quot;issue&quot; he found on one of our monitoring programs and proposed a potential solution.
 Here&#x27;s the thing:
 I found this issue back in March. Brought it to my team&#x27;s attention, investigated it and documented my findings. Then coordinated with the networking team to discuss resolving it. 
 We found that the &quot;issue&quot; has literally zero impact on performance, and the act of resolving it would require bringing down the server&#x27;s application. And my bosses boss said that he didn&#x27;t think that tradeoff was worth it. Bringing down an important application for several hours to &quot;fix&quot; something that doesn&#x27;t affect the server or the application, whose only impact is a very occasional alert on a monitoring program. 
 The ultimate resolution was to leave it as-is. 
 So I told my coworker that, showed him my work, and forwarded him the email where everyone agreed that it was a non-issue. 
 But apparently that wasn&#x27;t good enough, and he proceeded to bring the application down on his own, with no conferring with the team, against the wishes of everyone else who already worked on the problem, to perform the &quot;fix&quot;. 
 I swear, this guy sometimes just does things for the only reason of creating the appearance that he&#x27;s &quot;fixing&quot; problems that aren&#x27;t actually there.
 We haven&#x27;t had our daily meeting yet so no one has discussed his decision to do this on his own yet. So we&#x27;ll see how that goes. But geez. 
 He otherwise does good work, and I&#x27;m not casting stones because I have my faults too. So I just find it odd that he chooses to do things like this.

                              <span>Hello. I am a total noob for tape backups and am a little lost here. I would appreciate any advice.
 I have been working in tech for a long time and manage a lot of infrastructure, but I have never needed to back something up to tape. Currently I work at a research institute and we have to keep data for a very long time, and we want to fill up a fire safe with a bunch of tapes for this reason.
 My data environment is a mix of offline hard drives, NAS, and some compute clusters.
 My problem is I do not really know what to do here. Dell keep trying to get me to buy massive units that will fill up my racks and store a bunch of tapes inside them as a managed system, but all I need is a way to write to the tapes and then remove the tapes to the safe. I think to this end I can either get an external tape drive, or a small server with a tape drive in it so everyone relevant can access? Am I correct here that I dont need any substantial hardware.
 Secondly they keep asking me about software, what I am going to use to write the tapes for storage. Having looked in to it it seems it is not so simple as drag and drop, and I need a software package to write the data to the tapes. My question here is, does anyone have recommendations for a lightweight software program I can use in an enterprise environment for this? I dont need anything comprehensive just occasional writing to single, unmanaged tapes.
 Apologies if these are silly questions. I have been struggling to find simple directions for what I need to purchase.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins. I am currently serving the the US Marines as a sysamin. I am thinking of transitioning to the civilian sector, kinda done with military lifestyle and want to be with my family. I have reservations for finding a quality salary to match the pay and benefits I have now.
 I&#x27;ve been in the field for about 7 years but realistically, IT only fills like 30-40 of my time at work. Mostly AD user management, vm management, help desk services and network management. I feel like my skill set is too wide and I can&#x27;t command a high salary for a senior sysadmin or project manager.
 If I don&#x27;t transition, I&#x27;ll end up being forced into more personnel management which is not what I want to do. I want to remain technical.
 I just graduated in the fall with a BS in CompSci and have Sec+. Planning on attaining CCNA in a few weeks. 
 I just feel like I don&#x27;t know enough or be competent enough to comfortably transition. Sorry for the ramble, coming to the end of a 24 duty post and I&#x27;m a little tired.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m wondering how many company has moved to Windows 11. I have pressure from my boss to start moving computer to W11 (although not even 25% of my fleet support it and they won&#x27;t replace the computer). They say everyone has moved to it while I&#x27;m seeing only Windows 10 everywhere I look except maybe one or two place. Latest survey I saw online was 20% computers are now on W11, but that include consumer and since they are sold with W11, it&#x27;s normal this number grow.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I hope you&#x27;re all doing well. I recently got a new server for setting up our own virtual environment, moving away from using an MSP and ESXi. We opted for some Dell servers, nothing too fancy since we&#x27;ll only be running about 3 or maybe 4 Windows VMs.
 Here&#x27;s the thing: I&#x27;ve been going through the Dell documentation, trying to understand how to set up BitLocker on this server. I&#x27;ve used BitLocker before on laptops and old servers, where it would prompt for the key or passphrase upon reboot. But now, it seems like because this server has a TPM 2.0 chip, that might not be necessary?
 I&#x27;ve come across conflicting guides and articles from Dell, so I&#x27;m feeling a bit confused. Our server has two drives: one for the OS and another for data storage (a few 2TB drives). When I go to manage BitLocker, I have the option to save the recovery key to a file or print it. So, I saved the key on a USB drive and made additional backups on OneDrive, our NAS, and SaaS backup. For now, I&#x27;ve only enabled BitLocker on the OS drive using the &quot;used space only&quot; option since it&#x27;s currently empty.
 But here&#x27;s the weird part: after rebooting, it didn&#x27;t ask for the key. Many of the guides I&#x27;ve found talk about selecting the TPM module and setting up auto-unlock options, but my server just boots up without any prompts. I&#x27;m assuming that for the second drive, I can simply right-click it and enable BitLocker in the same way.
 Is this normal behavior with a server that has a TPM chip? Does it automatically unlock BitLocker? To be honest, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping for, especially since I plan to move to remote management soon (if it&#x27;s allowed). I want things to be easy during patching nights and remote maintenance.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any insights or clarification on this matter. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I’ve been asked to look at this as an alternative to our Horizon on prem setup.
 I’m a bit dubious about the maintenance of the BYOL offering, but otherwise it looks like it can do the job.
 Does anyone have experience with it for 200 users?

 We got a bad drive in from Seagate fresh out of the box with 5000 bad sectors, sending it back, but when we checked the drive with Seatools I noticed it was reporting 54hrs of use. Is this just their burn-in test time, or may this drive actually have seen use and then been resold by Amazon after a prior return?

                              <span>Hello there, 
 Recently have enforced MFA (we work exclusives with the MS ecosystem and use AWS for our VM&#x27;s ) across the business with some conational access rules set up too. BUT there seems to be a small issue for WFH users.
 There OneDrive/SharePoint sync need to be resigned in every 4 hours ( that&#x27;s the frequency sign in for wfh users) and users keep forgetting and then there work wont sync up with our db. that is integrated with MS cloud storage 
 Yes this is a user issue but I need to make this easier for users, is there a way OneDrive can stay signed in on the users device but ever other app related to MS still needs the MFA input? Is there any addition security risk with this as well?
 Thanks, 
 A fellow lone sysadmin

                              <span>Hi All
 Like others, we were caught out by the CVE-2023-23397 vulnerability and inability to quickly get devices patched. We ended up sending an update command to devices via ConnectWise but walked away from the experience acknowledging the Semi-Annual Channel (and our current configuration) doesn’t get security updates quickly enough. 
 We are keen to get on the Servicing profiles in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin centre but we have some business software that integrates with Office, installing Add-ins and therefor the Software company only support the Semi-annual channel to give them a decent lead time on fixing new Office features - I’m presuming their devs are on the Monthly channel.
 My questions are:
 Is there an intention for MS to bring other channels into servicing profiles? And if so, any ideas on when that will be?
 What is the best strategy on keeping the Semi-Annual Channel safely patched. We are a Hybrid org slowly migrating devices to Intune and we are about to stand-up AutoPatch.
 Thanks!

 after we install May Windows update, we will need to
  
Run command to copy Code Integrity Boot Policy to EFI partition
  
​
  
Change the registry
  
​
  
Restart the device
  
​
  
Wait 5 minutes and restart the device again
  
​
  Wait at least 5 minutes and the restart the device again Important: An additional restart is required to fully initialize the revocation protections. 
 ​
 what&#x27;s supposed to happen during the 5 minutes?
 ​
 Maybe it needs to be online to retrieve something? Or maybe it&#x27;s to wait for a delayed start service?

 we are currently facing a flood of alert from MDE - did Microsoft maybe change some kind of detection? 
 Is anyone else facing this?

 Previously on W10 I could see the RSAT tools and run them under my admin account, however, after upgrading to W11, I can no longer see the shortcuts.
 I have checked there installed and if I log on as an admin there exactly where they should be and work just fine.
 ​
 Is there a way to make the shortcuts appear on a non-admin account or am I missing something obvious?
 ​
 ​
 EDIT# I found a solution that works, essentially creating or copying the shortcuts shown to admins will allow non-admin users to run those tools as an admin or other user as usual.
 Shortcuts located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools by default.

 The only workaround I&#x27;ve found so far is to crash Edge and re-launch almost immediately which is fine until you open a new instance of Edge (regular or InPrivate) before it happens again. 
 Appears that users affected are running the same build as those without issues (113.0.1774.35)
 Anyone have any ideas? Been having to install Chrome as a temporary workaround for the time being...

                              <span>Dear all,
 When we try open Outlook from Azure Virtual Desktop, it&#x27;s like we should have the credential pop up appears in the screen but we don&#x27;t have it and finaly we are not able to open Outlook.
 It seems to be a FSLOGIX issue because outlook is opened from multi session VM.
 We are using Hybrid configuration (all computers and servers are Hybrid ADJoin), and we have 2 hosts (vm) fro Azure Virtual Desktop that are in Azure AD Registered(they are synchronize by our AdConnect server). 
 Some advices on my situation?

 Background info:
  
O365/Azure/Microsoft:
  
we have a handful of basic licenses for system email addresses for use in another software application (so that sending from that software comes from a generic address rather than a specific person.
 also have the normal licensed user accounts and email addresses
 currently all are required to do regular password changes, MFA is on.
 
 Other Application: 
 &quot;System Emails&quot; must be configured for ANYONE sending from that software - so, we have both individual accounts in as &#x27;system emails&#x27; as well as the generic &#x27;from the software&#x27; emails.
 I set up app passwords for the generic address emails - but it keeps stopping at the Microsoft password entry screen.
 
 
We have been stuck in a holding pattern - each side is sending me to the other for resolution :) I&#x27;d just like to know if anyone here has had luck recently setting up an App Password and using it somewhere - without actually needing to type a password? 
 OR - any suggestions as to ways to still be &#x27;secure&#x27; but not have the hassle of sharing a password for this generic email (we are really cracking down on how many sticky notes or passwords written on whiteboards). ;) 
 Was thinking separate password policy for those emails with an extremely long character requirement and no expiration?

 What do i have to configure in forefront of issuing a certificate with dns-01 challenge, besides the EAB-Keys and the API-Token which i already got to work?
 Do i need to have other DNS-Records configured, besides the A-Record for the subdomain?

                              <span>So I’ve run into a bit of an issue and it’s raised some questions. It was brought to my attention that one of our facilities’ wifi network had run out of IP addresses. Upon investigation, I found a bunch of MAC addresses that didn’t register to a vendor. I checked the firewall and each address had traffic indicative of an Apple device. (Apple Maps, ICloud, FB, etc). 
 There were roughly 26 different MAC addresses with similar traffic, each reserving a different IP via DHCP. I then checked the wireless controller, and found only 1 iPhone was actively connected. This was during normal working hours. 
 Did this 1 iPhone reserve 26 different IPs? Apple mentions the MAC address changes daily when “Private Wi-Fi Address” is enabled, does it also change when hopping from one access point to another under the same SSID? Did this individual leave a trail of DHCP reservations everywhere he walked in the facility, hopping from AP to AP? 
 Has anybody else dealt with this?

                              <span>Hi there
 We have a new network provider who has sold us business WAN connections in the form of L3 links across their network (inside our own vrf). I need to establish branch-to-DC connections across this provider network. I was wondering if it was worthwhile tunneling (GRE or vxlan?) our traffic across rather than just BGP peering in on both sides and routing through. From a privacy or complexity standpoint is there anything to be gained?
 I know the correct way to do it is most likely is a gateway/VPN/SDWAN type setup but that&#x27;s out of budget for now. What we have is L3 switches at both ends (Aruba CX).
 I&#x27;ve mostly only dealt with dark fibre and L2 provider networks and OSPF routing, just wanted to get opinions before deploying something that might cause headaches later...

The default gateway on each vlan as defined on the core is 10.1.2.1(port 3 on firewall). DHCP is handled on a server on the 2 subnet 10.1.2.20. The default gateway for e…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 The company that I work for is decommissioning an AnyConnect VPN Portal and as of result I need to remove the soon-to-be legacy portal from the AnyConnect Agent from all end-user. Initially, I thought if I take the existing XML File config and remove the legacy Portal from the Server List. then upload it back into my AnyConnect Configuration in FMC that would remove the portal name as an aviavable option for users to see, however, it still shows up.... Does anyone know how I would go about removing a VPN portal from an AnyConnect Client for all users? Is there something that I am perhaps missing? Do I need to create some form of a XML negate statement?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a difficult time finding an answer to this SR-IOV question.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a hypervisor and create 8 VFs (Virtual Functions) on a 10G NIC, then attach one VF to one VM - 7 VFs are not used.
 Does the total throughput capacity get split up evenly across all VFs - so you would get 1/8 of the total throughput capacity of the NIC per VF, or does one VF have all of the NIC&#x27;s available bandwidth until more VFs are attached to VMs? Does this differ between driver configurations?
 I&#x27;m asking these questions because I saw someone bonding VFs together, and I was wondering if it was because of this or not.
 If anyone knows the answer to this, could you please direct me towards some reading information about it?

 Apologies if I am not posting in the correct place.

                              <span>Hello, thank you for reading. 
 Here&#x27;s the scenario we are dealing with: 
 We have a new building we need to extend our network to. We cannot reach this building with a microwave or fiber, so we purchased a leased line and created an IPsec VPN tunnel from Building A to Remote Building (Building B).
 The end goal of this project is to have Building B fully connected to our network, able to access wireless, fileshares, voip, etc.
 Typically, when we deploy a new building, we simply extend vlans to the building over fiber or microwave. Basically create the Vlan/IRB on the core, and trunk it to where it needs to go. 
 There are a few problems here, one of them being I have no control or say over what is configured on the firewall, and the person who deploys our firewall is old, stubborn, and very hard to work with. That being said, his VPN Tunnel works just not how I need it to.
 Here&#x27;s the other problem: His tunnel provides us with a single LAN. Say 10.10.10.1/24 . We are only able to configure a single VLAN based off this, and the remote location needs roughly 10 VLANs. I have asked him to join me in a call with Cisco to see if we can figure out a solution and he says he doesn&#x27;t have time. 
 So yes I know you cannot help me in dealing with this difficult Person , but I was hoping someone could lend some best practice, tips, or advice. I have a strong feeling there must be a simpler way of extending a network, however my experience is limited.
 If you need any clarity on anything, feel free to ask. Thank you

                              <span>So I have a Draytek 2866 that about 5 people connect to using SSL VPN but one of those five uses Three (UK 5G network) broadband as the person&#x27;s remote and traditional broadband is not an option. Except for that one user, everybody else can connect using SSL VPN and work just fine. For that user, we have IPSec over L2TP setup and that works fine, but we want to move over to SSL VPN completely but the SSL VPN connection on that laptop is dropping packets. We isolated it to be because of the ISP but the funny thing is that the same ISP on the same laptop seems to work with GlobalProtect, PulseSecure &amp; CiscoAnyConnect - all running SSL VPNs so why does the Draytek Smart VPN client not work with SSL?
 I&#x27;ve meddled around with the MTU on both the laptop and the mss value on the draytek but neither of them have made a difference. Appreciate your comments.

                              <span>Hi,
 First of all, here is the CV I&#x27;m looking for advice on.
 I tried posting this on r/ITCareerQuestions but the post just ended up getting downvoted (no idea why) so thought I&#x27;d try my luck here instead.
 So I&#x27;m 33 years old and have been in IT since I was 18. I had a couple of random jobs before that but this is more or less all I&#x27;ve ever known. I started at 1st line (Service Desk) and progressed to 2nd line support, then finally to 3rd line (Network Engineer) in 2017. Most of my time is spent tidying network cabinets, patching cables in at the data centre, installing / replacing customer hardware, carrying out surveys, troubleshooting slowness tickets, etc.
 I enjoy my job but I feel like my time to fly the nest is long overdue - there&#x27;s no chance of promotion anytime soon and I&#x27;m not …</span>

At a DC site it says both routers need to be on the same site ID which makes sense, what I don&#x27;t get is how are they redundant? Is there no vrrp or BGP peering between the two routers? Is the redundancy purely based on the fact they have the same site ID? And they use the vSmart for redundancy?

We went into testing, and things just didn&#x27;t work. A significant portion of the internet just wasn&#x27;t available. We could easily reach and resolve from all of the public DNS providers we tried, but basic web browsing was very hit and miss. We rolled back, and upon troubleshooting it was found that another AS is actively advertising our IP range. The name of the org is pretty vague and generic, and I can&#x27;t find anything on them by searching. I am trying to find if there is a public database of AS holders with contact info, kind of like with domain names. Does that exist? What else can we try?

 I ask because when I configure the IKE portion it is clearly listed as &quot;aes-gcm-256&quot;.

 Some of our endpoints are unable to authenticate and get an APIPA address on our cisco 802.1x wireless environment, and the issue seems to happen on some days and go away on others. The ISE logs show nothing or EAP abandonment. Here is a sample of the logs pulled from an endpoint. Any ideas?

                              <span>1) The question is i’m running some wifi stuff on some dicey electricity so i want to protect it should i be getting a voltage regulator and a ups? Or would a ups be good enough
 2) And if i use them both what is the way to do that plug in the ups and then the voltage regulator or vice verca?
 Also the thing that makes the electricity dicey is it’s go out a lot. Lot’s of fluctuations but also the standard here is 120V and we’re receiving 90V yes i know this is a bigger issue that needs to be fixed
 3) But with the 90V is that enough input for the regulator and ups to work? Or is there a required minimum input 
 4) Also do these devices require the plugs they use to be grounded for them to work or is a hot and neutral good enough? 
 https://www.mercadolibre.com.mx/regulador-de-voltaje-koblenz-rs-1410-1410va-entrada-y-salida-de-120v-negro/p/MLM17328307
 This is the regulator i want to buy, i returned it because it wasn’t working and then realized after it could have been because the voltage was so low or because the plug wasn’t grounded. I hope the link helps with the questions sorry it’s in Spanish.
 Hope someone can help i’m not getting that far with google 👍

                              <span>Yes I understand all the interference and other issues that may arise when on 40MHz and I also understand the recommended non-overlapping channels that should be used are 1, 6, &amp; 11. It&#x27;s my understanding that for 20MHz you must use 1, 6, &amp; 11 because they do not overlap.
 But if I simply want to test out 40MHz for learning purposes, pretty much every link just repeats using 1, 6, &amp; 11 but aren&#x27;t those 20MHz channels?
 My understanding (which may be wrong), that on 802.11n OFDM Channels 3, 9, &amp; 13 are the 40MHz channels.
 I also think I understand that channels 3, 9, and 13 do overlap other channels but that can&#x27;t be avoided since they are 40MHz in width.
 So with all that being said, is it realistic to use, let&#x27;s say channel 9, for testing? To gain some real-world expectations while doing bandwidth tests on that channel. With the assumption that there is weak and extremely limited interference from other wifi signals.
 Right now just in testing the 40MHz channel width does yield more bandwidth than when using 20MHz as expected but I wanted to make sure my test was realistic??
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am trying to get a multipoint layer 2 service to come up between an ASR 920 and an ASR 9006. The ASR 9006 is new to me, I have several 920s and I have no issues with doing MPLS layer 2 circuits between those. I thought I had everything configured correct but I cannot get the l2 virtual circuit to come up.
 ​
 sh mpls l2transport vc Local intf Local circuit Dest address VC ID Status ------------- -------------------------- --------------- ---------- ---------- VFI vc-1 \ vfi 10.0.11.19 1106 DOWN 
 ​
 Here is the configuration for the 920 IOS XE side:
 bridge-domain 1106 l2 vfi vc-1 manual vpn id 1106 bridge-domain 1106 neighbor 10.0.11.19 encapsulation mpls ! 
 ​
 The 9006 IOS XR side:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1/0 description vc-1 transceiver permit pid all l2transport ! ! interface Loopback0 ipv4 address 10.0.11.19 255.255.255.255 ! l2vpn bridge group vc-1 bridge-domain vc-1 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1/0 ! vfi 1106 neighbor 10.0.11.28 pw-id 1106 ! ! routed interface BVI1106 ! ! ! ! mpls ldp log neighbor graceful-restart session-protection ! nsr graceful-restart router-id 10.0.11.19 session protection interface BVI28 ! ! 
 ​
 I am not a MPLS expert by any means but it looks like LDP is working:
 Peer LDP Identifier: 10.0.11.28:0 TCP connection: 10.0.11.28:47083 - 10.0.11.19:646 Graceful Restart: Yes (Reconnect Timeout: 120 sec, Recovery: 0 sec) Session Holdtime: 180 sec State: Oper; Msgs sent/rcvd: 199/198; Downstream-Unsolicited Up time: 00:39:26 
 Both sides of the l2 vc are up and have traffic trying to reach each other. I have no idea where I am going wrong at this point.

                              <span>Hello,
 For those of you who rely on a source of truth (SOT) for network automation, how do you ensure that the SOT remains synchronized with the network? There are various methods to achieve this, and I am interested in discussing different approaches and what has worked well versus what hasn&#x27;t.
 I will be deploying Nautobot soon, and once Nautobot is up and running, my next challenge will be to ensure that it is the actual SOT. We have an operations team who make changes regularly to the devices, so this will be a huge problem.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m replacing a Cisco 7606 as the BGP table is getting full. I don&#x27;t have any fancy things running. Just very simple BGP / OSPF.
 I already purchased a Juniper MX204 for the routing. Now I need to have a switch to get me some additional ports as the MX204 only has just a couple (something that was easy on the Cisco 7600 with blades).
 I&#x27;m going the get the switch as refurbish. I just need port density, 48SFP+ and some additional higher speed QSFP). For now I have narrowed it down to:
  
Juniper QFX5100-48S (or even QFX5110-48S)
 Cisco N3K-C3172PQ-XL
 
 Seem to be almost the same. My question does any of either platform going to give me problems regarding licenses? I will not have any license when I buy these boxes. But would like to be able to software update them if needed (assuming I have the software).
 Any other comments on why to choose one over the other?

                              <span>So far in your experience what is the best fibre internet provider you&#x27;ve used?
 I am using Virgin&#x27;s fake Fibre which give&#x27;s us a Gbit but the router they have given us can&#x27;t port forward and the software fix is 2 months away. This is useless since we have servers internal in which we need to port forward.
 We also have a TalkTalk line which we got installed recently. We changed from a Dynamic to a Static IP yesterday but apparently a range of Static IPs are down for TalkTalk atm.
 Is it me or are UK Internet providers getting more and more flaky. 2 Months for a software fix so I can port forward!!! Is a joke. This is the most basic of tasks that routers have been able to do for decades.
 So while our TalkTalk FTTP line is now getting converted back to a dynamic IP so we can at least use it, since the whole line is down. It will then have to be converted back to a Static IP once the issue is resolved probably causing another 24 hour of down time while the IP gets provisioned.
 What are the best UK 1Gbit/Fibre providers you&#x27;ve used? or are currently using?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am wondering how the server knows who to send packets to. Say a discord server or a facebook server. Does the client need to first specify their ip address in some way to the server so the server knows where to send information? And what if I suddenly use a VPN while on the application, how would the server then know to send packets to that VPN server?

 I am comfortable with assigning to the edges but am wondering if it&#x27;s required on the controllers to add features etc or will they operate fine without templates?

                              <span>In our upcoming school, which is low on budget, we want to offer basic security services to any LAN user, and additionally for students, a web filtering an monitoring facility (keyword catching), which could be served by an appliance such as Smoothwall.
 We&#x27;re wondering if we can save some money avoiding the yearly cost of a NGFW license bundled to our next potential firewall (Sonicwall or Fortigate), since some hardening can be implemented through good policies adoption, for instance, implementing restrictions through VLANs, GPOs (Group Policy Objects), and application executions whitelisting, which are effective ways to enhance network security without relying on expensive NGFW licenses.
 VLANs: VLANs can be used to isolate different types of traffic, such as guest traffic or IoT devices, from the rest of the network. By creating separate VLANs for different types of traffic, network administrators can apply different security policies to each VLAN to restrict access to sensitive resources and prevent lateral movement between VLANs.
 GPOs: Group Policy Objects can be used to enforce security policies on Windows endpoints. GPOs can be used to restrict access to specific applications, block USB devices, disable unnecessary services, and enable advanced security features such as Windows Defender Firewall and BitLocker.
 Application executions whitelisting: Application executions whitelisting is a security practice that allows only trusted applications to run on a system, while blocking all other applications. This can be done by creating a whitelist of approved applications and preventing any other applications from running. This can help to prevent the execution of malicious software and limit the attack surface of the system.
 Adopting this strategy, one could achieve the same effect as using an NGFW license, but with a more targeted tool for the education world at the same cost.
 Your thoughts?

                              <span>Connecting my first SAN, a dual-controller NVME unit. Since I have dual controllers for high availability, was considering redundant switches too. But to extend this thought, I would need dual connections from every server (1 to each switch) for storage at least. 
 Question 1: For those running dual controller SAN, how far do you extend the redundancy on the storage network side? Do you have both controllers plugged into the same switch? Separate switches? Are servers plugged into both switches? What about regular network for the servers--is it senseless to have redundancy on storage network but not for regular LAN traffic for the servers?
 Question 2: How important is it to separate SAN traffic from other network traffic? VLANs sufficient or are separate switches recommended?
 Question 3: I assume using redundant switches effectively reduces my performance potential as it cuts link aggregation potential in half. True? Worth it in your opinion? 
 Thanks

                              <span>These are both BT descriptors. My understanding is that Etherway is a physical fibre connection between a customer site and nearest BT node.
 An Etherflow is a virtual circuit on top of Etherway?
 If someone could provide some more background on this, I&#x27;d be appreciative. Or if you could point me towards a relevant resource. Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;m quite new to the field of networking and lately I&#x27;ve been looking into an issue with our AWS VPN when connecting to it from our internal network. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it seems that L3 Roaming is somehow interfering with the VPN. The thing is I&#x27;m a little unsure of what L3 Roaming even does. It seems that it makes me able to move between VLANs, which is not something we do at all. We have some different VLANs depending on what the device is (Native, Guest, Sonos, Security Cameras, etc), and we need these to talk together, but not move from one VLAN to another. With these requirements is L3 roaming necessary? All help is much appreciated!

                              <span>There should be an easy solution to this but as I am no network engineer, here we are.
 I have 16 blade servers in a C7000 Bladesystem chassis. Each blade is identical, with two 10gbe NICs each.
 Each blade has one NIC connected to an external network via a 1GBe switch (slow, but only used for the remote desktop). The second nic is connected to the internal private network with no internet uplink. In the C7000, this is implemented as a physical backplane that allows the interconnect between blades - regardless in the OS this is just a second NIC with no internet access.
 Nic 1 is on 10.66.110.xxx connected to the wider network via the switch. Nic2 is on the private internal network 10.0.0.xxx.
 Currently, if I copy a file from server 1 to server 2, it goes over nic 1 and therefore is throttled to 1GBe by the switch. If I connect from server 2 to server 1 via its internal ip address (ie windows file explorer opened to the network location 10.0.0.1 from server 2) then copy a file to a local directory, it still goes over the nic 1 network via the switch.
 I would obviously love to only have file transfer to occur over the direct connection and get the full 10gbe bandwidth. I should note this is windows server 2019.
 Any help would be appreciated!

 First, I&#x27;ll go back to last September and the first incident. At the first site (that I&#x27;ll call Site A) the old scheduling panels were being swapped out. The on-site tech reported that he had seen most of them come up, but after he finished only 3 or 4 of the 15 panels were on. (I&#x27;m summarizing the important points here, there were other attempts and delays that I don&#x27;t recall all of, and didn&#x27;t lead to a solution, so these are just the important steps.)

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the active exploitation of CVE-2023-27350. This vulnerability occurs in certain versions of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF and enables an unauthenticated actor to execute malicious code remotely without credentials. PaperCut released a patch in March 2023.
According to FBI observed information, malicious actors exploited CVE-2023-27350 beginning in mid-April 2023 and continuing through the present. In early May 2023, also according to FBI information, a group self-identifying as the Bl00dy Ransomware Gang attempted to exploit vulnerable PaperCut servers against the Education Facilities Subsector.

 I planned a few Azure certs this year in addition to going back to school for a bachelors in comp science or cybersecurity.
 My thought is, why should I keep pushing myself if everything is about to be at my fingertips? Also any low skilled person can soon punch in a bunch of prompts and generate required outputs to complete higher level tasks?
 I dont know. I am struggling.

 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name&#x3D;CVE-2023-32233
  
In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled.

                              <span>So I let my boss know in January that I was going to take 8 weeks of paternity leave starting in July. He said no problem and that they would just have to figure out support since I&#x27;m the only tech for my site.
 Fast forward to the last couple weeks. My boss asked if it would be willing to do half the time off and half the time 100 percent remote. I said it wouldn&#x27;t be ideal because It could turn into a lot of me running back into the office so I said I would be willing to help if they were in Jam
 He came back to me this week and said that his boss said absolutely not to working from home and that he expects us to be in the office 5 days a week. 
 Now they are talking about hiring a contractor for when I am out and want me to train them before I leave but the kicker is they want our local operations team to pay for the contrator cost. Which I know they won&#x27;t do because the are on strict hiring freeze. 
 My boss is a very nice guy but this whole situation has made me a little sour. It feels like everytime he talks to me about it you can tell they aren&#x27;t happy about it.
 I stated that 90 percent of our job can be done from home. I just did a whole network and server refresh this year and I stated someone locally should be able to help with troubleshooting over the phone 
 Sorry for the rant. Just don&#x27;t know how to approach this going forward. Considering I&#x27;m entitled to these leave benefits.

                              <span>Worked a couple of years 100% remote, and always produced. Have always produced my whole career. 
 Anyway, we started back in a 3 day per week in office hybrid situation this year. The last couple of months my boss is seemingly micromanaging me as far as &quot;time in seat&quot;. 
 He has commented a couple of times on how I took longer than 15 min on a break or left early (we are talking 10 min once) 
 I&#x27;m on salary I don&#x27;t clock in and out. 
 Just today, I spent 3 hours straight on a call with a colleague fixing a critical issue. After this call, I went to the restroom and then I went 3 min away to the local coffee shop and got a coffee, and then came back. 
 We all get a 15 min break in the morning and one in afternoon. Sure, if you were clock watching I bet it took 20-25 min total this time. But really? This is something that is not really ever cared about, even during this year back, and now just recently it has become a large issue seemingly. 
 Anyone experience this when coming back in or is it a sign that I might be on the way out? My performance has been normal and I always get all projects completed. It just almost seems like they are dealing with something &quot;else&quot; and are pissed off, and trying to take it out on me or something.

                              <span>One year ago today i accepted the offer with my company. In that time, I didn’t know if I was going to survive and make it to this point. 
 I remember feeling like I wasn’t good enough for this role. I remember running into my first issue that I didn’t know how to fix, to which I thought was a major fuck up at the time and turning towards Reddit and this sub for help. At that moment I was welcomed with hella comments that were filled with both help and encouraging words (and the few negative, but they were outweighed by the positive). Shit, even my name “sadmin” was a play on how down bad I was at the time, most people would think it would stand for “system admin” when in reality I named it that with the “S” standing for “sad” (get it? sad-min, sad admin) haha.
 I say this to say, thank you all for the help and advice over the past year, thanks for every post with every new vulnerability, every comment mentioning a fix to an issue, and even every rant that helped solidify the fact that “it’s not just me” lol. All in all, I love and am grateful for this subreddit!

                              <span>So today I was given some exciting news from the CIO...
 I will be moving from my Sys Admin role to a Systems Architect.
 This has been discussed for a few weeks now on and off since I am primarily working on projects that fall under that title as is, but its nice to finally have the title.
 I don&#x27;t have a lot of people in my life to really spread news like this around, so my fellow redditors and admins alike, I choose to share it with yall and my excitement!
 Time to celebrate with lunch!

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

 Have you ran DaaS? Any big downsides I should be aware of from an IT Head perspective?

                              <span>Does you know anyone that has experiacne with setting up kiosk versions of chrome? I&#x27;m trying to create a small script that asks if the production page needs to be displayed in spanish. I&#x27;ve thrown all the flags I can think off and find, but the page still displays in english. 
 Start-Process -FilePath &quot;C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe&quot; -ArgumentList &quot;--kiosk&quot;, &quot; http://serername/APPLICATION/shopfloor.php?terminal&#x3D;$env:COMPUTERNAME&quot;, &quot;--translate&quot;, &quot;--disable-pinch&quot;, &quot;--overscroll-history-navigation&#x3D;0&quot;, &quot;--translate-service-url&#x3D;https://translate.google.com&quot;
 i have also used other flags as well: &quot;--translate-service-url&#x3D;https://translate.google.com&quot; &quot;--lang-es&quot; &quot;--translate-foreign-language&quot;
 This will be part of a solution to minimize hardware requietments for window 10 based systems. Basically turning them into production kiosks while supressing thnormal windows shell.

                              <span>I am in need of a NIST 800-88 erasure software that does not consume licenses. I currently use DBAN, but it does not meet NIST 800-88 Standards. The drives get reused/sold and consumable licenses make that bad business. 
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Crafting this query is hard as results focus on the TTL of records in the DNS server 
 Where does one go to manage the DNS recursive cache?
 The trouble is the delay for discovery of new records that have been added on a site or subdomain for a partner and the time for cache expiration is hard to find or change.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 First post and my native language isn&#x27;t english.
 Since some months we have &quot;problems with cabled(1)&quot; internet &amp; &quot;Wifi(2)&quot; in our enterprise buildings.
  
The problems with cabled internet is solved with disabling Mac Passthrough option in BIOS. Because we use Port replicators that gave issues. (just mentioning this because maybe it helps with the main problem).
 The Wifi problem - Almost no internet at our buildings (250Kbps to 2.5Mbps), when working from home no problem: 
 Only on certain laptops. 
 Working laptop has between 80Mbps-100Mbps
 followed this whole guide: https://www.thetechwire.com/internet-slow-on-one-computer-but-fast-on-another/
 Compared laptop(s) with another laptop and everything is the same(drivers/updates/hardware/... .
 Took the Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 Intern WLAN 2400 Mbit/s from a &quot;working&quot; laptop to a not working laptop. Issue remains.
 Switched the power plan to balanced (i gained 2-3Mbps).
 The Wifi isn&#x27;t REALLY bad at some places. When the faulty laptop connects to AP1 you can have 3.5MBps and when the laptop connects on AP2 it can only have 250Kbps.
 It doesn&#x27;t matter if only 1 laptops is connected to that AP or 10. Issue stays the same.
 We already restarted all the AP&#x27;s(didn&#x27;t replace an AP though).
 When i take a look on our firewall the decibels are for the working and faulty laptop the same.
 We have a Fortinet FortiGate 100F Firewall
 
 
  
-------------
 What i think the problem is: Our firewalls. The problem is that i don&#x27;t know how to pinpoint the cause of the problem. Is there any tool that can push me in the right direction or does someone have some cool tips &amp; tricks?
 ​
 If you have any questions, i&#x27;ll try to anwser them asap.
 Ps: i&#x27;m not an network engineer. I&#x27;m a service desk person.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been quoting up a server today and the price of enterprise SSDs seems to be stuck in a time warp where we&#x27;re still on 2017 SSD prices.
 I&#x27;ve been thinking instead of getting a bare bones HP/Dell server so it can still slot in with the rest of the management environment but putting in our own storage to bring the price down. 
 With this in mind, does anyone sell a PCIE adapter for m.2 drives with some kind of battery backup to protect from sudden power failure? I thought if we paired this up with a couple of third-party enterprise SSD then it would be suitably robust and still come in about 10 grand cheaper.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I work for a small MSP that&#x27;s looking to improve our response to IT security issues and new vulnerabilities so we can patch or mitigate them as soon as possible.
 We are on top of things most of the time, but we have found this is more due to our sys-admins and engineers being properly paranoid and checking various websites and vendor sites on a daily basis, rather than a proper process.
 So how do you guys do it?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been quite smug about maintaining two SBS 2011 systems since 2012, through all &amp; every weirdo issue they&#x27;ve had. Today I was humbled by a loss of DNS into AD in one of the SBS servers, I was going nowhere, into the wee hours.
 So Chattie &amp; I went for it. 
 Question 17 (still no results) the AI threw up an old Server Fault post along with several others.
 https://serverfault.com/questions/566304/dns-event-id-4000-on-sbs-2011
 Chattie: The command nltest /sc_change_pwd: is used to reset the secure channel password between a domain controller and the domain. 
 The secure channel password is used to encrypt all communications between the domain controller and the domain. 
 If the secure channel password becomes out of sync between the domain controller and the domain, then you may experience problems 
 with Active Directory replication, authentication, and other services that rely on Active Directory.
 ​
 UnNamed Fella: We solved this issue by running the following command on our domain server:
 nltest /sc_change_pwd:
 Afterwards we had to restart the server.
 ​
 Chattie: You should replace  with the fully qualified domain name of the domain controller. 
 For example, if the domain controller’s fully qualified domain name is dc1.contoso.com, 
 then you would run the command nltest /sc_change_pwd:dc1.contoso.com.
 ​
 Me: we were both wrong. Here is the results of two attempts - the last just using the domain:
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib-sbs.tcib.local
 I_NetLogonControl failed: Status &#x3D; 1355 0x54b ERROR_NO_SUCH_DOMAIN
 Better: 
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib.local
 Flags: 0
 Connection Status &#x3D; 0 0x0 NERR_Success
 The command completed successfully.
 nltest. I must get that tattooed somewhere . . .
 So, Guestdc if that&#x27;s your name, I&#x27;ve no idea where you pulled that from, but I owe you.
 Thanks.

                              <span>We have 2 esxi hosts one is on version 5.7 the other is on 7.0. I tried following a YouTube video which walks through a command line upgrade after downloading the appropriate upgrade file from VMware support site, but it did not work. Would it be easier to get vcenter and do this? I&#x27;m not sure why they never utilize vcenter before.

Not to mention the time to find, learn, &amp; write these specific scripts (I can&#x27;t find videos or step-by-step tutorials for it). 
 Since help desk job are suppose to be for short-term only, do you think learning to automate is still worth it? Any use of them for sysadmin and network admin?

 For a few days now outlook looses its connection to the exchange server and the only thing that helps is repairing the office installation. 
 Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s in safe mode, cache or online mode. Outlook will refuse to load profiles for anyone on that server and sending mails is not possible.
 Office 2019 is up to date.
 The SaRa tool only works with 365 accounts now so that isn&#x27;t really useful anymore.
 The only configuration change that has been done is enabling mapi and clearing the credentials store/logging in again.
 I&#x27;m out of ideas any help?

                              <span>People think that users are the most annoying to sysadmins but they are wrong. Other sysadmins annoy me the most by far. How do you manage the anger when other &quot;sysadmins&quot; do incompetent stuff like assigning a public ip to a windows 2008 server with firewall disabled because &quot;ping didnt work if firewall is enabled&quot;.....and then they wonder why they got hacked...of course i have to cleanup after them and waste hours of my day instead of doing productive things. By the time they get fired i was annoyed so much im loosing brain cells.

 I work for a small 40 person company in the financial services sector. I&#x27;ve been tasked with providing cyber security training for our users including a phishing campaign.
 I&#x27;m happy to do this myself with a service like GoFish but I think it would be beneficial to test us all, myself included.
 Been looking at services like KnowBe4 that provide a phishing campaign and cyber security training based on the results of the campaign but am wondering if you guys have any recommendations?
 I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some excellent options out there and some terrible ones!
 Thanks

                              <span>Greetings fellow sysadmins.
 When my organisation started with 365, they used their UK entity to register as that&#x27;s how they were doing things at the time. Now the organisation&#x27;s regulatory focus has shifted to the EU and so legal and compliance want our data residency changed from the UK to an EU location, which is perfectly reasonable.
 You can&#x27;t move this by default, but MS had legacy methods for certain customers meeting certain requirements and has recently (October-ish 2022 I think) provided an add-on named Advanced Data Residency which will allow you to change your data residency, and Microsoft will shift your tenant within 12 months. As long as you meet the geographic and licensing requirements, you can just buy the add-on and request it; no need to be a huge org with an EA with MS…</span>

                              <span>Not looking for identity management and integration with HR etc. I can&#x27;t influence that so i just want to influence the account management side i do control.
 We use powershell now and i dont have the time to further develop it, i want to buy/use a mainstream tool.
  
Automate the Exit process in AD. eg once we set expiry, the tools will find expired/disabled accounts in specific OUs and do things like, hidefromaddressbook, remove from groups, change a field or two, move to a specific OU, after 30 days then delete.
 Find users that are more than 90 days since sign in (interactive or non interactive) in Azure AD and expire them. AD Connect will disable them and #1 will action them. I have PS to do the AAD part, so if a tool can run the PS then great. If it aged AADJ Device accounts too even better.
 Reporting and analysis on user account changes. We use Ad Audit from manage engine, but i dont really like ad manager plus. 
 We have simple account creation system working fine, but anything that was out of the box integrated with sharepoint or m365 forms would be interesting.
 Other really handy account management things i havent mentioned.
  
I like adaxes for Number 1. But what does this well on a small (around 2k AD accounts) scale? I can host, i can present a local web interface to admins and helpdesk via RDS.

                              <span>Hi All,
 So I am working for this huge company from India but I&#x27;m based in Europe. Generally, this is the most unorganized place ever, with nothing working properly, legacy technology everywhere, no docu, no escalation matrix, no access to the tools, toxic people... Just a nightmare to be honest. I am spending half of my day fixing the problems that are caused by the company systems set up in the first place. 
 I am now looking to move forward and I am struggling to find a job which is closer to the business but further away from sysadmin / day to day support. I honestly do not want to do it anymore, I enjoy talking to stakeholders and even explaining tech issues to non-tech colleagues and I&#x27;m good at it. I have good soft skills too.
 Which jobs would be good to apply to?

                              <span>Greetings. I am making this post to seek assistance from fellow system administrators that have come across difficulty at getting a job at one point or another in their careers. 
 I worked as a system administrator in the DoD for several years. I still have a clearance. Recently got out several months ago. I am working through a Cybersecurity degree and I have the following certifications: Network+, Security+, CySA+, Server+, Linux+ and Blue Team Level 1. My experience is quite broad, during my time in I was the head system administrator for a 50+ server network of virtualized Windows and Linux servers. There really isn&#x27;t a single thing I am expert level at. The nature of my job required me to dip my toes in SQL, Cisco, Alcatel, Linux, Windows, fiber repair, Active Directory, Exchange, and many other things. Despite several revisions to my resume as well as professional resume reviews, getting a job post military has been very difficult. I have upskilled in the security analyst side of things, getting a decent handle on digital forensics tools and incident handling and investigation through tools like Splunk. I did this to sort of round out my skills and open up the possibility of going a more cyber focused route. But again I find myself at a point in which my skills and experience are super broad. 
 I have applied to hundreds and hundreds of positions. Only received one interview of which I did really well during. They asked very simple sysadmin related questions about DHCP, Exchange, Active Directory. Baby stuff. Yet two weeks later I was told I didn&#x27;t get it. At this point I decided to specialize and get better at Linux. I am not sure what to do really. I know many are struggling with the job market. It has been absolutely demoralizing and at some point my savings are going to run up. I have even applied to numerous jobs below my skill and experience level with no success. I don&#x27;t know what to do.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Firstly - yes, I&#x27;d prefer to do a fresh VM host installation and move relevant VMs over but that&#x27;s likely not feasible. Secondly, our current environment for background is 4 Hyper-V hosts running Server 2012 R2 with each machine running 2 VMs
 So, has anyone done an in-place upgrade of Server 2012 R2 to Server 2019 of a Hyper-V host that&#x27;s running VMs? I appreciate that the relevant VMs will be down for a period during this (if it works) which I&#x27;m cool with as we&#x27;re a Mon-Fri 9-5 business but I&#x27;m more concerned about any pitfalls or issues that could occur during this that I haven&#x27;t thought of (mainly because I&#x27;ve not done it this way before)
 The plan was to shut down the VMs, disable auto start, throw up the 2019 ISO on the host and just follow the prompts for in-place as though it was a standard server (I&#x27;ve done plenty of in-place on the average server). Is there anything that will stop me from doing this? Anything I need to look out for? Anything that I won&#x27;t be able to recover from that&#x27;ll force me to go a different route?

                              <span>Hi. I am the founder of Netdata, the open-source, real-time performance monitoring and troubleshooting tool.
 Today we released a new version of the open-source Netdata, having our new ML-first approach to monitoring!
 Netdata now automatically trains multiple ML models using k-means for each metric collected, at the edge, right at the place where metrics are collected. At the same time, Netdata runs anomaly detection in real-time, while metrics are being collected, and the result is stored in its database together with metric data.
 There is a long story there, because we also managed to do this without increasing the footprint of the data on disk or in memory, we figured out how to optimize and control the ML training resources consumption even when millions of metrics are collected per …</span>

 I have checked this thread but couldn&#x27;t find anything else that seemed helpful. Currently no backups running and the user I&#x27;m running these commands from is a Domain Admin, so permissions shouldn&#x27;t be a problem either. Also checked the Event Log and couldn&#x27;t find any errors. dcdiag /q also returns nothing. Also checked the firewall-logs and don&#x27;t see any dropped connections between the DCs. 
 Is there anything else I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hello,
 Does anyone have any insight on dealing with Hikari&#x27;s connection pooling feature when an application is connecting to an oracle database and there&#x27;s a FW in-between? Initially our Palo Alto FW was discarding packets because of multiple subsequent SYN packets on the same port coming in &amp; the FW was logging it as &quot;TCP-REUSE&quot; . We applied a zone protection profile to help mitigate that discard/reject behavior but there are still I/O erros in the Application logs and I&#x27;m still seeing some aged-out sessions. I don&#x27;t believe it has to do with the way the firewall is configured and when we applied a custom application with a higher timeout value it made things worse..no asymm routing either as there are tcp-fins.95 percent success rate but still errors

                              <span>Wondering if it&#x27;s good practice to use certain IP classes for different places. For instance would it be suitable for me to use a 172.16.0.0 in a small restaraunt?

                              <span>I got a weird network issues on my current setup. I suspect this is related to flow control or bufferbloat or something. (I don&#x27;t have too much knowledge on network)
 The network diagram is here: https://pastebin.com/iENaTizD 
 Text diagram:
  
I have one RB5009 router (one SFP+ connected to the switch; one 2.5G connected to 2.5G AP; one 1G connected to 1G AP; one 1G connected to a 1G interface openspeedtest machine)
 One CRS309 switch. (all SFP+)
 2.5G AP (unifi, can go with 2400Mbps Phy speed, 2.5G interface is connected to the router)
 1G AP (unifi, can go with 876Mbps Phy speed, 1G interface is connected to the router)
 Dell server(10G SFP nic, connected to switch, running openspeedtest, pretty sure the openspeedtest server itself can go beyond 5G/5G at least)
 PC (1G nic, connected to router, running openspeedtest.)
  
The problem:
 Devices connecting to those APs (either 2.5G or 1G) will have full upload speed. But their download speed is always half of the upload. I feel that they might have some issues because of mixed interface speeds on the route. If I run speedtest on the 1G PC server, everything is fine.
 In short:
 10G openspeedtest  2.5G/1G AP (half download, correct upload). 1G openspeedtest  2.5G/1G AP (correct download and upload). 10 G openspeedtest  1G PC (correct download and upload) 
 Does anyone know how to solve this issue? Or any ideas on how to debug this? From the results, does that mean the problem exits on those APs? (since the 1G PC can test correctly to 10G openspeedtest)
 Things I have done:
  
I turned on/off all tx/rx flow control. (including flow control settings in unifi controller) They didn&#x27;t help.
 I heard someone mentioned Mikrotik devices have small buffer. And they said there is no solution to 10G&gt;1G cases. (but why my 1G PC doesn&#x27;t have this issue when testing with 10G server?)
 I have a SFP+toRJ45 on the way. I would like to connect the APs directly to the switch to see if it can be fixed.
  
Thanks!

                              <span>In Ben Piper&#x27;s &quot;CCNP Certification Guide&quot; the author says that the only downside to the routed access topology is that it&#x27;s more complex to configure upfront because you have to &quot;allocate two private IP addresses for each point-to-point routed link...[and] you&#x27;ll need to configure a dynamic routing protocol&quot;
 But it seems to me that if you can only have one switch per vlan then you potentially have wasted switchports and need purchase extra switches.
 Also what&#x27;s the point of using vlans at all since the connect routed interfaces separate the broadcast domain anyway?

                              <span>I work for in big tech more or less as a IT support engineer (jack of all trades master of none). I have been looking to make a transition to something more challenging and rewarded and have been messing around with equipment to get at least some hands on knowledge with some networking concepts.
 However I was wondering for folks that do this professionally how often do you get to tinker with hardware in the field? Looking to advance in a field where I can have a nice mix of working on something hands on and software. Would love to hear your personal experiences.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 just out of curiosity; I had a weird requirement to mirror some (L2) traffic to two devices, I didn&#x27;t think that long about it, said sure and then found out that not a single cisco platform in my dc can mirror to two destinations.
 Nexus:
 ERROR: Eth1/10: Only one destination per session 
 ASR920/IOS-XE:
 % Only one Interface can be configured as monitor destination for this session, hence rejecting the entire request configured under this submode 
 ASR9k/IOS-XR:
 just removes the first one added when commiting.
 some whitebox with ipinfusion/ocnos:
 %% ERROR: xe47: Only one destination per session 
 I even tried some huawei switches we had laying around, but also no.
 Funny enough some old Cisco platforms allow that, but I needed three 10G interfaces, so no. Also I can&#x27;t even say if it works but you can at least configure it on a 2960G:
 monitor session 1 destination interface Gi0/7 - 8 
 I then just used a TAP which i luckily had, and that does work fine, but is this request so obscure?
 ​
 I&#x27;m sure I could have worked around that by either spanning to a pseudowire and letting that drop out on two different ports or with ERSPAN or something.
 Am I missing something? Is this just weird and no one would ever need that? Anyone worked around that problem some other way?
 Thanks!

 Now I have to add some Aruba 6100 CX switches to it, and I just realized that the CX series doesn’t support RSTP. What’s the best (easiest) way to get a config that’s compatible for both ArubaOS types?

                              <span>Looking for a free IPAM with integrated DNS solution for on prem. Looking for the following requriements:
  
Able to keep track of a variety of network data. 
 VLANs
 IPs (ipv4/ipv6)
 VRFs
 Subnets
 
 Supports setting objects as &quot;reserved&quot; but not assigned.
 Supports &quot;grouping&quot; to say &quot;this range of IPs&quot; or &quot;this range of VLANs&quot; 
 Can do ICMP to see if the IPs are still active. 
 Supports integration to a local DNS server. Will build PTR and A/AAAA records as you build IPs. We will then forward requests form our DC&#x27;s to this DNS server.
  
We have tried PHPIPAM. Its ok for what it is but I it has its flaws, and it does not seem like there is much development behind it anymore. Main problem is it does not build A records into the PDNS server while we build entries. 
 Any recommendations?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m facing a weird scenario with a series of Cisco Catalyst 3850, long story short:
 Vlan X, switch A connected to Switch B to Switch C to switch D in a square. STP enabled on the vlan, and each switch is connected to only one other with a trunk with several vlans
 I have one host behind Switch A and one behind Switch C, let&#x27;s call em Ha and Hc respectivelyA-to-D path is blocked on switch D with the port facing switch A in BLK state. Link from B to C is a port channel of 2 members with source mac address hash
 Each switch has a SVI on itself with the same /27 over the vlan X
 If i ping the switches one from each other all is okIf i ping from Ha to Hc i have packet loss (ICMP but also BGP control traffic)
 If i ping from SVI-B to Hc i have 0 packet lossIf i block the A-to-B side with STP port cost, the packet loss vanishes, pinging from Ha to Hc (same for BGP traffic)
 Any idea of what can be the problem? 0 Input errors/CRC on ports.Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 ​
 This might be a bit of a noob question but something I have not done in live environment and we are not big enough to have a lot of test gear and nobody senior has had to do this internally before either. 
 We want to move SVIs from an old Cisco stack of 3750s to new Dell S4048s... I&#x27;ve been trying to test this on an unused vlan but can&#x27;t get the new gateway live on the new stack. 
 Can anyone offer some insight on how to do this safely? There isn&#x27;t much on there except a few legacy VLANs.

                              <span>We have different sites with wireless lan controllers setup in DNA. DNA is in its infancy in our environment but sites and WLCs and some test access points have been setup in it.
 Using Prime we can currently move access points from one site / controller to another. Dead handy for outages / maintenance etc.
 Prime will shortly be decommissioned and I want to do the same thing in DNA.
 When I try i get a combination of the following error messages : 
 &quot; Warning
 Only buildings with wireless profiles can be assigned for AP location. Location , Floor 2, Server Room does not have a profile &quot; 
 AP(s) cannot be assigned to Site(s) Floor 2 . There are no Wireless Controllers in these site(s).
 There are actually WLCs defined in DNA per location.
 From the above it sounds like i need to create a network profile - and if that&#x27;s the solution that&#x27;s fine 
 The thing is access points get all their settings via WLC profile and we&#x27;re ok with that at the moment - we don&#x27;t need DNA to do this. And don&#x27;t want to jump into DNA wireless profiles just yet - unless we absolutely have to !
 We only want DNA to allow us join an access point(s) to a specific controller.
 Any ideas the easiest way to do this

                              <span>We’re currently in a transition period at my workplace where we are wanting to lab test as many of our changes as possible before deploying to prod. A way we are trying to scale this is by running virtual devices in an emulator (EVE-NG) and using them to test the change. To run the whole network in the lab we’d require ~300 devices running concurrently, which presents its own operational problems (and monetary)as we’re essentially running two production networks at the same time. Has anyone gone about doing this before? What are your thoughts on achieving &gt;90% lab testing for every change? Is this a fools game and we should be targeting network simulation instead i.e. Batfish?

                              <span>We have a subdomain which is connected through a ISP-A in CNAME. Through subdomain, a Program runs in a local server with ISP A. If the ISP-A is down, then program doesn&#x27;t run. So we have added ISP-B through router to local server. If ISP-A is down, Local server will pickup ISP-B. Now the real problem is, We have multiple work places. Both ISP runs perfectly at local station. If ISP-A is up and which is connected to C-Name, then issues for other station client or work from home clients. If ISP-A is down and ISP-B is running(which is not connected to C-name), other station clients or work from home clients unable to open to subdomain or run program, Hence we need to change the CNAME to ISP-B to run locally and other stations.
 We have ubuntu server. Can somebody share a solution or an idea to this issue or do need to hire someone to sort?

 Sometimes you may just need some Linux. 
 Just because no one knows it doesn’t mean you can’t learn it. I’ll even write notes how to restart and so on. Just give it a damn shot!

                              <span>Had a weird issue with 3 users on a single PC (same PC, multiple users use it) when opening a couple very old Access .mdb files. Basically they would open them, print a report from them, close the file, then try and open another .mdb file (there are 4 of these) and they would just get a spinning circle of doom and you would have to open task manager and end the task. 
 These files live on a network drive and I tried several things but nothing seemed to permanetly fix the issue. The odd thing was that on any other PC the files works fine for these same users and they never got the spinning circle of death.
 Well I had talked to them and gave them a work around of going into task manager and finding a second Access task and ending that and then the files opened fine, and I got a verbal confirmation from the users that this was good enough so I stopped working on the issue.
 ​
 Fast forward to today where I get a call from their supervisor pissed that this issue is occuring for them and when is it going to be fixed. Yeah, it&#x27;s my fault for not CYOA, but I recalled at that moment that whenever they had this issue the .accdb access files would open fine no matter what.
 So I opened each .mdb in edit mode where I could see all the forms, macros, tables, etc and I just copied all of them and pasted into a new .accdb file and named it the same thing. From what i could tell everything seemed to be working fine. They were not some crazy complex things, just a few tables, forms, queries, and macros.
 I really won&#x27;t know 100% though until end of week, but that should be fine right? There&#x27;s no weird issue in just copying all the tables, forms, etc from a .mdb into a .accdb right?

                              <span>I went on an interview for a system admin position for a fairly large company. They have around 400 windows servers. During the interview he said that it would be my job to manually login to each server and run updates from the wsus and reboot them over a weekend. He said oh, it only takes around 4 hours. Lol. I asked him why sccm isn’t being used or at least gpos to automate it some and stagger reboots? He said why do you think that is an issue? I said, taking time away from your employees weekends when it can be automated. He said, he wants to make sure all systems are running. I said, that’s what monitoring software is for and alerts. And someone can check in the morning. He didn’t like me asking, and I didn’t care. 
 I didn’t want the job anyways after they said the sole system admin would be helping help desk and desktop support when it’s slow instead of researching and improving the environment. IMHO seems this guy didn’t belong being a director of IT. He’s also the security admin and sys admin. 
 Got the email this morning of them turning me down when they acted all gun hoe about wanting me before I said that. Lol. I got offered a job the day before with the city anyways, which I didn’t accept yet till I went to this job to see what they offered.

 I&#x27;m running up against an insane old school senior sysadmin who insists naming servers nonsense names is good for security because it confuses hackers because they don&#x27;t know what the machine does.
 It&#x27;s an absurd emotional argument. 
 Everyone here knows that financeapp-prod-01 is better to use than morphius, but I need some backing beyond my opinion.

Ever since I also read about people’s phones being hijacked by emails containing Calendar Invites embedded in the email. It just really rubs me the wrong way.

                              <span>Hey folks, I’m wondering what y’all use for appliance PCs if you’re building them. I’ve got a couple of applications that won’t run virtualized, so I’m forced to build PCs for them. 
 These are going to be rack mount machines. It seems like finding a 800+ Watt power supply to fit into a 2RU chassis is becoming a struggle. 
 In the past I’ve used Supermicro server mobo and intel CPU. Don’t need anything fancy for GPU and on board GPU works fine. 
 What parts do y’all like when building machines? Thanks.

                              <span>Ppl from team are dropping like flies and tasks are being thrown to me, and I just put in 65 hours last week. This morning I get berated about a ticketless task that I missed a deadline for, even though it wasn’t on top of the priority. I made it clear this particular task wasn’t at the top of my list since there was no clear deadline. I also am trying to interview and land a new job but I won’t be able to start until my consulting contract wraps up in 3 more months(or pay back this years bonus). If I get fired, it looks bad, if I leave I need to pay them back, I just can’t seem to fucking win. What would you do?
 Update: I walked out today thanks everyone!
 Update 2: kidding aside, thank you all for encouraging words. I am going to set my limits and set up meeting with my manager to get a hold of this situation. As for the unpaid overtime, I will likely speak to an employment lawyer. Thanks again.

                              <span>I could use some advice and have been beating my head on a frustrating issue for a few months now.
 We have an AD domain, DC&#x27;s host DNS (AD-integrated, Secure dynamic updates only), a separate Windows DHCP server (configured to run with a DHCP service account per MS recommendations, set to &#x27;Always Register Dynamic DNS&#x27; for clients), and Windows 10 clients.
 Issue is that our laptops have problems with inconsistent DNS A records - their A record won&#x27;t always update to their latest-assigned IP. They move between on-site LAN, WiFi, and a VPN. It seems that back and forth with the VPN is where they get tripped up the most.
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of reading and testing various setups. I believe it really comes down to who owns, and therefore has the permissions needed to update, the DNS record for th…</span>

Its a pretty standard affair but my boss wants to have people who connect to Public Wifi (most commonly would be our salesmen) to have VPN. He wanted me to source another VPN solution like nord/express/ect stating that he doesn&#x27;t think we want them connecting to our vpn just for accessing email. So I have a few questions.
  
How well does a 3rd party vpn play with a work vpn like a sonicwall vpn
 If its just security for when accessing email is 3rd party more secure or would sonicwall be more secure.
 Any vpn recommendations that work well on Apple phones, especially for very non-tech savvy users.

                              <span>Well happy monday everyone, hopefully this issue is localized and not affecting 2012R2 as a whole for those of us unfortunate enough to still be running it.
 Got a call first thing Saturday morning about no internet connectivity at work, so naturally I go in and start taking a look around and come to find out the server hosting our primary DHCP has locked up. It&#x27;s a VM so I just reboot it and now it&#x27;s stuck in a blue screen/reboot loop. Okay whatever, needed an excuse to retire/upgrade that server anyways, and I&#x27;ve got a physical DHCP 2016 server on hot-standby so not too big of an issue.
 Come in this morning and now the issue has spread to our Printing Server and Domain Controller VMs. Print server actually seemed fine with a reboot but the DC got stuck in a boot loop just like DHCP. Also not a big deal since I&#x27;ve got a physical 2022 server that actually serves as the primary DC but still this just seems wild to me that it all happened at once.
 Granted none of this has been a real show-stopper since we&#x27;ve got redundancy but I was just wondering if anyone else had run into 2012R2 suddenly offing itself recently. Or just any other fun monday morning blues.
 I&#x27;ll also update this thread if I figure out anything. Servers seem to be booting when I remove their networking adapters in Hyper-V so that&#x27;s a thing

 -As of the beginning of last week, we have had an absurd amount of tickets come in for &quot;TPM Module Has Malfunctioned&quot;. I am talking hundreds of tickets across our clients.
 -We have not pushed anything out pertaining to TPM, or 365.
 -On all clients, it seems like having them manually sign-out of Office and sign back in fixes the issue, but it is so frequent that this morning, we would usually be at 10 or 15 tickets by this point, we are at 56 with a majority being this TPM error. has anyone else seen this with their clients? I am having trouble finding anything as far as new known issues go for this outside of the tons of articles pertaining to TPM over the last few years.
 ​
 -Has anyone else seen a huge influx of these TPM issues as of the last few weeks?

                              <span>Hello, I am interested in what other orgs are allowing on their Guest Network to WAN firewall rules. We have our guest network segregated by VLAN and it cannot communicated with any other internal networks. However, our Guest to WAN (internet) firewall rule only allows HTTP/HTTPS and a few other web and email related ports. Lately we have had some people complain about certain smart phone apps not working on the guest wifi. After doing some digging I found that some apps require other ports to be allowed in order to fully work. One example is the Sonic Drive-In app, it would not allow you to get to the check out screen. When I did a packet trace it showed port 5671 was blocked. I opened it as a test and now the app works. I have a few other apps with similar connection issues.
 Does anyone just allow Guest to WAN with ANY service allowed? If so, do you consider this safe from a cybersecurity standpoint?

                              <span>This is a bit on the rant side, so please forgive the length.
 Got a client using Barracuda for mail security. All emails from the voicemail service are getting quarantined. Barracuda clearly notes it is an SPF issue, and sure enough when checking it on MXTOOLBOX the SPF record is misconfigured and there are no DKIM or DMARC records associated with that email domain. Client wants to whitelist that address/domain. I hate doing this since hackers always try to spoof email with voicemail subjects, better to do this correctly and safely.
 So I open a ticket and get the VOIP 1st tier, send them the exact error on MXTOOLBOX and tell them to send that to the department that handles your email/dns and correct it. They insist no one else has this issue, and anyway you can just put that address on t…</span>

                              <span>I have 5 new Dell computers I need to get setup for end users. However, the situation is a little unusual so I am looking for advice on what you all would do in this situation. 
 Some important info:
  
The devices are being deployed to a brand-new network (no other end devices)
 We are not using any directory system (AD, Azure, LDAP, etc), and implementing them is out of the question unfortunately. 
 I am aware how annoying this is lol. I have tried to suggest using azure + intune, but was shut down.
 
 I do not have a central server to use, just the 5 devices (one of which is for me to do testing, so really only 4 to deploy to users)
 The devices will eventually need to be CMMC compliant
  
Here is what I need advice on:
  
What is the best way to configure an base image that contains all configuration changes, driver updates, etc? 
 I have looked into NinjaOne RMM, Canonical MaaS, MeshCentral, and MDT. I have used MaaS and MeshCentral before, but most likely these won&#x27;t be approved for me to use. I have never used MDT before and it seems like a lot to get into and I am in somewhat of a time crunch to deploy the machines.
 
 I also will need to get the basic day-to-day applications installed for the users, I&#x27;m not sure if it would be best to bake them into the build, or install them manually on each device after the fact 
 Im new to Windows management, is there a way to install programs with a script? I have heard of chocolatey being similar to Linux package management.
 
  
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting to include something, so I may edit or make a comment. Any help is greatly appreciated.
 Also, in advance to the suggestions to convince my manager to give me some leeway on choosing what tools I use, I have tried and he won&#x27;t budge.

                              <span>Given a list of 2000 public end point hostnames which are responding on port 80, I am looking for a tool that could crunch though them, capture HTTP response code (I made it this far), get the page title, and if the response is a 301 redirect, capture the final URL (to determine whether the redirect was just to an HTTPS endpoint, or whether its redirecting to another site altogether.
 Capturing information about the SSL certificates (if any) would also be helpful (whether their self-signed, issued from our CA, or issued from commercial CA), but not required.
 Ideally this would all be stored in a database so that the same hosts don&#x27;t need to be scanned over and over.
 I started down this rabbit hole with a Laravel app, but once I got to the point of capturing redirects I figured, &quot;you know, maybe this tool already exists&quot;.
 I want a final output that&#x27;s easy to search and summarize.
 ​
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I have a room where the cable internet comes in and houses electrical panels and a large transformer. I noticed a puddle of water on the floor the other day. Looks like it came out of a utility conduit (6-8 inch) that comes out of the cement flooring. Looks like they sealed it with foam insulation previously. We had the cable company look but they said there was no signs of water on the outside. The conclusion is there must be some area in the conduit under the foundation that allowed water to seep in. The suggestion was to rip out the foam insulation and re-seal it rather than trenching into the foundation. Though I don&#x27;t feel foam insulation is going to be watertight. I am also concerned about our cable/internet cables just soaking in water long term. 
 Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Do you have any suggestion or should I not be concerned?

                              <span>I have a customer who in their turn have a customer using MAPI for a custom build app that only supports Outlook 2003. They finally allow me to move them to Exchange 2019, but now they find out this app for this Very Important Customer (like, 80% of their revenue) will no longer work because Exchange 2019 is not friends with Outlook 2003. The original dev (from 2000 or so) left that company, so no one wants to touch it.
  
 The compromise management found is that I will set-up a new 2008R2 DC, a domain on its own, with an Exchange 2010, and a new mail domain, to host the single mailbox necessary for Outlook 2003. Like this the customer&#x27;s Exchange can migrate to 2019 and the customer&#x27;s customer can keep using the app until they found someone to re-write the source in ten years or so.
  
 Sigh.

                              <span>So we&#x27;re setting up an on Prem Exchange Server 2019 deployment for a customer. However our external IP assigned by the ISP is on a black list. Seems to be a running theme for this ISP. 
 Can anyone recommend a paid SMTP relay service that we can use with Exchange?

 I wondered if somebody recognized any changes yet after Broadcom took over? So far all the same for me.

As a part of this project, I am seeking stakeholders who can provide valuable insights and suggestions on the development of the PassVault application.
 If you are interested in providing any feedbacks and suggestions to this project, please feel free to share your suggestions and ideas on what features you would like to see in a password manager application. Your input can help shape the direction of this project and contribute to the development of a secure and user-friendly password manager application.

                              <span>I have a Synology RS3621 and it’s 12-bay expansion unit. I got my hands on 12x 22TB WD RED drives to fill the main unit, but the only 22TB drives I can find right now are Seagate. Would it be a problem if I fill the expansion chassis with Seagate drives? I’m going to be making two volumes - one for the main, a one for the expansion - so no volume will contain mixed drives. All will be either WD or Seagate.
 Would love to know anyone’s thoughts, as I don’t think we’ll be getting WDs anytime soon.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi guys, I hope you can help me out with this one. I need a script or tool that detects file changes or deletion in a specific folder and restores the files by deleting the newly created files and copying the original files over from a backup folder. 
 The reason why I need this is because I&#x27;m running a program that keeps deleting two files and creating two new ones with the same name that keep breaking the whole thing and I am tired to keep copying the two old files back and forth. Before I could just mark the two files as read only with the windows tools which kept them untouched, but as of now since a new update of the program it now deletes the files and makes new ones. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Hi All
 We are a Hybrid/Windows/10 M365 E5 org and have a decent SSO experience for users logging into a device for the first time. We direct users to sign into the OneDrive app first, supply MFA and then all office apps are signed in. 
 What isn’t quite working however is Microsoft Edge. When a user opens Edge (after signing into their office apps as above), there is a message to complete the sign-in. 
 “Work – 
 Not Syncing
 We’ve detected this account on your device and we need to verify it before you can complete sign in, and set up sync.” 
 If you click on the “complete Sign in” button, the user is then signed in with no additional prompt or MFA. We are trying to figure out how we can remove the need for the user to click the Complete Sign in button.
 1 GP we are pushing is:
 Browser sign-in settings - Force users to sign-in to use the browser
 Is anyone else experiencing this or have a workaround?
 Thanks!

 What I want of a system is a ChatGPT like system here you ask it a question like, what services is running on SERVER and what special configuration has been done to it?
 Do you guys know a system like this or are you using something similar to this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try not to make this too long, here is the basic recap of the situation:
 I was hired as the first security engineer for a company with around 300 total users. They have absolutely 0 infrastructure or security tools in the environment currently.
  
All windows machines running windows 10 home
 no active directory
 no endpoint protection
 all machines currently have the same login credentials and each user then logs into office 365 and other apps using their own credentials
  
The infra/security team was recently created when the CTO hired a sysadmin (2 months ago), 1 tech support guy, and myself. I didn&#x27;t really receive any sort of training since well there&#x27;s nothing really to train. I asked the CTO for any diagrams or info about the current setup and she gave a single network diagram with switches and 1 gateway (which we can&#x27;t access - it was setup by a third-party and they didn&#x27;t leave a config file or credentials). I decided to try to use the CIS controls as a base point to suggest security improvements. Basically I wrote a proposal with the help of the new sysadmin saying we should get Windows 10/11 Pro, install AD, and use Defender for endpoint protection (this would required upgrading from O365 business standard to O365 business premium). 
 Long story short, the CTO rejected the proposals saying she&#x27;s not convinced that what we proposed will solve the security issues. She said to focus on security policies and to prepare for ISO certification.
 My question is what the fuck do I do here? Has anyone ever had a CTO who either didn&#x27;t know what AD was or was really against its use? Is there any other way to manage machines remotely that is more cost-efficient? Should I just look for a new job that has more reasonable leadership?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Spent some of my weekend helping colleagues coordinate work to fix an issue which essentially bricks machines and forces hands on to fix and the support from Microsoft boiled down to checks we&#x27;d already been through and provided info on numerous times.
 Eventually by the time it was handed over to India they just pointed us to articles we&#x27;d been through already and asked for logs. Then gave us tools which created 20GB+ log files in the span of 15 mins and said they couldn&#x27;t assist us any further so that ended up getting parked. The actual MS &quot;SME&quot; on the call was mediocre next to a helpdesk tech.
 As part of the analysis/fix we accidentally disabled a setting in Group Policy which effectively broke a lot of app services and caused other issues as it stopped the SOE / IE from being able to call out to the internet properly.
 At no point did the MS techs warn us of this and when we spent a day running through everything to figure out the problem and identified it was issues with the SOE using the PAC we sent more logs to Microsoft who literally just said &quot;yes it looks like you have a problem communicating with the internet we should do a log network trace&quot; and it&#x27;s only after handing over to the EMEA support (which nobody communicated to us, we were just sat waiting a few hours) that we got a good way forward. 
 The only time I&#x27;ve seen (Non MSP) vendor support any worse was dealing with Oracle&#x27;s APAC managers and DBA support.

                              <span>Good morning, I have a small problem. I have a cloud server connected to my local network via VPN where an Oracle database is hosted. The problem arises when I try to perform a &quot;select&quot; query, as it gives me a connection error. As a test, I created the exact same machines, one locally and one in the cloud with VPN, and using the same process, the local machine connects successfully, but the machine with VPN does not.
 Do you have any idea what might be causing this issue? 
 If this post violates any of the server rules because it is a very open-ended question or if it&#x27;s a low-quality post, please let me know so I can delete it.

It&#x27;s still a nightmare in our production system where half dozen of computers are still running Win7 and can&#x27;t print because we patched our printserver. Is there some workaround available for the clients which doesn&#x27;t have Win7 ESU with the vulnerability-patch included?

 ​
 I was recently asked to change the default value for msDS-DeletedObjectLifetime from the default 180 days to 90 days in order to meet compliance regulations. I know that this change will make the value for both msDS-DeletedObjectLifetime &amp; TombStoneLifetime different. I would like to check with you experienced folks if there are any implications if I were to do this. Thanks! :)

 I have a local Postfix server for a app that can not authenticate to MS Exchange online. When sending a lot of messages the app gets an error:
 Error: An error occurred with the following error message: &quot;Server not available, closing transmission channel. The server response was: 4.7.0 Too many messages.&quot;.
 Is there a way to set a higher limit for Postfix to accept more messages?

Both A and B is missing and Default Device Compliance Policy shows error at step of DefaultDeviceCompliancePolicy.RequireDeviceCompliancePolicyAssigned. State details says 65001 (Not Applicable).
 Why does device list show this phone as compliant while it isn’t and how to fix Intunes so this kind of situation doesn’t occur again?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m not the youngest on our team by far, and we are getting more and more work working with GitHub, Terraform and Ansible. I need to catch up and feel in the gaps I have to gain confidence.
 I’ve been looking on Udemy and wondered if anyone can recommend a course that ticked the above for you?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello network wizards,
 I&#x27;m in the process of setting up a Fortinet SD-WAN solution in an environment with three interconnected hubs, linked via dark fiber. At the moment, we have a couple of Cisco Nexus 9000s (N9Ks) managing Data Center Interconnection (DCI) at each hub site, all of them running EIGRP. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I can efficiently advertise the DC networks within the SD-WAN fabric. We have 10 remote sites.
  
Is it advisable to stick with EIGRP, or should I explore transitioning to OSPF or BGP in the context of the new SD-WAN setup?
 
Would it be better to overlay the SD-WAN on top of the current network infrastructure or should I consider a more thorough network redesign to better accommodate the SD-WAN?

                              <span>Thought I&#x27;d come to the collective, am I stupid or is DCNM and VXLAN EVPN BGP just a waste of time and trying to resolve a problem that no one said existed. 
 I have started working at a company where they have DCNM deployed by contractors that are no longer there, they replaced the old nexus 5000 with nexus 9000 and DCNM. 
 We have L2 links to all 4 of our DCs in a ring and always will. Also due to the nature of the company, growth will not equal more DCs.
 We have dedicated Internet pipes at each DC, and an active active firewall pair at the two primary of the 4 DCs. 
 I guess I&#x27;m just struggling to find out what the technical reason for deploying DCNM was, did my previous encombant just get caught in the technical weeds and sold on a null issue by the contractors sales team or am I missing something because I truely don&#x27;t see anything special about this DC that couldn&#x27;t be achieved with a strong switching core, HSRP and some basic routing.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t seem to be able to set ospf costs at all with frr - configs seem to be ok, but neighbor says no cost associated.
 Background: Running Anycast DNS and HTTPS, using quagga on RHEL for OSPF high availability across our data centers, successfully. Looking to upgrade RHEL and therefore moving to FRR. Having some issues with that (a later post), but looking to answer a background question first. Network guys want me to continue using OSPF (vs BGP). I&#x27;m a sysadmin, and only a routing noob. 
 I&#x27;ve largely moved our quagga configurations over to frr test systems. However, I noticed that setting OSPF costs for interfaces (lo loopback) seemed to have no effect. In the quagga config (same lo loopback architecture), changing OSPF cost affects routes (as it should). In the frr config, it does not. The router guys can see the cost changes on their route updates when I change quagga configs. They see no route cost changes when I change the frr config. In fact, they have a cost of 0 for ours no matter what I set ours to (10 total, technically, but that includes their default cost for the hop).
 I would expect my configured cost to be picked up by my neighbor, but it is not (for frr). I assume this is a bug, but maybe it&#x27;s different functionality of frr from quagga regarding loopback? If it&#x27;s a feature, does that imply I must move my OSPF service interfaces from lo?
 More details for clarity:
 Frr system: RHEL9 running frr 8.2.2 provided by Red Hat. However, I also tried frr 8.5.1 directly from FRR. &quot;pallando1&quot; is the system name. I&#x27;ll put the config in a comment.
 Happy to provide additional details as requested. Any ideas?

                              <span>Trying to decide which product to purchase. Looking for some clarification between plans.
 Premium+ says it includes 3,100 labs, premium 1,000 labs, and fundamentals is not specified. What are the differences in the labs? Do all three plans include labs in all four areas of Networking, Cyber Security, Data Science, and Cloud, but just less of each area? Or are each of the plans tailored more towards certain areas over others? For example, I am most interested in networking and cloud. Would Premium be the best value? Premium+ seems to include more focus on cyber security, which I would not be utilizing - not right away at least.
 I appreciate any insight. Thanks.

                              <span>I have three sites connected in a ring topology and I am having trouble figuring out how to get EIGRP to put a feasible successor in the topology. If site A wants to reach site B directly then the successor route is in the topology table and routing table. If site A wants to reach site B through site C then the issue is that the RD is equal the AD and it does not get put into the topology table and I am at the mercy of the algorithm rerunning during a link failure. If I try to manipulate values like delay on certain links then it creates a situation where traffic will go a non-optimized path (i.e. site a to site b would travel through site c). 
 Any advice on how this should be done properly? We are looking to move to OSPF but have not dug through the details there to see if it would be any different.

                              <span>Going to attempt to post a couple questions re upgrading, but the first one is whether the loopback interface is required with FRR for OSPF configurations.
 Background: Running Anycast DNS and HTTPS, using quagga on RHEL for OSPF high availability across our data centers, successfully. Looking to upgrade RHEL and therefore moving to FRR. Having some issues with that (a later post), but looking to answer a background question first. Network guys want me to continue using OSPF (vs BGP). I&#x27;m a sysadmin, and only a routing noob.
 Previous config (simplified) used real ethernet (eth0) for the &quot;server&quot; addresses (.150) and loopback (lo) for the &quot;service&quot; (OSPF) addresses (.130):

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve taken on a mammoth task of building new VMware DVS switches on a clients environment and migrated all vm networking over from the previous cisco aci virtual networking backed dvs. 
 I’ve managed to get it all complete but now it’s time to delete the old dvs and I’m struggling to find info on the correct process to do this. Has anyone been through this before? I can see the vswitch in the APIC gui under the virtual networking tab &gt; vmm integration &gt; VMware. Do I delete this or remove the vcenter within to start with? Or do I start by deleting it from vcenter first? 
 My train of thought is this.
  
Maintenance mode a host at a time and delete the vswitch from the host 
 
once all hosts are removed delete the folder in which the dvs is in
 
open apic and remove the vcenter from the vmm integration 
 
delete the vmm object 
 
 I found this kb to build but nothing to remove https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/4-x/virtualization/Cisco-ACI-Virtualization-Guide-42x/Cisco-ACI-Virtualization-Guide-421_chapter_011.html

                              <span>I&#x27;m a novice (&gt;6 months experience) working in a rural area just looking for direction. 
 Here&#x27;s the scenario: An outside company wants to set up a VPN router in my network for access to cameras and wants me to give them a WAN Interface Static IP Address, Subnet, and Gateway info. I mostly understand what each part is individually, but I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing for them. 
 Is this something to be configured in my firewall? Like am I trying to give them an IP address in there and do something with ACLs to allow them access?
 Or do I need another public IP address from my company&#x27;s ISP?
 Do I need more information from them in order to solve the problem?
 I don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m looking for in order to just google it. Thanks for any help given.

                              <span>I set up Radius on a Netgear Prosafe (M7100-24X) and Telnet+Radius works every time. 
 SSH with Radius is not working, and Access-Requests are NOT seen on the Radius server.
 Here is what I think is the relevant CLI:
 ip ssh server enable aaa authentication login &quot;MyDefaultList&quot; radius local aaa authentication enable &quot;MyDefaultEnableList&quot; none radius accounting mode radius server host auth &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; name &quot;RADSERVER&quot; radius server key auth &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; encrypted MyPSK radius server primary &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; radius server host acct &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; name RADSERVER radius server key acct &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; encrypted MyPSK line telnet login authentication MyDefaultList enable authentication MyDefaultEnableList exit line ssh login authentication MyDefaultList enable authentication MyDefaultEnableList password MyLineSSHPassword encrypted exit 
 Through guessing/testing I found that if I enable OR disable Radius Attribute 4, then I will be able to login successfully with SSH+Radius ONE TIME.
 To reiterate: I enable Attribute 4 and input ANY value:
 SSH 1 : radius packets are seen from Wireshark the Radius server, and login is successful
 SSH 2+ : All attempts fail, and no radius packets are seen from Rad server.
 I Disable Attribute 4
 SSH 1 : radius packets are seen from Wireshark the Radius server, and login is successful
 SSH 2+ : All attempts fail, and no radius packets are seen from Rad server.
 Repeatable indefinitely. Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m sending this because I’m pretty sure most of you have faced a similar issue early on in your careers so I’m hoping to get some guidance. 
 How important is it to have interest or passion within Networking Domain. Especially from an ISP pov, where Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, voice services are huge domains in themselves. 
 Is it important to only look at which domain it’s possible to earn the most money, or if a company fixes a domain to focus on, or to choose whichever domain you’re truly passionate about. Need some guidance on this because I’m at a phase in my career where my organization is planning to fix a specific technology on me to focus on.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>We have dell n2048p switches stacked in our office and every time our yealink phones firmware tries to update the switch kills the port about 30-40% through the process. This occurs if we upgrade via Yealinks servers, our VOIP providers servers or locally through the phones https gui, even on the same subnet as the phone to eliminate the firewall. Our normal configuration is to have an access vlan for pcs and a voip vlan on our user ports, which works as intended. In the logs it shows spanning tree killing the port during the upgrade, however, if I turn spanning tree off on the port in behaves the same way. The only way I can get the upgrade to push through is to change the port to just an access vlan and remove the voice vlan. Has anyone else seen this behavior or have an idea of how to fix it? Changing all of our ports to get a firmware upgrade is not ideal.

                              <span>Hello, 
 So I&#x27;m supporting a plant floor with a harsh environment for most &quot;IT&quot; related equipment. Cold in the winter 30-40 F. Hot in the summer 110-120F air quality is also not great weld dust and other things that are not nice to OT equipment. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has found a &quot;good&quot; solution for an environment such as this? I&#x27;ve ran Cisco, Fortinets, Adtran, few things they all will eventually suffer early failure. 1-3 year life expectancy. 
 Is there a better option? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I am trying to add a VLAN onto a trunk and it keeps appending the native VLAN onto the list change the number. 
 In Trunk mode, currently my native vlan is set to 13 and I have Vlan 50 tagged. I am trying to add VLAN 17 so I type in 17,50. When I hit save it changes the list of tagged VLANs to 50,1317. I can&#x27;t seem to change to this 17, 50. What am I doing it wrong here?

                              <span>I overheard a network engineer vendor we work with describe a proposed topology I didn&#x27;t quite understand. Two distinct networks each with their own respective VLANs would be connected by L3 switches across an MPLS link using only SVIs, so something like a /30 only between the edge switches like so is what I&#x27;m presuming. I tried to do this in PacketTracer but couldn&#x27;t get it to work, so I assume I&#x27;m missing something:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 description SITE2_EDGE_SW-SITE1_EDGE_SW switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 100 ! interface Vlan100 description SITE2_EDGE_SW ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.252 ! interface Vlan10 description PC_VLAN ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0 
 Is it possible to simply route traffic from SITE2 that is destined for VLANS at SITE1 across an SVI like this? Normally I would have done this using a non switchport physical interface that I assigned a /30 ip address to Gi0/1 instead of doing it across L2 trunk, but I could easily be missing something obvious. 
 Is it possible to route traffic from, say, the PC_VLAN in SITE2 on 10.0.10.0 out through Gi0/1 to a SITE1 VLAN on a different subnet like 10.0.100.0 using a L2 trunk?

                              <span>Currently facing a task which looks (and is) extremely simple but I&#x27;m clearly missing out on something.
 Basically I need to filter out of the BGP process *all* the networks with a prefix larger than /24. In the Cisco lab it&#x27;s done by prefix-set and route-policy statements, and the logic is the same.
 I wrote these two lines:
 ip ip-prefix invalid-prefixes index 10 permit 0.0.0.0 0 match-network greater-equal 25 less-equal 32 route-policy test-block-invalid deny node 10 if-match ip-prefix invalid-prefixes 
 then I applied the route-policy to a single peer in the BGP configuration, so again pretty simple:
 bgp XXXXX ipv4-family unicast peer peer-name route-policy test-block-invalid import 
 but when I checked via display bgp routing-table I found that everything from that peer had been filtered out, including the default route.
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thank you

                              <span>I have over 11 years of traditional networking experience (LAN, routing protocols, routers, switches etc.) and have recently switched to telecom networking. Now I am handling cloud-native, 5G, NFV, virtualization, RAN, accelerated cards, K8s etc. I have always liked learning, troubleshooting/creating labs on GNS so learning new stuff isn&#x27;t a problem for me however I am overwhelmed as in where to start from. 10 years of experience seems more like a problem than a help since that level of understanding is expected out of me. Also, seems like we don&#x27;t have as much material (at least structured, IMO) as on traditional networking specially from/on Cisco (which is where I have had major experience in).
 Any recommendations on how make the transition or any resources? I am looking to make a structured plan and go for it. Any sort of career guidance? I would love to connect with someone who has worked in both or is currently working in telco networking.
 I have had people telling me I am insane to come to telecom from traditional networking since there is more scope in the latter which sets me back and messes with my already struggling mind.
 Lastly, this is my 1st post on reddit (which was removed twice, I have no idea why), if I have made some mistakes or not obliged to any rules , please be easy on me.
 Also, would love to connect with people working in Telecom networking. DM me.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am in a process of changing jobs and I am at a crossroad. I wanted to asked you for an opinion, which would you pick and why.
 I have an offer for a mid-level Network Engineer position in the Engineering department at a Investment Bank working with Prisma Palo Alto, Infoblox, migrating infrastructure to Azure and working with Ansible, etc.
 Another option would be SRE in Operations team at a Cloud Company who focuses on multiple cloud solutions but the job would primarily focus on Azure stuff working with Terraform, ARM, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Cloudformation.
 I don&#x27;t want to make my decision with salary or other benefits in mind but want to figure out what would be best for my growth and my career.
 I figure that SRE is more desirable but I am not sure how valuable is working in operations team as supposed to an engineering team.

                              <span>SUMMARY
The Snake implant is considered the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool designed and used by Center 16 of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive targets. To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB’s ultimate targets. Snake’s custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.
We have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australi…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I am 44F. Prior to accident and then pregnancy, I worked for a company that provided ISP (business line) and everything - from my ergonomic desk, chair, three 32&quot; monitors, printers, shredder, VOIP phone. etc. It was an American company and my partner stayed behind and I ended up leaving due to maternity.
 After COVID, leaving the company, pregnancy, moving house and having a new job as well as being classed as disabled by my GP, I was wondering, what people&#x27;s set up are like now. I used to work in the NOC and use Linux as my main laptop, I used to have a sit/stand desk and this is replicated at home, except for the monitor setup. I only have that 3x 32&quot; laptop. Apologies if I am using the wrong terms here as I have had spent 2020-2022 mostly in hospital due to sepsis. I have this special chair/monitor. I am currently just returning to work so quite unsure how my setup at home will be.
 Disabled or not, will you mind sharing your current desk setup to me? I live in the UK and have applied to Access to Work. They have a 5 month waiting time. Regardless of how long it is, I would like to make sure I have ask for the appropriate things and not go over the top. I am wheelchair bound and you can find some of my medical issues here https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/134aah7/is_oral_surgery_the_only_recourse_is_there_any/
 Thank you in advance for all your help.

 Has anyone figurd this out. IT worked great with Windows 10. 
 Is the key to join Azure and connect AD to Azure and have the bitlocker keys stored there vs. in AD?

                              <span>Wondering if anybody has cracked the task that is far more difficult than it should be and found a decent script to correctly display dormant accounts in a 365 tenancy in order to save on licences. We have found a way pulling multiple different reports using a 3rd party tool and trying to automate that with little success so far.
 Trying to be pre-emptive here only, but simply pulling &quot;inactive accounts&quot; like most posts suggest in Azure AD pulls erroneous data, only way we have found is to compare activity reports from multiple sources which is time consuming and harder then it should be.

                              <span>For those of you that have a pretty thorough understanding and access to your environments, how does your OS breakdown for your servers?
 Give rough total amount of servers (primarily virtual, but could be physical too; not including networking equipment like switches/routers/etc), and the breakdown of Windows or Linux or Unix or other.
 If you’re willing to provide the Industry you’re in that would be cool too. 
 I’m just curious as I browse LinkedIn jobs periodically to see what technologies companies use and thought what better forum to post on

                              <span>Hi so dumb question since I guess my knowledgeable wasn’t on par on this
 Situation customer have on premise AD with azure ad connect and a tenant
 We enabled password write back and tested with SSPR and all works
 Most users are uses their synced UPN but doesn’t go on the local AD as their devices are hybrid ad joined, so they are mostly on azure.
 Since their account are sync from in premise when I check either password must be changed at next logon or change the default domain policy to expire after 10 days, no one on azure had been forced to changed their password and their outlook connection never expired
 Is it because the password expire only works on the local ad and not on azure ad?
 Thanks

                              <span>We have this annoying problem. A user signs into their Adobe account using Adobe Reader, which makes Adobe Reader unusable. What happens is that upon launching Adobe Reader, it will continually pop up with Certificate errors and they&#x27;re impossible to click out of. I&#x27;ve tried to sign out, but I get an error in doing so.
 Several months ago, I was able to rid of the error by uninstalling Adobe Reader (64-bit), installing the 32-bit version, then uninstalling that and re-installing the 64-bit version. In doing so, I also cleaned all of the suggested folders.
 Just looking for a quicker way. Does such exist? Are there Group Policies for this which don&#x27;t allow saving user sign-in information?

We are putting together a run book at the org I work for, and I am contemplating how to document our backup strategies. I can certainly write it out, but I also like to make some sort of visual for things like this. 
 Resources we are backing up:
 Wordpress Sites (x16)
 Salesforce (x155 users)
 M365 (50 SharePoint Sites, 100 users, and a handful of shared mailboxes)
 File Server (Synology NAS w/ a few legacy stores)
 ​
 Templates or suggestions much appreciated.

                              <span>Starting to work through benefits and events for my department for the next fiscal period, I&#x27;m curious what are some of the unique benefits other companies offer.
 Last year, I gave all engineering and up a pilot run of the unlimited PTO benefit. This year we made it permanent after both my team satisfaction and organizational IT satisfaction skyrocketed. Most averaged 4 1/2 weeks of PTO, 1 took only a day off and another took 7 weeks off for his son&#x27;s birth.
 Organizationally, we don&#x27;t do WFH but the policy I&#x27;ve with my team is, so long as they are not missing meetings and hitting their deadlines, I don&#x27;t care if they take a day or two during the week to work from home.
 Taking a note from my military experiences and what i saw at another company, I&#x27;ve got approval this year to implement automatic career promotions through a combination of tenure and requiring certifications common at for someone in that role.
 So, what are compelling benefits and events that motivate you?

                              <span>I have been a Sysadmin for a while now. But with every job I’ve had I have ran into weeks of coding new websites with DB queries and using python and just overall programming a lot. A friend of mine offered me a job with a 20% raise to learn on the job and get to work alongside him. 
 I learn quickly on almost anything I do being 24 I have went to from MSP 20% raise-&gt; Regional SysAdmin 40% raise within 3 years. now this programming job seems to be right up my alley. I’m good with the workflow and would never have to touch a printer again! Haha. 
 If you were in my shoes would you do?
 I’m also trying to think of longevity for the career itself. Will sysadmins always be needed once everything moves to cloud or before MSP’s wipe out the lower level items. I’m just not to far versed in whether the career itself is better for the long run. 
 Any ideas would help.

                              <span>One of my sysadmins has been helping to cover while the desktop team is short handed, and this really annoying user who is an angry middle aged woman who got pissed that he moved her cheese and is basically helping do upgrades away from an old system she likes.
 So she accused him of sexual harassment and escalated this. He did not sexually harass her. I know this for multiple reasons. He would never do this because he&#x27;s ultra professional and I doubt he even talked to her about anything other than work.
 But beyond this, he is actually extremely gay (and very guarded about it). He isn&#x27;t into women. At all.
 So she is full of shit.
 This is the sort of bullshit I have to deal with in IT management.
 edit: are people here too young to get the moved my cheese phrase? its a book, a horrible book, google it

 I miss my old IT career of 24 years.
 I don&#x27;t know how to restart. When I had my strokes I was doing desktop and server support as well as migrating hundreds of users to the cloud (email wise - local exchange to office 365).
 Where/how should I start looking? I really wanna get back to my career again and I&#x27;m not too proud to be the guy who brings coffee every morning :)
 Thanks guys/gals!

 Error: Snapshots were found, but they were outside of your allowed context. Try removing them with the backup application which created them. 
 I don&#x27;t have a backup application in use. I&#x27;ve never set up Server Backup on this machine. The only thing I can think of is when I was having issues where snapshots weren&#x27;t able to be deleted on the VM host for this specific VM guest. I read that VMware Tools will use VSS. That issue has been resolved but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s related and not resolved on the guest.

                              <span>Just a reminder, a good job let’s you put family first. 
 My daughter was born at 34 weeks last week. Well before I had planned to take time off. 
 Sure, we had done some pre-planning for this, and I was prioritizing the hell out of a couple projects in the lead up. The only messages I’ve sent to anyone from work since it happened were either HR stuff like getting her added to insurance, and letting my coworkers know everyone is okay. 
 I won’t do another bit of work until September. There was no fuss from my boss. My direct reports were ready to go on taking over what they could. Nothing will catch fire. Nobody is gonna call my personal number. Im on 16 weeks of parental leave. Yes I’m in the US. Companies do exist that are not complete shit. 
 I actually changed jobs looking for a company like this. I asked about paternity leave before I would even take a first interview. I was able to go into this job from the start saying that family came first always. And I have never had a seconds pushback. 
 It’s routine for people to take unschedule WFH days if a kid is not feeling well. IT is actually the most hybrid of teams at the company. (Except the junior desktop support guys, sorry, need someone to swap keyboards when users spill coffee ). 
 I left my old job when I got laughed out of the room for asking for the same 12 weeks they gave women. 
 IT is a fairly small fraction of any company. Makes unionization tricky. But all of us can, when practical for our situations, demand better of employers. Part of that is making sure we get and use benefits we want. Part of that is setting boundaries.

One of the main things I want is to be able to have it print out QR codes to stick on each piece of equipment so it can be scanned in and out. Right now we have an inventory system with the ticketing system we use called happyfox but I can&#x27;t see any feature in that which can generate a qr code to be stuck on the asset.

                              <span>So I manage internal IT for a large company of approx 250 staff. It’s relatively straightforward for me as I’ve been doing this sort of stuff for almost 3 decades now (although I learn something new every day still). But the workload is preventing me doing a few things effectively, so they’re allowing me to hire a 1st line support tech. Their role is going to be building laptops, configuring tablets and mobile devices and maintaining them (AV, updates, via an RMM, that sort of thing), 1st line support, keeping our asset register up-to-date, day to day stuff, and me there to help them, develop them, and give them opportunities.
 I’d really like to hire someone who is “into” tech, can demonstrate an ability to carry out this sort of work on their own ability and initiative, and who doesn’t n…</span>

                              <span>I know it shouldn&#x27;t call it BIOS anymore. The moment I get my hands on it I switch it to UEFI mode. I like UEFI, I know about the security issues but it&#x27;s so much more modern and I just hope the developers can resolve/limit the security risks. (also crossing fingers for an open source UEFI firmware - go coreboot! go!)
 It&#x27;s about the pronunciation: UEFI. These two vocals in the beginning. It&#x27;s killing me, they are so hard to pronounce in a fluid conversation ... so I slip and say: BIOS.
 &quot;We have to make a BIOS update.&quot;
 &quot;Go into the BIOS and see if you can find the setting for ...&quot;
 How do you handle it?
 I thought of using the term &quot;firmware&quot;. But when I say &quot;please make a firmware upgrade&quot; firmware can mean so much: BMC firmware, SSD firmware, CPLD firmware, GPU firmware, ... it&#x27;s confusing. So I slip and say: BIOS.
 I contemplate dropping the U from UEFI and just call it EFI. That would be easy to pronounce and after a while everyone should know what I mean by it. Only Apple admins will get rattled: &quot;You say EFI but then you refer to PC servers, I&#x27;m confused ...&quot;

 However, the SATA PWR Slot inside are 4 very close to each other Pins -&gt; https://i.imgur.com/KBRkFMQ.png and I&#x27;m not sure what kind of cable I need. The full model should be the fujitsu futro s900 g-t44r.

 I work for an MSP and started noticing the issue happening a couple of weeks ago. At first it only affected one customer on one computer, by this point it has affected at least 3 different clients.
 The issue is that Microsoft desktop applications cannot complete the sign-in process properly. It is particularly noticeable in Outlook where autodiscover to https://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml fails.
 Web apps and sign in are unaffected by this issue, it is only happening with the desktop applications.

                              <span>We&#x27;re finally implementing a ticket system at work because I&#x27;m getting some additional manpower in the support department. The plan is to have an e-mail address &quot;support@ourcompany.com&quot; that pumps the tickets into the ticketing system (osTicket) and only accepts mail from us to prevent other people from creating random tickets.
 The support of our mail hoster said we could create rules for this using the Sieve language. I&#x27;ve tried multiple variations that should imo get this done, but it&#x27;s not working.
 Current version of the script:
 if address :contains :domain &quot;from&quot; [&quot;ourcompany.com&quot;, &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot;, &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot;] { keep; stop; } else { discard; } 
 I&#x27;ve tried with :matches :domain and with :contains :all but sending test mail from an outlook.com address still lets through the e-mail. I also tried with if not address ... discard; but that yields the same, unsatisfying, result.
 Has anyone run into this before?
 Edit: I accomplished what I wanted to do, even if not in the exact way I&#x27;d have liked.
 I created two ticket filters in osTicket to do this. I need two filters because if I only apply the second filter, all e-mail gets rejected for some reason and no tickets are created.
 Filter 1: &quot;E-Mail accept&quot; 
 Priority: 1 Stop execution on filter match: Yes Filter any of criteria: User Email contains &quot;ourcompany.com&quot; User Email contains &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot; User Email contains &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot; Do: Set help topic to &quot;Support&quot; 
 Filter 2: &quot;E-Mail reject&quot;
 Priority: 2 Stop execution on filter match: No Filter any of criteria: User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany.com&quot; User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot; User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot; Do: Disable notification on new ticket Discard ticket

 Basically, Teams calls are lagging/stuttering/freezing when users are connected to office LAN. There doesn’t seem to be an obvious pattern to this - it can happen when on a call with a small number of people and also large. It will happen with both audio and video calls. It’s random, happening for all users, even when connected to the office WiFi. 
 Users working remotely don’t experience this problem. We can have people outside the office on the same call as those in the office, and only those in the office get this issue (affects everyone on the call in the office at same time).

                              <span>Casually browsing the internet for some free antivirus for my personal computer and found a comodo product called &quot;OpenEDR&quot; that claims open source edr.
 Tried and just amazed all function is just like a commercial edr solution.
 But I don&#x27;t think a &quot;opensource&quot; edr can really deployed into corporate environment. Furthermore the portal is just managed service.
 Does anyone have tried/deployed OpenEDR in their environment?

 This year I will hit 10 years as being in IT/network engineer. I&#x27;m at my 4th position in the industry (3rd company). West coast/HCOL/mid 30s. I originally got into being a network engineer after my mentor who I met at my first help desk role said I should learn Cisco. I got the CCNA and switched to jr neteng role and I really liked it. After 2 moves, I now hold a sr network eng position for an electronics retailer. The position is nice, good pay, boss is laid back, its just me, my boss and 1 other guy on the network side. Have about 200 locations and 3 Colo POP/DCs. Got a few certs: sec+, CWNA, couple of CCNPs. I like the position but I feel I could get more pay and/or take on more challenging net…</span>

                              <span>I’m essentially an IT consultant, and the place I stay in Zimbabwe has awful internet. They currently have 25mbps for 12 rooms, and right now I’m getting into UniFi networking so I’m getting more involved with this space for them.
 The whole place is concrete and there are no access points except two, one in a room at the end of an L block and one in a kitchen that is where the L meets. They will never install ACs in every room (and they change the configuration of the rooms almost every time I come back, it’s a Zimbabwean thing).
 So, the internet gets so bad that we can’t even load websites, and while I know they could be doing stuff to help, they’re thinking simply upping from 25 to like 40mbps would do the trick. So I have to ask, how does one determine what is the right amount to purchase? Or is 25mbps actually fine and the bad speeds are only due to the poor planning on their ACs?

                              <span>I am working on a project that uses a spool of ethernet cable on a modified hose reel which can be wound in and out. One end is connected to a device which reads gas composition and dropped down a hole about 100 feet. The other end is plugged into my laptop where I can view live readings. This connection must be made and the device turned on manually at the surface, before it is dropped, so I cannot unplug the connection to the laptop at any time. 
 The problem I have is that while the cable is being unwound and the device lowered down the hole, the cable end going to my laptop is simultaneously spinning/twisting up. If it drops 100 feet, there&#x27;s suddenly 70 or so windings in my 6 ft of ethernet cable between the laptop and the spool of cable. 
 Can you think of any solution to this? I essentially hand wind/spin the cable in the opposite direction 50 times or so every time I connect to the spool so it minimizes the problem but I am looking for an elegant solution. Perhaps some kind of preload spring/spool that keeps it wound in the opposite direction or a special highly-rotatable cable or something. Any ideas would be appreciated! 
 Also, any ideas for a powered winch which holds 200 ft of cat7? I&#x27;ve been looking at anchor winches but they only seem to hold 100 ft of .20 rope. Also looking at modifying a harbour freight winch, but I need to solve this current problem of the cable twisting first.

 I have aruba central with 3 aruba access points in my office.
 The aruba central is configured with ceritifcates for login to the primary ssid.
 I have a guest ssid as well that people can connect to it using just a password.
 I want to know if i can use this device for extending the strength of the wifi so people could use this &quot;home device&quot; extender ( just for the guest ssid that is being used for connecting with a password)

                              <span>Hello r/networking!
 We’re in the process of setting up our network in a small environment (under 100 employees). 2x firewalls, 2x core switches, 2x edge switches, and 2x DC switches. Basically, the essentials.
 We want to grow this tiny plant, provide enough sunlight and water it daily in order to reach the heavens, and its roots heavily planted. In other words, an anti-fragile beast that can stand the test of time.
 To achieve that, we obviously have to follow some steps. Solid configurations, backup policies, physical security, insightful monitoring… etc.
 There’s one big issues, though. I don’t know where to start. I’m capable of learning nonetheless. 
 So, my questions (and humble requests) to you, esteemed network engineers, what are some resources I can use to build a strong base for our network? I.e. best practices.
 What are the must have’s, and the good to have’s? Should we just buy every buzzword solution that are out there, or just stick with the essentials and call it a day? But what we can call essential and what we can call superficial? For example, is a NAC solution a must have? What about an IPAM?
 Again, I’m reaching out to the ocean of knowledge that’s you hoping for an answer (or an advice) to some, if not all, of my questions. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all,
 Certificate management is one of my weaknesses. Our domain root CA needs to be renewed shortly. Can this be managed in a cloud based environment (e.g. Azure)? Currently we have a dedicated server for our root CA and another for a CA. If this can be managed in a cloud environment without dedicated virtual machines, that would be great.
 Thanks

                              <span>Currently I use an encrypted password file (Some powershell password module) to run my automated scripts on our tools server. If we change the password for that service account, I have to change the file (not a huge deal) but I would like to find a way for this to be autonomous. In that the password rotates every 3 months or so and instead of there being an encrypted file on the server, it reaches out to say Azure Keyvault or something (This is where my ignorance shows).
 ​
 I know there is Jenkins, Github CI etc but not sure where to start. Was hearing good things about Github CI.
 ​
 Would also like to rotate the service account passwords for accounts that run flows (they have premium licenses on them)
 ​
 Only thing here is that changing the password breaks the flows as the connections need to be rebuilt with the current password. Is there a way to have them reach out to key vault or something similiar instead?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in IT at the same (small) company for nearly 2 decades. My technical title was sysadmin but it was everything from device deployment/management to end-user support to enterprise networking to you name it. It truly is a thankless job but I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, loved my co-workers, and made decent money.
 I have accepted a new job which I start Monday doing cloud architecture for clients. No more end-users, no more printers, no more on-call, 100% remote, and most importantly a 50% RAISE (plus 10% yearly bonus)! Not to mention paid certifications in everything Azure and AWS. And if I have an IT problem I get to be the end-user and call the helpdesk, lol. 
 Is this it? Did I finally make the big time?! It all feels kinda surreal...
 EDIT: I didn&#x27;t expect this to blow up like it did. Sorry if I haven&#x27;t responded to you. I&#x27;m about to head to bed but I&#x27;ll try to get to everyone tomorrow. Thanks for all the well wishes!

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone has any experience with software that can provide certificates to clients similar to SecureW2 but perhaps via FLOSS like OpenSSL. I know this can be done with Microsoft Intune as well but that seems to focus on managed devices like company assets. I am wondering about something that can be used for devices not in the control of the enterprise but that are used on their Wifi infrastructure (like students at a campus for instance). I think getting the certificate is not difficult however the missing piece seems to be with how to easily get the certificate installed and the wifi network configured to use it for EAP-TLS. There are many client types (Windows, OSX, Android, etc) so it would have to work across a breadth of devices. Any direction would be appreciated.

                              <span>Granted I am relatively new to being a salaried employee. I got my first salaried position a year ago and have now had two. It always felt kinda like a scam unless the company would also very open about &quot;If your work is done just go home/log off&quot;. If they expect me to be available 40 hours then I&#x27;m doing 40 and not a second more.
 I work to support the rest of my life and reach my financial goals. The position I have now I took because it paid the most of all of my offers. Why would I work for free, essentially reducing my salary per hour?

 When I&#x27;ve written COM API integrations in PowerShell too, the corresponding Microsoft documentation pages have no code examples so you have to play around / use SO.

They seemed genuine, what with giving me my email address over the phone, but once I got WD’s mail, I knew what was going on. 
 They all asked if they could email me something, so it seemed like they’re just building a database. Expect more targeted spam or spearphishing.

                              <span>I’m a Helpdesk manager who has been in tech for 5.5 years, supervisor for 2 and manager for 1 of those years. Worked for a global international corporation for 4 of those 5 years. I really can’t see myself working for another MSP again and I would love to specialise in something else. Thinking maybe devops or cloud admin but the problem is that I don’t have any experience in these fields. A lot of my technical skills are for very specific out of date technologies which no one uses anymore. Helpdesk was fun but I feel like I’ve lost interest in this field and I’m dreaming of something bigger and better. I would have absolutely loved to be CTO one day but with this setback and my age of 35 I feel like that’s a dream which is fading. If there’s any silver lining, the redundancy package is pretty good so I have a good several months to live off without being desperate so I could upskill. I genuinely feel like I’ve ruined my career by being so focused on getting promoted in a Helpdesk which is so irrelevant. Any advice or if anyone who has been in this situation before could shed some light would be very much appreciated.

Depending on what service/tool they are asking access to, an email goes to their manager or the service owner. Once they approve it, the user gets added to the AD group. 
 Is there any third party alternative that we can use to simplify this process? Any tool or something that you guys are using to handle such requests.

                              <span>Hi to the folks at r/sysadmin, I would like some advice on a few subjects:
 ​
  
For quite some time, the team was trying to find a resiliency solution for some of the software that is used in the company. The software is monolithic &amp; can&#x27;t run in multiple instances. So, we&#x27;re forced to deploy new hardware to each location. My idea would&#x27;ve been to consolidate all of the hardware onto a pair of powerful servers (one located at our offices, the other one off-site) and virtualize all 100+ machines onto these servers – that way, if one of these VM servers were to fall over, the team would be able to rapidly spin up a new server &amp; get the branch up and running very quickly (15 minutes max). this idea got shot down. 
 
We use a mix of local AD, Google Workspace &amp; M365 as our environment. I&#x27;ve been trying to convince both my team lead (who&#x27;s the IT manager) and boss (the CIO/CTO) to try and unify everything under one vendor for ease of deployment, management &amp; troubleshooting for the long term – once again, the idea got shot down. 
 
All our infrastructure is not managed by any form of MDM, I pitched this idea, and it got promptly shot down. 
 
 I really like the current workplace, but trying to convince them to change/rebuild the current infrastructure for the better, just results in resistance from them. I’ve tried to talk to them to see why they are resisting change/shooting down any ideas. the only reasons that I got from the CIO/CTO was that it&#x27;s due to financial &amp; &quot;if it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it&quot; reasons. So far, I’ve been unsuccessful in trying to get *any* ideas to stick.
 Any advice on how to approach this?
 (P.S. this is my 2nd proper job as I had to leave the 1st one due to health reasons. Also, excuse the weird formatting; LibreOffice &amp; Reddit&#x27;s new UX don&#x27;t like each other a bit)

                              <span>Are there any places considered &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; when it comes to working in IT? Places that are generally considered a last resort to people so to say? I&#x27;ve always considered schools as a bottom of the barrel, however, i have no reason to think that. I also view MSPs as that, because I hear a lot of horror stories from there.
 I&#x27;m aware this is probably personal opinion but just seeing what everybody else thinks

 Fully remote org. I’m implementing an internal IT function. There are several users popping in requests for Google accounts for collaborating with other orgs that are using Google. Most of them have been creating personal gmail accounts.
 At my previous gig we were a Google shop and needed Microsoft 365 for some folks. We had onprem AD and were able to sync logins across all platforms. Am I crazy for thinking we can do the reverse in this case? We have azure ad instead of onprem. I would imagine I can disable gmail and restrict Google drive to make sure we maintain data governance, but that is all conjecture at this point as I’ve never done it before.
 Any thoughts from people who have done it before? Will disabling gmail totally break other apps? I’m probably missing a lot but open to suggestions. My team thinks we should investigate the use cases more as there’s a perception we don’t really need Google accounts to collaborate like this. They may be right but it could end up being more work trying to walk multiple external orgs through proper sharing processes so we can work with them.

 Suit guy within earshot: &quot;What&#x27;s going on, there&#x27;s a problem with the server?&quot;
 Me: &quot;yeah, it&#x27;s just really slow, see look.&quot;
 Suit: &quot;Is this our production server?&quot;
 No, it&#x27;s Dev.
 But we do work on Dev, correct?
 Uh, yeah, people use it if that&#x27;s what you mean.
 Whatever is causing it to malfunction, I want this fixed immediately. Today.
 I&#x27;m kind of slammed today, probably Monday looking better.
 Listen to me, I cannot afford delays on my project, whatever else you are working on can wait.
 Yeah, definitely, I&#x27;ll make sure it&#x27;s fixed today. Suit walks away. *Reboots server*
 Later that day: Hey Steve, I got that server fixed man, just had to toggle the RAM allocation to CPU cache, and run the bitwise script on the hard drive. Thing is running like new again.
 Okay sounds good, have a good weekend.

                              <span>Hey everyone. 
 I work as a system admin and ERP Administrator, I also serve as the technical lead for the team. Our company is looking to bring in some new hires to fill vacant positions. 
 I&#x27;m still notably green, as I&#x27;ve only been in this position for ~2 years. The positions we&#x27;re hiring for will likely require assistance with learning skillsets that either I have just started learning, or will have to learn with them. 
 Additionally, I&#x27;ve never had reporting employees that I&#x27;ve had to train before. 
 Could you please share any advice/resources you have on training new hires? What has worked for you, what hasn&#x27;t?
 Viewpoints from the eyes of the trainee are appreciated too!
 Thank you :)

                              <span>I think the answer to this is going to be &quot;no&quot;, but before I declare defeat I wanted to run this past everyone to see if you have any ideas. Here&#x27;s the situation:
  
The platform is M365 / Exchange Online.
 Currently, a number of teams share a generic user mailbox.
 If a user needs the mailbox on a mobile device, they currently just have the user mailbox added as the only mailbox.
 This situation is historic from many years ago.
 Compliance requirements are now forcing the organisation to ensure all users authenticate with unique credentials. It&#x27;s obviously also a good idea from a general infosec perspective and will ensure M365 licensing is correct, so it&#x27;s helpful that compliance is finally forcing the change.
  
To achieve this, we will create each user an AAD account with a license app…</span>

                              <span>How would it be best to detect theft of computer components in a hotel room? You can do secure case and bolt it down but that&#x27;s just deterent at the end of the day. When the computer is on we should be able to detect the components and should be able to script something to detect this on startup and/or periodically but just thinking if there&#x27;s anything else that could be done to help prevent/detect theft?

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I have short question. we have 300+ zones in our DNS environment. If I set the TTL time to 5 minutes will there be any negative impact on DNS Server?
 is it likely that the 5 minute TTL is being ignored outright, because of fast flux countermeasures?
 ​
 thanks in advance,

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve recently been bought out of a permanent contract and I&#x27;m scouting the market for a good next job. Turning on the LinkedIn &quot;open to work&quot; setting flooded my DM&#x27;s with recruiters looking for their next finders fee. Needless to say I&#x27;ve spoken with quite a few and some have been helpful and others talk about themselves for 40 minutes and tell you that they&#x27;ve never hear of an MSP before.
 What are your surreal recruiter conversations you&#x27;ve had in these cramped markets?

                              <span>I just accepted a position with a company a 4.5 hour drive away. I start Monday. They just sent me the benefits information and I just discovered that there are no in-network doctors where I live. That means I&#x27;ll have to pay a co-pay for everything, even an annual physical, and if I ever need a prescription, need to see a specialist, or have an emergency, that will likely wipe out all of the raise I&#x27;m getting by taking this job as well as money I&#x27;m saving by not commuting.
 For any non-Americans trying to parse the above paragraph: yes, our health system is as fucked up as you&#x27;ve heard. If you ever have a politician in your country suggest changing your health system to be more like ours, hang them from the nearest tree.
 So what else did &quot;they&quot; not tell me about working remotely?

 We are looking to set Ecosia as our default search engine for the user base, and although I have added it to the list of search engines using Group Policy I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to set the &quot;Search engine used in the address bar&quot; option, it never changes from Bing. Is there a specific policy or registry key I&#x27;ve missed for this? I&#x27;d have thought it would be simple!
 Thanks.

 I don&#x27;t know which NAS yet but I mean enterprise like say NetApp rather than Synology/QNAP/FreeNAS type stuff. 
 I know there isn&#x27;t a right answer to this so I&#x27;m interested why you&#x27;d go in either direction.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made a few purchases of drives directly from Western Digital. Someone here pointed out that their online store and RMA systems were off-line for several days, presumably because of a ransomware incident. Their e-Commerce site has been off-line for 6 weeks .
 I just received an email from WDC notifying me of an &quot;incident&quot; involving their on-line store. My purchase data has been compromised.
 ​
  
The information included customer names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers. As a security measure, the relevant database stored, in encrypted format, hashed passwords (which were salted) and partial credit card numbers.
  
No word on how this happened, but I think the working assumption is that a WDC employee opened an infected file that allowed the ransomware to run through their systems.
 WDC provides these &quot;helpful tips&quot; to people whose data was compromised:
 ​
  
As a precautionary measure, you can take the following steps to help protect your personal information from potential misuse: 
 + Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information. 
 + Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. 
 + Check whether your email account has spam settings to help you detect or block suspicious emails. 
 We hope this information is useful to you
  
​
 Gee, thanks, WDC. You do the same, M-Kay?

 Has the record gone stale? Should I add the DNS information again? Is namecheap just incredibly slow with dns caching even with the TTL set to 5 minutes?

                              <span>I work at a mid size non profit and we use an IT vendor to manage our network and computers. We have a mix of ITaaS and HaaS agreements with them but I’m looking to purchase more equipment elsewhere when needed because it’s often much cheaper and I’d rather us own the equipment and not get locked into rental agreements. 
 We’re opening a new office and now I find out they will not let us purchase a firewall. We have to rent one from them in a 5 year agreement that’s about twice the price than if I purchased elsewhere. They say it’s because they lump in the IT management fee for the firewall in the rental price. 
 Is this reasonable or common practice? I don’t see why we can just buy a firewall and pay them a management fee. 
 Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;ve asked this question before on other subs, but none have been able to figure it out.
 I have two fairly old Macs desktops, running windows, and I&#x27;m trying to wipe everything and just use Linux (Ubuntu).
 I&#x27;m struggling with getting them to boot from USB. I&#x27;ve tried ventoy (not supported on Macs), and making a bootable USB through Linux mints&#x27; standard &quot;make a bootable USB&quot; option. Both give me &quot;secure boot 14&quot; error. But googling that gives we information about windows?
 At this point I just want to nuke the machines, wipe everything and just have Ubuntu. I don&#x27;t care about the windows partition because it runs too slow to be of any use anyway. There is no important data on them as the owners have resorted to just using their laptops.
 One machine has only windows on it, and it was still stuck at the splash screen after leaving it overnight. The other has a working windows OS on it - this is the main one I&#x27;m trying to save. Both throw up the same &quot;secure boot 14&quot; error.
 And to top it all off, they&#x27;re all using Chinese language operating systems. So I&#x27;m reliant on Google translate from my phone to figure stuff out.
 Just for laughs: one of the business owners suggested solving the problem by buying a third Mac, and putting windows on it. Before throwing the keyboard at them (metaphorically speaking), I enquired as to why they:
 1) didn&#x27;t just use Mac OS in the first place because they just use it for excel, word, and Photoshop 2) didn&#x27;t use a windows based machine 3) thought that buying a third Mac would solve the problem
 They don&#x27;t know how to use Mac OS; Macs look nicer; a new Mac would be faster.

                              <span>We were looking at the potential use case of having Active Directory Cloud Sync through the Microsoft Azure P1 plan but changed our minds after checking out the annual cost per user. We prefer to go a different route which is: 
 1) Having a cloud Active Directory server privately hosted, either in GCP, AWS, or some other cloud instance provider.
 2) On premise AD server connect to Cloud AD
 3) Google Workspace synchronization with our Cloud ADWe want the workflow to be - having the Private AD Cloud server, communicating only to two destinations, the on-premise AD server(s), and Google Workspace for LDAP synchronization which will be used for the overall user and password management using Google Workspace as the MFA service and SSO identity.
  
What is the feasibility of having this solution?
  What challenges should we expect? 
 What security precautions should we take for the Cloud AD? 
 Should we add a dedicated WAF to prevent intrustion and DDOS attacks? 
  
Any help would be appreciated, thanks

                              <span>I currently find that I spend most of my day responding to trouble tickets re: networking lately.
 1st step in the process is to to request a bidirectional MTR from the problem to the problem.
 Been thinking of how to expedite this process. Thought of making a video, &quot;How to run a bidirectional MTR&quot; but seems like there are a thousand already... Then thought, I should make a website that you put in the start and end ips of the route to test, and it runs the mtr for you and gives you the results...but there seem to be many of those as well. What tools does anyone here use? There has to be faster way, I spend half my time requesting an mtr, the other half explaining what it is and how to generate one...Any tips appreciated.

                              <span>Right now, we have a mixture of cat5e and cat6 running throughout the building (added over the years). During the last big addition, we tried to future proof, but now we are moving the server room so we are re-wiring. We are an entertainment facility. About 60% of our network bandwith is multicast traffic as all of our projectors/tvs get the data from a few VM&#x27;s powered by Proxmox as well as HDMI to RTSP encoders. By the end of the summer, we are increasing the number of TVs/projectors from 23 to about 35-37, while also increasing our in-house tv channels that are being broadcast from our proxmox servers. Right now, all the content (other than Comcast) is being fed from our Synology server). I am worried about that being a bottleneck as it may need to feed 10 1080p/4k files continuously to each VMs to be broadcast... Our Synology is also our file server and at times it is definitely slow. (I can&#x27;t add a cache drive to it)
 If I decide to go 10gig, then I will also be spec&#x27;ing out another server with some SSD&#x27;s in it or at least able to add some SSD cache..
 If I decide to not go 10gig, I will still be looking to get a bigger NAS. Just not sure which way to go...
 Also currently, it is 8:30pm on Saturday night and we have 235 devices connected to our network.. (Our high is about 430 devices).

                              <span>Need some help here with understanding Unifi’s guest captive portal capabilities. The documentation I’ve been able to find is rubbish and I don’t have a Unifi network to test on… not a great start. 
  
Can it do T&amp;Cs + Email authentication (no password, just collecting email for marketing purposes)?
 If not, is there a list somewhere of supported third party hotspots, or is it possible to DIY one?
 Can the captive portal operate without a controller (i.e run on an AP) or can it run using the cloud controller, or do you have to have a dream machine/physical controller on-prem?
  
Unifi wouldn’t be my first choice, so if anyone has thoughts on cheap-ish no controller access points that can serve a decent captive portal, (commercial solution, not openwrt etc) would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have a general question about the vm live migration implementation. Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask.
 It&#x27;s more or less clear to me how the VM can be live migrated from one physical host to another by copying and then syncing disk / RAM as well as state of VM&#x27;s NIC and other &quot;hardware&quot;.
 However, between the client and host there is a non-trivial number of stateful networking equipment. Once you move the VM to another host, new network route will involve different equipment which is unaware of the preexisting connections.
 How is it achieved that existing TCP connections to the VM are preserved without an interruption? Are there scholarly articles that explore approaches of proprietary vendors such as vMotion in detail?

                              <span>I am a little confused with the segmentation of voice data. 
 I learned that you would want to segment VoIP traffic from Client Data traffic and that you can daisy chain a desk-phone to a PC and configure VLAN and Voice VLAN on the switch. 
 We have Cisco MS Merakis at work. 
 How do i segment voice traffic if we implement soft phones running on the clients?
 Through the VLAN and Voice VLAN setting? 
 My idea is that i could enable port isolation on the Switches if i cant segment VoIP and data traffic. That way no other Client should be able to sniff their packages am i right? 
 Thanks in advance
 (pls ignore typos)

                              <span>Hello!
 I need to get ip adresses of a domain to do some traffic filtering. How to approach the case of updating the ip adreesses after expiration such that the rule which filters the traffic to still be applied?
 For example, dig +short www.google.com gives me an ip address. Is TTL field the time after the IP address is changed and I should get the ip again?
 My thinking is to do a cronjob which is running every TTL seconds and writes ip adresses in a file, then I compare the current result with the adresses from that file. If the adresses are changed it means the ips were changed. Is my approach correct?

 I&#x27;m testing Ubiquiti UAP-AC-M-PRO (commercial) and Huawey 5731R-11E (enterprise) with external omni antenna.
 During a test the coverage at 2.4 and 5GHz is the same. I&#x27;m not an expert and I don&#x27;t see the difference.
 I&#x27;ve seen the supported users for every radio is very different, the configuration is more detailed in the Huawei interface.
 Can I&#x27;ve your opinion?
 My best regards

My boss the CIO started only 6 months before me, and my position was newly created. I have 4 full time staff working for me, 3 young helpdesk people, and one systems/network engineer. Plus a number of consultants and MSP&#x27;s we work with for various things. The workload is very, very high and demanding, but I&#x27;m used to that sort of thing. There is a great deal of end-user related support, but also a fair amount of enterprise networking and on-prem data center stuff (server room), nothin…</span>

                              <span>Have a few Hyper-V and each hosts 50+ VMs.
 Occasionally, need to reboot some VMs manually. Current setup is through the RMM software installed on Hyper-V host: staff on allowed list send an email with title like &quot;reboot vm 120&quot; to an internal email, then a powerautome kicks in, sends an api request to rmm server, rmm server then send a job to a rmm agent that executes a reboot.
 This process works well, but it is a bit slow. Often takes about 10 - 15 minutes.
 How to make it faster?
 Staff is on another vlan, can give access to hyper-v host&#x27;s vlan. 
 Cannot give staff credentials to hyper-v host.
 Thanks.

 They claim that users are dropping SPAM filtering services and using their platform instead. Same claim for AV. 
 Any users of Coro made these changes?

 I decided to create an Exchange mail rule to block any email that has an .HTML attachment (and others like .HTM). Bam, perfect. Stopped getting like 30 spam tickets a week.
 Today, I got an EFT Remittance email. The attachment? An .EML file!
 Can you guess what the EML file contained? That&#x27;s right - another fake EFT Remittance email with an HTML file inside!
 I feel defeated, I can&#x27;t block .EML attachments for obvious reasons. I enjoyed the silence while it lasted.

                              <span>Heaven help me, after 20 years of working for myself, and 7 years of corporate culture but in a small rural area... our board hired an outsider from a major city to come in and be our new President. They&#x27;ve already put things in motion to shoehorn our organization into how their last place was....
 Well last week and new HR director was hired also from a much larger corporation. And next week, what do you know, they are implementing an EDGE program. Education, Development, Growth and Engagement. 
 So of course, they want to do &quot;anonymous&quot; surveys, focus groups and one-on-one meetings. Well my meeting with the Bobs is next week. 
 Sigh. I just needed 15 more years to build out my 401K. Let&#x27;s pray this doesn&#x27;t piss me off that I need to take my antiquated self out looking for a new job!

                              <span>Sooo, our CFO just &quot;retired&quot; after over a decade, and no replacement was announced, which leads me to believe it was not voluntary. Our CEO is in his 80s and, while I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s an expert in his field (Bioinformatics) The C-Level execs don&#x27;t seem too IT savvy.
 Even my direct supervisor has openly stated he is more of a &quot;People Person&quot; than an technical expert. I just started about 10 months ago, and have been working on a project that has been ongoing for over a year and a half. We needed to re-architect the infrastructure to support Azure Kubernetes Service. And while things on the Infra side are pretty good, the application is still in development. I don&#x27;t think it will ever be done.
 We are also dealing with high turnover, and nobody seems to know what&#x27;s going on. There&#x27;s no structure, our ticketing system sucks. I&#x27;ve brought this up multiple times before, but nobody is willing to take on more work. 
 So at this point, with the CFO gone, I think there is going to be a lot more scrutiny of projects going forward. We finally hired some dedicated Project Managers, but at this point I&#x27;m kind of over all of it. I&#x27;m just waiting for the fireworks. Anyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!

 Every once in a while we&#x27;ll have some weird issue on Android where the device stops syncing, which can only be diagnosed by looking at the EAS logs. Most of the time it&#x27;s because Android is trying to add an OrganizerName attribute as a child element of Exception, which is unsupported and causes the calendar to stop syncing entirely.

 At first I thought this was because our Exchange server is old and I&#x27;m holding up hopes that our Exchange Online migration would fix it. But I&#x27;m not sure I believe that since OrganizerName isn&#x27;t listed as a valid child element of Exception in the Microsoft Exchange documentation, either.
 Oh, and while I&#x27;m at it... sometimes Gmail will stop syncing for a user until I clear their out-of-office response. WTF?
 iPhone works perfectly fine. This is the polite version of the post, I could rant about what a PITA Android has been for me but I shouldn&#x27;t.

                              <span>Windows Server 2012 R2, I have checked the following:
  
No MS Services running with my account name
 
No scheduled tasks running with my account name
 
Nothing in IIS using my account name
 
 Can anyone suggest a tool that I could use to help figure out what on this server is trying to use my account name?
 EDIT: 
 Current theory is that another server I work on has some lingering connection it&#x27;s trying to authenticate on my troublesome machine. Plan is to turn off all of my dev servers that aren&#x27;t essential for keeping the environment up and running, hope that this stops the lockouts, then bring them back one by one until the lockouts start happening again.
 EDIT EDIT:
 After having multiple lockouts this morning, I&#x27;ve been free and clear since shutting down other servers. Starting to be confident that I&#x27;ll be able to determine which server is sending the request, but going to leave them down for the weekend to see if the trend continues.

For example in this scenario our &quot;new&quot; HP Designjet Z6810 has a field for smtp ip address and a desired email address, but nothing else. I don&#x27;t have an smtp server which can do no auth so I was looking for a service. Preferably something with a free tier as this will send 100 emails a year tops.
 ​
 I&#x27;m sure someone in this sub has run into this silly problem.

                              <span>I recently changed jobs into a Sysadmin\Network Admin role. I am just getting a feel for the network and making small improvements like lldp broadcast, storm control, and syslog servers. I have run into a small issue and was wondering if anyone here has overcome it. I am used to Cisco switches, while these Dell switches run a form of Cisco iOS I am locked into read only mode with CLI. From what I have read unless you factory reset the switch that is the case all the time, even though there is a security checkbox to allow 15 level access over CLI, but when checked it goes right back to unchecked in the web gui. This makes a 20 second change in CLI to all interfaces take almost an hour clicking through the web UI and waiting on it to load each time. 
 ​
 Has anyone here found a way to write changes via CLI on these Dell switches other than factory resetting?

 ​
 I have also attempted to use the Powershell Module Set-DfsrMemberShip, but it results in the same problem. This method works on other machines; however, it occasionally fails, and no matter what I try, the issue persists.
 ​
 Our existing configuration is as follows:
 Server 1: On-Site Source
 Server 2: On-Site Destination
 Server 3: Data Center Backup
 ​
 The command functions properly between Server 1 and 2, allowing me to establish the local path. However, when I include Server 3, I can add it as a member, but I&#x27;m unable to execute Membership Set and configure the LocalPath.
 ​
 Command
 dfsradmin Membership Set /RgName:$DFSName /RfName:$DFSName /MemName:$DFSServer /LocalPath:$dfsServerRepFolder /MembershipEnabled:true /StagingSize:4096 /CDSize:4096 /IsPrimary:false

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Since the current translated subtitles in teams are not up to professional standards (misinterpreting company names and stuff) I’ve been looking into better working alternatives.
 I haven’t been able to find anything really, azure cognitive services seemed cool but damn, that’s a whole rabbithole 
 Does anyone have an idea? 
 It needs to be translated live and be displayed somewhat accurately. Or is the built-in teams version the best I’ll get?
 Thanks 😀

                              <span>So I inherited my current Sysadmin role for a small company and they relied on the built-in Microsoft defender for their AV protection. I&#x27;ve always use a 3rd party like Kaspersky endpoint security or ESET NOD32. What are y&#x27;alls experience with only relying on Microsoft defender, is it enough?

                              <span>Original post
 Box and Synology are still working on the issue, and I believe are in some sort on dialogue.
 Synology developers posted in the Box Forum.
 Expanding on the behaviour they noticed, I played with the API url from the CloudSync authentication popup and worked out that modifying the &amp;state parameter to html-encode http:// to http%3A%2F%2F solves the problem. The modified URL needs to be loaded from the pop-up window, not from a different browser window, so a little console trickery is needed...
 Below are the steps to replicate my workaround: 
  
Open CloudSync
 Click the + icon to create a new link
 Select Box and click Next
 The popup authentication window appears (with the 403 Forbidden error)
 Copy the entire URL
 Pressed Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up the Browser Developer Tools
 Switch to the console tab
 Type the following into the console (note the single apostrophe at the end):
 self.location &#x3D; ‘
 Paste the URL copied in step 5
 Locate &amp;state&#x3D;http://x.x.x.x:5000 at the end of the URL and change it to:
 &amp;state&#x3D;http%3A%2F%2Fx.x.x.x:5000 (i.e. replacing the first : with %3A and each / with %2F. Don’t change anything else)
 Type a closing ’
 Press enter
 The Box authentication window should appear and you should be able to grant permission successfully.
 
 My sync is up and running after 8 days and lots of inconvenience.
 And now we wait for an official fix!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been patching Chrome and Firefox via SCCM for quite some time now and more recently started using Tenable security scanning. Tenable has been finding Chrome and Firefox installs in the C:\Users space which SCCM has not been targetting. The collections I have only find Chrome/Firefox in Program Files that SCCM itself would have deployed. I have now created some Configuration items to locate these user installs and I want to convert these to the enterprise browser versions. My issue is how do I handle bookmarks? If I uninstall the browser from the C:\User they will lose their bookmarks. I&#x27;ve been researching how to backup bookmarks and restore them in an automated way but I haven&#x27;t found a great answer. Has anyone else gone through this?

Every so often i run the “Unavailable Computers” query in log analytics to check up on the mma agent availability but i cannot get the email alerting to work. When i turn this query into an alert rule the preview shows 0 and no emails work. Suggestions?
 How is everyone monitoring these agents for disconnects or faulty services on the server?

 I&#x27;m relatively new to it, but we have reports generated for us which contain machines that have some issues. 
 How often does D365 perform a software inventory on devices? What is the initial or interval period?
 Is there a way to check when it was last conducted?
 How long does that device information stay in D365?
 Many thanks to anyone that can provide some advice or guidance

                              <span>Heyho everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently in the planing phase for the replacement of a lot older thinclients in a warehouse enviroment. For the last 10-12 years the company went the way of buying refurbished/cheap used devices to replace the faulty ones since &quot;they are just thin clients&quot;. In the last 2 years of support for them, we had like 3 or 4 devices that failed. To be fair, some were straight up old and gave up mostly because of that, however the others suffered from enviromental problems. A warehouse is full of various kinds of dirt &amp; dust in the air that settles down everywhere. Employees touch things with dirty hands and so on.
 ​
 I thought it might be better to instead replace most TCs now with some higher quality devices (and switch at that time over to Igel OS) that last longer because they are designed for that enviroment. The devices mostly potray some old software, nothing newer that could push the hardware requirements. Some raspberry Pis could probably do the job ..
 ​
 So yeah .. Any recommendations?

                              <span>I consider myself a decent programmer, but unfortunately, I lack experience in server administration and maintaining a production environment. Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve developed a web app that I want to bring live for field testing purposes. I&#x27;ve already set up a virtual server at Hetzner.com with a firewall and other security measures, such as disabling password logins.
 My application consists of:
  
NestJs/NodeJs backend
 Vue.js SPA frontend, which can be served by NestJs but also deployed independently
 Redis
 MongoDB
  
My plan is to run all of these components on a single virtual server for the testing phase (and as long as it is sufficient). I think I&#x27;ll use Docker for this setup.
 Do you have any suggestions/tips regarding this setup or thoughts on issues I may have missed? For example, regarding:
  
Logging and monitoring
 Do you recommend Docker for this setup?
 Any security measures I may have missed?
 Should I include Nginx as a reverse proxy, and why?
  
As I said this is my first own live environment and I&#x27;d really appreciate any suggestions and help.

 i am wondering if anyone has got this figured.
 We would like to use Roaming Profiles with Google Cloud Sync, currently the user needs to do this every now and again and with Mandatory Profiles they need to enable turn on sync every time. 
 The only way around this would be to change the location of chrome files which only allows one instance of chrome which does not work in our environment.
 i have enabled the policy for the new azure sync settings as well as signing on which works but does not turn on cloud sync that goes through another popup.
 i am wondering if anyone has any ideas how i can turn on Cloud Sync without user intervention or any policies or reg tweaks, any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, 
 We&#x27;re making our super-late upgrade from Exchange 2010 to 2016 (and after that to 2019), after inheriting an old environment and finding out updates not working. 
 After installing Exchange 2016 on a new server, we&#x27;ve ran into issues with migrating mailboxes: &quot;Unsupported source mailbox version Version 14.0 ‎(Build 639.0)‎.&quot;
 That version should stand for Exchange 2010 RTM. The 2010 server itself is supposed to be patched. 
 What I&#x27;ve checked:
 - In the EMC the server version shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot; - EMC is said to be inaccurate: Application binary versions (checked from the running store.exe location, no second wrong install locations) are 14.3.513.0, which should be the very last rollup of SP3
 - Get-ExchangeServer AdminDisplayVersion also shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot;
 - The current Exchange schema version is rangeUpper 15332 (or Exchange 2016 CU18)
 - The &quot;Exchange Servers&quot; AD group only contains current running (the 2010 and 2016) servers
 - In ADSIEdit, Configuration/Services/Microsoft Exchange/[domain]/Administrative Groups/Exchange Administrative Group (...)/Servers also only contains the current running servers
 What I&#x27;ve tried:
 - First, most of the instructions that were followed are from the Exchange Deployment Assistant
 - Trying to run the upgraded installer for 2010 just to be sure but it says nothing to upgrade
 - Searching for any non-installed updates through Windows update, including hidden ones - Restarted services and machines so no lingering processes should exist
 - Creating a new database on the 2010 server and moving mailboxes to it in case the database has an affected version as well 
 Misc:
 - We currently do not intend to move to Exchange Online
 My current understanding would be that mailboxes also have a version and have to be upgraded. How do I go about doing that? Otherwise, what issue am I not seeing?

 This leaves me and one other Snr Engineer as the sole people in our large Org with the &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;. Eg all the top level access.
 At what point do you trust a new boss with this? Normally with a new peer you would gradually provide more access as it was warranted and you trusted them more. With a boss, that dynmac is quite different.

 Zero Trust CloudFlare Tunnel
 Control Box is running on Port 9090
 Https is enabled from trusting origin in settings of CloudFlare
 Hi all,
 I am new with the whole Cloudflare side of things, so bare with me please 📷
 I have a phone system running iPECS eMG100
 It’s a control box running on my local network. I am trying to use a tunnel to log into it which works as I get the webpage looking for me to log in when i am out and about with my laptop
 I enter the details, and it logs me in but it’s only in “Read Only” mode
 When I log in locally, it logs me in with read / write and I can do the usual.
 I am logging in with the same administrator account with both through the tunnel and locally.
 Did any of you guys ever experience this with your tunnels and web admin panels? Is there some configuration settings that I might have missed in the setup in CloudFlare?

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid thirties and I&#x27;ve just finished being self employed for nearly eleven years. The job I did involved a lot of use of technology, from commissioning and deploying web apps, to building some little internal windows app of my own in autohotkey, to BEING the entire IT department for my small company...
 I&#x27;m ready to work hard and in a dedicated way - but this time for someone else.
 I&#x27;ve done all sorts of different things. I&#x27;m REALLY interested in technology and have been tinkering since I was about ten!
 I have used all sorts of systems over the years from Acorns at secondary school to CentOS now at home (in a homelab type setting). I&#x27;ve provided IT support for paying business/private customers, and have used Unix systems to cobble together working solutions for my own needs as and when.
 I&#x27;ve created/configured/used (these are examples) Asterisk (FreePBX), NodeRed, ESP32 microcontrollers, AutoHotkey, Home Assistant (writing the automations in YAML), Docker, Photoshop, MQTT, Excel.... I have some limited experience with tools such as Cron, SSH, I used to make websites for clients 20 years ago but wouldn&#x27;t have a clue what the in vogue framework is now...
 My IT skills are perhaps beyond 1st line tech support I&#x27;d say (tell me if you disagree!).
 I have an IT related master&#x27;s qualification - but it&#x27;s a few years out of date now, due to the time I&#x27;ve had &#x27;out&#x27; running my own business.
 I&#x27;d need to find somewhere that was willing to take a chance on a quick learner with a MASSIVE interest in tech and a track record of tinkering and experimenting, iterating and building projects.
 Any ideas where to start looking?
 Working remote is absolutely fine for me as I have a garden office at the end of the garden where I can go and just focus for the working day. No distractions.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking for advice, tips, leads at this point. Where should I be looking and how should I be tailoring my CV to (ideally) pivoting towards tech?
 THANK YOU!

                              <span>Our Mac print server recently died (the Mac mini would no longer successfully boot up) so we hurriedly set up a new one with Monterey and the latest Epson print drivers. Individually the printers all work fine but our follow-me print queue just produced a blank page on certain models (we have a mix of WF-C579R WF-C879R and WF-C20600). We raised the issue with PaperCut and they were able to quickly highlight that the cause is that the drivers are outputting ESCP instead of Postscript. 
 I know there&#x27;s a &quot;Generic Postscript&quot; driver on macOS but it&#x27;s my understanding that if we use this we lose access to printer features such as colour profiles, which are important as our Mac users are primarily Art &amp; Photography. 
 Is there a way to configure the Epson print driver on macOS to use / output Postscript?

 Apologies in advance if this is the worst post of the day, but I&#x27;m hoping my sysadmin family of Microsoft experts can help me as I&#x27;m a bit lost.
 Personally, I&#x27;m a Mac admin in a Google workspace environment with comparatively little knowledge of Office 365 other than creating users and licenses in our Office 365 instance for the small number of our team that can only to communicate with clients via Teams/OneDrive etc due to their security requirements.
 I have had a request through from a client to “make sure the external company adds Federation to the following SIP domains…” This in order to facilitate comms over Teams from our company to theirs, rather than the current clunky setup of client VMS / VPN.
 However I can’t find what I’m supposed to be looking for in the admin portal. Google searching tells me it&#x27;s something to do with some settings on our on-prem Skype server, but we obviously don’t have one of those, but that could also be because I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m searching for.
 If anyone has a couple of minutes to point me in the right direction I&#x27;d be super grateful

                              <span>Happy Friday everyone!
 Today I made the troubling discovery of a UPC/APC SC connector mismatch on the demarcation point of my company&#x27;s sole internet circuit. I remember learning that this was a big no no when I was in school, but that cable was installed 3-4 years ago prior to me working here and has remained connected ever since without any noticeable problems (from my perspective, at least), so what exactly are the concerns associated with this improper mating? For reference, the demarc has the APC connector (female) to which our ISP&#x27;s NID connects via a SC/UPC-terminated simplex fiber cable.
 The main reason for my asking is because I&#x27;m about to send a strongly worded email to our ISP telling them to get out here and fix it, but since I&#x27;ve never dealt with this before I don&#x27;t know what expectations I should have as a customer. Do they need to polish the demarc&#x27;s connector before they install the new cable, or should it be re-terminated? Do they need to bring an OTDR out and re-certify the connection? Etc, etc...

                              <span>Does user roles &amp; assignment management really have to be this difficult when using SSO on greenlake/central?
 Why can&#x27;t my SSO link my federated users to the portal, then allow the permissions to adjusted from the GreenLake side instead of jacking around with &quot;Azure sso - Attributes &amp; Claims&quot; withing the app sso for each role we create?
 Is this Legit or is there a better way to do this? We&#x27;re thinking about moving away from SSO due to this.

                              <span>We have much more teams these days that are spread across various locations and are uploading/downloading various source code files etc. 
 Lately we are seeing many issues with reported slow speeds when downloading files. WAN circuit is often 1Gbps using SdWan with the file download speed at 300-400kbps.
 Does anyone have good strategies for dealing with such issues?
 I used iPerf to run a test and this basically confirmed the issue for me. Now I need to figure out why it’s running so slow.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Apologies if this isnt the place for this post, but I am looking for a little bit of career guidance, or even just general options/paths y&#x27;all have taken in your careers in networking.
 A little bit of background on me, and what I currently do:
 I&#x27;m a 28 year old college grad (unrelated major), and currently work for a semi-major bandwidth provider in the Fiber/DWDM space. My day to day job consists of managing new builds, system extensions, grooms, and anything else needed to expand network capacity for new and existing customers. I&#x27;ve been in this role for ~ 3 years, and I&#x27;m somewhat lost on where to go from here. My background in Layer 2 is pretty limited, past a very basic understsanding of BGP/OSPF as it pertains to my current job. I have a lot of interest in learning more on that side of things, but Im unsure how I would go about that. I&#x27;m aware of certs like Net+, CCNA, CCNP etc. but I&#x27;m unusure if that would get me anywhere in network engineering without relelvant experience. 
 I&#x27;m hesitant to apply to NOC, Systems Admin jobs, simply because I would be looking at a significant pay cut (though I understand if that is a route I&#x27;d need to take to get my foot in the door). I also like the space I&#x27;m currently in, but don&#x27;t really know what my future options look like for Fiber Optic/Dwdm related jobs. 
 I&#x27;d love to hear opinions on potential career paths in Fiber/DWDM, and networking, and get some advice on next steps I should take in my career.

                              <span>We use Aruba wirless, clearpass + controllers. We are a bit at a loss. We are told about the problem after the fact and when we attempt to replicate with a variety of devices, we are not able. 
 Problem: A user who has not been on the network previously will attempt to connect to the Guest SSID. This is an open SSID that should load a guest captive portal page. When the user connects, they have no internet and are not able to load the portal page. If the user disables MAC randomization/Private IP address, they have internet and the guest page loads.
 We will keep trying to replicate the issue but I am hoping someone may be able to point us in the right direction or has some similar experiences in the past. Unfortunately it happened during a board meeting and on one informed us or provided us with any information. The problem seems to be very rare.

                              <span>Hello Folks,
 We are currently running into issue with Cisco Meraki/OpenDNS setup. We have remote users and connted to internet using Meraki and users are unable to reach some of the site using Chrome/Edge. The users are getting error message like this site is not private and if you continue it will give the Cisco Umbrella &quot;This site is blocked due to content filtering&quot;. The strange part is, the site works fine with Firefox. I looked into cert on chrome and the cert is under Opendns. I tried updating chrome/removed cache and history, installed the cisco opendns root certificate nothing working.

                              <span>Hi,
 Looking to purchase some tools for inspecting and cleaning my LC fiber connections at home.
 Can anyone recommend some affordable tools for home user?
 If there is an inexpensive way to get photo of how clean the fiber is that would be great too! But if not manual tools will work.
 Amazon links appreciated but if something good is not available on amazon please still link it!
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey everyone. Scouring the internet and this is my last effort human to human. I’m running BISDN/yocto Linux on a small router. The image I’m currently using is built with FRR 8.2.2. Looking to work some BGP testing in a lab. Our prod devices are using FRR 6.0 so I want to roll back to match. Can anyone point me to a good work up of downgrading?!? I see the different packages and versions in the FRR repository but I can’t find any work up/walkthrough of how to blow away the current load and build back in the older version.
 Very much appreciated!

                              <span>I’m an IT tech and I recently did a project where we connected two switches together that are in separate buildings - about a mile apart. We used single mode fiber all the way through and installed a second line as a secondary. This was pre existing fiber infrastructure, I just patched things into the adjacent dark fiber patch panels to get from point A to point B. The second building is a new building and the patch panels are new. 
 I’m not very well versed in fiber and such but I did do a ping test from switch to switch and got under 1ms responses which I thought was all good. Now Network team conducted a TX/RX optical power test from the switches and found that we’re losing about -10db on the run on both lines and both ways. So right now our RX on both switches is around -13 to -16 db. So my question is, is this normal or is something seriously wrong and what is most likely the cause? The network team is making a big deal out of it and actively trying to make me look like I screwed up their network so I’m not sure how to respond. 
 Any advice appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve emailed their support address 3 times in the last week about a chunk that&#x27;s been stuck in rebooting and haven&#x27;t gotten any response- no emails, and the chunk is still stuck.
 Obviously it&#x27;s Chunkhost and I&#x27;m not expecting an immediate response, but a week is ridiculous. Has anyone been able to reach them? It&#x27;s not a critical server or anything (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t host anything critical with them), but I am paying for a server that&#x27;s currently down and that&#x27;s not ok.
 Alternatively, if anyone has any suggestions for reaching someone over there, I would appreciate it.

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking into Silverfort for adding MFA to our on-prem including our service accounts. Curious what people&#x27;s thoughts are if anybody&#x27;s evaluated them. Also curious how they compare to Crowdstrike&#x27;s IDP module, Authlite, Duo, &amp; smart cards? Seems good (also maybe more coverage than Duo across powershell &amp; psexec) but a bit pricey...
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a folder on a file server(2019) that is shared with some information for an application that a vendor states we should limit user access to as much as possible. So for share permissions I have Everyone full control. For the NTFS permissions I have SYSTEM(FULL), LOCAL ADMINS(FULL), and DOMAIN COMPUTERS(READ). The LOCAL ADMINS group on the file server has domain admins inside of it. Everything is working fine and the application inside of it is being deployed without issue while at the same time no users have any access to the folder except DOMAIN ADMINS.
 Now the strange thing is if I&#x27;m on the file server with my domain admin account and I try to open the folder by either the filesystem or the share I get prompted with the message &quot;You don&#x27;t currently have permissions to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to the folder.&quot; Remember the local admins on the file server has the domain admins in the group. Not sure why it&#x27;s telling me I don&#x27;t have access. Now if I click continue it adds my DA account to the NTFS permissions explicitly. This is screwing up our folder permissions consistency. If I didn&#x27;t truly have access as the message stated how did it explicitly add my DA account with full control? That seems kind of messed up if that was really the case.
 One final note. If I&#x27;m on my office machine and run computer management as my DA connecting the file server and then navigate to the shares, when opening the folder I don&#x27;t get prompted with the message above. If I look at the NTFS permissions everything is correct. WTF? I have to say I&#x27;m confused by this one. I would imagine opening the folder on the file system on the server would be the sure fire way to get in, but remotely accessing it resolves the issue?
 Can anyone explain what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>Hi all, I believe I won&#x27;t be the first one to face this issue but I could not find any answers on the internet. 
 In our company we own about 12 domains, for those domains we have about 20+ SSL certificates (top level, subdomains, wildcard, etc) that are used for services like customer-facing websites, internal ERP systems, teamsconnector, load-balancers in cloud services etc. 
 Those cerficates all expire in different months and it is so hard to keep track of the expiry date, make sure they are renewed, and most importantly-- make sure that the new certificate are sent to the vendor and they update the certificate in time. 
 We have a few occassions when the renewal is missed by internal IT stuff, or the renewed certificate is sent to the vendor but they sit on it until the website goes down.
 Is there any suggestions for how to manage that?

                              <span>I am playing catch-up from the last admin. Freshly documenting everything to a spreadsheet for me. It is not for C-Suite, VPs or Directors to review. I am constantly being asked to send spreadsheets I&#x27;ve made for me, to a VP that should&#x27;ve documented theirselves if they needed the information.
 As per usual at the time, I used to send VP my spreadsheet because &quot;they said to&quot;, then they would subject me to all sorts of suggestions and changes and additions that would make the data kindergarten level understandable(colors, bold, &#x27;move this column here&#x27;, &#x27;add this column for that data&#x27;...etc), to them, but unnecessary if you actually read the information. I already have the bolds, underlines and colors necessary...FOR ME. I have now stopped (stopped sending my documentation, it is on our NAS, only I can edit it. They can read it) since realizing that not sending that data bears no consequences. It&#x27;s a small enough company that anyone in our IT realm could&#x27;ve done this and can do this. This VP also makes it a habit of taking other individuals&#x27; ideas and passing them as their own publicly.
 Has anyone else had an issue where once a VP/Dir knows that you have information useful to them(that they never thought would be before they knew you had it), they commandeer the format of your notes so that it suddenly becomes an involuntary collaborative effort?

There are fiber to Ethernet converters everywhere. The cabling in some of the buildings is thrown together, he had a main connection running through an old t1 punchdown block. It&#x27;s kind of fun figuring and straightening all this out though.

                              <span>Preface - I own a tech shop but we&#x27;re on the hardware side of things.
 I&#x27;m trying to set a client up with Tailscale and RDP so he can securely connect to his office machine and operate quickbooks and all his other software(CPA) through remote desktop. I&#x27;ve got Tailscale set up and working correctly. The problem I&#x27;m running into is authenticating the RDP session. If I open RDC on the client computer and enter the computer name of the host, it brings up an authentication dialogue. He&#x27;s using a 365 account so it&#x27;s already populated, and simply asks for the password. I know I&#x27;m entering it correctly and I&#x27;ve tried multiple times but it&#x27;s reporting the password incorrect. 
 So his MS account is &#x27;firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27;. RDC shows the login as a Microsoft Account &#x27;/firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27; so I&#x27;m just not seeing the problem here. We have good connectivity obviously as I mis-entered the computer name a couple times and it reported not finding any computers with that name on the network. I&#x27;m already home from my service call to his office but I told him I&#x27;d get to the bottom of it and remote in to make whichever changes deemed necessary by the powers that be - r/sysadmin
 send help.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I made a script to validate MFA on users accounts in Azure AD using the Graph API. It checks if the account is registered with the Microsoft Authenticator app or any 3rd party authenticator app. If the account hasn&#x27;t enabled MFA it will flag them with a date using custom security attributes, and in 7 days if they haven&#x27;t registered MFA it will disable their account. 
 ​
 Just to note I have this disabling the users on-premises account since we&#x27;re assuming they&#x27;re synced users from AD. You can always adjust the script to meet your needs as I have a function in there to disable the users Azure AD account but you will need to stop syncing the accountEnabled attribute in AAD Connect.

                              <span>I know this is an absurd question, but specifically to the sysadmins that are one running the whole show - is it common or did you ever encountered users that engaged in flirting to get you to put them in your priority/preference list? Is this something that happens? At times I felt this happened to me but it confused me greatly if this is common?
 Sorry for the dumb question I just want to know if some users do that, especially the attractive ones that might be used to getting things that way.

                              <span>Hi, this is my first post here, but I&#x27;ve been a lurker for a few months now.
 I work for a very small company. We have 5 employees, including the owner. I work remotely and the rest work in the office. We have a guy who got our Windows server setup about 2 years ago, along with the networking infrastructure in the office. The server is used to store our working files, and to allow us to access it remotely through a program called Centrestack. We have multiple backups going, one of which we take off-site. And we use Avast Business for our antivirus on the server and each employee&#x27;s laptop or desktop.
 I have been the default on-site &quot;IT&quot; guy since we moved into the office. I handle setting up new computers (we had around 13 employees last year, so I had more work to handle), creating new us…</span>

 Several of our services are down and the logs show authentication failures.

What&#x27;s odd is we can log in with the service account running these services over RDP and it seems fine otherwise. 
 The account in question had it&#x27;s password reset by the other admin because they had forgotten it. This was around when the problems were reported. I know what the password was and reset it again to the old password, but this did not re…</span>

 I&#x27;m a part-time college professor in addition to my regular role as an IT manager, and want to survey all of you to check how many enterprises in 2023 are using desktops vs laptops for employees. We have a computer hardware course, and a disagreement between a few of us professors on what the current trend is for deployed hardware to ensure our course is relevant and up to date, as this course objective is to ensure students are prepared to be technicians in the working world, likely supporting organizations and enterprises.
 My experience has been majority of enterprises and work environments nowadays are laptop based, and rarely desktop based. 
 Can I ask for your feedback on what hardware approach you have in your environments? It seems I can&#x27;t do a poll type post to get a vote, so would appreciate your thoughts as comments below.
 If you do use desktops, what kind / size / form factor? Larger towers, mini towers, SFF, Micro, etc?
 EDIT - Thank you everyone for the replies so far, I&#x27;ll endeavour to individually comment and thank each of you by replying to your comments as I have time :) It&#x27;s very much appreciated to ensure we educate our students to join the industry in the future and be well equipped with knowledge by the time they graduate

 Microsoft has decided that all these attachments are &quot;high confidence phishing&quot; and it will not let them through. We need an admin to go through them and release them. No way to bypass this filtering, no way to let users release these messages, not even a good way to see what has been released and what hasn&#x27;t (if the email is sent to a distribution and you release to one user it will show as released, even though most users didn&#x27;t get it).

 Learn more leads to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-to-do-when-a-malicious-file-is-found-in-sharepoint-online-onedrive-or-microsoft-teams-01e902ad-a903-4e0f-b093-1e1ac0c37ad2?ui&#x3D;en-us&amp;rs&#x3D;en-us&amp;ad&#x3D;us - which is useless from what I&#x27;m seeing.

 Any ideas?

Anyways, I got an email when I sign up for a domain name through the company Hover. I&#x27;ve had a few issues with this company, including very slow emails sinking, and troubles with linking it to my Gmail account, but something that I find it very weird and doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is why a lot of times when I try to sign up for some thing using my email address it says that my email is invalid. For example if I go to a grocery store and try to sign up for their rewards card or something, usually it says that my email is not valid and they asked me if I spelled it right, etc. When this happens I often feel defensive like &quot;listen pal, I pay for this email address and it&#x27;s definitely legit - do you want me to prove it to you? what&#x27;s your email address? I&#x27;ll email you right now!&quot; lol. Only half joking. But seriously, why is this happening, and is there a way to fix it? I did use my email name to be [info@myname.com](mailto:info@myname.com) - so perhaps some people think it&#x27;s a fake name, and like a chump like me couldn&#x27;t possibly have such a personalized email, but is it a problem with Hover? Or is it a problem with my email settings? Or is it that the &quot;info@&quot; emails are somehow blacklisted as not personal emails, or are considered like &quot;no reply&quot; emails?

                              <span>Feel stupid asking this question but having a hard time wrapping my head around this. We had a provider wan link outage yesterday. During the outage I could not get to any internal IP based devices, ie, switches, firewall, servers, etc. I use internal dns servers on my desktop/laptop. Gateway is a layer 3 switch. I cannot via browser access the switch address which is just an ip, not any specific internal ip only devices that do not have dns names.
 I was able to ping, unc paths work. By the time I was getting ready to try ssh, etc. the wan link came back up and everything started working. This had happened one other time and at the time I didn&#x27;t think a lot of it because it was real short. I do know this was a wan link issue and not a core issue.
 I did look into my browswer setting and automatic proxy was on. Would this cause the issue? Would this still be dns (as everything is dns)? I can do some testing early mornings before office gets going to figure this out but things just don&#x27;t seem to make sense.
 Appreciate any thoughts, ideas.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with getting rid of all the Out of Support .NET Core versions in our environment at work (5.0 and earlier, since only 6.0 is currently in support). I&#x27;ve tried using the Uninstall Tool, which removed a few loose versions but honestly not much that it can see. I also tried modifying the Visual Studio 2019 Installer to uncheck the Out of Support individual component boxes, but that only removed the most recent version of each version (ex. removed 5.0.17 but not 5.0.14).
 I&#x27;m at a loss of what else to do other than figure out scripting or manual removal of all the loose folders that still remain on the 300+ machines that Qualys reports with vulnerable .NET Core versions. Any ideas?

                              <span>Wondering if anyone here has purchased anything from PCLiquidations.com, and if so how did it go? Any horror stories?
 I need to find a cost effective vendor for replacement laptops for my guys out in the field. Our need isn&#x27;t enough to buy in bulk; more ad hoc purchase as my field user&#x27;s beat their laptops into oblivion.
 For context, I work in construction management.
 Thanks!

The site is not blocked through our firewall, and not blocked through malwarebytes. It was working a few days ago. There has been some spam email that has been cycling through our network from that website. but Any block request go through me. We arent running VPN or Proxy. and i dont think office365 would be blocking any domains. ive tried two different browsers. any one have any suggestions?
 ​
 thanks

                              <span>Hello, this is somewhat of a follow up post of my rant about a demanding user. 
 This time, It is their inbox. It is constantly filling up. We get 2-3 tickets a week from this user about her damn emails (always with that annoying red !). For information, this user works in accounting, They seem to treat their inbox as the archives for entire department. (Filled up a 50gb archive in 3 months) No one else in accounting has this issue!
 How are you folks dealing with situations like this? it seems like everywhere that I&#x27;ve worked, there is someone in accounting who clutches on to all emails like a golden egg.I am getting extremely frustrated with having to deal with this 1 persons email every other day, looking for any guidance on how to deal with this, should I ask her boss why she needs to keep all these emails? I am not aware of any compliance requirements.

                              <span>My Org has implemented a new policy requiring all new and existing Windows devices to be encrypted with BitlLocker. My experience with it is limited but I have a little bit of fear of the unknown. 
 Aside from storing the individual bitlocker keys in a secure location, is there anything I should be concerned about when implementing it or it is generally smooth sailing? Is system performance generally impacted? Some of our systems are 5+ years old. Is it possible to brick systems with bitlocker?
 Also, are there automated ways to enable BitLocker that you would recommend?

                              <span>Anyone ever run into the challenge of wanting to set up a device for ldap auth and the product has a character limit for the bind DN?
 This conflicts with our well organized AD structure which has such accounts in a particular OU, ending up having to move it to a non-standard spot, which causes severe gear grinding.
 We are running into this with our Tripplite PDUs. First time I&#x27;ve ever run into something so boneheaded.
 Am I overlooking some obvious workaround for this or do I just have to swallow my OCD on this one and live with the account in an odd spot - which for us would be the very tippy-top of our domain.
 thx!

                              <span>Is there a way in GPO to set how much space system restore points can use on the C drive? I ask because we are running AVD and noticed a bunch of C drives with low space. 
 I noticed all the space is being used in System Volume Information. When I went and set the slider to only use 50% of the drive for points it released the space back.
 I can actually stop using restore points all together if thats an option also. These machines are dispensable if that makes sense.

                              <span>Hello!
 I have 5 printers, 150 users (not all of them print, probably 20 active users).
 I&#x27;m looking for a cloud printing solution. So far I&#x27;ve looked into Printix, ezeep, PaperCut Hive - those solutions would cost me 3500$ or more per year - way too much for me.
 Can you recommend cheaper alternatives? I want to be able to deploy them easily, have some sort of control who can print. In the past I tried PaperCut Mobility Print but I couldn&#x27;t find a way to control who can print.
 Thank you in advance

                              <span>When using the NPS assistent for 802.1x you are prompted to create or select a Radius client (i.e. a switch or wireless access point) and then select create the restrictions/permissions that should be associated with this device.
 After finishing the assistent, several rules are created. None of them specify the device that they are applied to, just the port type (wired or wireless).
 Questions:
 How can i determine, which rule is applied to which device?
 How do i apply access rules for wired or wireless connections to multiple devices?
 ​
 Any hints are appreciated.

                              <span>Looking for some advice from veteran system admins. 
 I’m young under 26 years old, and a system admin.
 I eventually want to get into cloud security (I know broad but not sure exactly what yet). My current role covers a lot from level 1 tickets to more difficult projects/troubleshooting systems, and pay is not the best (low balled myself because I wanted the job) but love that I got this position so early in life.
 So wanted to know was it worth it for yourself to make work and getting certifications your whole life this early? Staying late in the office (long commute), studying after work and weekends for certs, online classes.
 Was the position/high salary worth it later on in life to give up traveling, experiencing life at a young age?

 I have a SCCM server running on ms server 2012R2 Datacenter, who gives a very strange error.
 When i create a file or dir it goes oke, if i am on the server and try to change this file or dir on driveletter level then i can do than with no problem. BUT when i try to change the file or dir via an UNC path then i get an invalid MS-DOS function.
 I scouted the internet for this problem but did not get any working solutions. did chkdisk, regedit and hotfix/update to latest patch level, with no solution.
 Who has an bright idea or solved a simular problem.

                              <span>The initial version of our service consisted of distributed components that were orchestrated by AWS Step Functions. The two most expensive operations in terms of cost were the orchestration workflow and when data passed between distributed components. To address this, we moved all components into a single process to keep the data transfer within the process memory, which also simplified the orchestration logic.

 Note that this is only regarding one tool and that it&#x27;s still running as a cloud service. But it&#x27;s quite an interesting read.

                              <span>So im making some GPO changes to block users from creating or adding data to their pst files.
 Made these changes on gpo editor using the administrative templates
 Policy:
 Prevent users from adding new content to existing PST files - enabled
 Prevent users from adding PSTs to outlook profiles and/or prevent user sharing exclusive PSTs - enabled and no PST can be added
 Auto archive settings - disabled
 Disable file|archive - enabled 
 The registry keys get created with the proper value of 1 ( acording to MS ) but when i go into outlook i can still create new PST and add data/mails to existing PST 
 been breaking my head for almost a week already and i cant find whats missing , again the policy gets applied &gt; creates the registry keys with proper value but then dosent work

 We have an old Windows XP machine for wood working.
 The XP machine is not in domain. Until now a shared folder was mapped from Windows 10 computer (smb1.0 is enabled).
 Now we can&#x27;t reach the share, always prompt for the password but the user is not locking out from AD after 3 bad password.
 I can ping the domain controller from the Windows XP machine, everything looks fine.
 I tried to restart the machines the firewall on windows 10 machine is turned off.
 You have any idea what can I test?
 Update1 : I created an XP VM and from that VM I can reach the share. So the Windows 10 machine is good.

                              <span>Our Office 365 tenant just started having issues receiving emails for companies like ZIX, RiverApp, and SignNow just to name a few. The message is hitting Exchange Online, failing to be delivered to the recipient, and sending a NDR to the sender. The Error is as follows.
 Error: ‎550 5.7.162 OmeEncryptionAgent; Permanent Failure 550-5.7.162 Exception encountered: RmException. 550-5.7.162 Exception message: ETR encryption only applies to outgoing mail. FailureCode:UnknownFailure. Recoverable:False.. 550 5.7.162 Please contact your system administrator for more information‎
 A non-delivery report (NDR) message was sent to ‎noreply@signnow.com‎. The NDR might provide more details about why the email message wasn&#x27;t delivered and how to fix the issue. 
 We have the proper licensing to use OME and haven&#x27;t had any issues until Monday. The only thing that was done was an ALIAS domain was added for Exchange Online. I am able to send Sensitive Emails just fine.
 I contacted our reseller and they stated the those companies don&#x27;t have the required license and feature enabled to send a sensitive emails and there is nothing wrong on our end.
 Anyone have any ideas?

 I can&#x27;t see any way to change that, but I might be missing something, does anyone here know either how to change the owner of the review or make the emails stop going to me, but still go to the reviewers?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some insight from those who manage platforms either via UEM or multiple MDMs. We currently have Intune in place for Windows and looking to move to Samsung Knox for Android devices (Samsung only) as Intune didn&#x27;t have enough functionality and was infuriating to manage and push updates from.
 We&#x27;re now presented with a few iOS and Mac devices that need to be added to our network and managed under MDM. I&#x27;m toying with the idea of having a third solution for Apple devices so each one is fit for purpose but have had counter arguments that it&#x27;s best to keep things under a single pane of glass for ease of management.
 What are the pro&#x27;s and cons of both in your eyes? We don&#x27;t have much onsite resource so looking to avoid technical limitations and &quot;quirks&quot; where possible, but then also not add too many solutions into the mix for this reason.

                              <span>On devices running Windows 10 22H2 it appears that the Internet Explorer feature is being removed/ uninstalled automatically without any manual intervention. This includes the iexplore.exe being removed resulting in IE Mode not working. 
 Cannot for the life of me figure out why. Even read articles from Microsoft. Maybe I’m missing the obvious. 
 Anyone else experiencing this?

 After enrolling, IT admins will receive an email every time known issues are added or updated with new information, including changes in status, new workarounds, or issue resolutions.
 As Redmond explained, it is only available for those with admin roles in organizations with eligible Windows or Microsoft 365 for Business subscriptions that provide access to Windows release health in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
 “First, log in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and locate Windows release health under the Health menu,” said Microsoft senior program manager Mabel Gomes.

                              <span>Hi all. Work for a development company - we currently have devs supply us with their personal github account, and we provide them with the appropriate level of access for their role.
 I dislike this as we have no control over the account itself, and many people do not have a display or first/last name, meaning that in a situation where we need to offboard someone quickly we will be faced with trying to decipher what their account is called, and its always some nickname or &#x27;cooldevguy-23&#x27;, so theres a chance we miss them or disable the wrong account 
 ​
 How do you handle your github? Has anyone had this situation? At a previous company I was at we just created new accounts from the beginning...

                              <span>Guys,
 we need to be able to stop a yubikey from showing up in a VDA but the devices tab is missing from the VDA. I hear theres a setting in CitrixGroupPolicyManagement_x64.msi, but the DL is locked behind a company account which we do not have, nor to I think we&#x27;d need one.
 I tried working with registry keys but no cigar. The VDA usage interacts with our yubikey SC and locks it&#x27;s PIN shortly after. Tried reinstalling citrix workspace as admin but no devices tab shows up in the VDA.
 Can someone provide CitrixGroupPolicyManagement_x64.msi?
 This is like...really annoying :D

 ​
 I&#x27;ve been messing with ADFS since company has decided to audit the ADFS login using a 3rd party software. In order for the 3rd party software to audit can capture the details of the user logging in correctly, it requires that all relying parties be added with 6 new claim rules.
 Any idea how I can achieve this?

                              <span>Hello. I am currently in the midst of making a cheaper environment for out company in azure, but using cheaper resource tiers comes with limitation. One of them being that a basic tier VPN GW can only use Certs for P2S and its SSTP.
 So therefor we are going to be using certs. the vpn gw has a self signed root cert. and all clients need a client cert signed by the root.
 we want to be able to deploy individual certs to each employee to allow for evoking access to individual users.
 Manually making client certs for each employee is not feasible. so i want to deploy a script via intune that makes this cert for each employee.
 now here comes the problems, i need to sign these certs with a remote root. but i cant for the life of me find out how. we have the root in a key vault. but every article talking about using csr is for for signing something to the kv. 
 how do i sign with a remote root cert from the client device via a powershell script.

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I help out and have started digitising a local charity, part of this is to give them Office 365. My plan was to create a Microsoft Form so internal users could create more users inputting all the details, including selecting groups from a drop down... Sadly time has not been on my side and it&#x27;s been a few months, and I&#x27;ve still not got around to testing/getting something working.
 ​
 Does anyone have a template form and automate that they wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing to help me/charity out before i put this out to the r/slavelabour sub.
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>By default SharePoint is set to retain 500 major versions of a document. PPT docs in my environment can easily be several hundred megs each and staff are hammering these docs daily creating lots of versions as they save. A single file can be taking up 200 gig of versions and I&#x27;ve got quite a few of these files which is swamping my 1TB quota. It&#x27;s a pretty small and lean business too so they can&#x27;t afford the extorsionate prices for extra SharePoint storage. Meanwhile, we&#x27;ve got groups of people collaborating on reports that they write which legitimately require lots of versions but aren&#x27;t anywhere near the same file size. How do I manage this runaway storage consumption? Is there a way to set SharePoint to keep no more than X megabytes of versions per file at which point it purges old versions?

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 For those who work y NetOps daily operations, how do you handle the high number of alerts received by email?
 I personally have the rule to move them to a separate folder and just look them up in case of an issue arises. The &quot;critical alerts&quot; are not in that rule, they rarely are triggered.

                              <span>Hi there! So sorry if this is not allowed but just looking for some direction or help as I’ve been looking for hours and cant seem to find much. I need to find a price point of an Ekinops ONE2501. I have emailed the company but have yet to hear back anything so just wondering if anyone can shed some light on even just a general idea of a price point. Any input is greatly appreciated! Thank you

                              <span>TL;DR Site is abandoned, automated services to send product codes aren&#x27;t working, and Colby West (owner) is MIA.
 I recently had reached out to Colby via the site&#x27;s &quot;contact&quot; form and via an email I found on his YT account (last video in 2020). I waited a week and no response to my inquiry, so I just went ahead and purchased the eBook.
 Well, the automated email services that send the .ascm file out aren&#x27;t working. Neither are the discount codes for the stencils. Tried reaching out to Colby on LinkedIn - no response and hasn&#x27;t been active in over 2 months. He hasn&#x27;t been active on Facebook since 2015 and Twitter since 2018.
 Currently waiting on PayPal&#x27;s bullshit claim process to get my $50 back.

 I&#x27;m interviewing for a new job next week - managing enterprise deployments using Cisco Meraki and VeloCloud SD-WAN. All my previous networking experience has been in a Juniper and Aruba environment - but I really want this job! Since I have about a week to study, what advice would you have or resources would you recommend for getting an up to speed on Meraki and VeloCloud SD-Wan? I know I could pick the skills up quickly on the job, but I want to show some understanding and knowledge in the interview.

 ​
 Can I use 10GBASE-T ports for stacking on the 1960 12XGT JL805A switch. My goal is to have more SFP+ ports for uplinking the servers.
 ​
 Another question, is it good to be used as CORE for a network with about 10 Switch 1960 below it?

                              <span>Does anybody know of any well-known network equipment vendors who actually embrace 3rd party optics?
 We all know the typical vendor spiel about how &quot;3rd party optics are not supported&quot;, and some of them go so far as to disallow their use altogether (by disabling ports, etc).
 Are any actually OK with these optics? Maybe not to the point of supporting or troubleshooting them when they&#x27;re a problem, but at least making an effort to integrate?
 It seems like there is opportunity in the industry for vendors to differentiate themselves by treating optics the way many server manufacturers treat hard drives (or at least used to).

                              <span>Mostly I&#x27;m curious about the enterprise state of the industry with respect to SFP56 for Ethernet (less so for infiniband).
 I know there are &quot;25GbE&quot; cards with single SFP28 ports on them (like the Mellanox ConnectX-4&#x27;s), but I&#x27;ve not seen any &quot;50GbE&quot; cards with a single-channel SFP56 port. I&#x27;m asking about PCIe cards, but if there are N-port SFP56 cards for switches and routers, then that would be interesting to know.
 So do single-channel SFP56 cards/switch ports exist, or is SFP56 too new at this point for that to be rolled out?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Please excuse the post if this is in the wrong subreddit. I am looking to see if a proposed network design is possible.
 We currently have a network that is double-nat&#x27;d as that is what the customer is providing us. Our network is communicating via cellular to a separate building to view all required devices. We are looking to bring all devices over to one network, however, there seems to be stability issues and due to the nature of the customer, want to keep the networks separated.
 The caveat is that both networks are programmed with the same subnet, so adding a third router will not work. (I know I know)
 As a temporary solution (Again I know), I want to propose the design below to see if it is feasible. It would effectively require the addition of two new routers to a tripple nat&#x27;d design. The requirement is that router 1 be able to talk to the devices behind router 2. My though was via port forwarding.
 Feel free to downvote if I am being dumb in my thought process or let me know if this is not possible.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just wondering, first, does Cisco still offer CLCs with larger orders of new equipment?
 Specifically, I work in K12 and we buy everything via E-Rate and our equipment ships with the EDU suffix.
 I&#x27;m trying to see about getting some CLCs with an order we&#x27;re about to place for 30 or so new switches. My rep is saying since this is E-Rate and EDU purchases, CLCs would be considered a &quot;gift&quot; which would present a problem and she is very hesitant on doing this for us.
 Is this bullshit? Is there anyone in K12 that managed to get CLCs under these circumstances?
 I do know a previous employee was successfully able to get CLCs with EDU orders. I&#x27;m wondering if I should try to escalate this issue or fight it.
 I&#x27;m also not sure what the &quot;problem&quot; of a gift would be in my situation. This is my first gig in K12 so I&#x27;m not sure how this is supposed to work in these environments.

                              <span>We currently have an expensive fiber loop linking our 3 campuses (10gig links between sites, 2gb internet) and we&#x27;re exploring more affordable options. We&#x27;re hardly using the links right now, on a heavy day the internet interface gets 1-2% usage at peak and the loop even less than that. we&#x27;re an msp that services about 2-2500 people. 
 obviously visiting msp/isp sites will tell you they&#x27;re the best. i assume leasing fiber somewhere else will be just as expensive. before we went this route we used switched ethernet. it was a 1gb link all around and it was adequate and no fiber leasing involved. beyond that i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s a good (us) solution. Anyone gone through a similar scenario lately and have some advice to share?

                              <span>Basically the best practice in our &quot;world&quot; has been devote 3 AZ&#x27;s where A and B are HA and stood up with a hot ready C in case A or B get devastated. 
 The problem now is I&#x27;m incorporating GWLB&#x27;s and TGW into our set up and I haven&#x27;t fully tested if a &quot;hot standby&quot; endpoint would work in C for the GWLB.
 I&#x27;m at the moment, kinda opposed to having a C because I haven&#x27;t heard of an entire AZ outage, but obviously need the data to support and trump my &quot;anecdotal&quot; experience.
 Anyone have some solid data?

 I would like to know the best solution to monitor configuration changes on Cisco equipment. We have a networking team with multiple network admins and all of them make changes to the network throughout the day. I would like to find a monitoring tool that isn’t too resource intensive to know what changes are being made to our equipment. Any suggestions on what tools would help? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m designing the network for a new production plant. I have a doubt how protect the servers network. Would be enough to segredate the servers in a dedicated VLAN routed on the core switch and configure in each server Windows firewall instead of route all the traffic in/out in the hardware firewall used also as perimter firewall?
 Could have sense put the firewall hardware on the top of the windows firewall?
 Should I monitoring with snort the traffic throught the server network?
 The company have normal network usage, internet, file share and applications based on SQL server. The invironment is fully virtualized on VmWare Esx.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi all. This is probably bordering on a rule 6 violation for you guys but I really have researched the hell out of this one and I&#x27;m getting conflicting info.
 I&#x27;ve been leased ipv4 subnets with a LOA. I want to lease these subnets to another party. I want to prevent the other party from discovering the source of my lease and cutting me out (yes, I am I middleman). The other party knows how to do an ARIN whois. Is this possible?
 If I announce these subnets on my provider&#x27;s ASN would that be enough?

The leaf switches are in vpc but ports connecting to esxi hosts are orphan ports(compute team says something like lacp cannot be configured as per accepted design with customer). We are doing some kind of validation testing for new DC being build, the issue is when we shut down leaf SW1 the esxi hosts are reachable but when the leaf SW1 comes back again, the esxi hosts goes unreachable for about 90-120 secs. Then hosts becomes reachable. Not sure why. Does anyone aware of this issue and know why this is happening?

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I&#x27;m an apprentice network technician and I have to help improve the infrastructure of the organization where I work, which is mainly composed of Aruba CX Switch and HP ProCurve. I had the thought to use Spanning Tree, and I made a lot of tests on network simulation software like EVE-NG , but I don&#x27;t have a lot of knowledge about this protocol , and despite having consulted guides , articles , and ChatGPT , I still have some questions with no answers : 
 ​
 - It is possible to deploy STP on a mesh topology , or a topology where nodes are connected to each others with numerous links ? ( I&#x27;m asking this because i want to make STP work on a model with 4 switches, where each switch have a direct link with the others 3 ).
 - How much control do we have in the creation in the logical path made by STP ? ( I would like to know the main ways to designate a port as &quot;designated&quot;, &quot;root&quot; or &quot;alternate&quot; role ) 
 - is it a good idea to use &quot;loop-protect&quot; command in addition of STP commands ? 
 ​
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m clear enough , but if you have any tip to propose , I will be very grateful.

                              <span>When configuring a VPN gateway what is the functional difference between a split tunnel vs only including specific routes? Is it as simple as with a split tunnel DNS makes the decisions about routing? I&#x27;m trying to understand the limitations of PaloAlto&#x27;s include GP licences which does not allow split tunnel but you can limit which routes the client direct toward the VPN. I am willing to admit that I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of these concepts if so please feel free to point that out and nudge me in the right direction.

                              <span>Hey there, 
 I&#x27;ve got a few networks which I&#x27;m planning to mirror to a different location.
 I got about 6 Hubs which are currently connected to one Spoke. 
 Each Hub does have 2 active links which are connected to Spoke via Layer2. On top ECMP and OSPF
 Now I rented a bit of space in a nearby DC. 
 ​
 DR is a Fortigate and all Hubs are connected also on a clustered Fortigate.
 ​
 I&#x27;d like to get a Link between HQ A and DC. I only get a single VLAN ID, so Transparent Layer2 wont be possible. So I need Layer3.
 ​
 Now I need to set an alternative Route to those now resisiding in HQ A to create some sort of Disaster Recovery Zone
 Can somebody point me in the right direction?

 Is there anywhere that I can find a side-by-side report showing reliability etc?
 Thanks for any help?

                              <span>I’ve asked for IPSLA (RTT) to be enabled on the WAN links so that I can collect the data in with snmp. Senior tech (CCIE) says that IPSLA is only to be used in an incident / troubleshooting situation and not to be running all the time. 
 Is this right?
 I don’t know how else to build historical information as to our wan performance. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey, I recently got a new laptop for school and I noticed that while it does connect to the internet, I am getting weird errors. It usually is something like &quot;This website uses HSTS, We cannot connect...&quot; for many websites, not all. Some of them give me &quot;security errors&quot; I also straight up cannot connect to some websites too. I asked my admin, who simply said to use school administered laptops, which isnt an option for my film production class as chromebooks are ass for editing videos, as you might guess...
 My networking knowledge is very limited, so let me know what it could be or what steps I could take to more closely diagnose the issue, because right now im unsure what the problem is to research.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working in Cisco TAC for some time now, and also have been lurking here for around a similar time frame. Honestly, even though I work many late nights trying to solve things on my own, I love my job. I am constantly learning and trying to put my best into every case. When I don&#x27;t know something, I ask my colleagues, read the RFC or just throw it in the lab myself and test it. I screw up sometimes and drop the ball, but so does anybody else on a bad day.
 I just want to genuinely understand why some people in this sub dislike or outright hate Cisco/Cisco TAC. Maybe it&#x27;s just me being young, but I want to make a difference and better myself and my team. Even in my own tech, there are things I don&#x27;t like that I and others are trying to improve. How can a Cisco TAC engineer (or any TAC engineer for that matter) make a difference for you guys and give you a better experience?

                              <span>Firstly I am always the one person adopting new versions of everything, running the insiders and previews etc and generally like most changes.
 I’ve been checking out the new outlook edge dev, outlook , teams and teamviewer and I have to say…what in the fuck? The new outlook appears to be the web client of outlook and other sorts of general fuckery. Not enjoying it at all, teams not so bad but they have stripped out some settings it seems.
 Am I the old guy over the fence? Surely I can’t be

                              <span>The other engineer quit at my company, we are still on the upswing of a major Dr incident. Me and my boss had an abrasive conversation today about hours expectation with only me left on the systems side until the other guy is replaced and he said we should regroup tomorrow and discuss further. I was professional, he acted taken aback sand said the expectation was always that we are working 50-55 hours on average (I asked specifically in my interview and was told 40-45) he also said that he has never had an engineer push bsck before. . I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m at any risk of being fired, and if i pushed back really hard they&#x27;d pretty much have to go with it within reason at this point. 
 I&#x27;ve seen some people reference court cases where engineers/admins have gone back and got paid out for overtime because they aren&#x27;t in a &quot;creative&quot; or &quot;manager&quot; role. I&#x27;m not looking to necessarily sue my employer at this point, just go hourly. I&#x27;m sick of working extra for free and want to be able to back my case for going hourly at least for now.
 Side note, I&#x27;m actively looking for other jobs and don&#x27;t intent to be hear another year let alone 3 months.

Something simple to even give to a Lead/Manager or helpdesk person to keep an eye on from time to time... any suggestions? I&#x27;ve tried cockpit.. but that is one machine at a time. Looking at CheckMK, not sure it has a great dashboard for something like that.... other ideas that are open source/free?

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin - I&#x27;m trying to propose a new strategy for our laptop lifecycle in a 99% Mac shop. I know the common/standard advice is 3-4 years, but I&#x27;ve also seen articles/experiments that suggest even 2 years is a significant upgrade to productivity. However, I don&#x27;t know if that makes a lot of sense with a Mac shop - they tend to age fairly well, and unless a major hardware update comes along (like the switch from Intel to ARM processors) I&#x27;m having a hard time justifying the cost of replacing a fully functional 2020-2021 M1 laptop.
 What are your thoughts on this? Are there reports on productivity metrics for a certain cadence of Mac replacements specifically? The only ones I&#x27;ve seen seem to be centered on Windows.

 At my company, the Legal team asked us to NOT format computers, so we can´t re-assign computers from people that left the company. We dont know how long it will be this way, so I was looking for a solution. 
 Do you know of any tool that could save an image of the computer (both windows and mac) in a way that would still be valid for an external auditor / court? 
 Have you dealt with something like this before? 
 Any input is welcome!

 Don&#x27;t laugh, but my current workflow is to use Snipping Tool, then open the image in MS Paint, then mark it up. There&#x27;s got to be an easier way to do this, as it&#x27;s tedious and MS Paint&#x27;s markup sucks.
 What FOSS does this group like to quickly take screenshots, crop, outline, draw arrows, provide steps, and edit images in other ways?

                              <span>Today our NPS RADIUS server for BYOD users is experiencing problems, although the event logs say it is allowing users access, there are a bunch of EapHost related errors suggesting it is failing to be able to negotiate the encryption. Are there any recent Windows Update issues or &quot;kabooms&quot; that might cause this result? Our NPS server is currently Windows Server 2012 R2.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Rebooting the server
 Requesting a new certificate and applying this to all the Policies in NPS (the existing certificate was externally trusted and still valid, but it was suggested I should try a new one anyway)
 Checking TLS settings are still set correctly (TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2)
 Performed a packet capture between one of our APs and the NPS server
 Adding a setting of 1344 for Framed-MTU - this was showing as…</span>

                              <span>Hey all. 
 ​
 Hoping you can help. I have a laptop that i need to be able to access an access database. The access database is in our office and the laptop will be going home with a director. This is the first time WFH has come up as its a fabrication plant. 
 What&#x27;s the easiest/most reliable way to do this do you think? We can spend some money if needs be but it&#x27;s an infrequent ask so I dont want a huge spend profile. 
 The access DB is on a NAS so I could enable remote access but the users IT skills are low so I don&#x27;t want a complex solution. They could probably get a RDP session but that feels clunky especially on a 14&quot; laptop 
 ​
 TIA

Currnetlly out CA polocy only allows access from USA. However somtimes we will open up a whole country for example Mexico for one person to have access. Is there anyway to limit it to just the user? So were not allowing anything from mexico to login just the end user.

                              <span>This is something that may have been covered already if so, I apologize.
 My company has roughly 400 employees and 3 IT staff and I&#x27;m the only one who works on any of the O365 management, and I&#x27;m looking for some advice here. We recently went with KnowBe4 for security training, and we are utilizing the phish alert button. Currently it&#x27;s setup to send an email to our team with an attachment of the email (I think this is the default) but with how many employees we have vs how many people are monitoring and managing it the folder I have them going to is filling up rather fast.
 Does anyone else using this service have any tips or tricks to possibly automating this to grab the header information of the emails using PowerShell or even power automate? This is my first admin job so I am kind of a beginner to power automate and the exchange module in PowerShell. I currently have 250+ emails that are reported as phishing and it seems counter productive to open each one then go into the properties and scroll through the header info to find the domain or IP and block it in exchange. I also know I would need to proof some of them as some people report emails that their bosses send to them lol. 
 I do know in KnowBe4 there is an option if using the add-in via exchange to add header info to the email when reported but that isn&#x27;t working for me for some reason, I also would prefer to learn more on the automation side if possible.
 I know they also have a package you can purchase that would help with this via KnowBe4 but just getting KnowBe4&#x27;s service for a security audit was a nightmare due to an &quot;IT Budget&quot; not existing. 
 ​
 TLDR: Looking for recommendations or pointers in the right direction to automate the KnowBe4 Phish Alert Button to grab the header information from emails that are reported by users and sent to me to help efficiently block them in exchange.

 For example: 
  
CNAME testdata.domain.tld ...
 TXT testdata.domain.tld &quot;This is used for XYZ&quot;
 When I go to enter the TXT record, our DNS host states &quot;testdata.domain.tld has CNAME and Non-CNAME types&quot; and doesn&#x27;t add the TXT record
  
Wondering what others do for TXT descriptors to keep track of what a DNS entry is for (if the entry doesn&#x27;t make visual sense)

 My work acquired a new company and goal is to delete/re-create Outlook profile. When users opens Outlook, they can enter their new company email address. 
 I plan on creating a GPO once this batch file works. 
 I tried the following and works once but not second or third time. Should this work?
 Thank you in advance
 taskkill /IM outlook.exe /f taskkill /IM OneDrive.exe /f reg.exe delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles /f reg.exe add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles\NewMail

 -iSCSI mapped into the fileserver vm?
 Another possibility could be a vhdx in the SAN cluster shared volume, but I would like to use the deduplication feature from the SAN. 
 Thank you for your ideas.

                              <span>I was curious about people&#x27;s experiences with the Safe Attachment feature within Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It appears randomly people will report the attachment either takes extremely long or doesn&#x27;t end up finishing scanning. Now since my few years in IT, I feel like I would always hear this was a thing for Microsoft and this service. To me, it sounds like something out of my control (or anyone of us in this position). I speculate this can result from how the service is running and how many attachments are being filtered by Microsoft at that time. The only possible actions I can either attempt to change my safe attachment setting to send an email upon full scan (which doesn&#x27;t appear to be a thing anymore from what I&#x27;ve seen) or forward the original email yourself to have the email rescanned. I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has tips &amp; tricks on a scenario like this or if my suspicions are right.

                              <span>I was patching Apex One Server from 11564 to 12024 and it got stuck at &quot;Apply iAC server hotfix&quot;.
 Upon checking &quot;C:\TMPatch.log&quot; found that the installer runs a BAT file:
 CreateProcess(Run.bat &quot;-installHF&quot; &quot;C:\Users\Admin2\AppData\Local\Temp\{49C2BAE5-2EBD-4390-A755-93A44A8FDD80}\{647E6202-65EC-4493-8BFA-60816233E08D}\Files\iAC&quot; &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Trend Micro\OfficeScan\PCCSRV\Backup\CriticalPatch_B12024\iAC&quot; &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Trend Micro\OfficeScan\&quot; &quot;1&quot;)
 So just for curiosity I ran the BAT and found it asks :
 Does C:\Program Files (x86)\Trend Micro\OfficeScan\PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\iServicePackage\iAC specify a file name
 or directory name on the target
 (F &#x3D; file, D &#x3D; directory)?
 Answered D then it asked again for another folder, answered D again and this BAT finished upda…</span>

                              <span>Currently not using Apple Business Manager but I do have iOS devices in an MDM. Going to move things to Intune and drop the current MDM. One thing that the old MDM couldn&#x27;t do was automatically upgrade iOS devices. For the current MDM to do that it needed devices to be in the ABM. The current MDM can also control a lot of settings (CIS policy recommendations) but some settings required the devices to be in the ABM so those can&#x27;t be set by it. So to me, it looks like Apple only lets an MDM solution have access to whatever it decides to allow it to manage. Of course that could just be the MDM I&#x27;m using. Now with the move to Intune I&#x27;m being told by the consultant that it can push iOS updates without the ABM being used. Is this true? Also, does Intune have access to all of the iOS settings/controls without the ABM? I would like to be wrong here but I&#x27;d rather get in front of it now if the ABM is needed. Last thing I want is to find out later that I was right and using ABM is necessary to have full control over the apple devices.

                              <span>Most of the tech giants in these days are overwhelmed with the feeling of getting rich much faster. In order to do so, the influencers, who are just showcasing themselves as millionaires are getting into the market by imposing the bad influence about the 9-5 jobs. 
 To be frank, 9-5 jobs or whatever jobs that you are in currently is the right fit for you. You can invest in better assets later and gradually you can increase your income and grow based on the goals. If you are misguided by the concept of getting richer as the car that phases with the jet engine, then you are in a huge misconception. 
 Pursue your education, follow your goals and let your life see the light in its own way. Cheers!

                              <span>A while back, I wrote a DMARC parser in python, with a simple tkinter GUI to help visualize the data better.
 Typically, I allow a week&#x27;s worth of reports to accumulate before throwing them all in the parser and doing a brief analysis.
 This morning, while completing this process, I noticed 3 different reports from different senders were completely empty, except for the word &quot;unused&quot;. Other than that, they appeared to look like regular reports. (Gzipped XML files)
 I couldn&#x27;t find anything related to this when I skimmed the RFC. Does this happen with anyone else or should it be expected? This is the first time it happened after around a year&#x27;s worth of use. (it broke the parser since it didn&#x27;t look like valid XML)

 This host is mainly dedicated for 1 VM (Eclipse) but also has ZVM (Zerto) and vCLS running on it. I have 16 vCPUs / 8 cores per socket running on the Eclipse VM. Another 2 vCPUs / 1 core per socket are dedicated for ZVM and 1 vCPU / 1 core per socket for vCLS.
 We are having performance issues with our Eclipse VM (playing the finger pointing game with their support) and allocating more vCPUs to it has slightly resolved the issue. Am I able to allocate all 20 vCPUs / 10 cores per socket for that VM even though we have the 2 other VMs using up some of those vCPUs?

                              <span>Our HQ is the internet breakout for several satellite sites in multiple countries across Europe. Obviously some of our employees change Google&#x27;s IP address  country association from time to time to their country (we don&#x27;t know who exactly), resulting in wrong currency and language in some search results for the majority of users.
 Does anybody know a way to set the GeoIP location permanently, without non-authorized persons to change it?
 I found only a form to change the IP location that can be used by anybody. The only support contact mail I could find was local to our region and seems to be operated by chatbots :-(

 Your answer could apply to any of these questions: - “What are you working on?” - “What do you do in your job?” - “Why are you trying to escape this mind-numbing chat so quickly?” - “Why do you need to leave early from the meeting-that-should-have-been-an-email?”
 The only one I could think of was from Sim City: “Reticulating splines”.
 Keep it clean please.

                              <span>The latest gross web push from Microsoft sees businesses forced to use Edge for certain links.
 Microsoft Edge is a good browser but for some reason Microsoft keeps trying to shove it down everyone’s throat and make it more difficult to use rivals like Chrome or Firefox. Microsoft has now started notifying IT admins that it will force Outlook and Teams to ignore the default web browser on Windows and open links in Microsoft Edge instead.
 Reddit users have posted messages from the Microsoft 365 admin center that reveal how Microsoft is going to roll out this change. “Web links from Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts and Microsoft (MSA) accounts in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge in a single view showing the opened link side-by-side with the email it came from,” reads a message to IT admins from Microsoft.

                              <span>Hey, I hope it’s okay here to ask a question…I have to make a short presentation about MS Defender Vulnerability Management for my manager and I am quite new in this Field. I read nearly the whole documentation, but I think I am a bit lost atm.
 The main questions are:
 Q: What are the different states of vulnerabilities (open, closed,...) - I can&#x27;t exactly find open, closed and other statuses. Should it be about critical, high based on CVSS or how would you understand the Task ?
 Q: How does MSD mark vulnerabilities as closed? -
 Q:Integration with ServiceNow VR Application and how is a vulnerability item updated ?
 I would really appreciate if someone could give me a short explanation to each answer, so I don&#x27;t get lost since the topic is quite big for a newbie.
 Thanks in advance and have a great day!

                              <span>As we have more and more people working outside of the office we want to start looking towards AAD and Intune for our devices.
 ​
 We&#x27;d like to start by going Hybrid AAD but one thing I&#x27;m hoping it can offer I&#x27;ve not actually seen spelt out so thought I&#x27;d ask here.
 ​
 If you have a device Hybrid AAD Joined can you log into it using your AAD credentials (username@upn) and it will authenticate against AAD or do Hybrid devices still need line of site of a DC? 
 ​
 I ask because the type of ticket that comes up again and again is when a user resets their password and their AAD \ OnPrem password is updated they are still using cached credentials on their device which causes confusion. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m hoping Hybrid AAD would be a way to alleviate this issue but I&#x27;m coming up with squat while researching. Maybe my google-fu is failing me at today :)

                              <span>It&#x27;s been some month we have some random database crashes because of a Linux VPS that sometimes miss RAM and the oom_killer kills the DB because it&#x27;s the most consuming process.
 But to get more informations on what&#x27;s going on I am looking for a reliable way to monitor either the apache multiple virtual hosts I have (monitor them individually) and each DB individually on MariaDB.
 I&#x27;ve been trying Google Analytics, but it don&#x27;t show all requests on a site or the failing requests etc etc... So I was thinking about using Grafana, there is some module I can use with Apache mod_status extended. But this sounds like not really &quot;professional&quot;, it uses a github module to export status on prometheus, and then I have to re-code some part to get the extended status which interests me... Also I saw I can monitor databases with Grafana, so it sounds fine to me. Maybe some of you have good or even better solutions?
 Thanks

 The problem is that the Switch is still running on default Configuration, thus having an IP of 192.168.0.254/24 if I remember correctly. We have a connection to the network there, but it is in the network 10.100.20.xx/24.
 The way we did it before was going there, connecting directly, changing our IP to the Switches Default-Network and connecting that way.

But issue comes when machine goes to lock enabled screensaver after some idle time, the user tries to unlock but it never prompts for PIN though it might say please insert your card. If you manually lock and unlock within a few minutes, it seems to load the smart card module and prompt for PIN then login in. If it&#x27;s been idle for a longer time, it fails to recognize the smart card and user has to reboot machine for it to be recognized again. Reading online the solutions I&#x27;ve come across are using VMware horizon client but I don&#x27;t have licensing or setup for that. The issue is also supposedly fixed in RHEL 8 with a newer version of pcsc-lite. I have also turned on gdm debugging and have seen a few errors regarding account expiration policy not found and the pam_pkcs module failing to load. Not sure why if during initial login it works 100% of the time. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s unreliable USB redirection with the VMware player and card reader so I&#x27;m gonna try installing the image directly on a machine to circumvent using VMware player/workstation software.

                              <span>We have a new user starting with us, he was to have the same access as another who just left.
 One of our guys just renamed a user who just left so access was the same etc, I wondered what everyone&#x27;s take on this is? 
 Do you just rename if the position is like for like or do you create a new user from scratch?

                              <span>Patching is hard.
 ​
 Patching is great for security perspective yet &quot;just patch the systems&quot; is a naive take. In order to keep systems available and secure at the same time, a thorough and working patch management technology (along with people and processes but out of scope of the question here) needs to be manageable, too.
 RHEL has Satellite, Windows has WSUS and so many 3rd parties exist for the ecosystem. If the environment is not fully RHEL, Satellite is not enough. WSUS does not patch 3rd party applications, so we need another solution for that. Also, you need two solutions if you pick the default ones, so a 3rd party looks like better but comes with cost. So many trade-offs.
 Aside from all the marketing online and tools in Google search result first 5 pages, what do you do to solve this puzzle? I mean your experience, by the way, not the names of possible tools only.

                              <span>So I own a small computer repair business and have set up a small lab of six computers along with the computer I would use to teach with so that would make seven. I want to be able to teach people how to install specific software and then roll back the changes perhaps on reset. I know there is software to do this but so far I&#x27;ve tried some of the demos and I&#x27;m not happy with the results. I&#x27;m not super familiar with Windows server as most of my server experience has to do with Linux, is this something I can do with perhaps active directory or other Windows server features I&#x27;m not aware of. I have no problem learning the software and can put as much time into it as needed. I have a VM for Windows server 2022 already running blue iris and some other window specific services. I&#x27;m currently using proxmox on my server at work, but at the moment besides providing some system backups to the NAS the computer lab is currently independent of the server.

                              <span>It appears that ghostscript have decided to disable the silent install option as of GS 10.01.0. Their apparent reasoning is that gs has been bundled with 3rd party software, not kept up to date, and they get grief. Then they say that it&#x27;s trivial to rebuild from source with the silent option enabled. Great, so the 3rd party software providers that compile their own software can easily rebuild the installer and keep bundling gs, but I, with no software compilation skills, can&#x27;t keep it up to date on managed end user&#x27;s PC&#x27;s....
 Sorry rant over.

                              <span>Microsoft recommends decommisioning old DCs and replacing with new, rather than in-place upgrades. This is very quick and simple, but my question is around best practice if your old DC is also your DNS server. DHCP clients are not a problem, but statically configured devices will still reference the old DC IP address as the DNS server. 
 For larger enterprises, I think implementing separate DNS resolvers is likely the best solution, but in the smaller business case I&#x27;m dealing with, continuing to use the DC as the DNS server may be the better solution, so how do I deal with this? E.g.:
  
Should I replace DC with new one at new IP and then manually go and update all statically configured devices decommissioning old DC: possibly very time consuming and easy to miss items
 Set up new DC, demote and decommission old DC and then change new DC&#x27;s IP address to match the old decommissioned DC&#x27;s IP address?
 Something else?

                              <span>After struggling with Comcast and Verizon, I’ve been quoted a decent rate by Crown Castle for 10gig fiber to my Condo building. We would simply charge everyone $100 a month for Internet.
 However, I’m wondering if this is enough for 40 units. Without any shaping or prioritization in place, what happens if a unit decides to download torrents all evening? What if 2-3 people do? 
 Will most network equipment attempt to balance by default or will data simply be dropped and slow to a crawl?

                              <span>Hey Folks,
 Hope you all are doing well. Looking for some help, suggestions, and insights.
 We are in the process of engaging multiple vendors to procure and implement firewalls for our new large medical facility. 
 For internal/data center and perimeter firewalls, specifically, two questions: do we need to use multi-vendors for these firewalls, and if so, which vendor should be used for the perimeter network - Fortinet or Palo Alto?
 We have asked all the vendors about multi-vendor approach for the data center and perimeter, but nobody could give any convincing answer.
 Also, we are considering using Sophos XGS as a Data Center Firewall. Do you have any experience with this product? Is it a good choice for implementing a Data Center Firewall?
 Thank you in advance for your responses.

                              <span>Gents, I’ve screwed up and need to break into the 447 router. I’ve read I need to press the Break button within 60 second of start up (or use the special command for Putty) but neither is worked. Anyone has any other ideas? 
 Apparently the Pacstar 447 is a ESR6300

                              <span>We have a SolarWinds server that is on our internal network. We have it pretty locked down so the only internet access it has is a whitelist of SolarWinds domains so it can update. During some downtime, I decided to look at the Okta setup procedure. I fully expected I would have to open up our firewall policies a bit to get it to work.
 To my surprise it worked with the default configuration. I double checked the FW logs and see no traffic being routed to the internet that isn&#x27;t being allowed by our one URL whitelist rule.
 I am admittedly not experienced with SAML, would this be expected or am I overlooking something with our firewall configuration allowing traffic that we shouldn&#x27;t be? Is it because the user device is forwarding the SAML response?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m a SWE at one of the major companies in the networking industry (working on Layer 3 stuff mostly). I jumped in shortly after graduating and have been working here for ~9 months now.
 I wanted to get some insight from those who started in a similar role or are just in the industry:
  
Where are you now? (Industry, role, company)
 Did you stay in the networking space or pivot to a different industry, and why?
 What advice would you give someone just starting out in the space on what career path to take for best employment prospects and earnings?
 Did you regret starting your career in/staying in networking?
 What is the compensation and attainability of upper-level roles in this industry like compared to others?
 Any specific domain of networking that you recommend specializing in? 
  
I personally enjoy various aspects of my job and learning about the intricacies of networking. However, my worry is that the knowledge I&#x27;m learning is fairly niche and there aren&#x27;t that many companies hiring folks in this industry compared to something like a Backend Developer which virtually every company needs. So I&#x27;m contemplating whether I should pivot to other roles since I&#x27;m still early in my career and won&#x27;t get boxed-in to a specific sector, and was hoping hear some opinions on the above questions to help guide me!

                              <span>Management dropped a pet project in our lap, *first time?.png* To stay on schedule we&#x27;re robbing Peter to pay Paul (dammit Paul you don&#x27;t even work here anymore) with inventory we have on hand. The project needs C9300s stacked in 3s and 4s in various IDFs. We have the 9300s but not the stack kits.
 We cannot wait for stack kits, the lead times exceed the project timeline. The question becomes: &quot;Are the 9300s worth stacking after they&#x27;re already in production?&quot; My OCD screams yes, and it would eliminate some daisychaining in a couple IDFs. However, it would require careful planning and at least one maintenance window per IDF to stack them together. I&#x27;m not sure if the juice is worth the squeeze.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>I ran nmap today on the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet (which we aren’t using.)
 It found four devices. Interestingly, when ran arp -a on my windows laptop, the device at .2 was showing a MAC address of a Unifi device, which is also what nmap said. nmap advised port 22 was open on .2 but there were no ports open for a web server. 
 When I navigated to the IP address I was presented with the login screen of a Zyxel WAP, which I successfully logged into. 
 My working theory is that there are two devices running the same IP and that the laptop has cached the MAC for the Unifi, and as it isn’t running a web server when I navigate to its IP in chrome I am getting the page for the Zyxel. Does that sound correct / plausible?
 If so, I will change the static IP set on the Zyxel and go from there.

                              <span>I have an internal Asset Management/Ticketing software and portal that I&#x27;d like to make available externally. I&#x27;ve only ever done this with locally hosted exchange servers. The actual process of configuring the NAT I get, but I&#x27;m concerned about the security implications. The portal itself is password protected against AD creds and uses a single port on the host VM server. I don&#x27;t plan on adding it to our public DNS instead having managed machines access it via link posted on their desktops. Any ACLs I would need to put in place to block other traffic?
 Since locally hosted Exchange servers basically do the same thing, except with published DNS, so I can&#x27;t imagine there would be too much to consider, but I&#x27;d certainly rather be safe than sorry.

                              <span>I thought about putting this in the fortinet sub but it’s more around network routing…
 We have a couple of sites, each with multiple pairs of Fortigate firewalls with various vDOMs configured. Each vDOM has one or more vlan interfaces which carry client LAN, DMZ, DB networks etc, and there’s a WAN interface too. These are all connected to a common edge stack with the necessary vlan IDs allowed on the switchports.
 If we wanted a VM on vlan 101 which is served by FGT pair 1, to access a VM on vlan 201 which is served by pair 2, currently we would set up a vlan interface for vlan 101 on FGT pair 2 with say 10.10.101.253 as the IP, and a static route on pair1 for 10.10.201.0/24 via 10.10.101.253.
 This is starting to get a bit unmanageable and I want to look at setting up dynamic routing acr…</span>

                              <span>Hello. It is my understanding, from the manufacturer data sheets, that the Adtran NetVanta 1550 series switches, and specifically the 1550-24 model, will support 10Gbps fiber SFP modules. Although this is a older series of switches, we have a large number of them. I was wondering if anyone is actually running that 10Gbps configuration, and if you have had good success, problems or other advice as we consider how to go from our existing 1Gbps backbone to 10Gbps. Thank you.

                              <span>I apologize in advance for my novice level of knowledge in Networking.
 I&#x27;m building a small server rack and in looking for RJ45 couplers I&#x27;ve seen some listed as CAT5e, CAT6, CAT7 etc,. I was under the impression that CATx was in reference to a standard for the cables themselves rather than the connector. I suspect it has to do with the shielding but I wanted to check with the pros.
 I have attempted to search for the answer online without success.
 Example: If I&#x27;m using CAT8, connecting to a rack coupler that&#x27;s labeled as CAT5e will there be a significant drop in performance? Or does the coupler itself not impact the performance as long as the cables themselves (on both ends of the coupler) are up to the CAT8 standards?

 We are looking to have a https wildcard certificate secured guest portal with employee sponsorship with CoA vlan change so they don’t have to switch SSIDs once approved.
 We are also looking for a similar portal for BYOD where employees log in with their azure AD creds and get a CoA to a BYOD vlan once authenticated.
 We have tried XMC-SE/NAC, A3 and now Cisco ISE. We keep having issues with redirecting and difference in action based on the client depending on if using HTTPS, HTTP or FQDN. We’ve also had issues with CoA not working with ISE. We’ve purchased consulting hours through extreme and Cisco and aren’t having much luck.
 Curious if anyone has gotten this working and what products and methods you use?

                              <span>Hello, all. I have a legacy OTV environment that I am troubleshooting as there are connectivity issues, While reviewing the configuration I noticed a pattern in the OTV overlay instances. Here is an example:
 service instance 998 ethernet
 encapsulation dot1q 998
 mac access-group filter_fhrp out
 bridge-domain 998
 Looking at the documentation, I see this being configured as an in-bound filter, not as the out-bound filter like in the config &quot; mac access-group filter_fhrp out&quot;. Why might this be configured as an outbound filter?
 Here is a simple topology example. The OTV configuration exists on A-CR01 &amp; B-CR01. An example of an issue is reachability to the internet from hosts connected to B-CS01. A-CS01 is the only device with internet access.
 A-CS01 ---&gt; A-CR01  B-CR01 &lt;--- B-CS01

                              <span>This seems like it should have a simple answer, but I&#x27;ve done that many Google searches that Google stopped me to make sure I was human, and there wasn&#x27;t a simple answer amongst all the searches I tried.
 If I have a NPS/Packetfence/Clearpass/FreeRadius running in a VM(HyperV) and I have a single 802.1x capable switch and I want port auth on every port on the switch including the one that NPS is running from, how do I deal with the NPS authorising itself?
 This sounds right but seems wrong: is it as simple as having a management VLAN that the switch can talk to NPS on and that VLAN in HyperV NIC for that VM is either tagged/untagged so that the switch can communicate without needing to authorise itself? 
 That still seems flawed if someone knew the VLAN ID albeit minimal access would be possible in it(1812,1813 exposed at most I would have thought)

 But it’s very outdated now. Now we have MTO/MTP, Channelization (break-out) 100Gbps to 25Gbps, 40Gbps to 10Gbps, etc. The ins and outs of MTO/MTP.. type A vs type B polarity, male vs female, patch panel break out panel… it’s all extremely complex and difficult to get straight.
 This would be an extremely valuable post!

                              <span>What lead times for switching/routing gear are you seeing at the moment?
 It seems that things are improving across the board so wanted to check what hardware delivery lead times people are getting. 
 I’m particularly interested in Cisco, Juniper and Arista.

 Anyone know a really working VPN in China?
 Some of my european colleagues must go for business trip in China and must communicate with our office and ERP.
 I need the best reliable VPN cause our IT Dpt cannot contact the colleagues if VPN doesn&#x27;t work.
 I have read about Astrill that it&#x27;s good and working in China.
 Some advise?
 There is something better and reliable?
 There is also private corporate IpSec tunnel allowed from China to out?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a bit of time at work right now, as I am waiting on our service providers. 
 Since I&#x27;m the only one in IT and I have no documentation from my predecessor, I&#x27;d like to get more involved with our Firewalls.
 Couldn&#x27;t really find good ressources, do you have any tips? I thought about setting up a Firewall (pfsense) try around there, but I&#x27;d like to understand the fundamentals more (drop, deny, accepts, setting rules etc).
 Thank you for any guidance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am currently experiencing a weird networking issue at work. Link at the bottom for abstracted architecture.
 We have two ISPs and two firewalls in different buildings.
 The ISP Routers are connected to a switch, whose only purpose is to connect both Firewalls (Fortigate) to the ISP router in case of firewall failure.
 Outgoing traffic gets replies that are properly handled by the firewall (doesn&#x27;t seem to be a L1-L3 problem on the side of the ISP).
 Incoming traffic however does not get handled properly - Pings from WAN to the interface do not receive a reply, Port forwarding does not work either. On the other interface the configuration is the same but it works.
 When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP1s network (1.1.1.2), there is no reply.
 When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP2s network (2.2.2.1), there is a reply.
 When capturing network traffic on switch 1 (traffic on the interfaces that are connected to the firewalls, both directions) i can see that the ping request gets sent to the active firewall. There is no reply though.
 When i plug a laptop into the switch 1 and give it the IP address of the router (1.1.1.1, no further addresses available sadly) i get a reply to the ping.
 The firewalls are fortigates, they are configured as active/active but from what i&#x27;ve gathered only the primary firewall handles traffic, the secondary firewall gets used to offload security processing.

 Any ideas what i could look into further?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>We have an odd intermittent fault happening where all devices connected to our either our 2nd or 3rd switch becomes un routable. The only way to fix it is to change the wan connection to a port on the broken switch and then back again. Anyone had this before?
 Can ping all logical addresses. Have rebuilt the VSS stack multiple times using the VSS cisco guide. No interface errors No output log errors

However I noticed a good handful of them are blinking a steady amber at the exact same time and in unison. The end devices connected to those ports seem like they&#x27;re fine, but I don&#x27;t have a clue as to why they&#x27;re showing a different visual indication than the rest. Any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying for Nokia&#x27;s NRS II certification and am taking their IS-IS practice exam. I ran into a question I got wrong, but I can&#x27;t understand why the answer they give is correct. Can anyone explain why C is the correct answer to this?
 Here&#x27;s my thought process:
  
A is false because the L1 LSP includes all subnets directly attached to the router itself, not the entire area.
 B is false because the L1 LSP wouldn&#x27;t include subnets advertised by R6 since it&#x27;s in another area.
 C is the correct answer, but I thought the L2 LSP included all subnets attached to routers in the area in which the L1/L2 router resides (which is why I chose D), not just itself.
  
Their own lab guide for this exam has this statement for the section where you configure a multi-area topology which seems to contradict this question: &quot;display the details of the level-2 LSP advertised by your P router. Observe that it only includes level-2 capable neighbors in its topology information and that it includes all the area subnets in its IP reachability information, not just the subnets that are directly attached to it.”

 I work for an investment fund that is small in terms of people, but we manage a reasonable amount of assets and we&#x27;re buying/selling publicly traded securities, so having our internet be rock-solid is important. We are currently using Spectrum HFC in our office and we&#x27;ve been pretty unhappy with speeds and uptime. All of our computers are on a VPN that is Arizona based, and we will often have 3 - 4 people with Bloomberg terminals open, downloading medium-sized files from our file system (i.e., via the VPN) while on Zoom calls. There are ~10 people in the office at any given time.

 Our users are experiencing voice issues from hard phones, whether the handset, headset, or speaker is being used, call quality is cutting in and out, sometimes there&#x27;s static, sometimes robotic, other times it&#x27;s &#x27;like the caller is underwater.&#x27;
 We have about 50 sites and each site has anywhere between 5-50 users, based on the size of the site. 
 I currently have about 5 of the bigger sites, ranging between 25-50 users complaining about voip problems. Phone calls cutting in and out, not being able to hear the caller. 
 Please note: We don&#x27;t manage our own Voip solution, that&#x27;s outsourced to an MSP, the MSP says it&#x27;s not them, when they request call examples and listen to the pcaps they come back clear. 
 While each site is different …</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I know very little about Metro Ethernet. So for those of you who have experience with this, I was wondering why (if both are offered by a Provider) one would ever select an E-Line service instead of an E-LAN service? From a quick glance, it would seem that E-LAN is much more scalable if you need to connect future remote offices. Is there a huge difference in the cost or something? I also don&#x27;t know why anyone would ever select E-Tree over E-LAN. Thanks in advance for any insight you can offer!

                              <span>After a recent windows update that got pushed our devices started using teredo tunneling adapter for some traffic out to microsoft. If we disable the adapter through GPO is there any website out there that absolutely 100% actually requires ipv6/teredo tunneling that this would effect? As it is we are blocking teredo traffic that is not going out to microsoft on our firewall but it would be easier if we could just turn it off altogether.

                              <span>Hey guys, I have a few questions regarding routing and firewall rules with the UDMP and unifi gateway products.
 We have a large 172.30.x.x /17 network with each site having a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro and being allocated a /21 subnet. Our AWS VPC network is 172.31.x.x/16.
 Routing between sites is handled via IPSEC vpn tunnels to a VyOS router in AWS EC2. This facilitates routing between each /21 and the 172.31.x.x networks.
 I am confused about how the firewall rules are supposed to be setup in Unifi network.
 I want to allow all traffic from 172.30.x.x/17 and 172.31.x.x/16 to go in and out of each other UDMP, as well as ping each other&#x27;s WAN interfaces. I&#x27;ve created a group on each UDMP containing these networks/subnets, to be used to apply to each rule&#x27;s &quot;address group&quot;.
 How many rules do I need to apply? and on which interfaces? (WAN OUT, WAN IN, WAN LOCAL, LAN IN, LAN OUT, LAN LOCAL). This is a simple configuration that is made difficult in my head due to all the various directoins and interfaces.
 Next question, there&#x27;s a radio button to &quot;don&#x27;t match on IPSEC traffic&quot; when creating rules. Do I want this checked or not? All of the connections between sites are IPSEC tunnels, all inter-site traffic will be traversing an IPSEC tunnel. This is made even more confusing with the 3 options:&quot;Don&#x27;t match on IPSEC traffic&quot;&quot;Match inbound IPSEC traffic&quot;&quot;Match inbound non-IPSEC traffic&quot;
 Any insight would be appreciated. I would appreciate it if only those who have direct experience working with this exact interface would respond. I understand the idea and fundamentals of how this is supposed to work, however when applying rules the outcome isn&#x27;t as you would expect. So I want to know the &quot;proper&quot; or &quot;intended&quot; way that these options are supposed to be used.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m having some trouble setting in a Fortigate IPsec VPN in Azure. We&#x27;ve had the Fortigate NVA set up with HA in Azure for years (set up by others, not me).
 ​
 I need to set up an IPsec VPN so users can remotely connect into the environment. I cannot use the Azure VPN at this moment due to it being used for other reasons and it has a very restrictive NSG on its subnet.
 I followed the article here (https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/5.6.0/cookbook/589121/ipsec-vpn-with-forticlient) yet I&#x27;m not able to connect via the client. I get this error when trying to connect:
 ​
 VPN connection failed. Please check your configuration and network connection, then retry your connection. If the problem persists, contact your network administrator for help. 
 In my VPN client config I&#x27;m using a public IP from the load balancer. There are two load balancing rules to map UDP ports 500 and 4500 to the backend (the two Fortigate VMs in HA). 
 If I run the command below I can see my client is trying to connect:
 diagnose sniffer packet any &quot; host myclientip and port (500 or 4500)&quot; 4 0 l Using Original Sniffing Mode interfaces&#x3D;[any] filters&#x3D;[ host 142.113.161.68 and port (500 or 4500)] 2023-05-02 19:14:04.734193 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:07.870742 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:07.870746 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:10.910803 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:10.910806 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:13.937669 sriovslv0 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 2023-05-02 19:14:13.937672 port1 in myclientip.500 -&gt; azurelbip.500: udp 508 
 I&#x27;m at a loss of what to check next. Any guidance or assistance would be very much appreciated.

                              <span>I am trying to get the received/sent byte fields from Netflow from our Meraki MX67. I saw a similar question to this online but that&#x27;s because they were using v5 and only v9 sends output messages.
 Anyone have any luck with Logstash and getting that field?
 My current output looks like below:

 This is my config file for Logstash
 input { udp { port &#x3D;&gt; 2055 codec &#x3D;&gt; netflow { versions &#x3D;&gt; [9] } } } output { # Output events that match the filters to stdout stdout { codec &#x3D;&gt; rubydebug } # Output to a local file { path &#x3D;&gt; &quot;loggingforme.txt&quot; codec &#x3D;&gt; rubydebug } }

                              <span>Our edge routers currently do not have an ACL on their internet-facing interfaces. These are our internet edge routers which run eBGP with our ISPs. I&#x27;m trying to research best practices for this ACL.
 I&#x27;m on an ASR1K. Here is my latest draft:
 ip access-list extended INET permit icmp any any echo-reply # Only allow responses to ICMP echo initiated internally permit tcp any any established # Allow TCP traffic for sessions initiated internally permit ip  any # Allow our other DCs to freely communicate with each other permit tcp any any eq 179 # Allow BGP peering permit tcp any eq 179 any # Allow BGP peering deny any any 
 I&#x27;m concerned about adding this ACL as the ASR1K is not a stateful device. Therefore, I think it will drop return UDP packets. This is highly concerning as we use UDP-based applications extensively. Due to UDP being a connection-less protocol, there is no such thing as permit udp any any established.
 Can anyone suggest best practices for an ACL like this? Is there a document from a major vendor with examples? How do ISPs handle this scenario? I&#x27;m struggling to find relevant resources on Google.

                              <span>I hope this isn&#x27;t too low level for the sub, but I do need a sanity check here.
 I have to automate a few facilities with IoT gear. The best solution I found is based on using specific hardware from China to gather the data and control devices.
 As &quot;server&quot; I have a small Beelink machine, which should work just fine for the task. The communication is over MQTT.
 Now, the CEO is worried that there may be adversarial code on those devices and wants me to ensure everything is safe.
 Initially I thought I could just cut those devices off from the Internet at the router/firewall. 
 Lying in bed tonight at 2h30am I figured I could also just have two physical networks. One for the hardware I/O and one that communicates with our server on the web. Were not running centrifuges here. The motivation for an elaborate attack should be minimal.
 The on-site server would then need two NICs. It has one ethernet on board and maybe get another via USB or use Wifi.
 This seemed like a good idea at first, but then I remembered a story from way back when in the 90s.
 I worked for a large company that had large banks as their clients. One of my colleagues was the blessed one that had a direct network connection into one of those banks besides the one into the local network.
 However for some reason that I don&#x27;t remember his computer acted as router between those two networks. Obviously that shit got shut down real quick once the banks IT department caught wind of it.
 Is this something unavoidable or can I reliably configure this possibility away? The server runs on Debian.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have a client that is implementing a new DR site, he wants to recreate all the same subnets that he has in HQ exactly as it is in DR with the same gateway even the same Public IP for online pubished services. He has that idea in mind to do a seamless failover in case something wrong went to the VM without any manual intervention. Is this really possible. What are the side backs and the cons if any. I should mention that this client is an ISP so he controls the mpls network between the sites

                              <span>I am trying to implement a camera system for my father&#x27;s store. The issue is they want to be able to check the cameras remotely but the system (Toguard W300) they bought does not allow this. 
 My plan is to set up an old laptop and have that streaming out the security video. Does anyone know of a website that would allow a sign in to view stream? Or a different subreddit to ask this in if my question doesn&#x27;t fit here? 
 I contemplated port forwarding the camera access ports but nothing in the documentation says if this will work or not.

 In this example my ASN is 65444 and my upstream is 65443. I plan on moving to another host and having them both live at the same time lets use 65442 as the new provider, how can I set it so that when both are live my old upstream 65443 will stop routing my IP ranges and 65442 will be the priority route. I beleive I can do this with prepend but I am not sure how the config should look on both ends.

                              <span>Hey folks, so was recently upgrading from UniFi to Aruba AP 515 for one of our client. During that in initial setup we choose country, after choosing India the APs decided to just not broadcast any SSID whatsoever spent my entire evening troubleshooting that. Turns out 510series has some country code issue. 
 So is it the device fault OR that particular model isn’t supported in my region? Very curious to know the RC.

The idea is to pass access management of folders or teams off to department leaders for Managment. I see this being a disaster from a management standpoint as a system administrator. Wondering if anyone here has every completely dropped files servers and moved over to teams. How did it go?

                              <span>Dear fellow SysAdmins,
 Despite having left my previous toxic position near my house, I encountered an unexpected setback at my new job. I had given my previous employer two weeks&#x27; notice and was due to start at a client of an MSP company on May 1st. However, the start date was postponed to May 15th due to unforeseen circumstances.
 I have received news that the new MSP company that I would have been working at, is shutting down and they will no longer be able to offer me the position. As a result, I am now without a job and must begin the job hunt anew.
 I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or advice that you all may have on what I should do in the meantime. Furthermore, I have a legal question regarding the employment agreement letter that I signed. As a resident of the NYC area, I am wondering if there are any laws that protect my rights in this situation, pay wise, or if I am out of luck.
 Thank you all for your time and assistance.

                              <span>Our Network Engineering team is rolling out new subnets for most locations, and the range of address space they’re choosing is 172.32.x/24, 172.33.x/24, etc. They’re up to 172.44.x.x now, I think, and quite a few have been rolled out.
 I think they just didn’t realize that the RFC 1918 class B network range ends at 172.31.255.255, and now we’ve got public ip ranges inside our corporate network and are seeing various kinds of issues like excess prompts to authenticate to cloud providers. I asked about the ranges used for the new subnets and got a “Cisco said it’s OK,” in response so all I’ve done is indicate that I think it merits looking into, but no one’s looked into it. 
 Have any of you heard about the range 172.32.0.0-172.44.255.255 being used internally for private addressing? I’ve seen it done before, but only out of ignorance, and correcting it is always painful. Everything I’ve read and heard from past coworkers says this is a very bad thing to do, but the people doing it now disagree, and they’re VERY confident they’re right. Which is a little terrifying.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>A quick story for you. I just found myself on the wrong side of some malicious compliance. For years, I&#x27;ve had issues with Dell support. I&#x27;m sure we all have. My particular issue stems from their refusal to contact me via email. They always call. I don&#x27;t WANT a phone call. Chances are I&#x27;m working on a different issue, on a different call, my mind&#x27;s on another task, and I don&#x27;t want to just drop everything. Especially if we&#x27;re talking about a Sev3 or so where I just need a little guidance. Email&#x27;s great, I can wrap up my current thought and then pivot to the support request.
 Since I can&#x27;t get them to stop calling, and I&#x27;m tired of simply ignoring their call and then responding to the ticket as though I didn&#x27;t notice, I wanted to force the issue. You can&#x27;t remove your phone number entirely - it wants numbers in that box. But, it turns out the box isn&#x27;t cross referencing with telco providers to ensure the phone numbers are legitimate. So a couple months I put some nonsense in there which would make it flatly impossible to call me, and promptly forgot I&#x27;d ever done so. Yeah you probably see this conclusion coming.
 Last Monday I opened an SR, and as the week dragged on, the silence started to grow more suspicious. By this morning it was clear that my SR had landed in the wrong queue, so I pull up the support site to check the status of the SR. Closed due to lack of customer contact because they were unable to reach me on the phone. I mean, of course you were unable to reach me, you can&#x27;t dial 111-111-1111, it&#x27;s simply not a thing. What the bloody hell list did I end up on where these people will not just email me? I&#x27;m leaving the number in there, I guess I&#x27;ll just CC every account exec I&#x27;ve ever crossed paths with on every SR from now on with &quot;My preferred method of contact is by email&quot; pasted between every paragraph of every ticket I submit.
 Ahh Dell, you useless, useless company.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve implemented a new help system at my place of employment after a merger and I&#x27;m trying to coach my new users on putting in tickets correctly. I originally hid the option to select a priority when submitting a ticket but now that I have people putting in emergency requests that are not emergencies, I&#x27;ve decided to unhide priority, but I already have users putting all of their tickets in as high priority, even though they aren&#x27;t. 
 Other than warning people about the boy who cried wolf (i.e., if all of your tickets are high priority, we will start treating them as if they aren&#x27;t and the one time you actually do need help quickly, you won&#x27;t get it and it&#x27;s all your fault), what&#x27;s the best way to communicate this to your users? Or have you had any luck at all with this?

                              <span>I work in a medium-sized organization running a hybrid environment. Our ticketing system is AD synced so when a user locks themselves out of their company account, they must call the help desk to unlock the account. My question is how do you verify your user&#x27;s identity when they call for account unlocks?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to find some correlating events to understand why we had some users have their user profiles nuked overnight and this morning. 
 We had probably 20-30 users now reporting that logging in this morning was like logging into a fresh computer. This doesn&#x27;t appear to be a normal corrupt profile situation, their profile was deleted and created fresh upon login. 
 Sometime overnight you can see the EventID 1 from Search-ProfileNotify saying the Windows Search Service indexed data for the user and it was successfully removed in response to user profile deletion. When they login you see a similar event that their profile is being created. What I&#x27;m trying to figure out is what in the world would have caused this request to happen. Are there no event ID&#x27;s tied to a requested profile deletion or what triggered it?
 No Windows updates were deployed this week either. Basically looking for any advice that might lead me down a breadcrumb trail to figuring out what in the world happened. And also why it only effected this small amount of users.

                              <span>The short-short version of the story is that my new PowerEdge R650 servers came with the System Profile Setting &quot;Performance-Per-Watt (DAPC)&quot; which refers to the Dell Active Power Controller. With DAPC in control of CPU frequency scaling the cpufreq driver would not load and I was stuck at the base CPU speeds. The fix is to change the System Profile to Performance and let the OS control CPU frequency scaling. This unlocks OS control of CPU turbo speeds and gave me an instant 1 GHz boost per core.
 The dev team will be pleased that the new servers are no longer 30% slower than the rest of the fleet.

                              <span>Hello Everyone!
 I was recently having a conversation with a coworker, regarding PTO in IT. In this instance, when I refer to PTO, I am also referring to sick leave, and vacation time, just not holiday pay. We were discussing how many days the average (full-time, 9-5, Mon-Fri) IT person needs in order to maintain a healthy work/life balance. I’m thinking 15 days is a good average, and my coworker is thinking something closer to 20, but we would love to get more opinions on the matter.
 As a follow up to that, what would be the minimum PTO/Sick Leave/Vacation time package you would accept from a prospective new employer?
 ​
 EDIT: Every person is different, and answering this kind of question can be tricky considering the different needs of different people, for the sake of this discussion, I am mainly referring to averages, to make it somewhat easier to answer. I also wanted to put a disclaimer here that I am not saying everyone should be able to make 15 days work for them, but just on average that is what most people probably would need to maintain a healthy work/life balance. Absolutely nothing wrong with needing more than that, or less than that in my opinion.

                              <span>Heya, 
 First a bit of a disclaimer, I do sysadmin just part time in a small firm of 15 ish employees and don&#x27;t have much of a background in it other than being the only one here able to distinguish an .exe from a .pdf... 
 Discovered some weird logins on our exchange online to one account but originating in another country. After some password resets and talking to the user it seemed fine but then the third party were in again a few hours later. By now I figured my users computer was fucked and we took it offline while locking and/or resetting all their various accounts. Problem solved.
 Today when I got my hands on the computer I found the following:
 - Email received from a domain we generally trust (so they got compromised first) with a &quot;PDF&quot;, ofc its an .exe but with file extensions being hidden.
 - Inexperienced user had launched it just an hour before the first odd logins.
 - Running it (on an empty user, offline) does open a PDF in the default browser (firefox) but the location is /appdata/roaming/winupdate_2025/out.pdf which is neither the location or name of the original file.
 Curious about how it got access to logins / passwords at this point but exhausted my very shallow knowledge. Any tips for how to dig a little deeper on this?

 It got me thinking...does the nature of the job give us ADHD like tendencies or are there a lot of us that have been running blind forever and this line of work just clicks for us?
 My background is not just in sysadmin. I&#x27;m a DBA, Salesforce Admin, ERP admin so I wear a lot of hats in a small company where I take care of a lot.
 It feels like my brain is the result of my environment instead of the other way around.

 I have no problem doing so as we already use per user mfa across the board, but I have a legacy app that needs to sign into mailboxes using imap to crawl and ingest their content.
 The vendor tells me OAuth will still work with Security Defaults enabled, however everything on Microsoft website says IMAP and POP are disabled when Security defaults is enabled.
 Can anybody confirm this one way or the other, I’m going to raise with MS as well but sometimes that’s not helpful…

                              <span>So basically our company has contracted another company to provide data collection on our machines and robots (similar to production manager and mattec). (was done without my consultation but thats another story). 
 Anyways, for the data collection to work, said company has been having their clients use a small home nat router at the machines/robots to give the robots a private IP and keep them off the network. 
 I said this is dumb to put a million little points of failure at every machine/robot we own. I asked if they&#x27;re is any other way to do this. They said, all the other companies they&#x27;ve done it to have gone this way. (apparently they&#x27;re all smaller places, we are decently sized and have more than one plant so ig we are the Guinea pigs?)
 My proposition is I just get a high end CISCO 9300 and just give the ports private NAT, would that be the best way to go about this? I&#x27;ve asked vendors if this would work and they are clueless, and my peers are just as clueless about it.

                              <span>I deployed my Windows 11 Image via MDT. Customised it, installed all the updates, then sysprepped/generalized and set it to boot to Out of Box Experience. I then created the sysprep &amp; capture task sequence via MDT. When i boot to that task sequence though I get errors that when googling seem to point to the fact that I have sysprepped too early.
 Can anyone confirm this before I start the process from the beginning without actually knowing if its going to work? Or let me know what I&#x27;m doing wrong because this process definitely should be easier than I&#x27;m making it out to be.

                              <span>As part of an overall strategy I am being asked to set up a custom email domain for a business. They intend to sell accounts for various domains. 
 Example: &gt;&gt;
 User then pays some amount a year or whatever to be [person@&gt;&gt;.com](mailto:person@customdomain.com) that&#x27;s just a forwarder. (or I suppose you could pay more for an actual mailbox). 
 Not sure if this is the place to ask but am hoping to get some ideas from this group. 
 Apologies if this isn&#x27;t appropriate for the sub.

                              <span>Hey there! I&#x27;m pretty new to redhat. I just started in a work-project and have the (questionable) honor to get a transaction monitor (openUTM) running. 
 That transaction monitor needs semaphore(s). And for the life of mine, I can&#x27;t seem to get it. I already found out, that &quot;ipcs&quot; shows me semaphores that are already there. But there are none. I think &quot;ftok&quot; should show me a number I can use to add a semaphore - but it won&#x27;t work, ftok always gets a syntax error. 
 I&#x27;m completely new to this, &quot;usually&quot; I&#x27;m just a dev for legacy-software. Any help would be wildly appreciated!

                              <span>A user comes to me today complaining of a issue with there computer, what they described to me was essentially fixed by explaining how sharepoint caching works.
 They also described a mouse issue but it didn&#x27;t happen throughout the day. (not to mention I was 2 desk away and heard them having a complain about this issue. If I hadn&#x27;t have gone and asked the I guarantee I wouldn&#x27;t have heard about it)
 They have had this laptop for 2 months and said it&#x27;s been happening since they got it. 
 If you were in my shoes on the reply would you add a line to the effect of: In the future please be sure to let me know when issues start occurring, so that I can fix them before they intterupt you doing urgent work. 
 Or would you just let it sit? 
 And before you ask: Yes I&#x27;m responding to emails/tickets after hours, no they&#x27;ve never logged a ticket before, yes they know how to log tickets. 
 My question is more do I call them out on it or not?

 One of our factories work with acidic baths. Since this is quite a corrosive environment we are looking in to a protective covers for these AP&#x27;s.
 We have found cover&#x27;s for these AP&#x27;s from Aruba itself, but we don&#x27;t think that these offer the protection necessary.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi all. After a bit of help. Working on a SR650 with Dual CPU and 14x 16GB of memory.
 Sales have sold an extra 4x 32GB to add to the system. I can&#x27;t get this working without it erroring.
 I think the issue is the location of the 32Gb dimms and the matching channels.
 I have the sr650 memory table for 18 dimms but this is no help with where to put the 32GB sticks.
 Is there a configuration helper somewhere or can someone advise?
 I&#x27;ve been using this table, at the bottom

                              <span>Out of the blue an employee, new to the business, wants to be able to attach files to PDF&#x27;s. If there&#x27;s a logical reason to do this, and the business is prepared to fund software licensing to support it (if agreed there will be a small group doing this), then I&#x27;m not aware of any reason to not support the request.
 However, is anyone here more knowledgeable on the above and is aware of any problems that may be caused / issues to be aware of? Wikipedia states that the ISO spec / standard for PDF files allows file attachments so in theory as long as any application (Adobe Acrobat, Foxit etc.) adheres to the standard there should be no problems?

                              <span>This seemed to sneak out at the back end of last week without too much fanfare but MS have announced an EOL date for Windows 10 (with the exception of LTSC versions which have extended support), with the final update releasing in October 2025 and 22H2 being the last feature update to be released.
 MS also announced that the first LTSC version of Windows 11 will launch in H2 of 2024.

 I spent the weekend looking at PowerAutomate, I wanted to know what are some good ideas that I could start implementing as beginner flows?
 Maybe connect it to JIRA for our MSP so when a ticket is updated, it adds it to my Microsoft Planner?

                              <span>I have a 2022 Hyper-V host, installed at Xmas time, which has been working well, except this month, when trying to patch it, I have been unable to get CU April installed. 
 I have tried installing from WU, and downloaded the CU manually from MS Catalog and tried to install it. 
 I have two errors. 
 0x800F081F and 0x80248007
 ​
 I tried running the update troubleshooter, no luck. I followed the instructions for resetting WU:
 Open the administrative Command Prompt and type the following commands one by one followed by Enter key.
 ​
 net stop wuauserv
 net stop cryptSvc
 net stop bits
 net stop msiserver
 Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
 Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
 net start wuauserv
 net start cryptSvc
 net start bits
 net start msiserver
 ​
 Also no luck. Not sure what I need to do to get this update installed. 
 Unfortunately due to an oversight (resolved for future), the last CU was December for Windows, though the Feb .net 3.5 CU was installed successfully. 
 ​
 ​
 Any bright ideas?

                              <span>So I just received a report on an external audit that was done by an external audit firm on the active directory policy at our organization. My question is how does some one go about auditing active directory? Does it mean they have access to the AD and check out the policies or they run it against a software to get the audit policies configurations? I am fairly new to this and I am learning a ton as I go along.

I can&#x27;t find it any longer and searching the internet, I only find articles that explain how to buy or configure microsoft 365.
 Fun fact, I tried the new Bing Chat and it sucked.
 Dear hive mind, help me find what I&#x27;m looking for.

                              <span>So apparently a line card broke somewhere in a Spectrum router in Dallas a few weeks ago, and it broke the majority of IPv6 connectivity in the area.
 I&#x27;ve worked with multiple content providers, from Akamai, Cloudflare, Microsoft, and AWS on mailing lists trying to (mostly successfully) route around the problem, but there&#x27;s still plenty of networks still unreachable.
 How do you even deal with an issue like this? This appears to affect hundreds of thousands of people in the DFW area from our tests asking people on the NANOG mailing list (i.e. unable to ping Quad9 IPv6), but Spectrum has been unable to give us a basic ETTR, even with our multiple Enterprise agreements. They&#x27;ve only assured us it falls under our SLA (which I guess is a good thing, at this point we have a lot of free service).
 If you work for Spectrum, please look at INC000026440632 and ECT-82023751, we are suffering.

                              <span>We are looking at potentially revamping our wireless. We currently have Aruba with an on-prem mobility controller. 106 total access points. We have some weak areas. I do know we would need to increase the amount of aps to increase footprint. Also we would need to beef up for 3 auditoriums. All that being said, Aruba has worked well for us and does well except we need more of them (not a fault of aruba).
 Currently have meraki switching. I&#x27;ve used meraki wireless in the past and it works well enough. I just hate the fact of the licensing with meraki. At least with our current aruba we buy license once and there isn&#x27;t an ongoing cost. 
 All that considered, we have a vendor willing to let us demo juniper/mist, meraki, aruba, or really anything we want. This is in a community college environment. 
 Thoughts? Recommendations? Things to look for during demo?

                              <span>EDIT: Thanks for your input everyone, keep it coming. I still think it&#x27;s better to cross the trunk but I&#x27;m soaking up all your comments to make as an informed decision as possible.
 We’re working on a new building and at the stage of terminating fiber trunks on patch panels.
 Everything is home run from each IDF to the MDF, there are no IDFIDF trunks.
 We’re terminating on duplex LC patch panels.
 The tech doing the termination and I are at loggerheads about how they should terminate. He says they always terminate them straight through (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, etc), but this means we will have to either stock different types of patch cables (crossed and straight) or mess around with rebuilding the duplex LC at one end of the patch cable.
 I’m saying they should be terminating with crossed pairs (1-2, 2-1, 3-4, 4-3, etc) which would allow us to use crossed patch cables everywhere, whether we’re connecting switchswitch within the rack or switchpatchpatchswitch.
 Is there a best practice to this?

 I am really hoping for some help and guidance here.. 
 So a little bit of background about my environment. 
 I am currently updating my company&#x27;s switches. I purchased one Cisco 9300 to use as my core switch and then two 48 port Cisco 9200 switches to use as access switches.
 We have about 50 computers and Polycom VV350 IP phones and I have a eSXI host running a domain controller. 
 I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have the new switches and eSXI host running in a “test” environment so I can get this figured out before implementing my entire infrustructure, but everything is currently working in our production network. Ive been doing a lot of trial and error, but mostly errors.... 
 I don’t have a CCNA and Im not very fluent with Cisco, so Im wondering if there is a way to set this up from …</span>

 I entered a password including a quotation mark and a percentage symbol („ and %).
 The password doesn’t work when logging in.
 I know how to reset the switch to factory defaults. But a) I would like to not have to configure all the VLANs again and b) over the past decades I have encountered such problems with old networking equipment. A few times there were alternative ways of getting back in when „bad“ special characters where used. Once replacing it with an ASCII code worked and once I could truncate the password up until the bad special character.
 Anybody know a way or know any restrictions?
 Thanks for deleting my last post by the way. Top way of moderating.

                              <span>We&#x27;re a relatively small enterprise with two data rooms in the US and EU, and about 15 small branch offices around the globe. I&#x27;ve just taken over operations here, and everything is pretty much end of sale and end of support. We need to expand the network, and I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a good time to maybe revisit what vendors and hardware we should use going forward.
 We have just refreshed the Palo Alto firewalls, and gone SASE with Prisma Access. Each branch office has a routed ipsec tunnel to both data centers. These offices have cisco 2960, aerohive APs and clustered Palo Alto 220/440 series firewalls.
 In each datacenter we have about 6 nexus core switches in VPC, and two ASR1001 as edge routers. Each data center has two ISP’s. Finally each data center has a F5-cluster and a Palo Alto cluste…</span>

Most offices have have multiple 1Gb lines, but it seems as if that will no longer cut it. Higher speed with Wi-Fi 6e and everyone zooming what would you say office speeds should be 10Gb? 100Gb? Are you all experiencing the same issues? What are you doing to resolve this?

                              <span>Recently, we have received complaints from customers regarding slow wifi in a specific section of the floor. Upon checking in Cisco DNAC, I found that the wireless access point (WAP) the client is connected to is showing high noise on the 5GHz spectrum. I changed the nearby WAP into sniffer mode to capture the traffic on the same channel as the WAP with high noise. I now have the packet capture in Wireshark, but I&#x27;m unsure of how to diagnose the problem. I tried searching for a solution to this problem on Google but didn&#x27;t find anything useful. Can you please guide me in the right direction? 
 I have temporarily placed the problem wap in down state

 What are some of the best industries to be a sysadmin? Users are smart, budget is thick, projects are your own. I’m in healthcare consulting at the moment which is pretty smooth.

 Last week, I had two interviews with a small (less than 30 employees) MSP and I thought it went great, both interviewers seemed like good guys and the job would be challenging but I would learn a ton so I was very interested. After the final interview on Thursday, I was told to &quot;probably expect us to reach out soon&quot;.
 Lo and behold, I missed a call from them the next day at 7:30pm, followed by a text from them asking me to call them back when I was available. I text them back about 15 minutes later (when I see the missed call and text), letting them know that I&#x27;m currently out with friends and will call them back on Monda…</span>

                              <span>Hi!
 I want to force 2FA for all users and are searching for a nice USB desk stand.
 The goal would be a very heavy desk usb hub or usb extender or a keyboard with well accessible usb extender.
 How do you solve this? There are lots of small desk stands, but I could not find any really heavy ones (especially in europe).
 Thank you for your thoughts ITStril

                              <span>I’ve been working in IT for nearly 8 years now. I’ve gone from working in a hospital, to a MSP to now fruit production. Before I left the MSP I thought I’d hit my limit with IT. I just feel so incredibly burned out, the job just makes me so anxious all the time because if I can’t fix an issue I beat myself up over it, I always feel like I’m not performing well. I started this new job at the beginning of the year and it gave me a bit of a boost. The last couple of weeks I’ve started to get that feeling again as if this isn’t what I want to do but at the same time is it. I don’t know if I’m forcing myself to continue working in IT because it’s what I’ve done for most of my career or what. Does anyone else get this feeling because I feel like I’m just at my breaking point, I hate not looking forward to my job in the morning.

                              <span>Morning all, happy Monday! 
 Looking for some advice. We had previously removed the Windows 11 bloatware (Climpchamp, ESPN, Tiktok, Instagram, etc) from our Windows 11 Start menus using the follow group policy settings:
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Do not show Windows tips&quot; (Enabled)
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off cloud optimized content&quot; (Enabled)
 Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off Microsoft consumer experiences&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Do not suggest third-party content in Windows spotlight&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off all Windows spotlight features&quot; (Enabled)
 User Configuration -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Cloud Content -&gt; &quot;Turn off the Windows Welcome Experience&quot; (Enabled) 
 This was tested and worked fine, implemented last month and worked fine. Now this morning I am seeing all the bloatware is back, even though my policies are in place. 
 Am I missing a setting, or is this crap finally unremovable? 
  
Edit: Found it, fixed it. Now to test and implement. Check the comments below. Thanks all for contributing!

But now I need to connect from Netsuite using RSA key but Netsuite doesn&#x27;t accept keys without a passphrase. I tried all possible ways even ChatGPT but all failed.

                              <span>Fairly new to an organization and just learned that on-prem AD and O365 do not sync. We have about 400 O365 users, of which 150 of those operate in one of our offices and are built in AD. This means that those 150 users technically have two different set of creds, even though they are likely the same. Apparently, it&#x27;s been like this for years and no one really knows why. Is there any reason you would not want it to sync? What are the potential downsides or gotchas if we were to sync? 
 It seems like syncing would allow for better password management, one place to manage at least some of the users (150 on-prem), better integration with Windows and syncing onedrive, etc. Anything else big to use as a benefit?

 At my previous company I have successfully manually remediated the &quot;Windows Security Feature Bypass in Secure Boot (BootHole)&quot; vulnerability on many Windows servers, however, I am tasked to do it for a few servers at my current company and for the life of me I cannot get it to work.

                              <span>Good Morning,
 This past week I started to see an issue where some client machines on our LAN will acquire a link on a switch but its MAC address is not put into the MAC address table. This causes the machine to appear online to the user but it actually isn&#x27;t. Intranet and Internet are inaccessible. The only way to fix it is to reboot the machine. Disabling and re-enabling the NIC doesn&#x27;t appear to work.
 We have some older switches admittedly... Cisco SG500X-48p running latest firmware, set up in stacks with 4 member switches for each stack. I&#x27;m receiving complaints from users in two different stacks about this issue so I&#x27;m not sure if its happening to others at the moment.
 When a client machine can&#x27;t connect, I log into the switch they&#x27;re connected to and search for the client&#x27;s MAC add…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 For those of you that have taken out cyber liability insurance policy, aside from this being a checkbox that corporate is looking for, from a technical perspective what sort of (if any) engagement do you have with the insurance provider?
 Has there been any sorts of onboarding calls with the provider to go over the claims process in the event of a cyber breach? Things like what we need to be prepared with before making a claim, etc.

                              <span>We are trying to connect our domain joined computers with Beyond Identity and we want to leverage the fingerprint sensor on our laptops.
 We have been able to do this Beyond Identity setup on Android, Mac OS, and iPad with no issues however, when we try to enable biometrics on Windows PCs that are domain joined it wants us to set up a pin and use the Microsoft authenticator app or go through our two-factor authentication provider. 
 Does anyone know of a way to just enable biometrics locally so we can integrate it with Beyond Identity without going through the entire integration process with the cloud etc?

 anyone have recommendations for a white/silver sharpy (some cables will be black)? I see oil based sharpy, something tells me that might not dry.

 I have a small company I am supporting in IT related topics. One of the users has a lot of spam mails incoming. Do you know any client solution that doesn’t necessarily need an email gateway installed? It could cost a few euros, that’s not a problem.
 Thanks in advance

 I wasn&#x27;t sure where put this post , at r/sysadmin or r/programming, so i decided write here.
 I am 18 yo and I&#x27;m in an IT technical school so just starting my way in IT.
 I have a dilemma because I don&#x27;t know what path to take. I&#x27;m very interested in systems administration,networks ( I passed CCNA) etc, but I also really like web programming (js and python html,css, etc). I&#x27;m graduating from technical school in a year, and I don&#x27;t plan to go to college just study in my own. I would like to ask you guys for some advice, because I totally don&#x27;t know what to choose and focus on something. I don&#x27;t want to do and learn several things at once, because it doesn&#x27;t benefit me much.

                              <span>So this happened. A long lost laptop was found in the company that was thought to be part of a rather large security incident we had 2 yrs ago. We really like to access the laptop.
 This is the case:
 - Boots successfully to the windows 10 login screen
 - Computer has bitlocked enabled, Bitlocker key itself is unknown however.
 - Computeraccount was removed from the domain and can not be restored anymore.
 - Because of this, no domain admin or other domain account works.
 - Previous user shown on login screen has unknown password, no other cached domain accounts.
 - Local admin account on the laptop is likely disabled and has an unknown password
 - BIOS is accessible
 We are most interested in a login to get the bitlocker key to enable decrypting the forensic backup.
 I&#x27;m really stuck here. Any thoughts?

 ​
 Recently i&#x27;ve set-up Passwordless Sign-In using Microsoft Authenticator for my organization. This works perfectly for all services connected to the users Microsoft Account. 
 I&#x27;ve tried looking into a way to use the MS Authenticator app as a Sign-In method for InTune enrolled devices (Windows 10/11). Does anybody know if this is available with the current MS Authenticator app?
 Thank you very much for any replies!

                              <span>Hi
 I have a question about a scheduled task
 If you have a scheduled task to run on a timer and the timer is one hour from the time the scheduled task is created. What happens if the user shuts down their machine before the hour ?
 Does the scheduled task never get to run? Does it run on next log on or next time the machine is turned on?
 The trigger is :
 Run powershell script after 60mins 
 Not after workarounds yet or different ideas. Just troubleshooting some that dont run and I want to know why first
 Thank you !

                              <span>I have inherited a Unifi Wifi network which uses RADIUS to authenticate computers onto an Active Directory domain. 
 Problem is, nearly every single laptop does NOT connect to wifi (v6) until the domain (or local) user logs in, and this is killing some, not all, of my GPO. 
 As an example, I set a GPO to add a local admin on laptops. That works. But if I try to deploy an .msi it fails miserably, with error logs telling me the network wasn&#x27;t available. If I run GUPDATE, it fails with the couldn&#x27;t complete message, in that it knows there is an .msi in waiting type of thing. 
 GP Result shows the policies are being applied to the local endpoint.
 I can give more detail when I am back in the office on specifics. 
 If I plug the laptop into the network (physical cable) the .msi deploys without issue, so i am relatively happy that I set the GPO up correctly. 
 I am not entirely sure RADIUS authentication is set up correctly on the DC, but if I am honest, I am a bit stuck where to look, or more importantly, how to check. 
 I have set the network to wait, and the laptops now take 60secs to boot to a Windows log in screen, but the wifi is disconnected, so it&#x27;s pretty pointless having wait for network in place! 
 As mentioned at the beginning, I have inherited this, and there has been an absolute ton of work required to roll out an RMM to approx 150 laptops, much of which I&#x27;ve had to do via Powershell due to the .msi failing, plus other work to get the estate where it needs to be. This GPO thing has taken a back seat, but it is nagging at me to get it fixed. 
 I could leave it now i have an RMM in place, but I would prefer to fix it and have it working as it should so it doesn&#x27;t bite me in the future. 
 I&#x27;m posting this from home on a public holiday, so don&#x27;t have specific information to hand, but will gladly respond with any info when I am back in the office. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>A candidate who is going to have a software development interview with my organization private messaged me on LinkedIn requesting to ask some few questions from me -i assume its to do with the interview, what to expect, technical environment, tips etc
 I have not responded to him, but I feel this is not right.
 I&#x27;m not part of the interviewing or decision-making panel, and i didn&#x27;t even know about this upcoming interview -but i usually prepare the test computer which will have the practical tests or activities when im told to do so i.e just installing programs, dev environments, user profiles etc
 Should I alert my boss(who is part of the interview), ignore her, or hear what she has to ask
 On the other hand i just wouldn&#x27;t want someone to lose an interview opportunity that could transform their life and that of their loved ones over something like this, i.e. if the candidate gets disqualified before the interview (it&#x27;s just my little caring heart).. Maybe they mean well, or maybe they want to gain an unfair advantage by seeking insider information

                              <span>Been doing IT and Web Dev and web server type stuff for many a year and after a 5 year stint doing web dev and management, I&#x27;m back among the IT/Sysadmin crowd. I&#x27;ll be doing Office support and managing some infrastructure for production. I&#x27;ll be part of a really small team, some of whome I&#x27;ve worked with before. I&#x27;m excited to be back in IT as it looks more and more like AI is going to even further commoditize web design and development.

                              <span>Just wondering, how many people are constantly dealing with Microsoft Geolocation ipv4 situation at the moment, I’m having Hobbes if services and users log tickets that they can’t log in, and we have to add them to the exclusion group.
 I’m having Sip phones authenticate from the Netherlands, even though I’m in Australia.
 Lots of my users are apparently logging in from the US from their home network, also had a few from khazakstan…
 Any fixes apart from exclusion groups on CA?

                              <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m a tier 3 Sysadmin who has been supporting Windows for 6 years and more recently, Solaris for the last two as my primary OS. I&#x27;m looking at a job right now where I would need to swap from Solaris to Linux as my primary OS as I escape legacy software hell, and I just wanted to ask; has anyone made this swap before that can give me advice?
 I&#x27;m pretty confident with Solaris and do a good amount of bash scripting. What&#x27;s going to be similar between Solaris and Linux? What&#x27;s going to be different? Are there any pitfalls I should look out for or handy courses I should take?
 Thanks in advance!

In the past I would just supply old iPhones and loaner laptops that would be wiped upon return. Wondering if there’s a better way to secure these users while keeping them somewhat productive.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve completed the shift to be 100% cloud and have no need for on-prem AD anymore. We&#x27;ve disabled AD Connect via the Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false command and uninstalled the agent. We also ran Okta sync and uninstalled that agent as well. 
 We have Okta upstream as our profile source and users are federated with that. Everything appears to be operating nominally but AAD still has some remnants of on-prem AD. It shows Password hash sync, Seamless single sign on and pass-through authentication as enabled (this is after 72 hours of running the command). Running a Get-msolcompanyinformation shows the DirSyncService account name and PasswordSynchronizationEnabled as true but DirectorySynchronizationEnabled is set to false.
 Will that change/disappear over time or are there other things that need to be done to remove them?
 Also, does anything officially need to be done with on-prem AD? We are moving offices and have no need for the current network either so things like DNS and networking aren&#x27;t a concern. I think it&#x27;s as simple as shutting down the servers and scrubbing the hard drives but am wondering if there&#x27;s a step or two that&#x27;s missing.

 I&#x27;ve been a long time Zabbix user for monitoring. Though I recently discovered an issue with my Zabbix that basically means I need to re-install the whole thing. And that amount of work has made me question if I I should go a paid solution.
 What are people using to monitor servers and networking. And what do you manage.
 I am testing PRTG, and when I did a scan of a VM I started wondering, what do I actually need to check on a VM, is just space of drive and some services enough?
 Cheers.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nagging me, nagging me for years that my local ISP central office could have some random employee who likes to parouse through people&#x27;s activities and happened to pick me. ISPs can store logs forever unless I&#x27;m mistaken.
 Maybe even someone there that knows you, or knows someone you know, and presumably has the ability to locate a person&#x27;s activities. See that they visit certain favorites or habits or wherever.
 Is this realistic in any sense, like for someone who lives in a smaller town? Is anything stopping some random ISP employee from seeing what you do online if they choose? Is it de-aggregated in any way? Or is a VPN truly necessary for all activities, not just special ones...
 I worry that VPNs aren&#x27;t truly secure. You&#x27;re passing the puck to the VPN server host, and even then how do you know your VPN isn&#x27;t leaking or dropping out for a split second? I have never been able to trust in VPNs.

                              <span>I need assistance configuring an Enterprise Wi-Fi setup for a client of mine. This is a scenario I’ve done a few years ago in the past, though it seems newer security settings on Windows don’t make the exact method I used possible, and I’m not even sure if the configuration I’m attempting is possible in a secure manner anymore.
 I have access to 
 NPS on Windows Server
 Unfi Access Points
 Active Directory
 ADCS is set up, computers &amp; users are set to auto enroll certificates. User certificates should be unique and are stored in AD so they will roam from computer to computer.
 Is there a way to have enterprise Wi-Fi set up so that when a domain joined computer boots, it authenticates to the Wi-Fi networking using the machine account (via certificates or any other manner), then when the user logs in, the Wi-Fi then authenticates as the user.
 I’ve been able to get one or the other working, but not both – client needs both because there are computers that do not have a ethernet connection that need to be managed even when users aren’t sitting at them. Ideally this will all be transparent to the user and use their credentials/certificates in the background.
 This needs to work for a user that has never signed on to the machine as well – and ideally I’ll be able to filter the users that are able to access the network (eg WORKSTATION1 always on at the logon screen – Bob can log in to WiFi, but Alex cannot as part of their AD Group Membership)

                              <span>Company decided that 20 people in India are better than 5 people in the US and cut the entire US IT team.
 They gave us a couple months notice to train our Indian replacements which sucks but it is what it is.
 I really like my job, but I’m starting to realize I’ve hit a ceiling and if I want to go beyond basic help desk and basic sysadmin stuff I need to learn more.
 Right now I essentially am a T2 help desk guy, I do manage some more advanced systems but it’s basically the annoying stuff that nobody wants to do (cert renewal and management is the big one).
 If I want to move into a 100% sysadmin role what should I be learning while I have the resources at the last three months on the Job? 
 Any help would be appreciated

                              <span>After months of working as a freelancer, I was able to land a remote Sysadmin job at a reputable (or so I thought 😡) company. 
 One month ends and I am sent a layoff mail and also being told I will compensated 3 months severance pay if I sign a Mutual Separation Agreement which I did. 
 I was actively applying for jobs then I get a call from my former manager one saying that there was a change of mind and my role will be reinstated if I choose to go back to work and also there’s been a reshuffle of the entire IT department and my redundant role will now be under infosec team. 
 I am confused on whether I should get back or just continue looking for a job at a different company? The pay there isn’t bad $65,000/yr.

 Windows Offline files has existed for some time now, but it seems like the feature hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed much of the years and there are of course numerous instances of people commenting on how janky it can be or that recommend to avoid it completely.
 Additionally, documentation on the feature outside of the quintessential use case of employees accessing their files remotely is somewhat sparse, and I&#x27;m somewhat confused if I&#x27;m able to configure it in certain ways as some options seem to rely on AD or the files being hosted on a machine running Windows Server. There&#x27;s also some things I&#x27;ve heard, like the feature struggling with l…</span>

                              <span>Hello Sys Admins,
 I&#x27;m a run-of-the-mill shared hosting customer looking for advice: 
 For years, I had Barracuda&#x27;s email gateway security product, sold through my hosting company, and I was always happy with it. Covered all email addresses on all domains, and I could still manage email accounts/forwarders from cPanel with the gateway kind of invisibly in the middle. 
 During the last year, Barracuda bowed out of the small-fry market and my ISP directed me to &quot;professional email services&quot; from titan.email which has not been great at all, and in some respects is absolutely awful (for reasons I&#x27;d be happy to share if anyone cares).
 Anyhoo, are any of you aware of a relatively affordable email gateway security service for someone like me? Between titan and spam assassin, I don&#x27;t seem to have really good choices.
 Thanks in advance...

                              <span>My last few companies have been using google workspace and ive always found it so much easier to manage vs Microsoft 365.
 We use Google Sheets/Docs/Google Meet a lot for our collab and video conferencing but lately we’ve been having a vendor convincing my director to migrate to M365 / One Drive / Teams. 
 I find M365 to be extremely clunky and diffficult to manage. Is it just me or ya’ll feel the same?

 I been transferring client&#x27;s domain from BT to GoDaddy. As a company we have our own WildWest portal with GoDaddy where we usually transfer our other client&#x27;s domains to.
 So it seems that the issue has happened when we gave BT a wrong IPS Tag (to a newly created GoDaddy account rtaher than to our WildWest portal.
 Now it has been almost 60 days and the transfer still has been stuck &quot;in progress&quot;
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Over the last few years I feel like I&#x27;m in a constant battle of having to justify:
 •Why I need to make changes out of hours in a Production environment.
 •Why I can&#x27;t walk out during an Incident to do chores.
 •Why I can&#x27;t give an answer on how long something will take.
 This has only become worse since switching from a hybrid to WFH role, I try explaining it to my family but they have little understanding and the cycle repeats itself.
 Does anyone else find themselves in a similar situation and how do you handle it?

                              <span>I am currently living in Sydney and working as a EUC engineer (level 3 support). I do hold a Hong Kong permanent resident card and have full working rights in HK, In Australia I have a full working rights visa for 5 years during which I will get the permanent residency. I want to build career in IT and maybe start my own business after like 5-7 years of experience. I came to Sydney as a student in 2017 and did my bachelor of Network security. started working as service desk in 2020 and went back to HK the same year and worked as IT consultant, learned SCCM, PowerShell and a bit of Azure on that role, came back to Sydney a year ago and started working on level 3 support.
 I need advice on if I should continue my career in Australia or should i move back to HK. The tax is really high In Australia compared to HK.

                              <span>Traditionally, computing has been deterministic, which refers to the inherent consistency, repeatability, and provability of outcomes in data processing. This is because the output strictly adheres to the programming logic (code written by software developers).
 #LLMs leverage similarity search to process information. During the training phase, LLMs identify similarities among text tokens and create an extensive neural network to capture these patterns. These patterns are then represented in a high-dimensional vector space, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of textual data.
 When processing user input, input sentence is converted into a vector. The OpenAI model then searches for the nearest tokens in the multi-dimensional space, using the shortest distance as a measure of similarity. There is no developers doing the coding to write different logic. Each sentence is following same vector search process.
 Below I show how a sentence is transform into a vector. The model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) in this example is using 768 dimensions. OpenAI has its own API endpoint that do similar processing (text-embedding-ada-002) with 1536 dimensions.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 some info about the systems : its HP,RICOH,Konika Minolta,Lexmark Printers, all of them sitting on the same VLAN dedicated to printers and have static IP address. We use 2016 print server.
 The issue, Printers keep going offline randomly and the only solution to wake them up is to disconnect the network cable and connect it back.
 Lets say out of 12 printers it keeps happening to the same 5-6 printers.
 Now I have disabled SNMP in all of the printers but seems it didn&#x60;t help, they use RAW and port 9100.
 I have checked sleep settings in all of them but you cannot disable it completely.
 We have ALCATEL switches and everything is managed by other company.
 My question is anyone had any experience with this kind of problem?
 maybe the issue is with the configuration on the switch ports since other printers don&#x60;t have those problems?

 I was given about 50 IPs, most are Windows servers and some other devices, and need to quickly identify information about those devices, such as what services they are running, who the owner is, etc. Basically do a bit of detective work on them 🙂. Is there a quick way of automating it? I have the AD domain administrator account. I put together a quick powershell script, but I am new to PowerShell and it doesn&#x27;t work as it should. Basically, it should go through the list of IPs, connect and login to each server and export to csv services that are running along with hostname. Can someone recommend either an already made tool for that, or a better script/solution? In case someone asks to check against inventory, or monitoring system, I don’t have access to those (not sure if inven…</span>

                              <span>I used to frequent this reddit pretty often, but it&#x27;s been quite a while since I&#x27;ve stopped in (related to both personal and professional reasons).
 Last time I was here, there was a lot of talk about the death of the &quot;traditional sys admin&quot; and how everything could be infrastructure as code soon.
 It also seemed that many were predicting the death of the data center and &quot;everything&quot; would be SaaS and/or AWS based soon.
 So I am curious:
 1) Is the traditional sys admin role dead?
 2) Is the physical data center dead?
 3) Did the infrastructure as code revolution actually happen?

                              <span>So like most people my age I have never really done pots...... But I guess it&#x27;s basically just Ethernet with 4 wires.
 But long story short I traced the ports and wires to the location on the com closet and all of the wires are aggregated to a punch down block? Then they go to some grey wire that looks one of those old db25 cables 
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out what this cable is for.

                              <span>i am looking for 10g cisco switch 16-24 ports for enterprise use, i was advised to go for CBS350 but they are for small businesses, i dont have any previous experience or how reliable they are or their lifespan. cisco website suggests enterprise datacenter grade switch but they are expensive ?
 also what happend if i went for something currently not supported like SG550x??

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m recently started learning about datagrams and IP header and I&#x27;m confused for now. To be specific, If we&#x27;re sending datagram without fragmentation, I wanted to ask in which fields router is going to change their contents?
 I know that (I would post a picture of ip header but I can&#x27;t) IP header constists vers, hlen, type of service, total length, ident, flags, fragment offset, ttl, type, header checksum, source IP address, destination IP address, IP options, padding and beginning of payload (data). So again, speaking of regular datagram sending without fragmentation, in which fields the content will be changed?
 ​
 Also, what is the difference if we would do that with fragmentation?

                              <span>So I got this small bit of &quot;what&#x27;s best way to implement this&quot; for a small business.
 There&#x27;s 3 WAN uplinks, from different providers - main one&#x27;s fiber, second&#x27;s through a point to point wifi high speed link and 3rd one is a last resort SIM modem with static IPv4.
 There&#x27;s no ISP support to run a dynamic protocol on either of the 3.
 R1 must dial a PPPoE connection with auth, then receive static IPv4 on pppoe1 interface. Same for R2. Both can also get a /48 IPv6, but that&#x27;s for another time. R3 has a static IPv4.
 Magic question here being: what dynamic protocol could be used between each of the 3 &quot;R&quot; edge routers and FW1 so that:- 0.0.0.0/0 is redistributed, but removed from advertisements should the PPPoE link fail- order priority remains the same (traffic flows through R1, should that fail, through R2 or - finally - through R3 as last resort)
 Initially thinking running IBGP between FW1 and each R router, but with a default originate, the session will always put 0.0.0.0/0 in the session no matter if the link is up or down, or with a &quot;redistribute connected route-map X&quot;, with route-map X permitting just interface pppoe1, but I&#x27;m pretty sure such advertisement won&#x27;t include the 0.0.0.0/0 in it.
 Any other alternatives/protocols just for the default route ?
 From a vendor perspective, all items involved - R1,R2,R3,FW1 - are Linux machines (VMs with NICs in passthrough mode), so any dynamic protocol supported by FRRouting is a go.

                              <span>We currently use a mix of Catalyst switches, most 3850s (and some 9300s and some older switches).
 We have about 200 access switches in total in the environment. We are looking at replacing about 150 of them in the next 2 years.
 One of my team members wants to go full Meraki. We already use their APs and their MX firewalls. 
 I and others on the team are resultant as we sometimes have needed more advanced policy-based routing and such on the Catalysts. On the other hand, we have a mish-mash of versions, routes, etc across the environment. 
 Would a full investment in Meraki make sense, or are we tying our own hands?

                              <span>Greetings:
 My company previously rented a Meraki from an MSP that managed our switches. When we went with a new MSP, they advised we purchase a Fortigate 80E. However, in so doing, we lost the ability to manage our switches without factory restoring them (the first MSP took their secrets with them). The next MSP that sold us the Fortigate always said they would get around to restoring our Cisco switches but ... well, they are out ex-MSPs for a reason.
 So, our company decides to move everything internal. Updating the network is my job. Our physical footprint is shrinking so we have some extra switches. I restore a Cisco SG300 to factory, patch/upgrade it move it into production as a replacement for an in-production, unpatched Cisco SG300 (like-for-like). 
 The Fortigate was config&#x27;d to do all the heavy lifting. It does all the routing, hands out IP leases, etc. 
 So here is the problem. The updated/patched Cisco is installed and up and running. Switching like a champ except it is not appearing at all in the Fortigate ARP table. Further still, the Fortigate keeps giving it an IP address that has already been assigned from the DHCP pool. When I attempt to take DHCP out the equation and assign the Cisco a static IP by MAC address it does not work because the Fortigate never gives an indication it sees the switch (no entry in the DHCP table, no entry in the ARP table). 
 I suspect there must be something misconfigured on the Switch but I can&#x27;t access the gui without a reliable IP address. I can access via console but I am not physically there until monday.
 So, in the interim, any ideas? I am sure its something simple I am missing but sometimes the simplest thing is the easiest thing to overlook.
 Thank you!
 EDIT: I’ll add that the web gui on Cisco was verified as working and it received a unique IP when it was not connected directly to the Fortigate.

 This post got away from me so TL;DR version: SysAdmin at new company. Office 2016. Not hybrid as told. MSP in Germany 100% controls and manages on prem AD, print server, network management, security and software/hardware deployment. I don’t even have Read type access to any of that. Expected to nickle &amp; dime my time with manual clock punches. Future M365/Azure AD plans call for migration to NEW MSP to handle all aspects of it. Prev MSP will still do the rest. Told there is no real structured help desk. This isn’t normal right? 
 To start, I can’t 100% put the blame on this company or the people involved in my hiring process. I didn’t ask the right questions and was too nonchalant about the whole thing. I was looking for a change and this was one of those late …</span>

                              <span>Hey gang, I have ended up wearing the IT hat in our small business (10-20 employees) and have a question as we&#x27;ve run into a bit of an expansion/growth problem :)
 We have a program we need to run to manage our projects which runs on windows and only within the LAN. This is great except a large percentage of our staff use Macs and work outside of the office (don&#x27;t ask!). Our current solutions is to have a bunch of desktop PCs running Splashtop (similar to TeamViewer) within the office so people on macs/working remotely can splashtop in and run the application.
 While the Mac users can boot-up a VM and run the tool via VPN we find that process is way too slow compared to just jumping on a Splashtop machine and opening the app (and requires them to be able to set up and manage a VM+VPN).
 This works ok but we&#x27;re finding it&#x27;s clearly not scalable or efficient.
 ​
 Does anyone know if MS/someone else offers a terminal server product that would be able to host multiple remote connections and instances of the same application at once? Alternatively is there a recommended method for having a server run say 6 VMs each with their own Splashtop instance? I imagine this clearly requires a special MS license? Is there a way to do this with Azure so we can scale it up and down?

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;m looking for a little help finding some settings. It looks like our RMM software has locked updates on our servers, which our infra admin found out when he went to patch today. The same settings have been in place on our workstations, and I was able to find the settings enumerated in the updates menu there. I just can&#x27;t find them in local gpo or the registry.
 I&#x27;m not sure I can post the screenshot of the settings, so I&#x27;ll just type them out here:
 Disable automatic updates Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Get updates for other Microsoft products Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable check for updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable Pause updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Set Automatic Update options Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy 
 Everything in local GPO under Templates\Components\Updates is set to not configured. A few articles online advise going through and turning on all the Windows 10 Telemetry settings, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the fix here. Thanks in advance.
 Edit: screenshot in the first comment.

But for crying out loud we have a balcony, hell take the disabled toilets if you really have to but the network cabinet’s ventilation is not as good as most people think it is (lost count how many times I’ve complained to facilities about that). Depending on where you release, the smell can linger and mature. I had to show one of the AT&amp;T engineers to the networking cabinet in Friday and the smell was so bad I had to apologise and keep the door open for a good 10 mins before he was comfortable enough to work. 
 The worst thing is that this is not the first time this has happened, it’s the 3rd!!!!. I swear to God I only have 2 months left in this hell hole but I’m going to make it my life’s mission to find out who the serial cabinet farter is if it’s the last thing I do. Even if I have to suspend everyone’s security badge, I do not get paid enough to write an email to my staff on a Tuesday to reserve farting at a better more considerate place, can’t imagine how that’s going to go down.

I manage everything on the backend (NAS, VOIP, door access, etc), but I don’t have time to keep up with the workstations so it works. The MSP provides a security package for the users, handle printers, updates, and a few other odds and ends. We switched MSPs last year because of some interpersonal conflicts and the new company looked great. They had a nice portfolio, interviewed well, tickled my ears with a solid “we know this is your network we’re here to help”, AND they specialized in our business type. Part of their contract outside of their maintenance agreement was an AP upgrade for the building. They sold us on a UniFi system and we deployed. A few days go by and I start noticing some weird dropouts in a few different places so I put in a ticket for them to check the auto-negotiation of channels and see if the UDM recommended any changes, etc. crickets Two days later I follow up with an email crickets 3 days later I email the account manager and reply was “I don’t see anything on our end, if you have a minute can you log in and see what you see?” I let him know that a login wasn’t created for me yet, but I’d be happy to. I get the invite, accept, and my jaw hits the floor. The manager had given me access to every one of his accounts, with full admin, AND access to their other customer’s financial backups that they vaulted for them. Needless to say that was our last week retaining that company.

                              <span>My company is going to replace a couple dozen laptops and we have a policy to destroy the hard drives because of the potential privacy/security ramifications. I’m wondering if it’s worth donating the machines despite not being in ‘working order’ or if having them recycled would be better. Anyone have experience going down either path? The machines are like 4-5 years old and decent quality for that age of machine so still lots of life left in them.

                              <span>Hey there, former sysadmin turned pentester here. Recently, in almost every environment, I&#x27;ve been able to privesc from a regular user to Domain Admin using AD CS vulnerabilities.
 I definitely recommend running Certipy or Certify (compiled binary) to see if you can identify any vulnerabilities in your environment. As far as I know, this stuff won&#x27;t come up on a Nessus scan. I know when I was a sysadmin I set this up insecurely (has now been fixed). However, AD CS is easy to set up without knowing some of the security implications of the configurations.
 The guys over at Spectorops who came out with their paper on attacking AD CS (Certified pre-owned) also have a good talk on &quot;ReCertifying Active Directory Certificate Services&quot;.
 Edit: I linked both Certify and Certipy earlier. Certify is a windows application. Certipy is based on python. I prefer certipy. If you want to run certipy it’s pretty easy. One way is to setup a Kali VM. Download that here. 
 Then next through the Kali install. If it pulls dns and up from DHCP you should be good to go. After you’re in, open up a command prompt and type 
 pip3 install certipy-ad 
 Then run
 certipy find -vulnerable -stdout -u lowprivuser@domain.local -p password

 For comparison, computer monitors in a work environment get replaced every 3-4 years.
 How long have you had your current computer monitor and have you had any which lasted more than 5 or even 10 years?

I looked in the system event log but no new event is created on monitor wake up.
 Since the computer locks on sleep, my plan B is just to set the monitor and computer sleep timeouts to the same values, but out of curiosity I&#x27;d like to know if this is possible first.

 With all the recent redundancies which have been going on I’m one of those who have been affected. At the risk of disclosing too much I’m in a management position but don’t have much technical skills anymore and was hoping for some general career advice and CV writing tips. Im pretty much getting butchered in a lot of interviews because I’ve “lost touch” with tech in general :(. 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
 Edit:happy to send my CV across via chat, I’m mainly playing this carefully because of my NDA

 I&#x27;m thinking of allowing PIN codes to serve as lock screens as well. 6-digit min.
 Anyone have had issues with the use of Pin codes?

                              <span>Hi, right now I am unable to login (locally) on my Win10 workstation. I see the &quot;spinning circle&quot; but it definitely hanged.
 I have OpenSSH server installed on my workstation, so I&#x27;d like to try solving the problem without rebooting (which will definitely works!)
 I just killed all my Firefox&#x27;s processes with taskkill, shutdown a couple of Virtualbox VM machines (which were running totally fine!).
 I just noticed that tasklist is unable to complete, it stops at
 ​
 System Idle Process System Registry smss.exe csrss.exe 
 Powershell Get-Process is working fine (it shows all processes).
 If it happened to you, how would you approach it?
 Forgot to mention: I am also unable to login through RDP

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I&#x27;ve seen a lot of talk about veeam here and have taken the plunge into testing it out. I&#x27;ve started getting everything set up and will test backups further down the road but thought I&#x27;d ask y&#x27;all first before spending too much time. 
 I&#x27;m looking to backup Azure vms running MSSQL, and those servers have separate managed disks containing the MDF, LDF, and daily backups. Would veeam for azure also backup those managed disks or is it just going to grab the vm and it&#x27;s OS drive?

                              <span>So in the past I&#x27;ve mostly developed custom solutions using SharePoint with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, as well as calling the SharePoint API. 
 I&#x27;m consulting for a company and so far I&#x27;ve talked only to the non-technical guys. The non-technical guys told me that their in house engineering team &#x27;overcomplicated&#x27; the process by adding a lot of if/else conditions, etc. The engineering team hasn&#x27;t written any documentation, so I&#x27;m not inclined to believe that the process that they came up with is the most clear and easy to follow. At the same time, if the process was super simple (setting up a SharePoint form, automating tasks with Power Automate and Power Automate), then the non-technical team could have just used the drag and drop interface and do it themselves. It&#x27;s sort of a typical issue where the non-engineers don&#x27;t understand exactly what needs to be done on the technical side, so they think the issue is way more simple than it actually is. 
 I&#x27;ve been asked to come up with a recommendation for the best path moving forward and I&#x27;m not super sure what to suggest. I&#x27;m leaning towards starting from scratch, writing custom JavaScript when needed, and then of course, writing clear and easy to use documentation. 
 Part of me wonders though if the hardest part of this whole workflow is simply working through all these very domain specific edge cases. I can foresee issues down the line where the people giving the directions / exec team doesn&#x27;t have a good understanding of their current systems, yet they&#x27;ll still want a very specific result. 
 I guess my question is what to &#x27;recommend&#x27; for next best steps that gives the exec team confidence in my recommendations, and also reduces the headache / back and forth nitpicking that I am anticipating with the exec team?

                              <span>Have you noticed recently SaaS providers are pushing extremely hard for additional sales. My company have multi-million dollar contracts with SaaS providers and they all exhibit the following behavior:
  
Enterprise support downgraded to basic support. Start pushing &quot;Enterprise Plus&quot; support plus for advanced support.
 New feature sets that provides marginal improvements to Security, UX, Workflow, etc... Now an Add On, on top of your Enterprise License.
 We let go your dedicated CSM and triple you up with another CSM. This CSM comes in doesn&#x27;t know much, doesn&#x27;t keep promises of the old CSM, and pushes twice as hard for add on services.
 Your assigned enterprise technical architect that provided you recommendations and project work, he/she is too busy right now. Your CSM schedules him/her 2 weeks from now because of increase in workload AND reduce the hours available. (Before it used to be a few days, and as many hours as you reasonably need). THEN THEY TRY TO SELL YOU EXPERT TECHNICAL ARCHITECT SERVICE TO FILL THE GAP.

 Can you suggest some cheap models available in Europe?

                              <span>We have a new building going up (and other building works) at work which means new fibre being installed and existing fibre being cut and spliced.
 Looking at getting some basic fibre fault finding/troubleshooting tools to help with (just had this happen this week) &quot;the fault is with your equipment&quot; after fibre cutting and splicing has been done and said network was working right up until the point of the new joins being terminated into the comms rack.
 Anyway, looking at the Fluke (totally open to other options) FiberLert and VisiFault and if I should get both or just one or even something else totally.
 What I *think* we need is just a basic visual fault finder that shoots a light down a link but would like to hear from others what they recommend that onsite teams have/use for fault finding/troubleshooting before calling in professions.

I&#x27;ve spent a ton of time researching and configuring, but this is far beyond my self-taught knowledge. I&#x27;d appreciate having a more skilled set of eyes look over what I&#x27;ve configured. Priorities are uptime and reliability. There are 10-12 staff on-site at a time and 10-15 patients. The site is about 2000 sqft. The owner isn&#x27;t fond of monthly fees or lengthy contracts, so I have to have reasonable justifications for those, but he is willing to spend on capital purchases. Here is what I&#x27;m currently working towards:

We do not have much on prem hws (40ip would be more than enought) and our contractor said if its separated from everything else it wouldnt be an issue to use it for iscsi and nvme over tcp.
 Whats you opinion on this?

 I have 4 routers in the lab. R1 is Cisco and R2, R3 and R4 are Juniper. The topology is basically 
 R1&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R2&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R3&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;R4
 I have configured VLAN 2 on an SVI on the Juniper and Cisco switches, with trunk links between them. I can ping all the way from R1 to R4 with no problem. 
 Routers 2, 3 and 4 all have adjacencies to each other. R1 only has an adjacency to R2 but &#x60;show isis neighbors&#x27; shows R3 and R4 as being in the INIT stage. I&#x27;ve checked the MTU, even changed it and I&#x27;m getting the same behavior. I&#x27;ve put my configs below, and I&#x27;m hoping the experts here can point me in the right direction, what am I missing here?

                              <span>I’ve been struggling with this all day. I had to fire one of my techs today. I’m 99% sure I did the right thing, but feel awful about it. 
 Here’s the quick version of what went down. He was Help Desk admin, so he had some admin-level credentials and access to a fair few systems with risk and trust involved. One day, last week, he had a user reach out to him after-hours, needing admin credentialed approval for a software update on their laptop. Now, either out of sheer laziness, lapse in all judgment, or a weird crush he had on this user, he decided that rather than remote into the user’s laptop, type his creds in to get the update pushed through, and call it a day… he simply gave the employee his admin-level username and password over a Teams chat message.
 To say this irritated me when I…</span>

 Amazon Bussness has a form where you can provide details of a project and they will give you a custom quote on huge quantity of something.
 I can&#x27;t remember what the minimum is for a large quantity quote but I think it is truly meant for large enterprise rollouts. For example: 10000 Sticks of 16gb ddr4 ram or 10000 iPad cases.
 (Also open to other suggestions of of a good vendor to buy a large quantity of ram from and suggestions on the best brands.)

 While replacing his power strip I see one of the plugs is electrical taped. Yup, someone, maybe him, bought a power adapter from goodwill for $1.99. One side of the electrical cord had broken at the strain relief so the genius had electrical taped it so that it mostly made contact. It was the power cord for the monitor’s power brick, so I can only imagine when it would lift, power would get pulled through the hdmi cable and, zap! He’d get a shock. 
 I don’t know why this monitor has a goodwill power adapter?? People will “solve” their own problems in fantastically stupid ways.

That they &quot;believed&quot; they had a responsibility to ensure user choices were respected? That they &quot;understood it was important&quot; that they lead by example with their own first party Microsoft products?
 Well...
  
Web links [...] in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge. [...] A similar experience will arrive in Teams.
 Links will open in Microsoft Edge even if it is not the system default browser in Windows.
  
Because fuck respecting user choices and leading by example. Gotta continue pushing Edge no matter what.

                              <span>My company purchased a building recently, and inherited a Honeywell access control system. The company we purchased it from had a ProWatch server that is now disconnected. Until we can decide on new floor plans/layouts and then rip and replace the access control system, we&#x27;re currently stuck with the badges that we got from the old tenant. 
 We&#x27;re running out of badges at this point, and I was hoping to be able to get connected to these controllers and add/change some badges. It&#x27;s not a pressing matter yet because very few people have moved in, but as we start doing construction and the like it&#x27;s going to get complicated. 
 We&#x27;d really rather not pay Honeywell for their ProWatch software only to replace it 6 months down the line. Anyone have any experience working with these systems outside of the way Honeywell intended? If we&#x27;re stuck then we&#x27;re stuck and we&#x27;ll deal with it. Just looking for options.
 Failing this I may just get a badge cloner and some re-writables.

                              <span>Hello, Our department recently was given a couple free racks. However, we use vertical mount PDUs. This picture here shows how they attach, with the kind of &#x27;hook on PDU slots downward with weight/gravity into hole in rack&#x27; - I don&#x27;t know what this mounting connection is called, if it does have a formal name.
 Unfortunately, the new freebie racks don&#x27;t have this socket-for-a-hook that our existing racks, APC units, have. Instead they have these odd square holes surrounded by small circular holes. Problem: I also don&#x27;t know what this is called so my Google-Fu is lacking.
 I know that attachments like this exist where you consume 1U or 2U to add horizontally-jutting out attachments which adds these sockets, but I&#x27;ve worked with those before and they really take up a lot of space in a rack that I&#x27;d rather be using for network cables (gone are the days of one cable per physical host, hah). Also we put our Cisco switches at the top of our racks, exactly where these horizontal add-ons would go.
 So instead I&#x27;m wondering if any of you know of an item that can attach into those square holes in my picture, to add a round socket so I can hang my vertical PDUs. Or even just the terminology, so I can at least do more effective searches.

                              <span>I manage a service that uses Cloudflare to protect services for about 300 customers. Not a big fish, but big enough to spend a few thousand $ per month and have a dedicated customer success rep. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the new team that was assigned to me, and I wonder if it&#x27;s a widespread issue, or just the luck of the draw.
 Recently, a lot has changed at Cloudflare:
  
They reorganized things to downgrade their baseline enterprise support, and make you pay for the &quot;premium&quot; level that used to be the baseline. That&#x27;s fine- I don&#x27;t need that much support. And I was honestly surprised at how much handholding they gave me before.
 The Customer Success team turned over a few times before I could even meet them. Again, that&#x27;s fine, and understandable if Cloudflare is shaking things up.

                              <span>Wanted to post this as a heads up, in case anyone else stumbles across it.
 The issue is that USB audio devices with microphones attached directly to the laptop will show that no microphone input is available. If you are looking at the old Sound control panel, you will see the microphone entry but no level meter off to the right.
 The fix was to rollback the driver to the previous version, in our case .6815 version.

                              <span>Cyber security is tough. Patching, incidents, email spam among my other sys admin duties. Today i was forwarded an email by account asking if the email was legit. It had made it pas all our safeguards, looked legit but the person in accounting noticed the from email did not match the normal sender. 
 While picking the email apart it was indeed a spoofed email with a .PDF malware attachment. Caught by a keen eye, the security training we&#x27;ve done and the test emails are working! 
 Anyway through my dissection of the email i was able to track it back to the company that owned the domain and found that it was a compromised O365 account. It was a doctors office in NYC about 90 minutes from our location. 
 I thought &quot;Great i got their contact info let me just give them a heads up to have their IT look into the issue.&quot; Let me tell you this did not go at all how i had hopped it would. 
 I called their office and asked to speak with the Doctor running the practice or the office manager. After a moment on hold i got to speak with the office manager. I explained who i was, what company i was with and relayed my contact info should they need to follow up. I then explained that we received an email from their O365 portal and that one of their accounts or possibly their whole O365 account was potentially compromised and they should speak with their IT team to investigate. 
 I don&#x27;t know if i sent this poor persons brain into overload or what but as soon as i finished talking they started to berate me like i was somehow the person that compromised their systems. I didn&#x27;t want any recognition i just wanted to do the right thing and let them know of the possible breach. But instead all i got was about 3 minutes of angry Karren before they simply hung up. 
 Any one else come across something similar? Try to do the right thing by letting someone know only for it to fall on deaf ears or worse?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious as to the community&#x27;s thoughts on this.
 Our helpdesk is regularly inundated with tickets about Excel, usually along the lines of &#x27;Excel is freezing or crashing&#x27;. It&#x27;s almost every case, it can be narrowed down to a few standard culprits:
  
3rd Party Add-in (for us it&#x27;s an add-in that pulls data from our ERP - Dynamics or JDE)
 Spreadsheets linked to 30 other spreadsheets, of which half the links are usually broken
 Macro or VB issues
 Some frankenstein spreadsheet with quarter-end balance info that&#x27;s been in use since 1997.
  
Our finance team gets frustrated because they always come running to IT, but realistically there&#x27;s little we can do, because 95% of the time it&#x27;s not really an actual PC or app problem. We endlessly communicate this, but of course people come to see us regardless.
 We&#x27;re thinking of implementing a policy of not being able to support Excel.
 Curious how you all handle &#x27;those excel issues&#x27;.

                              <span>I remember back in the day it was a big deal to make company wide changes. At what point did Microsoft decide they were in control and know what&#x27;s best for our companies?
 Case in point: They release &quot;Roaming Signatures&quot; and push it out, without asking, and without warning.
 So now I&#x27;m creating a company wide GPO to disable it because its completely borked our signature systems, and in our field our email signatures are extremely important.
 I find myself more and more often having to setup stuff to block things MS has just decided to push out.

                              <span>I have one windows 11 device that will not allow me to connect to it using RDP unless I set the security layer to RDP. 
 The specific error I get when it’s set to negotiate or SSL is “Server message: AADSTS293004: This target-device identifier in the request “name-pc” was not found in the tenant “our tenant ID””
 When looking at the RDP logs I see where TCP read and write fail. And after setting the security layer to RDP, I connect directly to the device but am at the computer login screen VS the window that usually pops up authenticating me to AzureAD before allowing any access to the PC. 
 I’ve wiped the PC to no avail. Any ideas what I can do to further troubleshoot or remediate the problem?

                              <span>Having a debate with coworkers about Specops settings. We can ban dictionary words, but also set a minimum length for a passphrase. My assumption is that when the policy sees &quot;Chocolate14$&quot; it contains a dictionary word, and is not allowed, but if it sees &quot;Ilikechocolatecake365!&quot; then it sees it as a phrase. My coworkers contend that the presence of any dictionary word means the password is non-compliant, so the passphrase setting is conflicting and useless.

 I feel like disclosing my ADHD/ASD is a problem and instead of being asked to give my side of things and the benefit of the doubt, it&#x27;s easier for family, friends and colleagues, etc to make assumptions. 
 I have been told I have behavioural and communication issues and at school I got bullied for being different.
 A usual trend is or was people usually start conversations with &quot;a couple/few people have mentioned/ told/ brought to my attention...&quot;
 When I&#x27;ve tried to explain myself or seek clarity they&#x27;ve assumed I&#x27;m trying stuff on.

                              <span>Hey everyone. There is a Dell Precision tower that has ubuntu loaded on it and is used by our developers. Someone tried updating cuda and it basically caused the SSD to not boot to the OS. A ton of error messages appeared. To make a long story short, I went into recovery mode, removed all NVIDIA drivers, cleaned it and booted to the OS with no problem. Once we rebooted the machine again, it reverted back to the previous state of not booting to the OS and now I&#x27;m not able to get to the recovery mode. I ran a ton of commands and can&#x27;t get to recovery mode or to the login screen. So what I did was imaged another SSD and removed the old one. 
 My question is, is there a way for me to get the data off of the old SSD and load it onto the newer SSD? There are a few very specific files they&#x27;re wanting off of the old SSD, which will save them time in recreating everything from scratch. ORR would it be ok to connect the old SSD as a secondary drive and they get to the files from there while the tower boots to the newer SSD??? I&#x27;m just trying to figure out the best way to go about this and I&#x27;m by far not great with Ubuntu; it&#x27;s too sensitive..lol. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone, you&#x27;re my (pretty much) last resort as I am looking for a solution to this problem for quite some time now.
 Our small non-profit currently does not have dedicated E-Mail adresses, our members use their own (personal) E-Mail adresses (gmail, yahoo, you name it). I&#x27;ve set up some forwarding e-mails, e.g. finances@ourdomain.com to the personal adresses of our members. This is not the best solution since every position is occupied with at least two persons and everyone gets a copy of the E-Mail. In total we are talking about around 10-14 people/users and a total of around 6 shared inboxes.
 The next step was looking for an MS Exchange with shared inboxes and automapping to outlook. We cannot use the official O365 due to GDPR restrictions of our governing body and would have to use an on-premise solution. Microsoft does not allow for shared inboxes on mobile devices under on-premise hosting. All the available workarounds I found online (enabling insecure IMAP connections, enabling the deactivated user in the Exchange panel) are not allowed by either the hosting company or violate Microsoft licensing terms.
 So the next thought was several IMAP accounts. No usually as an admin, I&#x27;d have to give the shared account credentials to everyone involved. I stumbled upon the Nextcloud Mail App which allows for multiple mail accounts, maybe that&#x27;s a solution. I&#x27;ve already posted this idea in the /r/Nextcloud subreddit.
 Do you have an idea concerning this matter? All in all, I want several users to connect to the same mailbox via their personal PCs (they use Outlook there) and their mobile devices (they either use a Mail App of their choice or I could talk them into using a separate app if neccessary).
 I&#x27;m really at loss here, hoping to get some ideas :)

                              <span>Over the past few weeks we have noticed odd behaviour with MS more specifically EXO. Our latest complaint is safe emails are now all of the sudden going into quarantine. We are a mortgage company and our users do business with many 3rd parties. Emails were flowing with out issue up until recently. Communication between our users and external 3parties starts out as it should, then for some reason the detection methods go crazy and quarantines the emails. Its becoming a headache to monitor the quarantine, release and report/submit false positives to MS. In the past 30 days we have submitted over 500 emails as false positives. On the MS doc for Secure by Default, it states that this cannot be turned off by admins. And the percentage rate is low for false positives. I dis believe this as we are seeing a high impact. I have done some tweaking by adding these domains to safe senders list but this has little resolve as some of the messages are marked as High Conf Phish. While reviewing the report in quarantine for these emails nothing is being marked as a threat - attachments, urls or images . All pass. No campaign or other indicators except for &quot;Advanced Filter technology&quot;. I have turned off &quot;mailbox intelligence&quot; in the filters but that has done nothing. I have opened a ticket with MS and its going no where fast. I have even shared the article they have published on Secure by Default and highlighted that part where it states safe emails are being marked as phishing. Anyone else experiencing this headache?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m in charge of my first power down for all our systems today, usually there are a couple of us taking care of these, this is the first time I&#x27;ll need to down the MSAs. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve lost my Googling skills, but I realised I don&#x27;t have any GUI for the MSA, so how do I turn them off?
 I can&#x27;t find an answer anywhere and the manager is unavailable for contact.
 We have x1 2040 and x1 2060.
 The only reference says just hold the power buttons down, but that can&#x27;t be right?

                              <span>Hello,
 We have an AD user that is not a member of Domain Admins group anymore but he is still able to log-in into domain controllers and add other users to the group Domain Admins within a tool &#x27;Active Directory Users and Computers&quot;. User doesn&#x27;t have local admin permission on domain controller.
 We&#x27;ve tested this scenario on brand new user but without successful reproduction.
 Delegate Control is saying that user doesn&#x27;t have permissions &quot;Write members&quot; on Domain Admin Groups.
 Have any of you been struggling with such case? Where we need to start looking?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I live in Iran and there are severe inte4rnet restrictions here so we all need to use VPNs for our daily usage,
 We cannot use TOR or any subscription based VPN that is operating outside of Iran, so we need to setup our own VPNs.
 I Need to buy a VPS and run WireGuard on it so I can create VPN profiles on it and onwards I will distribute these profiles among people.
 I need help choosing a provider that is reliable enough for using them as a VPN, I cannot spend a lot of money on this VPS so please keep the suggestions to the budget category.
 I am sorry if there are any Grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language.
 and I need minor help regarding the specs of the said VPS I haven&#x27;t fully understood how strong of a VPS I would need to purchase.
 Thanks guys

                              <span>For context - I am a Linux guy. However, my brother owns a small manufacturing business that uses Windows tablets on the shop floor. As you can imagine, in that environment, the average lifetime of a tablet is not great. The other gotcha is that I am remote and have been setting these tablets up for him remotely - He connects them to the shop floor wifi, I do the rest.
 So what I&#x27;m looking for is some software (Free, paid, whatever) so that I can create a master image from one of these freshly set up tablets and then either write that to USB or maybe deploy via PXE (Not sure if the tablets can even have their boot order changed, so that may not be possible). If there is some software that can create a &quot;Plug in the usb stick and walk away&quot; image, that would be best as he&#x27;s highly non-technical.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>now i have i pretty laid out gov job where i develope internal tools and manage like 20 pcs. the pay is decent, i have a lot of free time to read books, think about hobbies, browse the internet, get into stuff like indie game dev, and its close to my home. the second job that i get offered pays around 15 to 20 % more but its a lot more work less free time, and pretty much 90% work where the other job is like around 50% so its not that fullfiling (maybe less lol im maxing stuff here). so pls guide me what do you think.
 should i take the switch (and make my life around my career). or should i stay and do something on the side (im thinking about indie game dev) and if u can tell me about anything good to do on the side to get me a hobby that pays that would be great. and thanks.

                              <span>Hello boys and girls,
 I would like to ask for your knowledge and help on finding a software that meets my needs. The case is as follows: in the next week I&#x27;ll acquire some 1500 used laptops. Most of them are in unknown state and I need to perform some diagnostic and reporting on it. I imagine something like setting up some network boot environment as I have enough space for connecting some 20-40 laptops at once and boot them up. After performing the diagnostics I should have a saved report somewhere. Also if there is an option for wiping the laptop would be a big plus. As always, if it&#x27;s open source, it would be better.
 I don&#x27;t seem to be able to find anything useful and I would appreciate your input on this. Thanks!

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t find any better place than this if it&#x27;s ok?
 So i have some drives encrypted with truecrypt. Haven&#x27;t uses the drives for a couple of months, but have the password written down somewhere
 I connected the drives to my windows 10 pc
 Tried login in with password... says it it&#x27;s wrong
 Started to look for some information, some are saying, when this is happening, the partition could be damage
 After a while of thinking, i tried something i did not find, my partitions does not have any letters, but can been seen in any partition program, my solution to get truecrypt accept my password was following
  
Open diskmanagment
 Selectet your hidden drives and add letters to the drives
 Then a pop up windows says the drive needs to be formatting, ignore that, close down pop up window
  Remove the letters you added to your hidden drives
  Now you should be able access your hidden drives through truecrypt
  
At least my drives wasen&#x27;t damaged
 But why did true crypt not find my hidden partitions in the first place? It did months before?

                              <span>So in 25ish years in IT I&#x27;ve always worked places that bought their desktops outright and I&#x27;ve had zero experience with leasing equipment. Yesterday I was chatting with a friend whose company just signed an agreement to lease 300+ desktops for 3 years and he shared that the agreement stipulated they had to return the equipment in the original boxes at the end of the lease. It still blows my mind a little and I&#x27;ve been processing it for almost 24 hours.
 Is this kind of requirement a normal thing in equipment lease agreements? If so, is it something vendors actually enforce? If so, how in the hell do companies store hundreds or thousands of boxes with packing materials for years? It sounds wildly impractical to deal with this.

 ​
 Do you have any tips what to check when one users Mac prints in isolation mode?
 ​
 The setup is that we have a print server setup and printer driver is installed locally there, we add the printer in Mac by adding it as Windows printer via spools. We have added it the same way on other computers and it works fine but for one user it won&#x27;t work.

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been discussing this with Mimecast themselves and they keep redirecting us to the Blocked Sender and DNS Authentication policies.
 What we are trying to determine if possible is, can we configure Mimecast in such a way that it would choose to honour a DMARC policy that has hold or reject configured, but have it ignore any policy with a none option set and then apply our own override?
 I can appreciate the issues this is going to potentially cause with valid business email being blocked as not everyone has DMARC correctly configured (hell, our sister companies don&#x27;t!), but we are looking at this as purely a technical discussion right now. Mimecast&#x27;s solution is to have manual intervention and have us manage the blocked senders list by adding domains in response to events such as a phishing attack. That&#x27;s not a valid solution for us. We are discussing and looking for a purely automated solution here.

                              <span>Hi
 I built DATA CENTER with central DC&#x27;s VM that holds the DNS services and the RDS license services, and under it, I made all the VM&#x27;s with Tree Trusted Domain (with realm Trust Type). Each VM gets its RDS license from the DC directly (through GPO redirect to the RDS license server&#x27;s IP); sometimes, the VM drop from the RDS license server; I should enter the Remote Desktop Licensing Diagnoser, renew the connection to the RDS license server, and resupply the credentials!
 How can I reserve the connection to the RDS server? Is there any other method that can resolve my issue?
 Do I have to add a universal group with RDSadmins that can cross the trusted forest, and which appropriate&#x27;s group should it be in the DC server?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys,
 So we are using Aurora MySQL for our production.
 Once in a while, we need to manually do some data manipulations in the database. In these cases, one of the approved senior engineers who has privilege log in to a production container and run the queries required. Users who log in to the production environment are logged and recorded, however, there is no record of what they did. Maybe they did some data manipulation or maybe not. But there is no way to know it.
 How do you guys record these? Or what is the best practice for cases when manual data manipulation is required?
 Cheers.

                              <span>I’m extremely frustrated , please excuse my rant. I joined IT pretty late in my life, was 29 when I landed my first Helpdesk gig, 1.5 years later got headhunted by Microsoft to join their Helpdesk, made it to manager in 3 years from agent to supervisor then manager and yesterday got served my 3 month notice for redundancy. I’m based in the UK and I’m seriously disappointed. My comanager was barely around (constantly disappearing, never showing up to the office to look after his kids, taking weeks of sick leave) so I had to pick up on his slack and do the work of 2 full time managers. Even though we report to the same manager, I complained about him several times but my manager said there’s nothing she could do thanks to employee rights. Me being me, I constantly worked 10 hours a day as well as evenings, weekends, took my work laptop with me while I was on vacation to Spain and Cyprus. People see my success and obsessive nature but I sacrificed a lot, my girlfriend left me, I’m the fattest I’ve ever been, my cholesterol levels are through the roof and I’ve developed extremely painful haemorrhoids to where I almost passed out from the pain in the office bathroom. I get out of breath when tying my shoe lace! Now on top of everything I’ve been made redundant. 
 I don’t have anything left in the tank to do anything more, I bombed my last interview as a manager for a fintech company and with only 1 years managerial experience it’s doubtful I’ll get another manager gig. So by the end of all this I’ve ended up a sad fat lonely burnt out idiot who sacrificed literally everything to get to absolutely nowhere. Argh!!!!

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all! I started working for a small nonprofit and I&#x27;ve been tasked with improving their network infrastructure. Currently, all their main network is in one main building and it&#x27;s branching out to 2 separate buildings with an outdoor CAT 6 cable that is just hanging through the roof (it goes through trees as well). Of course, the internet in the outbuildings is very poor, barely reaching 50mbps while the main building has speeds of ~500mbps. 
 I&#x27;m proposing using Fibre optic cable underground that goes from the main building to the two outbuildings. My plan is as follows:
  
Dig a trench of about 18-30&quot; deep. 
 Use PVC for conduit and pass armored pre-terminated single mode Fibre optic cable through it. 
 The ends will be connected to media converters to convert the optic signals both ways. 
 The media converters will then be connected to the router with an ethernet cable and from there to the switches. 
  
In yalls opinions, is this a sound plan? Am I missing anything or not taking into consideration something? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We have 2 datacenters, connect by 4 switches and 100Gbit trunks. We found out that the 100Gbit trunk is limiting our network performance. We place 2 servers 1 in each datacenter. Each server has a 100Gbit network card but 40gbit dac cable. We can only reach 30gbit instead of 39/40 bit with iperf. When the servers where directly connected they reached 39/40. Does anybody know what is going wrong ?
 The connection is like this
 Server -&gt; 40gbit -&gt; switch -&gt; 100Gbit &lt;- switch &lt;- 40gbit &lt;- server
 All switches are dell S5232f We ordered 100Gbit dac to check what will happen on that speed.
 Maybe someone has had the same problem before?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Earlier today I found out about this interesting problem i just can&#x27;t wrap my mind about.
 We recently purchased new big ass Palo Alto firewalls for DMZ/Internet Access.
 Declared Threat Prevention throughput is over 120Gbit/s appmix. Our Internet connection is 100G.
 We&#x27;re not done with the migration yet so we&#x27;re pushing through roughly 2Gbit/s atm.
 We&#x27;re doing SSL decryption on all HTTPS traffic over the standard and a few not standard ports.
 I had two incidents open from our colleagues who reported huge performance hit while working on VPN and downloading specific files. Upload was fine.
 Went on to check myself and I was able to reproduce it on quite a few sites that are inspected.
 These guys who reported the issue also captured a speedtest image of a known speedtest site …</span>

 I know VyOS, FRRouting, Mikrotik, Linux...
 I&#x27;m thinking of testing/using SONiC... any other ideas?
 It is a traffic that more or less 10Gbps
 I need IPv6, VXLAN, BGP, OSPF...

                              <span>Was doing some reading on VLAN 0 and how it&#x27;s a tag that gets applied to traffic requiring CoS but is not associated with a VLAN. Then it got me thinking: what traffic aside from switch-generated traffic (ie: STP, CDP, etc.) wouldn&#x27;t actually get tagged across a trunk anyway? According to Cisco:
  
A switch may also have to send untagged traffic across a trunk link. Untagged traffic is generated by a switch and may also come from legacy devices. The 802.1Q trunk port places untagged traffic on the native VLAN. The native VLAN on a Cisco switch is VLAN 1 (i.e., default VLAN).
  
So lets say a legacy device with a NIC driver that doesn&#x27;t support VLAN tags is plugged into an Access Port. It sends traffic. An Access Port in a VLAN environment is always going to associate incoming traffic from an end device with a VLAN. To that point, wouldn&#x27;t the traffic get tagged with that ID as it traverses a trunk port? What is it that&#x27;s telling the switch to not apply a VLAN ID? There must be something, no?

                              <span>I work as the sole sysadmin at an SMB (50-100 employees). We have two physical servers running Windows Server 2016 and 2019, both hosting Hyper-V VMs (&lt;10 combined) in an AD environment. We also have a QNAP NAS for file storage. Given the following constraints, which is the least laughable option for backing up my VMs to the QNAP? (If not obvious from the below list, all are free options for me at the moment)
  
Using QNAP&#x27;s built-in Hyper Data Protector tool
 Running Veeam Community on a separate, older Dell PowerEdge 1850 (would be spinning up as 3rd physical server)
 Running Veeam Community as a VM on one of the two Windows Servers
  
I&#x27;m currently backing them up using QNAP&#x27;s HDP, which has been working fine. I&#x27;m a little nervous about its reliability and potential for vulnerabilities though, given it&#x27;s not QNAP&#x27;s main forte and they&#x27;re not the most responsive to fixing them. I thought about trying out Veeam to see why everyone likes it so much. I know running on old hardware is a little risky, but I fear running it as a VM on the same hardware as the rest is riskier. If there&#x27;s another free option I&#x27;m missing here that you&#x27;d recommend, I&#x27;d love to hear it.

                              <span>A website I&#x27;m hosting got it&#x27;s domain and/or ip listed on a blocklist that Sophos appliances and some AV/Web Filtering clients use. This is to the best of my knowledge a false positive or a human error. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if you guys have any resources to find what major security appliances, EDR, AV, web filter vendors have added us to their list and maybe even get a category / reason for that block. 
 I&#x27;m basing my assumption on the fact that some vendors like fortigate have a publicly available filter search with the possibility to ask for a review of a specific ip or url like here:

                              <span>Was interviewed for a security analyst job for the second time, I did badly answering some of the questions and the CIO (an old man) looked grumpy and seemed that he didn’t care about what I had to say after the first 4 questions, in fact, he wasn’t even paying attention and was just straight laughing as I tried my best… Although I mentioned I enjoy doing this kind of work, the old guy said it’s not a fun job and will be stressful which I totally understand. However, in the first interview, the recruiter mentioned that he wanted someone to enjoy doing the work and doesn’t want a lazy person who just clocks in and clocks out and treats it as a 9-5 job.
 Should I just withdraw from the job posting rather than getting a rejection email? In my opinion, I felt disrespected and insulted because of this… Although I can take plenty of hits, the job workplace culture seemed toxic, especially because it’s just 2 employees the head of the department and a regular security analyst.

                              <span>Sorry if this is an unorthadox post, but is there a way to get the latest (or last) SPP for older HPE Proliant Gen8/9 servers that are no longer under HPE Support? Getting this from HPE is not an option. Is there a repository somewhere, lets say for &quot;testing and lab use only&quot; that would have SPP bundles for older Gen8 and Gen9 Proliant servers.
 Or is it possible to download the firmware individually from HPE or any other source? My 3rd party hardware maintenance vendor will not provide any firmware - although I know they have it.

                              <span>I work for a hardware vendor. Businesses/customer buy our hardware (multimillion dollar capex equipment), generate petabytes of data on it yearly and they need to get the data from our hardware onto their network for subsequent analysis. 
 Now whenever my company needs to connect our hardware to your network, IT inevitably must get involved.
 The biggest pushback is that my company’s hardware cannot be managed by the customers IT infrastructure whatsoever. (No domain joining, or any kind of endpoint protection). We expressly state in the purchase agreement that the equipment is managed and supported by my company.
 Our equipment is meant to be a single user device and has no need to contact the outside internet. Connecting to any network is only necessary for transferring the data collected. Technically, we have a samba server running on the equipment, and that single (or maybe the small group) of users have the credentials. 
 Would you then describe the equipment as an “appliance” (cannot be managed by policy)?
 Is this a common scenario in your company (you have an outside vendors equipment wanting to connect to your network)?
 What would you require (or assuage your security concerns) from the vendor? 
 In most cases I’ve told folks that they can secure the VLAN (firewalls, routing) by restricting what resources the equipment can access when connected to their network, but it seems like I have to go five levels deep in their organization to get this to happen.

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeing several jobs advertising &quot;On Call.&quot;
 While I know what the words mean, I cannot picture what an On call pay structure is like.
 Is it like being an Uber for helpdesk calls or something? Does it mean that you are paid per call, or for the hours that you are on call?
 Reason I ask is because I have a decent job in another field.. I desperatly want to get into IT and am willing to pay my dues.. but not go into bankruptcy for the first few years that I&#x27;d be entry level. My perfect situation would be a job that&#x27;s 3-5 hours a day that I could work before or after my present job.
 I&#x27;ve tried part time.. what a joke. The part time positions want 40-45 hours a week.. they just claim part time to not pay benefits.

                              <span>Currently, we have a situation where we have a CNX file that connects to a database in a specific folder. I attempted to modify this file by changing the database name and saved the CNX file. However, the saved CNX file still contained the old database name. To fix this issue, I deleted the original CNX file and attempted to create a new one. However, when I tried to save the new CNX file, the file editor showed that the CNX file already existed in the folder, even though I could not find the file in the folder. To investigate further, I created a new folder with the same name as the original folder. However, when I tried to create a new CNX file in the new folder, the file editor showed that a CNX file already existed in the empty folder.
 I am unsure why this issue is occurring, as I have checked APPDATA to ensure there are no old files causing the issue. Do you have any ideas as to what may be causing this problem?
 -Tried searching APPDATA for old information to delete -Deleted the old folder and created the same folder name, but this showed a ghost CNX file in the newly created folder.

 Currently dealing with a delicate genius (Seinfeld) who drags on tasks because they are too afraid to ask for help. No type of troubleshooting skills. If they do not understand it, it is automatically considered misconfigured or wrong and should be removed.
 If you dont understand VMWare, its fine. Find someone who does. Dont assume taking a class for a week automatically makes you an expert.
 You know how god awful it is to hear them say how difficult it is to apply a certificate to a ESXi host.

                              <span>I am looking for an ID printer, used because I can&#x27;t afford one brand new. 
 A lot of them are discontinued. Can anyone here tell me what exactly that means? What disadvantages or problems does that create. Will I still be able to purchase things needed to keep it running? Is buying a good working model that&#x27;s discontinued worth it? Thanks.

                              <span>Posting this here since I work as a sysadmin for a mid-large sized company. A manager for the region in which I live asked if we had a technology vendor for disposal of equipment. I happen to have a desire to do this on the side and had started a very small website/advertisement in my area expressing this. I guess my question is: is there any danger in suggesting my own company as a vendor for my job? Much of the collection work can be outsourced so there’s no danger of anyone really seeing me collecting the equipment.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a Windows system administrator for the past 10 years at a small company, but as the solo IT guy here, there was never a need for me to keep up with the latest standards and technologies as long as my stuff worked.
 All the servers here are Windows 2012 R2 and I&#x27;m familiar with Hyper-V, Active Directory, Group Policies, but I use the GUI for almost everything and know only a few basic Powershell commands. I was able to install and set up a pfSense firewall on a VM and during COVID I was able to set up a VPN server on it so that people could work remotely, but I just followed a YouTube tutorial on how to do it.
 I feel I only have a broad understanding of how everything works which usually allows me to figure out what I need to Google to find the specific solution, but it gives me deep imposter syndrome. Is there a certification I should go for or a test somewhere that I can take to see where I stand?
 I want to leave this company to make more money elsewhere, but before I start applying elsewhere, what skills should I brush up on that I would be expected to know? 
 Thanks.

 Wondering if any of you prefer anything in particular over cPanel/WHM?
 Edit
 I&#x27;m a bit of a control freak and like to build my Apache, PHP and MySQL from source. I&#x27;m willing to give that up.

 What is your go to system for a rugged laptop with Cell capabilities? We&#x27;ve been put in a pickle and need to find something relatively quick(in stock sku). Usage is fairly light, timeline is tight and ethernet/wifi is abysmal at best so looking for something with 4G or 5G.

                              <span>I was working with a department within my organization that is utilizing a vendor provided web app. In order to get SSO to work correctly in MS Edge, we need to add login.microsoftonline.com to the EMIE mode as a neutral entity (open in: none).
 We have several other web apps using that for SSO, so I fear that it could impact those apps. In theory, it shouldnt because it’s neutral, but wanted to check to see if any other people knew more.

                              <span>Hello everyone! We have two HPE MSA 1050s and we want to replicate the data from the first one onto the second one, while keeping both as separate entities. Additionally, our boss would like to be able to access the data and create a backup on an external drive or something. We are part of the maintenance team, but we are not experts in this device, and we were asked to create backups using just the manuals as guidance. We have tried using snapshots and copying volumes, but those methods do not meet the requirement of having a backup that can be accessed from other devices like an external drive (since it only creates a snapshot or volume copy in the disks that belong to disk groups within the same MSA). So the question would be, how can we make this? Is there a way or is it just what it is?
 We know that in case of a disk failure the spares will take over and replace the degraded one, but that it not enough for our boss, he is convinced everything will break at the same time and we will end up losing ALL the data.

                              <span>We have a helpdesk that only serves internal customers, but I feel like we do a good job of being engaged and helpful. I think most of us who manage a helpdesk do the same yet I often get an escalation from one of our tier one folks that boils down to, &quot;this vendor&#x27;s support is refusing to help.&quot;

                              <span>I hear it all the time -- network, network, network. It&#x27;s the only way you get the job. If you&#x27;re applying to jobs online, you&#x27;re wasting your time, bla bla bla.
 But how do you actually network to get a job? I&#x27;ve asked all my friends, and the responses I get are either &quot;we&#x27;re not hiring,&quot; or (most common response) &quot;I&#x27;m a low level accountant at a Fortune 500 company, don&#x27;t know anyone in IT, sorry.&quot; 
 A lot of my friends are either software engineers, or work in finance. I am looking for IT support and sysadmin jobs jobs. The only friends I have in those careers work for companies which do not have any current job openings. 
 So, how do I get a job this way? It&#x27;s frustrating because I know for a fact I&#x27;ve been passed over for several jobs because someone else had an in.

 I am learning my way around AD and noticed that if an user is logged in to a workstation and needs admin rights for a task, only by typing ‘.\admin’ as the user works but not simply ‘admin’ (followed by the password of course). 
 Could someone explain why?

 Anybody have any good suggestions?

                              <span>Several customers with Microsoft 365 / Office 365 can no longer use Office for Mac after an update. After successful activation of the Office installation, Office switches back to unlicensed. Trying to activate Office again ends in the error message: It occurs if you&#x27;re already signed in through a different Microsoft 365 user account in the same organization.
 We have already reset the licenses with the License Removal Tool, cleaned up the keychain, removed Office completely, obtained it from the App Store and even installed the previous March version. All unfortunately unsuccessful. 
 Since it now affects three Microsoft 365 tenants, we can&#x27;t be alone with the problem. Does anyone else have similar issues or information from Microsoft? 
 I would be grateful for any hints.

                              <span>My organization is looking at putting Tableau Reader on 1000+ machines. Apparently there is no way to disable the registration page on first launch. Have you found that there is a way to automate the process or eliminate it for the users on a large scale? We need to put this on every machine, and my leadership hates the page. They also don&#x27;t want to have to send/receive data for security reasons if we do not need to.
 https://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/disabling-registration-in-reader
 Note, I have found a way to prefill the registration page with data via registry (HKEY Local User). Not the best answer but at least they would only have to hit 1 button. Anything that we can do before install or before issues a system would be appreciated. It does require it per user login at this time, but only once.

                              <span>Hey all.
 Is there anyone here who has migrated all their compute FROM AWS TO On-Prem?
 We currently have all our servers (AD, SQL, ERP, File Shares, etc.) on an AWS VPC. We would like to bring all that compute back to our on-prem data center. We will be hosting all those virtualized servers on VMWare vSphere.
 I could find a lot of write-up and documentation on how move from on-prem to AWS, but nothing to do the reverse.
 Has anyone done this? What do I need to be aware of? What are the risks? Is there a standard process?
 Hence this post.
 Any and all help greatly appreciated.

                              <span>About 2 weeks ago there was a post about a free MDM for windows machines that a lot of people chimed in that it worked great, and the pricing wasn&#x27;t bad. I recall the post being about &#x27;is it too good to be true&#x27; type of thing.
 Im looking at MDM solutions for a company about 120 machines, and Im interested in putting it in the mix to see pricing/features, but for the life of me, I cannot find it. I swore I saved it in Reddit, but cannot find it after searching for 20 minutes. 
 Hoping someone can point me in the right direction on this, as I want to give them a fair shake.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m one of two IT employees at a small company. In terms of Employees we have probably about 75 and PC&#x27;s about the same amount.
 We are looking into an IT Ticketing/Service Management system because as of right now we have no system to speak of. When users have issues, they come get us, and with the amount of work starting to pick up, it&#x27;s starting to become an issue
 The main features that we are looking for are
  
A Ticketing system (pretty self explanatory)
 A system with some sort of knowledge base so we can centralize our Documentation
 Asset Management to keep track of all hardware that we manage
 Some sort of remote assistance tool that isn&#x27;t VPN/RDP based. (We have multiple sets over an hour apart and it become a real pain when we need to do any sort of support to the other site)
  
What&#x27;s the best way to go about getting all of the features? is there any system/software that has these features(but wont break the bank)? 
 Would it make more sense or be more cost effective if we were to look for multiple tools to do all of these things?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve worked with TopDesk before at a previous job, but that&#x27;s about it for experience with these systems
 Any ideas would be appreciated, Thanks!

                              <span>This may seem stupid, but I&#x27;ve gone into analysis paralysis.
 I can&#x27;t decide how to design the network in a new office. I am going to designate entire /16 for it, but I can&#x27;t decide how to carve out specific subnets. I&#x27;m thinking of doing something like:
 VLAN 10 - 10.50.10.0/23
 VLAN 20 - 10.50.20.0/24
 VLAN 30 - 10.50.30.0/24
 and so on. I can&#x27;t yet decide whether it&#x27;s a stupid idea to let subnets follow VLAN tags, and to left out such big chunks unassigned and unused, or whether I should go with my gut feeling and just do what feels natural and easy to manage overall. I&#x27;m the sole administrator here. We will hire more people for 1st line support in the future, so I&#x27;m keen to keep things simple and descriptive.
 I&#x27;ve always been supporting what&#x27;s already there, adding things into existing environments setup by people before me. I&#x27;ve never had an opportunity like that, to setup a completely new office from the ground up, so I feel paralysed by the sheer number of possibilities. I am clearly overthinking this, I know.

 I would start with a simple request like, &quot;If I don&#x27;t receive an email from Bob by 10 am send him a follow-up to ask about the status of the contract we are working on.&quot;
 I know I have all the pieces to build this on my own but thought I would see if anybody has found something already to do this.

                              <span>Hello sysadmins,
 I have an issue I can&#x27;t seem to figure out. My org had an On-Prem Exchange server that they decommissioned several years back (before my time) when they moved to a hybrid Azure environment. All mail is Exchange Online now.
 When they started syncing users to Azure/O365, they left many of the current employees with a &quot;company.local&quot; UPN Suffix, as opposed to &quot;company.com.&quot; They also left all the msExch* attributes in tact.
 I recently implemented Conditional Access policies for MFA, and they wanted employees on site to be able to use a Hybrid-Joined computer in lieu of the MFA verification.
 So I set that up, but we discovered that it didn&#x27;t work for some users. I found that it was due to the &quot;company.local&quot; UPN discrepancy between local AD and Azure (which had &quot;company.com&quot; as the Azure UPN). I switch the suffix and it fixed the CA issue.
 Director says to move everyone to the correct suffix to make it work, so I did that. Since the UPN&#x27;s match, every user&#x27;s msExch attributes are linked correctly in Exchange Online. 
 Users now show this error in the admin.microsoft.com portal, under their Mail tab: This user&#x27;s on-premises mailbox hasn&#x27;t been migrated to ‎Exchange Online‎. The ‎Exchange Online‎ mailbox will be available after migration is completed.
 These user&#x27;s already had a mailbox, and it seems that most of them have no issues using mail still. We did have one user who&#x27;s mailbox disappeared, I removed the msExchMailboxGuid and other related attributes from their local AD account, and had to remove and reassign their Exchange Online license. This created a new mailbox for them, but it is a fresh mailbox and does not have any previous mail in it.
 I changed the Sync Rules in AD Connect to push NULL out for the msExchMailboxGuid for all users, and it did sync the NULL value for everyone. But the error is still there over a day later.
 Is there any way to resolve this without losing everyone&#x27;s mailbox?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I am currently trying to pass 5 NVMe disks to a storage VM as a passthrough device. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find the right option in the BIOS that allows this. The NVMes are attached to this controller: &quot;HPE MR416i-a Gen10+&quot;. Of course I didn&#x27;t create a logical drive and the disks are marked as JBODs.
 I know from an old server that you can mark the NVMe as PT-Enabled and then you can select it as a PCI device in the VM settings.
 Does anyone have any idea what the appropriate setting is and where to find it? Thank you very much!
 Regards,
 Chris

                              <span>Been working in IT for over 25 years and I think I&#x27;m done. Got into it by accident - I was good at Excel, and moved up via tech support, service desk management, architecture, general jack of all trades and eventually into Senior Sys admin roles.
 Tbh I just don&#x27;t have the interest anymore - I&#x27;d rather be doing something practical and more creative and maybe even, and I never thought I&#x27;d say it, something that involves more interaction with people. Has anybody successfully transitioned to a different type of role. What skills would you say are transferable and what skills sysadmins usually posess have you found employers appreciate in other roles?

 The main task is to mask data in a testing environment. Virtual Data Pipeline (VDP) is not a mandatory feature.

 Most of time or at early time, this was quite straight forward to follow instructions but as the website has been developed with multiple pages, now we need subdomains and custom domains etc. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable updating this so I&#x27;ve been asking to external developers. But I think it would be beneficial for organisation who has a good understanding and for my role as well
 Can someone please share some solid or practical resources I can refer to, it would be super appreciated for your support.

 i am stuck. And kinda out of ideas.
 I need to move some vms from vmware to hyperv. Simple question: how?
 Ive tried a few ways I&#x27;ve found on google but it didn&#x27;t seem to work.
 Anyone of you did something similar in the past and got some tips for me?

                              <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m sorry for what might seem like a dumb question. 
 In my day to day work I make tools for myself in python to make my job more easy and efficient and in some cases enjoyable. some of my coworkers have seen some of these tools and asked to get the tools as well.
 In the past it has not been an issue to use something like autopytoexe to convert my script to an executable that my colleagues could use but as security becomes a bigger concern restrictions on user machines naturally becomes stricter, something, I&#x27;m all for.
 However one of these restrictions is that antivirus now has gone from &quot;I recognize this software as a virus because x,y,z&quot; to &quot;I don&#x27;t recognize this software as a safe software&quot;.
 I understand this move completely as it makes it more difficult to obscure your virus, even if it confuses me a little bit that it doesn&#x27;t treat excel macro&#x27;s and bat files the same (I mean I know exactly why but I find the compromise frustrating).
 Is there a smart way to legitimize a piece of software I wrote for a small team of about 30 people without compromising security or teaching the users that &quot;it&#x27;s ok to open exe files as long as its from someone I trust&quot;?
 Submitting the software for review with our antivirus provider and Microsoft is time consuming and expensive, and I have some concern with installing python on users machines.
 I could make some of the tools web accessible but that adds significant development time and a tool made to start with windows and remind you to stand up once in a while wouldn&#x27;t work as a web application.

                              <span>Hi. I dont see option 7 when trying to configure automatic updates. 
 ​
  
7 &#x3D; Notify for install and notify for restart. (Windows Server only)
 With this option from Windows Server 2016, applicable only to Server SKU devices, local administrators will be allowed to use Windows Update to proceed with installations or reboots manually.
  
Forgive me for being stupid, but my Google searches arent throwing up the reference material im after. From reading it seems that this is specific to 2016 and Im guessing the reason I dont see this option is because my domain is aging (2012 functional level) and we&#x27;re only getting round to upgrading OS&#x27;s now SO perhaps the relevant ADMX files arent there. 
 This stems from an unexplained reboot relating to windows updates on a test 2016 VM - we&#x27;ve been advised to use option 7 ... so I wanted to test this to see what it looks like.
 Id be grateful for a reference to back this up?

 Users are able to create folders in &quot;C:\Users\username\tenant&quot;, and these folders show in the company folder in the OneDrive client, but they&#x27;re not synced. Users can store a ton of documents there and expect them to be backuped, etc.
 Any way to block or disable this?

 Assume for security &amp; monitoring purpose; I used serial/console ports to connect all the switches to optical converters in a datacenter. I will now Mux/Demux the fiber optic connection to 20/30km remote location. Are my switches secure ? Also is it also a right way to do it?

                              <span>I heard that even for a SysAdmin CCNA is really important, and i can see why is that. So my questions is, if im mostly interested in VMware, Veeam backup, storage, Exchange on prem admin, Endpoint protection, is it worth getting a CCNA as first cert? I work for an MSP that does a lot of networking work, so i think it will come in handy..

                              <span>Hi All!
 We&#x27;re trying out CodeTwo&#x27;s MS365 signatures and I&#x27;m going to have to update everybody&#x27;s profile info so that the placeholders can be populated on the signatures. I don&#x27;t want to update all the info within Azure AD and then preform a sync from on-prem at a later date and have it all wiped out (is that correct?)
 Currently there is no sync between our on-prem AD Servers (2) and Azure.
 I was going to setup the Azure AD Cloud Sync but had a few questions I need help with:
  
Am I correct in saying that the sync is 1-way only, on-prem to Azure? So I make all changes on-prem?
 Will there be any interference with our MS365 email accounts once the initial sync has completed, as we use different passwords for AD and Emails.
 Any other gotcha&#x27;s I need to watch out for? 
  
Thank you.

                              <span>A storage pool was using SSD as a cache tier and HDD for capacity, with read-only data. SSD burned out, literally. Is it possible to access the data on the HDD? Since SSD was only a cache for read-only data, all of the data should be on the HDD just fine. But I cannot figure out how to get to it. The data is available in offside backup, so no big deal if it&#x27;s impossible, but would be great to avoid the pain of restoring a massive remote backup, given that all the data should be on the hdd.

 How do I clear the config of a switchport on a cisco switch? I&#x27;ve tried every command on the internet however I am unable to do it. See ssh output below when I try to use &quot;default interface ge20&quot;. I have a teams VOIP phone that seems to add a ton of configuration to a switchport upon connection which I want to remove.

                              <span>Hi
 I would like to force our users to run Edge with English language but I need European decimal seperator.
 I need it to look like this: 1.000,25
 When choosing English US or UK I get
 1,000.25
 which is confusing for the users.
 Directly in Windows you can choose English European which does this correct, are there a similar language in Edge?

 We have a system that is published as a bunch of RemoteApps on RDS server.
 It was requested to be built for our own users, and is working fine for that purpose.
 Now they have requested another external company gain access to this system as well.
 Any suggestions on how to solve this task? I can&#x27;t imagine creating AD users for every employee from the other company and allowing them access that way through.
 RemoteApps and RDS servers is not a field I&#x27;m very familiar with, so I don&#x27;t know what options I have. I have heard about Azure AD Application Proxy before, could that be a solution or is that for something else entirely?
 Best regards.

                              <span>Are you aware of any company that can do the following: 
  
Supports crawling and indexing file, block, and object storage to extract files&#x27; metadata.
 Supports crawling any vendor’s storage.
 Supports crawling all major file systems and protocols (POSIX-compliant, NFS, CIFS, iSCSI etc.).
 Runs completely on-prem without sending metadata outside of the company&#x27;s environment.
 Crawls billions of files over NFS in an efficient manner without overloading underlying storage infrastructure.
 Crawls and indexes the entire environment on a regular basis such as daily etc.
  
I found few solutions on the Internet but wanted to hear your suggestions and preferably experiences that you had with them.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello, I have come across an issue with our Windows 365 VMs. We have McAfee Proxy installed on our workstations which includes W365 and Physical Devices. We come across an intermittent issue with upgrade issues with our W365 VMs where it fails to upgrade and the logs are not very helpful. We opened a ticket with MS and they stated McAfee Proxy is causing the issue but cannot explain why it is not happening on our physical devices. We tested uninstalling MCP on at least 5 failed VMs and it allows to upgrade successfuly to Windows 11.
 I am checking to see if anyone else experienced this? MS provided me this link today to have them whitelisted in MCP so I will try that step next Connection endpoints for Windows 11 Enterprise - Windows Privacy | Microsoft Learn

I&#x27;ve heard the bank of questions for this exam is pretty extensive and to my surprise that this exam is all multiple choice questions with no actual CLI simulation questions. I was just curious if anyone had taken this exam recently and could verify that? Also, any tips on studying for this particular exam would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Brother being a brand that has worked well for us, wouldn&#x27;t mind having a label printer by them. I cant however seem to figure out which one of their label printers will meet all my criteria. I appreciate any recommendations: 
  
Wireless interface so that multiple PCs can print to the same label printer
 Be reliable and durable
 Able to use generic cheap labels
 Budget friendly (Preferably under $300usd)

 Had a client call in saying their workstation swapped and renewed its IP address which should have been reserved in Unifi and all the software it hosts couldn&#x27;t be accessed. 
 The client is fairly tech savy and had gone to look at the IPV4 setting at Settings &gt; ethernet and noticed the Ip setting said manual. Their theory is the reservation wasn&#x27;t moved to the new MAC address when this workstation was replaced about 6 months ago, and static was set up in Windows.

 I am trying to reflect this by using ncclient. Assuming I&#x27;d be using ncclient.manager.connect.get(), how would I request an entire data model from a device? 
 I have tried creating an xml filter with just the xmlns of the desired model, but that doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Are there any network engineers that have this cert?
 I don&#x27;t need it for work, but I&#x27;m wondering if reading the study guide is worth it to get a better grasp on wireless standards/best practices, etc...
 Wireless in the office is mainly for web surfing and emails and I deal with a lot of pt to pt wireless links for IP cameras in some remote work locations. The pt to pt links are under 1000 ft and as long as the radios are configured properly and have LOS they basically link up and work, but I don&#x27;t understand 80% of the settings in the wireless radio settings.
 I&#x27;m not looking to become a wireless expert, but it seems that there is more to wifi than adding APs and moving closer to the AP. Yes, there is a thing as too many APs, I was just giving an example.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been studying up on MAC addresses recently, specifically the Universal/Local bit that Apple and Android take advantage of for MAC randomization.
 RFC 7042 says:
  
OUIs and longer MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit zero and the Group bit unspecified.
  
But seems to contradict itself one paragraph later.
  
If the Local bit is on, the holder of an OUI has no special authority over MAC identifiers whose first 3 octets correspond to their OUI.
  
In my mind, it only makes sense that all OUIs would be assigned with U/L bit set to 0, however I see many examples of OUIs that have the U/L bit set to 1:
  
02:C0:8C - 3COM
 02:70:B3 - DATA RECALL LTD.
 02:9D:8E - CARDIAC RECORDERS, INC.
 02:70:B0 - M/A-COM INC. COMPANIES
 AA:00:04 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:07:01 - RACAL-DATACOM
 AA-00-00 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:BB:01 OCTOTHORPE CORP.
  
... among others.
 Why is it that some OUIs have been assigned with the local bit set to 1? Is this just a mistake by the IEEE Registration Authority? Are addresses that start with these assigned OUI prefixes still LAAs or would they be considered UAAs? If I&#x27;m generating LAAs, do I need to avoid using these assigned OUI prefixes?

 I want to make sure that when I am installing I don’t exceed the cables bend radius.
 Anyone have any recommendations on bend radius gauges? 
 I found a few cheap ones on amazon which seem like they would fit the job, but I wanted to get other recommendations in case there was a better option.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have an old 3560 that we use as our external router. We finally upgraded our ISP to over 500mbps, so I need to swap the switch out. We have 2 ASA behind that in standby pair.
 I inherited this network, and sure enough I don’t have any internal information on it or what the running / startup config right now, I’ll need to console into the switch to see.
 I have some 2960’s around, but I’m a bit rusty here.
 It looks like it has 12.2(58)SE1-ip-serv-crypto running on it.
  
The “IP-Serv-Crypto” is the Layer 3 routing part of iOS? I’ll need to get a license for the 2960 and flash the new image to just to use one of my old switches on hand if what I’m assuming is correct. But that seems like it would be better to just acquire a new switch.
 
What would you guys / gals recommend if purchasing something new? I’m seeing the new “Cisco Business” stuff popping around.
 
 I appreciate any advice.
 Thanks!

 I know to measure convergence I need to send ping packets across the network. (Do I count the packet loss as convergence?). can I do this with wireshark (I have no idea how to use it but I&#x27;ve watched a few youtube videos)
 for packet loss, i think I can figure it out with wireshark. however any other help is welcomed 
 how do i measure delay?
 please help!

Not sure if 4100/4400 is better for IDF/Edge switching, and 4650 is more of a 9500 replacement. Thoughts?

 Generally, a break-fix case is straightforward in that something is broken and you need to weed out information about the problem to fix it. Most systems are already in place, nothing new (generally) needs to be built/designed, or implemented. Anything new is usually ephemeral, required only for the duration of the troubleshooting, and generally doesn&#x27;t have the same &quot;will this scale&quot; scrutiny applied. 
 I&#x27;m struggling to a degree with the Project side of things where you effectively get a wall of text from a Customer (Requirements, Demands, current/future state, Access required) all jumbled up into a little story with a whole heap of pleasantries, and thinking about how I break this down into something I can track, how I can assign or verify certain pieces with other teams, etc. 
 Right off the bat, Emails and Tickets are a task at breaking down possibly hundreds of small subtasks and requests into something that can be actioned (Intertwined with spelling/grammar and sometimes confusing sentences). 
 How does everyone do it? Do you start with kick-off meetings first, do you try to break down their initial correspondence into something like Trello or Excel and track all of the different points? Does anyone have a system for taking requests, pondering on them for a bit and effectively getting tasks/deliverables and questions from them to progress a project?

                              <span>Hello All!
 I&#x27;m quite new to IP transit and Peering but I have a few questions and if you could confirm if my understanding is correct?
 ​
 #IP Transit
 IP Transit would be to access the provider&#x27;s peers, So for example, if I was with HE, I could connect to Comcast customers but not Comast&#x27;s peers? 
 However, Arelion shows additional peers on the BGP Report? Which means I could also connect to GTT customers?
 ​
 #Peering
 Peering wise, I know peering with content providers like Netflix can be highly beneficial, however, how does it work if you peer with an IP transit provider?
 ​
 So if I peered with HE, I would be able to connect to their customers but not their peers, so no connection to Comcast customers? 
 ​
 #Peering Customers
 Customer-wise, would that be companies that have gotten IP transit with HE?
 If I&#x27;m peering with HE that means to connect to me via HE you would need their IP transit? So would I be considered a peer of HE or is it more complicated?
 ​
 Is that the case for most IP transit providers that offer peering? 
 I&#x27;m not sure if there are some providers that may only peer their own ASN but require IP Transit to reach the rest of their network or customers on their IP transit service.

                              <span>Hi,
 I know this is a long shot but maybe the solution is right in front of my eyes.
 I need to evaluate the number of links needed to interconnect my X routers. While I want to minimize the number of links, I want to be sure that there is a shortest path of at most Y hops and a backup path of at most Y+Z hops.
 I use variables (X, Y and Z) so I can simulate multiple scenarios.
 I have been trying to implement that on NetworkX but cannot find the right way to do it. I suppose it needs a mathematician&#x27;s brain that I do not have.
 How would you solve this problem?
 Cheers

                              <span>Hey all, 
 Looking for a bit of confirmation on something I am trying to resolve with regards to DNS. A number of FW vendors (Fortinet, Cisco, Palo etc) offer a feature where a DNS record can be inspected that the reply amended to provide a different result, for example to give an internal client a different IP address. 
 I am trying to understand which vendors support the translation of the additional records field within an SRV record. It looks like all can successfully translate A records etc. 
 With an SRV record, it will usually contain in the answer an FQDN in the reply. As the FQDN needs to be resolved anyway, rather than wait for the requestor to send another A-Record translation request the SRV record will often pre-empt this and include the response to the A-Record lookup in its additional records data. (So even though the client hasn&#x27;t expressly asked for it, it gets given it anyway)
 Particular interest in Cisco ASA - anyone know if the ASA can translate the information that is presented in the additional records field of DNS?
 Cheers
 J

                              <span>I am working on reducing/getting rid of SPOFs in our environment.
 Firewalls are 2x Watchguard M270 Switches are 2x USW-PRO-24
 I am not a network admin so I am a bit out of my depth, I think I am on the right track but I would like a sanity check
 A crude drawing of my setup here:
 https://i.imgur.com/1ztQUCX.png
 Currently my setup is as above with the exception of the green coloured lines/X, what I want to do is wire up so my switches are fully redundantly connected with the firewalls, as I currently have servers connected to the switches but if SWITCH1 dies we lose internet/VLAN routing.
 So, in short:
  
add new interface to watchguard cluster (so one new port on each FW)
 connect both of those ports to SWITCH2
 delete the current line between SWITCH1 and SWITCH2
  
Would love some input if this looks alright or if I am about to create a loop and what I should do instead.

                              <span>Can anyone tell me why a PTZ camera I purchased boots on my Cisco 3560G-24PS (802.3af) but not on either of my small PoE switches (Netgear GS308P, TP-Link TL-SF1008P) that are rated the same 15.4w as the Cisco and also say 802.3af? The camera spec says 15w max and says PoE 802.3af as well. The camera power lights just come on dimly and fade out every few seconds like it&#x27;s not getting enough power on the small switches but as far as I know, they are rated for the same spec as the Cisco. I run a few security cameras off both small switches so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about the Cisco over the other switches. The only thing I can think of is that the Cisco might be sending power before negotiation completes or the small ones have some issue negotiating and don&#x27;t deliver power long enough for it to complete.

 We are getting nowhere with just having a case open and calling them for follow ups.
 All they are giving us they are looking into it.
 ​
 Any idea how to proceed with escalation?

                              <span>I joined a small start-up about 3 months ago. In the interview, I was promised &quot;a good and friendly team you can rely on&quot;. After joining, everything was going well. I was getting used to work culture, learning their procedures and after a month or two, I had a pretty good handle on things. In fact, I was able to learn/understand a lot of processes/tools without proper training or documentation. According to my manager &quot;I am grasping everything very well&quot; and he was pretty happy with my work here. 
 A month and a half after joining, my manager resigned and my teammate(same level and working 8 months longer than me in the company) became the lead and his attitude changed drastically after becoming my manager. Yesterday he told me I had to inform him if I am off my desk even for 5 minutes 🤯 anyway We are now only 2 people in the team. Him &amp; me. We manage helpdesk and infrastructure. 
 A week ago I asked him if I can start work half an hour early and finish early only on Mondays so that I can take my 11-month-old kid to swimming classes. I thought it was simple request and out of nowhere he told me NO because as a helpdesk/sysadmin team, we are supposed to support 9 to 5. I agreed with him and asked if he can cover for the last 30 minutes and again, the answer was NO. 
 So today I set up a meeting and asked the same thing to the senior manager and he told me &quot;because we had a couple of departures from our team, he can&#x27;t give me that flexibility. And there are no plans to hire anyone anytime soon.&quot; 
 I mean, 2 people already left in last 2 months (my manager and another colleague), are you ready to lose another just for this one small request?(I guess they are lol)
 Anyways I guess it&#x27;s time to start looking for another job. tbh, in my 10 years of career, I never had to choose between my family and my job. I always thought teammates help when needed.
 TL;DR: workplace indirectly asked me to choose between family and job

 We have some obscure Windows application which can only be installed with the installer it was installed with. 
 Problem is, our previous sys admin removed all the older packages. 
 The Windows app received about 7 updates and we only have the 3 latest installer versions. So for some people with older versions, the apps could not be removed. 
 Tried using msiexec with GUID and msiexec in combination with the latest installers. Not works. 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated!
 We are using SCCM btw.

 What fun stuff do u guys do to remind users to always lock their workstations if stepping away from their desks?
 We do have a GPO policy to lock after 15 mins of inactivity.

                              <span>Hello, curious how you all would handle this.
 Currently we have some servers that require starting applications up after a restart or verification that the application did not break after windows updates. This also includes taking snapshots.
 Due to that we are updating some servers manually and it takes quite some time to do it after hours. 
 Is this just a grin and bear it solution if the vendor doesn&#x27;t have a way to automate the task?
 The only half solution I can think of is to schedule snapshots and schedule updates and then still do the manual portion before opening hours rather than after. I just wonder if most people work this way or if servers needing touched after restarts are less common.

                              <span>Right now in our environment it is a choatic mess with printers...everyone has their own weird printer, from small epsons, canons, lexmark etc., you name it, on top of our huge Konica Minoltas and Epson C20600 (At least I think it is by epson iirc, I&#x27;d have to look at the notes I took again).
 As these printers die out I want to eventually bring in brother printers since I have heard good things about them, but I&#x27;m not sure how we should have our setup work.
 What I mean is, we spend so much money in various inks and it is a mess, outside of the ones we have auto managed for our surgery center.
 I was thinking that in order to save money, we have specific locations that have their own small printers, and perhaps incorporate large ones for regular workers like our call center and MA&#x27;s area.
 But I also heard that having everyone get up and having to go get their stuff can cause delays with patients etc.
 What do you guys think? There&#x27;s got to be a way to slowly move us in the direction of unity where everyone has the same brand, and also not spend thousands of dollars for all these different inks??
 At a loss on this one and I would love senior opinions from those more experienced than me.
 I appreciate it!

                              <span>So if I have a group of users who should be able to occasionally execute programs as Administrator, but who I do not want to just log in as admin every day, I have thought of making a second account for them. So user &quot;jdoe&quot; would be a regular user, but &quot;jdoe-a&quot; would have Administrator rights.
 The thinking is that you could not log into a machine as &quot;jdoe-a&quot;, but you can log in as &quot;jdoe&quot; and when it prompts for an Administrator password to escalate privileges for something, the user could think first and then enter &quot;jdoe-a&quot; credentials if appropriate.
 Is this advisable? How can I accomplish this with AD Users and Computers and/or Group Policy?
 Thank you

 We naively thought a single 3080 and some dp to hdmix2 adapters would cover the need.
 Turns out Nvidia GTX/RTX cards are capped at 4 displays.
 Nice new machine is going back in the box and back to Dell.

 This just started happening to me. A job got posted in my area and no less than 20 companies out of India all called me within the first hour of the job posting. Some of them at the same time. I have added my own to the list and made a github page as suggested by u/not_a_lob
 Github: https://github.com/SirKratosAurion/ITJobSpam
 If you come across something not on the list feel free to open an issue and I will review it.
 thanks to u/Elranzer for the original posting
 Edit: It has come to my attention via a report sent to me on github that a lot of the mail comes from the same &quot;mailed-by&quot; or &quot;signed-by&quot; headers. Gmail does not currently allow us to filter by these.

 I&#x27;m planning on working today but you know gonna be a bit lazy and slow. 
 I have some documents that do need updated but also get the feeling that saying you are updating docs is really a universal term in IT that means you don&#x27;t really feel like working that day and I&#x27;m sure my manager who&#x27;s been in IT for 25 years is well aware of that so I need a better excuse.

                              <span>My supervisor wants me to change our authentication method for MFA from MS Authenticator app to DUO (our current enterprise-wide MFA selection). The goal is to avoid having to use an entirely different application, but I have a feeling Microsoft is going to force us to use their own.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Has anyone connected a Sophos XGS Firewall with the cellular modem add-on to the Telus cellular network in Canada? If so, what plan were you able to use with Telus? Also, what settings did you have to provide them in order to get the unit connected?
 Typically Telus will want the IMEI of the mobile device getting connected but I&#x27;m not able to find that anywhere in the Sophos XGS interface for the cell WAN connection. 
 Any advice or recommendations would be much appreciated!

                              <span>My dear friends, it&#x27;s roughly that time of year again for interns to descend on our departments asking for things they have no business having or asking things they should already know. I&#x27;m reminded of what may be the most socially oblivious intern I&#x27;ve ever come across. 
 For context, I work for a large nationwide company, and my role is a tier 2/3. I also take on a bit of security work, and a bit of networking. Kind of a jack of all trades - I&#x27;m also the only person in my position in my region of the country. Once a quarter everyone on my team gives updates at an all hands meeting, discussing the common issues that have been appearing in our regions and other metrics and things. These are big important meetings that are attended by every level of IT management up to and including the CIO…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks. Hope you&#x27;re doing well. 
 How you guys manage your Linux devices of WFH workforce?
 We have a whole Development team that works from home and uses Linux devices. Something about 15 devices. And, sadly, we don&#x27;t manage any aspect of this devices. We&#x27;re in the dark with it. 
 With Windows devices, we use Defender for Endpoint + Intune, to manage and protect. But for Linux, we don&#x27;t have anything yet. 
 Have any of you used some solution of WSL or Cloud PC to this use case? Or any other solution?
 How it worked out? What was your solutions to this kind of problem? 
 The whole Dev team is remote, so it&#x27;s hard to keep control of the devices, considering that they don&#x27;t have any technician to help them out. 
 Thanks folks :)

 I wanted to reach out to see if anyone had any experience with a door controller that uses a Badge System for employees that also integrates with Active Directory/Azure Active Directory. We are looking for automatic disablement of badges when the account gets deleted/disabled. 
 We are only able to get budget approval if the solution is a fully cloud Native Solution and requires no On-Prem infra. 
 We are currently facing issues with revoking the badge on employee terminations in a timely manner and this is proving to be a potential security/safety risk for the organization. We Currently use A Bosch system that is not up to snuff and the offerings from them require a USB cloud Dongle that requires a server....

                              <span>Hello, we want to secure the connections to our test environment a bit more, my first idea was using the Azure Application Proxy but it seems like this only works with an on-prem AD (can&#x27;t access the RDGW settings without being domain joined), we are only using Azure AD and have no on-prem infrastructure besides our test environment.
 We would like to have 2FA authentication and in the best case a SSO with our azure credentials, does anyone have a recommendation or idea on how to get the app proxy working without having a on-prem ad?
 On the test environment we have various labs with their own domain for product testing and training.

                              <span>Had an issue I could not figure out the answer to, so I thought it would share it here: 
 I&#x27;m creating a custom Windows 10 image in an Amazon-hosted VDI solution called WorkSpaces. 
 We noticed, after cleaning up the image, we ended up inadvertently removing the Windows 10 Store Photo.App. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t connect back to the Windows Store to just reinstall it, so I was trying to install the Photo.App via a DISM command: 
 dism /online /addappxpackpage /packpagepath: /xxxxxx /skiplicense /dependancypackage: xxxxxx , where xxxxxx is the name of the package. 
 I could not find the specific name of the Windows 10 Photo.App package unfortunately. 
 Anyone else had any luck manually reinstalling the Windows Photo.App?

 Water in a DC can never be good...
  
Description: Water intrusion in europe-west9-a has caused a multi-cluster failure and has led to an emergency shutdown of multiple zones. We expect general unavailability of the europe-west9 region. There is no current ETA for recovery of operations in the europe-west9 region at this time, but it is expected to be an extended outage. Customers are advised to failover to other regions if they are impacted.

                              <span>Straight forward process:
  
You send the group a meeting request
  
 You have to say who you want in the meeting
 You have to have an agenda
 You have to justify WHY you need each person. Saying they report to &quot;so and so&quot; is NOT a reason.
  
When the meeting group gets the request they will vet it and see if your meeting is actually needed. If it isn&#x27;t, then they will state the reason why and alternatives that you can do to get the result you need without having a meeting. EVERYONE is subjected to this - even the CEO
 If you try to go around them and host a meeting without their consent - you get sent to HR and they will handle things. You could lose the right to host a meeting, get written up, get a warning or even you could lose your job over this. This includes getting someone else to host the meeting for you when you have been told you are not allowed to host a meeting.
 After the meeting, ALL the folks who attended will be sent a survey to grade the meeting. This is used by the meeting group to grade the host. If the host keeps getting low scores, they are sent to training on how to host a meeting correctly. If they keep getting low scores after that, they are banned from hosting meetings.
 Meetings are by far the worst money waster in a company. Imagine how much could be done if pointless meetings could be eliminated.

                              <span>I have Windows Server 2012 R2 on an ROK license. I want to virtualize the bare metal image on different hardware - I know, the wisdom of this is debateable.
 In this configuration, it will not activate as it is no longer on OEM hardware. Is it possible to buy a new license to and activate the ROK image in a VM with a new key? I also have two Server 2012 R2 VMs, currently running on the exiting 2012 installation. They are again on the ROK license.
 So far the only response I&#x27;ve got from UK resellers is that this is not possible. Are they right?
 Any help would be appreciated.
 Thanks!

 I have RDS server with Windows Server 2016. Is there a way to deactivate the &quot;Updates are available&quot; popup, so that users don&#x27;t see it?
 Things I have already tried:
  
Set the GPO &quot;Allow non-administrators to receive update notifications&quot; beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to disabled (not supported for Windows 10 and so I assume also Server 2016)
 Set the GPO &quot;Remove access to use all Windows Update features&quot; beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to enabled (valid for Server 2016)
 The same GPO beneath User Configuration set to Enabled and &quot;Configure notifications:&quot; set to &quot;0 - Do not show any notifications&quot; (not supported on Windows 10)
  
Is disabling automatic updates the only solution to this problem? (not tested yet)
 How did you implement this? Any idea is appreciated.

 Is there a better way to do it? I don&#x27;t want to restrict sharing completely as we do need to add guests but only want the site owners to do it.

 Our auditors require us to capture evidence of the configuration of our Linux and Unix servers. That could mean capturing the contents of a config file or the output of a command like netstat. Capturing the outputs into a text file would be trivial and easy to script but the auditors are absolutely convinced that these files would be too easy to fake and demand that we capture screenshots instead (yes, I am well aware that screenshots would also be trivial to fake but the only other option is literally have the auditors sit next to us while we page through lines of output and no, I&#x27;m not kidding).
 For context, we are using Windows laptops to connect to various Linux and Unix servers.
 The perfect solution would be a…</span>

 Although the product works for our use case, the level of end user involvement to set up a meeting is a huge deterrent and users have flat out avoided it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Hoping to get some help with my current policy configuration.
 Basically, MFA is enforced (enrolment required and security info registration locked-down to trusted network) but I can&#x27;t seem to get SIF working on Wi-Fi and I&#x27;m prompted immediately when disconnecting from ethernet.
 SIF is the only session control enabled on the &quot;MFA Enforced&quot; policy but not sure why I&#x27;m still being prompted after disconnecting from LAN (trusted location). SIF is set to 60 days and I can sign-in again (going through the standard MFA process, also not seeing the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask again&quot; option which is a good sign) but I&#x27;ll get prompted for MFA again if I join and then leave the LAN same day.
 Wi-Fi public IP is shared with other tenancies in the building so I won&#x27;t add that to trusted locations but I&#x27;d still like SIF to apply regardless of location.
 Been scouring forums but can&#x27;t find cases where they&#x27;re configuring for trusted locations.
 TL;DR - No MFA prompt when on trusted network, MFA prompt immediately when not on trusted network even though SIF is set to 60 days.
 TIA

                              <span>Hi guys
 Hope someone can help us out as we have made a terrible mistake in our team.
 We have a task for every 3 months to reset the krbtgt password twice inside our domain. Normally we would do this like recommended to wait for 24h before doing the second reset and then go our ways until the 3 months mark has been reached. Never had a problem for years. Now today it happened. I reset the password yesterday in the evening and scheduled the second reset for tomorrow as there normally would be no harm to do that even a day afterwards as long as we wait said 24. well what happened. The second admin new to our environment started the second reset this morning thinking that I did not do the first reset today in the morning and now we cannot access our DCs, nor any other server which only allows admin access to them. 
 I saw that one would need to restart every server and afterwards all clients which connect to the domain. Is this true? Or should we already plan for the a recovery plan? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a user whos Outlook crashes when printing email. Only some emails, and the example I was shown this morning is fairly long chain with some screenshots in it. She got her collegue to print it and it worked fine. But her&#x27;s, once the print window appears, that&#x27;s it, print preview is blank, it says connecting to printer but it&#x27;s frozen.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Changing default printer
 Saving attachment to desktop and opening and printing from there
 Outlook in safe mode
 Enabling IE mode in Edge
 Making sure .mht is associated with Edge
 Online Office repair
 Made sure Outlook trust settings aren&#x27;t set to automatically download
 Removing the outlprnt file
  
None of the above made anyu difference. 
 I did try it from OWA, when I opened the email, hit print, it came straight up fine. Then I noticed it was blocking some content, so I allowed that, hit print, it took about 30sec for the print window to load but it did then work fine. 
 I&#x27;m thinking broken link or something like that, but I&#x27;m not sure what else to try?

                              <span>How do you go about preparing systems, if they involve accounts that use an Authenticator app?
 We often set up new systems with all fine details and settings on our own, which are then shipped to the end user so that they can get right back to work with their new system.
 In the past the users gave us their current passwords once and changed it after the work was done. 
 Now Microsoft 365 requires a 2FA on the basis of an authentication app (Microsoft or third-party), which means that we have to go to the user every time we need to sign in, so that they can give us the necessary PINs. 
 Since Microsoft 365 requires a new login quite frequently during setup, it can then happen that we have to keep pestering the users over 1-3 days, our work gets held up if we can&#x27;t reach them, etc.
 Have you found a solution and a reasonable workflow for this?

                              <span>We are way too late, I know. It&#x27;s not up to me.
 There are still two 2008R2 in use, which I want to migrate to 2022 with the Storage Migration Service.
 This does not work because the Powershell version is too low. So I have to install the Windows Management Framework first. As soon as I install the update and then restart the server, the update fails and is undone. In the event logs I get the error code 80070661 and I can&#x27;t find a solution on the net.
 Could it be because we don&#x27;t have Extended Security Updates for 2008R2 servers? 
 Do you have any other idea how I can solve this problem?

                              <span>We have a client that we have to turn on/off email forwarding for specific users, when they are on vacation etc.
 On Exchange online you can just turn it on and off manually. Idea is that i want to make it less of a chore and automate this. For example turn on forwarding emails from user1 to user2 from datetime1 to datetime2.
 Idea is to use scheduler on server and run two scripts. One for turning on and one for turning off. Maybe some kind of gui that create two scripts base on use input and after the second script run, both tasks are deleted?
 Any idea how to proceed with this?

                              <span>I have at home ssh server (no-ip, internal nat, ssh key). I can connect to it via phone and laptop from anywhere. But only when I am on company VPN or on office network, I get &quot;No gssapi security context available&quot; as last event in putty. I see IP and SSH info in event log, so I can connect, just it stops by gssapi. Similar on connectbot from phone when on company wifi network.
 Do you have some recommendation how to mitigate this? Probably some company policy with putty or ssh. I have at home 3D printer and would not like to observe it via phone&#x27;s data and similar for home events.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a software to create a map of an existing IT infrastructure with physical (which system runs on which hardware / platform, connected to which switch, ...) and logical paths (which system has connection to which other system like domain controller, certificate authority, database server, monitoring systems, etc.).
 Long time ago i used whatsup gold for that, i tried to start with visio but there has to be something more useful. Would be nice to be able to select a system and gets highlighted or even in some table all its relations.
 Thanks

                              <span>So we got a situation where we need to find some on-prem documentation software to keep track of a small FAQ, ip stuff, server information, what stuff does, the layout of the land (infrastructure) and all that jazz, i&#x27;ve been looking at a few like dokuwiki (but it seem very prone of wrecking itself when installing some plugins etc)
 I&#x27;de welcome some system that works like a wiki so other contributors can add stuff/modify easily and it should also be able to import stuff from excel / google sheets easily and then be editable.
 opensource is fine, also payed but it needs to be some kind of trial so i can test it and show it off to the rest of the staff.
 What say yee? Suggestions are welcome :)

But focus on the work, maintain positivity, and break the cycle by teaching others the right way. Remember that there are many great people in the IT field, and retaliation only perpetuates the negativity. Keep pushing forward, and eventually, you&#x27;ll gain their respect and prove your worth.

                              <span>I posted this question 5 years ago. Looking to see how answers have changed.
 IPv6 was published as a standard in December 1998. With the 30th anniversary approaching, what has shaken out to be the most accepted way of assigning Addresses in an enterprise environment? 
  
SLAAC + RDNSS
 SLAAC with DHCPv6 for for Domain info
 DHCPv6 with SLAAC only for RA
  
(Yes, I know that Android is still not on the DHCPv6 train, but Windows is on the RDNSS train now, so major changes have happened in the last 5 years.)
 I know the NSA has published a document this January with the following:
 &quot;NSA recommends assigning addresses to hosts via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) server to mitigate the SLAAC privacy issue. Alternatively, this issue can also be mitigated by using a randomly generated interface ID (RFC 4941 – Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Auto-configuration in IPv6) [1] that changes over time, making it difficult to correlate activity while still allowing network defenders requisite visibility &quot; 
 So how are you guys handling address assignment?

I&#x27;ve skimmed the RFCs, and I haven&#x27;t found anything one way or another on whether this is permissible or forbidden (rfc3046 says a relay agent does not add a second relay agent option, but nothing about a second bridge). My expectation is that this should never happen, but at least JTAC seems to think this is fine, despite inconsistent behavior as a result of this. Has anyone else encountered anything like this?

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;m trying to develop a proof of concept for something and it begins with using a virtual Sonicwall Nv270 hosted in azure, and creating an IPSec VPN tunnel interface between the NSv and a remote site.
 I created this VM in line with the Sonicwall best practice which includes using the Marketplace template to stand it up.
 The remote site in question is a Cradlepoint IBR900 Cellular router. We&#x27;ve used a lot of these devices in other deployments - Including - Scenarios where we&#x27;ve deployed physical Sonicwalls in customer data centers and had IPsec tunnels to between them.
 The Azure VM is running Linux CentOS and it has a Public IP which is then bound to the virtual network WAN interface X1 which also has a private IP. 
 The Sonicwall isn&#x27;t aware if it&#x27;s Public IP - The WAN Interface X1 has an IP of 10.1.0.4 and sends traffic out the internet to its DFGW of 10.1.0.1 - I cannot change the WAN Interface IP nor the DFGW which I find really odd. 
 I have by default an NSG inside Azure which I&#x27;ve setup to allow traffic sourced from the Cradlepoint&#x27;s public IP on ports 50, 51, 500 and 4500.
 I have created on both the sonicwall and the cradlepoint, a VTI and triple checked all of the configuration for Phase 1 and Phase 2 to ensure it matches.
 On the Sonicwall, I can see traffic coming from the CP on it&#x27;s public IP on the allowed ports and the reverse leaving the firewall.
 I do not have an Azure VPN Gateway set up - I wanted to set this up without it if it&#x27;s possible due to some limitations with it.
 I&#x27;m quite green with Azure so I&#x27;m trying my best to get something basic working but having difficulties. If you need further information, please let me know.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to data center networking. In my new project we are currently building DC with SDN solution that has both Cisco ACI and also NSX. Can someone please explain why do we need NSX if ACI provides both underlay and overlay networks. I understand that NSX has distributed FW and other features but what else does it solve when you already have ACI that provides L2 extension. Why do we need double overlays?

                              <span>We (a mid-sized ISP) have moved to Nokia 7750 as an edge router. Everything is working great, but until we get our second edge set up, we need to have 2 Google BGP peers on the one router. If I turn them both on, I get asynchronous routing and it causes all kinds of problems. How can I have one set up as a secondary, that only takes accepts prefixes if the main peer goes down? I didn&#x27;t see any kind of option like in the Nokia CLI. I&#x27;m used to Ericsson routers, and they have a multiple-peers with same AS option. TIA!

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;ve noticed that large public Wi-Fi networks tend to have an IP configuration similar to this:
 Network: aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/30 (I&#x27;ve seen segments from 28 to 30)
 Gateway: aaa.bbb.ccc.1 (default gateway is in any IP from segment 23)
 I just wanted to ask if anyone of you have deployed large campus wi-fi networks and know why this is the case. I have some theories of my own:
  
Helps with client isolation.
 Helps with bandwidth management, where you assign certain bandwidth capacity to each subnet.
 ??? (I just don&#x27;t know what else could be the cause of this).

                              <span>Haven&#x27;t touched Comware7 switches much, but the few times I did I would struggle to get Radius working for authentication via NPS. There&#x27;s a few articles out there but somehow I still always had issues like NPS sending Access-Accept, switch logs showing successful login, but it would immediately disconnect me.
 This time I decided to document what I learned so that others might benefit.. i.e me in a few years when I forget again :)
 Switch config:
 ssh server enable radius scheme NPS primary authentication 1.2.3.4 primary accounting 1.2.3.4 key authentication simple MY-PSK-HERE key accounting simple MY-PSK-HERE user-name-format without-domain domain MYDOMAIN authentication login radius-scheme NPS local authorization login radius-scheme NPS local accounting login radius-scheme NPS local domain default enable MYDOMAIN line vty 0 63 authentication-mode scheme user-role network-admin user-role network-operator protocol inbound ssh idle-timeout 600 0 
 NPS
 --Network Policies ----Constraints ------Authentication Methods Uncheck all except for PAP. PAP required. ----Settings ------Vendor Specific Add an attribute &quot;Cisco-AV-Pair&quot; Add attribute value and enter &quot; shell:roles&#x3D;network-admin &quot; 
 Obviously this is not a complete guide. This assumes you know how to set up NPS/radius generally. This is just the hang ups.

 ​
 Problem is I never worked with Catalysts before, and only OS upgrade I&#x27;ve done (1-2 year ago) were on Nexus. I dont really work on anything else apart from ACI nowadays :C
 ​
 Can someone get me through the commands?I guess I&#x27;ll have to transfer the new image file to the switch via tftp, and thats it. I don&#x27;t know anything about boot load orders, confregs, or any of that.
 ​
 Plz help!

 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi,
 thinking about source address persistence in BigIP, but couln&#x27;t find any limits/recomendation.
 The question is, if the timeout in source address persistence profile is set relatively high (for example 8 hours ) how crticial can this become regarding to memory of the BigIP.
 If there are for example 1M entries (for 1M different source IPs) in the persistent table, does this effect perfomance ?
 Already tried &#x27;tmsh show sys memory | grep -i &quot;subsystem\|persist&quot;&#x27; but thats not realy helpful.

                              <span>As my title states. When you have a HA Firewall set to Active-Passive, the passive firewall only comes online in the event of a failure of some sort, even if the active firewall is running at full capacity. Meaning one should configure for Active-Active if you want to achieve load balancing capabilities and reduce latency during high levels of utilization, is my understanding correct?

                              <span>Can I use the Sophos XGS 87 for 35-40 users (actual users might be around 30 only but I am increasing the number futurewise) all the users are basically light internet users (2 users heavily focused on downloading backups from servers which needs bandwith) I have a fiber line of 100Mbps.
 My question was basically that does the firewall software limit users to 20 or is it unlimited but the company advertises it as 20 for declared performance? ( even if performance drops with more users it would not affect my 100Mbps right??)

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am having bandwidth issues and after many tests I am now clueless so I&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ll come up with fresh ideas...
 So here&#x27;s the main issue : using the VPN from home, we have a download speed of 1.5MB/s which is low given the VPN concentrator and infrastructure we have (from the office using the VPN, the download speed is ~30MB/s).
 But this low speed is mainly due to the link/path speed which is low even without using a VPN (8Mo/s). But I can&#x27;t understand why I can only reach 8Mo/s on this link (downloading a file from home to the office WITHOUT VPN).
 What I can&#x27;t explain is that the upload speed from the office to a Cloud Server (mega.nz or weTransfer) uses almost the same path but the upload speed is much better ~20+MB/s (and speedtest.net shows ~500Mbps).
 Here&#x27;s a recap of all the tests I have done so far (no VPN). Know that the speed tests were done with 2 different devices to be sure it&#x27;s not device related (2 file servers, 2 home office computers in different locations, etc..).
 My only guess so far is that it could be due to MTU / packet fragmentation but I don&#x27;t see where would this fragmentation happen. Could they have different policies depending on the flow type (TCP established)? That would explain why Office -&gt; Internet upload speed and Internet -&gt; Office download speed (&#x3D; same flow source / direction) are different but I don&#x27;t see why they would do that?
 Thanks in advance and have a great day!

                              <span>Hi All.
 We&#x27;ve got a BGP with our Plubic AS peering with two Tier 1 providers. (Telia and Cogent)
 The issue I&#x27;m having is that customers using Zayo here in the US are getting latency over 40ms. We&#x27;re based in NYC and our traffic is routed to Atlanta via Zayo, if I use the Zayo looking glass to find our IP, I can confirm it&#x27;s going to Atlanta. Neither of my ISPs can do anything about it.
 I tried reporting Zayo, but no luck. When I ping my office using Altice, the time is fine, but if I ping a Zayo customer or vice versa, it&#x27;s not. Both providers give me the default route.
 Do you guys have any ideas on what to do?

                              <span>Okay im trying to downgrade the firmware on my 7841 cisco ip phones. All I have to work with is a laptop and single router, a pacstar 447 and no Internet. I copied the firmware from a USB to the routers flash, I then configured dhcp. Cme and sip, a voice vlan and interfaces. I configured the port the phone is connecting to as a trunk because it wasn&#x27;t letting me ping the phone unless I did so. When I look in the phones settings it shows it has an ip given from the dhcp I set up, it shows the tftp server ip that I set on the router and it shows the routers domain name and hostname, and the routers ip, it shows that there is no codec on the phone and in the status when I reboot or factory reset the phone it shows dns no ip, so I tried configuring that but it still doesn&#x27;t show up. And when I do the upgrade command or create profile command is says error deleted flash:/ then some weird file name that doesn&#x27;t exist on the router. My supervisor said not to worry about it. Any ideas of what I could be missing? Also before I made it a trunk port the phone would say tftp timed out but now it has the dns thing which confuses me because we&#x27;re not trying to pull anything from a dns and we have all it needs on the router.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been a Barracuda Backup shop for years now. Regulations require holding onto stuff for a long time, and as I inherited it, and it was working, I left it alone. I started down the Veeam Backup path about 3 years ago as a more rich feature set, as well as a secondary backup system. Just got my Barracuda renewal quote and its a 200% rate increase. Its seriously making me consider that its time to throw in the towel and walk away. Anyone have experience trying to get legacy info out of Barracudas and imported into Veeam? Only idea I have at the minute is to restore the yearlies as a VM, then have Veeam back that up. Just take a point in time from every year. Thanks in advance.

 Going to this site shows a cert issue and you&#x27;re quickly re-directed. Seems like an MS Issue, but I can&#x27;t confirm obviously.

 How on earth do you find the time to keep it meaningful? You&#x27;d have to come awful close to an exact clone of production and keep it separate yet synchronized. That strikes me as being a full time job for not just one guy but a team of guys.
 I&#x27;d love to hear what you folks are doing.

                              <span>I apologize that this isn&#x27;t necessarily the right sub but wondering if anyone in here can recommend me a quiet mouse.
 Short story is we have what I like to call a rage clicker - the user is fine but he punishes his mouse to the point people sitting near him complain - more than once lol. I&#x27;m after something that is reasonably quiet compared to your bog standard HP mouse that can also withstand button smashing...
 There are a few on the market but I need to know whatever we get will hold up :/

                              <span>Hi all.
 I’ve been tasked with the seemingly impossible job of trying to figure out how to make the Unitrends backup system meet the needs of our company. 
 In the 3 years we’ve been with Unitrends our situation has gone from bad to worse to where I’m spending majority of my day chasing backups and monitoring ‘round the clock because I can’t take my eyes off the system least I want to spend the next day or two rebooting appliances, stopping/starting tasker, re-syncing assets, etc.
 It’s like pulling teeth trying to get my tickets escalated. They’re putting most of their KB’s behind a pay wall! 
 I’m at my wits end trying to make lemonade out of this lemon. I’m working on picking up bash scripting, but are there any tips, tricks, custom hacks or resources that anyone can recommend for a multi- UB virtual appliance system? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Background:
 So for some brief background I&#x27;m a Jr SysAdmin who has been working for a contractor for a little over half a year now. We manage the entire infrastructure for our client who has a little over a handful of buildings across multiple sites totaling a few hundred rotating users plus about 1500 devices. We use sys asmin very loosely so I was actually originally intended to do help desk.
 Somehow I&#x27;ve somehow found my way to working with firewalls, certs, GPOs, Endpoint-Management, Patching, as well as managing our ePO.
  
The situation:
 Now when I say working on the firewall, I mean teaching our new network engineer how our firewall works as he had never interacted with it (our former left). I don&#x27;t have the permissions to touch it myself, however I was asked to start managing our certs (some internal, and externals) which would have come with said permissions. I was also set up to manage a site by myself, this being on top of my usual tasks I have been working on.
 Keep in mind I am the only &quot;jr.&quot; and make the least money in our team of almost 20 despite me being one of the only 5-ish admins who work at the enterprise level. So with this, I decided to decide to come back and tell them I would be happy to do these things under the condition that they actually pay me more (I make 60, asked for 75).
 This request was then greeted with a sudden lack of interest as well as an email to colleagues behind my back to find out everything I am involved in and/or have been handed. Additionally asking them to stop laying as much work on me.
  
The question:
 I have not received any response in an official capacity yet, but I have a bad feeling. Do you guys think it&#x27;s time to start applying, or do you think it may go well?
 Thank you guys :)

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 Currently going through an M365 migration (E3). I have a number of third party applications that I like (Sentinelone, Splunk, Okta etc.), but there is a number of comparable applications that seem to integrate nicely together. 
 Generally speaking, I&#x27;m against putting all my eggs in one basket but I was curious if anyone has pulled the trigger and moved to 100% (or close to) 365/Azure/Sentinel setup and what your experience has been.
 Thanks!

                              <span>EDIT: here is my first post.
 After 24 h Update: The situation has escalated since my last post. One of my managers DMed me and asked me not to do the task that I messed up yesterday until we are together, we had this conversation:
  
Manager: *Hi [my name]. (he never did that)* 
 Me: Hi. 
 Manager: Are you doing well? (He never did that before and I thought I was about to get fired, so his sudden niceness was surprising.&quot; ) 
 Me: Yes, I&#x27;m doing well. 
 Manager: Please don&#x27;t do the task (that I messed up yesterday) until we are together. 
 Me: Okay, I&#x27;ll wait for you. (Big thank god on my face)
  
I ended up doing the task anyway and he handled the communication of the task with the client, they are taking extra precautions to avoid any further damage.

 Unfortunately, they were never told to rename it.
 Who else has stumbled the hard way on Microsoft&#x27;s limit of 256 characters in a file name? Are there any tools for those files these days other than robocopy-ing them to a shorter path?

                              <span>I was pinged around 11:30 am yesterday by someone asking if I could setup an app deployment for that day to ~50 devices. I said sure, just get me the info (computer names, timeframe). They said sure.
 Radio silence for over 2 hours.
 &quot;I&#x27;m just finishing up the list, I should have it over to you any minute now.&quot;
 Around 4pm I get on another call with a co-worker talking about some weirdness with my Azure portal login. We&#x27;re on the phone until nearly 5pm, and by this time I completely forgot about the deployment, because I never saw anything come over. So I log off for the day.
 I&#x27;m on PTO today, and I get pinged about that deployment from my manager, on behalf of the guy who requested the deployment. Apparently they sent me the info after 4:30pm, and my bosses response after I told him that was &quot;4:30 is still within core hours&quot;.

                              <span>This is the first time in my career that this has ever happened, from my days as a grunt, all the way up to team leadership. I have never struggled so hard to find a job.
 I’ve thoughtfully applied for over 100 jobs in the last few weeks, asking within their own posted salary ranges and never at the high end. I’ve provided cover letters, did research on the companies, the works.
 I want to work, and no matter what effort I put, no matter how I tune my Resume, I have not landed even a single interview. I’ve done everything short of getting on my knees for it, but nobody is hiring. I’m this close to just quitting the industry and joining a trade.
 How the hell are you folks surviving in this market, if you don’t already have a job?!

Well, it looks like it came faster than many of us were expecting. I&#x27;m not sure how I missed this until today, but there&#x27;s an update from Microsoft announcing the availability to manage Windows LAPS via Intune and store passwords in Azure AD (posted 4/21):

                              <span>Throwaway here. So, Security professional for a medium sized org (4k+ employees). Got a hit on a suspicious email over the weekend and since I&#x27;m on call I decided to take a look. What that email contained was a Powerpoint presentation and a large Excel file with several macros from an outside consulting company that we have hired. Basically, it details a large push to outsource almost all of our business processes by 2026. This includes all of IT. The plan is that we will cut down to less than 1200 employees.
 So, couple of questions. Those have went through an outsourcing before, is it customary for the employees being laid off to be asked to help in the transition? Only scenario I can see that being appealing if I was only a few years from retirement. Is there any other incentive for me to stick around?
 Besides updating my resume, anything else I should do?

 I was hoping some of you fine folks have some ideas/recommendations for a tool that would monitor software that is used within our environment that can track updates that are needed.
 Sorry, bit of a word salad there. Basically, as I&#x27;m sure a lot of you can relate to, we have software that will be two or three versions out of date but aren&#x27;t aware of it due to the time that would be needed to check each and every piece of software individually. I&#x27;m not even sure if something like this exists, honestly.
 Any help/input would be greatly appreciated.
 Have a good day!

 Today I come to work and see that all the displays have a “This device does not have an active subscription license…” message. Going out to the website, I’m not seeing any reference to the free offering any more. 
 I went through my emails to see if I had been given any heads up that the licensing was going to change, but I’m not seeing anything. Has anyone else been caught off guard with this, or was there plenty of warning and my spam filters possibly prevented me from knowing this was coming?

                              <span>So ive been noticing the amount of rants going up lately and people being burned out. STOP. Its not your company. you just work for them. do the workload you can do to the best of your abilities, and then go home when its time. stop taking those stupid meetings and stop staying late. when people push things onto you, put them at the end of the queue and go about your day. if you cant feasibly do a project in 10 days when you know its gonna take a month, say so. dont just roll over and take it. stand up for yourselves. you wont get that promotion for doing more work, and you wont lose your job for doing less work. shits on fire? cool. not your company. you are just there for a paycheck. nothing more.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have two iR-ADV C5740 copiers.
 Recently they were moved to a new building, and now they are having issues with what seems like waking up from a deep sleep. When prints are sent, it&#x27;s taking a few minutes for it to wake up and print. No settings were changed. It&#x27;s on a 2 hour sleep timer, which is the longest you can set, and within that time frame it will go back into this deep sleep. It&#x27;s definitely losing network connection during this sleep, which is why prints are getting stuck in a queue till a point in which it wakes back up. I&#x27;ve found this out when attempting to ping it when reports come in that prints aren&#x27;t going through.
 Has anyone ran into something like this? I&#x27;m leaning more towards an issue with the network or switch than a sleep or energy saving setting, because like I said, nothing was changed.

                              <span>Years ago, when I handled my first tickets it was baffling to me why people would not want their tickets resolved. 
 I came to the conclusion that there are two types of people that open tickets, people that want their issue resolved, people that want their issue documented and possibly resolved in the future. The second type of effectively uses tickets as a technology to do list. .
 Now, years later, in every job, for every team, every time I go through aging tickets, I identify that trend early on. Sometimes it&#x27;s impossible to stop people from using the ticket queue as their personal to-do list but awareness is the first step to mitigating this issue.

 It would cost us $25K/year.....to control updates....for their own product. Am I missing something here? Is this not insane to anyone else? I hate WSUS as much as the next guy but damn.

But they marked the meeting URGENT and the meeting organizer sends you a dozens Teams messages because you haven&#x27;t joined the call yet.

                              <span>Hello everyone, i would like some assistance to resolve the problem.
 I have one Jabra Pro 925 Mono headset, did not get it with a dongle when it was ordered.
 The issue is, one of my friends accidently stopped the firmware update on the headset, it was supposed to update to 1.8.2
 Now my headset is constantly glowing with purple color and is stuck updating,(firmvare version 0.0.1) in the aplication Jabra Direct i have the option to recover but there is the catch... So whenever i press the button it goes in starting update mode and goes for hours and never finishes.
 I saw in an old post that there should be a folder in the application:
 C:\Program Files (x86)\Jabra\SDKFirmwareUpdater
 But i do not have this file type (SDKFirmwareUpdater)
 I am using the latest Jabra direct.
 Please help and thank you, for all additional info i will provide

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I was configuring a new user on Windows 11 and trying to remove onedrive libraries for the Documents folder and also set it to a custom folder. Unfortunately I answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the prompt that gave the following warning
 &quot;Do you want to redirection folder &#x27;Documents&#x27; into another system folder &#x27;Profile&#x27; located at C:\Users\username&quot;? If you proceed with the redirection you will not be able to separate them or restore default location.&quot;
 I&#x27;ve since corrected some registry settings and actually do have the Documents library folder where I want it, however in explorer whenever I view the &quot;C:\Users&quot; folder, instead of showing &quot;username&quot; for the user profile it is showing &quot;Documents&quot; in place of their name. (If you click on the path in the path bar it actually shows the correct username, but whenever it shows folder names anywhere it reverts to showing &quot;Documents&quot;).
 I can&#x27;t seem to find what might be causing this or where it would be set. Is it possible to correct this?
 Everything seems to be working fine, it&#x27;s just showing &quot;Documents&quot; in place of &quot;username&quot; in the C:\Users folder which is bothering me.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Come across a weird issue this morning where shortcuts in a network drive location pointing to a different folder on the same server but a different share fail to work when a user is trying to &quot;Save As&quot; 
 Shortcut target is the local path name and works fine when using explorer but fails within the &quot;Save As&quot; dialogue of any program (Office, Notepad, ETC)
 Obviously I can work around this by updating the shortcuts to the hostname/share path but found it weird that it works fine within Explorer. There is also a lot of shortcuts to locations due to the way the business has created its workflow.
 Last update to workstations was 17/04 and we believe its been fine since the update. 
 Im sure this used to work with no issues and there&#x27;s been no major changes as far as I know. Couldn&#x27;t be a DNS thing could it? Looking at it I find it weird that it even works in the first place and is still working in explorer considering the target path is D:\ rather than \\hostname

                              <span>For those who have worked in more sizable environments using centralized DHCP... How has this worked out for you? How many scopes were &quot;manageable&quot; on you DHCP servers? We are looking at a design that will require about 650 additional scopes to be added to our DHCP servers. Does this sound rediculous? It sounds a bit much to me (not that we would have so many subnets nationwide... just that we would have that all on a central DHCP server)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Admins, I would like to ask regarding Windows Malicious Software removal tool. My server has a McAfee Antivirus, recently there is MRT vulnerability detected on my server, and it is showing that the version is not updated, which I need to upgrade the version in order to remediate the vulnerability. Is it okay to have Windows Malicious Software removal tool running on my server even though I have McAfee Antivirus? Or is it better to disable (if possible) the malicious removal tool? Additionally will it affect my applications running on the server? Your replies are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a situation where I&#x27;m working for an IT broker, mainly just doing some really basic testing on second hand components. Even though it involves servers and other enterprise equipment, I don&#x27;t really know anything about setting them up. I&#x27;m slowly getting further and further into debt because it doesn&#x27;t pay well, and I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;ll ever progress past the point I&#x27;m at now because this is literally all the company does. I&#x27;m at a total dead end. It&#x27;s really impacting me mentally and I&#x27;m legitimately getting worried that one day I&#x27;ll just decide to give up on everything.
 I&#x27;ve tried applying to a couple of IT support and SysAdmin jobs locally but it&#x27;s clear that I don&#x27;t have the skills they&#x27;re looking for. I have no skills in anything else either, no degree or anything like that. All I can really do is self-teach if I ever get the motivation to do so. But it seems that everything I look at seems to be giving me different answers. I just want to know, from some people in the industry, what sorts of things should I be looking at when gaining the skills for a SysAdmin job? What software, languages etc should I be learning to use? Any way to learn them for free or as cheap as possible? I can&#x27;t afford any kind of certification like CCNA or CompTIA, so is it worth making a portfolio? How would I do that?
 Basically just any advice would be much appreciated. I&#x27;m so lost and overwhelmed right now.

                              <span>Oh man I hate S Mode. 
 So I installed Windows 10 on a new laptop. Despite me not wanting S mode, it&#x27;s on automatically. Fine I&#x27;ll just remove it.
 But wait, the WLAN drivers are missing, so I can&#x27;t get onto the internet to disable it in the store. Fine I&#x27;ll just install the drivers.
 Oh no, you can&#x27;t run .exe files in S Mode... So I need to get online to disable S mode but I can&#x27;t get online with S mode active... Fine I&#x27;ll just disable S mode in regedit.
 Oh no, not even regedit will load in S Mode. So now I&#x27;m stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
 Trying regedit in recovery mode shows me the SkuPolicyRequired value as already set to 0 so that&#x27;s no help either.
 a) any ideas?
 b) why is S mode a thing?!

                              <span>Hi r/Sysadmin,
 We&#x27;re currently installing a few hundred Verkada cameras but needing a Windows 3rd party IP camera viewer solution since they now support RSTP streaming. Mainly to have lower latency surveillance but also to ease up access rights management via Verkada command.
 Has anyone got any recommendations for a fit for production solution that has manageability, allows profiles / configs and can span across multiple screens? A lot of the stuff I&#x27;ve found so far has been suitable for homelab and small integrations but not on a bigger scale.
 Thanks all

 They are also reporting 500 errors when accessing Outlook online with the &quot;more information&quot; giving a Microsoft Exchange Data Storage MailboxCrossSiteFailoverException error
 It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a network issue as other users on the same sites are connecting fine, and as far as I know the mobile apps are working fine.
 MS service status isn&#x27;t showing anything either 
 Anyone else seeing this or are we just that bit more special?
 EDIT: MS service health page is showing impact to Outlook desktop and Web clients as part of their fix to a search issue from yesterday. Looks like this is our problem

 I can open MS Teams and it’s working no problem.
 I open a browser and try to google, and it doesn’t load. I tried amazon and that doesnt work either. 
 I then tried our company intranet. That also doesnt load!
 Any ideas, please?
 Thank you.

 I need to run a specific script during the Task sequence. But i want this script to run as the very last step. The Task sequence needs to be &quot;completed&quot; and logged in as the local admin. After the first logon, i want to script to run.
 Where should i place the Powershell script in my Task sequence? I&#x27;ve now added it to custom tasks, but it&#x27;s not working.

                              <span>Hey all, long time lurker, occasional poster here. This is a message to any lurkers who think just cause your young doesn’t mean you can’t seize the opportunity.
 As I’ve just landed a placement working as a junior cybersecurity analyst as apart of my college course. Admittedly, I have past experience in the field (home projects/CTFs).
 Please, if your thinking of a career in IT, go for it. Someone out there will take you, I’ve had to contact every company in my local city and towns around it and got this one and others are now offering. If you don’t take initiative, how can you know what you can do?
 For those wondering, I’m mainly going to be shadowing and assisting with governance, vulnerability scanning and occasional SOC work.
 My next steps, learn. Learn. Learn. Having no certifications means I have a lot to learn ;).

 We are a company with 10 users who access remotely to our customers servers (one or two per customer).
 Currently, we use Teamviewer because all of our customers use it for host remote because it&#x27;s free.
 However, our corporate license will cost 330$/month. It&#x27;s too expensive...
 Do you know an alternative of remote app for our team ?
 We want each user can connect on a server simultanously without limit and install a free host for our customer.

 I imagine that together with my colleagues we would do something like &quot;books&quot;, something like wiki pages.
 What do you suggest or already use?

 Im using the script below to get the model of the computer and then run a batch file from a DVD_ROM drive located at a specific path.
 However with $path i get &quot;D\&quot; but it needs to be &quot;D:\&quot;.
 Anyone who can help me to fix the script to add the &quot;:&quot; to the driveletter?

                              <span>Hello all, I am trying to setup a Windows 10 Multi App Kiosk with some camera software (Hikvision iVMS-4200 Desktop client) which requires admin privileges. Please note this a staff facing kiosk not a public facing kiosk.
 Following this tutorial (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps). I have managed to set up my Kiosk on a Standard Windows Account. With a seperate Admin Account to manage the PC. In the kiosk when I click on the application it triggers the &quot;User Account Control&quot; (UAC) pop up asking for the admin password. 
 I have tried the following to bypass this:
  
Changing UAC settings in Control Panel to have not notify. This works for the standard account when not in Kiosk Mode. But when I apply the kiosk provisioning package it seems to turn UAC back on. 
 Changing the compatibility settings to &quot;Run as Admin&quot; for the exe.
 Following (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_compatibility_view.html) from Reddit Question (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/khda06/windows_10_kiosk_mode_running_an_app_with/) I have tried to change this to &quot;Run as Invoker&quot;. 
 Changing the permissions of the folder in which the exe lives in to give standard accounts full permission over that folder.
  
All of these &quot;fixes&quot; work when the kiosk account normally but stops working when I apply the kiosk mode.
 This would make sense as the single app kiosk docs say that UAC need to be enabled for it to work (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/kiosk-single-app). I presume this is the same for multi app kiosk mode.
 Essentially is there any way that I can get an application requiring admin privileges running inside a kiosk without
 Or is there another work around. Something like are we able to create an admin account that could use its password to pass the UAC but does not have a &quot;Desktop Login&quot;. Then I can just share that password. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Long story short, I want to run one of my carts solely off of a battery system we use on set that has 26v and 48v outputs. My switches that I use in my network have 53.5v inputs. Wondering if anyone has a recommendation for boosting the voltage, there are plenty of boosters available online that you can DIY but in my experience any boost or buck I’ve bought can rarely handle any sort of load and I’m not looking at a lot of draw but don’t want to be caught with my pants down if I have to pull some POE+ to the max. Thanks to anyone with insight, I’ll be checking a few other electronics based subreddits as well

                              <span>Greetings everyone,
 A bit stumped on this one, as I&#x27;ve never seen this before. During this TCP handshake between a client and server, I noticed the client sends a [FIN, ACK] on step 3. Any ideas what could be happening here? Has anyone else encountered this?
 For context, I&#x27;m basically trying to send Netflow from a load balancer to a NetFlow collector. The firewall is not blocking this connection, but shows the app as &#x27;incomplete&#x27;.
 Here&#x27;s what I found:
 client: syn server: syn, ack client: fin, ack &lt;---- ? server: ack server: fin, ack client: ack 
 Edit: formatting

                              <span>We&#x27;re still looking for the right brand for our upcoming K12 school site project (600 students, 100 staff, 230 chromebooks, 100 computers). Right now we&#x27;re running a smaller Ubiquiti setup (12 switches and 20 Aps, since 2106) without a single failure, but we wanted to step up to a more professional grade brand, investigating Juniper, Ruckus, Forti and Huawei, however the first quotations are expensive, compared to our budget. 
 We need: 
  
24 ports switches: 6 units
 48 ports switches: 15 units
 Eventually 12 aggregation switches (in case there&#x27;s no stacking option, such as for Ubiquiti)
 78 Wifi 6e APs
  
We have received a Netgear offer, but honestly, at that level I&#x27;d rather stay with Ubiquiti. 
 Just wondering if there is any other brand, which deserves to be mentioned, standing in between the top brands and the lower ones (Ubiquiti &amp; Netgear)

Currently, if the device&#x27;s MAC that&#x27;s trying to join isn&#x27;t in Active Directory and assigned to a VLAN with NPS, it gets rejected from joining the network.

                              <span>Hi!
 I want to reorganize my network rack and will need some patch cables. I came across cables from FS.com and I love their snagless plugs and the fact they can be ordered in different lengths and colors but those patch cables are too stiff for my liking. They offer the thin cables but I have mixed feelings about those, especially for PoE patches. Can anyone recommend other brands of Cat6 patch cables that can be ordered in custom lengths and colors with snagless plugs at least as good as the FS ones? I think I would also be fine with Cat5e as I rock a 1 Gbps network.

                              <span>I have a need for routing protocol between two routers, however there is a firewall between them. I can establish an iBGP peering between the two routers and they exchange routes successfully. However, the firewall itself is unaware of that routing table and therefore does not know how to route to networks beyond the directly connected. While I can also peer iBGP with the firewall I would prefer not to. How can I set up an iBGP peering without also having the firewall participate in BGP?
 I think I would need some other IGP such as OSPF between the routers and the firewall with redistribution from BGP to OSPF in order to make this work. Does that make sense? It seems like a good compromise.
 ​
 TL;DR: How to peer BGP between two routers without having to peer BGP with the firewall between them?

                              <span>So it’s my first foray into MPO and I got stuck.
 I bought an MPO Type A cable and two Type A MPO-to-12xLC cassettes off FS.
 I know these should be straight 1-1 connected (port 1 &#x3D; port 1, port 2 &#x3D; port 2, etc) so using the regular cross polarised LC-LC patch lead at both ends results in the wrong polarity. So I switched around the LC plugs on one end of one of the LC patch cables but the link is still not coming up.
 I tried different ports and even a totally different set of MPO cable and cassettes.
 Using a simple LC-LC patch cable, eliminating the entire MPO/cassette path between the two end devices works fine.
 It’s all singlemode so I cannot “see the light” to figure out what’s going on, and I don’t have any fiber testing tools.
 What am I missing?

                              <span>We apply it towards the upstream peers. Do you also apply it towards customer connections? Devices connected to customers don’t have global routing table. RPF has some options for default-route. But, just wondering if ISPs actually apply it on customer connections or not.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Currently a helpdesk tech looking to learn more about networks to eventually move to a networks admin role.
 Just wanted to ask for a little help. I have been tasked with moving a switch over to a new site.
 I have the switch with me and have been given the new ip address and hostname i need to assign to the box.
 My question is how would I hook up the device so it&#x27;s discoverable on the network?
 I assume I would have to physically connect one of the ports on the switch to the other stack of switches already there?
 After i do this i assume i just console onto the switch and change the hostname and IP.
 Thanks in advance for the help

                              <span>I&#x27;ve successfully installed PFSense and working fine. This was a response to Nokia gpon modem router crashing but unfortunately the problem continues. 
 PROBLEM ISP supplied Nokia Gpon ont modem router crashes within 24 or Max 48 hours. Replaced Nokia 3 times and works fine for a month and then starts crashing every 24 hours ISP doesn&#x27;t offer bridge mode 
 SETUP -Nokia GPON ont modem router with 100Mbps -VLAN trunnked to a Cisco switch and then -Connected to pfsense double NAT (ISP doesn&#x27;t offer bridge) -Connected to Cisco wlan controller and APs Avg clients connected 200 - pfsense CPU usage at 2% and RAM at 24% temp normal - standard firewall rules except blocked ipv6 broadcasts -rfc1918 disabled on lan and wan -dns resolver and forwarder setup (was having issue with iphones not dnsing, now solved) - daily avg traffic up and down is 500GB - no captive portal - no dual wan - LAN subnet is 192.168.31.0/22 -pfsense wan IP is 192.168.1.2 -ISP modem router lan IP 192.168.1.1 - obviously public IP on isp router 
 This is what I have tried so far 
  
limit sessions to max 20k -session expiry 5 hours (default was 24 hours and sessions were reaching 20K) 
 traffic shaper using limiters limits speed to 20Mbps up and down
 DHCP expiry 6 hours (majority of clients change every 24 hours)
 nftop monitoring (found torrents and blocked)
  
Temp solution is to restart the Nokia and everything works fine. 
 What am I missing here? There is no way to bridge the modem and no other isp serves this area. 
 What is crashing the NoKia gpon ont modem router? 
 How can I use pfsense to detect the issue and solve it?

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I&#x27;ve got a customer who is moving from a flat network into an ACI/SDA, and want to move their various BMS devices in with them. First thing to move in will be the door access.
 Does anyone have much experience of this? As the door access are all on a flat subnet, they work nicely, then I move them into the SDA, do I need to run an L2 transit specifically for their own VN, or is IP Directed Broadcast where I need to be looking?
 The longer term plan is to move the BMS server into the ACI from the current LAN - as a further question, how can that be integrated? I&#x27;m siding with L2 transit..
 Best, CC

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am in search of media converters I can use at the end user ports. Some of the areas under my control are highly secure, so fiber switches are installed with a bunch of end devices that have no fiber ports, only copper.
 I hate media converters, but have ran into many issues; 1. lack of PoE, 2. not passing client disconnect messages, and 3. not passing EAPoL messages (specifically media converter switch issue).
 Has anyone else here experienced similar issues with their media converters, mainly #2 and #3? Do you have any you would recommend?

I am new to EtherCAT, and I need help setting up the communication devices between a Kollmorgen AKD motor driver and a conventional window system using an EtherCAT card. Can you recommend an EtherCAT card that is user-friendly for beginners? I am considering the Advantech PCI-1203 or the Hilscher CIFX-50E-RE. Which one would you suggest?

 Have anyone done some automation around prefix-sets and updating them from a system like Ansible?
 We would like to update a prefix-set based on ddos protection.
 But it seems no one has done prefix-set updating?

                              <span>I recently landed a gig consulting for about $150/hr. Contract is 6 months, but this is government work so it could probably last a year or more.
 Post COVID, with the advent of much more remote work, I&#x27;ve begun exploring taking several lower level positions that are 100% remote to help me reach my financial retirement goals sooner. 
 I feel like my salary is atypical. A 300k job for an engineer is quite rare in my opinion, but on /r/sales it seemed to be suggested that this was quite normal, with people going up to 500-700k and beyond for exceptional performers. 
 Now, working multiple lower end jobs, I can see myself comfortably achieving 300~500k (2-3 jobs). I basically just see myself as my own consulting business, taking on multiple clients who renting my time. Whether they use it or not is up to them. 
 I&#x27;m just hoping to get an engineer&#x27;s take on how much of what is said on /r/sales about those salaries is chest thumping versus reality. Are 250k-300k sales jobs typical? I know SEs that get 220~240 for OTE. 
 I feel like you could be a great salesman, get a shitty account list at the wrong time (for example competing vendor wins project) and then be left with a dry patch and fail to make your number. Idk, it seems like it&#x27;s not always under your control.

                              <span>Hey guys.
 If you have a router in front of your firewall and a small IP block from your ISP do you generally set up a transit VLAN between the router/firewall using your public space and NAT on the firewall or run RFC1918 space between them and NAT at the router? 
 I feel like it would be more beneficial to dPAT at the edge and static NAT whatever on the inside needs to be accessible but I see a lot of people deploying public IP space on the transit VLAN between router/fw and NAT on the FW.

                              <span>This is a dumb question. I recently started dealing with an MPLS network. I have minimal experience here. I am looking at a topology map for this network and see no public IP addresses at the branch offices. I wonder if this was not added by mistake or if I misunderstood something. 
 I guess my question here is if you are using MPLS does each branch location get its own public ip address for the internet? or is everything routed to the primary office then sent out to the internet? 
 If anyone has any material on this, I would really appreciate it.

                              <span>In our area, when company subscribed to leased line , they are provided with big bulky equipment with brand names like nokia, cisco etc.
 Recently, the company subscribe to a leased line (different ISP in our area). And they just provide a small, made of plastic huawei ONU modem. 
 Is this normal nowadays? Although the speed is faster but it feel not the same performance in the old bulky equipment on our old leased line ISP.

                              <span>Does anyone know what would work for connecting Aruba to Fortigate? 
 We tried a FS.com 100gb qsfp breakout DAC on the Aruba to 25gb sfp on the fortigate but it&#x27;s not recognizing anything on the Aruba side. Fortigate can see the transceiver but says unsupported. Aruba acts like nothing exists and unsupported transceivers have been enabled. 
 Aruba says it needs to be an Aruba transceiver. Fortigate says it needs fortigate. Go figure... 
 DAC would be ideal since it&#x27;s a very short run but if anyone knows of optics that would work, that&#x27;s fine too. Trying not to break the bank with 20k transceivers here. Don&#x27;t want to keep buying things that &quot;might&quot; work. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am dealing with a PoE security camera that is being installed in a secondary building on site. This site is not wired but can easily connect to the wifi network from the main building. I am looking for a WiFi Bridge that I can connect to the WiFi network and then wire into the camera. But I want to avoid adding a PoE injector into this mix as well, so I am trying to find a bridge that also has PoE output.

How can I be sure load balancing is happening? I tried traceroute from multiple devices but it always takes same next hop. As BGP multipath is flow based i tried tcp trace from different ip and different src port still always get same next hop. How can see that loads are shared among next hops?

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone would look at a design I threw together. The goals of this are:
  
The firewalls provide NGFW and NGIPS features between every VLAN and VPN connections to remote sites
 The Nexus switches will be 10Gbps connection for quite a few access switches. Only server and 1 department are depicted in this picture
 Full redundancy
  
My concerns with the design
  
Are the firewalls appropriately placed to provide IPS and FW functions?
 Are the Nexus switches overkill for this topology?
  
Any tips/assistance/comments will be appreciated.

 We ordered three JL675A (Aruba 6100 48 port PoE) from Ingram back in November. They were back ordered at the time, but it&#x27;s now freaking April and there&#x27;s no ETA in sight. 
 Anyone have any insight as to what is going on with Aruba? Is there a better distributor that might have a quicker beat on these?

                              <span>I volunteer for a youth organization that has a camp in BFE. Strangely, BFE has FTTH... Anyway, I co-admin the network spread between the various buildings on the property through fiber. Currently, services just include wireless internet, voip phones, and a couple of hardwired printers. Long range, I&#x27;d love to add some security cameras, but I need to get buy-in from the professional leadership that own/lead the camp. The network is purposefully flat with no vlans for quick repair and troubleshooting if one of the skilled network admins aren&#x27;t on site.
 Historically, we&#x27;ve used older Cisco PoE switches (3750, or thereabouts) purchased off of ebay or the random cast-off from corporate donors along with a Cisco cleanair n-wireless controller and APs for wireless. Generally speaking, we only need 8 PoE ports plus a SFP uplink in 99% of our buildings since other than phones and wireless APs, everything is done over wireless.
 The most common failure mode of our switches are power supply failure, either from old age or occasionally poor power conditions. But, obtaining switches to replace a couple every year has been difficult and adding up. The Cisco 3750s are between $60-100 generally on ebay, but I am wondering if there&#x27;s a better value PoE switch out there that isn&#x27;t so long in the tooth? Yes, I know $100 or less per switch is really a pretty good deal, but when the budget is $0 and you have a very small pool of people willing to donate money or equipment, it gets demoralizing

 Hi, can someone please point me in the right direction here with the API?
 I&#x27;m just trying to do a test and add this IP above!
 But i&#x27;m getting this response back everytime:
 Failed to add address object. Status code: 400 {&#x27;code&#x27;: 3, &#x27;message&#x27;: &#x27;Missing Query Parameter: vsys&#x27;, &#x27;details&#x27;: [{&#x27;@type&#x27;: &#x27;CauseInfo&#x27;, &#x27;causes&#x27;: [{&#x27;code&#x27;: 7, &#x27;module&#x27;: &#x27;panui_restapi&#x27;, &#x27;description&#x27;: &#x27;Missing Query Parameter: vsys&#x27;}]}]} 
 I&#x27;m not use to the PA API and in my web gui i can see vsys1.
 I&#x27;m not really sure where to go to be honest and every resource out there doesn&#x27;t really give you straight answer or any full examples which is mental as well.

                              <span>I am trying to find max lengths for 2.5 and 5Gbps on Cat6a and having a lot of trouble.
 I am assuming it will go further than 100m. Does anybody know max length?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 i am trying to troubleshoot why some OT devices in a big vlan ~281 hosts are not responding to ping after some time.
 We have a Client where every 30min a ftp connection to a ot devices is established. Sometimes we get the notification that the ftp transfer failed. The client is in a seperate vlan.
 I tried to sniff packets from the ftp client and the only thing I see is TCP Retransmissions of the first SYN packet everytime.
 Then I looked at the port where the ftp server is connected and I see that the TCP Syn Packets are arriving there. Also I can ping other devices on the same vlan during this time but I don&#x27;t get SYN ACK packets back from the server.
 I see that the ftp server sends &quot;Who has 192.168.100.254? Tell 192.168.100.250&quot; then the Gateway responds with &quot;192.168.100.254 is at 00:09:0f:09:1c:be&quot;. It is like this over and over until you restart the ot ftp device. The delay between the arp who has tell is 6,9,5,11,27 seconds.
 What could that be? A ping also from the same vlan to the ot ftp device during this time is also not possible.
 EDITED: IT&#x27;s 281 not 1022 active Hosts the Subnet&#x27;s size would be 1022 Hosts but only 281 Hosts are currently connected.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been running Fortinet &amp; Ubiquiti switches and AP&#x27;s for a while, but now we might have a good line on Datto equipment.
 On the one hand, I REALLY like the Fortinet devices because of SPOG management and the NAC-lite features when integrated with FortiGate has been useful in our more secure environments.
 Ubiquiti is just plain affordable for our SMB clients and while it&#x27;s nowhere near as feature rich, the base features are pretty easy enough to use that my techs don&#x27;t need to know ALL the networking stuff to do some basic troubleshooting if they have to. Plus, the flex mini switch is honestly a godsend - a $30 managed/ish POE-powered switch is a fantastic alternative to some random box that gets added when someone needs just one more port.
 Our company uses Kaseya which means we could manage the network from our RMM platform - a potentially huge benefit. But I only know Datto from its software, not as a networking company, so I&#x27;m curious if their hardware actually holds up

                              <span>Hoping someone can make some recommendations here - I&#x27;m looking for an equivalent switch, both in capability and cost, to the EdgeSwitch PoE+ 48 (500W) from Ubiquiti as they&#x27;ve been out of stock for a long time now and I&#x27;m not sure when, if ever, they will be back. 
 I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more if necessary, but these were a great value and the UI/functionality was perfect, especially at this price point.
 Does such a switch exist?

                              <span>We have a few remote sites that are connected via fiber that have Cisco 2960X switches. The sites are on a /30 and at the remote switch we are just using a static route to point everything to headquarters but also have ospf enabled.
 Some sites are small, with just a few users, and a couple sites are larger with access points, cameras, etc.
 If we replace our aging 2960x&#x27;s at remote sites, Meraki has two models we are looking at:
 MS225 (no ospf, but capable of 16 static routes)
 MS250 (ospf, also does static routes)
 Do we &quot;need&quot; to pay extra for the MS250 in this case? Does OSPF matter at the edge if we are only using one strand of fiber?

 I have a legacy ASA with an inside and outside interface. On this ASA we do some NAT, routing etc
 I need to reroute the inside traffic to another device, I remember messing with nameif interfaces can delete parts of config. 
 What is best practise for moving the “nameif” to a new interface without losing parts of config ?

                              <span>Hi all. It came to my mind what if you have like 3-4 vendor certification like Cisco, Aruba, Forti whatever and all associated recertification requirements. I mean after a number of different certifications will you all the time have to start studiing for recertifications or will different certifications work together in such a way that one renewal will also help the other renewal? Are there any examples? For example, does one get extra learning points for CCNP if they have other professional certifications?
 Thanks for all the replies

                              <span>Hello Networkers,
 I have been trying to configure 802.1X with EAP-TLS in a Windows domain for a while now. Using freshly installed Win Server 2022 for DC and PKI, and ClearPass in a Lab environment (was set up after the configuration didn&#x27;t work in the production environment). 
 Certificates for computer and user authentication are distributed cleanly via autoenrollment and authentication on the network works fine - but only after the user GPOs have already been processed and the user is already on the desktop. With this, the GPOs for folder redirects and drive mappings don&#x27;t work because the client can&#x27;t reach the file server without user authentication. Wireshark shows me that the client first tries to get to the file server long before 802.1X user authentication takes place.
 If I disconnect the network connection while logged in and re-establish it, authentication works immediately. 
 Microsoft support has not been able to help us so far and Aruba is not aware of the problem either.
 Do you have any tips?

 I&#x27;m keen to see what solutions people are using out there. We are currently mostly using Ansible to pull the info down, then parse it and display in a custom built tool.

 I also looked into just using USMT, but Microsoft is suggestion using a Win 7 AIK? That seems suspicious.
 ​
 Does anyone have any suggestions on what works nice and cleanly? Preferably for little to no cost?

 I have a situation where I need to find a way to retain BitLocker recovery keys outside of Azure AD/On-prem AD.
 We are trying to use a new auditing system that can recover deleted AD/Azure devices but not the recovery key leaf. Are there any products or means to pull those keys from AD and securely retain them outside of those systems?
 I&#x27;ve looked around but no products have really stood out as a stand-alone option for this situation.
 Thanks in advance!

 It does show up if I create a meeting within TEAMS app itself but not in outlook. I tried disabling/enabling the addin with no affect so far.
 Going to the user in Teams Admin, I see Audio Conferencing is ENABLEd as well so I am not sure why outlook not giving the audio link. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey guys. I’m knees deep in a cloning project for 17 laptops using Clonezilla and I’m wondering why you would use Sysprep in audit mode. 
 In my case- all my laptops that are getting imaged are all the same model. 
 After I’m done building my reference image, I plan on Sysprepping with /oobe/generalize and shutdown options. (I’ll also make sure I delete the user I’ve been using to install everything and create a new “offline account” to run sysprep so as not to trigger the Windows Store from interfering with Sysprep. Before reboot I’ll clone. 
 Let’s say after I sysprep, I realize I forgot a piece of software, or want to tweak a setting. 
 Wouldn’t it be just as easy to boot into the oobe, make any changes and sysprep again rather than going into Audit mode? You can sysprep the same image 1001 times now. Perhaps Audit mode was a better option when sysprep was limited to 3 times?
 Looking for an easy explanation of why/when to use Audit mode in sysprep. 
 Thanks guys!
 Edit to ask another question:
 Can you unbox a new laptop with an OEM image of Windows 10 , customize then sysprep it? Or do you need to install a Volume Lic version of your own on the new laptop? I have a MAK license.

Root access disabled via SSH
 Limited user provisioned
 Only able to access the machine with an SSH key
 fail2ban enabled
 UFW firewall only exposing the necessary ports
  
How well would you assess the security based on the above?
 Is there anything else I should do to have give myself peace of mind the boxes will stay secure?Would you recommend installing unattended updates?
 Are there any tools that can assess the security of a box? And make adjustments? 
 I&#x27;m a bit new to this, I&#x27;m interested to know what the industry standards are.
 Much appreciated!

                              <span>I work at a pretty good sized bank. Senior Management wishes to give out our Guest network SSID and password, without using our Network Access Control solution, to our customers. I was told that &quot;those portals are clunky and a terrible customer experience&quot;. I argued that the NAC would require them to resign every 8 hours (i.e. daily) and prevent our lobby from becoming a Cafe. I argued that the portal will provide a disclosure laying out terms of usage, etc. I also argued that there&#x27;s virtually no difference, in terms of effort, between typing a password vs. typing an email address.
 Any other arguments I can make to non-technical people?

                              <span>I really messed up today. I accidentally attached some other clients&#x27; emails while sending an email with a bunch of attachments to a new client. He totally freaked out and started asking why and what could happen to him with other clients.
 I&#x27;m fully aware it&#x27;s my mistake and this should not happen should&#x27;ve checked twice, even though I counted the attachments before clicking send. I&#x27;m not making excuses, but this Monday came with a bunch of incidents and I was backing up an absent colleague of mine. I&#x27;m a junior and I really screwed up.
 The situation is bad, I don&#x27;t know what will happen tomorrow.

                              <span>First off just want to say thank you for all the helpful info I’ve gotten here over the years. Never thought I would have one of these post but here we are admins. I have had 2 interviews today and pretty sure I bombed both. One I already know for sure. I am only interviewing now because my current remote job denied me working in another state and just said no which I don’t understand because we have out of state workers. 
 I’m tired of failing technical questions to dumb easy shit I haven’t used in 8 years and not getting a job. I’m tired of being laid off job after job due to shitty management, being outsourced, Covid 19, or being forced to look because my current position won’t help. I used to love doing this job, I have for over 10 years now, but I think God, the moon, or something is telling me to change it up. I’m frustrated, tired, and just pissed that I am 36 and having to potentially change careers because if I don’t my mental health is gonna send my physical into a spiral and I leave my wife a widow at 40. 
 If you read all of this thank you for joining my TedRant. I’m gonna go for a walk and try not to break down anymore today.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m just kinda going crazy, and needed some advice! I applied for a call center position with a small company in my home town. I got called for the interview, and when I showed up, they immediately said that they needed me on their IT department based on my Resume (10+ years of self employed computer repair experience). I&#x27;ve only done low level repair work, and some minor networking, and I was completely honest about that. Well they hired me as a salaried junior network engineer, and just told me to learn as much as I could, and that they understood that this would be a learning process for me. I&#x27;ve just finished my 90 days and I have had everything dumped on me by my supervisor from configuring firewall rules to setting up domain controllers with nothing more than a &quot;you&#x27;ll figure it out&quot;. Thankfully I&#x27;ve been able to handle all the craziness thrown at me, mainly because I&#x27;m excellent at troubleshooting, but I&#x27;ve been terrified this whole time, and I&#x27;m extremely fearful that I&#x27;ll mess something important up. I know I&#x27;m not qualified to do sysadmin duties just yet, but they&#x27;re forcing me to do it. I&#x27;ve been made global admin within my first month of being here. Is this just imposter syndrome, and I should keep going and pray for the best, or should I let them know that I&#x27;m feeling overwhelmed before I face an issue that could hurt my reputation. Sorry it&#x27;s so long just freaking out lol

I can&#x27;t find anyone in my peer groups that have used it, and neither of our cybersecurity partner companies have clients using it. Is it secure? Will it cause me issues in security audits? Any particular factors to use? Not use?
 Thank you all, in advance.

                              <span>Was hoping to reach out to see if any of you have any thoughts on this. I have a M365 tenant of about 70 users, and they are all online, using OneDrive/Teams/Sharepoint. Have been on this system for almost 4 years. Been very happy with it.
 But over the last 6 months or so, we are seeing a dramatic climb in space usage, and we have had to provision more sharepoint space accordingly. But...we dont know whats causing it.
 Most of the teams sites are private, so they dont show up as anything more than 0 when looking at space. And powershell reports to CSV dont show much change of hard drive space at all. 
 For example, over the weekend, 10GB used up. 
 Frankly, Im unimpressed with how M365 reports some of this, so I figure there must be a better way, but maybe not. Thought I would flip it to you all to see if anyone has run into this before, and some pointers?

We started the search for a replacement and are interviewing a fellow with years of experience, many certificates, and a Masters degree in Cybersecurity. As a full-time worker and a full-time student, I am so excited for this department to not fully rest on my shoulders and have a mentor to teach me the ways. I am counting down the minutes until we hire someone new!

 ​
 I receive weekly scans from the client who uses a Tenable (Nessus) scanner and this week&#x27;s finding included a High finding on a MS server. The finding is as follows:
 Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (September 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (September 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (October 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (December 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (December 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (January 2023) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (February 2023) Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (February 2023) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (April 2023) 
 My question is : 
 1- is it install enough Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (April 2023) and Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (February 2023) this finding? 
 ​
 thanks,

                              <span>I am checking to see if anyone else has had any issues with SPNEGO after installing the April patches on a 2012 R2 domain controller? We have any application that started failing authentication and it didn&#x27;t work again until we uninstalled the patches from the DCs. This app uses a keytab file using RC4 and we have updated the service account msds-supportedencryption type to RC4 (which is what allowed it to work after the November patches). Interestingly enough, another application using the same keytab / service account (I know bad practice) continued to work fine but it was using our updated 2019 domain controllers (the broken app can&#x27;t use these ones at the moment). I didn&#x27;t see anything specific in the patch info that would be a smoking gun for this issue.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I&#x27;m fairly new to GPO and I&#x27;m trying to create a task to get all PC&#x27;s to reboot every Friday. I&#x27;ve created an OU and placed all PC&#x27;s that need to have this applied in there and created a schedule task policy against the OU. I tested this by having my own PC in this ou, and it was the only one at the time for testing purposes, and it worked. Now that I&#x27;ve moved the rest of the PC&#x27;s in the OU it doesn&#x27;t work. To make sure I&#x27;m getting the policy applied I run gpupdate /r and see it there and when i run gpupdate /force... Immediately I open up task scheduler and I don&#x27;t see the task the policy is supposed to create.... The task was there during the testing though.... So I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong...🤔

                              <span>Context: We started using Defender as our AV for endpoints about a year ago since it&#x27;s included with out MS licensing. Prior to that, we were using ESET, and we are currently using it in our server environment.
 Right now, my boss and I are trying to figure out if Defender is a good fit for our on-prem servers. The only critical thing that they&#x27;re doing is DNS and DHCP management. None of them are open to the world. We have some internal teams using apps on different servers, but they&#x27;re not critical to the operation.
 Has anyone used Defender in their server environment? Why or why not? I&#x27;ll be transparent in saying that I&#x27;m not super familiar with either Defender nor ESET and am currently doing my research. I just like coming here to see what other people&#x27;s experiences are.

 Hey everyone,
 With the unknowns in the economy, which lower cost of living city (prefer small to mid-sized) would you suggest relocating to? Currently in a major city - new location should have plenty of available IT jobs (excluding help-desk). Please include pros and cons for suggestions. This is for the US. Considering the midwest and perhaps south, southeast. However, open to options if the area is right - relatively safe and housing options are not the size of a shoebox.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi!
 We host a domain-controller (2016) where they have been using folder redirection for some time.
 All of the devices are located on 4 other sites, connected with site-to-site VPN to the DC on the gateway-level.
 I want to revert this and move everything back to the local userprofiles.
 I ticked the box &quot;Redirect the folder back to the local userprofile location when policy is removed&quot;, made sure that was spinning for some days before setting &quot;Not configured&quot; on all the folder redirections one at a time every other day. (Just to prevent slowdowns)
 Nothing happened.
 Tried enabling one of them and set it to &quot;Redirect to the local userprofile location&quot; and restarted.
 Got an error in Event Viewer (502) stating that the path couldn&#x27;t be reached, it could be offline, even though I can ping and browse to \server\folder redirection.
 Any ideas on what might be wrong or other ways to move everything back to the respective user&#x27;s local profile?

                              <span>Looking to see if anyone has any pointers on where I can look for what is causing this issue.
 Domain joined W11 laptop with O365 installed and using Windows Remote Desktop. Using a L2TP/IPSec VPN to connect back to the office (when working from home). 
 When the user is in the office there is not a single issue. When they work from home through the VPN their account gets locked constantly. I have not seen any issues in AAD or on their computer. I have tried looking at the logs on my local AD as well but can not seem to find anything. I know I must be missing something.

We use DUO and have it on about 250 users and we are federated with Azure for DUO.

I do have a ticket open with MS about this because I am very concerned about how this will impact our company. 
 Has anybody else receive this notification and using another MFA other than the native Microsoft MFA in O365?

                              <span>Hi
 I have a new computer that is installed with a local computer account.
 The user has a Microsoft Bussiness Basic licence.
 We bought a Office 2019 proffesional plus license online.
 ( i like to add that we did this over a 100 times before and that went well all the time.)
 ok so now the issue:
 I start 1 of the office applications ( i does not matter wich one. in this case i use word)
  
The screen pop up comes that asks for a product key, so i put in the product key
 
i press activate office
 
a new screen comes that asks me to sign in.
 
when i enter the account its shows this account does not exist
 
 The same occurs when i log in to word first and then try to activate, same bad result.
 That why its so weird, ik can login to the office 2019 app and it reconizes the account, when i go activate office it shows account unknown. 
 I hope someone can help me....

I have the latest ADMX templates available for this as well, and I am trying to set the wallpaper for all users with the Desktop Wallpaper Policy in user configuration. It appears that this will not work no matter where I move the file on the machine. I am currently storing it in a few locations including, Public Downloads, the sysprep folder. It says it should work with a local path on the machine but it is not, however, it does work on the lock screen in the same location in the sysprep folder. Is there anything I can do to make this work? Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try to make this as brief as possible. We&#x27;re in the process of transitioning off our AS400 system. IBM said they would provide us with technical (hardware &amp; software) support until August (to get support even up until this date has taken direct appeals to IBM for extensions on our support contract). I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but that story and timeline has changed to April 30th.
 (I believe it was simply human error on our end, a misread or something, but that is really irrelevant here and now.) 
 So, now we are scrambling to find a viable option for hardware support for this interim period (4-6 months) until we&#x27;ve fully switched to a new system. And to be clear, the team that setting up our new system is not equipped to handle support requests that might come in for the existing AS400 system.
 ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: we are a rather small - I&#x27;d like to say almost mom/pop type - manufacturer in Northern New Jersey (Carlstadt, Bergen County). They&#x27;ve used the AS400 for nearly 30/35 years and what little tech expertise we had, has long ago left. I&#x27;m a new (~2 years) web designer and developer (and unfortunately, the all around IT person) here and the only person with adequate and competent technical skills. So i&#x27;ve been asked for help with this. 
 I&#x27;d be happy to answer questions if anyone has any relevant, but I am hoping experts out there might have some solid advice for me on where to start looking. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE TO ANYONE THAT TAKES THE TIME TO READ AND APPLY, I APPRECIATE IT.

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m curious how people have approached structuring non-production environments with respect to Active Directory. 
 Are you isolating your non-production (eg: dev/uat/preproduction) environment sytems/users in separate OUs but under the main/production AD domain? Do you use a separate AD domain in the same forest? 
 Any input or suggestions are appreciated! Thank you

                              <span>Has anyone used Intunes and Bitlocker before? We had it setup inhouse and used the pin option. Now we&#x27;ve moved it to intunes we have the pin option but also want the password only option for machines that can&#x27;t have Windows 11.
 I have some machines that are having issues with the password option. TPM isn&#x27;t available but you can use password instead. Type in the password when the pop-up appears and it goes to encrypt but just throws back &quot;Failed to encrypt C&quot; but gives no error.
 Anyone had issues with this before?

 I started a business and needing a mailserver. I have different domains on my Cloudflare account which i want to use.
 Im going to use google workspace mainly with domain A.
 I also have domain B which is used by my services (git etc. to send emails)
 I also have domain C and D which are for my customers. 
 So im looking at a mail hosting with different tiers for example a lite tier with almost none features except sending emails and a tier which can be used as a daily mail.
 Does anyone know such a hoster?
 Looked at Mailbox.org and Zoho mail but idk if there is something better.
 Thank you all! Would be nice if someone could help me!

 I&#x27;m writing here because it&#x27;s been 1 week since i started research for my problem, and i can&#x27;t find any solution for now.
 The problem : 
 PC on domain sometimes can&#x27;t do a gpupdate /force and get the following error in terminal : 
  
The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows attempted to read the file &quot;\\our.domain.fr\sysvol\our.domain.fr\Policies\{GPO-UID}\gpt.ini&quot; from a domain controller and was not successful. Group Policy settings may not be applied until this event is resolved. This issue may be transient and could be caused by one or more of the following:

                              <span>Our Outlook signatures contain images promoting our upcoming events. We rotate these images every 2-3 weeks.
 Currently, our marketing teams sends an email around, asking everyone to update their signature, but this (obviously) is very annoying and I quite often see users with outdated signatures.
 What I tried:
  
Disclaimer in Microsoft 365 Exchange - not feasible because it doesn&#x27;t support images and would require IT to build HTML from whatever the marketing team comes up with.
 Set-OutlookSignatures - Doesn&#x27;t seem reliable. I had it fail for some mailboxes and couldn&#x27;t figure out the reason for the errors &quot;mailbox does not exist&quot;. It&#x27;s decently documented, but it&#x27;s OSS after all with no real support.
 Third party solutions - They cost like 5 bucks per user per month and I cannot get that budget approved. Also, an Outlook plugin alone doesn&#x27;t really do it, because it cannot be used on Mac, phones or Outlook Web.
  
Ideally, I need a way to attach content from a Word document to all emails, so that the marketing team can change and update the signature on their own. We have around 35 employees.
 Any reliable, low-maintenance, not-too-expensive solutions you would recommend for an organziation with 35 employees?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking for a server lift for our server rooms. Untill now we&#x27;ve handled all servers/storage by hand, and in ways that would send a health and safety officer off to go rock themselves to sanity in a corner. 
 Our server rooms are wrongly set out, but thats the way it&#x27;s going to remain... We have pretty small &quot;aisles&quot; Infront of each rack, so if we were to get a lift it would need to be quite small wheel based.
 Do any of you have something in mind? Either electric or manual crank is fine.
 Thanks

Management refused to hire another IT guy because of &quot;budget constraints&quot;. I got mentally burned out and took a 1 week leave. I was overthinking about tickets, angry calls and network outage. After one week, I went back to work again and to my surprise, the world didn&#x27;t burn. No network outage.

                              <span>Firstly I wanna say I&#x27;m a bit of a &quot;noob&quot; right now when it comes to this stuff, but I&#x27;m trying to understand. Just got a job as an It Support which won&#x27;t include just regular helpdesk tasks but also more and more administrator stuff etc... So there&#x27;s a few things I wanna ask.
 We&#x27;re a company of around 60 employees and are expanding pretty fast, so we have to put some more effort on the safety side of things. Right now we have a shared network domain (is this the right term?) Where we have access to the same files etc... Now we&#x27;d also like to have a local? domain, where all users would fall under one place and at login you&#x27;d have that thing where you can log in to user or into administrator. We also have 4-5 MacOS users. How would that go, to have windows and mac on the same AD? What to use? Co-worker was mentioning LDAP and FREEIPA? I also saw something about NoMAD? Is there a way to have two factor authentication to log-in to windows?
 + when we&#x27;d have all of that set up, what would be the best tool to manage everything? Right now we&#x27;re using Synology I think, for granting access to users for certain files... I also saw something about JAMF?
 ​
 Sorry if all of this is written poorly, as I said, currently my understanding of all off this is not the best, but I&#x27;d like to come up with a suggestion or two of &quot;my own&quot;, if any of you would have a suggestion or two or point me in the right direction, that would be great.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>i just installed windows server 2022 on my vps &amp; when i try to install an ethernet driver, it doesn&#x27;t give an installation popup of &quot;Would you like to install this device software?&quot; but it just automatically installs the driver &amp; shows a confirmation of &quot;windows has successfully updated your drivers&quot;. but the internet connection still remains offline even after reboot. 
 i had previously used the same driver on a different vps provider (vultr) &amp; it worked flawlessly there meaning after installing the ethernet driver, it instantly connected to the internet.
 edit: i&#x27;m thinking becoz the windows not asking my permission to install the driver, it for some reason isn&#x27;t installing the driver correctly even though it appears on device manager menu. i don&#x27;t know what exactly is the issue, so i&#x27;m just spitballing here.
 Ethernet driver: Red Hat VirtlO Ethernet Adapter
 My VPS Spec:
 EPYC (3rd Gen) 4 vCores @ 2.8+ GHz
 8 GB RAMDDR4 ECC
 160 GB SSD RAID 10 (NVMe)

Nothing too hard. I&#x27;ve been building my own PCs and supporting my home network for years, but nothing really intensive or homelabby. My dad must have told his boss I work in IT because I basically have a job offer I did not apply for.
 The company: A small woodshop that does very well. There are 4 end user laptops that are shared amongst the workers, and the owner wants a server and WLAN setup so the users can collaborate with a specific program. I have not yet been told what this…</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 I’m seeking the internet’s help on any other logs (client or server) that I might have missed with a problem that impacted many DHCP clients in a virtualized datacenter network.
 Over the course of about 15 hours, nearly 45 virtual servers lost their DNS settings. Our VMs are all Windows Server based and our DHCP server is Windows DHCP.
 They changed to 0.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.0 based on a bonafide observation of a sample machine (via console) and through S1 logging on the below changed registry value.
 I correlated our S1 logs showing when the registry value DhcpNameServer changed from what they’re supposed to be to 2 x quad zeros with my DHCP server logs and I see a lot of action on that registry value that didn’t correlate to a DHCP log entry and I also see lots of correlation befor…</span>

                              <span>Hello! I’m curious about popular opinion on this topic. I have a closed network that cannot touch general internet. Can’t reach google, Microsoft, etc. This is on purpose. But we have around 40 VMs, several switches, router, etc. What is the best software that can monitor most, if not all aspects. I’m mostly interested in the networking pieces and if there are issues with them, but also curious if some great software can monitor servers as well. Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m a solo admin with two sites and roughly 100 users combined. Both sites have a mix of different OSes and device types.
 I&#x27;m struggling to find tools to effectively manage all my systems and I&#x27;m looking for &quot;turn-key&quot; or &quot;set-and-forget&quot; tools that I can implement to make things easier. Both orgs are non-profits so budget is going to be the deciding factor.
 I&#x27;ve looked at a few FOSS options for various tasks, but the vast majority are self-hosted and for someone who has next to no Linux, Docker, etc experience and no time to maintain them, a lot of FOSS isn&#x27;t viable.
 One tool in particular that I&#x27;m looking for is a way to manage logs from various sources (firewall, servers, etc.).

                              <span>So I have currently a Server 2016 based RDS farm using roaming profiles. Everything is working just fine there. Whenever we install office in the OfficeDeploymentTool config file I have the information to use roaming licensing tokens
 Property Name&#x3D;&quot;SCLCacheOverride&quot; Value&#x3D;&quot;1&quot; /&gt;   
 Everything works just the way it should on those servers.
 So now im looking to move up to Server2019 based RDS host. I install office the same way, but on the 2019 host it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever download the token. When you open office products you are greeted with a &quot;Sign in to setup office&quot; you click ok then get &quot;Activate Office&quot; At that point it ask for your email. Plug that information in but then it never ask for a password. Then all your office products get the pink banner up top stating &quot;problem with shared computer licensing&quot; I looked at the registry entries and those are correct. If I log into the 2016 RDS, activate office then copy one of the tokens. I can log out of the 2016 then come back to the 2019 and the token roams over and office is activated and just fine. Its just the initial downloading of the tokens that 2019 seems to be having a problem with. Is there something I&#x27;m missing about getting it working on 2019?

I was basically doing junior admin work or close to it. On top of actively engineering solutions that were truly automated. But my Job titled never really reflected it, in fact they had no &quot;sys admins&quot; on the docket. You where either a Tech or an Engineer. And Senior Tech&#x27;s did a lot of &quot;sys admin work&quot;. 
 How do I sell my self to a Sys. Admin team? Or even a Support team at this rate?
  
So I&#x27;m having a fustrating job search. Current Company is total ass, gave me lay off notice due soon. (Yet now their talking different after making me go through that, training my own replacements currently! My replacement(s) aren&#x27;t not faring well despite me actually trying to train them! )

 I&#x27;m super fed up and want to leave and collect severance anyways.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into an offline archival solution for a NAS that has something like 12TB. It&#x27;s a TrueNAS with 2 vdevs with 3 5tb each. I&#x27;m mainly storing immutable information, photos. I also have a different pool on the same NAS that has snapshots but I would like to move the snapshots out of the same hardware to make it more robust. I really would like to avoid cloud storage and I&#x27;m looking for a cost effective solution. 
 From the information that I was able to gather, looks like M Disk Bluray could be the solution. Anyone have any experience with it or have any other suggestions?

 SCCM is overkill I think and I don&#x27;t have a person to manage that platform anyway.
 Does anyone have experience with azure arc? even if we have no workloads on azure that looks like an interesting option.
 is there anything else I haven&#x27;t thought of?
 The environment is relatively static. GPOs and WSUS take care of patching right now. Most of the applications running on these machines are unique snowflakes that don&#x27;t work well with automation. So things are...ok.
 However whenever we want to make a small change to servers or deploy some kind of agent or new tool, its a pain in the ass without central management.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Network Administrator for a private aerospace manufacturing company. We&#x27;re moving to a 150,000 sq ft facility and the owner is insisting all network access be wireless. I get pushback every time I recommend running cable. 200 users with mostly desktop workstations. We don&#x27;t have a VDI. Some controls for the large mill machines need to be networked and are running embedded Win2k. Wireless network coverage is 20 access points, 5 medium density for office areas, 15 low density for manufacturing floor and was quoted and approved by the facilities manager. Supervisor offices have been built in several areas on manufacturing floor with metal roofs.
 Donations of copium greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I hope someone can shed some light on the issue one of my customers is having. About a month ago someone purchased a domain that was very similar to my customers domain. They started sending a bunch of phishing emails. Long story short, the phishing domain got banned and removed but ever since then, the legitimate customer domain has been having email delivery problems. By that, I mean that SOME users&#x27; emails in/out and going straight to spam. They use Office 365 as their email platform and cloudflare as DNS. Further to that they use SendGrid for marketing emails.
 I message traced user A- some emails that he sends go to spam. This also applied to incoming emails.
 Message tracked user B- emails work just fine, they go to inbox. Same for incoming emails, they go to inbox right awa…</span>

 I got surprised today when i used Googles find my device feature to locate my phone to see that there were 2 devices signed in to with the account, my phone and another phone model which i don&#x27;t have or have ever owned
 So i went into account settings and saw that the strange device was signed in to more than 100 days ago which is strange because i had not created that account
 Could it mean my new account was someone&#x27;s previous gmail account that they deleted ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently researching the implementation of ADCS in our infrastructure.
 Our infra contains 2 main offices (Site1, Site2) connected via site-to-site VPN connection (different location in the same city) and both have AD running under 2 DCs on each site. In the coming months, we&#x27;ll be having 2 extra branch offices (in different locations) as well.
 From what I&#x27;m reading, the best case scenario is to go with a two-tier PKI ADCS consisting of: 
  
CA-01 - RootCA - No domain-joined, running on a VM and shut down.
 CA-02 - Subordindate CA - Domain-joined running on physical server - Site1
 CA-03 - Subordindate CA - Domain-joined running on physical server - Site2
  
The use for ADCS is to provide user/computer authentication on the local network (LAN, WiFi), user authentication for VPN/Remot…</span>

I went to do this recently though and the old url isnt accessible &quot;The specified key does not exist&quot;. How can I change the url of the object to what it used to be so its accessible from the old url??? Any help would be awesome as I am stumped on how to do it

                              <span>All active DCs are on 2019 so we are able to raise it. Just have an old RODC on 2008 that doesn&#x27;t have domain services installed anymore which needs to be removed before going ahead.
 Does it matter what OS domain joined computers are on? From everything I&#x27;ve read only the lowest DC server version matters. So if you have a 2016 DC and a 2022 DC you can raise to 2016 domain functional level.

Since a few months this somehow broke. Users get the message that there are connection problems when trying to change their password. It&#x27;s clearly not a connection problem but something in the configuration that broke. Only way to change the password is on the local AD. Admins can&#x27;t change it in AzureAD either. I&#x27;ve already tested the sync and password settings with the AD sync tool and everything showed as working. Any pointers where to look to fix this problem?

                              <span>I really can&#x27;t decide between those to options. Since I&#x27;m part of the lastpass breach I don&#x27;t want to have a cloude based password manager anymore. In my opinion, my network / server wouldn&#x27;t be that attractive to hacker like servers from bitwarden.
 But I&#x27;m not sure what I should set up. Would you trust the open source solution vaultwarden, which is bitwarden in some way or rather pay bitwarden.
 I want to install the password manager on my NAS using docker. The passwordmanger won&#x27;t be open to the WAN, only my DSM for (Drive, Photos, ...)
 What would you pick?

Can I have an SSD disk and periodically (once a week) connect it to a power supply or a computer to &quot;refresh&quot; the charges? Is there a way to determine if my USB flash drive refreshes the data automatically when I plug it in?
 Or it&#x27;s best to delete the data with the Secure Erase unit command or similar method and then rewrite it?
 If I make a second copy does this guarantee to make a copy of the data or there are algorithms for deduplication that prevent it? My experience is that writing the data twice is about twice as slow, therefore I assume no deduplication happens. But I am not sure about all devices.
 My main concern with not erasing the drive and writing the data again is that the file allocation table may get damaged because some of the bits are not overwritten (refreshed). And I may get a random gibberish when I try to read my files.

                              <span>I’m in a new role, and the company has no automation re deploying software/ deploying OS / deploying apps etc. We also would have same level Of mobile Phones to manage.
 Would intune be the best option here? We are not fully in the cloud. Over half of users office is migrated to office 365. Is SCCM still an option 
 Basically just looking for a solution to make the above make sense and be easily Managed .

                              <span>A little background before I ask the question. I have been in IT for over 10 years. At my current job for 7 of that 10. Started as a deskside tech then network admin and as of 4 years ago a sysadmin. My manager at the time saw me doing more than just the network so he wanted to give me a different title as I worked with all the systems. The only way for me to make more than the 5% a year raise is to become a SR sysadmin. We had three SR sysadmins and then me up until 2 years ago when 2 randomly left. I stepped up and became lead on all major projects because I was skilled in many areas. The remaining SR was just apps and that is it. I worked with the Manger at the time to change my title and he wanted to base the requirements off of the past SRs job descriptions. I was ok with this because my skills and projects matched it. Thought I had it in the bag.... then the manager left.... nothing had been finalized or in writing. A new manager has been brought in and believes a SR is based off how many Certificates you have. Nothing is changing his mind. I asked if they would pay for them and he said yes. So I want to brush up on them and just start scheduling. I have had plenty early on to help my growth but they expired. He probably does not believe my talent and I want to hold him to it. Kind of a malicious compliance. Maybe he is trying to save money while under paying me for as long as he can...
 Question: would it become an issue if I started taking one every two weeks? Would is cause me any issues? Like would they question whether I was cheating or not? 
 I attend yearly training for any upcoming projects. As an example. When we moved to palo alto firewalls I took a week long boot camp and got certified 4 years ago.(expired in oct) We planned to move to azure. So I took another bootcamp to get ready. About to attend a bootcamp for my CISSP.

                              <span>I have a scenario where for reasons beyond my control it seems, I have a cellular interface that is losing its IP that it gets from the provider and the only way to get it back is to bounce the interface. I have created this sla to bounce the port if ping fails. 
 My issue is, it seems that it bounces the port just as the router is completed booting and does not give any time for a genuine IP to be received. So essentially my sla is too sensitive, and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s required or whether its possible to have it delay sla checking on boot to let everything settle in.
 ​
 All advice is welcome, thanks

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m trying to find an SMB grade router to replace the one we currently have (TP-Link Archer MR400 w/ 4G LTE), in order to support more devices.
 Some context:
 Currently, we already have around ~60 devices and we&#x27;re starting to see problems with some devices being unreachable once we add new ones to the network.
 These are IoT devices (Shelly1 and Shelly Pro1), so the network traffic, while busy (mainly MQTT keep alive messages and similar payloads), shouldn&#x27;t be the actual problem, rather it seems we&#x27;re just hitting the maximum number of supported devices connected simultaneously.
 We have two locations (~400m distance) that share the same network. The IoT devices are located in two cabinets in each site.
 On the main site, we have a mix of Shelly1&#x27;s connected via Wi-Fi and Shelly Pro1&#x27;s connected by cable (RJ45) to the router.
 On the second site we only have Shelly1&#x27;s, which connect to an access point that is then connected via cable to the router in the main site.
 Technically, most devices connect to the router by cable, rather than Wi-Fi.
 Given we&#x27;ll be adding more devices (cable only, no Wi-Fi) in the near future, we want something that could handle from 100 to ~200 devices.
 I found related questions here, here and here, but didn&#x27;t quite help.
 Could you share your experiences in similar scenarios and what you have used?
 I appreciate your time.
 Cheers,
 Q

 For whatever reason i&#x27;m getting: 
 Failed to generate API key: Invalid Credential 
 to which i have no clue why! It IS the correct username and password and its the default admin account as well.
 Anyone any ideas?

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m about to start a pretty large migration of Cisco ASA firewalls to Palo Alto 3320&#x27;s, the main things i&#x27;m looking to migrate are the correct object groups (there is a LOT of crap DM_INLINE object groups that i want to leave off), firewall rules and NAT rules.
 I was thinking of doing a manual self audit and skipping any potential issues that the migration tool might bring up or if there is a learning curve involved in terms of setting the thing up.
 If i did set it up, would i be able to click and choose what object groups i&#x27;d like to migrate? Same for rules and NAT rules?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I want to ask you if the firewall cluster ( that is draw in the diagram, bellow it&#x27;s a similar diagram ) it&#x27;s &quot;in the right place&quot;.
 https://content.spiceworksstatic.com/service.community/p/post_images/0000339409/5c19c899/attached_image/filejpeg.jpg
 I also have some pure site to site vpn ipsec with others that it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot; the ISR routers.
 On the ISR routers i also want to do the NAT + IPSEC site to site vpn + Anyconnect
 Can you also please come with other ideas/opinon ? It&#x27;s a good design ? bad design ?
 the actual network right now it&#x27;s in a bad shape and that&#x27;s why i need to redesign the things.
 It&#x27;s a not a big network behind ( 200 - 300 users something like that and more of them are practically remote and connecting via the anyconnect ).
 Also there are some servers behind ( 2 vcenters with some virtual servers + storage ).
 What do you thing ?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a layer 3 switch with a handful of vlans and SVI configured. I need to configure inter-VLAN multicast routing.
 The source and receivers are in separate subnets which terminate on the layer 3 switch.
 Multicast traffic does not need to route beyond the layer 3 switch.
 Can I just: 
 enable ‘ip multicast routing’ globally and ‘ip pim dense-mode’ on the SVI’s?
 Or is it better to:
 enable a loopback on the L3 switch, configure ‘ip PIM rp-address ’
 Configure ‘ip pim sparse-mode’ on the SVI
 Configure IGMP snooping on the downstream L2 switch ports? Is this required or just preferable?
 Or are both approaches wrong? 
 I have never needed to configure mcast until now and my only experience is reading the CCNP ENCOR OCG / watching Kevin Wallace videos / googling around. 
 Would either of the above approaches work or have I missed something crucial due to inexperience?
 Thanks as always!

                              <span>Can someone explain to me the advantages/disadvantages of one of these vs.the other?
 I ran into a small law office the other day, their previous IT guy sold them a windows server, a fortigate firewall and a Nas for storage.
 I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around why anyone would choose this type of firewall for a small office that has 5-7 employees.
 When asked what is the purpose of the server is the owner doesn&#x27;t even know. They only use the Nas for their data but that is a discussion for another time. My concern right now is why fortigate? Is it that much better than a Sonicwall or a pfsense?

                              <span>Just completed an overhaul of a nightmare network cabinet at a lab. I can&#x27;t post before/after images here unfortunately. 
 I&#x27;ve used a 15U wall mount cabinet that houses some fans at the top, an Adva box, a Cisco box, a Draytek router, two 24 port patch panels, two 24 port Netgear switches and a PDU.
 I left a 1U gap between all the active equipment units. I mounted a 1U horizontal cable management bar between each patch panel and network switch. There&#x27;s no spare space left in the cabinet.
 I used 50cm patch cables as I read this is the minimum certified length. However, the patch cables have ended up looking messy as there&#x27;s no way to make them look neat unless I used shorter cables which I&#x27;m kinda reluctant to.
 So the question is, did I goof and should have gotten a bigger cabinet and left 2U for the patch cables or should I just go with shorter patch cables?
 Patchsave sell 10cm and 20cm ones.

                              <span>Well, after 7 years in RMF/GRC roles I have had enough and it is not the right fit (ok, I actually decided after year 1 but am just making the move now lol). I love technology and building things and think a career in networking is a better fit.
 I need to make a plan to get an entry level role in networking and need some assistance.
 ---------------------------------
 Wants:
  
I need a degree: I know WGU is nice and I can obtain CCNA shortly after. Anyone have any better recommendations? Cost is not an issue but time is, I want to finish it as fast as I can.
 I need certs: I only hold CISSP and Sec + (expired). I plan on CCNA and possibly some AWS certs (architect and dev ops associates).
 I need a job: I need to land an entry level networking role that can get me the experience needed to progress in the field.
 Future: I eventually want to progress to network engineer or network security engineer. Am not entirely sure what credentials (other than experience) I would need for this career.
  
---------------------------------
 Experience/me: 
  
I am 40 years old and retired military, am I too old? I know age discrimination is a real thing in this field.
 8 years military related IT roles in IT security. All RMF and compliance focused.
 4 of those years I did light sys admin work for classified networks. Helped design and build a few network segments and have hands on with VOIP, VTC, encryption (TACLAN) and Active Directory.
 Fluent in Linux (was studying for OSCP) and win environments. 
 Have studied for AWS certs and could prob pass the dev ops assoc. in two months time. CCNA would prob take me month or so as well.
  
---------------------------------
 So, what are your thoughts, recommendations or concerns? 
 If you have any advice or experience making a transition like this I would love to hear from you as well.
 Any ideas on how I can make this plan better or more efficient please let me know as well.
 Actually, any advice would be helpful.

                              <span>The chaotic footage from rioting in Chicago as well as the shooting of a young black man who knocked on the wrong door this week have sparked more discussion of “systemic racism”, policing and public policy.  In this episode, we talk with Manhattan Institute fellow Heather Mac Donald, bestselling author of “When Race Trumps Merit,” about how the concepts of systemic racism and “disparate impact” have shaped the nation.

 Current I guess you would call me a junior sysadmin. I support about 6 very small schools, all using windows systems. I&#x27;m pretty confident in day to day tasks with windows server, win 10, and iPad support at this point.
 In your opinion, if I were to start looking at finding a new job, would you recommend upskilling further with windows server to the point I could potentially be a sysadmin on my own for a smaller business. Start learning everything I can about Linux systems (I have literally 0 experience with Linux) or look into cloud systems such as Azure or something else? Where do you see the most opportunities being opened up?

                              <span>Hi, I’m a security guy by trade but figured you all would have the most experience to answer my question.
 I have a ton of MFA codes I use for work and I need a good iOS app that I can have a backup and is easy to switch and restore on another device.
 I already have Okta for my company stuff and Microsoft’s app for that stuff but a lot of our clients SIEMs need MFA so I have like 20+ codes I used daily.
 I initially set up Duo on my Android since IT recommended that for storing backups in Google Drive, but then I got my work equipment and they sent me an iPhone so I would like to move everything over.
 Some people recommended Airbus. What’s your recommendation? I don’t want to have to annoy engineering to reset my SIEM creds if I choose a shitty app that causes problems.

                              <span>This may be the wrong place to ask but hoping someone can help. I have a client I’m helping out who has a legacy Novar Savvy system that he inherited with the building he bought. It is connected to the network via an Ethernet cable. However I’ve been digging around and calling lots of people and finally got ahold of someone at Honeywell, and they told me point blank “ESS32 has been end of life and support for nearly 10 years. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m going to be able to get you a copy of it.”
 So I’m hoping someone here maybe has a copy of it somewhere. Any ideas? 
 Thanks in advance.

 I don&#x27;t get to or have to do it much anymore but I enjoy watching Spacesniffer scan drives that are full. Cleaning them up and scanning again. 
 Endpoint Central (previously Desktop Central) system patching is relaxing once the patches are verified not to crash everything.

                              <span>I have a project that i am setting up some new servers with security baselines using DSC instead of GPOs. That&#x27;s all good and the systems are getting configured ok.
 1) I can only assume that because these servers are domain joined the users who login carry policies from the OUs they live and that will be applied when the user logs in. Is this correct? Are there any implications if DSC configures the computer and GPO configures the user portion only?
 2) How can i configure restricted groups? Any idea? Do i need to resort to configuring the local groups explicitly instead ?? I am thinking to create a GPO with the restricted groups and try and export it as a baseline then merge is in my DSC config... Just a thought. Has anyone tried something like that?
 3) In case i need to build a standalone server with DSC security baselines only, how am i going to configure any user settings ? Is this possible ?
 3) Is there a loopback analogue in the DSC like the GPO?
 These are pretty much late night thoughts, i am going to crack on in the lab one of these days testing all these however i would like to hear from more experienced sysadmins just in case i save myself a lot of testing time!
 Thanks!

 I can&#x27;t get this working but I know our old VPN, configured form within Windows, had it showing on the login screen which is something we need the ability to do. 
 Any advice on this front?

                              <span>Hey guys!
 There is likely going to be a potential opening for a new sysadmin role at my company, my manager is pushing really hard for me to get the promotion due to my previous training in Active Directory and network administration.
 However, we have a hybrid environment and while I&#x27;ve been really good at picking up on how to administer the various technologies we use (Intune, SharePoint, etc)
 Does anyone have any recommendations on certifications or recommended training?
 For background our full environment is hybrid AD/AAD with AD Connect Sync, SharePoint, Exchange, and Intune for MDM/MAM.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at MS-100-101 as our C-Suite is starting to take cyber-security pretty seriously and also AZ-800-801 as well.
 I&#x27;m also working on developing my Powershell skills.
 I&#x27;m passable at them but want to get much better at using it to make writing automation scripts and tasks easier.
 Any suggestions would be very helpful, sorry if this is posted a lot but I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the FAQ so I&#x27;d figured I&#x27;d make a post.

While enjoying my Saturday getting ready to work on the house smile on my face the phone rings....&quot;We all just got kicked out of the system with this weird message that it is in a backup state?&quot; &quot;Oh fuck.&quot; You see I schedule this system to go down back itself up and switch over to the next day. This is supposed to be 11:30PM well after hours. Well my friends, not noticing the key to switch it from AM by default to PM didn&#x27;t take, the entire system went down midway through their Saturday shift. There is no recovering the rest of the business day it cannot be stopped. Called the VP owned my mistake after remoting in and verifying this is exactly what happened. So how is yalls Saturday going?

                              <span>Besides the trust these numbers convey for “reputable” organizations and the need for them before cell phones and no charges to call long distance from a cell or residential landline, why are these still being used? 
 I’m reviewing my org’s toll free DIDs and none of them have been used in a year. Is there still a market for this? We don’t publish ours and our outgoing ANI is the local number.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m a CS major and have interned as a Software Engineer and Backend developer (modeling, testing and implementing DB&#x27;s) but to be honest i don&#x27;t want to develop Applications at all as a fulltime job because that doesn&#x27;t really seem fulfilling to me. I rather have a direct impact on other Developers and teams / the people around me! 
 I do enjoy programming though, especailly Python to automate things with. I&#x27;ve been reading a little about sysadmin stuff and i do know the basics of bash scripting, know how to get around, use VIM, i&#x27;ve done a Kali linux class that was pretty extensive and have my CCNA from my Networking class in school and most important i quite enjoyed learning all that. 
 What i&#x27;m wondering is, are there jobs that kind of mix these things together? Where i can automate things, develop solutions for Developers around me while still leveraging my computer science / coding skills?

 My mentor/college always frustrated at teaching me. Eventhough he never say it but i can feel his emotion.
 One day he was teaching me about print server and how to fix it. I just cant understand what is he saying.
 I always drawing smth when we have downtime. I feel tired in this field. I dont know what to do.

 We have client who is getting an error when trying to enable a new certificate template. The error is not specific to one single template but to all new certificate templates. Also, they have many actively working certificates despite this issue. When they try to enable a new certificate template, they get the following error message:
 “The template information on the CA cannot be modified at this time. This is most likely because the CA service is not running or there are replication delays. The parameter is incorrect. 0x80070057 (Win32: 87 ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER)
 The Changes can be saved to Active Directory and retrieved by the CA next time it is started. Do you want to save the changes to Active Directory?”
 They don’t want to save to AD, because the error is just wrong – the CA …</span>

                              <span>I’m stumped on this one and so is everyone in our org. The program runs fine when we launch it on workstations within our main building using a batch command that calls the program through a shared drive. However, we&#x27;re running into issues when we try to launch the program on remote hosts outside of our second building and over VPN.
 When we run the batch command in these situations, we can see active connections to the server over SMB, but the program doesn&#x27;t actually launch on the remote host. It&#x27;s as if the Java connection isn&#x27;t going over the WAN/VPN. We&#x27;ve already reached out to our network team, server team, and the vendor, but nobody has been able to provide a solution yet.
 We&#x27;ve checked our firewall settings, network settings, and DNS settings, but haven&#x27;t found any issues there. We&#x27;ve also tried running the program directly on the remote host, but that didn&#x27;t work either.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure this has been discussed here ad-naseum, but here goes nothing
 Have any (or all) of you experienced the pain of being forced to implement a system due to poor research, lack of communication, lack of knowledge, and just not understanding the existing systems implementation by a top level manager?
 How did you deal with it? I&#x27;m so tired of having to remind people who should know better that, in this day and age (old man yells at cloud), all major businesses are IT focused. Everything that deals with communications, advertising, data processing, analytics, word processing, email, all of the business rules, are related, if not directly under, technology. The business is an IT company providing services through technology.
 If anything tech related goes south fast, money stops flowing. 
 Communications? Lost money. Email down? Lost money. Shitty business rules? Lost money. Bad system purchases? Lost money.
 When will it be common knowledge that everything in a business relies on IT, infrastructure, database management, networking, backups, yadda yadda yadda.
 To the VPs who make 3 times as much as the poor bastards being forced to make a square peg fit in a round hole, being told that &quot;well others are doing it, you just need to learn&quot;, being pulled in 15 directions because your word document emergency is more important than project progress: the business is an IT business that provides a market service. All of it. 
 Thinking of trying to integrate a sweet, shiny, and slick constant contact suite? IT
 New company policy that affects payments? Include IT
 Considering purchasing new monitors? Include IT
 Key cards? Include IT
 Entire systems? Include IT
 Reporting software? Include IT
 New building? Include IT

                              <span>Hey crew,
 I read a post on here a while back asking how one can reasonably use Power Apps to help alleviate some IT admin tasks, where one specific request was how to create new users with Power Apps. Since I was learning Power Apps development anyway, I took it upon myself to do create a &quot;User Administration&quot; app, so that HR for example could create new users and assign them to groups, without help from the IT department. I now hate Power Apps and Microsoft and my life. 
 Power Apps is clunky, tedious to develop in, and the licensing makes neither logical nor business sense when one realizes that all the &quot;good&quot; features are premium and Power Apps for Teams is the cut-rate model.
 All my bitching aside, the app is done, and I have thoroughly documented (no bullshit YouTube videos, I promise) the process of:
  
Creating an App using the free built-in connectors to MS365/Azure AD
 Realizing that these connectors won&#x27;t cut it and redoing everything with premium connectors
 Getting the app finished and ready for y&#x27;all to download
  
I hope y&#x27;all find my experience or app helpful and if you would like to try to implement something like this in production, please let me know, and I will help if I can. Thanks r/sysadmin, my favorite, commiserating subreddit!

                              <span>I am wondering if this is a familiar story.
 Few months back we had an urgent ticket come in, estates had installed some expensive new building management (BMS) kit and now needed all the sensors networked in, some in really funky locations - think underground access conduits and roof spaces. Obviously without any heads up to IT. Not a simple fix, and thus it&#x27;s one of those calls that emails start getting cc&#x27;d to directors and people are getting angry.
 So we run with it and design where we need to run new fibre, what devices we will place where, well documented and scope done, but because of the complications in this work (think drilling a couple of 6&quot; reinforced concrete walls that are both firestops and holding up a 5 story building above) we pass back the documents to estates (who have qualified surveyors) and say can you can you please manage and implement.
 That was 6 months ago and nothing happened.
 Doesn&#x27;t bother me, not my issue if project happens or not, but the underlying issue is just the expectations people have outside of IT, but never expect the same elsewhere.
 Off to make a coffee.

 I receive weekly scans from the client who uses a Tenable (Nessus) scanner and this week&#x27;s finding included a High finding on a MS server. The finding is as follows:
 ​
 Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (May 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET core (June 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (August 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft ASP.NET Core (September 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (September 2022) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (October 2022) 
 ​
 Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (January 2020) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (May 2020) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (July 2020) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (August 2020) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (September 2020) Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (October 2020) 
 ​
 My question is : 
 ​
 1- is it install enough Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework (October 2020) and Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Core (October 2022) this finding? 
 ​
 thanks,

                              <span>I’ve interviewed for a slew of jobs here recently. All requiring about 2 years of experience in respect to skills required. I’m not too sure, but I always get this unsettled feeling that the interviewer is always looking for a individual with 5+ years and some super articulated definition of the tools and technology that you use. 
 Is this a symptom of imposter syndrome?

                              <span>Hey guys, I want to get into learning sysadmin. So, I tried installing Linux on my laptop, but with each distro I tried, the problem was the same: the brightness controls are inverted and the max brightness is too low.
 I tried many fixes for it, but they didn&#x27;t work. So I decided to install Windows Subsystem for Linux on the PC (using Ubuntu 22.04LTS).
 My question is that is this setup fine for learning basic sysadmin? (I am a college fresher with no experience in this domain at all)

                              <span>Well on the 20th, we did a migration from Exchange to 365 🫠 an awful day to do that I suppose. Walked in today (03/21) and no emails were working - program that was downloaded on users computer to automatically convert Outlook profiles didn’t work. My first ever time doing it - Office 2019 we just had to restart a few hundred computers and the program would pop up to configure the profile (not suppose to require a restart anyways) Office 2016 users we had to apply latest patch, then restart and the program would work to configure new profile. I’ve been having to tell people to use the OWA until I can get to them. Then found out that Microsoft is having 365 admin issues on top of it. I did not think it would be this hard. All this is a hit or miss operation.

                              <span>Hi everyone. Last year I got a new job as IT Specialist for an engineer company that has grown at an incredibly fast pace in recent years. The biggest problem I’m facing right now is that there is no central management for our endpoints and nobody seems to care: the general mentality in many respects has remained that of the family business.
 Since the company is constantly growing, now we have more than 250 endpoits to manage without an MDM, and most employees have the possibility to work remotely 2 days a week.
 We have mainly Windows 10-11 PCs, a couple of Macs, a dozen iPads and 70 Android phones.
 Is there a way to manage this all in some MDM with software management? 
 I looked into intune/endpoint manager since we are already using Microsoft 365 services with hybrid Azure AD join.
 I also need to deploy Autodesk apps (such as Autocad and Revit) on 40% of the Windows devices, and I was wondering if there is an MDM that is better suited for this task.
 Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>I’ve got a domain.local that needs syncing with its O365 counterpart. We have around 700 users, each user has an separate account on both domains already, with an identical username.
 My end goal is to get users logging in with a single set of credentials for their computer and o365 logins and allowing automatic login of their OneDrive and Microsoft Office programs. I already know I need to setup password write back.
 I’m looking for best practices and any guides that will help me along the journey of enabling AD sync between this on prem .local domain and our Azure AD counterpart. Of course, I’d like it to go as smoothly as possible.
 Once the domains are synchronised, how does it deal with those users who have different attributes. For example, if a local domain user is showing as in department A, and the O365 user with the same username is in department B, which department wins?

 Oh there is one more details - why can other Windows clients on the network see our old QNAP servers, despite both being in completely different subnets?
 Oh and lastly I know the Windows clients can add them via IP of course. But I&#x27;d rather not do that in-case the IP changes, as well as other reasons like making it easier for people to identify servers.
 Or is there a better way to handle this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m building a Hyper-V lab whereas there are three or more computers:
  
Microsoft Server 2019 - 192.168.5.10 (This will also be the Gateway)
 Windows 11 For Server Access - 192.168.5.20
 Windows 11 for General Client Use (here&#x27;s where &quot;or more&quot; come into play, there may be many clients, all of which should see the same user experience.) - 192.168.5.30
  
I can set up these three in Hyper-V such that they&#x27;ll ping each other, and that I can map a network drive from the Win11 Server Access PC to view the contents on C:\ of the Server 2019. I will be setting up an Internal Switch for this.
 My Client General Use Computers, lets say I wanted to block www.latimes.com (just picking a site, nothing against LA Times), how can I network my computers, such that my Client Computers won&#x27;t be able to access this website?
 The question is not, how do apply the block. I&#x27;ll get to that later.
 Which one of these PCs actually accesses the Internet for that client? Is it #1, #2 or #3? I need that process explained to me and how to network it properly, or at the very least, a link that explains it well for a beginner.
 I am comfortable using Command Prompt, even more comfortable with Powershell (preferred)

 Has one one transitioned from Palo Alto to Cisco Meraki Firewalls? We’re looking at transitioning but I have hesitations. All our sites have Palo Alto devices but we don’t have panorama so no unified or cloud management features. Becomes the brand and cloud management, what are pros vs cons of migrating to Meraki?

                              <span>I have colocation hosting with a provider that I am planning on moving from in the RIPE region.
 For this example lets presume
 My AS &#x3D; AS111
 Current colo AS &#x3D; AS222
 New colo AS &#x3D; AS333
 It&#x27;s been a while I believe all I need to do is update the following from
 import: from AS222 accept ANY export: to AS222 announce AS111 
 To
 import: from AS333 accept ANY export: to AS333 announce AS111 
 Presuming I have the network side setup before making this change in the new data center how long does the change take to propagate globally? And does my previous colo provider need to do anything (such as stop trying to announce)

 We tend to dither in the 5 to 15 users but yeah, looking for best value input. I think we will continue to use Ubiquiti AP plus controller. Everything else is open for discussion
 ​
  
 nice to have POE LAN ports on Router 
 POE manage switch
 Business grade IPS, VLAN, etc
 SNMP obviously

                              <span>Hi,(in hopes that the reddit-elite can help me somehow...)
 Background: For a research project I was asked to try if one could send data with a SFP-Module - slightly disturb the optical channel - and receive whatever (corrupted) data the receiver gets.
 Intermediate goal: Receiving a single (desperated smiley...) package with corrupted data.
 Structure: VirtualBox with Ubuntu 1 → USB2Ethernet → Ethernet2SFP → SFP2Ethernet → Ethernet2USB → VirtualBox with Ubuntu 2.
 (Add1: In reality I have a breakout-board with two additional SFP-Modules in between the SFP2Ethernet-convertes to inspect the transmitted signal with an oscilloscope - but since it does nothing to the data it seems irrelevant for the question)(Add2: The SFP2Ethernet-convertes are from 10Gtek. They use the RealTek RTL8213 IC)

 I&#x27;m not sure if Wildfire belongs in this list. Palo claims &quot;DNS Security&quot; but I haven&#x27;t found a description of what that actually means.

 Here is what we need:
  
Prefer something that&#x27;s cloud based that we can access anytime but not a deal breaker
 
Don&#x27;t want to pay annual fees if we can avoid it 
 
We have two remote sites where we back up to each other, so it needs to be able to handle constant large file transfers without crashing
 
Welcome open source solution. DD-WRT?
 
Enterprise grade
 
Reasonable cost
 
 Any recommendations?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everybody,
 I currently work for a local government outside the US with a relatively small IT department. I am currently the teammember with the longest employment with just 17 months working here. It was (and still is) a wild ride.
 We currently face the challenge, that our core-switches and a lot of our network switches are extremly old. We also have two networks (one for the city government and one for the schools of the city) with different brands of switches that run together on a single core-switch each. The core-switches are not redundant. It&#x27;s a bit of a mess.
 One network is currently running on Nortel and Extreme switches, the other one is mainly Aruba and HP. We also use Aruba for our WIFI.
 Out goal is to replace both core-switches, and make both networks run redundantly over both core-switches (still seperated via VLANs). Also, currently nearly all our routing is done by the core-switches instead of the firewall. We want to change that as well.
 We also have to replace a huge amount of our switches over the next year or two. Here we want to choose one brand for both networks, that we stick with in the future.
 Now I am not very deep into the networking side of things (yet). I am normaly more of a sysadmin. That&#x27;s why I wanted to ask you guys for some recommendations on how to approach this.
 What brands of switch-manifacturers would you recommend? What technologies should I look out for? What should I avoid?

                              <span>My understanding of SASE is that clients install an agent that tunnels up to the SASE provider’s cloud, and routes all outbound traffic via this tunnel, where it goes through the provider’s Firewall in said cloud instance, and then egresses from there. To access on-prem company resources, a light weight connector VM is dropped somewhere in the datacenter that tunnels up to the same SASE provider cloud, and acts as a proxy of sorts.
 In theory this eliminates remote access vpn full tunneling into your network.. remote users no longer get a routable IP that can be reached from on-prem, meaning they also can’t reach on-prem resources unless it’s via the “connector” and that can be locked down according to your heart’s content.. meanwhile all traffic destined outside of your network has the benefit of being secured by this cloud firewall.
 My question is, have any of you transitioned to a solution like this as a full-on replacement to traditional remote access vpn? What was your driver in doing so? (Checking a box for zero trust strategy? Eliminating the overhead of managing the remote access vpn infrastructure? (Patching appliances, renewing certificates, keeping client software version current, etc). Because a case study showed this was genuinely more secure than a traditional remote access vpn?)
 My other question os what are the shortcomings? Issues encountered, etc? I’m already thinking of an interactive app we use in our network that probably won’t work with this, since it establishes old school RTP sessions to endpoints.. so any stateful device sees two different sessions, one from endpoint, one to endpoint… I’m skeptical this will successfully traverse the “connector” proxy..
 Any other thoughts? Is this just another marketing fad and it’s really just over glorified “cloud firewall?” Or is this pretty much the future? Maybe I’m completely missing the point on what SASE actually is and why it is? I’m eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on this!

                              <span>Hello guys, lately I have been having some problems with Ip adresses that trace back to CGNAT networks. My problem is that when I block the supposedly “malicious” Ip’s, many legitimate users are also blocked. I have 2 minutes questions:
  
How are spammers and attackers in a CGNAT network traced or identified?
 
Do the Internet providers of the networks keep track of the traffic from each individual user, or just the traffic that is generated inside the CGNAT network as a whole.
 
 The ISP’s haven’t been really helpful, since most of their helpdesk employees aren’t very tech savvy. Thank you in advance :)

 I observed a strange issue in my POC and it&#x27;s been a bit of a head scratcher for me.
 This is an SDA POC deployment so do keep in mind that there might be some config out of place as we&#x27;ve bene playing with the test scenario. 
 To get a better idea of the issue I&#x27;d need to give a topology however Images are not supported in this reddit so I&#x27;ll try to do my best to explain the scenario: 
 Core network is running OSPF.
 THere are 2 Nexus 9300 acting as fusion router ( standalone) however only SDA-IPN-01 has a link up to CORE network. 
 Fusion devices SDA-IPN-01 and SDA-IPN-02 are connected via P2P link and are forming IBGP connection.
 This IS AS65002 
 On SDA-IPN-01 I&#x27;m redistributing All routes from OSPF to BGP and vice versa . Redistribution from BGP to OSPF has 2 route maps. On…</span>

                              <span>The Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday in the case Groff Vs Dejoy. A Christian postal worker wants to exercise the right to not work on Sundays so that he can observe the sabbath, but the postal service says that accommodation is an undue burden on other staff. The ruling will have broad implications for the rights of religious Americans to observe their faith in the workplace.

                              <span>I have some sysadmins reporting to me who have worked at this place for 20 years, and they are afraid of automation and argue that it isn&#x27;t necessary and will make everything unreliable.
 Short of just firing them and starting over with new people, how would you indoctrinate them? Are there any books or other sources out there that I can use to bring these people in line with modern times? I can&#x27;t spoon feed them everything myself. They have been successfully managing their legacy systems for 20 years, but we need a change, and I would prefer to not have that change involve getting rid of them.
 These are people who have never heard of ansible or rundeck and who cut their teeth on solaris.
 I&#x27;m looking for something like &quot;automation 101&quot; that talks about new methods of doing things and the modern way to manage IT, and has a pets vs cattle discussion.

                              <span>Interviewed and received a job offer for a sysadmin position at a pretty large theme park/resort. Would be working as part of a team, primarily managing and maintaining systems in their data center, managing O365/AzureAD, assisting with escalated tickets, and I&#x27;m sure a ton more.
 I&#x27;m currently an Azure Admin for a large MSP, and have been for a little over 2 years now, this job will require me to move back into an on-premise environment and learn VMWare. I&#x27;m not opposed to this, but just not sure if it would be a step-down, and I certainly would miss Azure. Job is hybrid, 2–3 days a week in office, I&#x27;m currently fully remote. Would be a 15% percent raise.
 Have a slight obsession with theme parks/roller coasters, so I do think this would be a cool position to have, with some opportunity to assist with system and network design for ride operations + the park in general.
 Anyone ever worked IT in the amusement industry? How bad is it?

                              <span>I work for a mid-size corporation. We&#x27;re in the home stretch of implementing a new ERP system consisting of various Windows Server 2019 VMs hosted on a Windows 2019 Hyper-V cluster. The vendor &quot;requires&quot; sub-0.500ms network response times between the component servers (SQL, web front-end, etc). We&#x27;re far exceeding their IOPS specs for disk, so that&#x27;s not a concern whatsoever.
 Am I the only one that feels this network latency requirement is unrealistic? I&#x27;m currently attaining values ~0.700ms, even between VMs on different hosts. I barely get sub-0.500ms response times between 2 Cisco network switches with a 100Gb interconnect.

                              <span>Why does the view behavior change when the column order changes?
 For example, when using conversation view and have &#x27;Subject&#x27; field in the 2nd column, for every item in there the name of the subject is not repeated. However, if subject is in the 3rd column, the subject name is repeated for every item.
  
 Why does it do this and how can I make it so it doesn&#x27;t repeat for every item in the chain?
 Similarly, can I force that behavior (to not repeat) if I&#x27;m using the &#x27;Task Subject&#x27; instead of the normal Subject field?
  
 See screenshot here as an example to better explain this,

 Need a tool that will visualization our network by grabbing our pfsense firewall/NAT rules and generating some sort of visualization.
 I know I can pull the xml configs of the firewall/NAT rules off pfsense but trying to figure out a good tool in order to parse that and visualize it.
 Our ISSO wants to have something in order to review and see which systems have outside connections coming in to them from the internet and over what ports.
 They asked us to look into Redseal, which seems to be capable of doing this but comes with a $60k price tag to it, which is way too high for what little we need it to do.
 We do not need a SIEM, Vuln scanner, CIS/SCAP benchmark tool, SOC analytics or anything else Redseal seems to offer. 
 Anyone have any suggestions? I haven&#x27;t used python before to parse xml and visualize it into something but i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been done before or there&#x27;s something like this...somewhere lol. Just not sure where!

                              <span>Not a sysadmin, but I handle some tickets for a lot of low-level items on the business side. Usually one ticket with many low-level items, i.e. 5 low-level items, one ticket. These low-level items are essentially different workstreams that can be blocked based on another user. Essentially, there are cases where 3 low-level items are cleared, but we still have 2 remaining, so the ticket isn&#x27;t closed on our side. This causes a never-ending build-up. 
 Seeing as this sub probably deals with tickets, I wanted to see if there&#x27;s an efficient way to deal with this. I can&#x27;t play cat and mouse with the users forever, going into each ticket and firing off email reminders to clear their item, so I can clear mine. I also can&#x27;t police the users to only have 1 item per ticket, it&#x27;s not feasible.
 The only thing I can think about to combat this is to track these items at the lowest level in Excel, then automate a weekly reminder via Power Automate. Is this the right approach, something better out there?

                              <span>This is probably just a misunderstanding of mine as to how group policy works, but I can&#x27;t wrap my head why the order of precedence for group policies in our environment is the way it is. Apologies for the shit title.
 We have a group policy for MS Office that is being enforced at the domain level. There are a couple settings in there that I think are currently breaking some things, so I applied a test group policy with the opposite configurations to a test OU where I&#x27;ve placed a few computers. 
 My understanding is that the group policy should apply in the order of local -&gt; site -&gt; domain &gt; OU. So even though I have the test group policy applied at the test OU the computer resides in, when I check inheritance for the test OU, the MS Office policy is taking precedence over my test policy, even after enforcing my test policy. Office policy is like #11 in the list of precedence whereas mine is in the mid 30s. 
 The inheritance seems to have everything at domain/site above the OU policy, which is contrapositive to what I thought I knew about GP. 
 What am I missing?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 My time has finally come to post here! I am seeking advice on how I should approach the following situation:
 Recently, I was offered two separate administration positions. Unfortunately, both of them are solo admins, meaning I would be the only &quot;IT&quot; person on site. This worries me due to my limited experience..
 For some background, I am graduating with a CS degree in less than a month, and have been working at a tier 1 IT helpdesk the past two years, and I feel like I am not ready to move into this admin position because of the lack of guidance.
 I would say I have intermediate knowledge in Networking, scripting, and virtualization topics, but have very beginner level knowledge in administration.
 What should I do??
 ​
 Edit:
 If anyone has some resources for anything administration related, I would be grateful if you shared with me :)
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>For days we&#x27;ve had this issue of folder redirection breaking 10 or so minutes after users logged in. It started with one user, then two, and soon it became a large handful. Multiple engineers were baffled and threw in the towel.
 Today, I sat down and was determined to figure it out. After 4 hours of analysing event logs and intense Googling, I got it; the file server IP and hostname don&#x27;t match in DNS. 
 The previous tech managing this environment before my company took over had no idea what he was doing. Because of this, there are configurations that at best make no sense, and at worst are dangerous. In this case, the file server had a static IP that&#x27;s inside a DHCP range, so a client took over its IP causing the mismatch.
 Releasing the IP, extending the exclusion range and recreating the server&#x27;s A record fixed the issue. I know there are other ways of sorting it, but with the random exclusion ranges already present, this was the safest option.
 It&#x27;s Friday, I&#x27;ve had a long week, and this took the last bit of energy I had, but man do I feel powerful for figuring it out! 
 Just wanted to share this little victory. Have a good weekend guys.

 I’m afraid I know the answer to this but I need to ask just so I can go home for the weekend knowing I asked:
 I’m trying to Install an ARM MSI from GPO (that enough initials for everyone?). When I try to add the MSI I get “Unable to deploy package. The package does not support a Windows compatible platform.” I assume it’s because the server is an x64. I’m trying to deploy settings for some machines running Win11 on M1 Macs in Parallels, and other settings so far are ok. I figured this would be too since the GPO just points the client to the MSI on the network, and it doesn’t actually need to run on the server, but I guess it doesn’t like that it’s an ARM package.
 There’s not some magical checkbox or setting buried somewhere I’m missing to get around this, is there? The x64 version of the same installer works fine.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I have a large task of reaching out to shared mailboxes that are still on prem in the effort to get rid of on prem exchange.
 ​
 I was thinking of doing the following -
 Set up power automate flow:
 Send Email to shared mailbox &quot;hello, we are determining if this mailbox is in use or not, please response yes / no Yes(requires business justification and your name etc)
 ​
 If yes -&gt; log response in sharepoint list
 If no -&gt; log response in sharepoint list, marked for deletion etc
 ​
 ​
 Anyone ever have to do a project like this? Does my line of thinking make sense in terms of automation or is there a better method.
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Last weekend I bought this chair from my local staples (https://www.staples.com/tempur-pedic-mesh-back-fabric-computer-and-desk-chair-black-tp6450-blkmb/product_24401228) it felt wonder if the store compared to my old one.
 I was having some wrist pains, due to my old chairs arm rests not being in line with my desk, and my wrists being at awful angle. New chair fixed my wrist pain, but the lumbar support is awful in it. I sat in the chair, for at least 30 minutes before buying, first 3 days this week where good. However, Thursday and today my lower back is in pain. It’s not even 11AM today, and my lower back hurts already.
 I was hoping to return it, and replace it with something better. I know Herman Millers/Steelcase are expensive, but I need something that’s better supporting.
 In anyone’s experience, are those chairs worth the $$$$$? My biggest ask in another new chair are, adjustable arm rests, good lumbar support, comfortable for all day work.
 Thanks for your recommendations!

                              <span>So as I&#x27;m reading this release/heads-up from MS about them turning on MFA as the security default in our/everyone&#x27;s tenant in a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m a little concerned.
 I fully understand why they are doing it as a default - just the &quot;right&quot; security policy and takes (some) of the liability off of their plate. However, MFA will just simply not work for a lot of our staff. The bulk of our staff don&#x27;t need multifactor to just open their email. Half of them can&#x27;t even have their phones out at their desks due to client requirements nor do they have any ability to access email/system outside of the office itself.
 I&#x27;m by no means a &quot;system admin&quot; (more of a jack of all trades but master of none) but I&#x27;m the version of that in our office. I&#x27;m assuming that I can reverse this new default setting when MS flips the switch so we stay how we currently are set up - those that require remote access have MFA and those that do require remote access do not have MFA.
 Any help/direction you can provide will help settle my nerves. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>So here is the situation, We have users onboarded and are given an iPhone (using Mail app) setup with their Office365 email. 
 We want to be able to move a base list of Contacts to the user&#x27;s phone/Personal Outlook Contacts so that when users text/call it comes up with said employee&#x27;s name.
 What we do currently is during account creation we log in as the user into OWA and just import a CSV of the base list so it populates down to the iPhone when signed into the email.
 Is there a way to better automate this?

                              <span>Hoping someone can help out. We have a couple users who are basically unable to use Adobe due to it crashing every time a document is loaded. If they ARE able to get it to load, it will crash as soon as they try to use a stamp on the document (this is 80% of what they do with Adobe). 
 I&#x27;ve tried about every solution I could find on Google and nothing has worked. Wondering if anyone has ran into this issue and what you did to fix it (besides use a different PDF editor lol).

                              <span>I run a stream of the 90s Weather Channel using a software simulator. It&#x27;s been on an Intel NUC, which has shown its age and is a bit noisy when the fan is going. I figured I&#x27;d upgrade and found a fanless thin client, an HP T620, for cheap. I figured I could just set it in write mode, install the programs I needed, then disable write mode and have it get going. Only issue is that in write mode, it only exposes about 250mb of C: - not enough for OBS and storing music. 
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me find HP documentation on the T620 - everything seems to be a dead link. Is there any guide or documentation that people know of on how I can enable writes to the full 64gb storage capacity? Last time I did this, I was sysadminning a Citrix Xendesktop environment, and I used Citrix&#x27;s console to create image versions as VHDs, cracked them open in Hyper-V, made my changes, and merged them in for the thin clients to boot to the image, but this is at drastically smaller scale and scope.

                              <span>My company has around 18TB of legal hold data we&#x27;ve gathered over the years that we cannot delete yet.
 The data: * Is stored on-site on an older Netapp we want to get rid of * Consists of exported PST&#x27;s, network drive folders, and Windows PC HDD images
 The same senior people tend to get looped into multiple cases, so all of this data duplicates in half down to 9TB on disk with Netapp&#x27;s deduplication.
 We want to move the data off the Netapp and securely store it in the cloud somewhere. The data is very rarely read. I would prefer to be able to keep a copy on site, but we&#x27;d need to purchase some new storage to accommodate for that.
 Any recommendations on inexpensive hardware (not a custom build, needs ~NBD coverage) for storing this data on-site and for services to securely store this data in the cloud?

                              <span>Hey guys 
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to monitor an internal SMTP mail server 
 been trying to do this with a powershell command but its not exactly working as i like
 I was thinking maybe there&#x27;s some type of service or local agent that can install to monitor this
 I basically want to be alerted if the mail flow for a specific account is not working connected to this internal relay 
 the relay is available only internally so I can&#x27;t use an external service to monitor the specific IP and port
 Ideas?
 Thx

                              <span>Hi, has anyone actually tried an in place upgrade of PKI servers to Widows Server 2022? PKI environment is quite new build on 2019 Server Core and well tailored/designed - writing this as many people recommend migration as a good time to redesing - we good here, nothing to redesing. I know that some previous IPUs might not be the best choice but hey - we got 2023 and we are telling about an IPU from 2019 to 2022 not from 2008 to 2012. But maybe I am too optimistic - if yes please roast me.

 Do you believe all the people who become sysadmins were always going to be sysadmins?

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin community!
 I&#x27;d like to share with you a project I&#x27;ve been working on, called NetAtlas C2 Server Search. It&#x27;s a Java-based utility designed to detect Command and Control (C2) servers using the Netlas API. The tool offers a simple and user-friendly CLI interface for searching C2 servers, leveraging the Netlas API to gather data and process it locally.
 ![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/Q0g0ego8SK97elJvTHN5IXLzs.svg)
 To get started, you&#x27;ll need a Netlas API key, which you can obtain from the Netlas website. Once you have your API key, you can use the c2detect command to search for servers:
 bash c2detect -t  -p  -s  [-v] 
 This project is available on GitHub, and you can find the full README file with detailed usage instructions, Docker support, and a list of supported C2 servers there.
 If you&#x27;d like to contribute or have any feedback, please feel free to create a pull request or leave a comment. I hope you find this tool helpful in your sysadmin tasks!
 Happy hunting!

                              <span>Hello,
 we have a lot of devices that are registered several times in azure with the same device/computer name.
 Basically I think that every time someone else logs onto that computers and uses office 365 with their account it&#x27;s creating a new device in Azure...
 I&#x27;m fairly sure that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to be, because it&#x27;s called &quot;device&quot; and not &quot;device/user link&quot;.
 I have found a particular device that&#x27;s 16 times in azure...
 we have more than 1300 &quot;stale devices&quot; because of this.
 Does anyone has any insight of to prevent this and/or why this is happening ?
 ​
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>If a Windows host has multiple RDP certificates. Do all get checked while connecting or only the first found?
 I have a RDP certificates deployed from an Root CA with now invalid OCSP location in the AIA. Connecting to every hosts now takes obviously more to check the invalid OCSP address. I would deploy additional valid RDP certificates, but I am unsure how it handles both certificates. If I am correct, then it won&#x27;t bother to check expired certs.
 But would it check all RDP certs if they are not expired and then of course still complain about the invalid OCSP?
 I would hope that it somehow is satisfied with one completely valid RDP cert.
 With RDP certificate I mean a certificate with enhanced key usage of value &quot;1.3.6.1.4.1.311.54.1.2&quot;

 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to run 2 different Powershell script during my Task sequence. However, during the task sequence it fails after trying to run with 1st script with the warning &quot;Powershell was not detected&quot;
 ​
 The script i located in the Scripts folder of my deployment share, so i use %SCRIPTROOT%\.ps1
 Added the Task under &quot;Postinstall&quot; after &quot;Copy Scripts&quot; with type &quot;Run Powershell script&quot;.
 Am i doing something wrong?

 Is there a policy (InTune/GPO/Registry) which lets me specify this one folder path to always keep downloaded?

                              <span>The cheaper Vostro and Inspiron laptops always were a little shit, and would develop faults after a while, but the Latitude laptops were solid and unbreakable. These days, every model Dell makes seems to be a steaming pile of manure
 We were buying Vostro laptops during the shortages and we&#x27;d send so many back within a few months. Poor quality hinge connection on the lids, keyboard and trackpad issues, audio device failure (happened to at least 10 machines), camera failure, and so on. And even the ones that survived are slowly dying
 But the Latitude machines still seemed to be good. We&#x27;d never sent one back, and the only warranty claim we&#x27;d made was for a failed hard drive many years ago. Fast forward to today and I&#x27;ve now had to have two Latitude laptops repaired, one needed a motherboard replacement before I even had it deployed, and another was deployed for a week before the charger jack mysteriously stopped working
 Utterly useless and terrible quality

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Hi,
 I lately encountered an installer and software that is signed with an Apple certificate. As our windows installation does not trust the root certificate, the application is blocked by applocker.
 I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m missing something. Is this certificate supposed to be trusted on windows computers? Should I add an apple root and intermediate certs to our windows clients? Is this the new normal for application developers to sign their executables with?

                              <span>This might be the single stupidest question i might have ever asked but i do think it would be a cool idea, so i wanted all of your opinions as to why this might be a stupid idea or a (maybe/semi) good idea.
 I was thinking of setting up a locally hosted dashboard that would replace the homepage (which is just set to the company website) where there would be &quot;bookmarks&quot; that takes you to notable items within the company like: ERP login, SharePoint, Office, Homepage, etc.. limitless potential. You could ask yourself why not just have standard bookmarks, but my response to that is; this would be cooler.
 As this would be locally there is the problem that while not connected to the local infrastructure or VPN it would not necessarily work, there might be a way to throw in a failsafe somewhere that just redirects to the homepage or something, i have not thought that far yet.
 So please Tech people of reddit, is this the most idiotic idea you have heard or is it a cool/semi good idea?
 Thanks for your response

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I recently got myself hired as a Junior system engineer and i&#x27;ve honestly been getting a bit of impostor syndrome (not doing much) which made me realise I might aswell just use this time for personal growth.
 ​
 So reddit, what would you use this time for if you were in my situation, getting certs, studying something specific? I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts!
 ​
 (Currently have very-very basic Microsoft fundamental certs Az, MS, Sc, a degree and about a year of helpdesk but that&#x27;s it really)

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to discuss how we are all sharing password with others who don&#x27;t have access to the same password manager to go get it themselves. It can be in chat, email or over the phone with staff we know and maybe people we never met. Privnote.com is what I had been asked to use. Some password managers allow sharing, but the person would need to create a user.
 What are some of the super dooper secure authentication workflows you can dream up?
 For instance, I don&#x27;t know there voice so before I share, I&#x27;ll ask them what the asset tag is on the laptop to make sure there are really in front of it.

 The company I work for under went a restructure (make a load of redundancies and play chess to fill roles that are required but no manpower exists for, leading to a massive workload for everyone).
 An infrastructure engineer was bumped up to IT Team Manager, as well as several duties that the now non-existant Director of IT and Security did as well as QA tasks.
 There is no focus at all on automation, in fact if anything, we are unautomating things due to &quot;cost saving benefit&quot; (man hours does not seem to be a concern). 
 The manager is pushing back against cloud migration (despite it being wanted by the board by a certain date). We have plenty of sy…</span>

 I always wonder how it works with the VSS black magic. I&#x27;m sure someone here can shed some light for me.
 Another example is what if I save a file to the desktop when the backup is 33% 66% and 99%
 Would any of the files be missing from the backup?

I can do some Docker labs on my computer but that&#x27;s about where it ends when it comes to these tools meant for high scalability. Are there any specific courses, websites with sandboxes and directions, etc. that you&#x27;d recommend for picking these up?

                              <span>Newer network engineer in the ISP world.
 I am at a smaller fiber ISP. We are trying to figure out the best way to calculate our network availability/reliability percentage for when subscribers or businesses ask.
 What scope would we use to define our availability? Entire network outages where no subscribers have access? Would we calculate for all nodes then average them?
 We have small outages all the time from fiber damage so would we count every single one of those?
 What should be included or excluded? Any thoughts would be great.

                              <span>Are we the only ones running into this? Several times, and with several different versions, we have been getting our Fortigate firewalls&#x27; virus scanning getting tripped by direct-from-Cisco IOS-XE downloads (specifically, 17.3.7, 17.6.4, and 17.6.5 for various sizes of 9800 WLCs and the 9300 switches) for &quot;W32/MalformedType.PE!dam&quot;. 
 Fortinet insists that this is damaged malware according to their website, but - having pulled it down to a VM and scanned it with several tools and run a checksum on it - is absolutely a match for what Cisco lists for SHA512 checksum and comes back clean.
 I&#x27;m expecting to need to do battle with the InfoSec dragon on Monday, and I&#x27;d like to find out if anyone else is seeing this (or has seen similar in the past). I&#x27;m expecting it&#x27;s a false positive on Fortinet&#x27;s part given nothing else has tripped on scans, but certain individuals on the InfoSec team can be somewhat stubborn, and I can&#x27;t choose who to go to on this one.

I&#x27;m really just interested in the load balancing characteristics - I don&#x27;t need VPN or that jazz.
 Any other recommendations to accomplish what i&#x27;m looking to do without any excessive licensing or needing to stand up a VM? This is just for a single site so I don&#x27;t want to bloat up my infrastructure.

                              <span>I need help,
 I am brand new in IT and got a job as a system admin/IT helpdesk. I am the only one so I need to wear a lot of hats. Recently we got 4 new wireless access points (Aruba ap 505) for the warehouse and I have gotten them theoretically connected to the internet. They are wired and connected to a network switch (Aruba 1930) which is being tethered off another switch. All of the access points are connected to these switches and all 11 that were already here are working perfectly and everything is connected to the same network. I can not get the new access points to connect to the Aruba virtual controller. I add the MAC addresses, a checksum error pops up for a couple seconds then goes away. At this point there are no errors showing but the AP&#x27;s stay red and don&#x27;t seem to connect to the mesh configuration.
 What do I need to do to get these to work?

                              <span>I am currently supporting an office network of about 1500 wireless clients. The hardware for this network is 100% Meraki, MX250 as the firewall, MS425 for core, MS225 for access, and mainly MR46 for wireless. (80 APs over 4 floors)
 Recently we started getting more complains about the WIFI network, and the complaints are always random:
  
It takes too long to connect
 Disconnects often
 Video meetings sometimes hang
  
​
 I will go to the user&#x27;s laptop and everything is working fine. The Meraki logs do not show much helpful information.
 ​
 I took a packet capture on my PC after working hours and I found a very high amount of multicast traffic. The capture was for 22 seconds and 63% of all packets were MDNS from other Mac devices in the network (1600 packets) and this is after working hours.
 ​
 Meraki has an option at the switch level to Enable or Disable &quot;Flood unknown multicast traffic&quot;. Currently, we have it as &quot;enabled&quot; and I am not sure what it could break if I put it in &quot;Disabled&quot;.
 ​
 Are you guys blocking multicast traffic in large WIFI deployments? What is your approach to this?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I have been given the greenlight to start the automation journey for our current organization and go from zero network automation to hero. It is a mix of brownfield for our current devices and any future deployments can be considered greenfield.
 There is a TON of resources out there on how to use all of the network automation tools/frameworks but not much information on common pitfalls and how to properly scale the network automation operation so it doesn&#x27;t blow up in your face.
 So my question to folks who have been down this journey.
  
Can you describe your current workflow?
 What does the lifecycle of provisioning a brand new device look like ?
 How do you handle network changes such as adding a new VLAN to a switch and keeping the source of truth/variables updated with this information?
 Are you constantly polling the device and comparing it to the intended state? How are you handling a mismatch from the intended vs what is on the device ?
 Are you pushing changes made in the source of truth to the device in your workflow?
 How are you handling multiple sources of truth ? 
  
I&#x27;m aware this is really dependent on the tools/skills available to the organization, hoping to get some inspiration and ideas how other orgs are doing their automation.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have two buildings around 300ft apart and have 2 separate systems that need connectivity between the buildings.
 Each of the 2 systems is provided by a different vendor. They each have provided a pre-configured router that gets installed at building A, and each have provided a pre-configured WiFi AP that gets installed at building B. Each vendor has also supplied gear for a point-to-point WiFi bridge.
 I can’t avoid having the 2 routers or the 2 WiFi AP’s due to the preconfigured nature, but is there a way I can avoid having the 2 point-to-point links and use a single point to point link instead?
 I’m thinking I would need a managed switch at each end, setup VLANs, and connect the point-to-point equipment to a trunk port on the switches.
 Open to suggestions!

                              <span>Anyone having trouble authenticating through wired connections with Eduroam in MacOS Ventura? Seems like every now and then, the auth certificate will fail. It shows connected but every site I visit is says “Your Connection is Not Private” error. I&#x27;ve tried everything I could think off but still have problems. Any clues?

                              <span>While I&#x27;m a seasoned unix and network administrator with 30 years experience, I&#x27;m not into global internetworking and I don&#x27;t really want to be, normally I don&#x27;t care what happens after the default route my ISP gives me, but I now suddenly have to and the more I read about BGP, ASNs etc, the more confused I am, so please bear with me ;)
 We are a relatively small company whose managed hoster of 15 years just terminated the contract (&quot;We no longer fit into their business model&quot;, I guess they couldn&#x27;t bullshit enough money out of us, but anyway, irrelevant...) , so now I have ended up with a bunch of IP ranges (smaller than /24, so I can&#x27;t take them with me) entered into dozens of firewalls either as ACLs or as IPSec VPN endpoints, that I now have to change, and all of which are in big enterprises where changes take weeks, if not months to push through the middle management layer.
 OK, I&#x27;ll have to go through all the pain and renumber once, but how do I prevent not to have to do it again if or when similar thing happens again? The scenario would be that when moving between hosters, I would duplicate the environment (i.e. firewalls) and then just flip the route announcements and the traffic switches within minutes and If I did everything correctly I do not have to do anything on the customer side. How realistic is this expectation?
 Do I need an ASN to fully own an IP range? In RIPE requirements (we are in the EU) it says you have to be multihomed to get one, but we are nothing yet as we haven&#x27;t picked the new hoster yet ;) Or am I doing things in the wrong order, first I have to pick a hoster and then get the range. What do I have to ask the potential hosting candidates to be sure the plan is going to work? How does one own an IP range, is it tied to a person, organization, ASN? How does one move it around between hosters?

                              <span>Hi all, can you recommend some Youtube (or similar) channels where two or more people chatting casually about networking topics? I&#x27;ve been studying for a certificate recently but I want to listen something on networking sometimes, in a more relaxed manner in my free times, maybe while eating or driving/commuting.
 My suggestion would be Packet Pushers. Kindly waiting yours.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I am trying to find a break in an Ethernet cable in an old building. Tried using toner to no avail. 
 Is there a scanner that tell you the approximate distance to the break ? It’s a single wire break on T568A…the orange wire doesn’t make to the main panel. Replaced ends and all. 
 I’ve looked at TDR scanners but would like a recommendation of one that can give you the approximate distance of the break ?

I&#x27;d like to assign anyone WITH a known MAC address to VLAN AA and anyone withOUT a known MAC address to VLAN BB. I&#x27;ve had good success setting up Radius in the the past based off of NAS ID values - routing VLANs - etc. But for the life of me I cannot see where or how to add a list of MAC addresses to an allowlist... any guides available? Google and ChatGPT are failing me.

                              <span>We have a fleet of Dell WD19TB docks with the USB-C cable connectors and there are more than a few that the plastic casing has split (through repetitious plugging/unplugging) and won&#x27;t click back together. I just need something simple to hold them together for regular use and tiny, thick (wide) rubber bands come to mind but I can&#x27;t seem to phrase what I&#x27;m looking for quite right for the googles to assist me. Insights are appreciated.
 Edit: To clarify, we’re a single device laptop shop so staff plug and unplug several times a week as they take laptops home or bring them onsite (we’re hybrid). Ideally the solution would be somewhat aesthetically pleasing but effective.

                              <span>We are a growing healthcare company, recently expanding from 200 users to 350 users in the past couple of years. Up until now we have had a small IT department consisting of four techs who share all responsibilities, from help desk to equipment installs to device configurations to facilities work and vendor support.
 It has been increasingly difficult to manage projects and maintain our infrastructure due to how many hats we wear, the lack of staffing, and the constant interruptions of day to day issues. This has led to us experiencing a cyber attack and the loss of two of our staff due to burnout and the inability to keep up. 
 The company has managed to bounce back, but I am not seeing any signs of slowing down and we are still meagerly staffed and I can sense another implosion on the horizon. 
 But I’m getting too far ahead of myself. I guess my main question is - how do we structure our IT department as a growing company to assure we are staffed and handling issues correctly? I know we are going to need dedicated help desk staff, network technician, security officer, applications support, a manager, a sys admin, etc. - but what are the actual standards for a company from 300-500 employees? Is four IT staff enough? And what roles should they be divided into?
 I feel we are not organized and divided and staffed correctly, and since our current IT manager has zero IT knowledge, I want to see if I can gather some ideas to float up to higher management to get us the help we need before something major happens again due to lack of coverage/support and high burnout.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ll start out by noting that I&#x27;ve been in IT for 5+ years and MSP for 2+. I use a great stack of tools at work (CW, ITG, Ninja, Addigy, Splashtop, Liongard, Auvik) and would like to find alternatives for home use. 
 I use RealVNC for remote access to computers around the house. It&#x27;s free and works great.
 The two I would like to use the most at home is Auvik (network discovery, mapping, and built-in console/ssh) and ITGlue (device documention). I currently use nothing similar to Auvik and a simple Excel spreadsheet for device models, serial numbers, warranties, and similar.
 I&#x27;m considering using AssetTiger for documenting devices, but curious if there&#x27;s anything else out there that would work better. I&#x27;m ok with self hosted as well!

 ​
  
Listing says full remote or hybrid, interviewers are obviously working from home, after the job offer is made they let you know you&#x27;ll be in the office full time alone. Maybe they couldn&#x27;t get their existing staff to come back in, but they&#x27;re hoping new staff will?
 Weird total compensation calculation. For example, total comp is 150k: base salary 50k, 100k bonus. This is mostly in the financial industry which is somewhat known for weird bonus structures but this is nuts, how are they attracting people in a high COLA that don&#x27;t have a huge res…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Tl;Dr what is your time management strategy?
 I&#x27;m a recent sysadmin supervisor after over a decade in service desk management plus a year as a sysad, and I&#x27;m struggling to juggle everything that needs to get done. I&#x27;m hoping to get some sage advice. 
 I am working for a company that had a 3-man IT department two years ago but experienced rapid growth and are now up to 15 IT folks for 200 end users. There&#x27;s a lot that needs to get done. We&#x27;re taking this place from a ma and pa shop to an enterprise-level IT environment from the ground up, and need to do it quickly due to auditing requirements. 
 I&#x27;ve been working 12+ hour days every day without a break other than rushing to the restroom, and it&#x27;s still not enough. My calendar is booked in 15 minute increments for 2-3 weeks out at all times, with more being dropped on my lap every day. My two sysads are junior-level and struggle with most items, so I have to dedicate at least an hour every day to get them in a position to tackle their responsibilities.
 I average 6 meetings a day (my team, my boss, other IT departments, project managers, and vendors), plus project work, ticket escalations, emergency vulnerabilities, and any other random stuff that pops up. I&#x27;m stressed. My team is stressed. They keep threatening to quit and so I spend my lunch break every day helping them organize and prioritize and try to make sure they have everything they need. 
 I started meeting every 2 weeks with the CTO and my boss to adjust priorities as needed, but it has only helped me to meet due dates rather than be chronically late. He says that they don&#x27;t have the budget to hire another sysad right now. 
 Finding another job isn&#x27;t an option - I tried, and after applying to nearly 100 jobs I only received two offers for 20k less than I&#x27;m making now.
 Please help me. I&#x27;m at the end of my rope here. How do you do it? What&#x27;s the secret?

                              <span>Anyone know of a way to trigger the Microsoft Store in Windows 10to check for and update store apps? Especially when nobody is logged into the device? The Store seems to update when apps are in-use (or at least Windows is in use), but some computers go a long time before somebody uses them, but we&#x27;d still like to go ahead and have those apps get their updates. Can this be scheduled? or controlled via a GPO? We&#x27;ve already enabled &quot;automatic updates&quot; in the store via GPO but that isn&#x27;t enough for all computers regardless of usage.

                              <span>So, I was setting up new CNAME DNS records and made a cleanup of old ones that I don&#x27;t need anymore, suddenly every record stopped resolving. What am I doing wrong?
 It looks like that (I don&#x27;t really care in showing the values)Cloudflare DNS dashboardPic of DNS propagation checker
 And my nameservers are set up correctly, pointing to the domains that Cloudflare gave me
 Did I fucked something up when deleting the records? If so, I can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s wrong.
 Sorry for asking for help, but really IDK where else to ask for something like this
 And no, I am not hosting any kind of prohibited content, it&#x27;s just CNAMEs pointing to docs of some projects of mine and for a few web apps (with API)
 EDIT: FIXED IT!!
 I had a loop in SSL redirects, like the browser requests in HTTPS to Cloudflare, Cloudflare turns into HTTP and forwards the request to my hosting, the hosting tries to force HTTPS by redirecting back to HTTPS and so the loops continues. I just had to go into SSL/TLS (on the Cloudflare panel) and change from Flexible to Full.
 This loop probably was crashing the websites that track propagation

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a software dev on getting some things setup, and I get an email from him that my emails are too confrontational, and aggressive. Those weren&#x27;t his words, but that&#x27;s the jist of it.
 Turns out, he doesn&#x27;t like how I take his emails, which are usually shotgun brain dumps with a bunch of different points, questions, ect all mixed together, and split them up into individual points, and denote my responses to each point in red.
 I guess red is too aggressive of a color.
 I&#x27;m sorry. I work in an industry where clear communication is vital. I really don&#x27;t care how colors make you feel.

 We have a user who gets this message: &quot;We cannot render a new actionable message right now. Please close an existing one in Microsoft Outlook and retry.&quot;
 When I search what an actionable message is, it shows an accept or decline type of email or mail that have those type of interactive actions. But my co-worker says she didn&#x27;t engage with any email like that, so I&#x27;m not sure where the issue lies.
 I have already tried to rebuild OST, and make a new outlook profile but the problem persists.
 Is there any way to stop this message?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Switch refresh time - boss man wants to look at Meraki since all of our wireless will be meraki soon. Guess I&#x27;m just used to managing a whole bunch of switches the old fashioned way with CLI and other 3rd party tools.
 Some say it will make my life easier. Some old hardcore guys say they would never put meraki in their org&#x27;s...
 At my age I&#x27;m kind of looking for more &quot;easy buttons&quot;. If we arent &quot;losing&quot; anything, and the proposal is the same price or a little cheaper than traditional networking, why fight it?

                              <span>We had worked out a Meraki outfitting plan, nixed at the time, and time to revisit it again. HQ+5 branches+ possibly a few satellite offices for site-to-site VPN and advanced security/firewall subscription and wi-fi. We like that once the main device is configured, plug and play the others basically, and the sub means someone else is actively maintaining some filtering in reaction to evolving threats. 
 What kind of delay can we expect when ordering Meraki these days ? 
 What other systems should we consider and why ? 
 Oh, also would like recommendations of a couple of VARs to quote/scrutinize and possibly configure

                              <span>For some background, we currently have to ADs as we are migrating. I will explain more later 
 I have a continuing issue with two users with office and using an application called Aria that work with office
 The ticket came in saying Aria had an error “command is not available” when trying to open a document. When opening office it says the license is inactive up at the top for both users. However for one of them when I had them try to sign in again they get a tpm error. (He has not been in the office so have not done any more troubleshooting with him)
 For the user who wasn’t getting tpm error here’s what I tried -removed account in school/work account setting He was then able to get into office fine. When opening up aria though he was able to open a document, then it would ask for his office email, he entered it, the it would freeze. 
 Now, I am not very familiar with Aria (though I believe this is a problem with office) but sometimes if we have a user log back in in our old domain then open Aria and then log back in our new domain Aria works. (It has to populate in the old domain). I go to do that and I get the same license issue with office(no tpm error) try removing account in school/work account setting, still doesn’t work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, removed local file in app date and the launched again. Still nothing. 
 Last couple of things -version of office is 16.016130.20394 -both users work fine and have no issues on other PCs + verified they have valid licenses. 
 I’ve asked everyone on my team, endless googling and have gotten nowhere. User is getting frustrated so this is my last shot. 
 I’m a new help desk tech so please go easy on me if I’m missing something really dumb. Thanks in advanced for any help

 Our printers are managed by Windows 2019 print server.

                              <span>Asking here because I&#x27;m hitting a wall-
 I recently deployed this Teams Device as well as a companion touch screen to one of my clients, and after a few hiccups getting the Teams/Zoom firmware working correctly and getting the touchscreen properly paired it seemed to be a pretty nice solution in their conference room.
 Unfortunately, despite my testing without issue one of their primary users is finding the camera in the bar locks up when presenting a PP via her laptop while in a meeting.
 I have not been able to reproduce it myself, and do not have easy access to get hands-on as often as I&#x27;d like to.
 Has anyone come across any issues like this with a Yealink device? When the issue occurs it necessitates a complete hard reset of the device. 
 I&#x27;m already also working with their support, but they&#x27;re China based and the time between updates is tedious.
 The firmware on both devices is latest and the Teams app has been recently updated.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Im pretty new into IT and setting up a WPA2 Enterprise WLAN in our company,
 CA, NPS is already there and working, the Certifiactes are already on the clients 
 The Problem is if i set up the WLC as a Radius Client, and try to connect to the WiFi 
 the NPS says the Access Point im connecting to is a invalid Radius Client,
 if i set up the Access Point as a Radius Client, and turn the WLC off in the NPS it works complety fine.
 ​
 The Controller is a unifi controller, i configured a nps profile with ip address and shared secret so it should work.
 ​
 Do you guys have any ideas what im doing wrong?

 Relying on procedure and sending out user communication to restart?
 Scripting a message to users and/or killing the chrome process if they do not comply?

 As per the documentation provided Here it should not display any prompts for users if I use the switch displaylevel&#x3D;false. 
 The command line is currently working as expected for users who have not yet received the latest update of M365 Apps, 
 But users who have already been updated are receiving a pop-up message that says &quot;You&#x27;re up to date! The latest version of Microsoft 365 and Office are Installed on your computer.&quot;
 Is there any way I can suppress that You&#x27;re up to date! message on the computers where latest version is already installed!!

                              <span>Good morning all,
 Not sure if this will stay up, but I wanted to ask how you guys deal with having a boss who knows absolutely nothing about IT, and yet makes all of the decisions regarding IT.
 Some background: I work for a small municipal government as 1 of 2 IT techs. We fall under the Finance dept, so the Finance Director (FD) is our boss, and fills the role of IT Director. He knows nothing about IT, and looks at every issue through &quot;cost-goggles&quot; ie. what is the cheapest option and go with that.
 He also doesn&#x27;t trust either myself or the other IT guy when we tell him information about our systems and what they need. He&#x27;s extremely micromanaging, to the point that if we change the way the weekly update email is worded, we need to have three meetings with him before we can make the change.
 This is turning more into a rant than a question, but what would you guys recommend we do? I&#x27;d love to go to the city manager and say that we need an actual IT Director, but he likely wont listen, and also tell the FD about it, which will make our lives hell. I also can&#x27;t go to HR, because the HR dept also falls under the FD.
 Any advice is much appreciated, thanks for your time, and have a wonderful Thursday!

                              <span>So OEMs use OS images they copy to laptop hard drives when they&#x27;re assembled right?
 Dell, HP, they all do this. 
 In our experience here, 1 out of 10 of these laptops has problems with that image. So in the past, what we&#x27;ve done is just take any new machines we purchase, format the drives and do a fresh install of the OS with drivers. Then give it to the user.
 However, as we&#x27;re growing, we&#x27;re starting to get users in other countries. And it&#x27;s impractical to order a laptop, (for example) from India, so it complies with export regulations. Ship it here. Format it, and ship it to the user.

 Logging into two different tenants this morning and seeing the following message:
 New to Microsoft 365?
 This is your Microsoft 365 home page—where you can see and access all of your apps. If it&#x27;s empty, it could be that your user license was very recently assigned to you. Wait 10 minutes and refresh this page. If you still don&#x27;t see any apps, contact your IT department. They can help you get up and running. 
 ​
 No apps are appearing. Anyone else?

                              <span>So, the company I work for wants to digitize all incoming invoices. 
 Here&#x27;s how it was done before: people would print out the invoice, check if all entries are correct, put a stamp on it, and only then would it get scanned. 
 However, now the entire printing process will be eliminated. 
 Because of this, I have been looking for some software (preferably free, of course) that would help with this task. 
 For now, I have only thought of using a PDF editor and putting a &quot;stamps&quot; on it. But maybe there are some better options, so If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them.

                              <span>Hello there!
 I have more than 211k updates in WSUS console, and I&#x27;m wondering if I should leave it or not...
 What&#x27;s the best practice regarding superseded updates? Should I decline them to clean my console up? Does it make console faster?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I installed LAPS on a domain controller, I updated the AD scheme with update-AdmPwdADSchema, set password read permissions for domain admins, set the computer self permission to the testservers ou
 I created a gpo to push the laps installer to target server, and configured the group policy to have certain password requirements. I ran a gpresult on target server and confirmed it has the policy applied
 I ran a load of gpupdate /force, reboots on target server, changed the password expiry to instantly expire, but no password is being applied.
 ​
 the LAPS UI shows a blank password, but the expires field shows as expected. This is the same for the LAPS tab in active directory for the server, aswell as the new attributes that were added for each object

                              <span>Hello, 
 maybe someone here can help me with our DNS configuration. I have an issue where the DNS entries for our Windows clients are incorrect. Specifically, the DNS entry is showing the IP address of the WiFi NIC of the client 90% of the time, even though the client is connected via cable. 
 The cause is likely that the clients are connecting to the network through a USB-C dock, and the WiFi connection is being established faster and therefore getting registered with DNS. But shouldn&#x27;t the DHCP or the client automatically update the entry?

 With an attachment to the HTML, unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t paying full attention and had already downloaded the html, but I never run it. Then immediately I deleted it again and then I downloaded it again but opened it in vscode and saw code that is fully obfuscated:
 var _0x297387&#x3D;[&#x27;\x77\x61\x72\x6e&#x27;,&#x27;\x33\x32\x34\x37\x35\x38\x42\x5a\x50\x52\x59\x7a&#x27;,&#x27;\x31\x38\x4d\x44\x4a\x4d\x74\x54&#x27;] ...etc..
 If I try to use https://deobfuscate.io/, I get the following: var jamire &#x3D; [&quot;warn&quot;, &quot;324758BZPRYz&quot;, &quot;18MDJMtT&quot;]; so they were probably building some webpage using this obfuscated array.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m writing it here to warn others + because I also saw this: 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/x8yb5k/is_alyce_a_legitimite_service/
 which was under this subreddit.

                              <span>Heres the scenario , small team of 4. I&#x27;m on the helpdesk working under the helpdesk lead. Above us is Admin 1 and Admin 2.
 Sysadmin 2 died at my workplace.
 So admin 1 spend a bunch of money to outsources a lot of the security, networking and other maintenance and then tries to spread his projects to me on the helpdesk.
 I really don&#x27;t want to absorb his projects without compensation and my boss knows this as I explained this to him but he tried to play it off like these projects are easy and don&#x27;t take much to do and id be getting resume material. Some of them are manageable , as I absorbed handling the security training for our ~400 staff, all aging and in need of basic security knowledge. This alone seems like something worth compensating me for. There are more projects he wants me to do which feels like work i really need to be paid more to do. It requires coordinating with the vendors, purchasing software modules (so far we needed to spend like 12k on software modules for this project....), its expanding our systems capabilities, to me it is really a big project that I basically don&#x27;t want to do. How do i navigate this fairly? Or what is to be expected here in other workplaces?
 Edit: thank you all for some perspective, my team and i have a good relationship overall. Id be very surprised if they wanted to get rid of me (especially after 1 staff member dying) so i think the best course of action is to rough it out with the project and hopefully secure a promotion in the future.

 I checked and there has been no policy changes in the global policy / or any others. 
 Bit confused as to why this happened, I have never seen it before. Does it have to do with that &quot;Follow Office Preview&quot; setting that Microsoft enabled by default?

                              <span>I have a 365 hybrid with 2026 on-prem and all mailboxes in 365.
 People leave I disable their accounts then I want to reclaim the 365 licenses and convert their mailboxes to shared.
 I&#x27;m not 100% clear on the exact process I should follow.
 I think it is:
  
&quot;set-remotemailbox &quot;user&quot; -type shared&quot; on the on-prem Exchange
 wait
 once the mailbox shows in 365 as shared remove the 365 licenses
  
But it seems the mailboxes in 365 don&#x27;t always show as shared as it&#x27;s been over an hour now and one still shows as user.
 I&#x27;m a bit confused whether I need to do any of the steps here?

 At this point we are considering if we want to do so, or look around for a good alternative.
 We use it to support clients using a download link to a customized quick support on our site, by our helpdesk and support engineers. 50ish users. Important is that its reliable and secure. Taking over control, and transfering files is most used.
 What would you suggest?

                              <span>Hi!, so, since my last post asking about GPO&#x27;s, i&#x27;ve managed to create my own test OU at my work place and created a copy of the existing firewall policy so it doesn&#x27;t affect any changes I do.
 I&#x27;ve googled every possible thing that could be added or configured to be blocking the casting to smart tvs from work domain joined laptops.
 I&#x27;ve checked what polices are inside the security settings, specifically for Wireless network (IEEE 802.3) and it is completely empty.
 I&#x27;ve tried opening the TCP and UDP ports that potentially allows Miracast to function.
 I&#x27;m still unsure if Miracast is the same thing as just &quot;Cast&quot; feature to any smart device, e.g smart tvs.
 Would love if anyone has an idea what other parts of the firewall Policy to check if it has something I can disable to allow casting?
 Thanks
 P.S* I&#x27;m new to the company with far more responsibility than my previous role and looking after the entire business on my own with not much guidance lol.

                              <span>For some reason I have inherited a server in a branch that is actually a RODC. I have uninstalled all domain services from the server but it still appears in active directory as a &quot;Read-only, GC&quot;.
 It&#x27;s ancient but it is still used as a print server so I need to somehow convert it from a domain controller to a computer and move it into my server OU.
 I could run metadata cleanup (remove selected server HOSTNAME) but will this totally disconnect it from the domain? I do have a local account but I don&#x27;t want to lose access to it if it drops off the domain network.
 Edit: looks like it hasn&#x27;t actually remove the domain services role when I uninstalled it. Attempting again.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a two part question which feels a bit silly but I&#x27;m not sure why things have been done this way.
 Microsoft Certificate Authority server has been configured but the web enrolment feature has not been added. Is there any reason why someone would not add this - a potential security risk perhaps? 
 The second question, how do I sign a custom certificate request without the web enrolment? I need a certificate with a specific dns name and also another alternative name, in the past Id create a csr and then sign it using the web enrolment 
 Because everything in my org is now hyper security paranoid I need to say whether having the web enrolment on is a risk and if it is I&#x27;ve no idea how to sign a certificate with custom names (this is all internal)
 Sorry for the clumsy question.
 H

I tried using a GPO to silently enable, move, and sync, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work, possibly due to our use of a third-party MFA portal on 365 products. I am open to alternatives, even if they involve manually running a script on each user&#x27;s laptop. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. all users are connected to a domain , i have remote access to everyone, so other than manually clicking on one drive and enabling the sync what other ways can i get through with this task.
 Thanks in advance

 I have to setup two new Linux servers for a new web-application. One should be for production environment and one for development and testing.
 I would start to setup the development environment, because for sure I will figure out that I need additional packages during development.
 But is there a method or a tool that helps me to setup the production server later exactly same like the dev-server? I mean same packages and so on?
 What is the best practice to handle server setup stuff?

                              <span>Based on my past experience, Im leaning towards RAID 10. However, I have never implemented it with 12 drives, each with a capacity of 2TB, and I require close to 10TB of usable storage. 
 As this is a production machine with no cold spare drives, my inclination is to use 10 of the drives with RAID 10, which would provide roughly 10TB of usable storage, faster rebuild times, and the ability to tolerate the loss of 1 drive per RAID with a total loss of 2 drives. 
 Additionally, If have two spare drives available to replace any faulty ones due to only using 10 drives in the raid. Alternatively, I could opt for RAID 60, which would offer more usable space and still allow for the loss of 1 drive per RAID, but would result in slower rebuild times.
 What is peoples experience in this ?

 We have an ERP system and Users need to be able to WFH - Users &amp; Management dont want to use a whole RemoteSession / VDI. They just want the remote App like a normal App in their system. 
 They need to drag and drop Emails from Outlook, Pictures, Files in General directly into the remote App.
 Is there even a way for this to work? To drag and drop from local programs to a Remote App? :/

                              <span>I have a client with a domain controller running on Windows Server 2016. This system was initially upgraded from an old SBS server which got obviously split into a DC and an Exchange Server. While this worked, it still got us stuck with some old domain scheme (I think it’s 2012 now), some old GPOs, settings and more. After a couple of years we’ve moved them to 365 using a hybrid solution for exchange and azure adconnect syncing the computers and users. 
 We’re now planning on replacing the local physical servers as they’re pretty old and thought about taking the opportunity to replace the DC server with a fresh DC Windows Server 2023, and ditch the old exchange server (which is basically turned off for quite some time now, but not removed). This will finally give us a clean environment with a updated domain schema, no old exchange servers.
 ​
 My biggest concerns are:
  
Keeping the users, data and configurations on O365 and connect it to the new environment.
 
Connecting the rest of the current servers to the new environment.
 
We’re also using Intune so would be nice to keep that working.
 
Keeping the domain name on O365 and local DC.
 
Making the whole transition as smooth as possible.
 
 ​
 Would appreciate any tips and ideas on how to approach this project, I&#x27;m sure some of you had to go through something similar. Thanks!

                              <span>I inherited an environment with a strange Time Service configuration in the domain. Currently, there is a group policy, setting the NtpServer to 0.europe.pool.ntp.org for all clients, servers and domain controllers.
 How can I undo this setting, to have all domain members go back to sync time from the domain controller holding the PDC role?

                              <span>Hello, I am attempting to establish a VPN connection with a third party. We have exchanged relevant phase 1 and phase 2 information as well as host information. The cut sheet has no tunnel IPs but when I asked I was referred to the cut sheet. I assumed this meant that I am to use an IP in a provided /28. 
 I went ahead with the configuration, created the requisite proposal, policy, keyring, profiles (one for ikev2, one for ipsec), and transform-set. I also configured a tunnel interface and assigned an IP and the aforementioned range. That didn&#x27;t work so I tried the next, then another, and another. No luck.
 So I asked for a meeting with the third party. Expressed my concern about not having an IP address to assign to the tunnel, it was met with &quot;well your NAT IPs....&quot; and he lost me. 
 I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my ignorance or his, but I don&#x27;t know what to ask or Google at this point. I have read several configuration guides, all referencing an IP assigned to the tunnel. I opened a TAC case and reviewed my configuration with the engineer, their determination, you need an IP assigned to the tunnel. 
 My question for the group, have you ever seen a configuration like this?

 Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.10 - Configure AnyConnect VPN [Cisco Secure Client (including AnyConnect)] - Cisco 
 What UI would the AD domain user use to authenticate to the VPN for the first time prior to sign-in to Windows on a laptop if they didn&#x27;t have Windows cached credentials?

                              <span>Is there a way to change the TFTP block size on Dell S-Series switches? I can’t seem to find anything online about it. Currently trying to do upgrades on a pair and my transfer won’t go over 100kbps. About to pull the plug and just do it on site if I can’t try changing the block size.
 Thanks!

                              <span>What&#x27;s up, y&#x27;all?
 We&#x27;re moving from on-prem server room to DC colo. We have a modest video distribution business with respectable storage and connectivity needs. Part of this move is scaling up, including storage, transcoding capacity and (tada) connectivity.
 We have a legacy FC network connected to a legacy SAN. The rest of the LAN runs on 1GbE. The LAN is upgraded to 25/100G.
 Our internet connectivity has been 1Gbps and we&#x27;ve been saturating it regularly. Looking to move up to 10Gbps in the colo. We average about 50TB of traffic in/out with our current firewall and connectivity. We won&#x27;t have many users on this new network, primarily receiving file-based video, processing, and sending file-based deliverables out to endpoints.
 We&#x27;re upgrading our entire networking stack with a life of at least 5 years before revisiting.
 Our new network build is:
  
Supermicro NAS with Mellanox Connectx-5 2x 100G ports
 Supermicro Top of Rack Switch with 48 x 25G SFP28 and 6 x 100G QSFP28
 Mellanox 25G x 2 cards on the transcoders, workstations, and distribution server back to the switch
  
The LAN side is pretty much done, but we&#x27;re looking for firewall options that will offer at least 10G on the LAN to come up from our core switch and 10G on the WAN to fully utilize contracted bandwidth.
 We&#x27;ve considered building out our own box, but prefer to have an appliance with commercial support.
 We&#x27;ve looked at products from these vendors:
  
FortiNet (100F)
 Ubiquiti
 Netgate
 Mikrotik
  
These vendors seem to offer solutions within our budget (medium enterprise with good feature sets). Would appreciate some firewall recommendations from these vendors, to compare with what we&#x27;ve evaluated, and any others that we may not be considering that would fit.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’ve got several devices that are only able to use ethernet, and they are in pesky locations that would be impractical to try to run ethernet cabling. However, we have a very strong wireless Netwerk throughout this property and I’d like to use Wi-Fi for this. I’m finding several consumer type devices that can bridge. The Wi-Fi connection over to ethernet, but I’m not seeing any Enterprise or more business class devices. The consumer devices I’m finding are more wireless repeaters with an ethernet port built-in, and I definitely don’t want any wireless repeaters on my network. Is anyone else aware of a product that can help with this?

                              <span>Network traffic security Traffic goes from the gateway to Azure Relay to the Power BI backend cluster. This traffic doesn&#x27;t traverse the public internet. All Azure internal traffic goes over the Azure backbone.
 Context: So we have an on premises DB which we are going to connect to Power BI cloud service. The connection is going to be established by placing MS on-premises data gateway app on a Windows server on our network. The on premises data gateway app will establish an outbound connection via 443 with Azure relay which further connects to Power BI cloud service. The above statement is from their doc. It is essentially mentioned that the traffic will not traverse public internet. But how could that be possible? Because Azure relay is in in an Azure region and on premises data gateway is in our DC. Wouldn’t the traffic between them go through the internet via 443? Are they mentioning that Azure internal traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet and makes use of Azure backbone? I’m really having a hard time wrapping my head around this. Can someone please explain the traffic flow in this scenario. I’ll be highly indebted to you for explaining this. I do however understand that traffic will be encrypted from gateway to Azure relay but will it be over the internet? Or how does it work. They say this traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet. But relay is in azure and gateway is in our network :(
 Below is the doc link:

 I am in the process of replacing about 30 Cisco routers that are EoL with newer routers. When I ssh to them and do a show run, some of these routers do not have IP domain-name (domain) in the config, but ssh is still working. IoS versions vary. Is there a command that disables a domain-name from having to be configured prior to generating the rsa keys using the crypto key generate rsa modulus command?

                              <span>We ordered 2x Aruba 6400 chassis like 15 months ago. One was delivered early 2022 so we have 1x Aruba 6405 V1 chassis. 
 Since receiving that chassis, Aruba has discontinued the V1 chassis and cancelled the outstanding items in our order. 
 They are suggesting we order a 6405 v2 chassis to vsf pair with the first chassis.
 Has anyone built a VSF stack of 6405 or 6410 chassis with 1x V1 chassis and 1x v2 chassis? Has anyone tried/tested ISSU with this configuration?
 I feel like this is too guinea pig of a scenario to want to put into production. Having a mix of different chassis versions in a VSF cluster seems like I&#x27;m asking to be bug-testing for the duration of this lifecycle.

                              <span>So I have a branch office that has two uplinks to the internet, actualy three... but the third is to small in bandwidth to be worth the effort. First uplink ORANGE 1gbps commited anywere. Seccond uplink RDS 100mbps commited anywere, up to 1gbps in ISPs peers.
 With BGP it would have been a matter of minutes to get everything up and running. However BGP is not an option for multiple reasons.
 Router is plain debian linux virtualized, can be swapped for anything else software wise, only function is outbound NAT, ipv4 only.
 First idea I had was to scrape the RIPE database for route objects and AS-SET and use those routes, with a depth limit depending on my personal opinions 🤦‍♂️ However I quickly came to discover that in some cases even thow ISP A lists B as peer it may not be the case. Thi…</span>

                              <span>Hey all, I have some older 2520G (J9299A) switches that I would like to use in less critical parts of our network. The one hold up is that the wed interface still requires Java and is totally unusable. SSH is fine, but would like the web interface to be accessible as well.
 The switches are currently running a variant of the 14.XX firmware. From what I’ve seen on the Aruba downloads site, there is a 15.XX firmware available for these switches, and it specifically lists the J9299A model as supported in the firmware notes.
 I’m trying to update the switch with this firmware via XMODEM through the console port, but that’s not working like it has on other switches.
 Is there a better way that I should be doing this? Or is there not newer firmware for these switches like I think?
 Thanks for any input!

                              <span>Anyone has done testing with 400Gbps Network Interface Card with iperf? What are the maximum bandwidth. If using Mellanox, do you go for InfiniBand or Ethernet mode? I wonder if there are some default configs in the cards that would allow you to easily test the cards?

                              <span>I applied for a mid level NE job and was informed that the next stage of the interview process was an &#x27;interactive&#x27; interview where they ask me to build up a portion of a network and then they break it and ask me to fix it. In this session, I would have access to a computer on the video call so all attendees can watch and ask questions/challenge me.
 Is this normal for this type of position, or any engineering position? I have been asked to take knowledge tests or answer hypothetical situations on how I think, but never introduced to a simulation where I would be quized.
 Just looking to see how common this is and if I should run now lol.

                              <span>Hi all. I was wondering if I could get some assistance or pointed in the right direction with configuring two sonicwall devices as I am not the most familiar with these devices.
 My network is as follows: I have a set of WAPs that go into an unmanaged switch and into a TZ350 (FW1) on X0 to reach the internet. That works just fine. The private network is currently using 192.168.150.0/24
 We are switching ISPs and there is a NSA2700 (FW2) being added as well. Currently going through X15 on this sonicwall works fine as well.
 The issue that I am having is traffic will not want to flow from one interface to another.
 Right now it is WAP -&gt; Switch -&gt; FW1 -&gt; ISP1
 And what I&#x27;m trying to do is WAP -&gt; Switch -&gt; X2 on FW1 -&gt; X3 on FW1 -&gt; x15 (DMZ) FW2 -&gt; ISP2.
 I&#x27;m running into issues with getting any sort of traffic incoming on X2 to be shot out X3. I asked this question on spiceworks, but the things that were suggested did not seem to work. And one of the responses also seemed to be generated by chatgpt.
 If I can provide any additional information that would be of assistance, please let me know.
 Regards.

                              <span>Just had a need to walk a device that supports SNMP v3 and apparently ireasoning MIB Browser can&#x27;t do that. 
 What&#x27;s a good scan/test tool for SNMP v3? 
 Very much prefer to not have a full NMS, I just want to test a device and see if it works.

 I have a subnet. There is a DHCP server I have little control over. I can bring up network interfaces on hosts on this subnet. Works fine. Normal stuff.
 I would like to netboot a client from a different DHCP server. It is possible for me to specify which DHCP server to use on the client at PXE boot time?
 thanks.

 does anyone has cheap solution for remote console access for network equipement? 
 Basically I need some kind of host that will have many RS232 ports to connect to our firewalls and core switches with serial console cable.

 Is doing netmiko over console possible, and if so, could someone show me an example of how to do it? I cannot seem to find a straightforward answer on google.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am part of a big team with over 10000 network devices (switches, routers, FW etc etc). We have a lot of tools that manage polling, metrics and alerts and I am trying to find a suitable solution for us to migrate.
 My team has tried different tools that didn&#x27;t quite fit but also gave us some insight on what is important.
  
Being future-proof. High availability, scaling and good performance.
 Ability to do some chained lookups. We do some complex collections that require correlating between different OIDs.
 Ability to stream data easily to other tools.
  
LibreNMS was one of the tools i tried but it doesn&#x27;t really tick all 3 boxes.
 Prometheus+Grafana seems very interesting, but i am not sure that point 2 is possible.
 Some licence solutions we found are very expensive but also I don&#x27;t like feeling &quot;locked&quot; to a vendor.
 Zabbix seems like a very fitting solution. I didn&#x27;t like the luck of HA solution but there are ways around it.
 Any suggestion or correction on what I am trying to achieve here?
 Thank you for your time.

 I can say that I have worked places where there was DR, DR was “tested”, but it’s never truly DR- always some service here or there that pointed to an IP instead of hostname or had something similar hardcoded somewhere… static routes instead of dynamic routing.. many of these things having been band-aids/ad-how fixes but forgotten about and never revisited.

                              <span>Hi ! 
 I&#x27;m working on a new backbone, and I&#x27;m trying to understand/solve traceroute to internet.
 When packet enter on the backbone, I can see three IP by line...
 Ex:
 1 192.168.92.1 (192.168.92.1) 2.073 ms 2.681 ms 2.677 ms
 2 80.X.X.X (80.X.X.X) 14.157 ms 14.140 ms 12.365 ms
 3 toto (80.X.X.Y) 2.875 ms 3.561 tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.910 ms
 4 IXP (A.A.A.A) 9.806 ms tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.535 ms IXP (A.A.A.A) 8.044 ms 
 It seems like a loop, but I don&#x27;t know where to start the investigation.
 It&#x27;s a small backbone with OSPF as IGP. 
 ASBR1 ------- L3 Switch1 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; L3 Switch2 --------- ASBR2 
 ASBR1 and ASBR2 send default route via OSPF, so each L3 Switch has 2 default route (one is selected). 
 If you have an idea... 
 Thanks !

                              <span>Is it common to activate Mac bypass on every port? I am mostly using 801.1x for authentication but some devices require Mac bypass. Right now I have Mac bypass only activated on ports that need it, so I have a problem when devices change positions. Is it common to have 801.1X and Mac bypass active on all ports? If so do you change the order of them or just leave it to default?

                              <span>Hello Guys, 
 I&#x27;m just curious as to how you filter routes in Viptela. For example, if I need to find a specific route in the vEdge cli routing table, do I only have the execute using &quot;Include&quot; or adding the correct IP and subnet? 
 Ex. It will take some time to verify whether I got a route if I attempt to to search this IP 10.1.192.1/32.
 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1/32 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 | i 10.1.192. | nomore vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1 show ip best-match-route vpn 1 ipv4 10.1.192.1 * --------------------------------------------^ syntax error: unknown argument Error executing command: CLI command error - 
 It occasionally fails too by not adding the subnet or incorrect subnet. 
 What other option do I have to determine the route that a host or IP belongs to in viptela?
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>I work for a government contractor so their IT security is naturally tighter than a typical organisation. They have to comply with government compliance etc.
 I have a server I need to deploy and it needs to make outbound SFTP connections to an IP address on the Internet. The standard response our team gets from the security team is that they do not allow servers direct access to the Internet. 
 The server will connect to one trusted IP address to download some files each day. It is secured using SFTP using a certificate for encryption and authenticates with a username and password. The firewall rule would be configured to allow SFTP from this one source internal IP address to this one public address only for SFTP only. They still think this is too risky...
 Instead what they want me to do…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a field tech for an ISP. I have a Link Sprinter that IDs switch mac/IP, cable link (10/100/1000), and checks DHCP, Gateway, and web access. 
 But I&#x27;ve misplaced it. Can&#x27;t justify dropping $450 to replace it right now. 
 Looking for a software for a windows laptop that can perform some of those same features when testing a single ethernet drop. 
 Honestly, the Link Sprinter has spoiled me, especially with the switch port ID when troubleshooting offline APs. No power? Cool switch port may have lost POE function. As long as I have solid link to a switch, I can ID which switch port the AP drop is on without toning/tracing. Saves multiple trips back/forth to IDF. 
 Any pointers?

 Mine is small in the long run but reeks of egregious incompetence.
 We have two domain controllers running DHCP, each with two interfaces. Primary DC has 10.x.x.10 and 10.x.x.20 Secondary DC has 10.x.x.11 and 10.x.x.21
 Our Meraki&#x27;s relay all DHCP discover packets to either the .20 or .21 interface, the rest of the DHCP handshake appears to go out the .10 or .11 interface.
 In this meeting that I was not invited to (I have a network engineering diploma and my CCNA) they decided to perform an audit of these latter two interfaces and decided that they weren&#x27;t in use and to disable each interface. Obviously when I get in the morning I get a flood of tick…</span>

 One of my mates is really in to Jurassic Park and would talk about the moral/ethical probs of the Hammond bringing back dinosaurs and messing with nature etc etc. 
 I shot him down and said it was actually down to the IT guy! If Hammond hadn’t employed his step son Dennis as the only IT guy then the park would not have been shut down and them all escaping. He had too much control by himself. 
 The only lesson is don’t employ family and friends and always instil multi admin with least access privs. I’d love to turn this into an actual case study for getting new business.

                              <span>For your second IT job ever? I basically have a defacto sysadmin role without the title and pay. Instead I&#x27;m an &quot;IT Specialist&quot;, whatever that means. Since it&#x27;s very much a generalist role, with everything under the sun related to computers thrown at me.
 It&#x27;s weird going from just basic desktop helpdesk support to having to carve out your own IT infrastructure, manage a Cisco network (with all the specialization that entails for different kinds of devices), manage multiple online platforms like SharePoint, onboarding new computers and developing a deployment system for them, deploying VoIP, setting up weird atypical networking to fit the needs of electrical engineers at your company, dealing with people not in my field who think they know more than you (and in some cases do), helping out …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been assigned the project of finding a HAM tool for overseeing all our devices for a distribution company (laptops, desktops, POD scanners, POD printers, scan guns, forklift computers, etc).
 A couple initial challenges are we use multiple MDMs and have multiple companies/locations: (for example, Company A uses AirWatch and Company B uses SOTI for transportation MDM. Company A and Company B both use Ivanti Avalanche for warehouse MDM). Our laptops and computers are currently managed on NAV (an absolute mess from what I&#x27;ve seen). Company B was recently acquired, and this is one note to resolve.
 Is it normal for Support needing to manage both separately (MDM for enrolling/updating, and a HAM for assigning, spare pool, etc)? Is there solutions that can help integrate together?
 We have a SAM tool that specialized in SaaS discovery, complexing licensing, and IT contracts, but doesn&#x27;t have a HAM function. I&#x27;m considered discovery on ServiceNow for this, but I know that system can be a bull in a china shop and may be more than we need. Also like Freshservice&#x27;s initial offerings.

                              <span>So I just got my Twitter API access notification today. We have a simple twitter feed widget on our digital signage
 At the top of the Enterprise sign up form (which is a Google Form for fuck sake) there is this statement:
  
DISCLAIMER: This is an Enterprise API tier application, which enables continued access to v1.1, v2 and additional Enterprise APIs. Pricing starts at $42,000 / Month based on usage and needs.
  
The digital signage widget only supports the v1.1 API and the basic tier only gives access to v2 as far as I can tell. 
 We also got notification from our web host that they are removing the twitter feed widget from their CMS. Apparently the quote they got from twitter to cover all of their customers would have required them to charge EACH CUSTOMER $10K PER MONTH. To display the last 10 tweets on our website. GTFO.
 Either Elon is actively trying to destroy twitter or he&#x27;s so out of touch that he thinks companies are going to pay what amounts to extortion.
 I thought the whole purpose of charging for API access was to weed out the bots. Why is he charging for low volume pull requests too?
 Here&#x27;s the enterprise form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO3bczKWO2jFHyVZJUSEGfdyfFaqt2MvmOfl_aJp0KxMqtDA/viewform

 I was referred here from r/InformationTechnology
 Is there a specific Reddit for warning people to stay away from an IT equipment vendor or at least post my experience?
 I dealt with a vendor who accepted payment for items but never shipped us the order. After requesting a refund, they gave us excuse after excuse for 3 months as to why I hadn&#x27;t received the refund. It wasn&#x27;t until after I opened a case with the Attorney General&#x27;s office of Pennsylvania that they refunded us our money. It was just over $4k they were paid for goods that were never delivered. The order was initially placed on December 6, 2022 and we didn&#x27;t receive the refund until March 6, 2023.
 I want to warn everyone to stay away from Server Tech Supply of Prospect Park, PA. They also have a location in Woodbridge, VA

 Basically this will send app notification emails like Sharepoint, Teams, etc... from a domain and address you specify, and they are sent from your actual Exchange Online instance.
 This will mean it&#x27;s an internal email and any External tagging you might have will not apply, which would also increase visibility on spoofs.
 Haven&#x27;t yet turned it on since it&#x27;s still in preview, but looks promising!

                              <span>This is a relatively minor issue, but they&#x27;re out of spec with RFC 5321 -- instead of talking to me about it, their answer is &quot;talk to your mail admin and have them fix it&quot;.
 I AM the mail admin. Changing my config would mean more spam, and less security. Can I tell management to tell the customer to go fuck themselves if they won&#x27;t even talk to me?
 EDIT:
 Their &#x27;senior infrastructure engineer&#x27; called me, and in chronological order: 
  
Ignored the diagnostic information I provided them
 
Blamed me for the problem
 
Told me to change my mail server config to accept their broken DNS (lol nope)
 
Told me to whitelist his domain (Why the fuck would I fake their DNS records on our server?)
 
When I sent the RFC Section &amp; paragraph number...
 
Told me they&#x27;re in the midst of a migration
 
Told me that they wouldn&#x27;t fix it for months, if ever
 
Said they&#x27;d solve the problem by giving our employees their own eMail addresses on their mail server for &#x27;ease of communication&#x27;.
 
 My manager gave me the ok to tell them to go fuck themselves. One less problem in my world.

                              <span>Apparently we lost an Oracle legend this year. A co-worker and I were reminiscing on the awfulness of inheriting an Oracle database server we knew nothing about. As a sysadmin who has worn many hats, I&#x27;ve had to deal with Oracle database servers in the past (ugh, and present). This guy was my savior in many a situation.

 ​
 So I&#x27;ve had two seperate backup providers ask me to enable custom scripting on Sharepoint so they can get the backups rolling. Is this standard procedure now for cloud backups? Just a bit uneasy as it could cause some security implictions. 
 ​
 Any input would be appreciated, thanks!

 Had surgery last Monday...with Easter weekend prior and recovery I was out of the office for 9 days. Mentally feel refreshed and invigorated. The company didn&#x27;t implode and the world didn&#x27;t burn.
 Take care of yourselves mentally, if you feel exhausted...take a break longer than the prescribed 2 day weekend. You&#x27;re body and mind will thank you.

This issue persists for calls directed to the call queue as well as individual end users. Our setup utilises Microsoft Direct Routing in conjunction with Gamma.
 Despite testing the system on three separate networks, the problem remains. It also affects all devices, including Yealink, Windows, Android, and iOS, regardless of updating them to the latest Teams version.
 With our call queues operating in conference mode, we have attempted to disable this feature but to no avail. Gamma has conducted a call trace and reported that they were able to hear both sides of the conversation. We would greatly appreciate any assistance in addressing this ongoing issue. 
 It has now been a week since our phone system issues began, and we have yet to receive a concrete update or solution from Microsoft.

                              <span>I have this scenario where several &quot;scans&quot; have been done on a machine. And never found anything. However as soon as I clicked on a file and asked it to do a manual scan. It flagged it as malware.
 What concerns me is that this machine has had numerous &quot;full scans&quot; via SentinelOne. If the full scan did not find it. Then what good is it? Could there be a bunch of other malicious files on the network that the full scan is simply ignoring for some strange reason?
 I went all over the interface. We&#x27;re using the singularity version. I can&#x27;t find anything on scan settings. It just does scan then says its complete. 
 What am I missing here? I made sure the agent is running as &quot;Local System&quot;. That was default I never changed it.

                              <span>I have a fleet of Windows10/11 and switch my encryption from WPA2-Enterprise to WPA3-Enterprise and all my Windows machines are repoting using WPA2-Enterprise. My meraki SSID is set to use WPA3 only and the authentication logs in Meraki are showing it is using WPA3-Enterprise authentication as well. What gives and how can I confirm the Windows client are authenticating with WPA3? The client do support WPA-3 based on the netsh wlan show drivers command.

                              <span>This seems like a fairly straightforward problem, unfortunately we&#x27;re having trouble coming up with a solution that doesn&#x27;t seem janky.
 Our scenario: US-east coast based company, Windows 10/11 endpoints, we have a small (6 person) satellite office in Korea.
 None of our end users have local admin permissions on their laptops, so periodically they&#x27;ll need IT assistance to install applications or install drivers (i.e. printers, etc.).
 For folks in timezones that have business hours overlapping with ours, this is a non-issue - we BOMGAR into their laptops, provide the admin credentials, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle.
 The challenge we&#x27;re trying to figure out is how to handle this where business hours don&#x27;t overlap. We can ask end users to leave their computers turned on, which allows us to BOMGAR in unattended, but per best practices, we have a GPO that locks their computer screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, so up &#x27;til now, we&#x27;ve been asking the end user for their password so we can impersonate them. I hate that we do this as it seems janky AF.
 I know we could always sign in as ourselves on their PC and install the software, but unfortunately a lot of the software we&#x27;ve seen is poorly written and has to be installed as the user account that needs to use it.
 The obvious solution is to tell the company that we need to extend our helpdesk operating hours, or we need to have folks on call to handle this type of issue. The first is a non-starter due to $$, and the second is undesirable because who wants to be on call?
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone has come up with a better solution for scenarios like this?
 If Windows had some sort of built-in impersonation functionality that could be used to login as an end user (that was properly restricted and audited), that seems like it could be a solution, but I&#x27;m not aware of anything like that existing.
 Is this something a 3rd party login manager like Okta, etc. could help us with?

 I need to change the shadow copy MaxSize setting on multible serveres/workstations (+200) - mostly Windows OS.
 I can&#x27;t find a way to do it in &quot;one&quot; step.
 It should also handle multible disks on the workstations/Serveres
 Any one have a solution?

 I&#x27;m not a Nutanix customer anymore, but maybe someone that is can complain to their sales people. I know that many companies do this, but was surprised that the source was so clearly identified.

                              <span>Hello,
 I need help.
 We currently experience very slow Internet speeds on one of my managed locations.
 According to the ISP it&#x27;s because we maxed out our Internet bandwidth.
 That would align with my testing.
 Here is the Problem:
 How do I find out which device is using all of the Internet bandwidth all of a sudden.
 Nether the device fleet nor the internet bandwidth changes in the last weeks.
 ​
 I am worried it might be something malicious like a data extraction.
 We are using Unifi switches but I can&#x27;t see any option in the unifi cloud to monitor device usage of the bandwidth.
 ​
 Thanks (and sorry english isn&#x27;t my first language)

                              <span>I started this week a new role in which I&#x27;ll have to decide/suggest what tools we should use. Now, I&#x27;ve seen other companies use certs as the authentication method, and obviously I like these more than asking people to write down whatever the 2FA app tells them to, everyday. One thing I don&#x27;t fully understand (and forgive me for this) is if these certs are the &quot;token&quot; of an actual VPN connection, or if these companies I&#x27;ve seen didn&#x27;t implement a real VPN solution.
 I&#x27;m looking for recommendations based on latest available technologies, good practices, and overall easiness of use.
 We are less than 99 users and everyone has their laptop/VDI administered by an MSP, so whatever tool I decide to use... it should be easy to deploy.
 Thanks!

I asked for the reason business reason for the exception and was told &quot;It keeps me sane&quot;. I allowed it in fear of retaliation but am going to walk that back this morning.
 Would you report this to HR, his boss or something else?
 EDIT: I setup device control with S1 a bit ago and in the initial conversation it was agreed by the owner on my recommendation that we limit devices that can be connected to company computers to business use only.

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 we moved into a new office and would like to enhance overall our presentation vibes. Management has the idea to install Barco Clickshare, but overall it looks nice etc. however it feels massivly overpriced for what it does.
 The majority of our team members are using macs, some external guests might come in with a windows device.
 Am I nuts to seek for a cheaper yet better solution? This can not be that much of a quest, right?
 Too new of a topic for me, however if airplay wouln&#x27;t have such a crazy latency i&#x27;d rather would suggest that.
 Also we would need to use an external camera + speakers (mic) in our setup.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 We use CodeTwo and some users have complained about a double empty line of space occurring when they reply to emails between the end of their text and the signature. 
 This only happens with replies and it&#x27;s easy enough to avoid removing the extra line and ensure the text ends at the grey line, but a few users are still complaining. Is there a way to make it so Outlook doesn&#x27;t add that extra reply line?

                              <span>Hello,
 i currently have 10+ clients in a DMZ and want them to retrieve their time from the official Windows NTP Server. I can only get it to work by allowing UDP Port 123 access to ANY destination. It doesn&#x27;t work when I set the destination to time.windows.com only. Why is that? That&#x27;s the correct address according to microsoft.
 Can anyone enlighten me here?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am part of a big team with over 10000 network devices (switches, routers, FW etc etc). We have a lot of tools that manage polling, metrics and alerts and I am trying to find a suitable solution for us to migrate.
 My team has tried different tools that didn&#x27;t quite fit but also gave us some insight on what is important.
  
Being future-proof. High availability, scaling and good performance.
 Ability to do some chained lookups. We do some complex collections that require correlating between different OIDs.
 Ability to stream data easily to other tools.
  
LibreNMS was one of the tools i tried but it doesn&#x27;t really tick all 3 boxes.
 Prometheus+Grafana seems very interesting, but i am not sure that point 2 is possible.
 Some licence solutions we found are very expensive but also I don&#x27;t like feeling &quot;locked&quot; to a vendor.
 Zabbix seems like a very fitting solution. I didn&#x27;t like the luck of HA solution but there are ways around it.
 Any suggestion or correction on what I am trying to achieve here?
 Thank you for your time.

 But developers do sometimes run queries that last overnight via a local install of ssms on the remote server over RDP. 
 Can anyone think of a couple ways for them to postpose the pending reboot of the servers they are expecting to use overnight but only for a 24 hour period? A desktop icon would be sick that runs a scheduled task that skips the otherwise pending reboot. Bonus points if instead a user can instead exclude themselves from a group policy that logs off idle connections albeit for a 24 hour period.

                              <span>Hi All
 We have approx 100 laptops on 3rd party sites ( all different site owners) where the internet is managed by the customer that are blocking Windows updates from being accessible. We have asked to be whitelisted but proving a pain to get them to do.
 We dont have a WSUS server as all laptops are in AzureAD and we are headless ( no servers any more). 
 I am hence wondering if way(s) around as assume its being blocked either via proxy, wan ( domain name eg windowsupdate.microsoft.com ) being accessible. 
 Happy to consider a paid solution (subject to cost).
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi!
 We have some production servers and would like to change the backup method from push (the servers currently upload the backups it makes to an SFTP server), to PULL, so we have a remote server, which will run Truenas Core, and will pull the backups of the production server.
 This is usually done with Rsync via SSH, but the cybersecurity team is worried that if the backup server gets compromised, the ssh credentials could be used to open a remote shell in the production server.
 The backup server would be really isolated, only accessible via our corporate VPN and to the production server to grab the backups. But still, if a bad actor could get access to the corporate VPN, somehow get the credentials to the backup server, they could get the SSH keys used to do the rsync job and remote into the production server.
 Is there any way we could prevent this? maybe using other kind of software so we don&#x27;t have to open SSH access between the production and backup servers?
 The production servers are mainly linux but some windows servers aswall. Is there any way a user could be make in linux so not only the user has access to just the backups, but is not able to execute other commands?

 Hope they haven&#x27;t been shut down and it&#x27;s just unplanned maintenance.

                              <span>Basically if I copy something, there is always a chance it will appear to somebody else when they paste, and vice versa. I sometimes just get random pasted text.
 I have never noticed this with images, only text.
 ​
 We also use vSphere, and copy/paste there is a complete disaster (for other reasons), but even when working locally and pasting locally, it does not always work.
 ​
 What is the cause of this? Windows? Network infrastructure? Something else?

                              <span>I got asked by a colleague to present MS Entra to my bosses (small company doing consulting for IAM). I have five minutes and the company works mainly with OIM, so every listener understands IAM way better then I do. I dont like to talk about stuff that I dont understand fairly well, so I am seeking for a bit of help here to not talk rubbish.
 Im fairly new to IAM and only worked with Active Roles so far and a tiny bit on OIM synchronizing CSV-Files to the system. So my knowledge of OIM is pretty limited. Knowledge about Sailpoint is basically non existent. 
 Last year MS launched Entra which includes AAD, a CIEM-Solution, Entra Verified ID and Workload Identities. As far as im aware &quot;MS Entra Identity Governance&quot; is also a new component. 
 I would like to quickly go through the components and then focus on things Entra does way better or way worse than the the other to products.
 I would like to focus on the connection to other systems (especially On-Prem-Systems), since it looks like this could be a weakspot of MS Entra. Is there anything MS Entra (or Azure AD) cant do and why?
 Lifecycle-Management is also a topic I want to focus on. Looks to me like I am pretty limited to what MS offers out of the box. For example if I create a new Workflow for a Leaver I can put in a step, that a mail is sent to the employees manager, but not to the colleagues. 
 Is there anything else MS does greatly or badly on this topic?
 I do greatly appreciate your help girls and guys, since I am really not sure about what to focus on and where the weaknesses of each application are. According to the websites they all can do everything and do everything best.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to deploy a Windows 11 In Place Upgrade with our software deployment tool. The prep is already done, ISO extracted, batch file with all the params created. 
 When I manually execute the batch file that basically says 
 setup.exe /auto upgrade /DynamicUpdate disable /showoobe none /Telemetry disable
 it asks me for admin credentials and after entering them with 2 clicks it just does the upgrade. When I&#x27;m logged in as an admin it just shows the user access control window with Yes / No and does it. But that credential request shouldn&#x27;t come up for regular users, obviously. 
 When I execute this batch file from the deployment service however it just doesn&#x27;t do anything. The deployment script runs forever and never logs what went wrong. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I use a silent parameter or not. 
 My guess is that the problem is in the context in which the file gets executed. And I have tried all the contexts I could think of. I assume I&#x27;m missing a vital part in the logic chain here that prevents me from seeing the solution. 
 Further info: The setup.exe and files are hosted on a file share that can be read-accessed by anyone. The batch file is on the deployment repository and gets downloaded to the client PC when executing. 
 And I&#x27;ve had a similar issue with a different software deployment tool already when I wanted to put a simple shortcut on the desktop of users on a PC as an admin. It feels like that was a similar context issue back then.

                              <span>Good morning everyone.
 I hope I am not too annoying with my questions lately.
 I am having some problems with Azure Information Protection and the valid applications.
 From what I am reading, it seems to work together with data classification and data loss prevention.
 Which means, if a certain document could contain PII, It can detect this and recommend or apply a sensitivity label on that document, making sure whenever it might leave the company, that the data will be unusable for everyone outside of the company.
 It&#x27;s a defense mechanism, which extrudes outwards, into the public world.
 I&#x27;ve seen examples, where they only use 3-5 Labels with encryption and/or watermarking. This makes total sense to me, as I have worked with PII before.
 My boss now heard this and thinks, that this will solve all of our problems.
 He told me to create 5 sensitivity labels, for each personnel group of our company. From the CEO to the normal employee. Everyone should get access to documents with a certain sensitivty label, but not others.
 From what he described, he wants a protection, which goes inwards. His example shows, that the he is very wary about his employees.
 No watermarking or data classification. Just encrypt everything and make sure, that no normal employee has access to sensitive documents from his team lead or above.
 This feels wrong to me. I haven&#x27;t found any example, where Information Protection was used like this. And with that I have a thousand questions and possible outcomes in my mind, because I feel like that it won&#x27;t stay at 5 labels. In the end I might have to create a label for every project.
 I&#x27;ve seen the quote, that Information Protection are permissions, which move with the documents. But I feel like that my example is a bit &quot;extreme&quot;.
 Has anybody used this before like this? Is this a valid use for Information Protection or is there another solution?

                              <span>I&#x27;m probably just tired, however I have an iis server hosting 1 internal site, but has a few ssl certs from over the years. How can I see which certs are in play on that site and then delete the ones not in use? Is it just as simple as checking the bindings on that one site? I&#x27;ve done that and I see cert4 is bound to the 443 binding, just double want to be absolutely sure that certs 1 to 3 are not bound anywhere else. I was hoping a table or mmc view might show this, but perhaps not.

 So, have any of you even failed an exam? Or were just a couple of points FROM failing?

                              <span>We are a company of almost 50. We have had 15+ employee&#x27;s personal cell phones contacted by a spam number claiming to be the CEO in 1 hour. One employee&#x27;s parent was even contacted &amp; they can&#x27;t think of any place they have their parents&#x27; number (not as an emg contact, beneficiary l, life insurance etc... I first, immediately thought of a breach with Paychex or Bamboo or even LinkedIn, but I&#x27;m not sure... especially because the employee is sure her family member&#x27;s number isn&#x27;t listed anywhere. The fact that the employee&#x27;s parent got a text is really throwing a wrench in this. We&#x27;ve had employees get texts from our &quot;ceo&quot; asking for gift cards, but this isn&#x27;t that. I&#x27;m inclined to think... find where the family member&#x27;s number is listed &amp; find the possible link, but idk... nothing is standing out. The employee said she doesn&#x27;t have her family member&#x27;s number listed on anything work related. This is so scary. Any ideas? Our anti-virus isn&#x27;t picking anything up. Our server &amp; emails are fine I&#x27;m perplexed with the personal cell numbers. Help!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I’ve been in my current role as an IT Technician for the last two years. Although my title doesn’t match what I actually do. My experience in IT is mostly call center and level 1 and 2 troubleshooting but with my current role I’ve been working more with networking and server issues. 
 I want to learn more about how our servers work, how the networking switches are configured and everything else I can learn. The issue is that I don’t know how to figure it all out and my boss doesn’t want to teach me unless it’s relevant at the time. The problem is I’m two years in and I don’t feel like I know enough. Also my boss doesn’t make himself available so when there’s problems I’m left scrambling for answers. 
 Any advice? 
 TLDR: want to learn as much as I can about our IT infrastructure but boss will not help.

                              <span>Hello, I was recently informed my company would like me to store and set up the company&#x27;s firewall at my home in order to make it seem like my home internet is coming from the office. I currently connect through a VPN so I dont need it. 
 Many on the IT team seem excited to have these at their home, but my main question is doesn&#x27;t all my internet traffic on my router then go through the company&#x27;s firewall? This would be a stand alone device that hooks into my router, but that seems super sketchy to have a company device like that always monitoring my network traffic.

I ended up getting hired and things were great at first. Nice pace where i could learn new technologies but now I feel like i made a mistake as all I get when asking questions is a forwarded email and I&#x27;m supposed to know to just contact someone else to figure it out. I ask detailed questions and get sent one sentence replies to google some phrase as if I know or understand any context as to why that would be the issue. Is this standard in the industry where I&#x27;m just on my own to try and figure out things

                              <span>Today i gave control over the entire IT to an MSP, because im leaving the company and there‘s no one left, which could take over my tasks. I was a single sysadmin/tech at that company. So my boss choose an MSP and today i did gave him my documentation and a training session. Job done. 
 However, what i saw truly blew my mind. Here are a few things, which made me believe i‘m in the wrong movie.
 1) Gave him access to one 1Password Vault. He didn‘t know what it is (fine, not everyone can know everything) and he said how insecure this is. I asked him, why he came to this conclusion when he didn‘t read the whitepaper and what tool he would choose. Answer: My laptop uses bitlocker, that‘s why i store everything in excel. I asked him what he would do if his devices getting compromised? As long as his device is powered on bitlocker doesn‘t help. Well, if i get compromised it‘s over anyway, a password manager wouldn‘t help. 
 2) he doesn‘t deactivate or remove the local admin account, because he‘s the only one who knows the password anyway.
 3) he couldn‘t tell the difference between MB and GB/TB.
 4) he has no clue about linux and has no employee who does and still manages linux machines.
 I needed to vent, cause i always was thinking i‘m still not good enough for a sole sysadmin role to get a job at another company (i did, but struggled long time to do this step) and did know more than a MSP boss with 100s of clients…

 The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a nationwide ground stop for Southwest Airlines flights, citing “equipment issues.”
 “Southwest Airlines requested the FAA pause the airline’s departures,” the agency told CNN in a statement.
 Southwest Airlines reported technology issues Tuesday morning and said it would “hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible.” c
 The flight tracking website FlightAware said nearly 800 of the airline’s flights – about 14 percent of its schedule – were delayed Tuesday, far ahead of any US carrier.
 Southwest called the problem “intermittent technology issues” in a social media post to customers. Several have taken to social media to complain about delayed flights
 “We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we’re hoping to get everyone going ASAP,” the airline wrote in another social media post.
 CNN has reached out to Southwest and the Federal Aviation Administration for further comment.

                              <span>Last year, my boss left for another company and I put my name forward to replace him because it seemed like a great opportunity to jump ahead at a growing org. 
 There are two other people on my team who I really like and I feel I’ve stepped up into a leadership role for them pretty well. 
 The problem is I don’t stop worrying about crashes, incidents and meltdowns any time I’m not online. 
 It came to a head this week when I canceled a vacation to Morocco because I didn’t want to risk being offline. 
 I’m guessing this promotion was a mistake? Any way to salvage this?

                              <span>I would like to take a minute and just say thank you to all the universities out there that put together in-depth wikis and make them available to the public. So many times my troubleshooting and research have led me to a university wiki page. Usually these pages are straightforward, easy to read, and well put together. Most of the time listing exactly what needs to be done or tweaked, down to the last registry key.
 Again, thank you. I know what a pain it is to put these together. Your hard work does not go unnoticed and is much appreciated!

Deployed them all to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Signatures... all good. Then last night during patch Tuesday, Microsoft implements new roaming signatures and such, completely changing the look and feel of the signature settings (so our screenshot documented instructions are no longer valid), but most everyone&#x27;s signature is moved to &quot;Signatures on this Device&quot;, not &quot;Personal Signatures&quot;, and as Signatures on this Device, cannot be set as the default signature to apply to new messages! Not only that, but there&#x27;s not a simple copy button to move it to Personal Signatures. (yes, you can copy and paste the text, go to Personal and hit New, give it a name and paste in the designer box, but we&#x27;re talking about elderly employees that it took 5 pages of instructions to just to implement the signatures in the first place.

                              <span>Is there a way to forward users to different SAML SSO based on their group membership within AD? I know AzureAD allows you to federate the domain in an “all or nothing” method. I am interested in redirecting to others based on membership/testing. Would ADFS make that easier?

                              <span>Almost a month ago I was laid off, and without work for the first time in 15 years. I got depressed and it seemed like no one was hiring. I submitted over 200 applications and resumes and that first week or two all I got were rejection letters. I worked on my resume and cover letter and finally had 6 interviews last week. I ended up with 2 job offers so far, but what really got me was the way the manager of one of the companies went about it. He went back to his boss and asked for 15% more than the top end of the posted salary range because &quot;We need this guy, and we need to be competitive in the market to get him&quot; (his exact words). I ended up taking a ~20% pay cut from where I was before the layoff, but I think I found a place that wants me. 
 It was really nice to feel like the pretty girl at the dance for once. Keep it up, there is a job out there that really wants every one of us, I was just lucky to find one when I needed it the most.

                              <span>Hi everyone - I&#x27;m back again with the 2023 update to our password table! You can read see it at www.hivesystems.io/password.
 Computers, and GPUs in particular, are getting faster (looking at you ChatGPT). This table outlines the time it takes a computer to brute force your password, and isn’t indicative of how fast a hacker can break your password (especially if they phished you). It’s a good visual to show people why better passwords can lead to better cybersecurity - but ultimately it’s just one of many tools we can use to talk about protecting ourselves online!

                              <span>I registered a 3 letter .help domain at NameCheap around the time the novelty .help and .support domains were first intoduced (can’t remember exactly) and I was charged by namecheap approx $33 USD for the registration for the year up until now. 
 I get an auto renewal reminder email this AM saying my domain is set to auto renew in May for $1200 USD for the year!
 I opened up a support chat with NameCheap and they indicate the registry for .help now considers my domain to be classified as premium. 
 Wtf is this? There was no warning or indication of a price increase, a literal arbitrary cost increase based on an existing registered domain, and classifying it as premium after the fact is flat out extortion. 
 I’m considering transferring the domain away from NameCheap to another registrar. I’m looking for advice to see if anyone knows of any .help registrars that offer a free or low cost transfer option, and hopefully a reasonable renewal rate. 
 I see hover has .help support but their renewal rate is approx $1000 after the first year. I don’t know what PorkBun offers. Neither of these places I have an account for. 
 Has this happened to you before?
 Would it be worth bringing this up to ICANN?
 Would love to know your thoughts.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of posts over the years from computer techs who absolutely cringe at the idea of working on home computers, and I&#x27;m curious why.
 I work on home and small business computers. In a medium metro area I bill $140 for a home visit up to 1.5 hours, then $80/hour. Since many calls end up being &quot;install a printer,&quot; or &quot;get rid of my pop-ups&quot; some of those calls end up taking 20-45 minutes, and I can sometimes finish 5-7 calls in a 8 hour day.
 Have additional problems? Book an additional appointment. 
 I&#x27;ve been doing this for about 19 years with VERY few major issues, and I find the stress to be incredibly low in my residential work.
 When it comes to income, if I maintain just 4 residential appointments each day for 45 weeks a year, income would be $126,000, again, with minimal stress (although admittedly more car wear &amp; tear).
 When you are competing with the big box stores, you really don&#x27;t have competition. 
 Why the hate on residential?

                              <span>I see that this was made available as an optional feature several years ago and still requires you to manually enable it for your domain today.
 It lets you use a PowerShell command to set the membertimetolive attribute when you add a member to a group so the accounts automatically lose access to the group after a set length of time.
 Is this really useful? It seems impractical because I don’t see any parameter you can set to schedule a future start time. For instance giving a user membership to a group during a future change window.
 You would need to use a scheduled task running as an account with privileges to add users to groups and scheduling it to run the command at the future date and time. If you are messing with scheduled tasks anyway, you can do almost the same thing already without activating this optional feature. Just run two tasks. One to add the membership and another to remove the membership,

                              <span>Good day!
 May I ask for some help and recommendations, to setup Windows Defender? Especially for Mail attachments.
 Some Background. Currently we are switching from Forti Endpoint Security to Windows Defender for Business.
 I&#x27;ve checked all common options in Intune and checked out the windows defender playground and demo files. Everything gets detected from my tests.
 Regarding Internet Security I feel somewhat safe now.
 Though, I have problems in detecting email attachment. Several times per week I receive notifications from my forti ems server, about newly found malware in mail attachments. We receive a high amount of fake invoices, voice messages or other stuff, hidden in html files. Typical javascript stuff, phishing. 
 For me this is obvious. Invoices shoulnd&#x27;t arrive in html format.
 And yet, people who are already using the windows defender ask me regularly &quot;Is this spam?&quot;
 Stuff like &quot;Customer Invoice LIQUIDATION CENTER LTD.html&quot; faking a identical clone of the microsoft authentication. Forti was able to detect these kinds of attacks, but not the defender.
 We have also setup a Office 365 Anti-Phishing Policy. But I feel like it&#x27;s not working as it should, or it only applies to mails, but doesn&#x27;t apply on attachments?
 What am I doing wrong? Why isn&#x27;t stuff like this getting detected?

                              <span>I want to preface this by saying that even though I use the word &quot;we&quot; extensively, I have only been employed here about 2 weeks. Our IT department is me and my boss. My position was newly created. So &#x27;we&#x27;, really means &#x27;boss&#x27;.
 Also, links to a place where I can read more about this subject is appreciated.
 ​
 We run about a 100 android tablets through MaaS360 and android enterprise. When we first started doing this, we used a single gmail account to set up all the devices. However when we got to about 30 devices or so, it started dropping devices. So we created a second account. Same problem, but it was around 20 devices this time. So on so forth, now we have several gmail accounts managing our devices. I cannot find anything online that indicates a limit. MaaS360 doesn&#x27;t have a limit in our range I know. 
 Now I did see that there is a limit to 10 devices per user in MaaS360. One possibility is that we would set up devices for different users, but my supervisor would set up test devices under her name. This would then cause registration issues for subsequent devices. This only sort of makes sense though, because I can&#x27;t see her setting up 10+ devices for herself. I also think it was dropping other users devices, not her devices. 
 I feel the need to include timeframe here as well, in case things changed. We started this process about 5 or 6 years ago and slowly ran into issues. 
 ​
 Anything you can help me with this is welcome. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, I am aware that this is a bad practice, but I just noticed that one of my customers (active directory environment) has the habit to log as Administrator on every workstation to accomplish tasks like: Windows updates, installing software, ... 
 I think that there is a security issue here, since Administrator credentials will be cached on workstations.
 I wondering if the same risk will happens if that admin uses RDP to access machines remotely? 
 If a workstation is suddenly rebooted, cached credentials will be gone, correct, or will they still be there?
 Thank you for your suggestions

                              <span>Hi All,
 Having a weird one, I have just stood up a new DHCP server. Previously the DC handled the DHCP.
 In the Event viewer, I am getting the following errors
 PTR record registration for IPv4 address [[192.168.130.111]] and FQDN ******.******.local failed with error 9005 (DNS operation refused.)
 PTR record registration for IPv4 address [[192.168.132.87]] and FQDN *******.*******.local failed with error 10051 (A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network.)
 I have created the user dns_update and added them to the dnsproxyupdate group and use these credentials within the DCHP server, but the errors remain.
 Anyone else had this? If so, how did you resolve it?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Has anyone run up against this issue with the April MS patches?: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview#legacy-laps-interop-issues-with-the-april-11-2023-update
 My environment leverages Group Policy to install the LAPSx64.msi (I&#x27;m assuming this installer encompasses the client-side extensions mentioned in the article above). We have a number of OSs that miss the coverage window on the new Windows LAPS coverage, and so we will continue using the legacy LAPS solution for the time being. 
 Can someone check my logic?:
  
Installing the 04/2023 MS Updates on devices that currently have legacy LAPS installed will continue to operate normally.
 New devices that receive the 04/2023 MS Updates (baked into an image, installed via task sequence on deployment, etc.) and THEN receive the LAPS CSE msi will then break
 THEREFORE: As long as LAPS CSE is installed before 04/2023 update, legacy-mode LAPS should work fine. (?)

 Don&#x27;t you love it when you&#x27;re the top level admin for your organization and you&#x27;re forced to open support tickets with software companies and get stuck with level 1 support for months on the same issue with every &quot;solution&quot; that they give you more useless than the last?
 Hey on a side note, if anyone is thinking about using LastPass for idp/SSO and MFA, my recommendation is fuck no.
 If I could go back in time I would rip up the contract and lay a duo product sheet in front of my boss.
 Anyways that&#x27;s all, have a great work day everyone.

 The company i work for wants to go full Microsoft Azure / Microsoft 365 and is heading towards Exchange Online / Sharepoint / MS Teams as main Callcenter and so on...
 I already talked to a GDPR lawyer because of it Microsoft not being compliant. She says its not and even if we are doing everything we can to ensure it, its still not compliant enough or even close because of some rules and some microsoft contract stuff. 
 How are other sysadmins handling this topic in europe? I know that the authorities dont really look into the whole MS Azure thing in germany, but we want to be fully compliant!
 If this is the wrong sub just tell me ;)

                              <span>Hey everyone, wondering if anyone has any ideas or has seen this.
 Its driving me crazy!
 Cannot seem to find anything in google that has been helpful.
 The fingerprint sensor is constantly trying to scan for a fingerprint when nothing is touching it.
 The impact of this is it keeps the windows lock screen active and monitors never turn off etc.
 Just keeps flashing your device is having trouble recognizing you, please try again, constantly.
 ​
 If you touch it, it logs in correctly.
 Device:Asus ROG Flow X13 GV301QE
 Fingerprint device: ELAN WBF Fingerprint sensor - asus driver version is 3.5.12201.11202
 Windows 11 with latest updates
 Troubleshooting: 
 Tried newer drivers, older drivers, specifically listed driver from Asus, no difference.
 Many restarts.
 Nothing specific I can find in event viewer
 ​
 For now I have deleted my fingerprint so its not happening and monitors will turn off etc.

                              <span>Hi guys. If you&#x27;re using it, how do you feel about Microsoft&#x27;s Defender for Endpoint as the only endpoint protection app for your users? In my case, there are about 250 pcs that have Bitdefender Gravityzone installed, with the patch management add-on. But we also recently got licenses for MDE P1 from the main hq (no idea why, maybe it&#x27;s a global requirement but nobody notified us...), enough to cover all those pcs. The question is, should we drop Bitdefender and stick cu MDE only, or keep it like it is?

                              <span>Hello. We have 2 domain controllers at one of our sites that&#x27;s running up replication errors. I&#x27;m not sure where to start with it so I&#x27;m in need of some advice. Firstly, running the command:
 get-addomain generated an error &#x27;server instance not found on the given port&#x27;
 Running the repadmin /replsummary show command generates an error of &#x27;repadmin can&#x27;t connect to a home server. Error: An LDAP lookup operation failed with the following error: LDAP Error 81: Server down&#x27;. 
 Running the repadmin /replsum command shows the following:
 Destination DSA: DC1
 Largest Delta: &gt;60 days
 fails/total%%: 10/10 
 error:  The target principal name is incorrect 
 Finally, running the repadmin /showrepl command shows error KCC could not add this REPLICA LINK due to error. 
 The DCs at the site don&#x27;t hold any FSMO roles so that should things a bit easier. For the replica link issue, I&#x27;ve come across a potential fix that says to delete then recreate the account. For the other issues I&#x27;m not sure what the best approach to take is.
 For the target principal name error, will this fix likely work? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/replication-error-2146893022
 Is it better just to create 2 new DCs for the site?

 Our Dev&#x27;s have local accounts for these Servers. 
 The problem we are facing is that the dev&#x27;s on occasion do not go onto the servers within the account password life setting.
 which means we need to reset passwords for them. 
 I am looking for a way to periodically run a script and email a shared address that their password will soon expire 
 any guidance or assistance will be appreciated

                              <span>We are currently starting to roll out MFA with Azure AD for end-users globally. Usually, we offer the options MS Authenticator on company iPhones or any authenticator app on personal phones. Only a few exceptions so far requested and/or got a hardware TOTP token (by Token2), but it&#x27;s hard to manage for our sites without IT staff and with Microsoft&#x27;s requirement for Global Admin rights for setting them up currently.
 In China we don&#x27;t have a lot of company phones, but a lot of personal Huawei devices without Google services. Any authenticator/TOTP app I suggested is not available in Huawei App Gallery for China and the manual installation of apk files is also not a real option.
 Is there anybody out there who is able to suggest an app which is available in Chinese app stores, especially for Huawei?

                              <span>I&#x27;m reaching out for some advice, input, or just a general plan on how to deal with a challenging situation I&#x27;m currently facing at work. I work in a company where I am responsible for procuring everything but laptops (phones, chargers, monitors, docking stations, printer maintenance services, VESA mounts, laptop bags, headsets, mice, and keyboards).
 To make things even more complicated, I have to categorize each item properly in SAP so management approves these purchases, attaching the &#x27;price offer&#x27; which is often just a screenshot of a price on a website. After that, I have to &#x27;goods movement&#x27; them into SAP, attaching the invoice or proof of work.
 This process is causing me a lot of trouble since finance is constantly telling me that the material group, G/L account, or cost center is incorrect, which forces me to recategorize or start the process over. Unfortunately, my colleague already quit due to the frustration, and my boss has not delivered on promised changes to the process. As a result, I&#x27;m left alone to handle this mess together with all the IT work.
 This situation is taking up hours of my time daily, and I&#x27;m struggling to find a solution. My boss insists that we have to perform these activities and prioritize them, likely because his IT Director reports directly under a Finance director. Procurement says we have to open the Purchase Requisitions, as they can&#x27;t transform them into Purchase orders themselves due to conflict of interest and policy concerns (although I doubt the legitimacy of this claim).
 I didn&#x27;t want to vent, but I&#x27;m genuinely seeking advice and input from the r/sysadmin community. If any of you have faced similar issues or have any tips, suggestions, or a plan to tackle this problem, please share your thoughts. I&#x27;m eager to find a way to streamline this process or at least make it more manageable.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 One of our customers using Sharepoint uses Onedrive to sync the libraries to their desktop PC&#x27;s. Recently we have completely changed the structure of their Sharepoint site, renamed several Libraries and changed A LOT of rights.
 The problem I am now facing, is that users that now lost their permissions to certain libraries or libraries that had their name changed/got removed, will still see the folders on their respective PC&#x27;s. The folders are no longer synced, but they are still present on the systems including files. Every user may even face this on multiple pc&#x27;s as they work on multiple systems (flex). As you know, this may differ for every user aswell, because they all have different rights.
 Question is, do you know any way to automatically remove libraries that are no longer synced?
 The systems are managed through Intune and are all Azure AD joined. I haven&#x27;t been able to solve this braincracker yet and our support desk has been called many many times by customers seeing &#x27;the wrong folders&#x27; or people editting files locally, because they are not synced anymore.
 Thanks.

                              <span>We have deployed a new version of a CRM however on around 10% of machines it won&#x27;t run under the user&#x27;s standard user profile.
 It works when installed as Administrator or RunAsAdministrator.
 The developer is working to resolve the problem but ideally, I&#x27;d like a short-term fix as they didn&#x27;t come across this problem during testing so don&#x27;t currently have time for a fix - is there a way to run only this application on the affected computers with admin privileges? 
 We use LAPS to manage the local administrative account Thanks,

                              <span>So I currently work for an ISP where I run a lot of the day to day frontline staff, mainly Tech Support. The issue right now is a lot of people are jumping ship due to poor management. As more and more people leave, I find myself taking on more work to keep things stable at the company. I thought this added responsibility would befit a raise to which my boss agreed, but I was offered roughly a dollar more (I’m salary). 
 The other part of this is that I was told that I was on track to becoming a VP , but that position was given to an outside hire whom I had to train. So I’m at a point where I feel like I am going nowhere in the company. 
 I was given a new job opportunity at a more mom &amp; pop IT group. While things are definitely going south at my current company, I can’t help but be nervous that maybe I am jumping the gun. 
 The new employer has promised to match my pay, but I am losing earned PTO and my cell phone bill being paid each month. Should I take the position at the mom and pop place ? Whom offered medical benefits , but at a 50% employer paid rate. Or stay at the company that keeps telling me to stay in my lane every time I try to give help where it’s needed? They have no medical benefits at this time. I’m mostly worried about taking a small financial cut and no PTO to get out of a poorly managed company.

                              <span>We&#x27;re dealing with a $30k overage for the past month, and there was no warning at all until the account manager let us know it was coming. They&#x27;ve reduced it, but it&#x27;s definitely not an AWS-style waiving of the full amount.
 Even now, it&#x27;s not actually apparent that we&#x27;re going to be charged that much, unless we go through and calculate rates and usage ourselves. It&#x27;s just insane.
 How do people actually deal with this business risk? This was a single developer writing a single query to create what they thought was a custom metric, that turned out to be a custom metric per unique URL.

                              <span>I am working on setting up a network for a 6 story building. I am thinking of one beefy L3 Switch + 6 simpler L2 Switches. I am trying to find a cost effective (refurbished) L3 switch that supports 10gbit (SFP+). 
 I found two seemingly good deals: - HPE 5800AF-48G for around 300 $ - HPE 5130-48G-4SFP+ for around 250 $
 Both have enough 10g SFP+ which are important to me. The amount of ports are overkill for my scenario but I could not find a good L3 10g switch for less honestly. 
 I only need 8 ports in the distribution layer switch. NAS(10g), NVR, Internet Router(1g), 6 x access switches (Wifi AP, IPCAM, etc.)
 What would you recommend?

 Hello all.
 I&#x27;m very new to using Ansible, and i&#x27;m following a course where his output is gathering Cisco IP information. It&#x27;s returning IP information for him, but i&#x27;m getting very different output so i&#x27;m thinking Ansible changed the way this ansible_facts works, but I don&#x27;t fully understand the documentation to fix this. Below is my sample playbook. Any help would be appreciated. For now, off to google some more...

                              <span>Long story short, got a call from a new client who has their internet drop out every 2 hours at the top of the hour.
 More Detail:
 Client has a 100Mb circuit, and for the past few weeks, their connection dies every 2 hours at the top of the hour for a couple minutes, then comes back up. Pings during those outages show connection to their sonicwall, gets to the gateway, and then dies out from there. At&amp;t tech says that their connection is just getting over saturated with standard traffic, ran a pcap from their end, and no signs of DDos or anything irregular.
 I ran wireshark from a client machine and saw nothing out of the ordinary other than packets trying to resend during the outages, sonicwall logs show nothing, and during one of the windows when it always dies, I unplugged their network from the at&amp;t circuit, plugged directly into it, and had no issues during that window. Next step is to setup a netflow monitor to PRTG and see what that shows, but just figured I&#x27;d bounce the issue on here to get any suggestions. Gut feeling (for whatever that&#x27;s worth) is that it&#x27;s an issue on the circuit that I&#x27;ll have to convince the isp about. According to the client, nothing has changed inside the network before this started, and the 5 minute windows every 2 hours make it a challenge to test theories and chasing down rabbit holes.

Searches on Mouser, digikey, etc. are all not really helping. I would appreciate anyone who can point to the exact model needed.
 I don&#x27;t care if its crimp, solder, bailing wire, whatever. Just need to get it booted soonish. Thanks!

 Does Cisco SD-WAN support in any way dynamic load balancing for &quot;Direct Internet Access&quot;?
 In a DIA scenario, can Cisco SD-WAN automatically distribute traffic to multiple lines in the event of packet loss or full utilization of one line? Are metrics such as packet loss, and round-trip delays measured in a Direct Internet Access scenario (if technically possible)?

 SOLVED: removing update wait-install and update wait-for-convergence removed the issue. (Since this is a container, the routes for the lo0 can never be in hardware, thus will never get advertised with these options.)
 (already posted this in /r/Arista, hope this is ok)
 I&#x27;ve recently wanted to spin up a quick evpn/vxlan lab with containerlab (all nodes running cEOS-lab 4.29.2F), however I&#x27;ve come across the issue that the loopback addresses are not advertised via bgp (from none of the switches), thus the VTEPs are not reachable. 
 P2P Links between DC1-SPINE1 and LEAFs will take a /30 out of 10.1.1.0/24 P2P Links between DC1-SPINE2 and LEAFs will take a /30 out of 10.1.2.0/24 MLAG Peer Links will take a /30 out of 10.1.3.0/24

 When watching different YouTube videos of people setting up their edgerouter x, they further tailored this router through its terminal to be more efficient with their use case. Honesty looked like black magic gibberish…
 I’m wondering if anybody has suggestions to make my network more efficient and dependable. Only thing I did outside of a standard/quick setup was hide my network name on the AP.
 Any suggestions and learning material are appreciated. Currently waiting for “introduction to show networking” by John Huntington.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not a networking pro of any kind. My org. will be hosting a meeting of roughly 100 people, and we&#x27;re here in Alaska, so we buy our data by the GB/TB. 
 Is there some way to guesstimate the amount of data use per person, like caterers do? (For example, they plan on 1/3 lb. of beef per person for tacos. 100 people, do the math, add 10%.) 
 If we go over cap, we get dropped to 10mbps, so that won&#x27;t do. 
 I have indeed tried to research this, but everything comes up with data info for Zoom meetings, etc.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am currently studying NETCONF and YANG data modeling, and so far, I am somewhat understanding creating filters to pull data. I can formulate a filter to request a container within the model, but I cannot figure out how to pull ALL containers at once, aka pulling the entire model&#x27;s worth of data.
 Can someone please assist me in understanding how to do this? For reference, I am using ncclient and the YANG model I am using is ietf-interfaces.yang.
 Thank you.
 Edit: To clarify, I know that in the XML filter, you can call all the containers in one go. However, assuming a YANG model with too many damn containers, I&#x27;d like to find a way to call them all at once in one short, simple filter.

                              <span>So when I learned to terminate cable, I only learned the basics on cat 5, (not even 5e) years ago.
 I just recently got back into the field and I got myself a spool of some NICE cable to have on hand, it&#x27;s Cat6a F/UTP, pure copper, solid 23 AWG, CMR. But it has a ground on the cable and I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it, I got a can of shielded cat6a ends from Amazon and I know it&#x27;s the wrong kind because it&#x27;s really hard to push the wire through and it dosent crimp well, what ends am I suppose to use? What am I supposed to do with the ground? It&#x27;s obviously supposed to terminate onto the connectors but there&#x27;s really no spot on them to do so, TIA

                              <span>Started at an IT Help Desk job without any certs, just had my BS - IT degree in progress on my resume. After taking a few IT courses and getting some experience I&#x27;m switching to one of these. It would be nice to get some insight from people in the field and which you see more beneficial in the future. Both degrees look great from my perspective so sorry for my ignorance.
 Computer Science was my 1st choice but I would have to take a term break to take Calculus and re-enter and I don&#x27;t see that being the play at this point, maybe a masters later, who knows.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a senior level engineer in the enterprise and I&#x27;ve come to a point where I don&#x27;t like how the standard career progression looks. Design and architecture doesn&#x27;t interest me and I don&#x27;t like the overhead that comes along with it. 
 I&#x27;m more interested in the details. Give me a problem with an application that nobody knows anything about requiring a reverse engineering deep-dive and I&#x27;ll eat it up. Solving complex problems at the micro level is something I&#x27;d like to pivot to.
 What are some things I could pivot to? TAC seems like the logical answer, but I&#x27;m not sure how the pay would stack up. Network-related product testing/QA was another that caught my eye, but few of those don&#x27;t require a software background. Any outside-the-box stuff I could look at?

 We have 7 Aruba switches operating as a VSF and wanted a LACP Trunk to two ports on the Watchguard.
 We then want all VLANs to run through the LACP Trunk from the Watchguard to the Aruba&#x27;s.

                              <span>Had another one of those &quot;Where the F*** is that patch cable THIS time?!?!?&quot; moments today while attempting to run down a broken fiber run...I hate being disorganized...like many, I have multiple &quot;universal&quot; bags with a bunch of things just dumped in them because they never have enough small pockets for good organization, and too many pockets big enough to swallow a Toughbook, and it seems like I always just end up dumping it all out looking for one adapter and spend the entire drive home wondering if I forgot to put something back..
 So curious if anyone has any good solutions for organizing a mess of fiber patches, copper patches, various adapters and vendor specific cables, etc. Not really looking for a tool bag for ALL of my crap, just organizing out all the various cables and cable adapters a tech carries in the field. Ideally I&#x27;d rather just have all my cabling and various adapters in one location, but I&#x27;m not 100% opposed to separating it out to fiber and copper related.

                              <span>I have a M370 Watchguard switch. Interfaces are configure in Mixed routing mode. I have an Trusted interface, it is actually 4 ports in a link aggregation, and a tagged Vlan interface in a different port for a different network. The both goes to the same switch. The link aggregation goes to the switch in access mode with all the ports in Vlan1. The VLan interface goes to a trunk port in that switch. I am trying to give access to the Trusted 1 to the Vlan interface (only some users but for the sake of the question lets says all).
 I created 4 policies TCP/UDP, from trusted to Vlan10, Vlan10 to trusted. and 2 same way for http and https since what is behind Vlan10 are cameras that I need to manage using browser. No matter what I do I do not manage to send or get traffic from or to the Vlan interface. I can ping the cameras from the wathcguard but that is it.

                              <span>Hi! I am not a network engineer by any stretch so this is mainly a high level question. 
 We are wanting to operate a popup wifi network for an outdoor event in a field. We have a basic idea of a design hardware wise and want to see if it’s even in the ballpark of where we need to be. We are wanting to keep the design value oriented since this will only be used for specific events. We want to support up to 5000 users with basic mobile phone usage over Wi-Fi. We have a 10gb fiber backhaul. 
 Mikrotik CCR2216 Router x 1
 Mikrotik CRS510 Switch x 1
 EnGenius Cloud ECS5512FP Switch x 2
 EnGenius ECW270 AP x 14 
 Would this cover our needs? We will have a 3rd party captive portal for authentication. This is for high level preliminary budgeting purposes. 
 Thanks!
 Edit:
 Thanks to those with constructive replies. We are definitely hiring a consultant and will have network engineers running the the show. This was a basic post to ask a question for a ballpark budgetary check. Should’ve posted this in the moronic question Monday or whatever it’s called.

                              <span>Anyone try to do a cpdl firmware upgrade on these devices? This afternoon, I tried twice with a failed due to corrupt image. 
 I downloaded the image and pushed it to the device, did an md5 verification and came back good. 
 I also tried issuing the upgrade command to R0 and then RP active with the same result. 
 I guess I can try redownloading the image and trying again but wanted to know if I’m missing something. Seems pretty straightforward though. 
 Not a major issue, just trying to clear a bug relating to power environment logs. I did upgrade to the latest gold star IOS-XE software beforehand. 
 Just looking to see if anyone experienced this.

                              <span>I have been running EVE-NG community edition for labs with cisco ios images for a couple months. I am overall very happy with the lab environment EVE provides. The one issue I have never been able to resolve is pasting in commands into the web browser CLI. It would save me quite a bit of time in my labs if I was able to copy and paste the initial device configurations directly into the web browser CLI (i.e. interface ip&#x27;s, device name, username/password etc.). I am able to use PuTTY to SSH into my devices from windows but this requires me to set up SSH on each device individually. Hoping someone has a quick solution that would save me time so I can focus on the core lessons of the labs.

 I think I have to use event manager but its not clear on how to do so.
 To make things more secure I would like to do this with public key auth, however I am not sure how to convert the cisco&#x27;s output for the rsa public key to something I can put into a authorized_key file for trust, does anyone have instructions on how to do this too?

                              <span>Im feeling really dumb about this question but i dont get the logic of my Tp Link Archer MR200v5. (SIM Card Router)
 I want to disable NAT, so that my firewall (IPFire/Fortigate) can do NAT. But I dont know how to configure it.
 When i disable NAT, i dont get the public IP on my firewall via DHCP, manually doesnt work neighter. Using PPPOE/DialUp and all that doesnt make sense neighter, because the router shows that he is already connected and has a public IP Adress, even when i disable NAT, so why should the firewall dial in when the router already did that
 So where is my error in my brain or in my configuration
 I just want my firewalls to get my only public ip adress so i can block certain countries for hosting

                              <span>Small, private, K12 One Man Show here. Long history in SOHO env. First and only job not in SOHO.
 I recently picked up a pair of used managed switches (TP-Link T1600G-28PS) for 1/4 the price of new ones. We have all TP-Link managed switches, so I&#x27;m planning ahead now.
 So, I go to test them; it boots up just fine and loads the web UI. Just like I&#x27;m used to, except this one is super quiet. Then I realize...the fans are off. Not low, they&#x27;re O-F-F. Is that normal and to be expected? Did I just not notice the others doing this in the din of our &quot;MDF&quot;?
 I&#x27;ve seen a few machines running with no fans: I have an EdgeRouter (fan-less) at home and an arsenal of Raspberry Pis. But I&#x27;ve never seen this level of equipment running with no fans.
 So, should I be concerned? Does they need to be repaired or replaced? I&#x27;m not in tune with the thermodynamics (heat management) of network equipment. Please advise.
 FWIW, if I put these in production, they could potentially be feeding power to a few SIP phones and IP cameras (max 5W for both devices).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard that unexpected things can happen when changing to higher link speeds, and now I&#x27;m experiencing it first hand. We&#x27;ve been transitioning from the c4500 series to c9400 chassis, and haven&#x27;t had a single link issue until recently, when we started installing c9400&#x27;s with 5 gig boards, specifically C9400-LC-48HN, running XE version 17.6.4(MD) on the SUP-1XL. 
 There have been over 10 instances where a Windows NIC (almost always Intel I219-LM network card) fails to connect, but after switching cables and wall jacks a few times, the link decides to come up. These NICs can always connect immediately if there is a hub, unmanaged switch or even a shark tap in between the host and the switch (when I tried to do a packet capture with the tap, I couldn&#x27;t replicate &amp; analyze the problem).

                              <span>We’re desperately looking for a network person. Thankfully I’ll be involved in hiring this round. I’m looking for tried and true questions/tasks that you’ve used that will at least let us know if this person is the real deal. 
 Aside from conventional tech questions I’m also looking for something a bit challenging that will gauge someone’s work ethic (our last hire was abysmal at this). Honestly I’m more ok with someone who has more room to grow but will take charge / be reliable than someone who has (claims) vast knowledge but thinks certain tasks are beneath them.

I can ping the management interface from all the other switches, as well as the computer in the same rack. But no GUI will pull up. Any ideas? We will be onsite next week, but it would be nice to configure it before we get there. Thanks for any suggestions.

                              <span>Sorting IP addresses in Excel creates results in situations where 100.0.0.1 will come before 20.0.0.1 because they are treated as text and 1 comes before 2. All the research I&#x27;ve done points to having to split the IP into four columns, sorting them, and recombining them as the only way to get Excel to realize that 20 comes before 100. This would work fine for a static document but for a living one, it quickly becomes a problem.
 Does anyone have a tip or trick to get it to sort IPs correctly without resorting to the process described above or use a program they can recommend that is similar to Excel but knows how to sort them correctly?
 Edit: Thank you for all of the input. I think I need to research some IPAMs now to see if any of those will work for what I&#x27;m needing to do.

 I wanted to see if anyone had any reccomendations for a router that does well with BGP (currently we have an ISR-4451-X and are looking to upgrade and stick with Cisco (due to our service support and contracts). This router will only handle North and South traffic as an aggregation of multiple service providers. Below is the one that I had found and though could be a good idea but let me know!

I found that it&#x27;s buggy sometimes. E.g sometimes if i have subinterfaces configured i get no arp entries or unable to ping across the network.I have to reboot the nodes and they might work. If i use the bare interfaces they work fine. I tried the same images in eve but it seems to be the same. Anyone with a working alternative or any ideas?

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I&#x27;m struggling to find a concise answer from google so thought I would ask here.
 Is RSTP Switch brand dependent? I have an SMB site where we want to swap out the switches currently running most of their network for new Zyxel Models w/PoE which seem to work well for us and have easy and quick config changes via mobile app - I am then looking to move the existing switches D-Link&#x27;s over to their server cabinet for use here and wanted to use RSTP so if i lose a link between any of the switches in the loop it would be able to get round the other way. 
 I&#x27;ve had this running fine on a single brand of switches but is it possible between different switch brands? I&#x27;m looking to keep the older switches to save on costs
 Thanks

                              <span>In my design, I have filtered an IP address from some routers using route-map command, and so when I ping this address from a source router, I am sure that the request traffic does not pass through the filtered routers (Routing protocol is OSPF). However, the reply traffic may pass through the filtered routers yet. How can I avoid this situation without filtering the source IP address in the routers?

                              <span>If one single ip is advertised via BGP from multiple peers with equal AD/COST and in the routing table all routes are showing (AKA ECMP) how the packets will be forwared in this case?
 say for eg:
  
 192.168.12.20 is reachable via 192.168.5.1-&gt; node1 
  
  192.168.10.2-&gt; node2 
   192.168.3.4-&gt; node3 
 
 will the packets be forwared in RR?
 Is it better to do load balance between nodes this way or use external load balancer like LVS/CITRIX ADC/ F5-BIGip ?
 In my case RR will do just fine.

                              <span>Hi, I have several switches given to me by a friend after his company closed.
 Most of them are POE switches, managed and unmanaged, different brands.
 How can I test them correctly under load? I used iperf bandwidth test on a port by port basis, let the bandwidth test run for a few minutes but that didn&#x27;t work as espected as I did found a switch on wich the ports get stuck when 6 or more devices get connected.
 Is there a way to properly test switches? And POE on then

That&#x27;s what i&#x27;m thinking, or do i need 4 individual certs on each firewall?

                              <span>Forgive me, it&#x27;s late and I will do my best to collect my thoughts after 30 hours of non stop troubleshooting: 
 About 6 months ago I took over about 10 full racks of HPC, NAS, and a variety of servers performing varying tasks at a datacenter in Southern California.
 Now before you bust out the flamethrowers, I understand NIS is insecure; but I&#x27;ve taken on this project and I&#x27;ve been working on a FreeIPA replacement.. In the meantime everything continues to function well, till last Friday.
 Last Friday I get a call from one of the research professors mentioning that access to the HPC has gone down. I check and see that the NIS client on the HPC cluster can no longer communicate with the NIS server. So I do some tests:

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m curious as to how you guys go about setting up WiFi in dense high rise buildings?
 Ive got a office 1 of 3 on a middle floor and the WiFi spectrum is just saturated, from what I can tell everyone side to side and above and below are all set to auto so everything I just jumping all over the place. 
 What&#x27;s best practice to actually set up my office to be as resilient as I can? As it is people get occasional drop outs (enough to kill a teams call). 
 I&#x27;ve got 3x Meraki MR18&#x27;s (I know theyre old I&#x27;ve asked for new stuff but I&#x27;m not holding my breathe) to work with any suggestions would be appreciated.

                              <span>What is everyone’s take on the best domain registrar to use. I’ve heard the big common things to avoid sites such as GoDaddy, Domain Dot Com, etc. I’ve heard good things about Namecheap, Porkbun, and Google Domains.
 I was just curious what everyone else thought about the best place to purchase and setup domains on.

                              <span>Hopefully this will save time for others.
 We recently started rolling out Surface Laptop 5 to our staff, replacing old models. Almost immediately staff started complaining about USB devices (keyboard/mouse/whatever) disconnecting at random times or not working at all.
 We spent one month troubleshooting to the point that we stopped any further purchases while working with Microsoft support.
 The issue turns out to be SentinelOne. 
 Scenario:
  
Device with Intel Smart Sound Technology for USB Audio – affects ALL Surface Laptop 5, but not 4 – probably it needs to be a specific hardware.
 S1 with Device Control enabled – it just needs to be enabled, no rules needed – We can reproduce with agent version 22.1 , 22.2 and 22.3
 Users plugs in a USB device that interact with the audio subsystem, directly to the USB port of to a USB hub, connected to the laptop, which would include : webcams, headsets, etc…
 All USB devices connected to the laptop (whether USB hub, USB hub through a dock, or directly), crash and disconnect, sometime the laptop may bluescreen or freeze.
 Uninstalling S1 agent immediately fixes the behaviour
 To workaround the issue and allow S1 agent to be installed, we had to add the following override, in S1 console under settings-policy override
  
​
 {
 &quot;deviceControl&quot;: {
 &quot;excludedDeviceSetupClasses&quot;: [
 &quot;{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}&quot;
 ]
 }
 }
 ​
  
the 4d36 etc is the GUID Class ID of the Intell SST USB interface, you can grab it by right clicking on the device in device manager.
 Change will immediately apply, no restart needed, to all devices in the scope where you configured the policy override.
  
​
 I have passed all these info to S1 support so they hopefully can release new version of the agent.

                              <span>Just like the title says, I&#x27;m seeing this weird &quot;bug&quot;(?) on about half of my Win 10 systems. My patch management hasn&#x27;t updated them to 22H2 yet, which I thought was strange. After doing manual update checks, I am able to get 22H2 to appear 100% of the time, only after clicking &quot;Stay on windows 10 for now&quot;. It will not show available until win 11 is declined via the banner in the &quot;check for updates&quot; window. I don&#x27;t have any GP&#x27;s enforcing versions. Has anyone else seen this or found a workaround?

 If I were MS I would feel embarrassed. It&#x27;s a virtual certainty that any of the folks on this subreddit know more about their product than their first few levels of support. But since they&#x27;re the gatekeepers under some circumstances, you&#x27;re left with no choice but to suffer through days of aimless questions. 
 The language barrier in some cases for me is to the point where I can&#x27;t even understand what&#x27;s being asked of me.
 It&#x27;s just a deeply frustrating experience. For one of the largest corporations in the world, they should be able to do much better on the support side of their business.

                              <span>Been digging on this for a bit and can&#x27;t find a straight answer.
 Our quarantine policy allows for end users to release emails from quarantine, but I was wondering if this is still submitting them for machine learning to improve the system.
 What made me question this was noticing that the end user doesn&#x27;t have the option to &quot;Report to Microsoft to improve detection&quot; like an admin does when they release an email.
 End users do have the option &quot;Report message as having no threats&quot; but they are still getting multiple quarantines from the same domain and senders.
 Obviously I can whitelist the domains/senders/IPs in Policies and Rules, but this lead me to wonder are the end user releases actually sending data to machine learning?

 We&#x27;ve inherited an environment with a PowerVault MD3800i. We installed a few new drives in it (model MG03SCA400) that are listed in Dell&#x27;s Support Matrix
 Using MDSM, the drives are seen but theirStatus and Mode are both listed as &quot;Incompatible&quot;.
 My first instinct is that this is because they&#x27;re on firmware version 0108 while DG09 is what is supported.
 The trouble is, I can&#x27;t get the new firmware onto them! I go to Upgrade&gt;Physical Disk Firmware, and choose the file, which MDSM does say that it&#x27;s compatible with them. 
 Then I try to load it onto these drives it returns Error 249 - failed because they are bypassed/offline. (Incidentally I tried this in Online/All/Parallel modes)
 So unless I&#x27;m missing something it looks like a catch-22; I can&#x27;t upload the firmware because the firmware is out of date.

                              <span>So I got approached by someone who wants me to come work for them. The pay is going to be more, the estate is probably 10x’s bigger than my current place, and it’s a spin off from a huge company. So it’s sorta like a startup in the way that the tech is all shiney and new. No legacy stuff at all. 
 I love my current job. We are also shiney and new and since we are way smaller, I’m well known by everyone, even the C-Suite. They know the names of my wife and kids and always ask about them when they see me. I’m also respected and one of the leaders others seek out. 
 The team is siloed into 5 parts at the new place and I will be leading one of the silos but will take part in the other areas. Today, I do all 5 parts and do them well. So I’ll be less focused on those other areas. Also my work load is insanely easy at my current place. I can work 60 hours one week and maybe 40 minutes other weeks. I can come and go as I please at my current place, my boss doesn’t care what I do. The people at my current place are also some of the smartest people I’ve got to work with. And I have known and worked with these people (holy shit this just occurred to me when I did the math) for MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE! 
 I’m really torn here. Any thoughts from people who have been in this situation?
 Edit: A couple of the posts here answered the question. This post could tend to get a lot of responses so I’m going to stick with the current gig. I’ve been here since I was a teenager (buy outs, ipos, spin-offs). I haven’t had a real interview in 25 years so I’m going to get to the end of the interview process at this new place and kindly decline. I don’t want to burn bridges.

                              <span>I am curious as to what other sysadmins are doing to keep their windows networks all in sync. 
 Lately, more and more I am seeing domain joined hosts that just will not sync their time from a domain controller for love nor money.
 In most of these cases the time source becomes &quot;Local CMOS&quot;
 I have tried multiple guides online and usually what I end up doing is giving up and setting an NTP server on the workstation side which is not ideal 
 Does anyone have any sort of SOP for doing this, or any advice on best practice?
 Thanks
 Edit: thanks for all the comments people I will go through all these suggestions. Seems more complicated than it needs to be generally.

                              <span>I need advice. I am two years into my IT career at 24 years old currently a Sr Sysadmin at a medium size company with 150 employees. We recently had a cyber attack, which resulted in my beloved director leaving and going to a bigger international company, because he received a lot of push back from upper management and the engineering staff with us doing basic things such as patching and upgrading systems to newer OS&#x27;s which lead to the attack. My old director offered me a job at the new company starting at 85k a year with a 18kish bonus yearly managing their virtual environment, backups, and storage, the caveat is I would have an hour commute each way 5 days a week for 6 months before going hybrid, and it sounded like that date might get pushed back more.

                              <span>I’ve been getting interviews, with startups, mid size corporations and even Amazon. Some of these manage to go past the initial phone screen and to the hiring manager. I even had one where I talked to an executive. 
 What am I doing wrong? Is it due to the market? I admit that I know Azure, AD, Office 365 and have used Windows server but don’t have advanced knowledge, especially of server backups. I have 2 years of work experience, a Business IT Management degree and am studying for Network plus.
 How can I conduct myself in interviews better? I do dress up in an office shirt with a tie.

                              <span>This past week I&#x27;ve suddenly had 5 laptops flagged for hard drive usage exceeding 95%. Turns out it was the same issue for every one. Something was up with the Windows System Protection and Restore settings. The disk space usage was set to 100% which in turn filled up the entire drive. 
 Solution: Run &gt; sysdm.cpl &gt; System Protection tab &gt; Configure button &gt; Delete all restore points and move the slider down to something lower (I&#x27;ve been choosing 10%). No restart required, but not a bad idea to do one. 
 I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s causing it. Just thought I would post something in case others ran into it :)
 EDIT - /u/SauceAdmin noted this potentially being a Dell issue specifically with the SupportAssist app: https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12pi2im/suddenly_workstations_have_95_full_hard_drives/jgmjgg7/

                              <span>Hey guys and girls. Hope you&#x27;re all doing fine! 
 How you handle with Accounts in Windows Devices to remote workers? The device is sent with a local Admin account and a Work account (to the user)? Or only Work account?
 Which one may be the best approach?
 We&#x27;ll use Intune (AAD Joined) with Microsoft 365 accounts (Work Account) to the remote users. 
 The computer will be sent by a service provider, so I&#x27;ll not have access to configure it by myself before received by the employee. 
 Thanks :)

We have resolved issues with vendors that support DKIM signing and DMARC, however some vendors just flat out don&#x27;t support it. Before DKIM and DMARC we were able to allow these emails through just with basic mail flow rules.
 Service Fusion for example is a vendor that doesn&#x27;t seem to support it (https://dmarc.io/source/service-fusion/). How do you deal with these particular vendors? I have suggested to my service manager to use the default domain (as opposed to using our domain), however he&#x27;s wondering why we can&#x27;t leave it the way it&#x27;s always been.
 From his perspective, our &quot;enhancements&quot; to our email security are a step backwards for him and his department. He&#x27;s requesting us to revert our changes (which we&#x27;re not interested in doing). It seems to me like the obvious way to proceed is to use the out of the box domain instead of trying to spoof our domain without proper DKIM and DMARC, but I was just interested what the community&#x27;s opinion is on this?

                              <span>I am deploying (badly) the Unreal Engine to several classrooms of Windows PCs, 100+ machines. The main hurdle here is the size of the Unreal Engine assets (36GB compressed, 122GB decompressed).
 I have a roughly 20-30 minute window in the evening when I can perform this task via a shutdown script. This shutdown task can be split over multiple reboots so its not essential that the action take place in one run, as long as I can gracefully pick up where it left off on the previous reboot. You may ask, why dont you extend the shutdown time out on the script, I could, but I am managing an estate of 4000 PC&#x27;s, I dont want to make a fundamental change to the other ~3900 just for these 100.
 ​
 The machines are all of a similar spec (decent Intel i5&#x27;s, miniumum of 8GB RAM, SSD drives etc), network…</span>

                              <span>Is there anyway to lock the UAC so that no one can play with it? I have a GPO setup to force it to L3 but you can still open it and play around with the slider until you reboot. I just want to see if it can be locked (greyed out) so nothing can be touched until the GPO unlocks it?

 I am doing some very preliminary research on a couple tools but am not ready to do demos yet. Not looking for recommendations for other tools either.
 Anyone willing to share recent pricing on these? I know that these are not all exactly in the same bucket, but they seem to have some carryover for what we are doing with ITOps and SecOps.
  
Tanium (I hear its pricy...but what does pricy mean?)
 Tenable
 Ivanti
 Automox (just for patching)
  
Thanks in advance! I really appreciate any insight you can provide! 
 edit: Realized I was spelling Ivanti wrong. Too late in the title. :P

                              <span>We are noticing a recent spate of phishing attempts that are bypassing Microsoft safe link URL rewrites simply by leaving off the &quot;http&quot; prefix of URLs. The email clients still are translating the URL to a hyperlink but it becomes unprotected. I opened up a case about it. 
 Has anyone seen this, or do you have a workaround? I am a bit surprised that it can be bypassed so easily and wonder if something changed.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just deployed three new server 2022 vms (foo, bar, quux). Normally they&#x27;d all auto-register their DNS with the domain controllers and so I&#x27;d be able to access them using \foo, \bar, \quux etc.
 For some reason, in this case this hasn&#x27;t happened. There&#x27;s no entry put into AD&#x27;s DNS server for these systems.
 If I go on to one of them and try to ping the others, it works, but using an ipv6 address.
 If I disable ipv6 then try ping again, it works, but it says the target system name is &#x27;
.local&#x27;
 This was a standard deployment of server 2022 using MDT and in Feb I deployed machines the same way and they worked fine.
 Does anyone have any idea what might be going on?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Are there any Windows update management solutions that provide comparable control and visibility to WSUS, but don&#x27;t require line of sight to a server in order for clients to update? Windows Update for Business policies are very generic and not a WSUS replacement.
 What I mean by comparable control and visibility to WSUS is:
  
For every update, you can see which computers have installed, not installed, failed install, or are pending reboot to install it.
 You can make groups out of computers to report on and control
 Each update is explicitly approved by you (or a script/criteria you built) for each group, and under no circumstances can Microsoft push anything to clients without your permission.
 Drivers can be included if you&#x27;re willing to deal with them on this level, or excluded and done automatically.
  
I don&#x27;t like having to choose between control and visibility and the risk of remote users who don&#x27;t use the VPN enough being outdated, or them just not being managed at all.

 Do I have the job, since I interviewed with the executive? I heard it’s a very good sign

                              <span>First time post, so please be kind!
 I am going through an upgrade program in our enviroment. We currently have a mix of 2008 R2 and 2012R2 servers. I am going to be building new servers to replace them.
 Is it ok to add a 2022 member server to a 2008 domain? Should I build the new 2022 DC first?
 ​
 Thank you!

 I have a client who has the following &quot;problem&quot;:
 There are 16 printers in a remote location that need to be connected and available to print on demand via the internet. Printers would be connected via Wi-Fi to a central router/modem.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a router/modem and printer combination that can facilitate this job?
 Best regards

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve got Azure AD Connect setup and running ok. It syncs our local user accounts to cloud.
 I now want to start using O365 for pwd reset and need Azure AD Connect to sync the passwords from cloud to premises. 
 Azure AD app has Password hash synchronisation and Password writeback enabled.
 I’ve tried to reset a test account’s password but the password is not syncing back to premises. I can use the new password in O365, but can’t login to PC unless using old pwd.
 Synchronisation Service Manager shows latest sync and I can see the results user properties, and lastPasswordChange is howling as none.
 Any ideas on where to look?
 Many thanks in advance

 This post seems a bit ridiculous but ive never ran into this issue before and cant seem to figure it out. Ive got a virtual network set up in vmware and my AD and database machines just keep shutting down when left unattended. All the power settings i can identify have been changed to turn off - never but it keeps doing it. I feel silly asking but im stumped, any tips would be appreciated

 For the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why it fails to cast to smart tv&#x27;s in the office and a Microsoft adapter, I know it uses the same technology. WIFI.
 This is what i&#x27;ve found out.
 - Casting to smart TV&#x27;s on laptops that are not domain joined and not on the wifi *WORK*
 - Trying to cast from domain joined laptops fails or buffers endlessly
 - Disconnecting from the company domain WIFI also fails from a domain joined laptop.
 ​
 So it seems the issue isn&#x27;t down to the network configuration but down to a laptop being domain joined.
 Does anyone else have any idea what to look at/check/do?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve come for your help once again /r/sysadmin 
 In preparation of migrating to Win11, and also because of general security, I am in the midst of moving our 802.1x authentication from PEAP to EAP-TLS. I am stuck on an issue that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out despite reading documentation, watching tutorials etc. 
 I have a Computer group that i&#x27;ll call EAPTLS-group and a computer that I&#x27;ll call Computer1, that is a member of EAPTLS-group. I have set up NPS policys for ethernet, using smartcard of other certificate and enrolled the certificate used so that it is visible on Computer1. Being a member of EAPTLS-group is a requirement. The CA is the same as the NPS server. 
 GPO is set to:
 Autoenroll certificate and renew certs based on templates
 &quot;SmartCard or other certificate&quot; network auth method
 &quot;Computer Only&quot; auth mode
 Selected certificate issuer as well as trusted root CA&#x27;s
 defined what server to connect to for NPS
 ​
 GPO is applied to:
 OU that Computer1 is placed in
 Authenticated users (also tried security filtering EAPTLS-group but that made no difference)
 ​
 To the issue:
 When trying to connect the NPS security logs say that for Computer1: &quot;The Network Access Permission setting in the dial-in properties of the user account in Active Directory is set to Deny access to the user. To change the Network Access Permission setting to either Allow access or Control access through NPS Network Policy, obtain the properties of the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers, click the Dial-in tab, and change Network Access Permission&quot; 
 This is not true, as it is set to Control access through NPS 
 Any ideas as to what might be happening? My apologies if I&#x27;m being unclear, I&#x27;m happy to specify 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been really healthy until I started a standing job 4 months ago. Despite the fact that I work only 4h a day (while my colleagues work 8h a day and they are all healthy) my legs and feet don&#x27;t function like they would anymore. My feet can&#x27;t hold me and I feel the pressure in the nerves of the metatarsal area. It&#x27;s so painful and is causing foot deformation. Besides I had episodes of very painful legs, and blue veins (not swollen) I could see through the skin of my legs. I tried compression socks and they work wonders, but I can never go back to be default settings, a.k.a healthy legs. Am I experiencing early symptoms of deep vein thrombosis/blood clotting? Can this be just cause I am pearshaped and most of my weight is in my lower body? Please help me with any advice, thank you!

 Recently a regkey &quot;NoAutoRebootwithLoggedOnUsers&quot; was set to zero in order to let the PCs to reboot themselves automatically at the scheduled install date/time. It works as expected except that they got stuck at the bitlocker screen.
 My question is, is it a default behaviour that bitlocker is not suspended for Windows patch installation and reboot?

                              <span>We are considering rebuilding our Windows Server Datacenter Hyper-V hypervisors from 2019 to 2022.
 Our VMs are Server 2019, a few Windows 10, several Linux Ubuntu. We are also contemplating move all or most 2019 servers to 2022.
 To be clear - on the hypervisors we will move VMs to other hosts, wipe an reinstall, and move the VMs back . We will not do an in place upgrade.
 I am interested in your experiences if you have done any of this.
  
What is better?
 
What is worse?
 
What issues, major and minor, have you encountered?
 
 Thanks

 I&#x27;ve got loads of information gathering scripts thanks to TSSv2 on Microsoft/github 
 as our devices are not on the domain and intune and don&#x27;t have rights to poershell via endpoint manager, and with quick assist being an ass just now, It dawned on me how awful it would be to try and tell a user how to do something over the phone, anyway here&#x27;s 2 I just used 
 Any and all suggestions or if someone has a link to a complied list of end user scripts that would be handy! 
 try also this script to clear your temp files - Script to clear cache and temporary files on Windows devices - Hexnode Help Center

 I asked in MS support community and some suggested that account for work are not supported in win11

 ​
 Got an Outlook issue that I cannot solve, so thought I&#x27;d put it to the hive mind.
 We are running Windows 10/11. Server 2019/2022, Office 365 and unfortunately Roaming Profiles (I know, I know, but this isn&#x27;t changing anytime soon)
 We have a .vbs file that get user info from AD (On Prem) and runs via a logon script in GP to add a group of signatures to Outlook (It contains 4 different signatures as our company has 4 different entities)
 When we logon with a new user, this .vbs script does it&#x27;s thing as it should but it tries to open Outlook 2016 (Note we are using 365) and tries to connect to an Exchange server which we no longer have, to be able to load the users emails.
 Everytime, I have to cancel this process, the run the actual Outlook (365) to get the user into their emails
 Anyone got any idea how I can stop this happening? I have set up a new user on AD using folder redirection rather than a Roaming Profile and it loads normally, I just have to logoff and back on to be able to view the signatures in Outlook 365
 ​
 If anyone could shed any light it would be appreciated.

 i&#x27;m stuck with an old Cisco C420 running a flash/js ipmi and none of the browser extensions i found are able to make it work. Anyone found a tool to access it or a way to replace the embed ipmi ?

                              <span>I’m using Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) and it’s letting too many spam messages through. I hoped that upgrade to spamassassin 4 would make a difference, but nope.
 So I’m looking for options for a gateway solution and what I gather is that rspamd seems to be great. But is there a portal/product that it can be interfaced with so users can review, block and allow?
 Another big downer for PMG is that it’s not at all mobile friendly, something essential in this day and age.

                              <span>Hey,
 So I got an email from Microsoft recently. Subject &quot;Migrate to the Authentication methods policy in Azure Active Directory by 30 September 2024&quot;.
 And I wanted to try following the instructions and try it in a small tenant of around 10 people, that I very sporadically give support to, before doing the same on other tenants.
 MFA and SSPR were already setup before. No Conditional Access available (only using M365 Business Standard).
 The instructions on this page are pretty good and easy to follow. Essentially, I enabled and configured the methods that were being used before in either MFA or SSPR.
 I do have a doubt though. At the end of article, it says:
  
Finish the migration 
 After you update the Authentication methods policy, go through the legacy MFA, and SSPR policies and remove each authentication method one-by-one. Test and validate the changes for each method.
  
So I followed through and cleared all the methods and saved successfully.
  
MFA service settings - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
 Password reset | Authentication methods - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
  
​
 My question is:
 In the new policy (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/kV4xITt.png ), where is it being defined which methods are available to users willing to self reset their password ? This was very easy to understand in the previous &quot;Password reset | Authentication methods&quot; page but now I&#x27;m a little bit confused.
 ​
 Edit: cleared text, added new screenshots.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in IT for almost 20 years now since leaving university and looking for my next role and relaised I have a huge lack of professional qualifications which is hampering my search. Currently I run the IT systems years for a small finance company in London (35 people), and I&#x27;ve been there over 6 years now. While I like the variety, challenge and autonomy, things like professional development and training haven&#x27;t been forthcoming which has left me with no recent professional qualifications.
 My CV currently only lists ITIL Foundation v3 as a professional certification, which is now woefully out of date, but I feel like at least ITIL hasn&#x27;t changed that much. I have however, made the choice to omit all of MS certifcations from 10 years ago as it really doesn&#x27;t look great to have things like Server 2008 and SQL 2012 listed given how dated they are now.
 So my question is this, given that my free time is limited like most people, which are the best certifications to get which are fairly short 1-2 day courses and fairly cheap, while also providing good prospects for future roles, and a good line to have on my CV and LinkedIn. Ideally in the realms of cyber security, change management and the Azure Cloud.
 My initial thoughts are
 Cyber Essentials
 ISO 27001
 MS Partner courses in the more advanced areas of Azure Load balancing and cloud server migration.
 Maybe looking into upgrading to ITIL v4
 Change management courses
 ​
 I would love some feedback and suggestions, thanks!

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have taken over the responsibility to secure our hardware setup, and as it is right now it is all just a bunch of computers in 12 different stores and 2 offices + 70 laptops users can loan.
 Most of the pc&#x27;s are used as Cash registers. 
 My plan was to do the following:
  
TeamViewer on all computers for easy support
 TeamViewer Monitor to secure pc&#x27;s are up to date and secure
 SpiceWorks agent for Inventory
 Create Admin account on all pc&#x27;s and create a user account for the users
  
How would you all handle this?

 I wrote free little tool to do some DNS auditing and have just recently added Whois information. I’d love to get some feedback on it and to see if it is useful for anyone.

                              <span>I have a managerial request to somehow populate everyone&#x27;s personal Outlook calendar with public holidays as well as mandatory shutdown periods (Christmas time I guess). This will need to automatically fill any new user&#x27;s calendar.
 It&#x27;s essentially controlling items in other people&#x27;s calendars which I don&#x27;t think is possible. Ttelling everyone to just hit the Holiday button in Options doesn&#x27;t cut it. I&#x27;ve tried creating and sending an all day event to my test calendar but it doesn&#x27;t prevent the recipient from hitting the Decline button. It&#x27;s also nothing short of cumbersome.
 I don&#x27;t think there is a practical solution, but there might be other methods I haven&#x27;t thought of. So... open to ideas if anyone has attempted this.

                              <span>Hope all are well,
 ​
 I&#x27;ll start by explaining the dilemma I&#x27;m currently facing;
 I have a client who has slightly under 1 million folders/files in a single SharePoint site.
 They have had syncing issues for a fair bit of time now. Syncing from the explorer to the cloud
 can take anywhere from 5minutes-1 hour (sometimes many more or not at all).
 ​
 I have tested with a brand new SharePoint site with instant syncing (just to confirm it has nothing to do with the environment).
 ​
 Anyway, so my question is how common is 1 single SharePoint site for the entire business? How many files is technically &quot;too many&quot; regardless of what MS claims it can handle.
 I&#x27;m planning on rebuilding the SharePoint structure into individual sites per folder below;
 Jobs
 Quotes
 Projects
 Accounting
 Management
 Etc.
 ​
 I know I&#x27;m not Houdini and this is standard but it&#x27;ll lead up to my second question;
 I&#x27;m having a hell of a time splitting the files since I keep reaching &quot;File count over limit&quot;.
 Any PowerShell scripts that have worked for you guys moving larger folders?
 I have tried a few different scripts but to no avail unfortunately.
 ​
 Any tricks would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>APT28 accesses poorly maintained Cisco routers and deploys malware on unpatched devices using CVE-2017-6742.
Overview and Context
The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US National Security Agency (NSA), US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint advisory to provide details of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28’s exploitation of Cisco routers in 2021.

                              <span>Hey all, so I’m trying to figure out this issue. So far a small group of users (2 or 3) are experiencing freezing whenever they receive an email via Outlook or Teams. We’re running M365 with exchange online. The freeze lasts roughly as long as the desktop notification then stops. We switched to M365 roughly 6 months ago, and this issue happened within the past 2 weeks. Now one thing thst happened was thst the feature preview caused the app bar at the bottom of the nav lane to move to the left side. That and us switching to FS Logix to replace roaming profiles are the only real changes that I know of. As far as troubleshooting goes I’ve disabled notifications for anything to show on desktop, rebuilt the local profile, rebuilt the outlook profile, disabled the updated apps bar, and no dice. I have not noticed this on the physical machine, only when removing via Citrix storefront to use RDP, or use the Citrix Desktop. We’re using on prem AD, Citrix VDA to support multiple users to one server, I’m one of the users effected. If anyone has any ideas or needs any clarification I am an open book ask me and I’ll answer. Thank you all for your help!!

 I got an account which is Google Workspace Business Starter. This gives me 30gb per user. In the past, if a user needed 100gb or more, in the storage section, the account could be upgraded for an extra amount per month or year. Google has killed off this feature.
 The only way forward is upgrading to Workspace business standard, which gives a 2Tb pooled storage. However, this also doubles the user/month cost, which does not sit well with the board. (Moving the whole business off the Google account is a nightmare I don&#x27;t really want to face). 
 What other external storage options do you guys use? 
 Basically external storage, cloud or self hosted, not looking at OneDrive or Dropbox, as I&#x27;m hoping there is something that would be possible to integrate with Google drive.

                              <span>I have a Cisco switch that is trunked to ExtremeNetworks AP acting as a vcontroller. I have 2 SSID&#x27;s ,while connecting to them,I get correct ip address from DHCP but I lose internet connectivity after a while. Is this due to something related to vlan tagging?because when I give SSID the native vlan everything seems to be working fine. Any suggestions are appreciated. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Final update: https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1647774237896368130?t&#x3D;45eqpJBOf1MxgNRwA_djZQ&amp;s&#x3D;19
 @Netflix: To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned. We&#x27;re filming it now and we&#x27;ll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.
 Love is Blind is doing a live event. ~Apparently this is their first live event / episode.~ this is not the first live event.
 Servers are down, no one can connect. They communicated 15 minutes until online and now it&#x27;s been 20.
 Oof.
 Update: 28 minutes in and still down
 Update 2: 43 minutes in, still down. The hosts posted an update on Instagram saying they&#x27;re working on it still
 Update 3: 57 minutes in, still down. Maybe they have an internal go live at 6pm pst, one hour in?
 Update 4: 62 minutes in, still down. We&#x27;re in this for the long haul. This is bad lmao especially since they have the cast there just awkwardly waiting until they can stream it live
 Update 5: 75 minutes in, still down. All influencers are now streaming from their Instagram accounts and it looks like chaos
 Update 6: POSSIBLE FIX: PLAY THE EPISODE 12 AND FAST FORWARD TO THE ENDING. THEN ITLL SAY NEXT EPISODE AND PLAY
 Update 7: Well, it played for about 2 minutes live and then crashed again
 I was able to get in after 86 minutes. Now I can&#x27;t get in again. Some people are streaming it off their phone on TikTok and IG
 apparently Netflix canceled the live stream and they&#x27;re just recording it to post later. Not sure how true this is but it seems it is, they&#x27;re going ahead with the event. 
 Back to just loading

                              <span>I am nearing 4,5 years at my current job. It is getting tiresome. We are a small company with a boss with too big an ego. Why? As we are a cloud provider, I must do nearly everything you can imagine. So networking, backup, virtualization, storage, web, Linux, windows, mail, web servers, and the list goes on and on. It is like I do something new every day, even after more than 4 years, it is like I never get to the point I can say, yes, now I am really good at this topic. Besides this I am also doing other jobs here, non-IT related.
 My boss, now, came to the brilliant idea we can also do pen-testing as well. Just like that. Without some outside training. Just search how and do it. Not to mention he also ****** over employees if they leave.
 Oh and the hours, some months they seem without end. Like now...migrate exchange to some open source software. Search, try, implement, test, troubleshoot, document, etc.
 I am getting tired. Next week it is possible I will receive an offer, Linux job, a bit less pay, but better benefits.
 I am also afraid to change, Stockholm syndrome?
 I am tired.

                              <span>Long story very short. I&#x27;ve been a sysadmin since around 1995 in various sectors, even in the past 10 years when I moved into cybersec I&#x27;ve still been in charge of huge chunk of our infrastucture as this was seen as an advantage when we had any incidents - I was familiar with it.
 I&#x27;m moving into a new role in May and while is almost triple my current salary I can&#x27;t help but feel nervous as it&#x27;s completely focused on cybersec, I&#x27;ve taken the jump as frankly I can&#x27;t work under my new boss who&#x27;s just a disaster waiting to happen.
 Any tips? I think it&#x27;s likely impostor syndrome, I was headhunted for this role so I&#x27;m trying to see that as a vote of confidence.
 Perhaps some of this is guilt, since I put my notice in my entire team have quit or are working their notice too so we&#x27;ll be leaving my current employer without a cyber sec team at all (8 staff gone in &lt;2 months).

                              <span>Edit: This post is geared towards those working in Government with air gapped networks.
 I noticed after upgrading to Windows 11 22H2 from Windows 10 20H2/21H2 some vulnerabilities (Nessus) appeared for apps like 3D viewer, Paint 3D and the new Windows Terminal. This is because these are Microsoft Store Apps that require updates.
 If you&#x27;re in an air-gapped environment this proves difficult as everything points to GitHub, third party sites, or a license to get an Appx installer for offline networks. It&#x27;s possible to update these apps but if your workplace is very hard set on risk avoidance instead of remediation you can remove these applications with PowerShell.
 You&#x27;ll need to utilize the Remove-AppxPackage and Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage Cmdlet to &quot;uninstall&quot; the Appx. 
 Nessus showed vulnerabilities for these apps afterwards because the Windows app directory exist for the vulnerable Appx here: C:\Program Files\WindowsApps. You&#x27;ll need to remove the Directory related to the removed Appx. I&#x27;ve only had luck removing these directories by running as SYSTEM via MECM.
 Something to note, if you remove the WindowsApps Appx Directory before running the PowerShell commands above you will not be able to remove the Appx with PowerShell.

                              <span>How do you best secure both the jump host/ jump box and the admin’s credentials?
 These are what I can think of:
 Restrict inbound network access to the jump boxes to only RDP port access from your RDS servers and ports and IP addresses required for AD communication and configuration management.
 Configure AppLocker to restrict software running on the jump boxes.
 Require smart card authentication to login to the jumpboxes.
 Add licenses to the jump boxes so more than 2 admins can login at a time.

                              <span>Hi,
 Im new as sysadmin, and i have checked alot of resources to resolve this but no luck. Hope that you guys can guide me through this step.
 So basically, users cannot install apps without an admin permission. Risk has just raised a point that they are able to download and run portable applications. I have been assigned to block that.
 In our environment, we are using ManageEngine Central, i thought of uaing that to implement this policy, but there was no such option. The optiones offered by GPO is to block specific application installation by either name of hash, i need it to be general for all portable apps.
 I have imported a full list of all applications installed in our environment, thought of creating a whitelist and prohibiting any other application, but no luck in that as well as im not sure which solution to use to enforce this scenario.
 The department is willing to purchase a solution and implement it to control such aspects, as security has a magnificent intrest of the management. Please let me know if any solution provides this capability.
 Thank you

                              <span>Good morning!
 Recently some tickets have been showing up and being escalated to me about users who can&#x27;t open excel spreadsheets on a file share because they are locked by an unknown user. When I check Open Files on the file share I can see who has them open. Well, I asked the user if they could close out of the spreadsheet if they were done and they replied that they didn&#x27;t even have it open. Sure enough there was no lock file in the directory either. If I kill the open file, then another user can open it but this problem repeats itself randomly.
 I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s a share permission or drive permission that&#x27;s causing this but everything looks good... Is there a way to analyze permissions through directory trees (like see an overview of what the user has permissions to do starting from the root of the share) or is this something else entirely? I&#x27;ve googled like a madman and everything just says to remove lock files or close it from Open Files on the server itself.

 a few example include local admins, giving permissions via username and not via security group, misconfiguration, etc...

                              <span>Anyone know....
 Hope this makes sense. Renewed the RootCA cert on a 2 tier install last week.
 I renewed the offline Root CA. No issues here. Took files and copied them over to SubCA and the other server where IIS is running. Did the certutil DSpublish command on the crt file and crl file. Command ran ok and says added to the DS store.
 When I look in pkiview though I have an error on the root level for AIA Location #2. Says Unable to download. The path is correct but it has the old RootCa crt file name listed and not the new one. Everything on the SubCA in PKIView shows OK and the AIA has the new root (3) file listed etc just fine.
 AIA Location #2 Unable to Download http://pki.domain.com/crl/name1(2).crt.crt) and it should be name1(3).crt.
 Both the old RootCA cert (2) and the new (3) exist at that path and I can see them when browsing to that location in a browser and both files will download fine.
 If I go into Manage AD Containers , the new renewed root ca cert shows up under Certificate Authorities Container tab as well as the AIA Container tab correctly. I cannot figure out why everything appears ok, but the file name is not updated in the pki path to the new cert name and it says unable to download. Both the old file (2) and new one (3) have the same permissions.
 What would cause that, and how can I change it? I have done this twice in the past and not encountered this.

 thx

                              <span>Just wondered exactly what is meant in this context by Offline / Online?
 I&#x27;m guessing something to do with VSS snapshots?
 The reason for my question is that a customer is using WSB to backup a VM with an encrypted OS.
 The backup is showing as an Offline backup - I&#x27;m assuming that this machine will not be able to be restored in a running state thus undermining the disk encryption?
 Is an offline backup just a backup of the VHDX not in a running state?
 Thanks

                              <span>Anyone ever done a Unit4 ERP implementation? What’s your impression of the company? What was the process like?
 Currently I’m the IT person on the project team handling SSO and user provisioning and I can wholeheartedly say that they leave a really bad impression in every possible way so far. Their in-house consultants are absolutely clueless and the processes are archaic. I am just in shock after every meeting.
  
You want SSO? Create a ticket and someone in a completely different time zone will not read your request properly and it will take days to sort things out.
 What does the user status “Parked” and “Terminated” mean? No clue. One “consultant” went so far as to suggest to read F1 help - which of course did not help.
 What should be considered when choosing a user ID? Silence.
 Generally they can maybe answer about 10% of the questions, for the rest they need to ask someone else. Sometimes they even get back to you after that.
  
It’s a bit of a nightmare and other departments engaging with different consultants share that feeling. Curious what your experience is. Or does just every ERP implementation suck?

 Here looking for advice on what to do, with an emphasis on security obviously. Should i buy 5 say Dells and centrally manage them with something like InTune. 
 No central office as such and all work remotely, so any recommendation on software for providing remote support like ConnectWise or Bomgar but looking ideally for something not expensive at the moment.

                              <span>Currently in the limbo of having no guidance career-wise and everything being self-directed learning. Was working toward the AZ-104 when I sort of got side tracked with PowerShell and have been focusing on that almost exclusively, currently working through the book &#x27;PowerShell in Action&#x27;, but I have moments of wondering if it&#x27;s a bit overkill since it is a substantially deeper lever than anywhere near what is needed in my environment. 
 Still definitely have AZ-104 on my radar as well as eventually trying to learn Python, as I do not currently know any other languages. 
 My lack of networking knowledge/experience has made me consider pursuing a CCNA, but really I don&#x27;t know if I have an interest in being a networking engineer outside of some of the salaries that I see. 
 I know. It&#x27;s not all about money. But when you are in your early 30s with 2 kids and nothing meaningful saved up for retirement it does start to be about money. Looking for the biggest return on my time investment and am struggling to develop a concrete plan going forward for the next 5-10 years. 
 Please help.

                              <span>BGP novice here. Our growing company will soon be opening a secondary office/datacenter in a different geographic region. Our primary site/headquarters is currently single-homed and uses provider-assigned IP addresses, but will soon be multi-homed and our new site will be multi-homed from day one. Each site will be served by local ISPs that do not operate outside their respective regions. We will be getting full BGP tables from each ISP.
 Each site will have unique IPv6/IPv4 prefixes. There will be VPN tunnels between the two sites, but no direct/dedicated connectivity.
 Would there be any advantages to having a separate ASN for each site? Would there be any disadvantages other than additional RIR fees?
 I am aware of something that Cisco calls &quot;neighbor allow-as&quot;. Would we need to use something like that if the two sites share an ASN, or would the simple fact that they are announcing unique prefixes ensure that their use of a shared ASN doesn&#x27;t get treated as a BGP loop?
 If it matters, we hope to implement RPKI from the start and we wouldn&#x27;t want the secondary site to have a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) that would allow it to announce prefixes used by the headquarters or vice versa. (Such as could happen accidentally due to misconfiguration, or if the site were to suffer a security breach.) My cursory understanding is that we will be able to have distinct ROAs for each site with only the prefixes assigned to that site, but I it would be great if someone could confirm that for me.
 Thanks in advance for any insight!

                              <span>I am looking for the safest way to connect our PDs to a power source. They are POE compatible and the switch on site does provide this but a question has been raised that i cannot find an answer for. 
 - Will we lose power to the devices if there are any issues with the network (not loss of power to the actual switch)
 In addition to this, I was hoping you could help with the best option out of these 3, this would be in addition to requiring a network connection to the devices.
 - Use switch POE
 - Use POE Injector at device location
 - Use standard 24V Power supply for device

                              <span>I have a Fortigate in Azure that shows the following error &quot; virtual machine agent not ready&quot;
 The article below describes how the Fortigate VM may be trying to reach the Azure fabric at 168.63.129.16 incorrectly over an internal port instead of correctly over the external facing port.
 https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGate-Azure-showing-virtual-machine-agent-not/ta-p/214315
 That all makes sense - until the last part of the article. It suggests that if an internal or external load balancer is used ( it is in our case we use both ) then 2 static routes to the Azure fabric are needed - one to the internal port and one to the external.
 We have that in place and still we have an error.
 Thing is i can&#x27;t get my head around why a static route to 168.63.129.16 internal port is needed as well as a static route to 168.63.129.16 over the external port. It makes no sense.
 Any suggestions much appreciated.

                              <span>Having a really weird issue with our old Dell VRTX. For years its been running solid with no issues on 2 M630 blades. We recently purchased a new M640 blade and I&#x27;m working on getting it installed. I had it loaded into slot 3 and was able to get ESXI installed on it with no issues....HOWEVER, when the new blade comes up, blade/hose 2 goes down network wise...and they fight each other for pings. If one is working, the other isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s almost like they have the same ip address(which they don&#x27;t) nor do any of the 4 nics have the same mac address that I can see. 
 It&#x27;s a small network, flat with no vlans, so there&#x27;s no special config R1-2401 vrtx switch.
 Has anyone ever run into this before?

Our WISP uses OSPF for our IGB, but it&#x27;s starting to show it&#x27;s limitations due to the size of our network. It&#x27;s been proposed that we also run BGP, with the variable &quot;Next Hop&quot; set to &quot;Self&quot; Does anyone have any ideas as I&#x27;m struggling to see how this would help, what it would do, etc... Any help explaining this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
 P.S Using MikroTik gear.

                              <span>Due to lack of availability of high-speed (2.5Gb, 10Gbit) small switches with the right combination of features from our usual enterprise brands, it&#x27;s been suggested that we could consider an inversion of sorts, trunking through inexpensive but higher-speed unmanaged switches at the core and still use enterprise PoE+ switches at the edge.
 The idea currently is that all traffic going through the &quot;dumb core&quot; would be VLAN tagged; anything plugging into the core would be VLAN-aware. Besides the edge switches, the core would have at least one NAS and several Macs, for high-speed media sharing workflows.
 As an unusual architecture, I have zero doubt that /r/networking will love it immediately. Assuming that we&#x27;re not going to have any end-users able to plug anything into the core and looping it up, what&#x27;s the pro/con and has anyone run this in production?

                              <span>I recently discovered that there is an entire industry pushing on PoE lighting. Most of it is focused on commercial buildings. I love technology but I&#x27;m struggling to see the benefits. The only thing I&#x27;ve found that is remotely objective is that PoE is low voltage and therefore, does not require conduits to be run for lighting. After factoring the cost of switches and maintenance of switches, Im not sure this is still a benefit. Is there a real benefit to PoE lighting?

                              <span>Hey fellas, trying to make that next step in my career and would like some input from like minded people, I have been a NetEng with Varying levels of experience of up to 6 years in Networks, VoIP, wireless and some security, I can sense a major shift in how we perceive networks happening and I wanted to get in on it, I am however split between taking either a security or devnet path, on one hand, I might have to start over as a junior in security and on the other, I&#x27;ll have to start learning python and a whole lot more, anyone who took such a leap that can give their 2 cents? Which do you think is in more demand, or will be in more demand and futureproof?
 Thanks

                              <span>If you use SRP still due to Windows Pro editions, your security rules might not be enforced anymore on some machines. But AppLocker works on any current cumulative update for Win11 and Win10 Pro, even if managed by group policy - it no longer requires Enterprise.
 So this is actually a massive improvement over needing to use SRPs, but Microsoft never really announced SRPs would stop being enforced so it&#x27;s a security risk if you don&#x27;t know to roll out AppLocker.
 The article on AppLocker being enabled for all editions is referring to some older updates but a lot of people are reporting it didn&#x27;t start working until more recently. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5024351-removal-of-windows-edition-checks-for-applocker-e3a763c9-6a3e-4d9c-8623-0ffe69046470

I&#x27;ve been thinking of creating my own portfolio where I show my DHCP, DNS and any other labs I have conducted is there a resourceful tool where I can show this. A friend recommended git hub (he&#x27;s a software engineer) but that seems to be full of coding jargon and such. If anyone has any recommendations It would be highly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi. I have a home server and trying to figure out which way to set it up. This is not server hardware but just a home-built PC with 3x 4tb drives running either 2016 or 2019 essentials. I used to just create a RAID-5 via disk management with NTFS but was wondering if it is better to set up a ReFS pool similar to RAID-5
 My server primarily is used to back up Windows clients and some files.

 Connecting remotely just puts us into limited user mode. I&#x27;m trying to come up with a way to gain access without having to fly out and do it manually with a boot tool.
 I&#x27;m not sure I could even step half the users through noting off of USB, but that seems to be the only other option by making a boot USB, shipping it to them, and tailoring it to automatically run the tool to reset the admin password? Anything like that exist?

                              <span>Client of mine has a Dell VRTX that has 2 M630 blades and they&#x27;ve had a 640 blade just sitting around for a while and they&#x27;ve asked me if I could get it installed for them. I told them I&#x27;d take a look at it.
 I slotted in the new blade and saw it&#x27;s firmware was higher than the CMC firmware so the CMC needed to be updated. 
 Got the CMC updated to the latest firmware; however, the internal nics will not come up to allow the blade access to external network. 
 Nics are all enabled on the R1-2401 and I can see blades one and 2 have all of their nics active, but this new blade will not bring them up. I&#x27;ve even gone into the switch an shut/no shut the ports to see if that would bring them up and nadda.
 ​
 Any thoughts? I&#x27;m not very familiar with the old VRTX chassis

I&#x27;ve got adequate PowerShell and batch scripting experience to remove some barriers and increase efficiency and I&#x27;ve got the aptitude to learn a language, but I&#x27;m curious if any of you have picked up an actual programming language like Python or C++, and found that it has taken your sys admin capabilities to another level.
 I&#x27;m envisioning creating things like applets for the support team, or even a website for users that provides some kind of self-service portal (just brainstorming).
 Have any of you learned a programming language and found that it&#x27;s made you a better, more capable sys admin?

                              <span>I work for an MSP in technical sales, my job is to work with potential clients to explain why they need a sysadmin among other things and as a result I directly create openings for IT jobs. I&#x27;m on your side, I know how valuable what you do is. In this sub though I see so much hostility to even relatively non-intrusive sales outreach like emails and LinkedIn here. 
 I don&#x27;t understand why the default assumption is that any cold outreach is not possibly worth considering. I occasionally work with IT directors/managers but usually non-technical decision makers, and typically if I can provide a valid reason for why I wanted to reach out to them, they are happy to hear the 10 second version, provide a maybe or no, then potentially book a meeting.
 I&#x27;m biased, but it seems insane to me to assume anyone who emails you twice should be blocked - how do you know it&#x27;s not a good product or service? Your job depends on sales and marketing too, you wouldn&#x27;t be employed if sales and marketing teams at your company weren&#x27;t pitching plenty of good products and services, the level of vitriol doesn&#x27;t compute to me?

                              <span>TL:DR : Need to migrate more than 3000 DLs to new domain in O365 via PS, how would I do that?
 ​
 Hello Everyone,
 I&#x27;m working on migrating all the DLs of the organisation across all the locations.
 So we have DLs with the domain [admin@oranges.com](mailto:admin@oranges.com) and newly created DLs with [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com) domain.
 I am looking to convert all of them to [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com).
 My plan is :
  
export all the DLs via PS in CSV (How would I do that)
 Remove new DLs (as they are already in the new domain) and teams groups (someone told me it will also show private teams groups).
 Add @ apples.com domain to the DLs.
 Make @ apples.com domain as primary domain.
  
Is it how am I suppose to do or is there any better idea?
 To approximately 50 most used DLs, I migrated them manually, also renamed as it had old company name in the Display name.
 Now I can&#x27;t think of texting individual DL owners to see if they are still in use, so I am just thinking of migrating all of them.
 Please help how would go about this, any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hello I am the sole sysadmin for a mom and pop shop that had massive growth. (i’m a new hire)
 I fixed up the MS365 tenant, did cost optimisation with those licences, set up a proper 3-2-1 Dissaster recovery solution etc.
 Now I want to tackle the self signed certificates (eg. internal documentation webservers, prometheus, grafana, etc)
 my fist idea was to just use the openssl CLI tool, I also checked out the AD CS (seems janky with the web portal only working in IE)
 So my question for you guys is: what do you use to manage your PKI. I’d love to find a tool that make sit easy to manage the certs.
 Thankyou for your help!

 I&#x27;m starting a position with an IT team in a museum soon and I&#x27;m wondering if anybody here has any experience in this exact environment?
 I&#x27;m looking for any prerequisites it&#x27;s be worth me doing or if there&#x27;s anything about working in a museum that&#x27;ll be significantly different from your standard office environment. 
 It&#x27;s primarily working with MS365, Active Directory, ticket management.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>KB5025221 seems to interfere with brother&#x27;s DCP-L2540DW printer&#x27;s document scanner functionality.
 This was confirmed when the functionality was restored after uninstalling KB5025221.
 ​
 I&#x27;m pretty sure scanners and copiers are something that is still used in some office settings so this this information maybe valuable to someone.
 ​
 If you have a brother multi-function printer that includes a document scanner and you keep getting an error scanner is not connecting you can always try removing this update and see if it starts working again for you.

                              <span>Let me say, I am not network smart at all.
 Currently my company advocates for static IP at the printers. We had some printers get moved around and lost their connections. I was told is because the new ports are not on the same subnet. I have no idea what that means but it sounded cool. 
 The other thing that is going on, the network guys want to subnet for printers and other collections. This means we have to re-IP all printers.
 I suggested that we us hostnames/FQDN for printers and it was like I was talking about someone religion, or their parents, or the best motor oil. 
 It seems to me if we go with a standard host naming convention and connected to those printers via FQDN rather than IP, things would run a lot smoother and the network chasers can re-IP all they want. 
 what is/are the best business practices here, short of chaining the printers to the wall?

About 22&#x27; by 50&#x27; with a table of 22 places at the center (9 seats each sides and 2 at each extremity). I&#x27;m looking for a conference system (camera, audio, mic, etc) that can be used in this setup.
 I cannot find anything for long rooms... only large and like 8-10 people max and about 25 feet distance max.
 If you have any suggestion, let me know.
 I&#x27;m from Québec province in Canada.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Evening all,
 Wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue and how they approached it. We have a few users who are being constantly locked out by brute force attempts (about 50 attempts every hour). The users have MFA so we aren&#x27;t too concerned about them gaining access but finding it frustrating having to constantly unlock the accounts. We have conditional access policies in place but because the conditional access takes effect after first factor it doesn&#x27;t prevent the lockout. I have reached out to our Contact at Microsoft for some advice also but thought I would check in here as well for any other ideas
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m experimenting with Telnet in a home lab setting, I&#x27;d like to connect to another machine from my main laptop and I&#x27;m having the following issue: I get the message “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”.
 Here is a breakdown.
 ​
  
I want to connect with Laptop 1 to Laptop 2.
 Laptop 1: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.55.
 Laptop 2: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.62.
 Both are connected to the same wireless network.
 When attempting to use Telnet on Laptop 1 to connect to Laptop 2, I get the following message in CMD, with admin privileges, “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”. 
 Telnet client is activated on both machines.
 Firewall settings on Laptop 1 enable me to use Telnet. I tested this and was able to connect to another machine, a Linux laptop, on the same network, without any issue. I totally disabled the firewall on Laptop 2, and I’m still having issues when using Telnet.
 I can connect to Laptop 2 using RDP on Laptop 1.
 Rebooting did not solve the issue.
 
  
Has anyone run into this issue before or have any suggestions? Cheers!

                              <span>TL;DR: setup and monitor the RFC compliant email addresses like Abuse and Webmaster! 
 Long:
 I recently dealt with a website that was compromised. There was a credit card stealer script embedded on the webserver. The script was caught by our antivirus software on a user PC they they went to buy something on this website. My user raised a ticket and I investigated. I knew nothing about this vendor of ours besides the domain. I queried the domain registrar for the owner email address and got the private registration proxy one. Armed with this information I fired a quick email to the following addresses about the security incident:
  
Registrar proxy
 abuse@
 security@
 webmaster@
 hostmaster@
 support@ 
  
The IT team of the vendor resolved the issue and I got a thank you email from them.
 However, of all these, only the webmaster@ address worked, the rest bounced back. I have come across this more frequently as new generation of sysadmins xome onboard, they don&#x27;t know about this. So please, setup an alias or shared mailbox to monitor these accounts!

                              <span>Is hard. Are we the only team, and I suppose all of IT, that gets held to its standards? Seems like whenever someone we supports f’s something up, it’s “well he didn’t know that Mars was in Aquarius so he should have waited until Wednesday” but it you change the border color on your intranet page it’s BLAH BLAH BLAH need a meeting and BLAH BLAH”.
 We are held to policies to the letter but Sara from accounting “Well she has been here for 60 years so it’s ok”.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have a strange case with NTLM.
 I&#x27;ve configured my domain controllers, servers &amp; clients to use LAN Manager Authentication Level : Send NTLMv2 response only, Refuse LM &amp; NTLM.
 I&#x27;ve double checked everything, even in the registry LSA -&gt; Lmcompatibility is 5. 
 If I look into the domain controllers security event viewer, I still see pretty much events with NTLM v1 successful logons (event 4624). I think that this is because of certain computers which aren&#x27;t using the FQDN to connect to a share. 
 I&#x27;m just worried why it still shows me NTLM v1.... All the devices are W10, W11 &amp; W2016 and as I understood, it should enforce NTLM v2.
 Do I miss something ? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 I&#x27;ve installed MIM many times but this will be the first install with a multi server instance (active and standby)
 Ive installed SharePoint on one server. But i need to install Mim on another server. So when trying to install SharePoint. I am trying to connect to the database. But it says I selected a single server farm.
 So my question is. When selecting the role in SharePoint install on initial server. Which option should I select?
 None of the options seem close to what I want.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;ve been trying for a few days to setup a IKEv2 PSK (for simplicity) VPN server. This server should run as a virtual machine on a proxmox deployment. I&#x27;ve disabled proxmox&#x27;s firewall for this specific machine 
 The host is behind a Mikrotik CRS326 router, on which i have configured port forwarding for ports 500 and 4500 UDP to the VPN server (at 192.168.1.7) in the dstnat chain, the firewall rules to allow traffic on those ports via the UDP ports are also in place. 
 The current /etc/ipsec.conf config is this one: 
 config setup
 charondebug&#x3D;&quot;ike 1, knl 1, cfg 0&quot;
 uniqueids&#x3D;no
 ​
 conn ikev2-vpn
 auto&#x3D;add
 compress&#x3D;no
 type&#x3D;tunnel
 keyexchange&#x3D;ikev2
 fragmentation&#x3D;yes
 forceencaps&#x3D;yes
 ike&#x3D;aes256-sha1-modp1024,3des-sha1-modp1024!
 esp&#x3D;aes256-sha1,3des-sha1!
 dpdaction&#x3D;clear
 dpddelay&#x3D;300s
 rekey&#x3D;no
 left&#x3D;%any
 leftid&#x3D;192.168.1.7
 leftcert&#x3D;/etc/ipsec.d/certs/vpn-server-cert.pem
 leftsendcert&#x3D;always
 leftsubnet&#x3D;0.0.0.0/0
 right&#x3D;%any
 rightid&#x3D;%any
 rightauth&#x3D;eap-mschapv2
 rightdns&#x3D;192.168.1.1
 rightsourceip&#x3D;10.20.30.0/24
 rightsendcert&#x3D;never
 eap_identity&#x3D;%identity
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When i try to connect i see exactly one packet on port 500 on mikrotik&#x27;s counter for firewall rules, well, NAT rules in this case and that&#x27;s it, nothing more, the phone i&#x27;m testing this with gives up and states &quot;disconnected&quot;, the whole process take 1-2 seconds. 
 I really have 0 idea what i did wrong.

I&#x27;ve just learned that MAC are always randomised when using Direct, so that&#x27;s a dead end. Would anyone know if there is anyway to trace it? I&#x27;m looking at other ways of identifying the source but want to check in case there is anything to look out for from this.

 Need remote access capabilities for outsourced individuals from South Africa and others to remotely access a US-based private company with such an item as a HyperV Host Server running a GPU on-premise - not necessarily that of Azure/Amazon. 
 Need capacity for 5-8 users to remotely access applications such as AutoCAD Mechanical/Electrical/LT, Adobe Pro, and Office 365. Growth could move to 10-15 users. 
 Drawings will come from the local file server. The present jobs server is 2TB+.

                              <span>Hey all
 I am working on an assignment which basically has the question of identifying an exploit with a relevant CVE that would allow for TCP session identification. The closest I could find to this was CVE-1999-0667 with ARP spoofing, where the cache is poisoned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
 I am however confused, as I do not know if this constitutes as an exploit or just a technique within an exploit. I tried my hardest to skim through thousands of CVEs to see if there were any exploits related to the identification of TCP sessions, but most of them were just denial-of-service attacks.
 I would appreciate some clarification on this topic because I am just so lost

                              <span>I have a 7606-S with RSP720 that had an ESM card (7600-ES20-GE3C). In the process of replacing it with a 7600 ES+ card (76-ES+XC-20G3C) I had both in the chassis and pretty much copy pasted the config for each interface in use and unplugged the cables and SFPs from the old card and plugged them into the new one.
 Apr 15 10:24:24 EST: %TRANSCEIVER-3-OPER_ENABLE_FAILURE: Detected for transceiver module in GigabitEthernet4/10, module disabled 
 Some SFPs were disabled. A few SFPs, I only noticed after I took another look at them are actually DS-SFP-GE-T, not SFP-GE-T.
 I added service unsupported-transceiver and no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid, but it made no difference.
 Is there no workaround for this? In the first place, what is DS-SFP-GE-T?? It doesn&#x27;t show up in the Cisco transceiver compatibility tool, DS makes me think mds9000 maybe? But it worked without complaint in the older linecard while it won&#x27;t work even with unsupported-transceiver in the ES+ one. 
 Right now I have both still installed until I probably end up getting the right SFPs, wondering if this was to be expected, on switches the hidden commands pretty much let you use any standard SFP with a scary warning prompt but on this platform it didn&#x27;t even show me the warning, though it didn&#x27;t have any effect either.

                              <span>It needs to be IOS XR.
 It needs to be 1RU.
 It needs to have at least 1 10G port, ideally 2. Expansion modules are fine too.
 Refurbished and even EoL is fine.

                              <span>I recently had an issue on one of my brand new fibre 9500 stacks where I was losing packets on multiple interfaces but predominately 1 link agg. I knew that one of the redundant power cables had come loose but as this was a major switch 2k users were passing through, not to mention public facing infrastructure, I put that aside while I tried every single thing I could think of to fix the 40% packet loss on a major interface (we were also getting minor packet loss on other interfaces but I didn’t find out till late in the troubleshooting process) when I finally had given up I was about to get Cisco TAC and out vendor support involved. As I was waiting on the phone for support I plugged in the redundant power into a less loose pdu and BAM!!! no packet loss across the board. Is this an rma issue or have I missed something?

                              <span>I am working on some homework question which asks how one would conduct a scan of a target network through IP obfuscation whilst seeing enough information about a port.
 I get that a SYN/ACK would be used in this case over a proxy server, but is that it? I am unsure if I am missing an extra step here, but from what I understand, the target host replying with its on SYN/ACK confirms it is alive. After this, I do not know if the scanner host would send a RST or an ACK to the target network.

 I know this is zero information to go on, but is it possible that there is an issue where the ISPs connect to the building (we’re in a large office building)? I’m not sure what else would cause a similar packet loss at similar times from 2 different ISPs

And you guessed it, no password logs anywhere. I see that there is a process with a serial cable to reset the admin password but it also notes that it erases the data on the system. I have been asked to retrieve some of the data on this unit so I don’t think I should do that. Does anyone know of any other options? 
 Also, I cant seem to find any technical documentation on this unit. With the WD and DDN acquisitions I have no idea where to get any documentation….. or what support number I can call. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
 Thanks!
