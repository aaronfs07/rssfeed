                              <span>Hi Guys,
 My business currently has me as the IT manager, small team of 3 and a development manager, team of 7. 
 The development manager is leaving and I’ve been offered to take over the managing of both teams. Now I know nothing about development really, at most I use powershell and cli etc. 
 They’re going to bring in a product manager below me to assist in deciding what new features to target and speccing it out, so most of my day to day would be people management and escalation in terms of the dev team. The IT team is going to get an apprentice at the bottom end to help move people up to fill any gaps when I’m not doing my day to day. 
 So two question’s really 
 1- has anyone managed a development team with minimal knowledge, and do you have any info or tips? 2- what would this role be called? Seems like a chance to bump out my CV a bit so want to make the most of it. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I primarily do web development, but recently a long time friend asked me help digitise their legacy workflows as they deal with a lot of paper. 
 I&#x27;ve got them setup with Google Workspace and will be helping on board them with a CRM for client management, as they do work for their same pool of clients a minimum of once a year. But I will also be installing and managing four new Windows 10 office PCs (HP Elitedesks)
 Can anyone please advise any best practices to help secure and manage these computers. I&#x27;m not local to them, so will be able to do onsite visits every couple of months, but it won&#x27;t be like popping around the corner to help them out. So anything I can do to help manage them securely remotely would be appriated.
 I&#x27;ve moved them away from Office and Outlook to web based GSuite. The CRM will integrate with GSuite through the browser. File management will be primarily scanned documents and saved PDFs going onto Google Drive and the CRM. 
 Browsers will be Chrome, probably managed through Google Workspace, uBlock origin installed. 
 Password management either via Google password manager or Bitwarden. 
 Remote support is currently provided by Teamviewer, but I don&#x27;t&#x27; think they&#x27;re on a paid plan, so I&#x27;m sure that will get cut off soon, and so I&#x27;ll give Chrome Remote Desktop a go unless an alternative good value solution can be suggested?
 Not sure if I should be doing any special configs with Windows?
 Is it worth having a dedicated AV in an office environment in addition to Defender? If so, what are people using?
 Any advise or links to best practices guides would be appreciated on how to approach a small business deployment like this. Thank you

                              <span>hey
 ​
 we will receive a Canon Selphy CP1500 soon - in most usecases the printer will be used in wi-fi direct prints, but it may be necessary to connec tit to the local wifi.
 I want to put it in printer vLAN, but i can&#x27;t find documentation on what ports are needed
 i found documention for canon business printers, but i guess i won&#x27;t need all of these ports and i only want to allow the necessary minimum
 ​
 has someone experience with canon selphy printers in this regard or with canon printers in general to guess what the bare minmum ports for printing would be?
 thank you for your advice!

 I would seriously recommended that the mods of this sub pin the letter as this has a serious impact on the future of reddit. I know many could care less about third party clients but having third party clients gives a better user experience and takes away some control from the reddit overlords. I want to choose what software I use to access reddit and with this api change we are all going to be limited on our choices

 You guys might have heard of IT under Finance department, but have you guys ever heard of IT under HR?
 Our IT department is under the supervision of the director of HR and IT, who we will call Lisa. Lisa started off at the company as an HR consultant. Eventually the company fired the previous director of IT, and hired her as the full time director of HR and IT. Under Lisa is an IT manager that manages the IT department.
 Lisa has no knowledge of IT, but still attends our daily meetings. Ever since HR took over, we had more frequent meetings, calling meetings for pretty much every single little thing. Even something small like setting up a naming convention for desktop and laptops, they had a least 2 meetings already, with no final naming sch…</span>

 What a generation.. the last one to know what it was like before everyone had the internet..to dial-up AOL... to today. We can write letters, checks, and cursive.. We had ICQ, IRC (still use today), Napster.... what a ride..

 • Ability to perform troubleshooting and analysis of PC hardware, PC operating systems (Win95, WinNT, Win2000, WinXP, Windows 2007) and office automation software, with expert level knowledge in at least one area of specialization.
 • Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE)
 I wonder what year this company works in. For those who aren&#x27;t aware besides the obvious Win95, you can&#x27;t even get MCSE anymore from Microsoft.

 I have a rather supportive executive staff, who is willing to accept changes to the environment that we need, and allows me to have near full control of the department.
 I’m still rather new to IT (less than 2 years full experience).
 Any tips/advice appreciated!

I&#x27;m talking about a blow-up I had with a &quot;client&quot; a couple of weeks ago and, because I know I have been on a short fuse and where they are coming from, I&#x27;m feeling a bit guilty and ranty.
 But, essentially, I don&#x27;t treat or think of the IT department in the same business model as the GeekSquad or any other tech service provider. I try my hardest to avoid calling anyone in the organization a &quot;client&quot; because I don&#x27;t want to encourage this service provider/recipient dynamic. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, my function in the org. is to keep the information technology systems and processes working, NOT provide value to you in the form of &quot;customer service&quot;. In most situations, &quot;good customer service&quot; and the necessary protocols and SOPs go hand in hand. When they don&#x27;t, STOP going up the chain of command or berating my &quot;dedication to quality service&quot; because you didn&#x27;t get what you want, how you want. I am your fucking co-worker doing my part to keep this shit floating, not someone you hired to do as you want.

She was persistent we did it and opens her laptop to show us the deleted mails. We noticed she had put a document that was stapled in the corner. This document staple pressed the delete button when she closed the laptop with the document inside causing outlook to delete the mails.

 Also...
 Has anyone else noticed this trend of utilizing legit websites&#x27; redirect URL format to get you to their phishing pages? This particular link is using two nested redirect URLs -_-

 I can’t say i didn’t see this coming, but what I will say is how is it that end users still think they can get away with this?
 A for effort I suppose
 It provided a good laugh today, which was needed between all the other stuff going on.
 What’s some stuff your end users have tried to install?

                              <span>If you have installed Windows 10 using a USB drive with an autounattend.xml file on it, this may pique your interest.
 TLDR: If the EFI partition on the system is too small, Windows 10 devices can not update to Windows 11 through a standard feature update. If you have ever used an autounattend.xml to install Windows from a USB, it&#x27;s likely the EFI partition is too small.
 We all know the (somewhat crazy) requirements to run Windows 11. One lesser know requirement (possibly new) not documented (yet) by Microsoft is the size of the EFI system partition. For those curious, the EFI system partition is what computers use to boot and talk with UEFI BIOS. Pretty important to have. This could be a new requirement as I have updated several devices to Windows 11 before, but now, those same models ca…</span>

One for admin work one for answering email. They were logged in using their non-admin logins, but then having to log in/out to their admin accts to do 95% of their jobs. It was a mess; completely unproductive environment. They had extreme difficulty doing, or even understanding, the most basic of tasks. 
 Since they have to login and out so many times, they do not log out of servers - they lock their sessions. This makes them vulnerable to a Mimikatz attack. 
 Help me see the light. With UAC and SentinelOne/ CrowdStrike,etc. is there any benefit whatsoever to running two logins these days?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m wondering how much ram does your company computer have? I&#x27;m talking here about the general computer, not the specific one that have special requirement.
 I&#x27;m currently on Windows 10 with 16gb ram for the majority of my task force. The CAD users have 32gb.
 I recently made an in-place upgrade to W11 and saw that it use quite more ram. Idle, I sit around 6 to 8gb of ram consumed. This made me think I might have to upgrade everyone to 32gb (or 24? I feel this is an odd number).
 ​
 Thank you!

So, we need to prevent Teams (and other Office desktop apps) from trying to use SSO based on their Windows login.
 Is there a group policy to either either prepopulate the desired alternate domain credentials or else just force the user to manually enter the credentials they need?

                              <span>I applied a GPO (Interactivity Logon - Machine Inactivity Limit) to an OU to auto-lock computer after 15 minutes. I needed to remove it and apply it to some nested OUs because it was locking a kiosk account that was under the initial OU.
 So I unlinked the GPO from the OU and linked it to the nested OUs. All the nested OUs got it after a GPForce. But after unlinking from the initial OU, it is still applying to the kiosk OU. 
 There isn&#x27;t a Disabled for this particular setting, so I don&#x27;t know how to apply an OU that will overwrite the lockout. 
 Anyone know how to clear out a policy that has been removed if there isn&#x27;t a way to apply a &quot;Disabled&quot; policy. Or would setting it to lock at 0 seconds mean it never auto-locks?

I&#x27;m trying to establish an SSH connection from one Kali machine to the other. I have properly configured all the necessary settings, but I&#x27;m encountering an issue with the incorrect fingerprint during the initial connection.
 I have ensured that the permissions on the ~/.ssh directory are set correctly, the SSH service is running, and I have copied the public keys appropriately. In the sshd_config file, I have configured &quot;PubkeyAuthentication&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;. However, when I run the command &quot;ssh -i /etc/kali/.ssh/id kali@ip&quot;, I receive the following error: &quot;The fingerprint is incorrect.&quot; I regenerated a pair of key but i steel have a diffrent fingerprint and it is always the same finger print it does not change

                              <span>There&#x27;s an ongoing debate around our office about the need to skill up on containerised workloads. As a mid-market MSP the only thing we run on-prem in a container is a DNS filtering service. Across our entire stack and customer base I cannot find another application for containers. Yet obviously there&#x27;s lots of talk about this being the future for a lot of applications.
 So my question is anyone running containerised workloads (Docker, Kubernetes, and the sort) on their on-prem infrastructure? If so what kind of things are you using containers to accomplish? Did you write applications in-house that you now host or did a vendor/ISV provide them this way?

                              <span>I&#x27;m inheriting an absurdly unmanaged environment of devices, somewhere around the 100 devices number and there is a large diversity from a couple of Win 3.1 and 2000 devices all the way up to w10. But most of the fleet is a mixture of w7 and w10 (enterprise). As well as the obligatory smattering of Linux devices here and there (mostly RHEL based). 
 The environment is also an &#x27;offline&#x27; environment, generally with no direct or proxy Internet access (though I could configure a proxy if absolutely needed to) I&#x27;m looking to start tidying up the fleet of...shit. and I&#x27;ve never actually been the one to stand up config tools like SCCM/configmgr, Ansible, Puppet etc. 
 I don&#x27;t really like the idea of SCCM due to cost the relatively small environment. So am considering tools like Ansible, Chef and Powershell DSC. 
 I like the idea of PowershellDSC as most client endpoints already have the powershell required as well as the native powershell management. And the environment is primarily Windows.
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be used my most people over other config tools.
 Ansible on the other hand seems to be almost the defacto option and is better supported in the community. 
 I&#x27;m generally hoping for any feedback or opinions of the two options if anybody has experience of both?
 Another option could be Ansible for POSIX/*nix and DSC for Windows. But this seems like overkill

                              <span>Hi,
 I work in an organisation of around 7000 people with around 200 people in the IT department. I&#x27;m tasked with improving/sign-off on our naming standards, so far we have (see picture):
 low level account: john.smith@contoso.com
 Active directory privileged accounts using RBAC:
 T0a-smit001 (domain controller and tier 0 assetts)
 T1a-smit001 (Tier 1 assets such as application servers)
 T2a-smit001 (Tier2 assets such as laptops) 
 O365 admins: [jsmith@contoso.com](mailto:jsmith@contoso.com) (non synced account)
 Azure AD infrastructure, 2nd tenancy: [john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) (non synced account)
 We have more cloud environments coming along... 
 The question I have is what&#x27;s the best way to manage the naming standard?
 Ideally I want something that&#x27;s easy to see purpose at a glance, without screaming administrator.
 I&#x27;m also getting pushback from people saying they have too many accounts\passwords to remember.
 Also, do you differentiate the account name for things such as contractors and 3rd parties?
 Advice appreciated.

 By chance I came across the solution on another subreddit. 
 https://forum.gitlab.com/t/after-upgrade-from-15-11-5-to-16-0-gitlab-ce-down-cpu-100/86924/33
 Thought I&#x27;d give this a little bit more attention since it&#x27;s not in their release notes and it literally brings any server to its knees. It&#x27;s been a stressful 24hrs lol

                              <span>Hey all, 
 We are at the beginning stages of an AD and 365 tenant consolidation between 3 different companies. I am looking for a (semi?) automated way of gathering information that we could use. 
 Each site has a similar setup, on-premises AD, Azure AD connect, Office 365
 For example: 
  
Active Directory information (DC names, roles, domain, forest levels)
 User, group and service account list
 Azure AD connect information
 SharePoint site export
 Total SharePoint and OneDrive sizes
 Exchange online export
  
Anyone know of a great script or tool that would bring this information in? If not I can break down some instructions for my fellow sysadmins to run multiple scripts. 
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I am looking for some advice on how to progress with an issue I am seeing for the company I work for (UK based with a .com address).
 It looks like the company that hosts our DNS records has gone bust. Our site and DNS records are available, but all the services for getting into our domain are unavailable (although the host site is still up) along with their telephone number and any ability to log tickets. We have tried looking online for options andcan see a number of comments on sites saying they appear to have ceased trading. Looking at Companies House (register of UK companies) they are overdue and it looks like they may actually have gone under.
 My question is what do we do now? The records are still avaialable and working but we need to get them migrated to a service that we can trust and make changes to. We can&#x27;t get through to the host to open a request to do this though. I was thinking of reaching out to ICANN as this is a .com domain but I am unsure if there are any other options available to us here.
 Has anyone gone through this before that can give help/assistance on this?

                              <span>I started working at a manufacturing facility about 5 months ago as a system administrator (or, that&#x27;s what the position practically is). They basically brought me in to get their systems upgraded, propose projects for development of their infrastructure, and conduct maintenance along with upgrades of software (along with helpdesk).
 There is a database (SQL Server) that is used for collecting sales information for customers. One of the upgrades I am going to be doing is upgrading the version of SQL Server being used along with the Windows Server version being used due to EOL of the server versions.
 Originally, I was going to be conducting the regular maintenance plan of getting software upgraded to latest versions along with some hardware upgrades.
 However, after analyzing the data in the database, I noticed issues that exist within the data itself, including redundancies, inconsistent data, and other issues with improperly built databases. My understanding is this is a database they&#x27;ve been using for years. Based on my experience so far, there have been issues they&#x27;ve had to deal with for a bit because of how the system is set up.
 Something I&#x27;ve been doing is looking at how their database is set up and recreating it using the database normalization techniques to reduce the issues we&#x27;ve been having (on a separate server of course). Along with this, I developed a web based application as a way to interact with this database. 
 I presented my ideas to my supervisor regarding my work and showed what it&#x27;s capable of. He seemed really interested in it and is going to be meeting with me to discuss it further.
 I&#x27;ve heard the horror stories of lower employees having their work stolen or credit taken by their supervisors. Should I be concerned about this? Part of me wants to go beyond expectations in this role, but I&#x27;ve been told to not do so by others. Should I stick with doing regular upgrades in my role?

                              <span>Good Morning everyone!
 We’re looking for implementing an Asset Management solution soon. We’re a medium size software company and all our devices are managed by an MDM so until now we haven’t felt the need for a dedicated asset management solution. However, with the growing number of assets and additional controls expected from the accounting team, we’re now looking for a good cloud solution.
 With so many options and due to the fact that providers adopt different pricing models (some charge by asset, some per user, others per site) and also don’t publish pricing on their websites, I was wondering if you guys could help me with some basic info about the solution you are using:
 - Provider:
 - Your organization size:
 - Price:
 I really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance and have a great weekend.

 Not sure this is the best place to post this, but Chase / Zelle are having major issues. Many people are seeing scheduled Zelle payments duplicated and wiping out their accounts. Chase customer support is on hold for “extenuating circumstances”. 
 This is a huge issue and want to spread the word where I can. SysAdmins gotta know what’s happening in the tech world. Good luck everyone

 How they can sale the key for 2.65$ while the same key from Microsoft cost more than 1000$ ? It can get activated and had worked more than a year, unfortunately had to format the windows and requires new key again! 
 How trustworthy this keys are ? After all it&#x27;s just a key not a cracking software!

 we have a fair number of people departing in a few months (education environment) and so we&#x27;ll be disabling their AAD/Microsoft 365 accounts soon. I&#x27;ve been asked if it&#x27;s possible to export all data (Onedrive for business/Outlook/Teams messages/Sharepoint Online sites etc.) for some of these users, in case they want to access it in the future.
 As I&#x27;ve stated, since this is an education environment, none of these users had access to any data that would be considered confidential, secure, or anything like that. From what it looks like, there&#x27;s no way to export this data, neither from their end, nor from the admin center. I did find something about using eDiscovery to do it, but we don&#x27;t want to use additional licenses or software to do any of this, especially since this won&#x27;t affect our operations at all. If need be, I&#x27;ll just tell the users to export their messages and download all their files manually, but seeing as many of them have upwards of 50 or even 100 Sharepoint sites (mainly due to MS Teams, but also manually created groups), I can&#x27;t imagine this will be wildly popular.
 Ideally, we&#x27;d like to know of a way for the users to be able to export their data by themselves, but I imagine that probably doesn&#x27;t exist, so is there a way to do it from my end without requiring a ton of manual work?
 Thanks in advance for any help.

It&#x27;s a similar role on paper but the environment, architecture, procedures and policies are very different. I&#x27;m having to refamiliarise myself with some basic skills and knowledge that I was educated on during uni but never had to apply in my previous role and also learning 100% new stuff which I feel like I probably should have already known? I feel like I&#x27;m pretty slow with the tasks I have been assigned and I&#x27;m feeling pretty dumb and useless. 
 My previous job was fresh out of uni so I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to start as a &#x27;skilled professional&#x27; at a new company. Is it normal to feel like a fish out of water when you start with a new company doing a similar role or am I just an imposter that got lucky?

                              <span>Hello, I have a little problem with my centreon and I can&#x27;t find an answer anywhere.
 I need to monitor the veeam services on a vm windows server via my centreon poller on centos but there&#x27;s a problem, the centreon commands return this error: &quot;Status information UNKNOWN: SNMP Table Request: resourceUnavailable (This is likely an out-of-memory failure within the agent)&quot;.
 Here&#x27;s my command /usr/lib/centreon/plugins//centreon_windows_snmp.pl --plugin&#x3D;os::windows::snmp::plugin --mode&#x3D;service --hostname&#x3D;xxx --snmp-version&#x3D;&#x27;2c&#x27; --snmp-community&#x3D;xxx --service&#x3D;&#x27;Veeam Cloud Connect Service&#x27; --warning&#x3D; --critical&#x3D;1: --state&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; --regexp
 I have already succeeded on other vm quite similar to monitor services so I think it is a problem with veeam. Does anyone have an idea please? Here to answer any question. Thanks a lot.

Now i wanna get a domain for a personal project and am not up to date as to which registrars are recommended or which to be avoided these days. Do we have a guide, post, Wiki entry or similar on this?

 Please let me know what you think and whether or not you experience any bugs or issues. Thinking this could be a good way of using AI but still learning things more properly instead of just asking GPT to answer.
 It does not work like GPT but more as an AI docs searcher and thus have very limited creativity ability. Feel free to shoot over questions if you are curious about how I built it or similar things

 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 I have a windows computer that perfectly receives it&#x27;s address from a windows DHCP server in our network. 
 When booting into a Linux OS with a live bootcd (USB) like Ubuntu, Debian, EndeavourOS, ... it all works perfectly and i receive the same IP from our DHCP server. 
 However, on the same computer i tried installing Arch Linux and i booted off the install medium like a normal Live CD but i never get any ip address.
 Arch sees the network card and indicates the interface is up but there is never a response from our DHCP server itself for this OS.
 MAC address is correctly detected and is correct in the DHCP server as well, that never changed.
 The following link shows you the DHCP request for Arch linux and EndeavourOS (Based on Arch).
 https://imgur.com/c3CxVtV
 Does anyone know why this happens and what i can do about it to solve this ?
 ​
 Many thanks !

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m working on deploying Hybrid Join for our windows computers in order to reduce the amount of separate logins users have to do for teams, onedrive, M365 services in browser etc. So far this seems promising.
 I&#x27;m searching for a way to find information about the tokens available within a session.
 For now, all I have is the &quot;SSO State&quot; information listed with dsregcmd /status. One thing I noticed is that the AzureAdPrtExpiryTime changes when you modify the Prt e.g. by adding and MFA claim.
 Could I get detailed information about which claims and accesses a user has at a given moment, either on the client or in the AAD console? This way I could performe detailed troubleshooting in the event of an unexpected login request.

 Been trying to find if this is even possible. We have a problem with end users directly contacting our helpdesk on Teams. Our helpdesk personel is getting somewhat annoyed by pointing users to the correct way of creating a ticket.
 This will of course not solve the issue, but some users do not know... and some do not really care. So it would at least help and inform the users.
 Is it possible for an administrator to submit a custom status message for a group of people in Teams? We would like to have the ability from the administrators perpective to change this message for all helpdesk users at once.

 I&#x27;ve allowed all DLL&#x27;s signed by a trusted publisher, but this exception\Rule does not seem to apply to the .pyd files. And when creating rules for dll&#x27;s im unable to select .pyd files.
 Any guidance would be highly appreciated since my googlings haven&#x27;t resulted in much.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We recently got 30 users joining our organization and we want to enroll them in Intune / Autopilot. Our first step is upgrading their W11 home edition to pro so that we can apply the Windows 10/11 Enterprise E5 license and enroll them.
 ​
 We have contacted our Microsoft partner we currently get our licenses from and they quote 180 euro for a W11 pro license, retail pricing is 150 euro and the grey market (CD-keys, G2A, etc) is 15 euro. I have read that Microsoft volume licensing is an option but we don&#x27;t have access to that.
 The grey market option is attractive however I am worried that the keys might get deactivated in the future.
 Which option would be the best to upgrade 30 users from W11 home to pro?

                              <span>Hello all,
 we have a pretty weird problem with Exchange/Outlook. 
 Scenario: We are an international company (let&#x27;s call it contoso) with about 1800 employees spread over several countries in Europe. We have 1 domain and no domain trusts. Now we (contoso) have bought a company in Spain and this company should be integrated into our system. 
 Our infrastructure:
 - 2 physical Exchange Servers 2019 - which are up to date.
 - 2 virtual Exchange Server 2019 - which are also up to date
 - A Sophos SG Firewall - with a WAF configured for our exchange servers after best practice
 - Multible Domain Controllers
 - Office 2016
 Let me know if you need to know more about our infrastructure.
 What happened so far:
 - we bought the domain contoso-spain.com
 - we have created the domain autodiscover.co…</span>

                              <span>A thought struck me the other day as I was doing some housekeeping in our AD: How do people go about cleaning up and/or keeping their AD&#x27;s under control over the years?
 The backdrop for this question is that our AD is, when you go way back, originally from 2001. As such it&#x27;s seen its fair share of server-versions all the way up from WinSrv2000, and I&#x27;m still finding remnants of such ever now and then in the form of old built-in accounts, various groups and even the odd dead server or two that hasn&#x27;t been properly removed from the domain.
 How do people deal with this? Basically set up a new domain within the same forest and move what you want/need over, or do you spin up an entirely new forest with a new domain and then migrate things?

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin :)
 I work for a small start up that is using a Synology for file storage. 5 users connecting from all over the world and having access to different folders on the NAS. Everything works fine and everyone is happy, but me. There are around 5TB of data on that Synology. I need an affordable &quot;Synology in the cloud&quot;. Where I can set users and access levels and have the data securely stored in the cloud. I also prefer a cloud in Europe - even better Germany - (privacy concerns) . What is the best practice for larger companies? I am very low on budget. I want to offer a solution that I feel safer with. (If the NAS fails - no one has access to data for several days)
 Thanks a lot guys

                              <span>This past March our company entered a contract with a provider that provides us with Microsoft E3 licenses. Along with this came some professional services that helped us finish an initial Intune rollout. 
 On call 4of6 with our rep, I casually asked about the impact of a domain loss and name change on our tenant. I fully expected this to be a softball (I was hired on as a level one guy), and that my VP or anyone in our C suite would have posed this question at the beginning of our contract. 
 My rep paused for a moment, knowing our situation with Intune, our current DC, etc. He basically said we might as well not even finish this call, and mentioned how little time we have. My heart sunk.
 Since starting at my company I have been trying to get us onto a more modern platform, one that is easier overall for our users.
 With all that being said, doing double MS e3 licenses for 7 months is a non starter for our leadership. 
 Problem: we have ~650 PCs on old DC, most of which are remote and our VPN solution is a) sophos ssl b) not widely used
 My proposed plan: New DC: All new/current gen pcs are enrolled We redistribute devices on new domain Users continue to use old e3 resources on devices (office licenses) until we are ready to roll out name change and new tenant
 We have to be out of using our old name and tenant Jan 1
 My question: is there any easier way than this?
 Just about anything is on the table as long as I can tangibly point to a labor savings, and make it as easy on our users as possible. We can probably even talk about switching back to o365 and use those savings for some other solution.
 Thanks for taking the time to help a bit with this

 I&#x27;m having an issue where a VM has nothing indexed and when rebuilding the index to include needed folders it finds 111 items and says indexing complete.
 Has someone encountered something similar and maybe you have a fix?

Is it secure enough or I should use the software like OpenVPN or make my own private AP using smartphone?

                              <span>Hi All, Im in the middle of a network refresh in our secondary data center and we are implementing Vxlan evpn fabric with Cisco n9ks. I am learning all I can in this short time before we deploy, but I can’t seem to find a good resource that explains how Broadcast unknown unicast and multicast traffic works in the overlay. Do I need to have multicast in the underlay (Pim sparse mode) in addition to mp-bgp evpn? It would seem that with evpn and arp suppression it wouldn’t be necessary. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve been trying to implement option 156 in KEA DHCP as outlined in this forum : 
 https://www.shoretelforums.com/forum/shoretel-tech/administrators/650-how-to-configure-option-156-in-linux-dhcpd
 The option has been defined as a string , and I set CSV to true, as I want multiple values to be sent to the clients.
 Unfortunately KEA doesn’t accept “array of strings” as a valid option and will not start.
 After removing the array line, predictably , only the first value is sent to the client and it appears to be a decimal string not a string the same way it was configured.
 Based off this guidance 
 https://ftp.ripe.net/mirrors/sites/ftp.isc.org/isc/kea/1.5.0/doc/kea-guide.html#dhcp4-custom-options
 I am hoping to specify the option as a “record” and specify multiple data types and pray it accepts it.
 Unfortunately I feel this won’t work because “When array is set to true and type is set to &quot;record&quot;, the last field is an array, i.e., it can contain more than one value ” will probably just complain about an array of strings again.

                              <span>Hello, I have setup route reflector and RR clients via GoBGP using l2vpn-evpn. I also have VTEP setup on the RR client server, for example - KVM - Bridge - Vxlan. This might be a stupid question, but could GoBGP automatically advertise the route if I attach a new KVM device to the bridge? Or do I have to manually advertise the routes via GoBGP cli? If it&#x27;s automatic, I would really appreciate a working example. I picked up GOBGP because it seemed really easy to use, but would FRR offer me more debugging functionality?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Sorry if this has been asked a million times.
 I&#x27;m quite new to BGP, I know that iBGP doesn&#x27;t change attributes mainly the next hop. How do Large ISPs generally configure their BGP networks?
 Would they have hundreds of routers within an iBGP AS, using route reflectors, changing editing the next-hop IP and injecting null routes to bring the BGP prefixes into the routing tables
 Or do they have hundreds of small iBGP AS&#x27;s with 5-6 routers inside all linked together using eBGP?
 The first way was how I did my EVE lab, but was getting tricky/lot of work to implement (around 15 routers).
 Or do they have another method that I haven&#x27;t thought of?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey yall!
 I am a little confused and am just looking for some thoughts or feedback on an issue. I have a client that uses an iPhone 6 to stream Pandora in their workshop. The issue is, I can see the device is connected to the Unifi AP (U6-Pro) but the traffic going to and from the iPhone is... Pausing? Pandora loses connection and requires someone to turn the screen on and then it starts playing again.
 I have been pinging the device for a while and I can see there is traffic for a few seconds, like it&#x27;s checking in, then nothing for another few minutes. Now if someone actually goes and plays Pandora again it will ping for several minutes then the ping stops followed by the music, still connected to WiFi.
 My thought is that there is some kind of &quot;WiFi Pausing&quot; feature that doesn&#x27;t disconnect the WiFi but pauses the connection? It looks like it&#x27;s only 2 iOS devices doing this, all other devices remain consistently pingable.
 Device is iPhone 6 on iOS 12.5.7 - No Power Saving Options are on and the Phone is constantly plugged in.
 UAPSD is off
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have a hard time understanding the distinction between EVI and VNI in an EVPN network. The below link says, EVI ID autogenerates with the same value as a VNID. I understand VNID is what distinguishes a VLAN on a local switch (so each VLAN is given a L2VNI which is the VNID). The VNID is what is needed to distinguish routes when a leaf advertises any type EVPN route to the fabric. But if EVI and VNID are same, why should there be two terms?

                              <span>Is there software readily available (commercial or open-source) that can manage the ACL configuration for devices it has authority over, simple enough that I could expose it to low-level technical users. For example, if I have a contractor who needs to allow access between two endpoints, he doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to know anything about those endpoints except their names (to select them from an object-list), configure the required ports etc in a web-form, then the software will determine where policies need adding, and add them.
 Assuming there&#x27;s already a source of truth configured, and I just need the ACL configuration and deployment bit.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a question about what certificates I should have on a new pair of HA Palo Alto 3320&#x27;s that I&#x27;m setting up, these are severing as our hosted WAN firewalls, we&#x27;ll be doing SSL inbound inspection on them.
 The main caveat is that the hosted servers that users go to when they go through our hosted NAT rules, are all F5 VIP&#x27;s, normally, I would just be putting the servers pub/priv key pair of the firewalls, but since none of them are technically where the user goes to when they establish an SSL connection, the F5 VIPs acts as the destination for the NAT rules whenever the hosting IP&#x27;s are connected to.
 It may seem like an obvious question, but in this case, don&#x27;t I just use the pub/priv keypair that are on the F5 client SSL profile instead of the servers certificates themselves in a normal instance?
 One bonus question as well, for the decryption policy on the PA, am I right in saying that the scr zone would be the outside, scr ip &quot;any&quot;, dst zone (the relevant next hop zone) and the dst ip as the private IP, being the VIP, not the public IP that users will connect to? (I guess the same sort of question applies to the NAT and security policy rules to, that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve currently set it all up)
 Thanks all

I can see how this might be useful during a configuration process, e.g. as a means of keeping bond settings around to copy from while configuring another, etc., but that&#x27;s just UI sugar.
 Is there any use case for keeping it this way? We&#x27;re trying to figure out if we want our GUI to even allow it. Our product owner thinks that CentOS accepting a single-interface configuration at all should be considered a bug in linux.

                              <span>Hello,
 This might be a stupid question... We are trying to upgrade from Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.9.1 to 3.10.3. I have never done this and documents explain how to backup 3.9, uninstall it, then install 3.10 and restore the backup into it. But doesn&#x27;t explain which version to use that is available on their website? We are using a VM to run out Prime Infrastructure at the moment and are going to use VM for the new version. Which version of Prime Infrastructure do I need? I see these:
  
Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 ISO image for the physical appliance. Run, openssl dgst -sha512 -verify CiscoPI3.10.pem -signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso.signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso from the command line.
 Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 OVA for the virtual appliance
  
From the names alone, it tells me I need to download #2. Is that correct?

                              <span>Hive mind,
 My long loved MRV LX4000 series console servers have been declared officially unsustainable by both the vendor and my management.
 I&#x27;ve got 10 of the 32 port version in my staging facility.
 What&#x27;re folks using these days? I&#x27;m hoping for a one-to-one replacement so I can just plug and pray and not have to redesign my OOBM infrastructure. (edit: Must be DoD-compliant / able to meet DISA STIGs)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Our IT vendor (not under contract with) is pricing out a new firewall and switches. Ours (Fortinet) is coming to end of support.
 We own a small commercial building with a little more than 48 ports in the building. 15 or so go to our own company, and the rest of the building is for executive suites that we rent out to tenants. One tenant may be solo, and another may be 3-4 employees. So whatever product we use needs to be able to isolate the tenants to their own secure network. Beyond this, fairly intuitive interface, good security, and any other bells and whistles that may be beneficial to an executive suites building would be great.
 All that said, they are suggesting Sonicwall. I get the sense that this is just who they&#x27;ve been using for a long time. They speak highly of the product they put out... but I did a little reading on a few posts and found they don&#x27;t have the best reputation compared to others. Maybe in those instances it was for larger clients with different needs... I don&#x27;t know these devices are a little outside my expertise :)
 Our building is pretty high end and I&#x27;d like our networking capabilities we offer to tenants to reflect that as well. Is Sonicwall a good choice, or are there options that we should definitely consider over them?
 Thanks for any and all feedback and opinions.

                              <span>Wondering if anyone might have any tips on an issue I am having with a S2S VPN between a Cisco ASA and a WatchGuard. 
 I manage the WatchGuard. Remote side IT manages the Cisco ASA. 
 We&#x27;ve had Cisco TAC and WatchGuard Support involved extensively and they can&#x27;t figure it out. Initially they thought it was a stuck SA instance, but remote Network Admin has checked that this time around and are not seeing anything like that. 
 We have a total of 6 active tunnels, 5 out of the 6 are working flawlessly and are stable. The 6th one, the WatchGuard will SEND from my end, but does not receive anything back from the ASA. 
 I&#x27;ve been through my config a dozen times and cannot find anything that would be preventing return traffic. To me, it feels like the ASA might have a broken return route back to the WatchGuard&#x27;s network on that specific subnet. 
 I am aware of the reputation WatchGuard has in this subreddit. Replacing the WatchGuard is not an option and I really think WatchGuard has made some stellar improvements over the last 5 years or so and are solid UTM Appliances. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Do all routers in a given area have to use the exact same key? Do all OSPF neighbours in a given area need to use the exact same authentication key, or is the authentication key only locally significant between 2 routers? If it matters, I&#x27;m using Extreme EXOS layer 3 switches.

 I am doing research into starting my own ISP to resell wholesale fibre products. 
 I am in the planning stage at the moment however I have noticed that to become a BT Wholesale Customer I need an OFCOM RID number, however in order to get a RID number I need to show an agreement with a PECN (i.e. in this case BT). 
 My background is more sales and marketing and I have never done this before. I am in effect looking (initially) to &quot;white label&quot; the BT product which I believe is possible. 
 Any guidance on this or consultants who can help are welcome :) 
 Cheers.

                              <span>Hey all, I am currently stuck trying to get an additional subnet advertised and talking to Cisco AnyConnect users. I have limited knowledge of ASAs (have mostly worked with PA&#x27;s in past).
 Here is how the subnets are being defined in access-list.
 #show run access-list VPN-SplitTunnel
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.36.41.0 255.255.255.0
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.101.0.0 255.255.255.0 
 The problem is after a user connects to the VPN, the new route does not show up in Windows route table.
 Where else do I need to add a route, so the users can receive the route.
 TiA.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not sure what open source package would suit my needs. We have a team of employees and volunteers spread across a few different business locations. They occasionally move from one location to another, and they tend to have very similar questions that our talent managers answer for them. I&#x27;m thinking something like resource management (or customer management, but used for employees?) along with a help desk. Are there any web-based solutions already built which might help us manage this? Preferably php/mysql?

                              <span>I got to the office this morning and someone from Finance asked me, &quot;Yo X, is our ERP up yet?&quot; I was confused. &quot;What do you mean, it&#x27;s up?&quot; She replied, &quot;You know, our ERP is down since 7.30 am.&quot;
 I checked and sure enough, our ERP was down. I panicked and started troubleshooting. The server was up and running, and the network was fine. I didn&#x27;t know what else to do, so I blamed our vendor. I sent them a WhatsApp message: &quot;Hey, what did you guys do? We can&#x27;t access our ERP.&quot; They replied, &quot;We didn&#x27;t do anything.&quot;
 I was at a loss. I continued troubleshooting, but people were starting to get angry and impatient. I remembered that our domain had expired on May 28, 2023, and today was June 2. The domain provider had auto-renewal enabled, but it was attached to one of our directors&#x27; credit cards. I called him, but he was still asleep. After 16 minutes of trying to wake him up, he finally renewed the domain. He mentioned that he forgot to change the card detail. 
 I waited patiently for the domain to come back up. My phone could access the ERP, but my laptop still couldn&#x27;t. I was about to start troubleshooting again when one of my managers said, &quot;Have you tried restarting DNS?&quot; I did, and it worked! Everyone was happy, and we hugged and celebrated.
 Just to share you my little achievement on Friyay morning

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Im looking for recommendations on a solution that can retrieve and store logs from office365, salesforce, and our firewalls. I was looking at Datadog, and betterstack but not sure how well and how the pricing works. 
 For example: - The audit logs or sign in logs for all users in azure active directory. 
  
SharePoint auditing as well like document editing, deletion, etc
 
Firewall changes, logons, etc
 
any changes made in Salesforce
 
We also have other applications that we may be able to work with vendors or their API that we would like events logged

                              <span>Basically what the title says. I&#x27;ve had days where I got about zero sleep the previous night, for one reason or another, and I know that I&#x27;m not going to be a very useful human approximation at work. I&#x27;ve debated calling in and using a sick day, but I&#x27;ve refrained from doing so for two reasons:
 1) It wouldn&#x27;t help me feel any better. When morning rolls around, that&#x27;s it. I can&#x27;t nap during the day without completely spoiling sleep the next night unless I&#x27;m actually sick. I&#x27;m not going to be able to do anything, so I may as well feel miserable and get paid instead of feeling miserable for free.
 2) We&#x27;ve got a small team, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to let them down. I really like my compatriots, and if I&#x27;m out then my share of the work gets dropped square in their laps. If I can grab that phone call from the capo di tutti capi, that lets everyone else keep their concentration on what&#x27;s important.
 I know that these sound contradictory, but it&#x27;s a matter of taking the smaller tasks that don&#x27;t require as much brainpower - stuff I&#x27;ve done a hundred times and is mostly muscle memory at this point - and either passing the challenging stuff off or sending bland updates that extend my deadlines.
 Basically, I&#x27;m asking for advice/anecdotes/etc. Thank you.

                              <span>Sometimes I want one ping only. So I use this alias in bash on Linux:
 alias vasili&#x3D;&#x27;ping -n -c 1&#x27; 
 For Windows and CMD, you can use:
 DOSKEY VASILI&#x3D;PING -n 1 $* 
 For PowerShell, you&#x27;ll need a function:
 function vasili { ping -n 1 $args } 
 I legitimately use this when troubleshooting some kinds of connectivity issues, and want a simple controlled test.

                              <span>You are stressed and over worked, always dealing with issues and never just a routine check up. Majority of L3 task lands on your plate as there is no other L3 tech. Yet the overlord still expects average 10-15 tickets completed per tech each day, so you&#x27;re forced to handle L1 and L2 to meet your quota. 
 Clients will snap at you believing that with a click of a mouse you should make miracles happen because you work for Magical Solution Provider but unbeknownst to them it&#x27;s a place where Most Sanity Perishes. 
 Breaking point is near so you request for new L3 techs to be hired and gifted with a response from the overlord &quot;sure that&#x27;s already in the process.&quot; 
 They will hire a handful of new minions and to your surprise...only ONE new L3 that deals only with onboarding and the other new condemned souls now come to you for salvation with issues they can&#x27;t handle. 
 You will be asked for your input to diagnose a problem, which you will give but yet be asked &quot;did YOU fix it?&quot;
 You sit and stare at your screen with realization you&#x27;re happy on weekends but severely depressed during the weekdays with ideas of stepping out at lunch time and never returning. 
 Have you been in the same spot and what did you do?

                              <span>So the topic itself is vague-centric, hopefully I can keep the post itself on track. I&#x27;ll try to keep it short but I am a known tangent enjoyer. 
 First &#x27;proper(?)&#x27; job in IT, was working for a UK Telecoms company as Customer Service for many years before this role I took late last year.
 The role is IT Service Delivery Administrator. In case that flags anything up for anyone, I know of ITIL, not studied it myself but my manager is going to put me up for it as our new HoIT is keen on adopting a structure pointed more to ITIL than it currently is. 
 So currently, some of my roles and responsibilities include (but not limited to):
 Managing the provision and return of equipment to staff. It&#x27;s more managing the tickets and just checking with the MSP like &quot;hey, we all good for next week&#x27;s star…</span>

 It’s canigothere.zip

 Any advice on how to find/fix them, and or retribution.(I&#x27;m leaning towards changing their desktop to say WSUS Cheater and locking it for them)
 Edit: You guys really showed up for this post, alot of great comments! Thanks

                              <span>Hi fellow sysadmins,
 I&#x27;ve recently acquired a couple of AHA374b GZIP accelerators for my personal servers. These cards were released a while back by Comtech&#x27;s AHA Products Group and boasted impressive compression and decompression speeds.I was pretty excited about the potential they could bring to my setup.
 Unfortunately, these cards have reached their end-of-life/end-of-service status and Comtech is unable/unwilling to provide any access to the related software and drivers.I&#x27;m in need of:
  
Linux, Windows, and Open Solaris reference drivers with source code
 Drivers and Plug-ins for Apache Web Servers
  
I was wondering if any of you had experience with these accelerators and might have these resources archived or know where to find them. I understand this is a long shot, but any information or assistance would be greatly appreciated.
 Also, if you&#x27;ve used these accelerators or something similar before, I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences – the good, the bad, and the ugly!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Below is the update we got from engineering. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
 Dell engineering team has provided an approved workaround to help mitigate, in most cases resolve, most short-term video loss with external monitors connected to your Dell docking station. This workaround involves a registry key designed to disable the Display Stream Compression (DSC) function which is used to increase the maximum available video bandwidth. Disabling DSC may have some negative impact to high-end, end user environments that are running 3 or more displays with higher resolutions or refresh rates such as 4k and above. We understand that having the full capabilities available for your hardware is important which is why we are positioning this registry key as a short-term work…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 We are a company of medium size and we are looking for a PAM solution. We would like to scout the market and compare opensource and non-opensource solutions. 
 Currently a Teleport solution exist for a small scale of the company but we are looking for other possibilities. 
 Thank you for your recommendation :)

                              <span>We need to pickup a small amount of laptops for some of our sales staff. We are talking maybe 3-5. I&#x27;ve been researching several options from Lenovo, Dell, and now Samsung. 
 As of right now, the Samsung Book3 Pro looks like the biggest bang for the buck. For about the same price as 11th and 12th gen laptops from Lenovo and Dell, I can get a 13th gen EVO laptop from Samsung with a better screen and webcam (they&#x27;ll be using webcam quite a bit).
 I will say, I do personally own a Book3 for home use and really like it but it does come with a ton of Samsung bloat. But, that&#x27;s nothing a reimaging can&#x27;t fix.
 Has anyone delt with Samsung business, particularly their laptops, in their environment? If so, what has your experience been? Reliability, warranty replacement, support, etc...

                              <span>Sent a potential client an email with a PDF attachment from my email address last week. I waited a few days for response, then got on the phone with him to find out my email ended up in his spam folder.
 Kind of embarrassing but anyway... why spam?
 Info:
  
This is the first time I sent an email to the specific person&#x27;s email address (maybe attachment and first time sending flagged it, or my wording?)
 I have DKIM, SPF, and DMARC active. my (self hosted email) uses MailGun for outgoing mail. 
 I was curious if it may have went to spam possibly when I didn&#x27;t hear back for a few days, but I get DMARC reports daily and double checked the report on this message, all passed.
  
dmarc - https://imgur.com/aLUuKxp
 I never had any issues with MailGun&#x27;s rotating sending IP addresses (in dmarc report). Sent other emails recently to new addresses with attachments and they replied no problem. The only thing I can think of is maybe his I.T. admin has Outlook spam settings set ridiculously strict?
 I set up mail open/click tracking, which may help a a little (assuming receivers don&#x27;t have images blocked by default), but still curious why this may have happened.
 Thanks and I appreciate any ideas you share

                              <span>Just fishing for ideas here - we have a ye olde legacy environment that has some ancient Domain Controllers that we&#x27;re finally getting around to replacing.
 As it&#x27;s on an ancient environment the people who know about it have long gone so we&#x27;re doing a bit of homework first and we need to determine what&#x27;s actually using the DCs to work out what the risk is.
 I&#x27;m not overly concerned about the actual domain authentication itself as that&#x27;ll generally just work itself out, I&#x27;m mainly concerned about LDAP and DNS - is there anything else i&#x27;m overlooking here?
 I can turn on the LDAP event logging to identity anything doing LDAP queries, not so sure about capturing DNS queries though...the Windows stuff will be fine, it&#x27;s weird stuff like Wireless Access Points and other appliances i&#x27;m concerned about.
 Any other stuff i should be on the lookout for?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have an HPE msa 2050 sas on which I have configured a sas connection with 3 hosts. Connections in the host tab showed up automatically. I connected the machines one by one (first the first port from controller A to the first host, port configuration on the device, then the first port from controller B to the first host, port configuration on the device, and then the next server). Connections look fine. From these hosts, I created a FOC group on the hpe msa 2050 and mapped the drives to this group. Then I set up a cluster failover on Windows Hyper-V 2019. Cluster passed the verification without errors, disks from the array connected without a problem, migration between machines works fine, but one thing worries me, when I run the get-initiatorport command in powershell on node 1 and node 3, it shows me nothing, while on node 2 it shows me all connections. It seems to me that on each server should be visible two connections and not all on one host. 
 Can someone confirm to me if the configuration on HPE is good or has anyone encountered something like this and is it normal?

                              <span>Hi guys, we have a Logitech Expansion Mic for Group and we&#x27;re struggling to set it up. The cable we need is 5sm too short. Are there any cable extensions available for it? Because from what I&#x27;ve seen, a 10-meter cable costs $150 USD. Is there any cheaper cable or extension that I can use?

 As you understand from title , If I set DisplayName attribute of Security Group in AD then Outlook Contact Card is showing Global Security Group (no mail-enabled security group).
 has anyone seen this before?
 Is it normal ? So expected behaviour?
 thanks,

                              <span>Hi guys have some question, i will be task to switch license (bulk) from teams room standard to pro due to change of license. Typically this is just a simple task below are the existing setting:
  
room account has been license explicitly and not using any grouping.
 license expiring soon
 purchase new license
  
My plan is to create a group and assign the license to the group in bulk. then once successful, remove the existing license. However, i understand that to avoid service interruptions, removal and assignment of license should be done on one command. Will i be running into some issue if i add first and remove license later?

                              <span>My team is currently trying to roll out passwordless MFA but are having issues with some users trying to enable phone sign-in inside the Microsoft Authenticator app. For some users, it works like a dream straight off the bat. For others though it is a real pain in the arse.
 We are going to the security info page to add an authentication method (Microsoft authenticator app). Once added we then enable passwordless phone sign-in. The app displays a two-digit number which is entered in and then the phone is registered. The app shows that passwordless sign-in is enabled. However, when a user tries to sign in for the first time, they receive a message stating &#x27;something has gone wrong on our side&#x27;. 
 Phone sign-in is then disabled and the user needs to re-enable phone sign-in to try again but this process seems to repeat after every login attempt, and we are unable to see why in the sign-in logs. 
 Users have either a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license or a Microsoft 365 Business Standard + Azure Active Directory Premium P1 License. They are also put into an MFA enablement group which is linked to a CAP. As I stated at the beginning some users it works like a dream, with no obvious differences in user setup. I would appreciate any insight you may have.

                              <span>Good Moring Admins, Looking for some advice in merging 2 file systems with windows server 2012r2 (i know, its been mentioned, plan is to upgrade in the coming months)
 Long short, we had a dr situation, new host has arrived, we have moved over the drives from a backup, but as the system cant have much down time, its about 24 hours out of date.
 So i attempted to use robocopy and a few others which all seem to fail and have the same issue. File path lengths and names.
 System has about 30 shares on it with stupid long paths, all of these programs tell me it cant copy because of length, there does not look like a way around this like there is with newer os version. 
 Can anyone advise a way around this.

 I tried to setup a Windows 10 domain joined machine with EDGE KIOSK MODE but it will not open the Web URL with SSO but when we setu the same on Chrome KIOSK mode it was possible to login to web URL via SSO.
 Is Edge chromium not supp SSO in KIOSK mode?

 ​
 For a customer i&#x27;d like to disable/grey out the possibility to change any VPN settings in the VPN settings panel in W11. Is there an existing setting to push this in Intune, or perhaps the possibility to push this via a OMA URI or script?

                              <span>Hello,
 im facing a really strange behavior with Server 2022 and RDP connections.
 Im running on VMWare ESXi 7.0 U2 with Server 2022 Datacenter. The problem occurs randomly on the servers and can be mostly forced by decreasing the hardware of the server to the minimum.
 Once i connect the following screen appears:
 https://imgur.com/a/xH4LtZQ
 checking the logs showing me a strange messages which not occour when the login succeeds. For eg:
 https://imgur.com/a/O1c1scZ
 On several hosts i moreover faced the problem showing a disconnected user using 50% of the CPU. Once i kill the high CPU process the session is killed
 https://imgur.com/a/VdQsxKa
 I appreciate any feedback or ideas to solve the issues. I already tried may things to rule out the problem such as deploying the image from a new clean iso, setting up the vm without domain join etc. Nothing yet helped me the locate the source of the issue.
 Regards

                              <span>Hi gang,
 Apologies if this is not quite on topic. We have an internal application. One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.
 At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before &#x27;printing&#x27; them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.
 This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can &#x27;print&#x27; a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.
 Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product. I&#x27;m open to anything be it subscription or a once-off, as long as it&#x27;s regularly maintained and patched. TIA.

                              <span>Recently, our company moved the DNS server to AWS. 
 After that some of our users can not access the company website.
 They still can access any other website, however they can not access our company website. 
 And I found that all users who are having trouble are using Comcast as the ISP. 
 I did flushdns, delete cache, open with a different browser, modem/computer reset. but it didn&#x27;t work. 
 When I reached out to the Comcast customer service, they only talked about Modem Status. 
 Any Ideas ?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Good day all, we just had a planned power outage on the complex where our office was located. Ever since the power is back on, our patch panel has become very noisy. It wasn&#x27;t like this before the power outage. Any thoughts on this? Thanks.

                              <span>Retail SMB, 34 locations. Current equipment per location: EdgeRouter 4, UniFi Switch 24 (non-PoE), single UniFi NanoHD AP, 5G failover router, ~4-10 desktops, ~4-10 VoIP handsets, ~2-3 network printers, ~15-20 WiFi devices, camera NVR, traffic counter, digital signage, credit card machine.
 Current Specs: Internet varies from 200Mbps to 1Gbps (max) symmetrical fiber, 6 VLANs, 2 WiFi networks, port isolation. Locations are completely independent -- no interconnection between locations, no VPNs, no internal file shares, etc). No servers -- all hosted services and applications. No printing over WiFi. Short throw for AP&#x27;s -- long range not needed but WiFi speed is a priority. ~6-12 PoE capable devices: VoIP handsets, WiFi AP, traffic counter. Router cloud management - UISP via Ubiquiti (free). Switch/AP cloud management - UniFi controller via HostiFi ($50/mo).
 Current equipment has been pretty reliable overall. Never had a router go bad. Occasionally an AP/switch will disconnect from the controller and will have to be re-added via SSH.
 Would like to get a next gen firewall, PoE switch and WiFi 6 for each location, all cloud managed. Open to cloud firewall-as-a-service but don&#x27;t know much about them. Stick with Ubiquiti or not? What products/stack would you recommend?
 Have looked at Calyptix AccessEnforcer, Fortinet, and am intrigued by Firewalla Gold (bought a demo unit but haven&#x27;t plugged it in); Meraki Go line looks interesting. Open to suggestions.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am working on redesigning the network layout in the local government building where I work. We currently have 3 network closets, the Basement and most of the first floor go to the IT office, The Tax office has its own network closet with a cat5e connection back to the IT office, and the 2nd floor has one also with a cat5e connection back to the IT office.
 I want to make a change and have 4 network closets with fiber links all back to the IT office
 finance (Basement)
 1st floor
 Tax
 2nd floor
 My question is what would be the benefit of having a fiber switch in the IT office connecting all the switches together VR just connecting the switches&#x27; SFP ports 
 Switches I will be using.
 JetStream 28-Port Gigabit Smart Switch with 24-Port PoE+ (port amount may very) 
 Fiber Switch
 TP-Link JetStream TL-SX3008F V1 - switch - 8 ports - managed
 ​
 Thank you for your insight 
 BIT

                              <span>I entered the technology field in 2020, working as a dev intern. I&#x27;ve always had a passion for computers, networks, and programming, and shortly after, I started working with DevOps. Since last year, I have been working as an AppSec Engineer.
 Although I enjoy the technical aspect, I see it more as a hobby. Honestly, I have never felt completely satisfied working in this area, and I have always aspired to move into a management or consulting role once I gained more experience.
 I enjoy working with people and I am quite sociable. I hold certifications such as CCNA, Security+, and CySA+. So my question is: am I still too inexperienced to transition into pre-sales?
 I often read that this role requires a lot of technical knowledge, but when would be the ideal time to make the change?
 TL;DR: I have 3 years of experience in tech (1 year as a developer intern and 1 year in cybersecurity). I am not satisfied with the technical work and want to transition into pre-sales. Do I still lack enough experience, or is it possible?

                              <span>I have been trying to understand usecase for secondary IP on an SVI, but looking up, I could find 2 reasons: migration and redundancy. I don&#x27;t see how redundancy is offered by having a secondary IP in that if the interface goes down, we loose both the primary and secondary IPs right? Is there something I am missing?

 Has anyone had any experience with building IPSec tunnels on Palo Alto firewalls and then trying to send multicast traffic through them? Specifically I am talking about the Speakerbus appliance used in the securities/stock trading industry. We are having the absolute worst time where nothing we try works. We&#x27;ve tried GRE over IPSec, changing MTUs, convert rules to Any/Any, reviewing logs but nothing seems to be giving us a clue as to where traffic is being dropped. 
 Could definitely use some help/advice.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have a Meraki deployment for SDWAN/edge firewall at my remote sites. I want to explore other options. Who have you all used and who do you like? Is Palo Alto or Fortigate any good?
 I would prefer one that can do segmentation on the LAN and separate rulesets per Vlan or interface. Cloud-managed would be nice too.

                              <span>Hello r/networking
 I might be late to the 100G train but here I am. I have a NAS shipping with 100G Aruba HPE 100Gb QSFP28 MPO SR4 100m Transceiver SKU# 845966-B21
 From my research this is has an MPO-12 connector. 
 For the switch side, I had purchased AMQ28-SR4-M1 transceivers (10Gtek, I already have good experience with their 10G model) which apparently have an MPO-8 connector.
 Following further research, I found out that MPO-12 has 4 fibers in the middle that aren&#x27;t used, thus only 8 fibers are needed.
 My obvious question is, do these 2 transceivers work together? What type of cable is needed?

                              <span>Our WAN has been upgraded to 10G fiber but the LAN runs from an existing managed 1G switch. Is there any upside to connecting all 4 1G ports on the router to the switch and configuring link aggregation?

 Intel NIC Family Version 21.5.0 Firmware for X710, XXV710, and XL710 adapters - 9th Nov 2022
 https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-au/drivers/driversdetails?driverid&#x3D;gxj5g
 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80
 Current release: v3.1.80
 vs the current latest (at time of posting):
 Intel NIC Family Version 22.0.0 Firmware for X710, XXV710, and XL710 adapters - 10th Apr 2023
 https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-au/drivers/driversdetails?driverid&#x3D;gxj5g
 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80
 Current release: N/A
 Similarly for the latest &quot;Intel NIC Family Version 22.0.0 Firmware for I350, I354, X520, and X550&quot; also released 10th Apr 2023, where the previous version was v3.1.80 and current is N/A.
 I have firmware upgraded a &quot;Intel(R) Ethernet 10G 4P X710/I350 rNDC&quot; and a &quot;Intel(R) Gigabit 4P I350-t Adapter&quot; and confirm that the iSCSI Boot Option ROM disappeared after upgrading versions 20.5.0 &gt;&gt; 22.0.0 on both cards.
 I would imagine that iSCSI Boot is still supported perhaps, but how would one configure it and see settings? It&#x27;s strange that there&#x27;s no other mention of this at all in the release notes, other than the current release being &quot;N/A&quot;.
 I am not currently using this functionality but have in the past. It&#x27;s quite concerning when features just disappear with no explanation or justification!!

 It says the vulnerability has the capability of escalated privileges and potential unwanted unauthorised access?

                              <span>Today a non-tech C-Level Officer ask me to give him back Super Admin in Google Workspace to view the users calendar. When I joined I removed all the Super Admins for all non technical users because we all now Super Admin Permissions are powerfull.
 Now he stil ask and says Give me Super Admin then. Sadly Google Does not offer am role that allows the view of all users calendars.
 Any ideas how I should react? Do you guys haveing any tips?

                              <span>I am finally leaving the terrible, dumpster fire company I work for. I am a one person IT department. I haven&#x27;t told them I&#x27;m leaving yet, going to give 3 weeks notice when I do, and offer remote support for a short period of time in order to smoothly transition my replacement. I have nothing bad to say about my coworkers, the job is just genuinely burning me out and altering my mental health. I need to leave. 
 Before I give my notice, I am preparing extensive and updated documentation to give my replacement. This company had NO documentation post-2017 since I started, so it&#x27;s a lot of updating that stuff too. I&#x27;m basically doing it all from scratch so the new guy isn&#x27;t fucked like I was. 
 So, r/sysadmin, what stuff am I forgetting to put in there? I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something. Write down every base I need to cover so I literally don&#x27;t forget anything.

Pro subscription is like the entry gate at the amusement park, and I don&#x27;t have a ticket, so I&#x27;ll be saying goodbye to a few remaining old cloud beavers soon and wish the best to my fellow intrepid sysadmins who are still in it for the pro beaver ride!

I responded politely to advise that the former Administrator was no longer with the company in our IT department and that we were perfectly happy with our current adobe creative suite licensing in the portal and had no plans to add additional licenses or remove any currently allocated licenses. Thought that was the end of it, I periodically get this type of email from current or former vendors we do or have done business with in the past. I got a response with another email that had been CCed telling me to refer to the linked items for our licensing agreement and that this was not a sales email and the meeting and Audit are required.
 Apparently they haven&#x27;t been doing audits the past seven years and now they&#x27;re doing them again.
 We only have a small number of licensed users with the full adobe creative suite which is licensed through their portal user accounts, and each user has a single activated computer or laptop (marketing team members who do graphics or video editing).
 Has anyone been able to professionally and politely tell these guys to go pound sand?
 I didn&#x27;t care much for the prickly response from them. Had they worded their original email different and told me it was time for a mandatory audit to begin with I would have responded accordingly. The times they requested for possible dates for the meeting fall during my vacation cruise and I handed it off to our IT director to schedule and have the meeting.
 I am pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a scam, but it sure feels that way.

                              <span>For energy saving reasons, we use Wake on Lan on our backup server so that it&#x27;s only running when it needs to. This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.
 At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It&#x27;s a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn&#x27;t reproduce that behaviour.
 Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we&#x27;re just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don&#x27;t exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.
 But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?
 ​
 EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.

                              <span>For the longest time at any job I’ve been at, the buck stopped with me. I was always the most knowledgeable on the systems and was able to quickly determine the issue and fix the problem or tell the help desk crew how to fix it. The company is growing, and while I am still the senior engineer for all of the servers and infrastructure, I am being told to start looping in other help desk people in on new systems. The thought is to push the mundane, low hanging tasks to the help desk and keep me doing the architecting and high level tasks. I know that it’s a good thing, for both myself and the members of the help desk, but I feel that I am losing control and won’t be able to be the knowledgeable one anymore.
 How have you gotten past this and been able to be at ease?

Nothing is showing up in either the SpamTitan logs or the Exchange Online message trace. I&#x27;ve contacted the vendors and spoken with them *as they were sending the emails out*, and we have not received anything, nor have they shown up in logs. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Anyone have any ideas? I&#x27;m at a complete loss right now.

I was wondering are there any services that we can look inti which offer to store and manage the laptops in our behalf . I&#x27;ve already checked into Hofy but it cannot entirely solve our problems as we want to be able to have the laptops as our property. So we are looking for something or someone with a business that stores the laptops and receives them from employees leaving and gives them to new hires.

                              <span>Hi! I have the task to implement GCPW for all our windows devices.
 We&#x27;ll be using it for some extra security, easier remote work etc for 80-100 users that work remotely. 
 So my question now is, how would I go forward with rolling out this update to my users? 
 I don&#x27;t want them all to download the GCPW client themselves and install, neither do I want to do it for them manually, one by one. 
 We have no device management where we can roll out software. All our computers are just set up as a normal PC. 
 Would it be smart to write a powershell script that will download the GCPW client and install? 
 I pray that you, the sysgods have a solution, thanks!

                              <span>The April 2023 Epyc 2nd gen revision guide has errata #1474:
 Description
 A core will fail to exit CC6 after about 1044 days after the last system reset. The time of failure may vary depending on the spread spectrum and REFCLK frequency.
 Potential Effect on System
 A core will hang.
 Suggested Workaround
 Either disable CC6 or reboot system before the projected time of failure.
 Fix Planned
 No fix planned
 Despite what they say, the problem actually manifests at 1042.5 days. The TSC ticks at 2800 MHz, and 2800 * 10**6 * 1042.5 days almost equals 0x380000000000000, which has too many zeros not to be a coincidence.
 Note that your server will almost definitely hang, requiring a physical (or IPMI) reboot, because no interrupts, including NMIs, can be delivered to the zombie cores: this means no scheduler, no IPIs, nothing will work.
 Either disable the CC6 (as you did with the Zen CPUs IIRC), or just reboot the damn thing, it&#x27;s been three years already, you&#x27;re missing out on a lot of security patches.
 Please read erratas before you start digging, it&#x27;ll save you at least a day of debugging :(

                              <span>The offline root CA and the online enterprise CA both are virtualized. The enterprise issuing CA will be running in AWS as an EC2.
 Since they will not be installed on a physical servers and not even on the local on premises network, we cannot use the somewhat low cost YubiHSM that you can plug into a physical USB port. AWS has a Cloud HSM that we may be able to use with a EC2, but it’s about $1300 per month.
 So, assuming using an HSM is not possible, what can you do to secure the private keys as much as is practically possible? Just lock away the offline root, limit the network connectivity to the enterprise CA to minimums needed to function and limit the accounts that have access to the online enterprise CA with permissions to view or export the private keys (local admin rights)?

                              <span>Hey everyone. I’m trying to disable Windows sign in using PIN and leaving only the username and password but everything I’ve done so far doesn’t seem to work. Long story short, client recently enabled Azure AD sync and all of their PCs started asking for PIN set up upon sign in next morning. They don’t want to use PIN and only a password and I’m not sure where PIN requirement came from.
 I assumed it was due to Windows Hello for Business feature in Azure AD so I disabled it. Only 7 computers have been set up with a PIN and I’m trying to switch back to passwords.
 The computers are unmanaged in Azure. I have tried disabling all policies on affected machines that have anything to do with a password (Logon PIN, Windows Hello for Business). Also disabled “sign in options” registry key.
 After doing all that upon login certain users are still prompted for a PIN. I think it has something to do with Azure since they are Azure AD synced and my admin account is not so I never getting prompted but I just can’t find what’s enabled.
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello influential minds that are smarter than me,
 The company I work for is about 400 + company and has people onboarding and offboarding frequently. The previous admin had us doing manual Outlook emails to personal email addresses. The issue is that from time to time someone forgets to change the UN email in the template that we send out and it makes the department look bad.
 is there any way to automate welcome emails with specific attachments, we are an MS Tennent and use a third party licensor for our scheme called Appriver. Shot in the dark but just thought I would ask

                              <span>I recently setup &quot;report phishing&quot; in 365 and have that dumping to a shared mailbox I have access to. I have it set to report locally and to MS. Everything seems to be working OK with that; however, I didn&#x27;t really think about if there&#x27;s anything we need to do when a user incorrectly reports a message. I sent out a phishing sim a couple weeks ago and now the users are all hyper sensitive. I don&#x27;t want to misclassify ham as spam...used to be a big problem when we used Bayesian filters if we trained them wrong.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>It will be 2nd month as a associate sysadmin.Just to be clear there is no Senior sysadmin so i am responsible for all the tasks and tickets. They won&#x27;t take my advice on IT change like deciding which brand laptop for new joining but want me to mail the financial team on new laptop which they decide. After hiring here are the things i have done. Setup the fully functioning Ticketing system, Set of Assets management services which thanks to you guys i make them to use Snipe IT, Handle all the day to day task like fixing printer, access management. Since all things are cloud based so there is no AD to manage even though i deeply want to learn AD to myself more useful for future. Keep track of Assets. Change windows os, change battery of mouse. Hand jira related task since i am the global admin. I am getting more frustrated with day passes by. I choose to be sysadmin because of this reddit not joking.220$ is not enough to sustain a month even though dollar exchange rate is high here.If they only increase my pay to $400 it would be enough for myself to sustain a month.Also they promise me i would be provided with course i wanna join but turns out i am not getting any.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We host internally a document management system and the creators of this system offer an externally hosted solution to allow us to share our documents to customers/3rd parties via a web portal (in loose terms).
 Now I&#x27;ve been tasked with configuring this (I&#x27;ve already voiced my concerns that exposing anything to internet is a bad idea but here we are). 
 The system sits inside our lan, behind a watchguard firewall, internally it&#x27;s running IIS, I need a real world address to resolve to this internal website (i have a dns record setup pointing to our edge IP), I only want to allow one IP external address (or DNS) incoming to access this web server (hoping to make it as secure as possible).
 Would a simple 1 to 1 nat rule suffice, or is there a better smarter way of doing this?

 RANT WARNING: 
 We use Teamviewer for remote support as well as patch management and remote scripting. 
 Converting clients to the newly updated interface is longwinded when it works, but lots of our devices have failed to update with no explanation as to why. 
 The clients listed in the management console application only seem to show up half the time. And often assett lists fail to load anything at all. 
 Adding to all this the navigation is very unintuituive. It took me 5 minutes to find where to execute a script. It is done from the list of company devices and hidden under a drop down, not the remote scripting tab (why??????). 
 Congratulations TeamViewer, you have turned a mediocre patch management system into a terrible one. I&#x27;m open to change, but your UI is now utter garbage. 
 Thank god our contract is up for renewal in a few months.

                              <span>My whole career has been in IT. Started out repairing computers in 1991 and worked up to an IT Manager overseeing a large public organization’s infrastructure. I&#x27;m basically just a &quot;crusty old Cisco guy&quot; when you get right down to it. I&#x27;m likely older than a lot of folks on here (51) with about five years left before I can retire. I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone in my shoes has ever made the switch from IT to a &quot;real&quot; job? 
 We have an Energy Manager position opening up later this summer. My degree (from 1993) is in Electrical Engineering. I&#x27;ve worked on enough Facilities projects over the years that I could likely put together a good enough functional resume to at least sit an interview. Honestly though, as weird as this sounds, I&#x27;m not sure what people outside IT really do? The thought of not being responsible 24x7x365 for umpteen thousands of end-users seems a bit surreal. Not thanklessly fielding after-hours calls, giving up PTO because of unexpected issues/projects, or measuring success with anything other than network uptime all seem like foreign concepts to me. 
 If you&#x27;ve left IT after a substantial period, what were some of the things that surprised you? Would you share some of your experience with me on that transition? Thanks in advance to anyone that responds and hope everyone has a good day.

                              <span>This happened this morning, i came to work. Checked my e-mail to see a new question had appeared. Someone had gotten a phishing e-mail and asked if it was legit; spolier it wasnt. So i quickly respond to him: «No thats a phishing email, just report it.» Not thinking about it anymore, maybe 1 hour goes by or so and i recieve another e-mail, me not paying attention manage to open the attatchment from the previous mentioned e-mail. It took 1.1 ms to register what i had just done, it didnt even manage go load up before i managed to close it.
 Seeing as i have no idea what was contained in that file i had to go through the entire checklist
 Virus scan
 Reset passwords of other accounts which have been used on that computer/browser
 Check network logg
 Check registry logg
 Reinstall Windows.
 My biggest fear was that i was logged into Intune on an admin account if they could have hijacked the session.
 I sent the contents of the file to someone who could deobfuscate it:
 It just redirected you to a phishing website, no hidden malware.
 TLDR; Opened a phishing attachment and had to reset a lot of passwords and reinstall windows.
 Always pay attention, missclicks happen. And always delete emails containing phishing files/malware.

                              <span>Hi there, i have a customer with Intune Managed Devices which are connected to a OnPrem Exchange hosted on our end. The problem now is, that as soon as we set a shared Mailbox to auto connect to User Mailboxes the Shared Mailbox connects to the Users Outlook Profile, but than starts requesting a Password even if the user has full access to the Shared Mailbox. If we turn off auto connect for that Shared MB and add it manually to the Users Outlook, there will be no PW request at all. We tried, cleaning old PW locally and also recreated the Outlook Profile without any luck. The same happens also with a non domain/non Intune Managed Private device. Anyone has an idea where that behavior is coming from? Thank you very much guys!

                              <span>If you rename the PC after joining, looking up the user still shows the old name for the device. One way to fix is dsregcmd /forcerecovery requires you to sign in again, basically unjoins &amp; rejoins the user [a leave and join in one step so you aren&#x27;t left dangling outside the domain without an admin account]. 
 The simpler command dsregcmd /UpdateDevice made the PC name change propagate to Azure!

 We have some CAD software that&#x27;s MAC Locked and also protected by a USB dongle. I know how to sort this in Hyper V but I am having zero luck getting USB to work. The Dell servers are all in Lockdown mode for IdRAC - Not sure if this disables USB. Additionally, I cant find a setting to allow USB passthru in Windows Admin Centre. I&#x27;ve tried connecting with Hyper-V manager directly to one of the nodes but this fails.
 Any Ideas?

                              <span>We haven&#x27;t gone too in-depth with proper foresight into getting our Active Directory into tip-top shape. Now we need to really revisit how we have structured our AD OUs in a much better way. From a top-level OU structure, we are planning to have the DC site location with the structure as -
 Site-Location:
 OU Level 1- Building/Office 
 OU Level 2 --Department
 OU Level 3 ---Users/Computers
 We have some challenges here and not sure if the above structure will work:
  
Some buildings/offices may have a mixture of different departments that exist in other buildings/offices in the same site.
 Some users may be in multiple departments, so should we create all department containers in all buildings/offices as a pre-step to avoid extra work in the future?
 Some &quot;special category&quot; computer group policies we have applied to specific department machines which should not apply to all departments, would it be wise to create OU Level 4 for these machines? Specific policies are for example: Exceptions to Windows Screen lock-out, Allowing phones to be tethered to CPUs, Allowing USB access. This would create the GPO mapping side to be a little more tedious for us. So trying to prevent as much work as possible here.
  
Any suggestions on proper structuring from AD Veterans would help. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I am in the process to learn MS Azure SC-300 Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator for my certificate and i was wondering:
 Almost everyone I know uses username + password + 2fa code at once OR username + password &gt; 2fa code.
 Lets say a hacker tries to get in with username and password. Since the 2fa comes later, it is possible for him to know, if the password he brute forced is right or not...?
 Why dont organisations do username &gt; 2fa code &gt; password?
 So they wont know if the pw was right or not and 2fa code is changing all the time anyway?
 Thanks in advance.

 Good morning everyone! Let me pic your brain. I have a situation where we need to access (provide support) to different customers but many of them refuse to have an active connection.
 Let me explain better, we need to be able to dial into windows machines on our customer networks but they refuse to have a site to site VPN, client to site, team viewer, RDP etc… they want to have an in demand solution where we only access when they allow us to. Quick support isn’t an option as we cant control the device per se. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do that natively?
 I am trying to get my head around it but any ideas would be more than welcome

                              <span>Hi everybody!
 ​
 I have an strange issue i cant find much information about on the internet.
 I did a dhcp / print server migration a couple of days ago on 2 locations.
 Exported the dhcp settings with powershell and imported to new one.
 DHCP is working fine , and clients are getting IP:s from the new servers.
 The servers are authorized and i can see them in the list of authorized servers.
 After the migration i cant see any scopes anymore (this worked before migration) , only on one location (1 out of 6) and thats the head office dhcp server.
 Red &quot;Stop sign&quot; over the dhcp server and says &quot;There are no items to show in this view&quot;.
 I can see the scopes locally on the server but not from my own computer with RSAT tools.
 ​
 I´ve tried running as different users / run as admin.
 Rebooted servers.
 Reauthorized DHCP servers.
 ​
 But still no luck. Anyone know what could cause this?

                              <span>Little bit of context : in the case of a good company, with good actual protections and an EDR (BitDefender), do you think there is a big security issue of getting an MDR with an external SOC ?
 What are the risks in your opinion, for a rgpd ruled company so no company data can normally go to the SOC company ?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have been asked to assist with configuring some SPAN/RSPAN ports, and while I&#x27;ve done some basic SPAN configuration before, this project is quite large. The project covers 4 different facilities and quite large networks. We&#x27;re still a little ways out from configuration, but I&#x27;m trying to do some homework so I&#x27;m more prepared when we get to configuration.
 The basic SPAN/RSPAN stuff seems fairly simple and straightforward, but I guess what I&#x27;m struggling to find is any documentation or literature on how to properly &quot;place&quot; SPAN and RSPAN ports/configuration. Mostly just some considerations or best practices for properly and efficiently designing a SPAN/RSPAN configuration. If anyone has any resources, please share!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 I was hoping to get some opinions for a situation I can&#x27;t seem to explain to some of our datacenter folks.
 I help implement and maintain our company&#x27;s large private backbone/MPLS Network (let&#x27;s call this out enterprise environment). We have two Datacenters utilizing Cisco ACI with 100G DCI between them. I&#x27;m not a data center guy, I&#x27;m a transport/radio guy.
 My task is to properly connect the MPLS environment to the two Datacenters. (Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I&#x27;m up.
 My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that&#x27;s good design, I didn&#x27;t set it up and I don&#x27;t know DC/ACI. I&#x27;d almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)
 Regardless, I&#x27;d set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.
 What general approach would you all take to this? I can provide more details if needed just let me know. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a client that has their Office365 tools in a cloud instance with whitelisting. In order to whitelist IPs for our remote workers we have to split tunnel that MS Traffic in to exit our ISP for the whitelisting. 
 I&#x27;m using Palo Alto Global Protect and domain forwarding to accomplish this since there are regional IPs all over and VPN users all over. 
 I&#x27;ve basically added every domain found here: 
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams
 This seems to work for the whitelisting, I can see the traffic come in and out and it satisfies the client logon. However active Outlook and Teams sessions seem to go offline and can&#x27;t show online anymore. I&#x27;ve gone through all sorts of logs and captures and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to narrow down what and why this is happening. Nothing is getting blocked so the only thing I can think of so far is that there is some traffic that is getting missed (either not on the urls listed above, or direct IPs not getting DNS resolved) and splitting the traffic between two egress points causing the session issues. I&#x27;m trying to get something setup to where I can test and capture myself so I don&#x27;t have to rely on client interactions but for now I thought I&#x27;d see if anyone has run into this issue. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if there are less domains I can split just for the login and leave all the others.

 I wanted to ask if I can transfer IPv4 Broadcasts and Unicasts over IPv6 adresses via a 4over6 Tunnel if the two clients don&#x27;t have native IPv4.
 If yes is there a builtin powershell command for creating such a tunnel on windows os?
 For example in Linux it can be done like this.
 /sbin/ip tunnel add  mode ip4ip6 remote  local  /sbin/ip -6 tunnel add ip6tnl1 mode ip4ip6 remote  local  /sbin/ip link set dev ip6tnl1 up /sbin/ip -6 route add 
 dev ip6tnl1 metric 1

                              <span>Hey there! I hope there are still a few souls out there using WhatsUp Gold and might be able to help me out. Our WUG setup predates me, but since I&#x27;ve started we&#x27;ve begun to use NetBox as our source of truth. I&#x27;d like to setup a custom link so that when we view devices in NetBox, there&#x27;s a link to the same device in WUG. My problem is that I can&#x27;t really seem to find any consistent URL convention that will link to WUG; it seems like any links I try always go to the device I last logged into. Fwiw, we are running the 2021 edition. If anyone has any insight on where this is possible, I&#x27;d appreciate it.

 If I have a 100GB QSFP with an MPO cable breaking out into 4x LC cables, if I only connect one leg would it be correct to assume the max bandwidth I can achieve is 25gb?
 Same with 400gb QSFP breaking out into 4x LC cables. Max bandwidth being 100gb unless I use multiple legs. 
 Is this correct or am I making an incorrect assumption here?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m playing around with my datacenter lab environment and stumbled upon a problem. Lets say my ISP gave me the IPs 192.0.2.10-192.0.2.20 in the 192.0.2.0/24 subnet (192.0.2.1 is the gateway).
 I want to route 192.0.2.11-192.0.2.20 over 192.0.2.10. Sadly I cannot add a route to the gateway statically or with something like bgp. 
 If I assign the IPs to the router, it doesn&#x27;t forward the packets because they are (from the routers perspective) at the destination.
 If I use KeepaliveD to fill the ARP Cache of the Gateway and then remove the address from the interface it works until the cache gets cleared. 
 The Router runs VyOS (a Debian based Firewall / Router). 
 Any Ideas and Tips are welcome :)

                              <span>Which mobile internet ISP can give me a /60 Prefix in Austria? I want to create different VLans for different components.
 I have asked drei.at , hot.at, magenta.at but no one of them could provide me the details.
 ISP drei and hot told me that they don&#x27;t provide ipv6 in the year 2023.
 Do you have any alterntives?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 We have been dealing with some issues regarding throughput on our 6e APs, leveraging the 6GHz spectrum. We are using a mix of Aruba 635 (2x2) and 655 (4x4) APs. Each AP offers 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz. We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).
 We&#x27;ve configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We&#x27;re seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you&#x27;d expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …</span>

                              <span>I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. 
 I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. 
 The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. 
 So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.
 What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?
 I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. 
 So what’s the better solution?

                              <span>The other day i asked something about DDoS related matters here. And i have strong assumption that it&#x27;s tcp/udp fragmentations after what you guys said there. I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s difficult to tell a good traffics and the bad traffics in TCP/UDP fragmentations attack.
 Is it possible to drop any incoming traffic to a certain IP that&#x27;s fragmented in Mikrotik Router? We want to find out if the service will still work correctly or not if we dropped fragmentation traffics to said IP. I&#x27;ve tried to google this, but either it&#x27;s not common practice or i&#x27;m not googling enough.
 My english is very limited so i might have used some uncommon terms there but i guess it&#x27;s still understandable.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with setting up some VLANs for a customer environment, and they use exclusively a digital phone system on their workstations instead of having physical phones on the desk. My general understanding is that in a setup with a physical phone you would send untagged traffic from the workstation and tag the voice traffic from the phone, and then they&#x27;ll stay separated over the trunk link back to the switch, but I&#x27;m unsure how to implement this when it&#x27;s just a single link between the workstation and switch - is it even possible? 
 Any tips would be greatly appreciated :)

                              <span>I feel that this is a dumb question, but can a layer 2 network switch prevent devices connected to it (not the management port) from being accessible on SSH, telnet, HTTPS, etc? From my understanding this is layer 7 stuff and a layer 2 switch would be oblivious to it. However, we&#x27;re having issues after a server was moved, it&#x27;s pingable, you can access port HTTPS which you get a &quot;Page Forbidden&quot;, but that is the server replying at the end of the day. My argument is that the switches are configured properly, all servers are pingable, anything else would be at the application level, AKA on the server.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;ve run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I&#x27;m primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I&#x27;m not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we&#x27;ve (I&#x27;ve) been slowly uncovering everything that&#x27;s been done here as necessary. To say it&#x27;s over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).
 Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP&#x27;s hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.
 The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP&#x27;s hardware?
 Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I&#x27;ve further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I&#x27;ve since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?
 Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Just a hypothetical - if there wasn&#x27;t anything stopping you and you could build out your dream ISP network servicing business customers, how would you do it? What services would you offer and what kinds of protocols/platforms/tech stack would you use to offer those services?
 (I realize the real world is full of constraints like exiting/legacy deployments, silos within a company slowing progress, cost of upgrading to newer equipment, etc... yet I&#x27;m curious what some people here would imagine as a really nice setup if they weren&#x27;t restricted by anything)

                              <span>Hey, I am just preparing for the CCNA exam and it was time for OSPF. 
 Routers with ospf exchange LSDB (Link State Database) between each other. Is there any chance to get access to this database ? To see what is inside ? Try to replace it ? I plan to run OSPF on Raspberry, cisco router and Microtic (because this is what I have) generate some traffic and then download LSDB and see what I can do with it hmmm....
 PS: i am not intrested about commend &#x27;show ip ospf db&#x27; more about some .db file hmm...

The only thing I can think of is that it could require increasing of MTU limit on both ends. But is there something more to it that could make it an unpreferable choice? Especially from security perspective.

                              <span>Trying to understand server OS licenses vs CALs.
 The CALs are purchased based on the number of users and devices accessing your servers regardless of having 2 servers of the same OS or older or 2,000 servers, correct?
 Then server OS licenses are based on the number of physical or virtual CPU cores in each server with a minimum of 8 per server? However, if you are running Windows Server Datacenter, you can buy Datacenter server licenses based on the number of physical cores on the host machines and that covers an unlimited number of virtual guest copies of the OS running on the hardware?

                              <span>Hey Folks, 
 So my CEO wants to send emails to our suppliers a few times a year. Mostly stuff like Merry Christmas, etc. 
 We recently had ATT Mark us as spammers because our webapp is sending ~280k emails a month that are mostly just &quot;Hey, Your Order Has Been Shipped&quot; or &quot;You requested to Reset Your PW - Here are instructions&quot; type stuff. Standard eCommerce Webapp emails. 
 My question is this -- would you allow a CEO to send to a standard contact group a few times a year... and then create the contact group and let them go crazy? Are there restrictions you would put on this? Would you insist it go through a marketing email campaign manager due to risk of reputational damage?
 ​
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m the solo IT guy at my company and while I have a year of experience in this environment, have my A+ and am currently studying for my Network+, and I do the work of network admin, help desk, IT manager etc, I know that I am not nearly experienced enough to know what a healthy IT environment looks like or how to correctly implement it. I inherited this system with no documentation, no backups, all the classics on here.
 I was fortunate to talk to some members of another institution similar to mine just up the road, and they offered for me to visit their site for a bird&#x27;s eye view of how they run things (thank God they took pity on me). I&#x27;m trying to make a list of things to ask and not ask - I don&#x27;t want to burn bridges by being invasive and I don&#x27;t want to walk over and say &#x27;teach me everything&#x27;, but at the same time I want to make sure I can benefit from this experience.
 If you had the chance to tour another IT environment and learn from it, what would you do?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the good fortune to get interviewed by a few recruiters over the past few months and the ones who didn&#x27;t push me through all said the same thing. I don&#x27;t have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn&#x27;t really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.
 I&#x27;ve been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.
 The problem seems to be that I don&#x27;t have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don&#x27;t believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.
 Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren&#x27;t in THAT specific industry? Using THEIR specific tech stack?
 Are they not understanding that the things I&#x27;ve done match their requirements (but on a smaller scale)?

 My work is divesting company A, 300 users. Company B will not be providing SharePoint admin rights to give me the ability to migrate the data with a third-party tool. I need to work on an alternative, either export the users OneDrive data to an external drive or export to Company B Azure blob storage, I&#x27;ve never tried this. I will be happy to hear any ideas.?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Accounting received a legitimate email from said third-party stating the invoice is due, then a few days go buy and they receive the exact same email again only this time the from email is off 1 letter, for instance instead of accounts.payable@xyzcompanies.com it&#x27;s accounts.payable[@xyzcompanie.com](mailto:walt.disney@xyzcompanie.com). Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it&#x27;s not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...
 We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there&#x27;s not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. 
 Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We&#x27;ve seized everyone&#x27;s laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it&#x27;s on the vendors end but even if it is I don&#x27;t think you can really hold them responsible
 I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it&#x27;s been weeks since it went through. They didn&#x27;t even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. 
 Said vendor also isn&#x27;t a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company. Crazy someone can register a domain 1 letter off.

                              <span>Hey all,
 My supervisor is leaving. He was in a managerial role and did all the paperwork and reports and meetings. He covered me when I took trips, and was my backup when I needed to bounce ideas or troubleshooting around.
 I, the net and sys admin, do 95% of all IT related tasks, and we lost our low level techs over a year ago, but we positioned in a manor where I can pretty much run the place alone. It&#x27;s not a lot of work.
 Their isn&#x27;t enough work for two techs of my skill level IMHO, and the management stuff is signaling that the IT reports, etc of the managerial role can be scaled down. 
 So, idk what to recommend to the business, and quite frankly I&#x27;m stressed out. Can I run the place myself? Sure. Do I want to do that and never get a free thought to go on vacations unbothered, etc. No. But there isn&#x27;t enough work for two techs. If I brought someone else on we would be twirling our thumbs and it would turn into a revolving door of techs I&#x27;m sure.
 What do I do here? Is an MSP an option? Do they help with windows servers, help desk, and Linux servers? I have zero experience dealing with them.
 Do I hire abother tech and we just shoot the shit most of the day? I&#x27;m beyond stressed over this, and considered polishing my resume myself but the company really needs me and I really like the people who run it, it would be hard for me to do that to them.

                              <span>I have had port exhaustion issues for many months now and finally drilled the issue down to Easus Partition Master&#x27;s updater service.
 ​
 Process explorer showed dozens of connections to china being made by this service. After removing it, I have fixed my port exhaustion issues.
 ​
 I have used Partition Master for many years now, but somehow the version released in the range of last year caused port exhaustion.

                              <span>Occasionally we have the need to transfer the contents of a user&#x27;s Onedrive to a location on-prem. Reasons vary, so I won&#x27;t go into all that. I&#x27;m wondering what options others have come up with for this? We have been accessing the user&#x27;s files via the admin center and web interface, but it&#x27;s just so clunky to do it this way when they have a large amount of stuff out there. The MS Sync method has given varying levels of success as well.
 I&#x27;ve seen third party tools that offer Onedrive cloud connectors like Filezilla and such, but they only give you access to the Onedrive of the person logging in. I&#x27;ve seen feature requests for these to add the ability to access the Onedrive&#x27;s of others the admin has access to, but it looks like there is a technical issue to doing this?
 Does a good solution exist for admins to get at the contents of User&#x27;s Onedrives without having to mess with the web interface download?

                              <span>Just needed to get something off my chest after receiving an interesting request today.
 I work for a smaller organization with one main location and a few remote employees scattered around the United States. We rarely have visitors in our main location, so communication with clients is done completely through email and video conferencing. 
 Most of our consultants and executives are well beyond the age of retirement. The only exception is my boss, who is the CTO. We&#x27;ve had this issue where the CEO struggles to handle Teams, Zoom, or Webex calls. Sometimes he unplugs his headset, or mutes himself and thinks his entire computer is broken. 
 It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I&#x27;m called up to his office every time he has a video call to assist him. Naturally, this is becoming extremely disruptiv…</span>

                              <span>Looking through my email I got a recruiter trying to find a &quot;Service Delivery Engineer&quot;.
 Now what the hell would that be? I don&#x27;t know. According to Google- &quot;The role exists to ensure that the company consistently delivers, and the customer consistently receives, excellent service and support.&quot;
 Sounds a lot like customer service rep to me.
 What is up with this trend of calling every role an engineer??? What&#x27;s next the &quot;Service Delivery Architect&quot;? I get that it&#x27;s supposedly used to distinguish expertise levels, but that can be done without calling everything an engineer (jr/sr, level 1,2,3, etc.). It&#x27;s just dumb IMO. Just used to fluff job titles and give people over-inflated opinions of themselves, and also add to the bullshit and obscurity in the job market.
 Edit: Technically, my job title also has &quot;engineer&quot; in it... but alas, I&#x27;m not really an engineer. Configuring and deploying appliances/platforms isn&#x27;t really engineering I don&#x27;t think. One could make the argument that engineer&#x27;s design and build things as the only requirement to be an engineer, but in that case most people would be a very &quot;high level&quot; abstraction of what an engineer used to be, using pre-made tools, or putting pre-constructed &quot;pieces&quot; together... whereas engineers create those tools, or new things out of the &quot;lowest level&quot; raw material/component... ie, concrete/mortar, pcb/transistor, software via your own packages/vanilla code... ya know

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I am currently a Telecommunications technician at a data center and have been working on trying to move my career foreward. I think I am mostly looking for any ideas, tips and tricks, and/or a curriculum on how to best make the move into network engineering or a similar field. I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. 
 I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I&#x27;ve attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am. ( I work 5 days most of the time, 10 hours with 4-5 hours of travel depending on traffic. ) Any and all advice would be welcome. Thank you all so much. 
 TLDR: Telecommunications technician with layer 1 experience looking to move into the Networking field. Looking for thoughts and opinions on how to make the move.

I am guessing someone messed up and added chrome under defender block list? Or there can be something else behind this shitshow
 Imagine 1500 users emailing and calling for chrome, was a complete shitshow

We just went through a printer refresh (switching from buying printers outright to leasing) so I am stuck with these old printers that preceded me when they decided owning the printers was the play. Does anyone have any experience or ideas about selling some large printers? I am talking Kyocera TASKalfa 6053ci with a finisher level of printer.

                              <span>I manage a grumpy 2012DC (DC1) that intermittently freezes and requires a hard reset to resolve. I&#x27;m in the process of attempting to replace it with a new 2019 server (DC2) following this petri.com guideline for DC migration. I stopped just prior to Step 6 &quot;Demote your old domain controller&quot; because I noticed that the SYSVOL and NETLOGON shared didn&#x27;t exist on DC2.
 On DC2 I can view GP objects when I open Group Policy Management, but when I attempt to edit any of them I receive an error &quot;Failed to open Group Policy Object... The system cannot find the path specified.&quot;
 Running dcdiag tests all return &quot;passed test&quot; EXCEPT SystemLog which returns, &quot;EventID: 0x00000422
 The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows attempted to read the file \\CIL.local\sysvol\CIL.local\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\gpt.ini from a domain controller and was not successful. Group Policy settings may not be applied until this event is resolved.&quot; 
 Can anyone out there provide some guidance on how to troubleshoot this? Much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a solo sysadmin for roughly 60 users across two sites and I am in the process of migrating all workstations from MacOS to Windows. Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can&#x27;t just be switched over.
 Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:
  
Because the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? 
 
Some of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? 
 
Due to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?
 
 I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.

 I have 2 long ongoing cases that are not going in the direction i would like them to go so therefore i ask my question here. 
 Summary: 
 We migrated from Exchange 2010 on premise to Exchange Online. The migration itself went fine, we set up a Hybrid and moved everything over gradually.120+ somewhat mailboxes but than the issue; 250+ GB of Public Folders and around 9000 folders at that time. Everything was moved via Powershell scripts, took some good preparation and some figuring out along the way but in the end everything migrated without issues. Read operations of the Public Folders are fine, but write operations to the Public folders are not great.Outlook hangs from time to time and is not useable in the time it is uploading.The time needed to upload…</span>

 I am at my wits end and in hope for your insight.
 I have a WinServer 2019 production server hosting an ERP software. Sometime last week printers stopped working in the software and it appears to be a general printer issue at this server as I cannot manage printers with Windows at all anymore. My biggest issue is, apparantly I am not able to remove/add printers and I cannot find a solution, which has me eyeing registry now for manual removal. sfcscan had no errors, I am not aware of any other repairtools for printerspooler. Driver removal is not possible, as they are being used by the printers. Since I have no experience concerning printers and registry, maybe you can shed some light on that, if it is even possible or know better possibilities beforehan…</span>

We have the quarantine notification system on and our users receive a daily email with emails that were blocked. They can request that they be released but this is not enough for some users. Every so often I go in and wipe out the whitelist and wait for users to complain again. Typically, if the request comes from high up, we just do it. For lower level users, I am unsure how to proceed. How do yall handle this?

 We have 100 servers protected by Sophos Central.
 We need to enable a weekly scheduled scan for each server.
 Each of the 100 servers needs to start it&#x27;s scheduled scan at a different time.
 Is the only way to do this to create 100 separate policies?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 We are testing conditional access MFA using the following policy: 
 Users: Specific group
 Cloud apps or actions: All cloud apps
 Conditions: All trusted locations (Our HQ)
 Grant: Require authentication strength: Custom strength
 Session: Sign-in frequency 30 days
 Session 2: persistent browser session
 The custom authentication strength is almost everything enabled except FIDO2, cert based auth, temp access pass (multi-use) and all of the single factor auth options. 
 This all works quite well for most of our users in the testgroup. However we do notice some bugs or issues.
 1 user needs to re-authenticate OneDrive every day. Sometimes in the middle of the day after a few hours of active use.
 Another user is seeing pop-ups in windows that the account in use has issues/ is broken.
 We also noticed that this user also needed to re-authenticate his workdevice, even though this is an Azure/ Intune joined device. 
 The question:
 Is there something in the authentication strenghts that we need to enable/ adjust?
 Or
 Are there any known issues with the conditional access grant &#x27;require authentication strength&#x27;? 
 Before the switch to &#x27;require authentication strenght&#x27; we used the origional: &#x27;Require multifactor authentication&#x27; for our MFA tests. This worked fine and as excpected.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello folks!
 Formerly in our company we had like 10 employees before I got here almost 2 years ago. Now we are 4 employees (including me). 
 The situation at the workplace
 I am focusing on everything IT-related. They have set up a domain network with 4 windows machines and one windows 2012 R2 server. The employees login through the domain meaning its dependent on the server to work. 
 - Every employee has access to the other employees computer (except for mine)
 As some of you know Windows Server 2012 R2 is about to reach its end of life and so does the software we run on it. 
 ​
 Suggestions needed
 Why even bother logging in through a domain at all? Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder. Meaning I can just &quot;share&quot; a folder in the network with a smaller, not so hot running but modern computer running windows 10 and just share the folder with the other windows 10 machines. 
 I think the server solution for us is just too much work and pointless in our current situation. Are there any concerns about turning the logins of my employees into local accounts?
 I didnt know who to turn to and reading this reddit has helped and inspired me alot for my workplace and I really hope it fits with what the community is about

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been trying for some time to configure Windows 10/11 to work in kiosk mode while also running Docker service and containers in the background. Here are my considerations so far:
  
Containers in Docker Desktop on Windows 10/11 are user-specific, not system-wide.
 How can I run containers that I started on one account while configuring kiosk mode for another account?
 I generate kiosk configurations using Windows Configuration Designer from the Windows ADK package.
 Microsoft&#x27;s documentation in this area is extensive, but it doesn&#x27;t cover running background services or containers.
 Apart from Docker and containers, I want the kiosk to launch Windows Classic Apps by specifying the path to the executable file, which I have already tested.
 I don&#x27;t want the Docker Desktop window to be accessible to the kiosk user.
  
Any additional recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!

 We plan to give all users some standard software i.e. teams, office, etc... with only a few of them 5 ish who have software specific to their role. What do you think the best way is to handle this whole process, something I can suggest to my manager and implement between us?

                              <span>Hi, I have a customer that uses windows 11 to access an L2TP vpn. The configuration worked up to about 10 days ago, now it does not work anymore. 
 The vpn is configured as split tunnel, so internet traffic stays out of the vpn.
 He connects to his wifi at home, then to the vpn, and after just a few minutes (or even just one minute) his internet connection dies. It seems to be connected but he cannot do anything on the internet and of course inside the vpn too.
 He connects to his wifi hotspot on his phone, same issue
 He connects to his home router via a network cable, everything is fine.
 So it seems that when he uses wifi and the vpn, his wifi somehow dies, traffic just stops.
 I have tried setting up a win11 PC the same way (he&#x27;s VERY remote, so I&#x27;m not going to his home, I must solve this remotely) and my win11 PC has the same problem. 
 Googling &quot;win 11 wifi l2tp vpn not working&quot; or something similar gives no meaningful results, so I&#x27;m here asking if someone else is experiencing this issue.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with investigating the options for on-call alerting software for my company.
 We already use incident.io to manage any incidents themselves, and track metrics and trigger alerts with DataDog, both of which are integrated into our Slack workspace to send messages to a custom channel. But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can&#x27;t wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.
 The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we&#x27;d be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can&#x27;t expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).
 This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we&#x27;re entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn&#x27;t go down if AWS has issues.
 What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just &#x27;good enough&#x27;? Is there anything out there that really focuses on the callout schedule and actually calling people out, rather than all the rest of the management and tooling around that?

There is no domain trust or site to site vpn setup and they are to be kept seperate. However they all have 365 user accounts under the same 365 tenant using same domain.
 So I am wondering if I can setup AD connect at each site to sync user accounts? Does 365 have a limit on AD Connect or restrictions if they are all the same domain? I can&#x27;t see any posts on my exact scenario as all others have some AD domain trust or under 1 forest.

                              <span>Hello guys, 
 I&#x27;m looking for method to wipe SSD and NVMe drives. I was searching quite a long time and found ShredOS which should work with those types of drives. 
 However, when I boot the ShredOS, I cannot see drives there. Only my flash drive which is used for boot. It&#x27;s something with ShredOS or it&#x27;s not supporting SSD, NVMe and M.2? I read few reddit posts and people were saying that it should work.

                              <span>I have an HPE 2040 SAN that I replaced with an HPE 2060 earlier this year, and I was wondering what should I do with it.
 To give more context : I&#x27;m the sole IT in a 100 users company, basically manage everything, but I joined just one year ago and I have no history regarding this, I started as helpdesk and climbed my way so I don&#x27;t exactly know best practices regarding this. 
 My initial idea was to unplug it and store it in a safe place so that I can reuse it if any disaster occurs, but I feel like it&#x27;s a waste of resources. I could for instance make a complete test environment which I currently don&#x27;t have (I only have test machines and systems for very specific things). 
 I may also try to use it as a lab, for instance to test new things (learning a bit more about Proxmox which I think may be enterprise-ready for some time in the future, already use it privately and would like to try on on high-end machines).
 Same thing happened with my previous ESX hosts, I basically unplugged them and stored them even though they are still perfectly functionning. I budgeted their replacement and didn&#x27;t have enough rack space to keep them on, so I stored them safely. 
 Anyone care to give me general advices on what to do with them ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Seeking the hive mind as i&#x27;ve exhausted most other options here.
 A users Excel always hangs for 5 - 10 seconds when closing, the file can be on OneDrive (Local), Network Share or even a blank workbook. It sounds pretty trivial but its actually very frustrating to work with.
 This is a new Windows 11 machine (4 months old), it&#x27;s a pretty well spec&#x27;d workstation for office use.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when starting excel in Safe Mode. 
 - The behaviour is repeatable with no Add Ins enabled.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when using another user account on the PC (domain joined). 
 - Office is the latest version.
 - Tried many small online fixes (Disabling hardware acceleration etc etc).
 What else does Safe Mode disable that might be causing Excel to hang like this?
 I&#x27;ve yet to do a fresh install of office as i feel it probably wont make any difference.
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey fellow Redditors,
 I recently made the tough decision to quit my first job as a sysadmin, and I&#x27;m seeking some advice to validate whether it was the right move or not. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I want to provide all the necessary details.
 I started this job about two months ago, excited to kickstart my career as a sysadmin, after 2 years stuck in the helpdesk. However, things haven&#x27;t gone as planned. My primary responsibility was to develop and roll out our CRM system, which initially seemed like a fantastic opportunity for me to learn and grow. Unfortunately, the project got stuck due to platform issues, and no one seemed proactive in resolving them or assigning me other meaningful tasks.
 A few weeks ago, I approached my manager to express my concerns about th…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 Over the weekend I pushed out a group policy to define the &quot;Log on as a service&quot; permission to some service accounts. This cleared out the settings on an application server that had this value defined manually by gpedit.msc
 I was under the assumption that my policy would have added my accounts in addition to any preexisting ones but I was obviously wrong.
 My issue is, I have other domains to roll this setting out to with applications I&#x27;m not fully aware of.
 Is there a way for me to query servers in my domains to find any servers that have this setting defined manually in gpedit as rsop.msc doesnt show the manually defined ones.

                              <span>I recently set up a new file server, removed the partition that contained all the shares from the old one and added it to new FS. I removed the old FS from our and removed the deactivated computer object. Then I changed the IP.and the host name of the new one to the same as the old and everything seemed fine.
 Now exactly 30 days after changing the host name the trust relationship between the AD and the new FS failed. I logged in as a local admin and reset the computer password using PS and everything worked again.
 How do you guys do it? How long do you wait to change host names after a migration? Did you experience something like that and will.it happen again after the next 30 days? Should I remove the machine from the AD completely and rejoin it anew if it happens again?

 At the moment I have about 500 laptops that are fully Azure AD joined and managed from Intune. In two months 500 new laptops will be ordered that I would like to use as a hybrid. So then they are Hybrid Azure AD joined with MDM Microsoft Configuration Manager/Intune.
 The new laptops come with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed.
 Normally I install all new equipment via Microsoft Configuration Manager which includes an local AD join step. The machine then enters Azure via Azure Active Directory sync. The machine then enters Intune via Cloud attach in Microsoft Configuration Manager.
 What is your method of getting machines with a pre-installed (Pro or higher) OS hybrid?

                              <span>Our organization is currently exploring the implementation of Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) to improve remote access for our employees. However, we have a mixed setup, with some resources hosted in the cloud (such as O365 and various Web SaaS apps) and others hosted on-premises.
 To provide some context, we currently utilize Azure AD with Business Premium License P2 for our authentication and access management. We have also adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, allowing employees to use their personal devices to access organizational resources.
 However, due to compliance requirements, employees are only allowed to access O365 applications if their device is registered with Intune and Conditional Access policies are applied.
 How can SASE help address our specific needs and challenges in this mixed setup? We are aware that SASE combines network and security capabilities into a unified cloud-based solution, but we are uncertain about its applicability to our situation.

 2 hyper visors with storage with S2D in a failovercluster. 
 Now we are going to buy new storage SAN (alletra) 
 Is it possible to use both our old hp servers for the same storage, but then only the computing power (ram /cpu), or is it only possible to use 1? We can run with only 1 but 2 would be better. 
 (main reason is load balancing. can i like setup 30 vm&#x27;s and set that the first 15 use the cpu of hyper visor 1 and the second one the other 15?

 20 y/o IT admin here. I fucked up bad today, just to give some context my company is acquiring another business and will be managing them. Technically the ownership is not until a few days. Currently there is the existing ISP modem the business uses and then there was one installed recently that is ours. There is an edge router thats also existing and we just went ahead and shipped off a meraki MX95 that we will be using with our ISP. 
 A ticket was assigned over to me to work with a third-party technician to install the MX95 and get WAN connectivity up and running (VLANs and DHCP IP scopes were pre-configured) The ticket was made by our PM and was relatively vague. 
 It was titled router deployment and the notes just i…</span>

                              <span>We’re considering getting a second drop from our colocation provider for full redundancy. We currently have a couple pfSense boxes in HA alongside a couple customer firewalls so we do have an L2 switch sitting between our drop and all firewalls.
 What’s the best route to go with if we go with a redundant drop? 2 separate L2 switches? 2 stacked switches with STP? Connect each pfSense box to each drop then passthrough whichever public ips to the customer firewalls? Something else I’m missing?
 I don’t always reply to every comment so thanks in advance!

 ​
 NaaS sounds like a threat career, but I&#x27;m wondering how others feel.
 Does anyone with first hand experience either at the consumer of NaaS or the vendor mind sharing? 
 Is there still a role for a network engineer at a company that consumes NaaS? And if so, what does that look like?

 Does anyone know if ethernet-to-fiber converters can be used with plain old telephone service? Obviously, there are physical differences between RJ-11 and RJ-45.
 I purchased Primeda-tronic 2 Ports RJ11 Telephone and 10/100Mbps Ethernet Over Fiber Converters that worked for a few months, but I believe one of the converters has given up the ghost.
 Any information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I was told I should look into using a DAC instead of an SFP to RJ45 transceiver. So far I am unable to find a DAC that works for HP, and that works for SFP 1G, everything seems be for SFP+ 10G which i&#x27;m reading is not compatible. Does anyone have any recommendations?

                              <span>I was curious if anyone knows the answer to this question. When connected to a Loadmaster and looking at the statistics, I am trying to understand what the Total Conns means. Is that just a connection for an individual service, port, user connection, etc? It is a total connection over 24 hours? The ask is because I do not know why some of my numbers are so high, when the system is a test system and not heavily utilized by more than a few people, however the total connections is over 2000.
 Seems Kemp questions are pretty vague here in this sub, but I am hoping for the best. If I should post this in another sub I can do so. Thank you in advance for any help.

                              <span>Hello Big Reddit Brain. I’m studying for CCNP and working through HSRP. Pretty easy to understand, but I’m stuck on one concept and the class materials are not explaining. So, the Physical Active Router handles ALL of the traffic, including ARP requests, which are first sent to whatever router the host is connected to. What if a host is physically connected (through the topology that might include some switches) to the router acting as Standby? The book/class doesn’t mention it, but is there a requirement that there be redundant L2 paths for hosts so they can potentially reach ALL routers participating in HSRP?

                              <span>Had an incident where a weird dormant Cisco device bug affecting a few versions reared it&#x27;s ugly head after we made a change which caused at least 1 production device to begin repeatedly reloading.
 I kind of want to take on a side project to leverage some Cisco API to identify potential bugs related to upcoming changes across a large array of platforms and IOS/NX/XR versions. So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I&#x27;ll be using Python, but language/nuances don&#x27;t matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api&#x27;s they&#x27;ve leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.
 Thanks for any info!

 Hello there! As mentioned in the title, we require a program with the same functionality as TCP Test Tool by SimpleCom Tools. 
 So far, I have been unable to find another program, and the one by SimpleCom needs .NET Framework 3.5, and installing/enabling it is not an option. 
 Does anybody know of a similar program or if there is a newer version of it? (The one I found was v.3.0).
 Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!

                              <span>My apologies in advance if this is the wrong area for this kind of problem or if it&#x27;s too simple.
 I&#x27;m an old dinosaur who used to set up office VPNs about 15 or 20 years ago. These were simple VPNs which allowed remote users to access their documents at their office.
 The method back then was to set up a vpn connector on the laptop, point it to the public IP, and set up forwarding for a couple of ports in the router. Then IIRC I&#x27;d set up permissions in their account on the server.
 I&#x27;ve been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.
 Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.
 Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I&#x27;ve gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I&#x27;m so hopelessly out of the loop that I don&#x27;t even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs. If anyone can steer this old coot in the right direction I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. Again, I apologize of this question is not appropriate for this group.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to apply Voice, Video, and some critical data QoS to out network. I&#x27;ve done the research on how to create a class-map, policy-map, and how to apply the policy-map to the interface. However, when I try to apply the policy-map, it is getting rejected with error message:
 &quot;Invalid queuing class-map!!! Queuing actions supported only with dscp/cos/qos-group/precedence/exp based classification!!!&quot;
 I&#x27;ve tried using both dscp and cos just as the message is saying, but the policy-map won&#x27;t get applied to the interface.
 class-map match-any VIDEO
 match protocol rtp video
 match cos 5
 class-map match-any VOICE
 match protocol rtp audio
 match ip dscp default
 policy-map QOS-POLICY
 class VOICE
 priority level 1 percent 25
 class VIDEO
 priority level 2 percent 25
 This is the class-map and policy map that is currently configured. Our switch is Cisco Catalyst 9500-40x. Is there switches that can&#x27;t accept certain QoS configurations? I&#x27;ve read that the interface supports certain QoS traffic and this is the result of the interface i&#x27;m trying too apply this to:
 TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 Model: C9500-40X
 Type: SFP-10GBase-LR
 Speed: 10000
 Duplex: full
 Trunk encap. type: 802.1Q
 Trunk mode: on,off,desirable,nonegotiate
 Channel: yes
 Broadcast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Unicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Multicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Flowcontrol: rx-(off,on,desired),tx-(none)
 Fast Start: yes
 QoS scheduling: rx-(not configurable on per port basis),
 tx-(2p6q3t)
 CoS rewrite: yes
 ToS rewrite: yes
 UDLD: yes
 Inline power: no
 SPAN: source/destination
 PortSecure: yes
 Dot1x: yes
 Breakout Support: not applicable
 Is the interface compatible for the QoS?

 I&#x27;m trying to find a configuration which will allow me to use IPv6 prefixes from multiple ISPs. I&#x27;ve tried configuring multiple prefix delegations on the gateway router, and the end-devices receive IPv6 addresses from both ISPs, but the traffic ends up being black-holed (I&#x27;d love to know why, if anyone can tell me).
 My current gateway is an Edgerouter 12, but hardware isn&#x27;t a blocker if I need something more advanced. I have familiarity with PFSense, Cisco and a bit with some other vendors.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Going through our switches that were recently configured and I am coming across some some inconsistancies with the vty lines. Some are like this....
 line vty 0 2, line vty 3 4, line vty 5 31 
 Then others will be 
 line vty 0 4, line vty 5 98 
 And some other ones too with random numbers.
 Is there an easy way to reconfigure these so that every switch is the same? I know the commands to do so, but Will I lose ssh connection and have an unreachable switch if I delete all the vty lines and then configure new ones?
 I need to change the session timeouts on all the switches and its tough to push a config change out when all the vty lines are different.

                              <span>Hi, has anyone had any experience with getting DHCP snooping working on Dell OS10?
 I have a pair of S5232F-ON running OS10 10.5.5.3 configured as a VLT pair.
 The manual is pretty vague on DHCP snooping - it says all you have to do is configure &quot;ip dhcp snooping trust&quot; on the uplink that faces the DHCP server, and then enable &quot;ip dhcp snooping&quot; globally. I&#x27;ve tried this, and as soon as I turn on DHCP snooping globally, attached systems can&#x27;t get DHCP any more. As soon as I turn off snooping, DHCP works again.
 Support say that as no bugs have been reported with DHCP snooping, it must be that I&#x27;ve misconfigured the switch. This is entirely possible but not very helpful!
 If anyone knows how to make it work for sure, I&#x27;d be very interested.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Background: I&#x27;m running Proxmox with one physical interface, eno1, and two virtual interfaces, vmbr0 and vmbr1. vmbr0 is bridged to eno1 for a few VMs/containers to sit directly on my LAN. vmbr1 is a private Proxmox LAN and is NAT&#x27;d through vmbr0 to access the internet. I have a web server on 10.1.0.5:443 and have a DNAT rule in iptables to achieve port forwarding:
 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.1.0.5:443 
 The problem is that when traffic comes in from the bridged devices, this rule ends up applying since it&#x27;s coming in on vmbr0 and then getting forwarded out. How I can make this rule apply only to packets that originally come from eno1 or distinguish it in some other way? I&#x27;d prefer not to just put exceptions for each individual bridged IP. I&#x27;m still pretty new to iptables so any help or clarification for any misunderstandings I may be having is very appreciated.

                              <span>I have pretty stringent SLAs with my customer so I am looking at getting extra Internet insurance. 
 I have two DIA circuits to two diverse providers, diverse entry points into the building and diverse paths all the way to the providers POPs. I am doing BGP to each and advertising out a /24 so I feel pretty confident in the resiliency of this design but I am really adverse to taking a SLA hit. 
 I am curious if I was to add two cradle points and BGP peer with the cell providers and advertise out the /24 as a third and fourth backup option is even possible and if anyone has done this.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I am working on this old network infrastucture and I am trying to replace some 3Com 4500 with Ruckus ICX 7150-48P. While doing some tests I found out that if I connect this two models of switches together with a patch cord everything works fine, but if I try to use a fiber link, the status led one the port lights up only on one switch, the 3Com.
 I have tried every possible combination of SFP module, tried to configure the ports in many ways but nothing seems to work.
 I wanna ask if in your opinin it is possible that these switches are just not compatible because I have tried replacing both switches, one at the time, with various ones and always worked except in this one condidion.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I am currently examining the DDI market and would like to know about the existing standards and trends. Specifically, I am interested in cloud-based solutions or cloud-managed options available.Currently, our organization lacks an IPAM system, and DHCP and DNS functions are handled by the AD DCs. In addition to Infoblox, BlueCat, and EfficientIP, I am curious to know about other notable players in the market. (I would like to avoid Infoblox due to its high cost.)
 I am not looking for an overlay solution to manage DNS and DHCP on the AD DCs. Rather, I am interested in a separate solution that can remove the DNS and DHCP roles from the AD DCs entirely.
 Objective is to streamline infrastructure by separating the DHCP and DNS responsibilities from the AD DCs and consolidating them within a comprehensive DDI solution. Solution will be internal only, no public facing DNS, split-horizon, etc..
 EDIT: Looking for enterprise solution with vendor support, no DIY with Netbox and BIND/KEA

I currently have a Google domain and use Wix for the website, I emailed them to see if they could help this is what they said 
 &quot;I have noticed that not only SPF and DKIM, but DMARC record has been added to your domain&#x27;s settings as well. Kindly note that Wix does not support DMARC records. There is a lot of overlap in the function of DMARC &amp; DKIM, and the use of DKIM+SPF is more effective. Thus, kindly remove the DMARC record from the TXT section&quot; so I&#x27;ve removed the DMARC record right now. Can anyone help me make sense of this? What exactly does this mean and how will this affect my business domain email deliverability?

 It&#x27;s starting to take its&#x27; toll and I&#x27;m becoming a very doom-scrolly about it all because I&#x27;m quickly discovering there&#x27;s more information out there (most of it painted in a negative light) than any human being could ever process to keep their sanity. 
 So how do you guys find that balance between work/education for retaining your work and living off-line? 
 The internet seems more like a prison every day.

 It&#x27;s all being rejected by Mimecast ESG for reasons like &quot;IP found in RBL&quot; - which is great. But... why us, why now, and are other org&#x27;s seeing the same?
 Mimecast Support are not telling me if other client tenancies are seeing the same increase.
 Here&#x27;s some stats:
  
17/04/23 Mimecast Account Assessment for the week report shows 18,984 total rejections with 11,963 as IP in RBL for the week. I&#x27;m adding this in here because this is an average week, and has been for over 18-months.

                              <span>I need some advice....
 I have 2TB of data on a windows server ec2 instance, just over half a million files and folders (not evenly distributed) some are gzipped, some are plain text, video etc. All of it is really important and I need to move it as fast as possible to a host outside of amazon. 
 Can someone recommend some software to do this? I&#x27;ve been trying to backup to s3 using some backup software but the transfer speeds tank after the first 200GB or so has been transferred. Goes from 1gbps down to 50mbps....
 I&#x27;m not hitting bandwidth limits or anything. Its something between that software and s3. The instance and bucket are in the same region. I also tried using network drives from the destination host but something is off with the transfer to the host from aws, getting 2mbps max (using robocopy)
 Need help :(

                              <span>Our company is in the process of rolling out MS Teams to the organization. The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. 
 Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. 
 So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. 
 I did some searching but couldn&#x27;t find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.
 So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought. 
 Cheers

                              <span>I was working in a small company, being the sole IT guy doing everything from setting up firewalls and servers, to troubleshooting printers. 2 months ago I had a pretty big fuck up, and last week I was told they finally found my replacement.
 As much as this sucks, the place was pretty toxic and once I find a new job I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be much happier. My question is, how do I handle the question of why I&#x27;m looking for employment? I feel like telling a prospective employer that the job had a very negative impact on my mental health to the point that I started to make mistakes is probably not the best move.
 I&#x27;ve never been in a situation like this, so I would love to hear any advice. I actually have a phone interview later this week, but still shell shocked over the whole situation, and I&#x27;m not sure how to even talk about my current employment status.

                              <span>I always see US salaries upwards of $100k posted here and I’m wondering what it varies like in the UK? 
 I could probably be classed as a junior admin at the moment but if I put the work in it’d be interesting to know what I could realistically be making.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am working on AD/Group Policy cleanup and organization and I&#x27;ve come across a few GPOs that are extended to our child domains.
 This is a bit new to me since the last two environments I worked out of did not follow this practice and would re-create the same GPO for each child domain.
 IE, If the parent root domain has a GPO for specific server configurations, that same GPO is re-created in each domain within the forest. A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.
 Now, I&#x27;m working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it&#x27;s ideal. I can&#x27;t recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can&#x27;t narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it&#x27;s a normal thing to do.
 AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices
 Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I&#x27;m assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?
 I&#x27;m more curious about the performance impact.
 On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\child.domain\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?
 While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\policies folder, I find it obviously. 
 ​
 Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m just wondering how you all do it out there.
 On the one hand the company data is secured by wiping it but on the other hand you just gave the thief a usable laptop.
 I guess its not that hard to swap a harddrive, so we wipe them.

                              <span>In our environment we have an application which runs via SSH. The windows clients received via Intune Putty and a shortcut pointing to Putty containing the IP address for the connection. Now we might have to update the IP address in that shortcut, so the plan would be to deploy a superseding app (the shortcut is deployed via script as a win32 app), but this of course will take some time, and I was thinking if there&#x27;s a way to improve this kind of update. This time we can&#x27;t just move the old server ip address to the new one as it will be still needed on the old one. What would be a good solution to connect all the clients to the new server without intervening on the clients?

 What else may be the problem?

 I installed Alma Linux on VPS, then I update it, then I installed CyberPanel with OpenLiteSpeed and now I’ve created a fresh site in public_html I only have the basic index.html file.
 When I write the server’s IP in the browser, I get the 404 error from OpenLiteSpeed. I even tried to open it as a IP/index.html but still I got the 404 error.
 I checked the permisions for both the public html (drwxr-x—) and index.html (-rw-rw-r–) and they are just like in the shared hosting with cPanel that I want migrate to the VPS.
 As I said, this is a fresh install and didn’t change anything and simply I don’t understand why I can’t access the index.html file.
 Please help me!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently delivering free training on the full CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 20 modules and I will creating a dedicated video for each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since each video covers a whole module after all.
 I add time stamps in each video for you convenience if your only looking for something specific in a module or only want to refresh on a certain topic so please feel free to make use of them.
 There will be 22 videos for this course, the first is just the 6 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules with the actual course.
 The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+ and the other courses I deliver sho…</span>

                              <span>So I make mid 150k with bonus incl. zero college. No certs. Im recently got promoted as an IT Dir and I feel I am overpaid. I’ve worked my ass off and I was content making 100k usd. I am the sys admin for literally all systems and I have one tech that helps me but I do all the heavy lifting. I’m on call 24/7 but I’ve managed to keep the system stable to the point I barely feel I’m on call. My boss is amazing. Understands very well the time/life balance thing. I’m also afraid that the new 150k is the old 100kusd given inflation. Can’t help but think I am still being overpaid. It scares me because I know finding another job at the same pay rate will be difficult. I’ve done my best to keep my life style comfortable making less money and putting away. I suffer from ADHD and anxiety. And it’s driving me crazy. I’m a making too too much of it? )no pun intended)

                              <span>We need to do reset this pc on about 1000 machines, we worked out a way to trigger it via SCCM on demand so users can do it when is suitable for them. Part way through deployment we discovered a number of machines have a faulty/missing winre.wim and would just reboot strait into the troubleshoot menu. After replacing the .wim file we get part way through the reset process but it then fails, there&#x27;s a number of config errors in the $sysreset logs that I&#x27;m trying to identify the core issue from
 The strange part is when we copy the Hardrive and boot it up in a VM in hyper-v it says fixing C for a bit (3 stages) and then when doing the reset it works strait away. 
 Any idea what the fix hyper-v would be doing on first attaching a disk to a VM?

                              <span>Hey,
 I have multiple client users who have developed problems with network drives (DFS shares). The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it&#x27;s extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the &quot;Not Responding&quot; state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.
 What I&#x27;ve checked and done:
  
Checked that network speeds are fine -&gt; Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.
 
Checked that system uptime is not crazy high.
 
SFC and DISM returned no issues.
 
Cleared Explorer cache
 
Made explorer run each window as a separate process.
 
All Windows updates are installed.
 
All &quot;Lenovo System Updates&quot; are installed.
 
Unmapped all drives and remapped them again.
 
Made sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.
 
 The only thing that I&#x27;ve found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer&#x27;s slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn&#x27;t going to be done soon).
 At this point I&#x27;m kinda out of ideas, can&#x27;t even find anything to try. Does anyone know any fixes for this?

 Thank you guys :):):)

 ---------------------
 Hello guys, i have an msi package and i need to install it on specific group of computers, so, i created a security group called computersGroup1 and added the computers i need to apply gpo on, and followed the below article here
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/190901/apply-gpo-only-to-one-computer
 but when trying gpoupdate /force it says completed succsefully but no software is installed, and using gpresult /r doesn&#x27;t show my gpo.
 the msi package is located in user configuration so it can be installed at startup

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve recently landed my first sysadmin job and while I&#x27;m super excited about this opportunity, I must admit that I&#x27;m still very green when it comes to sysadmin skills.
 Since I have a considerable commute to work, I thought it would be the perfect time to dive into some books or handbooks to download on my ebook that could help me level up my knowledge in this field.
 Whether it&#x27;s a comprehensive guide to Window/Linux administration, network management, or security best practices, I&#x27;m open to any suggestions that can help me become a more competent sysadmin.
 I&#x27;m looking for resources that are beginner-friendly, providing clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. It would be great if the books cater to both Windows and Linux environments since I&#x27;ll end up working with both at some stage of my career.
 Additionally, I&#x27;m interested in hearing about any online resources, blogs, or podcasts that have been helpful to you in your sysadmin journey. Any supplemental learning materials that can be consumed during my commute would be fantastic!
 TIA

                              <span>Hi,
 I am looking for a tool to keep an inventory of computers complete with their components and ideally also with the software installed on them. Preferably a cloud solution to keep everything online.
 At this moment I found 2 good options but maybe you have something else to recommend.
 1 Option is Snipe IT (https://snipeitapp.com/)
 But that&#x27;s only for inventory. I have to add computer specs manually.
 2 Option is PC Doctor Toolbox Remote (https://www.pc-doctor.com/solutions/toolbox)
 There I can add computers to an account and have everything I need at once but not as a list. I am not sure about this solution, won&#x27;t it consume too much computer resources when transferring everything live?
 Thanks for your answers

 Server error: &#x27;451 Requested action aborted: local error in processing&#x27;
 they are claiming there IT have said we have blacklisted them, which we haven&#x27;t.
 ​
 I have only ever come across this once before but it was when dealing with someone hosted by IONOS. We use 365, and the client say they do as well. 
 Anyone any experience with his issue?

                              <span>My apologies if this is not the right sub to post in but... I scored an interview for a L1 Helpdesk role after months of trying to get my foot through the IT door. This will be a group interview, which is not something I was expecting at all. Is this common for helpdesk positions?
 Feeling super nervous, so I&#x27;d appreciate any tips/ advice :&#x27;)
 Edit to add extra info: The interview will be held online, and the invitation mentioned &quot; splitting you into groups&quot; which makes me think that it might be a group interview where multiple candidates will be present.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having an issue with a Windows Server 2019 VM.
 The environment:
  
Single Host VMware ESXi 6.7.0 build17499825
 4 VM Windows Server 2019
  
Only one of the four VMs started to crash, no changes were made to the VM.
 This VM has some administrative software that is used by end users.
 What is happening:
  
VM works, I can connect through RDP
 Rdp connection closes unexpectedly
 From VMware console, I can see the VM is still on but in the Sign-in screen the network icon has a big red X on it.
 When I try to enter credentials, it just keeps loading forever
 When I reboot the VM, it loads until I see the Windows logo and then it restarts automatically
 After three times it goes in recovery mode
 Tried all usual stuff from a mounted Windows Server ISO (chkdsk, sfc scannow, dism, rebuild bcd... nothing works)
 I restored the VM from backups and then I took a snapshot from VMware
 The issue is that I can&#x27;t check Windows logs to find out what happens during the crash as the VM becomes unresponsive. I can only revert to the snapshot.
 When I revert to the snapshot I can work inside the VM until the crash happens again.
 It seems that before the crash there are no error logs in the Event Viewer.
 I think it could be the software installed inside this VM that triggers the crash but I cannot get proof.
  
EDIT
  
I created a local user joined to local admin group
 I was able to log in after the network crash
 I can see that under Control Panel there are no network cards, it does not matter how many network cards I add from VMware ESXi
 It seems like a driver issue, in Device Management I see a lot of unknown devices with warnings 
  
Any ideas?
 Thank you

 I have added the address to the anti-spam inbound policy that we have but we keep getting the same emails from the same address.
 Are there any other steps that can be taken in situations like this?

 ​
 We have a labcomputer that just died so i want to open it upp to check what the issue can be. 
 ​
 This computer is OLD and i have never seen one that has no screws and no buttons to open the chassi before. I have tried with just force to open it by dragging the side panels but they do not budge at all. Any ideas? 
 ​
 Here is a picture on the chassi
 Near the blue markings ive made there is just a hole, its not a button to press.

 Now i dont know if this is a possible thing im still new to Windows Server, but assuming it is
 We get lots of password reset requests from our users and i&#x27;ve seen that senior system admins have said this is not a priority it can be attended to in 4 hours they are not in a hurry
 but to me it&#x27;s just a few clicks and the user is back on their workstation in no time it doesn&#x27;t take time
 So i&#x27;ve been thinking why not give users the ability to reset their own domain passwords just like google, facebook etc allows us? it should spare us time to work on other things and gets the user back to production in little time

                              <span>So I have been on the hunt for a new job and one of the places I check regularly is my countries Job Bank. 
 I see a lot of &quot;seemingly&quot; good positions with decent wages.
 But recently a ton of them have for applications to send it to a email....nearly all of which have a generic domain, be it Outlook, Gmail, even a few old Hotmails in there.
 ​
 The consensus I get from others in the field is that if a company is too cheap to have its own domain, then there IT budget is likely a mess.
 But I am curious how cheap they are .
 Tried googling domain costs and I get different answers, some saying .net domains are like $3-5 Canadian to buy, others say .com are $15-20 Canadian to buy with another 20 or annually.
 Others say its $500 dollars.
 I get estimates all over the map, just curious what is a standard domain name initial buy and the annual fees and see how cheap a lot of these companies recruiting are.

                              <span>Good evening r/networking,
 We are looking at the possibility of jumping from one WLAN MSP who has been with us for a very long time to another, newer one. The older one has provided a decent quality of service but has been very expensive with respect to WLAN/LAN costs for clients in the building. The building I work at is a very large campus (over 700k sqr ft), and I am not in a position of leadership, but I&#x27;m being dragged along for observational purposes, opinions, etc. My supervisor is a finance person, and I am the only in-house IT Manager/Network Engineer person on site for these systems. I would love to bring it in-house and build out a department, as I feel it is silly to jump from one MSP, gut out all that past experience and knowledge of the building/know-how on dealing with clients, and going to a new one. I&#x27;ve been reading non-stop about design and management, but I was wondering if people had any advice on how to approach this, resources I should read up on, questions I should ask, etc. I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;m nervous about this whole ordeal. Thank you.

 I&#x27;ve never done this, and my first configuration is to switch a WatchGuard to a Fortinet and the configuration files for both are...in wildly different formats.
 For future use, what&#x27;s the best way to configure them? What info should I be forthcoming wtih in terms of using? Capturing rules/tunnels first? Blocking ports?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m pursuing a networking career and currently working as a field support technician (my job mostly involves tackling escalations, configuring/installing network devices and occasional server hardware installation or troubleshooting).
 I acquired my CCNA last year and I learned heaps from this certification.
 I really enjoy networking and would like to work toward getting the CCNP in the future. I understand there is a core exam (ENCOR) which needs to be passed before undertaking a concentration exam. I have very basic scripting knowledge but like idea of network automation and hoping to spark serious interest to this area.
 I may not know enough to properly make a decision on which specialty field to take for the concentration exam, but hypothetically speaking, if I were to choose the DevNet Professional for the concentration exam, would it make more sense for me to take the DEVASC exam rather than ENCOR?
 I would likely enjoy studying for the ENCOR exam since the topics appear very important to know and interesting but because I want to strengthen network programming, the DEVASC exam look nice as well.
 Btw I’m not in a rush to get CCNP certified, it’s something I would like to study slowly in addition to working full-time.
 Open to everyone’s opinion and advice!

                              <span>Quick background, prior military. Worked on a Enterprise network for close to 6 years and I realized I love everything network related and Linux. I was fairly confident in my skills, being a mix of a sys admin/network admin. 
 I understood what I was reading, how to implement changes, why are some areas are wrong, and so forth. I felt I was mid to senior level based on situations I resolved and people around me congratulating me.
 Then I start doing interviews and I couldn&#x27;t really answer most if not all network questions. It was a eye opener and I believe it was because everything I learned was self taught, (googling, help command, reading past sailors notes, and good old trial and error). 
 My current gig title is a system/Network admin where I do software installs for ships and make sure no problems arise during the process. Not a lot of network problems pop up. I want to be a cloud network engineer in the next 5 years, so what is the best way to validate/better my skills as a network engineer in you guy&#x27;s opinions?

 I was at BT for about 1 1/2 years give or take, and in that our team set up a complex RTE and I was tasked with the networking components such as setting up Juniper Spine and leafs, PA FWLs, NSX-T and AVI ALBs.
 Now I will be moving to a new role, but I always like to have a goal or pathway to my next stage in my career, I plan to stay at CGI learning and absorbing all I can for at-least 5ish years.
 I have no formal certs in Networking, but my eventual goal is to set up a business but I’m not very familiar with that and what kind of services a networking business could provide, does anyone here have any good advice on what things I could offer/provide and some advice on a pathway to get there? 
 Thank you for all your time!

 I&#x27;m looking for something that is easy to use, free, and reliable. Additionally, it would be great if it supports UEFI.

                              <span>Hello All,
 This might not be a good fit for this subreddit, but I&#x27;m curious whether any of you have heard of a Microsoft&#x27;s recent offerings to protect the data stored within SQL Server databases, &#x27;Transparent data encryption&#x27; (TDE) and &#x27;Dynamic data masking&#x27; (DDM).
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view&#x3D;sql-server-ver16
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking?view&#x3D;sql-server-ver16
 My place of employment is investigating whether one of these methods might be useful to protect the data within some of our systems. 
 I&#x27;m not a DBA, I&#x27;m in an app support space, but I&#x27;m about to seek our vendor responses to either of these methods. As far as I can tell, with either method of encryption, the app is none the wiser, it&#x27;s completely ignorant of the protection of the data in the same way that Windows apps are completely ignorant of the presence of BitLocker encrypting a HDD.
 As I say, this might not be applicable to this subreddit, but I&#x27;d love to know of anyone familiar with these technologies and if so, any gotchyas or caveats or horror stories.
 Cheers!

                              <span>What tools do you use for discovery on an infrastructure that has close to 0 documentation?
 For everything network related I usually go for nmap, but I don&#x27;t know where to look when it comes to Windows, I often end up looking at procmon but I look for something more polished that isn&#x27;t as overhelming
 Thanks in advance and have a good day!

                              <span>Strange situation, though maybe not all that uncommon. I inherited an environment where previous admin had configured an Enterprise CA. We are in the process of removing all the servers from one of our locations and this CA is there. In the past, it seems this were used by local web apps for our organization. However, we have moved towards using another CA in another AD forest for our web apps as we are obligated to use the new CA in another forest. The only certificates that are currently active, non expired, and issued are our domain controllers. 
 Can i go through the decommissioning and not transferring certificates to other AD Forest CA without disruption (i have no access to other CA)? Will this adversely affect our domain controllers? It seems like the domain controller certificates are elements to a Windows environment implementation and would not impact Windows Domain services, etc if I decomissioned properly.

                              <span>My story begins 2 years ago when I was a (small) server room operator with 24h shifts alterating with 3 guys. I wanted to step up the ladder since there was a single sysadmin (owner) for everything. So I started getting server/VPS upgrade requests from clients. However, I literally had a breakdown by the second or third occasion. I was just stalling the task for over a MONTH, literally dreading the task for 24/7. I literally came out of that experience completely broken.
 At this moment, after such a long time, I realised that it was the fucking &quot;trying to hammer at a pillar while standing on it&quot; nature that flipped me the fuck up. Of course I was out of my mind having to do some shit I dont understand and being an idiot for not having a proper backup. Naturally, I did not even ask a fucki…</span>

                              <span>I guess I just can&#x27;t figure this working thing out. In my mind I eventually land at nimble, medium-sized company free of red tape full of mentors and powerful, popular products with happy customers!
 In real life I&#x27;ve jumped jobs 3 times in 16 months trying to find a company worth being at.
 Legend has it (before my time), most of the old knowledge walked out the door and the owners brought in a bunch of new people. But it&#x27;s the blind leading the blind. Like they are 100 tickets behind in support cases, customers are yelling at the support e-mail boxes every day, features are delayed, and nobody can barely train me to help at all on our software (Service desk is below my role but I&#x27;d do it just because they need it) because hardly anyone knows what&#x27;s going on.
 I am grateful for the job but there&#x27;s also something to be said for being proud of your workplace and, that I am not. Low-key can&#x27;t see how they possibly are surviving much longer.

Ideally they would completely reset on boot, so all user files, etc, would be deleted and some specified software would be &quot;installed&quot;. Is it possible to do this without booting from the network or booting from a restore point every time? If the restore point is the solution, how can I make sure all of the systems load from that on boot every time?

                              <span>Sorry if wrong sub please direct me to the right sub for this question then
 So basically I&#x27;ve been thinking about this and still don&#x27;t quite get it. Take a standard Windows 10 Pro OS for example. If the BIOS isn&#x27;t locked by a password, you just enter it and boot into a USB drive containing a Windows Password Recovery software and bam, you got access to the admin account since now you got the password to it. If the BIOS IS locked with a password, then you take out the CMOS for a minute, put it back in, now the BIOS has been reset and you can enter it again without any password, and now rinse and repeat what I&#x27;ve said earlier. If Bitlocker Pre-boot PIN is enabled, then you can just crack Bitlocker with a software like John The Ripper (but that&#x27;s way more complicated than just using the software itself, there&#x27;s many extra steps to it and it can take hours even, but I&#x27;m not going into that coz that&#x27;d take too much time and space). So Bitlocker doesn&#x27;t protect someone from knowledgeable people like IT forensics (working for the police), a BIOS password also doesn&#x27;t. Windows also includes a lot of telemetry by Microsoft by default, so if you&#x27;re super paranoid, then again it&#x27;s not a good OS.
 I could go on and on about the many different exploits of the Windows OS. Why do companies still use Windows Enterprise as the OS on their workstations (unless we&#x27;re talking servers but here I&#x27;m not; I&#x27;m talking about the workstations employees use, on their company laptops etc)

                              <span>We are a Windows shop with about 4000 endpoints using SCCM. I needed to push out a .exe we received from a vendor (which puts files in the user’s AppData folder) to clients with a silent switch. I created a PS script to copy the .exe to the machine, run install and put a validation file on the C:/folder so SCCM can figure out if it has run or not. If I manually ‘Run Script’ for that machine it will work fine. I created a package to be able to create a schedule/required install and it always prompts for elevation when the endpoint tries to run the script. If I take that same script and copy it to the endpoint and try run it, it won’t run because the script is not remote signed. I am unable to set the execution to unsigned or bypass because we have the GPO set to only allow local scripts and remote signed. I’ve tried this as a domain admin and get the same result. We also have used the PSAppDeploy scripts before with no issue and those have stopped working too. I’m quite certain that the -bypass in the script is not working now either when it tries to run. We have been running this same setup for years and have not had this issue before. There is one code sign cert on the endpoints from ‘Microsoft’ that did expire a couple weeks ago but I don’t know where that came from or how to renew it. All the certs on the SCCM server are valid (but none of them are a code sign cert). We do have a CA and I’ve tried to create a code sign cert to push but I haven’t gotten that working yet. Any ideas as to why this would all of a sudden be an issue or how I can get this working?

                              <span>I have recently got an L2 job in a company where I have to perform operations on app servers i.e. fetching logs generated by app. (App is monolith and backend is developed in java and being served at tomcat). There are several other tasks performed by L3 regarding preparing environment e.g. installing mysql, pacemaker, web servers e.g. nginx, apache, tomcat, reverse proxies, load balancing, deploying SSL certificates and most important troubleshooting. I want to learn all these tasks and have been studying RHCSA course. At this point I am pretty familier with linux with a plus point of bash scripting. I want to learn all these tasks mentioned above so I could master in monolith deployment and could later proceed towards microservices architecture and Kubernetes. Rhcsa course doesn&#x27;t include most of the thing mentioned above. Please recommend me any good source where to master all these tasks from. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;&#x27;ve recently accepted a position as senior system engineer for a big company. 
 I&#x27;ve been in the role for 10y+, multiple small, medium and big firms, but what&#x27;ve found here is singular (for me).
 In every company i worked for, we used to have some kind of sandbox envoironmanet, some old vmware vsphere or cluster or cloud of some kind available for the only purpose of checking new technology, thinkering around, stay on the edge somehow. Here there&#x27;s nothing like that: all the envs must always stay in a &quot;working&quot; condition, and every new implementation must be approved, analized, and green lighted ON EVERY ENVIRONMENT.
 I talked to the management about that and they agreed it could be important to have a destructable and rebuiltable envs for study purposes, something agile, but also it&#x27;s not prioritized: it&#x27;s literally the last entry on the to-do list.
 Here it comes my question: there&#x27;s some kind of literature about the importance of having this kind of things? Something that would help my needs climbing the to-do list. 
 ​
 TLDR: My bosses are totaly ok with me standing idle if there&#x27;s nothing &quot;broken to fix&quot;, I&#x27;d love to them to provide us a R&amp;D env for playing. Looking for some literature to back my request

                              <span>Happy Sunday folks
 Our MSP set up an autopilot policy for us, it’s been working fine but doesn’t remember the last user signed in. Users therefore have to enter their username every time they want to unlock their machine. 
 For the life of me I can’t find where this setting is inside the settings picker. I can find “Interactive Logon Do Not Display Last Signed In” but this is not enabled. 
 I’m hoping to avoid having to rebuild the entire thing just to sort this out, so hopefully somebody has an answer!
 Enjoy the long weekend :)

 in these days I&#x27;m trying to implement different data loss prevention policies. However, I can&#x27;t implement the policy that allows me to block the sending of files containing sensitive information in the chat... has anyone already implemented a similar policy? Or can you help me implement them?

The domain verification passed when I uploaded a html verification file to where my website is hosted. I have added 3 CNAME (dkim) records and 1 text file record to cloudflare dns register for my domain. However my email dns record check keep failing. I raised a support ticket, however to no avail yet. My domain is from godaddy and I have pointed my ns records to cloudflare. On cloudflare for the 3 CNAME records I have tried changing from proxy to dns only and it still fails. Any advice on this will be great.

 We currently use ManageEngine Log360 which has AD Audit Plus, LogAnlayzer and Office 365 Manger
 Just currently looking around if anything better is around
 We are currently rolling out FortiGate&#x27;s and will be using FAZ for that aspect.
 ​
 We need to at the very least
 - AD Logging - Who logs in etc, Wrong Password Etc
 - File Server Logging - Who did what to what file and when and who accessed files
 ​
 We also want
 - SharePoint and Teams Logging - Who accessed a file in a SharePoint site - We currently have no way to tell this easily
 - Computer Logging - What time was computer logged in and by who - We are currently moving to Azure AD and loose this when we disjoin the computers from Active Directory and move to Azure AD only

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to achieve a situation where I can generate a persistent ssh host key every boot. My (custom) initramfs is build into the kernel which is signed and securely booted with my own PK in TPM.
 In the initramfs I have build tpm2-tools, dropbear and cryptsetup alike for decryption of the main rootFS, based on TPM2 PCRs/LUKS.
 Now in case any of the PCRs change the rootfs will not mount and I will be in a situation where I&#x27;ll have to ssh in and decide if I want to accept any changes in the PCR registers and add a new unseal policy to allow luks decryption which more or less works fine.
 The challenge comes that I do not store dropbear ssh host keys in the initramfs, figuring they would be readable from the signed efi kernel by taking out the bootdisk and thus would allow mitm/decryption of my ssh session while manually logging in to fix the pcr/luks decription.
 This makes it so that I get the obvious warning that the host key changed everytime I ssh into initramfs.
 My thinking is there should be a way to get, or more likely generate, a fixed host key from TPM/PCR to feed to dropbear that would not live on the boot disk.
 Anyone have any suggestions how to do this? All TPM/ssh examples I find are for the easy solution to store client keys, not the host key...

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I’ve recently been tasked with improving the file storage at work and I am not sure where to start. We are a small manufacturing company that deals primarily with cad files, pdfs, and spreadsheets. We don’t require collaboration on files, just a central storage solution with allowable permissions. We deal with sensitive information and are looking to become Itar compliant in the future, so it must be quite secure. Currently we just store information on hard drives, but we’d like a cloud solution to access anywhere. Anyone have any recommendations or sources?

                              <span>Have a few weeks of international travel coming up soon, and trying to see if there is a good way for me to just bring one laptop but isolate the company stuff and my personal stuff via dual boot.
 We have a company issued Lenovo laptop, fully managed by Microsoft Intune. I also have a personal Dell laptop, I can add that to my authorized device and access company resources.
 Brought two laptops last time I traveled and it was a PITA, hence wanting to bring only 1 laptop this time around, but want to make sure I isolate the company stuff and personal stuff completely.
 Thinking about the following options:
 1. Bring company Lenovo, install a copy of Windows into a portable SSD, and boot from the portable SSD when I need to use it for personal. 
 Pro is I can disconnect the SSD physically when I don&#x27;t need my personal stuff to isolate it. 
 Concern is if the company will be able to scan my personal data without me booting into the company copy of Windows(such as BIOS backdoor), and if it allow me to boot from portable SSD (this one I can test out).
 2. Bring my Dell laptop, install a copy of Windows into portable SSD and add it to authorized device to access company resources.
 Pro is I think the company control for personal device is less than corporate issued device, or at least they claim it to be.
 Concern is my personal data will be in the internal SSD and they may scan it if I boot from portable SSD and not remove the internal SSD.
 3. Bring my Dell laptop, install the company managed OS into internal drive, and install my personal OS into portable SSD.
 Probably the safer way, but more work and more PITA.
 ​
 Wonder what you think would be the best option in terms of data isolation from company IT admin perspective, appreciate any input you may have

                              <span>I work for a MSP and I&#x27;m taking over our workstation deployment department and have some plans to revamp our current solution to be more unified and streamlined. I was curious what other people are using. 
 We&#x27;re currently using two different methods for different solutions. A &quot;golden image&quot;+MDT for most people using on-prem or a USB &quot;golden image&quot; for Azure/Intune. 
 ​
 Things I&#x27;m looking to improve immediately:
 Update Caching (squid)
 Application installation automation (entertaining ideas, most likely going with a chocolatey/PS solution I&#x27;d write myself)

                              <span>This is probably my biggest issue for 3rd party tech support. When your ISP has a device that has either packet loss or high latency issues.
 Currently our ISP&#x27;s device has higher than normal latency. It&#x27;s a solid 70ms. I have tested pings from a few remote work buildings, my house and other tech houses. They are all the same. Every hop up to that point is low. Averaging below 20ms. But this last hop is always 70ms. It&#x27;s the ISP&#x27;s device in our building that connects to our firewall/router.
 Every trouble ticket we create with them goes nowhere. They say it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s fine for web traffic and stuff. But for VPN&#x27;s that users run windows file copies over it sucks! Due to the Windows SMB protocol acting like trash the higher the latency goes.
 Wish I knew a way to get it through to ISP&#x27;s for these kind of issues.

                              <span>I know this is an &#x27;older&#x27; switch to put it lightly, but we are running into some issues with some of our networks losing connectivity randomly. We have a palo alto router and the switch is acting as a l2 switch for several ESXi hosts, passing all traffic to the PA. Earlier we had some problems with certain networks in esxi not being able to reach the gateway and rebooting the switch resolved the issue, leading me to think it was an issue with an incomplete arp table. 
 The issues from earlier have now reoccurred with networks that were not experiencing the problems earlier. Has anyone seen this before in this or other l2 switches?

                              <span>Hi, I was going through a few guides to configure FFrouting on linux, and I see that for most things one would need to manually enter the vtysh shell and input commands there. I would like to make a script for this, but how do I get my script to either enter the vtysh mode and then input commands/run commands in privileged mode without accessing the vtysh like a normal user? I haven&#x27;t been able to find any method to do either from a shell script, I tried looking at how people would do it on Cisco hardware and see EEM scripts mentioned, but I don&#x27;t know how to adapt them to my situation.
 I am very new to configuring routing protocols on linux and writing scripts for such purposes, sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. Thanks a bunch!
  
Edit: Found the solution! I&#x27;m really stupid for not noticing this earlier, but you can use vtysh -c and chain commands, just like you would use sh -c to chain and send commands to the POSIX shell from a different shell. Same concept, explained in the mention of its options on vtysh.
 Thanks everyone, I&#x27;ll keep ansible in mind for next time!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a weird one and am not familiar with Meraki enough to understand how this is being done.
 The network is open, and when connected issues DNS servers quad 8 and quad 9. macOS opens the Captive Network Assistant window, and I can see the window trying captive.apple.com and then the captive portal domain which opens.
 But dig doesn&#x27;t work against the issued DNS servers, the router, or the DHCP server, +tcp or UDP. How is this possible?
 The DHCP server also did not give me Captive-Portal options (114, 103, 37).

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve a been a network engineer for over 10 years and a I&#x27;ve always had to use Windows for my work. Most of the time I&#x27;ve used SecureCRT and I&#x27;ve recently discovered Tabby (cool software, btw).
 I found out last week that my employer allows us to use our own devices for work and so I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll start using my Linux desktop.
 I&#x27;ve been wondering what terminal app those of you that drive Linux for daily work use, meaning how you organize your device connection profiles, ssh credentials, etc. Do you simply create command aliases for devices? Or do you have let&#x27;s say folders for locations, that hold one file per device in that location? Do you use build-in password managers?
 I&#x27;ll use Tabby as an example. It has built-in password vault, connection profiles can be organized into folders and it also has a quick-command dialog (ctrl-shift-p), just like vs-code does that quickly allows you to browse through the saved connections or (for example) save output to file, etc.
 Is there a network admin-friendly terminal in Linux or do you guys just use the standard terminal app?
 Thanks for any suggestions!

                              <span>In a Cisco DNA system where the network is a mix of normal enterprise and different OT networks. What will the best practice be for segmentation of the different OT networks? VN all the way? Or is SGT good enough?
 The OT networks use several different OT protocols, but a lot of them is &quot;pure&quot; L2 unicast and broadcast traffic (Profinet RT looking at you). I do not want to have interference between the OT networks.
 My gut feeling is telling me VN is the way to go, but since there is a limit in the amount of VN&#x27;s, I do wonder if there are some other solution?

                              <span>I have a Speedport Entry 2i router from Telekom. Yesterday there was a storm in my area but I disconnected the router out of electricity before the storm started. However, after the storm, my router started behaving weird. After that, only the lights of Power and WLAN were turned on. However, if I turn on my pc, and this router is connected through an ethernet with it, and I navigate to 192.168.1.1 -&gt; status -&gt; Refresh, the ADLS, Online and Telephone lights start turning on one by one and my Wifi works perfectly again. I tried physically restarting the router but no luck. Basically, WiFi works only when I have my pc, connected through an ethernet with my router, turned on and have the router refreshed software-wise from 192.168.1.1. Before calling the custom support, does anyone stumbled upon an issue like this and do you know what could be the cause? Could it be that my router is broken or some signaling/networking issue is present?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking for a job since September. Junior sysadmin and other IT jobs have been scarce, especially lately. Competition is insane right now as well. 
 Previously I&#x27;ve made multiple interviews and even reached round 3 at some but still haven&#x27;t landed anything. This was with small and medium size companies and even had 2 rounds with a FAANG. I&#x27;m getting very frustrated and disheartened and try to remind myself there&#x27;s other people feeling like I do. I&#x27;m not used to being without a job, since being laid off lately. 
 I&#x27;ve been studying for a cert hoping it&#x27;s going to help me in the long run, but the exam was hard as hell for me.
 Sorry, I just needed to vent somewhere and to someone.

 ​
 I want to get an AZ-104. I&#x27;m at $100k/yr base salary. Will I be able to get more on the cloud?
 ​
 Curious what you think. I want to specialize on cloud moving forward as tech is moving that way.

                              <span>Got 4x pm9a3 U.2 Drives setup in a raid 0 as a a scratch drive.
 I will run an FIO speed test and normally the first time after building the raid/booting it will get the speeds it should around 25gb/s and maintain it as long as I let the test run.
 If I stop the test and restart the exact same command it will only get speeds of 11gb/s most of the time, although sometimes I can restart the test once or twice before it will drop.
 Write speeds are always fine at around 15gb/s even when the reads are stuck at 11gb/s
 I have tested the drives individually and they seem to remain stable at around 6.5gb/s, using the same commands, regardless of how many times I start the test.
 To make things even stranger, if I only create a raid of 3 devices I get the ~18gb/s it should but then the speed will drop to 11gb/s with this as well!
 Example of raid command I am using:
 mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md/nvme --name&#x3D;nvme --level&#x3D;0 --raid-devices&#x3D;4 /dev/nvme[1-4]n1
 Using the FIO commands from here, although I have tried tweaking them but doesn&#x27;t seem to help.https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/benchmarking-pd-performance
 It has to be formatted as xfs.
 It is a dual socket 64core epyc milan system, all drives are connected to the same CPU.
 I am at a loss, any ideas?
 EDIT: Was messing with it and decided to try removing the sudo from the command, and suddenly it went to full speed again, then when I tried to run the command again, back to half speed.
 Seems anytime I change the user running the command it will work the first time, this is WAY over my head!

 The system has now failed and I have that drive, I can&#x27;t figure out how to recover from it. 
 Please roast me but can you also let me know how I can actually get data back from this drive?

                              <span>I recently posted my issue about a SQL server logs rapidly growing with no Google-able fix found. A fix was found, and it turned out that a replication to a data warehouse server was broken, and the data failures were logged and never released. We killed the replication properly and the log reduction was instant.
 The only change I made was migrating the data warehouse server to our new vmware environment (new hosts, data stores, vswitches, everything) from the prior vmware environment shared by my SQL server. 
 Would this have been my issue? That the migration broke some non TCP-IP connection? Or was this coincidental?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I hoping you all can tell me if it&#x27;s worth fighting everyone all the time.
 Background: I&#x27;m (28) very young for my team(infrastructure management and architecture) being that that my closest coworker in age is about 15 years older then myself and young for the department as a whole where most people around my age seem to be on the help desk or a jr application admin. So I do tend to deal with imposter syndrome but I think I deal with it well as I&#x27;m definitely qualified for the work. 
 I&#x27;m the administer of our on prem virtual environment but have input on our service model and offering because I will have to maintain it.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Do you guys know about any software or tools that I can use to roll out apps, require updates, deploy network profiles, and see battery health and disk space available?
 The summer camp I work for recently acquired a fleet of laptops for some classes and activities. I told them that it would be a good idea for us to be able to manage the laptops from a central location to be able to keep an eye on all of them and keep them ready for classes.
 I have been looking at open RMM and MDM solutions and have tested MeshCentral and Fleet but I am wondering if I am looking for the wrong products.
 Ideally I am looking for a solution that we can host on-premises without requiring a subscription or license, or a service we can rent that would cost less than a few hundred dollars a year for about 100-200 devices.
 Thanks and sorry in advanced if this is the wrong forum or the post is not formatted correctly.

                              <span>We are implementing S/MIME for our email security. But we are facing challenges with mobile platforms because outlook for android and IOS do not support S/MIME (wtf?)... So, what mobile clients would you recommend? or is that even a thing? Management required support for mobile platforms, but IMO because we are govermental agency having highly-confidential info in email is a bad idea, these should not be available on unmanaged/personal devices.
 Apreciate you sharing your experiences and recommendations.
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Our campus is a bit of a mix and match and we have some printers dedicated to departments which rarely use them and could easily use the printer of a nearby department just a few feet away. We are yet to step up our game on department mapping based on location in our AD structure and some departments are split with team members in two different building/office locations. What is the easiest way to tackle having one common printer per floor and building and making sure Bob in building A part of team B is not sending a print job of 1000 copies to Building D a few kilometers away. 
 We are thinking of implementing pin based printing to prevent these spam prints as a precaution, let me know what practices you guys have used before to tackle this type of scenario effectively.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a system as a support engineer that has a policy that enforces TLS on the outbound. I&#x27;m just trying to check something is working and need to spin up a machine for this. I was thinking an ec2 running iredmail and reducing the tls to 0. This might take a bit of time to configure. Does anyone know of any much faster services I could use to send an email to a server that has no TLS configured on it?

                              <span>I use Event Viewer in Windows 10 Home and Pro to check when the system was started, shut down, sleep or wakes, etc.
 I noticed that some Event ID numbers change over time, like Microsoft changes them with Windows updates for some reason?. 
 For example, 4624 LogonType 7 was used 1 year ago or so, now it is not used. So I now use 4738 to check if a user signed in entering the pw.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any insights.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m currently running a more or less consumer computer at home with Hyper-V Server 2019, with two Windows VM&#x27;s (one is a Domain Controller) and five Linux VM&#x27;s. 
 Now.. afaik Hyper V Server is discontinued, so there will be no 2022 version. Support for it though will continue until 2019, so this should be the issue. My question tho is:
 What should be better?
  
Hyper-V Server 2019 with two Windows VM&#x27;s and five Linux VM&#x27;s
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V role and two Windows VM&#x27;s and five Linux VM&#x27;s
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V &amp; Domain Controller roles, one Windows VM and five Linux VM&#x27;s.
  
Any ideas?
 About the third option: I rarely encounter an issue where my Domain Controller VM isn&#x27;t reachable or up, which could result in auth issues with my Hyper-V server, which is part of the domain, so both bundled together would more or less elminate the issue.
 I know there&#x27;s already this thread, but this is now 3 years older and is about Windows Server with Desktop, so a lil&#x27; bit different.

 what are the differences between Privileged Identity Management and Entitlement management in Azure AD? They seem to basically offer the same features? Are there any recommendations when to use what? Should one be preferred in general? 
 Thanks :)

                              <span>What I want. 
  
buy a license, activate the windows in a VM in hyperv. Can run the machine for years or destroy it next month, create a new VM, fresh install, activate. As long as you are not attempting to run two VMs with same license you are good.
  
What I suspect
  
Once that VM is activated you better not &quot;lose&quot; that VM. The license is tight to some HW ID of that one VM, reinstalls can be done on that one machine.
  
What I fear
  
Oh you cant even use the typical win pro license in hyperv. you have to buy windows server 2016, 2019, 2022,.. special license with whatever cal sublinceses for machines/users that would connect to that machine

 Anybody have any workarounds? I know I read fairly recently this was coming, but was surprised how angry I actually was when I encountered it -- the fact it was after hours on a holiday weekend Friday didn&#x27;t help I guess.

                              <span>On my JG962A, after unplugging the unit because the power cable was blocking a new Synology Cable Arm, upon restoring power I&#x27;ve recently started receiving this PoE Alarm message:
 Trap 
: PSE 4, IfIndex 5, Detection Status 1 (or Status 3)
 This happens on every port that is capable of using PoE. I&#x27;ve tried a firmware update, factory reset, and then leaving the system unplugged for over 5 minutes.
 Is there anything else I can do to resolve the issue?
 (Edit: Clarify the two different Status # &amp; PoE works when testing with Fluke)

We need to be able to control who logs on (aka, who contributes to the monthly bill) and have monthly data caps. There would be 10-20 users. From what I&#x27;ve researches we need a router or switch with a built in radius server, or need to make a stand alone radius server.... while I could cobble something together, It would be nice to have a commercial off the shelf system, that a non tech savvy melinial could manage.... anyone have any suggestions?

 I’ve been tasked with looking at ONIE switching for our 2 rack colo deployment. 
 The reason for ONIE is a management push but I am hesitant and pushing back. 
 While I can see the benefit for larger networks, I don’t know that there will be enough resources to manage it at the current moment or if it makes sense. (If it is easier than I think it to be please share your experiences) Also licensing costs. 
 This would be a 1G Fiber uplink for the first year then it would bump up to 10G on year two. 
 Ideally it would be great to future proof it to an extent. (SFP28 of SFP+ as an example.)
 EdgeCore and Dell ON series are switches that have come up frequently during my research but have not had direct experience with them in the past.

                              <span>I am having a Cineshooter motion control device with me for my personal hobby filming. I would like to control it manually by sending movement data from a microcontroller(ESP32). Kessler crane has documentation regarding their kOS network protocol to communicate with their motion control products. But I do not get, what is the format(Data-type) in which we are supposed to send the data? Should we send in the exact byte order(Big endian) that has been mentioned? Is there an easier way to do this?

 I noticed that most people here use either cisco or juniper. And my question might sounds dumb or very basic. But i still want to learn lol.

I would allow them to assign trunks shut down trunks etc. 
 CLI with priv levels wouldn&#x27;t be a solution. I need something more user friendly and easy to read. I tried playing with https GUI but i can&#x27;t seem to make priv levels to work. I managed either readonly or full access. I tried to define a priv level 5 that would allow some commands, in CLI works but in GUI it doesn&#x27;t.

                              <span>So, people in our Azure AD Tenant have been creating groups with very strange names, examples being:
 ​
 CompanyName_FC-QA_AccountMgr-Clinician
 I don&#x27;t see the point of making a group with underscores and dashes mixed, then some other groups and literally just dashes, and then the rest of it just spaces..
 ​
 Is it my OCD, or would this drive you insane? Especially the underscores.

Now the vm&#x27;s are failing. Along with the disks. One at a time. The installed ssd of untouched. Mind you, he put the os on a 12tb drive. Everything is slow even moreso the vm&#x27;s. How the hell do I fix this.

                              <span>I’m searching for a new job in the Chicago area after being a “Tech Director” for a small school district. I don’t know what the proper title would be outside of education. I’m not a director as it would commonly be defined. I manage all technology in the district — planning, budgeting, implementation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Network, servers, security, etc, etc. I have a part time technician that I manage. 
 I know a little about everything but I don’t know if I know enough about any particular sets of skills. I’m also scared I have learned bad habits from being solo for so long. Everything I’m looking at job-wise either seems too advanced or too entry-level. 
 Just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar spot and what the outcome was.

                              <span>Our company is seriously considering Netsuite. What are the pitfalls of using this software. We have sapbuinessone and our accounting dept gave up using it and we just use a warehouse and manufacturing third party module. We have a developer that would do the same in netsuite. We are considering it but thinking to push implementation to 1st quarter next year as it looks like it’s going to run up against our busy manufacturing season. Netsuite is on the hard sell to sign the paper before the end of may as it’s “the best prices you will get all year”. Is that true? Are end of year may prices better than what we will get in February I feel we are dealing with used car salespeople. I mean I get a call from a rookie Dell salesman and I swear every month is their end of quarter.

                              <span>For about the past month we&#x27;ve been chasing our tails on a pretty awful performance impacting issue with Checkpoint Harmony on our endpoints. Checkpoint says no one else is having this level of problems. Id like to hear from others using Harmony one way or the other.
 Symptoms include 
  
abysmally slow file copies between two Windows explorer windows, even on the same SSD drive
 Outright abends of programs
 Huge laggy performance issues in M365 apps
 Unbelievably slow saves when using mainstream apps like Autodesk Inventor

 We added them with IISCrypto but the issue continues. We run a query in sql and after a few minutes we get disconnected from the server and when trying to reconnect we get the Internal error has occurred. A reboot fixes this.
 Once we log back in we see a lot of dcom errors and various services shutting down ( this is before we reboot) we occasionally see pagefault errors in the sql logs as well.

                              <span>I was excited to have been a part of giving Phishing training for our employees along with the phishing button add-on for their outlook emails. All was well for a few months, then I started to notice a huge uptick in phishing alerts being sent my way. 
 At first co-workers were doing very well in identifying the phishing tests and seemed to like the phishing alert buttons convenience. But I think the button has now become TOO convenient. 
 Most of the phish alerts I get are not phishing emails, some are emails that we are sending for employees to do cyber security training OR they are emails from things they have subscribed to, so now the button is being used like its a filter for emails they just don&#x27;t want to read. 
 Should I just send out a mass email explaining the importance of using the phishing alert button correctly? Re-do training? or just be happy they are using it at all? 
 I mean, it doesn&#x27;t take that much time for me to see that most of the alerts aren&#x27;t important, but it does take a bit of time to go through them all to find the actual phishing attempts. 
 ​
 TLDR: Employees are spamming phishing alert button for emails they don&#x27;t like, should I re-do training, send email, or care at all?

                              <span>Hi All, We are a UK SME who has recently been subject to a phishing campaign where the attacker has cloned our website on similar domains and sent our mailshot to attract victims. UK authorities are simply not interested at this juncture as we can not prove any financial loss, but he got pretty close recently. I keep issuing takedown request on these domains which has been relatively prompt, but the lack of interest from Instagram and UK mobile providers has been disappointing to say the least. I get the impression this will go on ad-infimum until we are significantly more proactive in our defence.
 Obviously, this is not the forum for legal advice, but from a technological perspective has anyone experience of or alternatives to Domains tools Iris Detect to monitor for lookalike domains please? Indeed any other UK specific advice would be very welcome.
 Many thanks

                              <span>I found out during our last renewal that our Microsoft partner cleared house on the team that would help with EA renewals and pumped up the team for CSP. I&#x27;ve been through the CSP slides, we want to stay with the EA. I&#x27;m starting my prep for our EA renewal and would love a Microsoft partner that will still work with us on the renewal. Anyone have a MS partner that would recommend for EA renewals?

                              <span>Hi,
 We market a software solution that runs in the cloud or on our infrastructure for most of our customers. One of our customers (very large for our situation) insists that if we want to continue the collaboration we need to migrate the service to their servers (excuses about standards and regulations, middle management and users want to expand, IT is blocking us, senior management is labile). The problem is that we are afraid for our intellectual property, because their IT department (4x bigger than our whole company) is doing similar things to what we offer to the market. 
 So I wonder, is it possible to encrypt a virtual server running on someone else&#x27;s physical server in such a way that the owner of the physical server cannot bypass the protection?
 They run VMWare EXSi, we run HyperV, and my knowledge of VMware is quite limited, so a detailed explanation would be appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a sys admin myself, but In my line of work I have acquired a lot of decommissioned hardware. Mostly routers, switches, and APs.
 Most have been removed from the original company portal when it was given to me, but occasionally they forget and it&#x27;s pain in the ass. In other situations, the original company no longer even exists and all the equipment leftover from a take-over is stuck in limbo.
 Are there brands that are particularly troublesome and not as safe or easy to wipe for resell?
 To name a few I have:
  
Aruba - I&#x27;m told that transferring the license from locked aruba equipment can be particularly difficult even when 
 Cisco
 Meraki - Someone mentioned the are essentially bricks?
 Ubiquiti - I&#x27;m told as long as these are fully reset it should wipe their portal information out
 Juniper
 Peplink
 Netgear
 Fortinet
 Tp-Link
  
I might be missing some others.

 Even with the headers there isn&#x27;t always a single easy to spot way to see what triggered it.

 Never say never - especially to the management!
 So in Q1 this stupid OKR was set to &quot;reduce running costs by 10% by the end of the year&quot; by a management who doesn’t have any idea how things work in IT. They complain that we have too many subscriptions, claiming that surely there are a few that aren&#x27;t essential, without even knowing which tool does what. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s more about workplace politics than facing the reality so we had to keep that OKR and &quot;see what we can do.&quot; (rolling_eyes)
 I started thinking (googling) about my options to achieve more process efficiency and cost optimization. After searching through blogs, subreddits and lots of clickbait, I came across an article about using the right tools correctly to improve your processes.…</span>

                              <span>Howdy all! Part of our business process includes receiving images from out in the wild for damage claims. Recently, Apple and Samsung have started using HEIC as a default format, and it&#x27;s driving our claims folks nuts since there&#x27;s no easy way to open them without the 99 cent converter (which, since it&#x27;s needed to be purchased from the windows store per user account, has been a fairly unattractive option). 
 The only work around we&#x27;ve found so far is providing the few folks who handle the incoming images with a copy of GIMP, but it&#x27;s far from an elegant solution when there&#x27;s a couple dozen images needing to be converted one at a time. In addition, we&#x27;re starting to see the format pop up more often with remote folks sending in photos of forms with PII on them, so online converters are completely out of the question. 
 Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

                              <span>My cabling desires have led me to leveraging top-of-rack (TOR) switches instead of our typical home-running of everything back to centralized Ethernet and Fibre Channel core switches. Things were quite simple before, boy does this add some complexity and consideration for someone new to this topology.
 Before the edge TOR’s came into play, physical links and zoning defined redundancy and boundaries, ALUA did its magic ensuring utilization of optimal paths.

                              <span>hey all, 
 you guys have any recommendations for a good reliable wireless office headset? my company is a medium size staffing firm of about 170 employees, all using softphones on their laptops. the offices tend to get a bit crowded on certain days so I want to avoid bluetooth devices. 
 right now, we have about half Jabra engage 65s (great headset but discontinued and expensive) and the other half are yealink WH62s (constant problems with the mic or speakers not working, and confusing for users). 
 is there any modern DECT headset that doesnt suck?

 I dont mind setting up each one individually and prefer a free solution as this is a very small business.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get CodeTwo&#x27;s Exchange Online Picture manager installed, when I try to authenticate with my admin 365 account, it gives me this: 
 AADSTS700016: Application with identifier &#x27;[app id identifier i didn&#x27;t setup]&#x27; was not found in the directory &#x27;[companyname]&#x27;. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. You may have sent your authentication request to the wrong tenant. 
 I&#x27;ve tried a combination of looking on CodeTwos troubleshooting forums and install guides and most of them are for installing the paid software and creating an app registration in Azure. Even if I create an app registration in azure for CodeTwo and assign the permissions the guide says, I don&#x27;t see a way to connect that app registration to code two since registering an app automatically generates an app ID that&#x27;s different from the one displayed in that error message with no way to change it. 
 My question is, how am I supposed to register an application in Azure that isn&#x27;t in the Azure App Library when I can&#x27;t assign the applications identifier to that registration, as well as not being able to change the identifier of the application because I didn&#x27;t make it. (All the guides on how to change an app ID seem to be to the tune of &quot;adjust it in the code&quot;) 
 I was looking into it potentially being a misconfigured consent issue, since we don&#x27;t get the &quot;The app needs the following permissions&quot; and &quot;Consent on behalf of your organization page&quot;, but I&#x27;m not exactly clear on how to enable that either. 
 Any help from the hivemind is greatly appreciated.

 The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server olddc$. The target name used was cifs/OLDDC.TCH.local. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account password is different than what is configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target service. Ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the server name is not fully qualified, and the target domain (.LOCAL) is different from the client domain (.LOCAL), check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.

After the interviews, was told they want to make me an offer and we negotiated a salary that we both agreed too. Was told almost two weeks ago that everything looked good and they would work on getting an official offer letter out.
 Since then, no offer letter has been sent. I&#x27;ve emailed both the IT and Hiring manager and have gotten no response. Fearing the worst.
 Anyone else have something similar happen to them?

                              <span>TL;DR
 I work as an online developer for a large tech company (+20k employees worldwide).
 As a basically Windows-only shop, how difficult is it for a company like this to allow and authorize Linux dev machines?
 I imagine there are security considerations (patching/updates) and other stuff. Is it reasonable that they give us a &quot;hard no&quot; on this request?
 Background (if you want more details):
 Many of us prefer to work in a native Linux environment, but this is not authorized by our company. Since pretty much have free reign over our dev machines, some of us have installed Linux in dual boot. Others use a Linux bootable USB.
 These actions aren&#x27;t authorized by IT, but so far, our local IT guys have been sympathetic and have adopted a &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; kind of attitude, which works for us.
 Many devs don&#x27;t want to risk it, and use WSL. Most complain about it all day (stability, perf, etc..)
 We&#x27;d like to stop working in the shadows and get official authorization from our IT dept. We&#x27;re wondering if they&#x27;re just &quot;lazy/inept&quot;, or if supporting Linux in a large company like this is prohibitively complex/expensive.

                              <span>Upfront - I&#x27;m underwhelmed by antivirus and EDR providers. Perhaps I&#x27;m suffering from working in a small company (just 100 endpoints), so maybe the products are better than my experiences so far.
 We are with Cybereason, currently on NGAV but due to replace with EDR in September. The support has been awful. For example, Cybereason is currently detecting itself (coreminion.dll) as being Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/). But only on one machine. I&#x27;ve seen other examples of legit software flagged on a handful of our endpoints, but not on most. It&#x27;s just so wildly inconsistent, despite everything being in the same policy group, updated, and so on.
 Crowdstrike - looked promising, but awful sales experience. I&#x27;ve been blunt about how our purchasing decisions are made (we have an annual budget - if it isn&#x27;t in that, it&#x27;s not happening) and given windows when it&#x27;s good to speak (i.e. two months before I confirm my budget for next year!). This doesn&#x27;t stop me being harassed by calls and emails, including one rather embarrassing &quot;My manager said I&#x27;m in trouble for giving you this price, but I can honour it if you buy now!&quot; call.
 Watchguard - support was absolutely appalling, and their Panda EDR client trashed our Linux laptops.
 So, two questions:
  
Have I just been unfortunate with Cybereason - are those on the EDR or MDR solution finding a more pleasant time. What is your feedback?
 Are AV providers just shitty, or is it because we&#x27;re such a small account? Would we be better using a MSSP? I&#x27;m wary of MSSPs because I&#x27;ve worked for a few MSPs who have tried their hand at security, and I&#x27;d not trust them anywhere near our small estate.
  
I&#x27;d be grateful for thoughts.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have noticed that there is a lot of regular usage for Skype for Business within Discovered Apps in Cloud Discover within security.micorosft.com.
 Skype for Business is not installed and shouldn&#x27;t be used by any user.
 A new users with a freshly built laptop is also logging Skype for Business usage, when they have only used Teams.
 Here&#x27;s my question. Is this the Microsoft portal reporting Teams calls as Skype? I cant find anything anywhere online to prove it either way!
 Thanks in advance!!!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am struggling a bit to find the fastest way to delete mail from people&#x27;s mailboxes when there is a security incident. For the past two weeks we have had multiple comprised users falling for phishing. We have monthly simulations, have phishing set to aggressive block in M365, various endpoint lockdowns, external header flagging, external banner flagging, the MS setting that says, &quot;you don&#x27;t regular get mail from this person, etc.&quot; We also block many top level domains in DNS filter, block new domain, etc. If anything the complaints from the execs and users are &quot;too much email security.&quot;
 Despite all this, stuff comes through. M365 will alert us but unless it is in quarantine, I can&#x27;t find a way to easily delete it for box that it exists in. What &#x27;sometimes&#x27; works is
 ​
  
Connect-ExchangeOnline
  
Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName  * New-ComplianceSearch -name &quot;suspicious emails&quot; -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery &#x27;subject:&quot;suspicious&quot;&#x27; * Start-ComplianceSearch “suspicious emails” * New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName “suspicious emails” -purge -purgetype SoftDelete/HardDelete
 This is cumbersome and does not always complete due to powershell errors and/or our team rushing to get it done fast. Last night it would not accept the &#x27;purge&#x27; argument for reasons I did not determine. I also need to set the security to &quot;winrm basic&quot; to run this and then change it back again when done.
 reference https://www.codetwo.com/admins-blog/new-compliancesearch-new-version-of-search-mailbox/
 I am also trying to delete from Trace \ go hunt for this message&quot; \ &quot;advanced hunting&quot; and though I find the mail and take action to delete it, it does not appear to delete.
 What I am looking for is to the fastest way, ideally through the GUI, to locate all mails from a sender and /or subject and delete.
 Thx!

                              <span>Hi All,
 We use Veeam. I am considering moving away from tapes to immutable storage for our &quot;offline&quot; backups. I was wondering how many of us have done that, and what your experience and comfort level with that decision has been.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings fellow sysadmins,
 I’m looking to find a good solution for storing secure documents. For clarification, these are not physical documents. These are things like word docs that have all of our server configuration information; data center documents with our network diagrams, firewall info, etc.; and even documents where we keep things like vendor account information. 
 I know with 365 we can set document restrictions, but that just doesn’t feel like enough. So, what are you all using to store these sensitive documents in a place that can be set up with access lists for team members? Any and all suggestions welcome at this point.

                              <span>Hello,
 Been struggling lately with a project. Everything is behind NDA with too small group knowing about it and it&#x27;s starts to affect the performance. There is just too much to do in a small time window, that I&#x27;m getting the feeling that we have to either:
 a) attain more people to help on project
 b) postpone some aspects for later implementation, but that would be seen as bad plannig on my end 
 but..
 a) C-level don&#x27;t want to involve any more people. Straight up no, just drop the topic.
 b) Deadline is set. There is some serious $$ involved and I&#x27;m sure they would rather fail partly and fix it after the deadline.. but that would be my problem to fix later on , while they will put the blame one someone else. 
 Another idea was to persuade most of project members to my ideas, but that takes time, which is running out. My question is how do you find a workaround in those situations and go with how you propose? 
 P.S. and please, no &quot;CY@/leave as see what they do&quot;, cause in the end, when the milk was already spilled and you get the blame or bad looks it&#x27;s already too late, since there seems to be distrust whether you are capable of working on bigger projects..

                              <span>I’m considering changing part of my approach to how I manage filtering of DNS and web requests. 
 I currently have EDR software installed on all workstations and DNS filtering software in place, however, I still see phishing from the plethora of new TLD’s. In particular, the whole .zip and .mov TLD debacle got me thinking.
 Don’t get me wrong, the spam filters GENERALLY catch the phishing, but they’re not 100% and I really like defense in depth.
 I’d like to change to whitelisting TLD’s instead of blacklisting. Obvious I’d need the usual suspects like .com, .gov, .mil, national domain’s etc. I’d probably also add some of the newer ones that actually see some legit traffic like .museum. 
 Has anyone done this? What lessons did you learn and what pitfalls should I watch out for?
 Thanks!

We frequently get reports from clients about Trend popping up saying &quot;Upgrading Trend Micro Apex One to the latest version will take a few minutes&quot; The clients already have the latest client, rebooting doesn&#x27;t seem to make it go away and re-install is the only fix. Any reason why this is happening? Is it on the server end? Or something is wrong with the client.

 The same 51GB file copied to a mount point (C:\clusterstorage\volume1) transfers at 410MB/s and takes minutes. 
 It&#x27;s the same thing with exporting a VM. Anything on the mountpoint is slow. Anything on a mapped drive is really fast and it&#x27;s tested on different hosts in different sites. 
 It&#x27;s the same situation on a cluster in a different site and MPIO is configured as per the SAN vendor&#x27;s documentation. 
 Hoping someone will have some suggestions.

                              <span>There is a great deal of user-generated content out there, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos, but we&#x27;ve generally tried to keep that off of the front page due to the volume and as a result of community feedback. There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Just wondered what everyone&#x27;s preference was, do you use 365 desktop apps or online? Indeed the advantages of both but have been using online only for the last few months. The only thing I sometimes find irritating is if I&#x27;m working on something from our on prem server , I need to upload to one drive or SharePoint to open it. 
 Oh and teams isn&#x27;t eating up resources.

                              <span>Hiya guys, I have recently started a job at a new IT company and I&#x27;m about 3 months in. I&#x27;m really liking it and want to progress in to Internal IT when I&#x27;m off my probation. 
 Is there a rough guideline of what Certifications or Knowledge I&#x27;d need to have to get on to the Internal IT team? I have a massive curiosity for Sysadmin work and I&#x27;m really interested in AD. 
 I also have a massive wealth of knowledge in Hardware both Consumer and Professional (Servers, Blade Servers etc.) 
 As for trying to find out about requirements internally I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m in a position to ask about that considering how new I am. 
 Cheers lads.

                              <span>Hello, I want to ask whether some of you have an experience with resetting passwords from printer Sharp MX-4141N and MX-301W. A previous admin has changed all the passwords and unfortunately didn&#x27;t sync them correctly, which means all the passwords weren&#x27;t saved. I have found a video on YouTube where someone can reset passwords by opening a case and switching off a button on motherboard of a printer. I don&#x27;t really know if that can work but I suppose so. Any other ideas would be appreciated, because a technician wants 200 dollar pro printer and we don&#x27;t have that much money. Thank you all

                              <span>Found out that the previous sysadmin handled to a vendor a server to &quot;do admin stuff&quot; for their application. Told me, before resigning, that &quot;they manage it so don&#x27;t worry&quot;.
 Yea sure. I never logged on to it as i thought it was actually managed (this was my mistake)
 Since it was 2012r2 (we are in the process of upgrading) i logged on today with my admin credentials... and they don&#x27;t work. I check the documentation and find out that there is a password. 
 Obviously .\administrator.
 Turns out:
 The server is not joined to the domain, no windows license configured, just one dns, local administrator, no antivirus, UAC disabled, no antivirus, last windows patch january 2020, anydesk installed.
 A poster for worst practice.
 Will be nuked today.

                              <span>Hi Reddit Hoping you can help me out. I’ve been given last min work and I’ve not been involved in the project. We are certifying for cyber essential plus and I have a few questions around the audit it’s self. I can’t get out of this as it some thing they are doing 
 Q1. Colleague access 365 services from personal devices, we control access by in tune MEM. With additional policy’s around OS levels. Colleagues require to authenticate one a week with MFA. Would it be fair in saying on the day of the audit only devices that have accessed info on that week would be under scope? If so what testing do they actually under go. We allow iOS, andriod and windows devices to access info this way. 
 Q2. The requirements are that os levels be up todate, but looking more in to requirements is it fair to say that andriod 11 would be complaint Os as this is still recieving support ?

 Looking to get ahead of the curve on this before it gets enabled, has anyone got wind of methods to disable Windows copilot being automatically installed? I imagine there&#x27;ll be a KB numbered update to block.

                              <span>Hello, I hope I can have help around my question as I am fighting on for days. Forgive me my broken English also.
 Due to organizational matter, In my company we need to see/list in udadmin into our license server only the devices connected, not the users. Surfing for days around the net I understand that it probably depends on the License Type and on how are installed.
 The strange thing is that a couple of those device we have are already listed like this and they connect/show as device (thin clients) without listing the username as well. For the rest we use also windows laptops as well so we have a mix. We own a Citrix On-Prem server where the employees connect to their desktop via ICA/Receiver.
 Is there a way to re-install the license and associate it per device and not per user on the physical machine? Any hints? Citrix Inc. seems like to be very conservative and limited about it, and I couldn’t find much around the net.
 Thank you! 😊

 Edit: There&#x27;s a more recent energize update from 08:22, 3.2.3.109198 - installed that and it seems to have fixed the issue.

 Let’s say replacing the system is not an option and running a new cable is not an option, what are some ways I can extend the wireless network? The solution doesn’t have to be super cheap but would want to keep it under 500/600. 
 Are there any decent Wi-Fi extenders or something out there?

 Say you got an old NetApp (Release 9.1P10) filer that serves data to a bunch of clients (via CIFS, NFS, iSCSI, etc). You have no idea what servers/VMs/machines use that storage, but you need to find out. What is the easiest way to do that? Can you see that from the NetApp cli or gui?

                              <span>Hi,
 we have small issue with some contacts. We using a 3rd party software that syncs a global addressbook to an addional addressbook for each user (mainly for reverse number lookup for iOS).
 These contacts have filled the &quot;file as&quot; field with &quot;surname, name&quot;. I can see that in each vCard and in some contacts in the default list overview. But not in all.
 If i open the vcard, safe as an other format its directly shown. 
 Its not a bug in the software. We checked that with the vendor. Did anybody of you have an idea?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I recently replaced a Cisco switch with a Fortinet 148F and can not get the 9951 phone expansion modules working. The phones display a message that they are unable to power the accessory. I reached out to Fortinet and it sounded as though there may be a known bug but the workaround they provided didn&#x27;t resolve anything. I have a number of switches to replace and don&#x27;t want to run into this issue at future sites. Has anyone come across this?

 One of my sites is supporting unmanaged, air-gapped, flat networks just to satisfy a vendor who frankly appears to be stuck in 1988. No spanning-tree, no vlan tags, etc

                              <span>Anyone here have any experience with Nokia 7360 OLT&#x27;s and them doing IGMP proxy back to edge routers? We use 7750&#x27;s here, but any routers really? I am being told by Nokia that the 7360&#x27;s will only allow the proxy to be configured to remove the SSM source that the settop STB sends to the OLT, and change the IGMP joins to *,G joins, and therefore we must do IGMP translations on the edge routers to get them back to SSM IGMP joins, and that is the standard for NOKIA and all ISP do it that way.
 Anyone doing this today and not doing it this way, or doing it this way?
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never understood how this could be possible, maybe you folks have some ideas. It&#x27;s not an issue at present but a problem I never got an answer to. We would see this usually when a specific firewall model was about to fail and starts acting buggy and shortly after totally dead (needing reboots and dropping connections the weeks leading up to failure sort of thing). Seen the exact scenario at least 3 times with this hardware.
 Anyhow when the FW would have it&#x27;s issues devices on the LAN would also stop working bringing, basically the entire switch is affected for locally hosted programs that typically continue to work when internet is down otherwise. We replace the FW with a new model all is fine of course, but it&#x27;s alwaysbleft me confused.
 My question though is how is the L3 firewall/gateway managing to screw up a dumb switch for L2 communication? I understand while it&#x27;s having issues internet may not work but this phenomenon feels like it violates everything I learned about the OSI model?? 
 I can only think something with ARP getting messed up or basically FW overloading the switch and basically DoS it? 
 Simple flat layout. Single LAN/24, dumb switch, no VLANs, nothing crazy configuration-wise

                              <span>Hi all, Happy Friday and all that jazz.
 Have any of you smart folks out there deployed these CBS350 switches from Cisco?
 I&#x27;ve recently deployed a 2x CBS350-48FP-4X stack and the CPU is pinned at 100% during production hours. There&#x27;s a 2x CBS350-24FP-4X stack in the same location with an almost identical config and that thing is fine.
 I usually work with IOS derived devices but this seems to be an &quot;ROS&quot; device and the usual &#x27;show process cpu sorted&#x27; etc commands don&#x27;t exist.
 This problem exists on 3.2 and 3.3 (the latest as of writing this) firmwares.
 The stack is based in a hub office and the config isn&#x27;t complicated, it has 9 APs, 2 firewalls in HA, 2 routers in HA, a couple of door entry controllers, a cctv dvr, a couple of ACLs and 1 static route. There are no cameras plugged into …</span>

 ​
 i - Internal untagged, I - Internal tagged, v - VLT untagged, V - VLT tagged
 NUM Status Description Q Ports
 * 1 Active &quot;Default_vlan&quot; U Gi 1/1,1/3-1/40
 2 Active &quot;DMZ&quot; T Gi 1/47-1/48
 T Te 1/49-1/50
 T Gi 2/47-2/48
 If i create port 2 in vlan2 i get an expected ip so im convinced its todo with vlan1 not showing untagged 1/50?
 ​
 any idea how to add vlan1 to port 1/50?

 I travel home in 2 hours so sorry for the clickbait title

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for some sort of routing-protocol or other function/mechanic that can solve my following problem:
 I have an HQ and a side-branch (SB). They are connected via EtherLink (~ 200km distance).
 Basically all VLANS are L2 transparent connected between both sides, giving me the same IP Address-space, WiFi-Networks, etc... over both locations.
 All inter-VLAN Routing takes place on the Core-Switch at HQ. Internet Connection is also only at HQ. Any connections to the internet from SB goes through HQ.
 In the event that the EtherLink goes down, Inter-VLAN routing at SB is not possible anymore. How can I make Inter-VLAN routing possible at the Core-Switch at SB in the case that the EtherLink to HQ goes down? Internet Connectivity is not a requirement in this case.
 €dit: I should mention that I&#x27;m using a HPE 10504 as the Core@HQ and a HPE FlexFabric 5940 as Core@SB. Other switches on both sides are all HPE. Mostly 5510 and 5130.

                              <span>So we have this one IP that&#x27;s being used for FiveM GTA V with an anti DDoS service. Each time the IP got attacked with DDoS (which got filtered by the anti DDoS service), we&#x27;d then receive abuse notice by email which says that the IP is doing a network scan / network attack to a lot of IPs which they listed in that email. It&#x27;s our IP that&#x27;s getting attacked by DDoS but why are we receiving that kind of email?

                              <span>Planning network config for a small company - setting up one office in the UK and one in India, will have 1-2 APs at each for now (max 5-6 users at each). No on-prem servers, everything in the cloud. 1 Gbps symmetric fiber at both sites.
 Easy management is key, as I will usually be thousands of miles away from either office (and overseeing IT is maybe 5% of my job) - so a single pane of glass for routers/FWs/APs would be great if possible.
 Somewhat budget conscious - would be great to avoid hefty subscription costs if possible.
 Among prosumer-ish stuff, I don&#x27;t trust Ubiquiti beyond their APs, and TP-Link Omada likely won&#x27;t be acceptable in this particular application.
 Thoughts on Engenius, which seems to have a single pane cloud solution with their ESG510 gateway + APs?
 Or I guess could give up the single pane and do, say, Aruba InstantOn for APs and something else for FWs (maybe Fortinet FortiGate 60F/70F?). Any other reasonable FW options?
 Any other ideas?

                              <span>I am a former DevOps guy, and bought some commercial real estate. Looking to setup wifi and network across a 25k SF multi-tenant building. Cinderblock walls that are concrete filled, so signal doesn&#x27;t travel well between units. Looking for suggestions on best &quot;cheap used enterprise&quot; hardware to look at. Don&#x27;t have much experience with Cisco, Aruba, Arista, etc. Read dozens of threads and can&#x27;t tell whats legit and what&#x27;s a Ford vs Chevy thing. Tried using 30 Google WiFi routers in topology described below and it failed horribly. Tenants are mom and pop so just needing basic wifi across the building plus extensive security system cause building is in the ghetto. 
 Cat6 to each unit from roof, forming wired backbone of one hard-wired AP per unit into 2-3 48 port POE switches. Add more wireless APs in each unit to form a hybrid mesh network without have to run more Cat6 everywhere. Wired backbone would also contain dozens of POE security cameras. Wired backbone would have a few switches spread geographically aross the building (left, right, center) and all connected by SPF uplinks.
 I want to avoid licensing fees and recurring costs. Ideally I can buy cheap enterprise hardware on ebay/offerup, link it all up, write a script or two for configuration (or click some buttons on a web portal) and be done. If need to expand, buy more of the same used gear then plug and play to expand the network. Don&#x27;t want to worry about getting bricked out because a vendor discontinues some cloud product or because my license expired or I didn&#x27;t buy from approved vendors. Also confused on the internal vs external wireless controller -- seems like sometimes thay is part of the AP and other times it is seperate?
 What brands/models do you all recommend and why? Give me a shopping list that can get it done as cheap, easy and robust as possible. I like the idea of buying used in bulk and then developing a scalable I can replicate on any future building I buy.

                              <span>In your opinion, does it make more sense to consolidate resources into separate resource groups based off resource type? Example:
 ​
 Databases - rg-databases
 Servers - rg-servers
 Linux - rg-linux
 Keyvaults - rg-keyvault
 NICs - rg-nics
 vnet - rg-virtualnetwork
 NSG - rg-nsg
 automation accounts - rg-automation
 ​
 Or would it make more sense to do something similar, but consolidate NSG, Vnet, etc into a rg such as rg-networking?
 ​
 Or combine resources that are used for each other, I.E a VM with a NIC, vnet, nsg, etc?
 ​
 Can you give me examples of how you do it?

                              <span>We are doing vendor evaluation for a 800K software solution. We are down to the last 3 vendors and are doing final technical evaluations and pricing negotiations.
 One vendor has some shady AF tactics by sending us depreciation notices for competitors, for products we&#x27;re even evaluating. There&#x27;s some other mud slinging shenanigans that are just underhanded and not professional.
 The second doesn&#x27;t meet several of our core criteria, so they&#x27;re already disqualified, but have the best price. 
 The third bone head is borderline harassing my staff calling and texting several times a day. We&#x27;re a slow decision making process because of the cost, and won&#x27;t let up. Then he drops the bombshell that he&#x27;s desperate to make the sale because he&#x27;ll lose his job if he doesn&#x27;t close with us.
 Now I&#x27;m left with an ethics problem that may disqualify this vendor. And the swarmy sales guy makes me want to ditch the first. Ugh... I don&#x27;t ever remember purchasing being this hard. 
 Now what do I do?

                              <span>I recently took on a small companies IT and to say the least it was a dumpster fire. They use intune which I&#x27;ve never used before and I don&#x27;t get the time or resources to properly test things before deploying them. Which of course has led to issues already. I&#x27;m trying to learn intune as best and as fast as I can but who knows how long that&#x27;ll take. I&#x27;ve never been solo before with this much responsibility. Do you have any advice on how to best approach this and deal with stress that comes from it?

 Comes out in the new release. I assume users will get spammed if not disabled. Could be annoying.

                              <span>I was trying to add 2fa to ssh in our oracle cloud server.
 And got locked out coz something didn&#x27;t work and I tried to ssh many times, thus making fail2ban kill my existing ssh connection.
 Thought I could just ask my friend who also has ssh access to the server, turns out he didn&#x27;t even setup an ssh-key even tho I told him to do so before I closed off password authentication.
 none of the oracle cloud control panel&#x27;s console shell or run command option were working for some reason
 I freakin make a recovery instance, detached the boot volume of the broken server, attached it to the recovery instance, fixed the config, and then re-attached the boot volume where it belonged
 It may not sound like much but I&#x27;m just 17 and have no professional courses or certificates when it comes to oracle cloud (or any other cloud) and sysadmin.
 I feel so confident on my sysadmin skills.
 After this I don&#x27;t feel like a kiddo when I say that I&#x27;m a decent sysadmin.

                              <span>Sorry for long post, I&#x27;m thinking about this for a week now, and I don&#x27;t have anyone to talk to.
 So here is a situation, after 3 years of different admins doing shit they didn&#x27;t document, it is my turn to have fun. I recently got promoted from help desk, because 2 admins left.
 And here comes the fun part.
 All Managers are in DA group. There is a Local Admin policy but it is linked to whole domain. Admin rights are given using restricted groups policy.
 My plan to fix this mess is to create 3 groups. Workstation admins, Developers, Server admins. Also 3 policies one to link to workstations OU, second also to workstations (but restrict it to apply only to developers Desktops) and third to server OU.
 I will create separate accounts for administration and add them to groups.
 Workstation admins will be 2 of our helpdesk guys, I will also give them righs to add PC to domain.
 Developers will be all Developers (don&#x27;t ask me why, they cry to the management if they don&#x27;t get admin rights. And they love them more since they make money)
 Server admins will be me, 1 colleague and CEO
 And I will leave only Domain Administrator in DA group and restrict access to all machines except Domain Controllers.
 First question is do you think that this plan is good? Do you have any other advice?
 Second question is, since a lot of members of DA group and Local Admin group are already logged in to some Workstations and Servers, and they won&#x27;t lose admin access on those machines untill I restart them. What is a best way to remove them without reboot, but also apply new policies?

                              <span>Seeing the other topic about emails reminded me of this happening last week. 
 User tells me an email to a government agency never made it there in time, and that it is going to cost us funding money. They want me to go look in the system and see if it ever left Exchange. They had sent it the week before, closed up shop and went on vacation.
 Check Exchange, and sure enough it did not go through on the day in question, but on the day they called me. So it looks like it didn&#x27;t leave the mailbox, went into outgoing, they prematurely closed up the machine before it sent and went home. I explain this to them, and they tell me that because they use a Mac, and heard the &quot;Swoosh&quot; sound, they knew it sent.
 Wrong. I have the proof that it didn&#x27;t send. Here&#x27;s the proof.
 Not good enough, they had me expand the parameters, check the system again, so I did. I humored them. It&#x27;s then that I notice that the email had a second recipient: The sender.
 &quot;Did you CC yourself in the email as well?&quot;
 &quot;Yes Mikash33, I did.&quot;
 &quot;I see. Did you receive the email before today?&quot;
 &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t.&quot;
 &quot;OK, so think about that for a moment; You sent this very important email to them and yourself, didn&#x27;t get your copy, and didn&#x27;t think to check if it sent until a week later?&quot;
 Silence on the phone. Checks watch, 10 seconds go by before I bust out: &quot;Is there anything else I can help you with today?&quot;

                              <span>I just started a new job (that I absolutely love so far) as a system admin. They don’t have a ticketing system. They want to use Salesforce as a ticketing system. Not the ticketing system that Salesforce has (Desk.com or whatever) but Salesforce itself. 
 If anyone has any experience with using Salesforce as a ticketing system, please tell me pros/cons and if you don’t, what ticketing system would you recommend?
 Edit: Further info, we already have Salesforce and a Salesforce Admin, who is the one that recommended Salesforce cases as our ticketing system.

                              <span>Interesting article about tech companies cutting benefits.
 I myself watched as the company I wrapped up my long career up with, a company with billion dollar annual profits, slowly but very steadily chip away at every benefit from healthcare to office conditions over the last several years. Looking back I was glad to have been there &quot;during the good times&quot; and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. 
 In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their &quot;thousand small cuts over time&quot; approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I&#x27;m not saying to Unionize (and I&#x27;m not saying not to, either), but it&#x27;s clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you&#x27;re quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.

                              <span>When configuring IE Mode in group policy, we configured the setting for &quot;in-Page&quot; navigation to open unconfigured site in IE Mode. Everything has been working fine for quite a while, however one of our apps is externally linking to Google Maps and that site no longer works in IE Mode. In MS technet, it states: 
 &quot; This policy gives you time to identify and configure all of the authentication servers used by your IE mode sites. &quot;
 Have any of you identifies all of the &quot;authentication servers&quot; in your environment? What is the level of difficulty and what tools did you use?

                              <span>To reduce the IT Overhead at our company, we are swapping everyone from Verizon to ATT.
 Verizon - $40/month
 ATT - $25/Month
 Both have unlimited text/call/data with data reducing speeds for individual if they go over 50GB/month.
 I have tried to call and negotiate with Verizon on dropping us down to match ATT, but they dont seem to be budging. Ive already swapped around 100 from Verizon. Still around 250 to go. Anyone have a similar experience or were you able to get more reasonable rates at Verizon?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;ve come across a problem with our D-Link DGS-3120-48TC switches. We have three stacked together and I had set one port to a VLAN (L2 Features -&gt; VLAN -&gt; 802.1Q VLAN Settings) and also enabled the guest VLAN on that port as well (Security -&gt; 802.1X -&gt; Guest VLAN Settings), so that a device that doesn&#x27;t get authenticated by 802.1X, it automatically gets put into the guest VLAN. 
 Now, I removed the guest VLAN setting and wanted to configure the same port to a new VLAN while also removing it from the first VLAN. This, however, shows the error &quot;The guest VLAN member port cannot be configured.&quot; This only happens when trying to assign it to VLAN 1. Every other VLAN works, but I need the PC attached in VLAN 1 x)
 Has anyone stumbled upon this as well and can lead me in the right direction?

 Is it possible to upload and share documents onto OneDrive using PowerShell? If so can someone guide me in the right direction. Or possibly provide a sample PowerShell script on how to do it. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think our network is infallible. Once in a while, sure, it&#x27;s something on our network! But I&#x27;ve been spending a ridiculous amount of time lately trying to prove to third party support that various issues are not &quot;network problems&quot;. It&#x27;s their default go-to and it&#x27;s pissing me off.
 These are examples that have taken a ridiculous amount of my time over just the past month:
  
New POS system at a remote location, network blamed for equipment going down for several days. Turns out to be a licensing renewal issue on their end. No apologies for their mistake. It ended up happening AGAIN at another location later.
 MDM system stops allowing certain IT staff to enroll mobile devices properly. &quot;Must be something you did on your end&quot; - ends up being a change they made on their end.
 SSO for a third-party app stops working randomly one night - &quot;Must be a network issue on your end&quot; - spend hours trying to troubleshoot and nothing our end changed, turns out to be a bad coding change on their end.
 Outlook add-in for large CRM stops working for certain employees, but not others. &quot;It&#x27;s your Outlook version&quot; - prove that it isn&#x27;t by having a user with access to all orgs try all in the same instance of Outlook. This is still a pending issue and can&#x27;t get them to accept responsibility.
  
I know I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here but I&#x27;m so sick of it. Wasting all kinds of time trying to prove to first level support dumbasses that read scripts all day to let me talk to someone who knows what the hell they&#x27;re talking about. Even escalating just leads to more dumbasses that won&#x27;t accept responsibility for issues.

                              <span>We have Adobe Reader on most of our systems because one of the main applications that we use here requires it. The only problem is the company that makes the software wants us to run very old versions of Adobe Reader because of compatibility with their product. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s laziness on their end but not being able to update our PDF software is a risk on our end. I know the normal response is usually get another vendor, but trust me when I tell you this is not an option.
 I&#x27;m worried about PDF attachments that come through email. I am really at a loss how to handle this. Keep AR at older versions but protect against email attachments. Just saying it makes me feel stupid. I know the answer is &quot;you want to keep a vulnerable version of AR but you want to security as well?&quot; I hear you. I&#x27;m just looking for possible solutions right now. How would you guys handle this email issue? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a cryptography expert, nor am I a sysadmin. But I&#x27;m playing around with PKI (mostly mostly client auth/sign), but I think a relatable example that most sysadmins will get is PKI use for S/MIME.
 Yes, you can pay $50/email address to some certificate authority, but many will also roll out their own PKI. It all depends on the use case of course, do you just need non-repudiation for internal use, or do you want outside recipients to verify emails.
 But it&#x27;s 2023. Let&#x27;s Encrypt lets you get DV certificates for free, but those certificates only support TLS server/client authentication EKUs.
 Why can&#x27;t we have free validated S/MIME certificates (and other types of certificates)?
 Why can&#x27;t we have our own CA for a domain, and have our &quot;local root&quot; signed by a &quot;real&quot; CA just like any other intermediate CA, so we can generate our own certificates that work on our own domains? Servers would need to also serve intermediate certificates that are under our control so the chain can be fully built since those links are missing in browser/computer root stores, but that&#x27;s just a few extra bytes.

                              <span>A client has 3 licenses of a software which are shared on 5 computers. According to the license it is ok to share those licenses (up to 2 users per each license), however cannot be used simultaneously.
 Obviously the users forget to close the software one they are finished and just leave it running in the background, thus blocking others who need to launch it on their computers.
 Is there a way to detect when a process has been idle for more than 15 minutes, so that we can then run a command to kill the process from memory?
 I tried using PowerShell but it seems that there is no property which gives how long the process has been idle.
 Maybe someone out there knows of a software that can reliably monitor a specified process for this type of scenario.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So we recently had a major problem with an DPM server going down (We suspect an windows update gone corrupt) 
 Now the server is semi stable and it never freezes or crashes HOWEVER now the DPM just outright stops at random I&#x27;ve checked the eventlog which pointed me towards REFS.
 The errors we are getting before it hangs is: ID 129 - vhdmp and ID 51 - disk
 We have implemented the REFS fixes that Microsoft recommends to no avail.
 Nothing have been changed on the server since this error started to occur (it have been running for approx. 3 months)
 Some info about the server: Windows Server 2022 - updated to latest Microsoft SQL 2022 - updated to latest DPM 2022 - updated to latest.
 The DPM disk is 40TB and is running through Think system raid 9350 card.
 Anyone that can point me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hi
 I am putting a bunch of new desktop computers into a laboratory where noise must be kept to a minimum. Because of this, the computers live in a separate room from the monitors and keyboards which must be connected over CAT 6 cables in the walls.
 Does anyone know of a reliable (and hopefully affordable) brand of adapters which can take the USB (keyboard and mouse) and Displayport (monitors) connections and put them onto the CAT6 cables?

                              <span>Hi All
 We have come across this weird issue auto signing into Edge default profile . Currently we deploy devices using on premise MDT. When a device joins the domain, it checks in with Group Policy and applies the following user GPs
 • Force users to sign-in to use the browser
 • Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account
 • Force synchronization of browser data and do not show the sync consent prompt
 • Hide the First-run experience and splash screen
 This works great and Edge signs in perfectly. 
 We are 99% setup now with Intune – albeit hybrid – I know the consensus on this is not ideal, but we have it working perfectly with AOVPN and bar a few hacky things, its works reliably. The same GPs are in play, Same OUs and …</span>

                              <span>This might seem very odd. But my isp is telling me that a ping of 240ms+ (some times up to 320) between servers here (Melbourne Australia) and servers in New York (Ithica) is &quot;normal&quot; the time jump when doing a trace rout from NY only jumps from like 12ms to 240ms when it hits the backbone routers in Indonesia before like 4 more hops to our servers here. 
 Does this in fact seem &quot;normal&quot; ... or am I loosing my brain ? Having issues with apps timing out because of this... ISP is trying to tell me that sort of ping time is &quot;normal&quot; .. Ill shut up if it is.. just means I&#x27;m going to have to do a deep dive to fig out why things are now timing out between these two points when they have been running fine for years...

                              <span>so we got a few (I think 10) Teams licenses as part of our Legacy Silver partnership with M$ in 2021 and they expired this week. I understand that now if we want to continue to use it, we need to purchase the license, this is fine. But it looks like this type of license cannot be renewed for the same email address, it requires me to create new profile and my past conversations/history get (apparently) lost. Ever happened to any of you? What am I doing wrong?
 Is there a way to download conversation history from Teams if my license expired?

                              <span>SMB with 2 ISPs currently for redundancy and throughput (Xfinity and ATT Fiber) 1gig/1gig and 1gig/35mbps.
 Currently have a garbage Peplink Balance 20. Maxes at 150-200mbps throughput and really HIGH latency.
 Have about 15-20 users concurrently (up to 100 devices), all network traffic is mainly CRM/ERP software which is all web based and 15 or so VOIP Phones.
 Debating between Netsense, Fortinet, Cisco, etc. Want DUAL WAN capability with load balancing.
 Fortinet 60f or 80F is what I&#x27;ve been leaning more towards. What are you thoughts? Price is a main concern for owners, but quality is most important in terms of up time. This will be self administered and i&#x27;m a techy guy but we&#x27;re not doing anything fancy on the network.
 Just lots of traffic of all kinds, nothing huge data file wise, just mainly lost of secure web traffic for our cloud hosted CRM/ERP/ETC.
 Will need to add about 4-6 Wireless AP&#x27;s throughout the building so also something that has a Wireless AP solution would be great.

                              <span>Hey guys
 I have a strange behavior with a system I added to my Windows Server Hyper-V Failover Cluster in Server 2022.
 The servers have nearly the same configuration - the CPUs are a Intel Xeon Gold and Intel Xeon Silver:
 Cluster with Server 1 and Server 2 (the new Server).
 Behavior not working:
  
VM is on Server1 and I want to Live Migrate to Server 2
 not working, because of &quot;processor specific features&quot; - but the CPU compatibility mode from the VM is activated
  
Behavior working:
  
If I shutdown the VM and do a fast failover from Server 1 to Server 2 it&#x27;s working and I can start and work with the VM
 
If I do then a failover from Server 2 to Server 1 it&#x27;s working
 
A switch back from Server 1 to Server 2 is working as well
 
When the VM is on Server 2 I can restart and shutdown the VM and after starting again I&#x27;m able to live migrate to Server 1
 
 At this point it&#x27;s not working anymore:
  
When I shutdown or restart the VM on Server 1, I&#x27;m not able to do a failover to Server 2 (see behavior not working - processor specific features)
  
Server1 and Server2 have the same Hyper-V Manager settings and I already tried with a new, from scratch, installed Windows VM.
 Where is the difference? Why is the normal failover working as long as the machine is moved in shutdown state and failovered while it&#x27;s running until it&#x27;s shutdown/restart on a different server (Server 1).
 I found something about Bios/Driver differences but since both servers are not equal, I have differences.

                              <span>So I had to replicate across an Exchange on-prem DDL during a migration and needed to recreate it in Exchange Online. Previously it just added everyone in the recipient container but obviously that won&#x27;t work in Exchange Online.
 It just checks the &quot;Company Name&quot; and adds users to the group if they match. However we have some managers that also need to be added that have a different company name. Is there any way I can do this?

                              <span>Currently looking for a new backup solution and looks like the leading two are Rubrik and Commvault. We use a mix of VMware and Nutanix AHV which means Cohesity is out of the mix due to lack of full support for AHV. Due to funding any cloud-based DRAAS such as Commvault&#x27;s metallic is also not going to be considered.
 We already have Veeam so we know what that offers.
 Large Hospital and have about 1000 VMs with 150 Physical - more to be onboarded soon. Need on-site and cloud storage for backup copies.
 Has anyone used both Rubrik and Commvault? What do you recommend? I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re both great products but Commvault is a lot more complicated to set up and manage.

                              <span>I am on site doing a server replacement 3k miles from our home office. Went to swap the server our latest servers are these fanlesa custom unites that are low profile and all solid state, the have a pci e x4 slot with the back cut off of it but no way to mount a card at all as the chassis will not allow. The situation is that the client has a piece of software that is mission critical to be online from 10am-10pm, and the license key is currently a parallel key that is plugged into a parallel pci card in their current system. I only have a few days on site and need to find a workaround, I have that pcie x4 slot and USB basically are my only options to figure something out. Our newer stuff uses USB license keys and we can convert this one but it wouldn&#x27;t get done fast enough. Lastly I am in Anaheim so I have access to all of Anaheim and LA which may help my odds finding some adapter card or something locally thanks everyone.

                              <span>We have dozens of Windows 10 Enterprise laptops, all enrolled in Azure AD + Intune, that we want to wipe remotely with the script/app.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has tested a method to perform a remote wipe, as we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on the issue and have had little luck.
 We&#x27;ve been using Graph API calls, like the one below, experimenting with different commands and payloads. For 90% of our test cases, we&#x27;ve had the same result: the system is partially wiped, with most of the data left on the device, and after reboots, the user is presented with a login to the Admin account, not OOBE.
 We&#x27;ve tried many variations of the API call and have even checked the API calls from the Intune portal using dev tools, but all our efforts have produced the same, unsatisfactory result. Our problem seems to apply only to Windows 10 devices. A few tested Windows 11 devices were wiped successfully.
 calls used: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices/XXXXXX/cleanWindowsDevice or /Wipe with different payloads etc. Also non-beta calls fails.

                              <span>Hey,
 SME here. MS365. Only work-from-home. No vpn. No centralized hardware.
 I have an individual user that has continuously corrupted pst-files on his W11 device. Were others don&#x27;t have (or most exceptionally have) this issue.
 After extensive trial &amp; error, I&#x27;m starting to suspect intermittent internetconnection.Speedtest is pretty fast, ping is ok, but when in teams-meeting we have also experienced small hickups and even disconnects. So I&#x27;m thinking her wired connection is kind of bad quality, drops the connection, hence device goes over to wifi, and back, and back, and back. Resulting in Outlook to start flipping.
 Any particular application where I can the user have to run a log for a few days and see what&#x27;s happening on her machine?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I already made my first post with a question about MS Defender for Endpoint about a month ago, since I have to do a little Presentation about it. 
 I am facing a new problem, which I can&#x27;t solve on my own (at least it looks like that). But now to my problem: 
 I want to know each possible column which I can get on Vuln. like CVE-ID, Description and so on. I was able to open a trial account with my student email and it works fine for MS Defender for Endpoint and Intune, but I can&#x27;t get access with the same acc to PowerBi and to Azure. I used an other Account to get Azure (and tried to set up some test vm´s), but I am not able to onboard them into MS Defender for VM. 
 What do I need ? 
 I got a report example about some Vuln. which I can&#x27;t reproduce with just using MS Endpoint and MS for Cloud and I would need a report with a few different (test) vulnerabilities, that are active, closed or in remediation with ALL possible columns. I tried every report feature in the application itself and I would like to know if there are more columns possible if I for example use the PowerBi Interface ? Its really hard, since the Documentation is not really precise in a lot of things like states etc.
 Sorry for my not very accurate English ... and also, if I did not understand sth. right - I am new in this field and not very experienced. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys, just looking into an issue a client noticed on their RD environment and I cannot figure out what&#x27;s happened.
 Basically 1 user has taken up 3 of the RD licenses (CAL&#x27;s) If you open RD licensing manager you can see the licenses active on an individual user bases, but then 1 user has 3 assigned to himself. The only thing that stands out as odd to me is it shows slightly different uppercase/lowercase characters for each of the entry&#x27;s. for example:
 CompanyDomain\joe.blogs - Issued on 18th may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.Blogs - Issued on 15 may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.blogs - Issued on 03 may 2023 - Active
 Notice each entry has different capital letters. this is a replica of how it shows in RD Licensing manager 
 1st entry has no capitals
 2nd entry has capitals on both names
 3rd entry has 1 capital on the first name and all lowercase second name. 
 They have 20 licenses in total, all active but 3 are assigned to this 1 guy
 user is only logged into 1 server at the moment of 3 RDS servers. RDBroker shows this is also the case.
 I can see in our RMM system they have more than 1 workstation. PC in office and laptop for remote working. Is it possible they&#x27;ve been given multiple licenses because they may have connected in from multiple workstations at some point? doesn&#x27;t explain why he&#x27;s got 3 when he only has 2 workstations if that were the case.

                              <span>Evening
 Just wanted to hear from anyone with a similar experience. Was handed a laptop with my new role last October to which it&#x27;s a 7 year old lenovo with Windows home. November last year even after an SSD and ram upgrade to 8GB (from 4) still struggling with cpu. I&#x27;ve had to turn off noise filtering a little while ago in teams to make it usable during long meetings. I have an email trail since November asking for a new laptop screen and dock stating the reasons and its been stalled ever since, every meeting catchup with manager there&#x27;s a different excuse or blame on the further delayed merger talks. Latest is I&#x27;ve got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can&#x27;t switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I&#x27;m at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow. Today&#x27;s advice from manager was to create a work profile on my personal laptop, as we all need to make personal sacrifices. Kind on makes me think I should go back to an MSP, respected in my last few. Maybe I should invoice them for use of my laptop?

                              <span>As a contractor I&#x27;ve worked with multi vendors over the last 12 years, but it&#x27;s always been one or two at a time. The last few years I&#x27;ve been working with sd-wan, firewalls, cloud, automation and traditional networking.
 It&#x27;s overwhelming to say the least, so many areas I need to have a good solid understanding of and find it hard to keep up with them all, not to mention the variety of vendors now.
 It&#x27;s really difficult to know what to focus on as it&#x27;s such a variety for network engineers these days.
 Does anyone else struggle with this? It&#x27;s great having the exposure but it&#x27;s all a bit too much also

                              <span>Imagine a situation where one is setting up a small network. There is to be some sort of physical server on the network with a VM running a webserver or mailserver or something that is exposed to the WAN. Obviously one should set up a firewall in this case. The physical server still has much memory and CPU time which is unused.
 As far is security is concerned, which one is better: using a dedicated physical firewall machine or adding a software-defined virtal firewall? Which is standard practice? In general, are security-oriented network services best kept physical for more guaranteed compartmentalization or best integrated into the SDN for simplicity (or something else)?

                              <span>Probably a stupid question but has anyone got experience importing hosts into the address space on an SRX with a CSV? I downloaded the example, updated it with my names, the host type and IPV4 IP addresses.
 Imported with no errors. When I search for the name or IP using the search tool, it returns no entries. If I try to then manually add the name or IP, it errors telling me it exists already. If I try to add the name to an existing group object - it is not available to select. 
 I delete the entry and can manually add the Name and IP and everything works fine. CSV import would be great for 50 and 60 new names and IP&#x27;s rather than the manual GUI host by host.

 Anything else I should pay special attention if I want to build a basic configuration for a new site?

                              <span>Technology stack for quick reference, it is an industrial network environment:
 Serial Network (20 Modbus slaves daisy-chained on RS-485) &gt; Modbus RTU to TCP Converter (Port 502, static IP assignment) &gt; Unmanaged OT Network Switch, /23 subnet with about 200 devices total, mostly Gigabit uplinks.
 After several years of happy and uninterrupted operation (it is a Datacenter), the Serial devices being Mastered by the converter had lost communications all at the same time. Initially, a soft reset of the device had re-established serial as well as TCP communications.
 Within hours, all of the serial devices lost communications again. Several different configuration changes were tried to no affect. A TCP/RTU testing utility was unsuccessful in establishing communications to the slaves via the Converter (failed on handshake), but the Web UI for the converters was still accessible. Soft reset did not help this time.
 Ended up changing the statically assigned IP configured on the Converter to a different address, same port (502), on the same subnet. Comms started working, everything stabilized.
 It is still working but I don&#x27;t understand why.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am working with a customer and am having an issue where devices are requiring a reboot in order to register back online intermittently. The devices are PoE + and require 30Watts to each one but that does not appear to be the problem as the customer sent back information that leads me to believe that cant be the issues (switches are definitely not overloaded). Below is the switch info along with the commands they are pushing to each port for the device before we install them.
 Cisco enterprise 3850 switches
 description **PA System**
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport mode access
 no logging event link-status
 no snmp trap link-status
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 I am by no means a network guy but could a standard QoS setting be causing a problem here? These are PA notification devices so they need to be set up to take priority over any other devices on the network incase of emergency. Could there be some kind of shut down due to inactivity possibly? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>So there are two buildings. Instead of paying for internet for both buildings we use a wireless bridge from one building to the other. I need to access a HA server I have setup down there. So the way it is all set up is:
 ISP &gt; Eero Mesh Network &gt; Wireless Bridge
  
Another Eero Mesh Network &gt; HA server.
  
Do you have any suggestions on how to access the the HA server from the first Eero network? The wireless bridge doesn&#x27;t seem to share the LAN or have any port forwarding options in the web interface.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve a 4 mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ setup, configured as two pairs of switches.
 Each pair has MLAG configured between them and hardware nodes are connected to one port in each via LACP. This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.
 My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.
 Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.
 Is this normal? I&#x27;ve not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I&#x27;d generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.

                              <span>We the network engineers manually replace the batteries and units ourselves and have for the last 20 years. It&#x27;s one of the least enjoyable parts of the job.
 Anyone use a ups vendor that&#x27;s reliable at all? We&#x27;d pretty much just want to be hands off when it comes to battery backup units. Vendor comes into the closets to replace the batteries or full units when needed or reach end of life.

 What would be the bet enterprise grade Dual WAN Routers that are easy to administer and don&#x27;t have all the fancy functions? We have very basic network and security needs, and really don&#x27;t store any data onsite. Everything is in Vendor Cloud&#x27;s.
 Will also need to deploy wireless AP&#x27;s so something that talks to eachother for setup and administration would be great.
 Price sensitive. Would be deploying 4-6 AP&#x27;s throughout the building, indoors.

When looking around for reading materials I&#x27;ve found &quot;Cisco ISP Essentials&quot; Barry Raveendran Greene and Philip Smith, but this was written over 20 years ago. Is there anything more recent that you might recommend? I get the feeling the only other material out there stuff for the Cisco NP/IE SP track? (Which I&#x27;m also looking into, but I&#x27;m just curious if there was other resources in addition to that)

I wondered if there are any similar network simulation quizzes out there for learning purposes? Preferable free, but i dont mind paying for it. The ones i found and where free to test are all like questionaires. But i would like to have this simulation style.

                              <span>Last week a department put in an incident saying an email was not delivered and because of that it cost the company a substantial amount of money and they are saying the email system messed up. The email SME did his research- it was Exchange- no external email. Someone internally email an attachment to a DL and none of those people in the DL claimed they received it, but mail flow and Exchange Reporter said they did. We were able to show who sent the message and when it was received by all the people in the DL which are internal as well.
 Fast forward to today and that department is sticking to it’s guns that the company email system messed up and the email just “disappeared”
 Really?! FFS are users this dumb? Not one but FOUR in the DL? What more do you want I thought? I was told by my leadership to find hard proof the message was there. So I did.
 I gave my adm account access to the mailboxes and logged into each one and found the message. The person causing the most stink- I found the message in their recover deleted items and it had been deleted four minutes after it was received.
 Now the department is blaming us because the file doesn’t have the right content- sorry that is not even remotely the IT department’s responsibility- please find another way to spin it how you f**ked up and don’t blame IT!

                              <span>One of the clients we work with is going out of business, they are shutting down the tenant and getting rid off the domain; they are closing for good. All users have M365 E3 license and all computers are correctly enrolled in Intune via AutoPilot and AzureAD Joined. The owner of the company would like to donate all company owned laptops, so I need to remove them from AutoPilot and Intune. 
 How can I remove around 100 Windows 10 devices from the Microsoft 365 tenant? Keep in mind that all computers have BitLocker enabled via Intune Policy so I need an option that will not trigger BitLocker.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>TLDR: is there a setting for RDP that would cause a session reset if a file or type of file is copied through the session?
 Like to read see below: For some specific reason we use this, I am new~ish to the team so don’t roast me just yet, but I have been getting complaints from day 3 that this process fails. When asked if it ever worked I get a “yea?”. It’s happening across multiple different systems across multiple networks. The only constant is windows 10 is the OS connecting to the servers rdp session. All the windows 10 are a base image to a bunch of vdi pools, the servers are scattered across networks and these vdi are used to manage it all. The user can have admin access to one or both side and get this. It seems to be 99% of users, like 1 person can get it to work and it’s pissing his peers off. 
 Work flow User pc&gt;vdi&gt;rdp 
 Any direction would be appreciated I thought I knew terminal server until now!

                              <span>We got our first ever IT intern. We are looking for some things to help him learn, outside of shadowing and doing some easier tasks. He&#x27;s very green, still in college. He has some programming and database experience from school. We have decided it probably wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to throw him on helpdesk as it would take just as long as the internship lasts to get him up to speed. Not saying he won&#x27;t do troubleshooting, just not the entire time. 
 If you were an intern, what are some things you wished you had picked up in the sysadmin field that maybe you didn&#x27;t during your internship. 
 Appreciate the feedback!

 If I try to start it with powershell I get an error related to permissions:
 PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; start-vm PTIDPAPRDAP1 start-vm : &#x27;PTIDPAPRDAP1&#x27; failed to start.

 Happens to any vm at any host. Any idea on what might be happening?
 Edit: will try to reinstall one host and bring the vm&#x27;s up there.

                              <span>We have LAPS setup and configured, but we’re having a disagreement internally about how to best retrieve the password. If we’re trying to avoid using privileged domain creds on a desktop, what’s the most secure way for a tech to retrieve the password? Whether we launch ADUC or use a Powershell script from the tech’s local desktop, we still need to auth to the domain.
 LAPS solves the local credential cache issue, but if the machine is compromised in some way (keylogger etc) then elevating to the domain to retrieve the password still potentially exposes these accounts.
 How are you all dealing with this? Not allowing techs to elevate from their local machines and using an isolated bastion host instead?

                              <span>At my org the usual way of a ticket is as followed: 1. User calls the servicedesk, who in the best case solves the issue right away. 2. If servicedesk can&#x27;t solve it, the ticket is assigned to the responsible department (Applications, End-devices &amp; support, Infrastructure) 3. If support can&#x27;t solve it, the ticket is assigned to either applications or infrastructure. 
 This morning I pulled a queued ticket that support wasn&#x27;t able to solve. My colleague in the support department mentioned that he performed several checks on the users client. When I phoned the user, I casually chatted about the actions my colleague supposedly took. The user didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about. He said that noone from IT contacted her this day so I was a little curious.
 After the call I mailed my colleague …</span>

 Part-time Employee
 Remote Employee
 Chief Information Security Officer
 Network Admin
 System Admin
 Full-time Employee
 Temporary Employee
 Manager/Team Lead
 I said only the network admin and system admin should receive privileged accounts and I got it wrong because the CISO should have also received privileged roles. I&#x27;ve worked at a number of companies and not once has a Chief anything Officer received any sort of admin permissions; they only dictate policy, budgets, etc.
 What are your opinions on this? Do the executives at your companies perform admin duties?

 We have road warriors who will need a softphone.
 We have salespeople who need BYOD cellphone integration.
 We have desk jockeys who will need a hardware phone.
 We have Call centers that need reporting.
 We need to record every single call, all the time, and keep them for seven years. (regulatory requirement).

                              <span>Hello,
 Windows server 2016 running under VMWare esxi6.7U3.
 I am using VMFS6
 I want to add approximately 50-60TB single disk size to this server.
 My questions are :
 1- I’m wondering what is your strategies/tricks about backuping a large vm (many TB+)? Anybody have any experience backing up a virtual machine of that size.
 2- I will use NTFS File system. What do you recommended as Cluster Size ?
 3- If I use a large size disk, what are the disadvantages?
 thanks,

                              <span>In our shop I have been ordering the cheapest GPU for our Dell OptiPlex orders. I have been under the impression this would help the computer to offload some of work of running two monitors. These are just desktops for staff and students. 
 At this point, are the two included/onboard DisplayPort ports enough to run two monitors and I can stop ordering desktops with the GPU and save the money?

                              <span>Hi, we have enabled Azure Rights Management a few weeks ago, but from higher up they would like to get rid of the labels Confidential \ All Company and Highly Confidential \ Al Company. I found where I can access these labels, but they are greyed out under Azure Information Protection. What we also noticed is that in the Outlook Preview the two labels don&#x27;t exist. However this will take a good few months before this version will even be rolled out. Can anyone provide me with some support on how to get rid of the two labels in question? Thanks in advance

 I have tried disable/ enable syncing in the settings as recommended everywhere. Also tried removing the profile and re adding but nothing works. When I resync in the settings, it does say setting up sync then goes back to the can&#x27;t sync error.
 Anyone come across this before?? I ha e about another 20 users all running ok with same setup.

                              <span>I just enrolled my personal device to test Android device management in Intune. I added some apps from the Managed Google Play Store. I made some required, and some available. The required ones were installed, but when I open the Google Play Store for Work nothing shows in the list of available apps.
 The apps were all made available to &quot;All Users.&quot; Some I made available for enrolled devices, some I made available with or without enrollment, just to see if that made a difference. Still, nothing is showing as available.
 Also, what&#x27;s the difference between &quot;Available for enrolled devices&quot; and &quot;Available with or without enrollment?&quot; How would someone access the available apps if their device isn&#x27;t enrolled?

                              <span>Interesting issue. I have a .scr script that is in the same location. (Sits on a NAS). Two RHEL computers try to run this script. Same location same attributes because it is the SAME file in the same shared location.
 One computer executes it fine. The other says &quot;unable to execute&quot; (even as root)
 I have check the fstab file and the mount is the same. Both do not have firewall enabled. What is blocking one computer from executing scripts? Is there a place to check if the overall file system has a noexec? Because looking at both computers theirs are similar.

 Should you disclose this? I did hear how unemployed people struggle to get jobs. I have not updated my resume or LinkedIn with this yet.
 Would they find out during a background check?
 If they ask when you can start, what should you say?

                              <span>We wanted to switch from VNC to RDP for remote support and administration. I need to connect to the systems over the internet. At the moment I use the UltraVNC Repeater software which works great. Do you know any software like the UltraVNC Repeater for RDP and have you any experience with it?
 Thank you in advance!

 They have same settings on the switch, same VLANS, 
 Old server has only one NIC and new HP has 2 NICs in TEAM - tried separated as well.
 ​
 Do you have any ideas where to start to look?
 tried:
 - Cables
 - doblechecked Switch config
 - Windows logs
 - Performance - load is low - 90%+ resources free

                              <span>Greetings all!
 We have a b2b direct connect setup with another tenant (both sides), and until recently it worked fine, we could create shared channels and upload files there and sync those files to devices using the sync option.
 But since a few days ago (maybe even before, not a lot of people use this option and edit the files online) users from the other tenant (and ours on their shared channels) started having issues with syncing files from a shared teams channel to their pc.
 They can access and work on the files in the browser or through teams, but can&#x27;t sync the files to their pc, they either get an error that says: &quot;sorry onedrive can&#x27;t add your folder right now, you might not have permissions to this folder, or it may belong to another organization&quot;, or when they click sync (either from teams or from the sharepoint site it self, it doesn&#x27;t matter) it starts the onedrive app, flashes a blank window and closes the window, and nothing happens.
 What is the issue here? we didn&#x27;t change anything on the tenant or shared channel setup, it just stopped working. We tried it from both sides and its the same issue. Did the direct connect mess up somehow? is it a onedrive app issue? We tried all the usual stuff like reinstalling the onedrive app to the latest version, cleaning the cache, even new installs of windows, we tried different users and new/old groups/channels. I&#x27;ve opened a support ticket with microsoft, but thought someone here maybe had the same issue and managed to sort it?
 Any advice would be extremely helpful!
 (also sorry if i opened this topic in the wrong reddit site, feel free to point me in the right direction :D)

 Also, when I try to import IIS 6.2 settings from 2012 to the IIS 2019 server using Shared Config the sites goes away and I dont see anything after reopening IIS. I checked the Management and WPSVC services and they were running. 
 TIA.

 For some reason, registry settings I configure on a Windows 10 PC are repeatedly restored by default. To be specific, the parameters we configure are AutoAdminLogon and the credentials for the user. The goal is to have a local account automatically login upon reboot of the computer. However, these settings keeps getting cleared by themselves. I&#x27;ve been looking at GPOs but can not find anything there. 
 Can someone provide some advice for troubleshooting?

 Have you ever achieved installing quick assist on Windows Server 2019? We’ve managed to install it yet it won’t launch..

                              <span>Hey guys, not sure if this is the right place to post this but I&#x27;ve seen a lot of Zebra printer related content here so giving it a shot.
 The goal: Print black labels with white text using my Zebra GX430t.
 The problem: I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to do this using Zebra Designer 3 free version. The solution using Zebra Designer 2 is not very good.
 The details:
 I have a Zebra GX430t with 76x127mm direct thermal labels. I am able to print perfectly well using the Zebra Designer 3 software by adding black text, objects etc. These print absolutely fine. What I want to do is to print exactly the same kinds of labels but with white text on black background rather than black text on white background. The labels will be used for presentation purposes on a black product so they need to match grap…</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 We&#x27;ve been using Gravityzone endpoint for the past month now. A common alert we see on reports are PST trojan alerts. The trouble is it occasionally deletes the users entire PST file, and of course most don&#x27;t know how to check their quarantine despite being shown how to many times...
 Is it worth turning off scanning of email archives? I only use webmail myself, and most of the spam filtering should be done by Google first before arriving in Outlook, so I doubt this is a feature our users will need.

                              <span>Hey all,
 If you&#x27;re managing a large number of Azure-joined devices, you&#x27;re probably well aware that manually enrolling each one into Intune can be quite time-consuming. To streamline this process, I&#x27;ve put together a PowerShell script that automates it.
 Here&#x27;s an overview of the script&#x27;s functions:
 Creates an MDM Key: The script generates an MDM key if it doesn&#x27;t already exist.
 Enables Automatic MDM Enrollment: It sets up automatic MDM enrollment using Azure AD credentials.
 Generates Necessary Registry Keys: These keys are essential for the enrollment process.
 Initiates Group Policy Update: It forces a group policy update using the gpupdate /force command.
 Defines Enrollment URLs: The script assigns the required MDM enrollment URLs.
 Automates Device Enrollment: It calls upon deviceenroller.exe to automatically enroll the device in MDM.
 You can find the full script here: https://github.com/fKryptek/Intune/blob/main/EnrollToIntune.ps1
 As with any script you find online, I highly recommend reviewing it, tailoring it to your needs, and testing it within a controlled environment before deploying it on a larger scale.
 I&#x27;m interested in hearing about your experiences with the script, as well as any modifications or improvements you might suggest. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please let me know.
 Looking forward to your feedback.
 If you&#x27;d like to buy me a coffee for my efforts : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bobbyhalford
 P.S.: Keep in mind, the effectiveness of this script may vary based on your Azure AD and Intune setup. Always customize and test in your own environment.

                              <span>Hi all, I have a weird issue, it seems some patch CU or other mitigation for Exchange 2016 has made a change to the SELF security on its computer object in Active Directory.
 The issue we have is SELF does not have rights to read or “write to personal information “ Which stops the correct enrolment of MDE as it needs to write a certificate to the personal store on the server. 
 Anyone else have this issue or would mind checking perms on their computer account object see if the default view has more than “change password” and “special”
 I want to change the perms but don’t want to bork the server. 
 My lab server has has normal permissions to SELF such as “Create All Child Objects” “Delete all child objects” “validate write to DNS host name” “read personal information “ “write personal information” “special”
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks.

 I used Dmarcian ( https://dmarcian.com/domain-checker/ ) and a few other checkers and it said my domain is valid. I believe Dmarcian is correct and Google Admin Toolbox is wrong. Check for yourself with any random domain. Anyone know what is wrong with Google Admin Toolbox?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Picked up a new envornment in the last 6 months and trying to understand why we have a fair amount of CPU resource avaiable, but still high CPU ready times in our Preprod resource pool. I THINK it&#x27;s due to how our resource pools are configured but not 100% sure.
 We have 2 resource pools: Prod and Preprod.
 Screenshots on how they&#x27;re setup: https://imgur.com/a/k62Po8S
 What I THINK is going on: 
 Although we have &quot;enough&quot; CPU resources within the cluster, because preprod is set to low, it&#x27;ll never be able to contend with prod.
 However, if I set Prod to High, and Preprod to Normal.. I&#x27;ll still have a 1:2 ratio of 4000 to 8000..
 So I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;ll solve my problem?
 I&#x27;m also not sure if I should set a CPU reservation / limit closer to what the actual usage is?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to share an HP LaserJet Pro M201n printer on a network with limited success. When I go to the &quot;add printer&quot; button under settings it shows me the name of the printer, but when I try to go ahead with it brings Error 283. Both computers are running Windows 10 enterprise and both have the printer drivers installed locally.

                              <span>Hey guys, got a quick question here. I added a Weblink as an App in Intune and on a Surface I can see it in the Portal App and install it through there. But for the mobile devices (Android and iOS) the link just doesn&#x27;t show up. I selected &quot;yes&quot; for show this as a featured app in the company portal, but on the phones it doesn&#x27;t appear. Any ideas why? I assigned it to our MDM group as available for enrolled devices. What the hell am I missing? Thanks in advance and if you need more information, just ask.

 Not sure if it is the cause, but I am getting error 2004 and warning 2212 from the event viewer. 
 The replication no longer resume. I tired all the methods I can find online but none of them works.
 Hope someone can shed a light. 
 TIA.

 With all of the SaaS systems, other integrations, links and what not it is hard to keep track on what is connected to what.
 Is there anyone who knows a good software or service to keep records of the made connections?
 I would like to have some sort of dashboard/view that can show me what is connected to lets say azure or even to the local AD, it doesn&#x27;t have to generate it automatically, i can add it any time i implement a connection, link or service.

 In a brand new infrastructure and having all resources you want, would you go for ADD exclusively or would you mix it up with on prem? And why?

 Because I try to run Windows command:
 Dism /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor 
 It&#x27;s showing the error message about it&#x27;s required dependency features from Microsoft-Hyper-V
 If I run Windows command:
 Dism /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V 
 It installed all Hyper-V Hypervisor features successfully.
 However, I want to install Hyper-V Hypervisor feature only and if I enabled via GUI it also installed Hyper-V Hypervisor successfully.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been using Lansweeper for 5 years now, apart from the Helpdesk lacking many features and possibilitys and the mail notifications being a bit unreliable, it did it&#x27;s job for a relatively low price. Asset Management was also not the greatest, but it was on Premise and again, did it&#x27;s job &quot;good enough&quot;. Deployments were always a bit messy. 
 With the recent changes Lansweeper made to their licensing structure, we are definately not going to pay premium for a Cloud Solution that doesn&#x27;t do much better in the other reagards. 
 So basically: Are there any alternatives? 
 Price doesn&#x27;t play that much of a role anymore, things have changed considerably and the IT-Budget got a pretty heavy bump (although it&#x27;s still not absolutely massive and we are still only 4 people in the Team, so it has to be something that&#x27;s relatively easy to learn...)
 Main point is: It has to be On-Prem. ITAM with connected Helpdesk would be something very nice as well. All i have found was ManageEngine, but i&#x27;ve not found any user stories about it :D 
 Any help would be appriciented - thanks! :)

                              <span>Hey sorry if this is a dumb question, still learning and the previous posts on the topic seem a little outdated (8+ years old).
 I&#x27;m having trouble understanding the benefits of SFTP over something like transfer via HTTPS to an s3 bucket. With s3 we can have multipart file transfers up to 5TB over TLS 1.2/3, and manage auth with iam + sigv4.
 I&#x27;m wondering what benefits SFTP provides/why is it used today other than historical/legal reasons. Is SSH more secure than TLS 1.3? Is ssh based file transfer faster?
 Again, sorry if this is dumb,
 Thanks

                              <span>Say your organization is multi-cloud, or in a single cloud provider with considerations to go multi-cloud.
 What are your present day criteria to determine where you&#x27;ll place a new workload? For example:
  
Which cloud provider and which region? What are the metrics or drivers that will motivate you to consider more than one provider? Or a new region within the same provider?
 Is the proverbial &quot;we always want the cheapest&quot; criterion still dominant in your decision-making strategy?
 What will deter you from using a pre-existing region or a cloud provider, other than survivability and site reliability? Is it capacity or bandwidth, or could it be latency?
 Other than the age-old &quot;proximity to the edge&quot; or &quot;proximity to the end users&quot; that were dominant factors a few years ago, are there new emerging considerations that you&#x27;re applying lately when deciding where to put a new sizable footprint?
  
I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll think about greenfield (brand new project, no restrictions) vs brownfield (where this new workload has to coexist and work together with legacy infrastructure). If your analysis is made simpler by considering a branny-new slate for a new project, how would you approach it?

 For example, here is the route

 &quot;ip route get&quot; for that particular IP shows the &quot;src&quot; as the IP of a NIC that is not the default route:

                              <span>Hello everybody. I would like to know if anyone has already configured this switch model via CLI. I don&#x27;t have much experience with this equipment and hiring a specialist is out of the question. When connecting a Dell R720 server directly to the switch, with 10G fiber ports, there is no network traffic.The scenario is as follows: Dell R720 (NIC: Intel(R) 10G 2P X520 Adapter) + Dell R640 (NIC 1: BRCM 10G/GbE 2+2P 57800 rNDC) connected to Dell S4128F. In the image you can see the active server connections on ports 13, 14, 15 and 16, on port 25 a DAC cable is connected to another Dell S4128F (redundancy) and on port 27 a 1Gbps cable is connected to interconnect with a Dell 6248 (legacy network). Basically I need these servers to have a 10G network working.Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi fellas
 I was searching info about network regionalization or in other words, how to split a multi vendor topology into defined domains per vendor. The FMO or final picture is SR-MPLS with flex-algo and TE.
 I need your opinions based on your experience or criteria about how do you will split and make those domains.My main concern its how do I made the peerings between domains. Should I use eBGP? BGP Confederation?? Bear in mind that the current topology has all PEs with an iBGP peering against a pair of route reflectors
 This is the current topology:
 Current
 This is what we are analizing:
 Future

                              <span>Hey All, 
 Long time lurker, first time posting. 
 I&#x27;ve got a bit of a situation that I thought I had a solution to, but am now stumped. Please excuse any ignorance or lack of detail. 
 The scenario is, we&#x27;ve got a location that just had a 3rd party install a Fortigate FW needed for remote access to their devices. Said firewall needs direct internet access. Normally this vendor would use an LTE device to accomplish this, but the location is out in the boonies and service sucks, so that option is out the window. 
 Our current ISP has a Ciena fiber hand off with two 1 gbe ports (will come back to why this is relevant), one of which is being used to connect to our firewall for Internet access. The demarc for this fiber circuit is in a separate building from where the 3rd party Fortigate fw is located. The two buildings are connected via mm fiber and use Brocade/Ruckus switches. 
 My initial thought was to run a link from the open port in the handoff, to our switch in an access port with a newly created vlan in building one, and trunk the vlan across the network to building two where the Fortigate is located (access port again) and assign the interface on the Fortigate one of the IP&#x27;s from our block. Well, that was the plan until I just got off the phone with our ISP, where the indicated that that open port is actually for an entirely new circuit that we would have to add to our account. So, I&#x27;m back to the drawing board. 
 As I eluded to early, we do have a block of IP&#x27;s (/29) that we can use so I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a solution, but I&#x27;m not sure how to achieve that. While I was only the phone with the ISP, they also indicated that in order to use that block, I&#x27;d have to have a L3 device to handle the routing of said block. I don&#x27;t think leadership will agree to purchasing any equipment for this as things have been extremely tight. 
 Apologies if this is all over the place, it&#x27;s been a hell of a day, and not just for the problem above. 
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi guys. My company will be having a new ISP line installed at a new site and I was shown what the IP details were by my colleague. I&#x27;m quite confused! This is my first time being involved in this sort of stuff so I&#x27;m trying to understand as much as I can.
 In our other offices we have ISP circuits where we have been given a /29 IP range and we just assign the IP of our firewalls from this range and point the default gateway to that of the ISP router so it is a lot simpler.
 Now it&#x27;s LAN IPs and WAN IPs and I&#x27;ve no idea how they relate to our current setup which is:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) &gt; L2 switch &gt; ISP router
 I know we need a router that will point all traffic to the ISP default gateway, that much is clear. There is a /29 range for the LAN side and a /30 for the WAN side.
 The way I see it is that we have to use 2 IPs from the /29 for the firewalls and another IP for the router interface facing the firewall. Then from the /30 range another router interface (pointing to the ISP router) will be configured with an IP and then a default route will point to the ISP&#x27;s default gateway.
 I think that our setup will then be:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) &gt; L2 switch (ISP failover) &gt; Router &gt; ISP router
 Am I on the right track with this or am I completely misunderstanding?

                              <span>Auditor says machine tunnels are insecure because it grants access to the network without a rotating one time key for MFA. So, someone could break into the device, extract the machine certificate, then install it on another device and use it for unauthorized access.
 What mitigations exists to prevent this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been struggling to bring up Private Peering on an ExpressRoute circuit delivered via Zayo. I&#x27;ve dug around for examples configuring this on a Nexus 9K and I&#x27;ve pieced a few things together, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get a BGP session up. I appreciate any insight you might share.
 On my side I have 1G service delivered from Zayo into an eth port on a Nexus C93180YC-FX running NXOS 9.3(10). Zayo indicated that I should use QinQ and they&#x27;re delivering the primary on VLAN A, secondary on VLAN B.
 My QinQ-fu isn&#x27;t strong but at a high level my understanding is that I should be receiving S-tags A and B and using C-tag C, which is what I&#x27;ve configured for VLAN ID in Azure. Do I have that backwards? Microsoft&#x27;s routing examples, though for IOS-XE, seem to indicate the reverse.
 I am consulting this article for configuring QinQ on the 9K.
 My issue is that all of the documentation I&#x27;m reading is around multiple inner tags with one outer tag. I believe I need the reverse. I&#x27;ve tried both the Configuring VLAN Mapping for Selective Q-in-Q on a 802.1Q Tunnel Port and Configuring Selective Q-in-Q with Multiple provider VLANs examples. I enter the first VLAN mapping switchport vlan mapping vlan-id-range dot1q-tunnel outer vlan-id and when I try to enter a second mapping with the same inner VLAN ID I receive an error about a conflicting mapping for the inner VLAN already existing on this port.
 Other info:
 I tried a configuration with just the primary to see if I could get BGP peering but nothing is coming up.

 I&#x27;m looking to do a breakout from a 400Gbps connection to multiple 25Gbps connections. Is this possible? If not, what are my other options?
 It seems that 400Gbps supports breakout only to 4x100Gbps ( https://community.fs.com/news/400g-qsfp-dd-solution-for-400g-data-center-interconnect.html ) . Is that right ? or I can somehow split 100Gbps further ?

 Laptop also has a 1G RJ45, and a second identical USB-C port.
 I think I need a new hub, but I can&#x27;t find a product. Does this product exist: * RJ45 in (2.5Gbps or higher) * RJ45 out (for phone) * USB-C to computer (network and monitor) * USB-C to monitor (displayport passthrough)
 Power supply from the hub isn&#x27;t needed. I may be willing to omit the RJ45 out to the phone and just forward it to my cell.

                              <span>Looking to better understand the puts and takes of buying waves from Lumen, Zayo, etc. - What are you using it for, pricing, where it makes sense vs. transit, etc. 
 Also, in this context, also curious if anyone has spoken with Cogent about their new wavlenegth product based on Sprint&#x27;s network. Does it solve anything for them?

                              <span>Hello, curious if anybody has an idea what could be causing the following error that I am seeing in the logs of our 9000 series Cisco switches:
 ​
 Examples (from different Switches):
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 5 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 F0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 ​
 This log pops up after a reboot in about 50% of the 300 or so C9000 Switches that I have polled so far. All Switches are running 17.03.05. A few have been upgraded to 17.06.05 for testing but the log error is apparent in both versions. So far, I have polled C9200-24T, C9200-24P, C9200-48P, C9200-48T and C9300-48Ps. All models show the log. Some are standalone switches, some are stacks with up to 8 switches.
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 connected to my switch https://www.tp-link.com/ca/business-networking/poe-switch/tl-sg1005p/
 which is then connected to my router. 
 ​
 Since I got this switch connected to my router I have been having issues accessing my router page and sometimes the devices don&#x27;t show up on my router. When they do show up the camera is not listed. I can still see my devices on blue iris which doesn&#x27;t see my camera.
 ​
 My cables are all CAT6 what am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Recently my organization had a minor debate about bandwidth; our ISP supplies a 1GB Fiber connection to our site. We have multiple VLANs and a fallback ISP with crossover, etc. The debate was about having several 50&quot; T.V.s streaming something constantly if this would cause a dramatic decline in LAN service. Let&#x27;s put a number of five (5) TVs.
 Some of our personnel are worried about internet-specific bandwidth. I recommended that we downgrade the stream quality to preserve bandwidth but limit each TV to 5Mbs max. Obviously, that is going to be 20Mpbs out of 1000Mbp. At max out usage is about 80Mbps at peak times. Meaning there is quite a bit of headway.
 My argument was LAN Bandwidth; we have servers/services/non-internet devices that are networked together. Let&#x27;s say we take a generic 100…</span>

 PS: I tried searching this on Google but since I have no idea what I am searching for I do not trust those results.

                              <span>Hey,
 So I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my chances of applying for Network Engineer role (again).
 My situation is kind of different from the ‘normal’ network engineer career path. 
 I had started as a junior network engineer as my first IT job(i got quite lucky) then after 3years of experience i got my CCNA certification. But due to a position limit for network engineer at our company my manager had asked me to change to Helpdesk engineer since we were lacking in that area. So now i have just over a year of experience in helpdesk as of now.
 Currently i am working towards my CCNP but i would like to ask what are my chances of getting a job back in as a network engineer? Since normally people go from helpdesk to network engineer. Will this be effect my chances of going back to network engineer?
 Any feedback on my chances and what i can do to improve my chances will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I’ve been in the Marine Corps Reserve as a Sys admin for 8 years now. During the majority of this time I’ve been operating heavy equipment for my civilian job, its pretty good money between 80k-100k a year depending on how much over time I chose to work. During this time I’ve accumulated bills like a house, wife, car, ect… in my military career I’ve gone over seas 3 times totaling about 2 years and some change of time spent in country working as a sys admin. This last deployment I really decided I wanted to pursue IT as a career. While deployed I got my Sec+ and started looking for jobs back home in the Chicago area. I’m struggling to find a job that pays enough to support my wife and current living expenses. I am willing to take a small pay cut to get started in the industry. I guess my question is does anyone have any guidance on how to proceed or what I should do. 
 Note: I absolutely hate my current job. 
 And I still have an active security clearance if that helps

I&#x27;m not doing well mentally, I&#x27;m just feeling overwhelmed and nervous about this. I&#x27;m not like this when I have a job and I&#x27;m interviewing, not sure if there are any recommendations on something I can do to cool my nerves before hand or not; aside from drinking that is.

                              <span>I’m having a hard time from HR at new places because of “Proof of Education” and was wondering if something can be done considering my extensive IT experience? I’ll elaborate. 
 I went to university 10 years ago for Mechanical engineering and I dropped out 2 years later to pursue a career in Aviation. 
 I worked 2-3 odd jobs at once for several years and paid my Pilot school and became a Commercial Aircraft Pilot. Once I got my license, I started my instructor training to become a flight instructor and that’s when COVID happened. Aviation took a shit and every captain I knew were suddenly jobless and seeing how versatile the industry was I decided to switch into tech because I’ve always been a very tech savvy guy since I was a kid.

                              <span>So I had a company reach out to me after viewing my resume and gave me the song and dance stating they felt I would be an amazing fit, my experience is exactly what they need, blah blah blah.
 The job was for a systems engineering/architect position 
 In the email they told me to select three days that would be good to interview and a bit more about what I do.
 I responded and sent the days they were asking for a went into more detail about my job, related tasks, but kept it quite brief so to save the rest for the interview.
 Well the first day I put on there was for yesterday and I heard nothing, so I sent a follow up email asking if the interview was still occurring and the day ends with me still hearing nothing.
 So I looked up the company the following day again to make sure it is a legitimate company, which it is, just to make sure I wasn’t getting messed with.
 Why ask to interview me just to ghost me and not have the decency to at least tell me something.
 The job market is tough enough as is for most people, companies that do this do not make things any better.
 Is this common?

 Really seems like it&#x27;s been going WAY downhill with barracuda the last couple weeks. Also was notified today &quot;oops we might have blocked everything today, so uh, go through that mess manually&quot;
 If you are coming up on a renewal, I&#x27;d strongly look at alternatives. Mimecast and proofpoint look viable but I haven&#x27;t started digging way in yet.

                              <span>What was the best excuse you have come up with for not going into work? For me, it was &quot;I quit 2 weeks ago. I am NEVER coming in again.&quot;
 Anyhow, in another group this was asked and I had to laugh when someone wrote this as the reason that they were not coming into work:
 &quot;Sorry boss these past couple days have been quite explosive. I&#x27;ll spare you the details but it&#x27;s a complete disaster. Like lava coming out of places you don&#x27;t want it to come out of. It has unfortunately affected my ability to work the past 48 hours but seems to be improving. I&#x27;ll keep you posted. Thank you&quot;
 What was really going on? Check out the link. Popo Eruption
 Yeah, they have a very good excuse, don&#x27;t you agree?

 There&#x27;s also this new &#x27;Dev Drive&#x27; available in the store to try out, and a bunch of other things like a more native GitHub integration and co-pilot.
 Oh yeah and Windows Store apps will now finally incorporate the feature Windows Phone had and have native backup/restore functionality, so that switching PC&#x27;s requires less preference reconfiguration.

                              <span>Hello all,My company is on the way to complete the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process. One open and hotly discussed point is the logging issue.I am a big friend of &quot;GrayLog&quot; which we have been using for a long time in the free version. However, our IT security officer says that a protection against manipulation of the log events cannot be guaranteed. The product variant &quot;GRAYLOG SECURITY&quot; would fulfill this requirement, but due to the licensing of the complete Elasticsearch stack with the machine learning features and the &quot;top-notch-enterprise&quot; requirements on the base system (Oracle DB etc.) this is unfortunately too expensive for us.I found this method on the net to write a signature in each event and validate it again on readout (https://community.graylog.org/t/graylog-for-integrity-log-hashing/15570), however this is obviously not enough as a user with admin rights could easily manipulate these hashes.Has anyone ever done the GRAYLOG FREE task as ISO/IEC 27001 compliant logging and can give me some hints on how to implement this?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Some people here may understand the situation we&#x27;re in.
 Basically, we have singular users working in remote parts of the UK (literally miles from the nearest mobile tower), where mobile dongles/sim hubs just do not work. The users have relatively low bandwidth usage, they mainly use SharePoint for Word and Excel collaboration, possibly some infrequent Teams calls. 
 We&#x27;ve had quotes in the past for installing leased lines (far too expensive and takes far too long for the cable to be laid; 3-6 months for a 12 month project) 
 Basically, we&#x27;ve tested StarLink (the standard residential edition) and it&#x27;s an absolute godsend. It&#x27;s relieved such a massive headache for the onsite user and from me from a sysadmin perspective. 
 We don&#x27;t need the business edition, it&#x27;s far too expensive (£2400 for the kit and £240 p/m) and we don&#x27;t need the bandwidth or speeds. It&#x27;s literally 1 person in a cabin working from 1 PC...
 Should we continue down this road or do you think we could encounter issues in the future using the residential service? I do feel it&#x27;s slightly amoral? 
 Thanks guys

                              <span>TOTP is something that can be self-hosted. Completely vendor-neutral.
 The TOTP &quot;server&quot; could be self-hosted, and users could be told to use Google Authenticator, Authy, etc. If banks didn&#x27;t want to do that, they could build a TOTP client in a day into their apps.
 Why is it that if a bank supports TOTP, it seems they can only do phone or email authentication? 
 AND, for apps on my phone that require passwords but log me out periodically (CHASE), it would be great to see in the app a warning for days left in session. I didn&#x27;t always keep a copy of my password database in my phone, and so I could be across the country and suddenly be locked out of my bank accounts.
 TLDR - Bank 2FA seems to blow, with no indication as to why, and their session management also sucks.
 If anyone has insight, let me know. I figure this is appropriate for /r/sysadmin because I have been in the field and wonder what is holding the security teams back from doing things correctly at these institutions.

                              <span>I see a lot of sentimentality in this sub around the idea that technicians and engineers who have strong skillsets and problem solving are good at their jobs.

 I wanted to broach the subject of what being Good at your Job in IT actually should look like, and why being very skilled doesn&#x27;t automatically make you good at your job.
 Our entire industry is a service industry. Even our engineers, are working in service to other departments in some fashion. Outside of maybe the deepest depths of DevOps, our sector is mostly customer (users are interchangeable with customers for internal departments) service oriented.

 I have created a case at Duo support, but they haven&#x27;t responded back, so i figured id try my luck here, maybe someone already done the migration

                              <span>TL/DR: Foster kid’s charity collecting laptops to rebuild for foster kids, tax write off given for computer donations 
 Hi folks, 
 I replied to a post here a while ago about how I collect laptops and rebuild them for foster kids and families in Denver, Colorado, USA. I had a lot of private messages sent to me asking how to help but haven’t been able to post till now. 
 I have been in IT officially for about 6 years now and after I had one foster child who kept punching my laptop when he got mad at a game, I thought that maybe other foster families had this same issue and needed a repaired laptop or a laptop for the kids. I worked with my office building and started collecting any desktop/laptops that were in the basement Tom be recycled, made about 100 systems - then the pandemic hit and the demand went up. 
 I’ve been able to rebuild about 400+ laptops on my own (windows, Mac, a few Ubuntu set ups) and distribute them - but we’re running low and the need keeps growing. 
 If anyone wants to unload systems for tax credit through a registered 501c3, we can accept donations and send you a blank form for tax write offs, and even make a post thanking you on linked in for free marketing. The goal is that you and your company win, and the kids win. 
 Though I expose my identity a bit doing this, here is a LinkedIn link where you can search the history of this charity I run and who I partner with to know it’s legit.

 No pressure, but if you can help, there are lots of foster kids and families in our area who could use these!

                              <span>Ran into an issue I&#x27;ve not experienced in Autopilot today. When using the latest &quot;Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -Online&quot;, I eventually got the &quot;806 - ZtdDeviceAlreadyAssigned&quot; error. No big deal, dummy me did a typo on the serial number. Well, I went through Intune Enrollment and also verified in MS4B that this device serial number does not exist. Looking in AAD, it also verifies the device is in Autopilot but I cannot find it to assign a new tag to the device. 
 Since the device hash is clearly registered but cannot find it from the serial number (and no the mobo hasn&#x27;t been replaced), how can I find the device to assign the necessary group tag?

                              <span>so we are migrating our dns from current provider (oracle\dyn) to Amazon Route 53 and I have questions.
 testing our first move, on one site we decreased the TTL on the oracle\dyn side, and set it low on Amazon side. so do we then go to our domain host and add the amazon dns servers, or do we instead remove dyndns and THEN add amazon once we see the TTL updated? IPs are not changing at all, just moving the DNS.

The course does not announce these cancellations, instead they make customers check back with their calendar on their website. My question is, would anyone know of a way to continuously scan this website&#x27;s calendar to look for open tee times?

 ​
 I setup a virtual DC on my PC 3 years ago with a domain, accounts etc and then went away and got on with my life. I&#x27;ve now come back to it and can&#x27;t remember any account details etc (yes I know I should have kept some kind of a record) any ideas on how to get back into my server

 I am trying to implement so that separate admin accounts can promote themselves to Domain Admin when they need it temporarily. Is there is a way to do this?
 Or is the best way to create a master domain account locked down to only login into the DCs that perhaps the IT manager could promote the account or maybe do the domain admin task required.
 ​
 Thanks for any advice.

 Does anyone have a script that would report on all machines in a domain that have Bitlocker enabled? I have been testing a few I found online but none of them works.
 Thank you in advance.

 I searched on Google without finding an answer to my problem.
 I have a traefik running on a docker compose that has an ip in 192.168.20.34 and I want to redirect the traffic from blabla.fr to a machine in 192.168.20.130. I can&#x27;t figure out how to set up the traefik so that it works. For my other apps that run under docker-compose and that are on the same machine everything works perfectly

                              <span>Should IT Managers/Directors literally be the gatekeeper of all things with administrator control over EVERYTHING in EVERY Department within an organizational network?? 
 What are your thoughts??

                              <span>Looking to move my AD master over from Server 2012r2 to a newer 2019 VM. Am I missing something? Also the &quot;-Identity FSMO-DC&quot; is that the old master I presume? So it should be &quot;-Identity AD-1&quot;? Does it look like I&#x27;m missing anything from this? Already did all the checks for sysvol and whatnot and everything seems good!

                              <span>I recently took a new job at a place and I’m completely overwhelmed. Old IT guy set up local accounts on all the computers. They’re not joined to a domain and he has everyone’s passwords written down. There’s no ticketing system. No group policy. No system images. No software deployment tools. No standard computer that they’re ordering, just whatever seems good on Amazon. No naming convention for devices. He’s got users in AD for their email address but besides that, pretty much nothing.
 I’m trying to take a deep breath on this stuff as I know these changes take time, but I’m not used to an overhaul like this. My gauge in the company is that they aren’t going to want to spend money to make changes because it has “worked” for this long. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should prioritize and approach this?

 https://northwave-cybersecurity.com/threat-intel-research/analysis-of-new-active-malware-mediaarena-pua
 We have several hundred machines in our environment that we confirmed have it installed and we are trying to find a way to remove it. I&#x27;ve drilled down into the registry and found the uninstall string but the one it lists basically just deletes the key.
 cmd.exe /c reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\PDFPower /f
 Has anyone found a better way to uninstall it via script? As I&#x27;m not confident that actually uninstalls the app and it just removes it from being listed in the registry and programs/features.
 If you&#x27;re dealing with this you&#x27;re aware is sets your default search engine to one their own (AASearchpoweronline). Is resetting edge settings enough to fix that?

I have even clicked it off in properties and after it is applied it will still revert back. Have ran the cmd to remove the attributes and still occuring. I have also gone into security and disabled inheritance and changed permissions to full control as well.
 Any help would be appreciated as everything I find online and tried is not allowing me to make folders not read only.

                              <span>hey folks, 
 i am getting pretty frustrated with this, i have built a small lab env with a domain controller that is acting as a DNS server .
 i am trying t o manually add a DNS record in the forward lookup zone for a linux machine , which is not joined into the domain . 
 ​
 pretty straight forward i want the hostname to be resolved to that static IP however , adding a New Host always assumes that i want to add a FQDN for that machine . which in my case isn&#x27;t i just want to add machine called Linux1
 ​
 I tried and created a new FLZ named only Linux1 and then added a new entry and left the name blank so it inherited the domain name which is Linux1.
 But still no Luck , when i try to ping Linux1
 ​
 Ping request could not find host Linux1 .Please check the name and try again.
 ​
 Any help would be appreciated

 Edit: appears this might be Zscaler ZIA related! Try disabling the service and seeing if your response times return to some normality.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve got a technical interview coming up today for a junior sysadmin role. I&#x27;m a bit nervous, but it&#x27;s for a relatively small MSP with a relatively small team 
 What should I expect and are there any common mistakes I should avoid? Or just anything in general that might help me. They seem really excited to have me come in and the job offer is already on the table, I&#x27;m just scared that I&#x27;ll mess it up.
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Hello! Yesterday we received an email about software problems in our Polish site, where the software used to control machine equipment in our factory &quot;crashed&quot; several times during the last week. I put crashed between &quot;&quot; because they listed various complaints under the word &#x27;crashed&#x27;, including computers freezing up and computers supposedly rebooting on their own. The communication is a bit hard since they do sometimes use Google Translate when English becomes too hard. 
 The software runs on a server and the desktop computers, all Windows 10, connect to the server using the installed WinCC application on them. The computers were recently updated to version 22H2 right around the time the issues started to occur more frequently, but after talking with the people onsite this problems has bee…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I am looking to automate our laptop/PC deployment a bit. Atm Im manually configuring our laptops (all Windows) which is rather something I know I could automate. 
 What&#x27;s ur recommendation of grasping this if we&#x27;re using G Suite with a GCPW? Is anyone in the same boat? Should we consider migrating to O365 for ease of things like this? Thanks.

 Effectively I want to simulate accepting a meeting invitation, so that it schedules the meeting in both my Teams and Outlook calendars (assuming I haven&#x27;t been emailed a meeting invitation and am unable to get the organiser to do so).
 Or is this not possible?

                              <span>i dont know what physics or engineering term would desribe a scenario whereby no matter what input you give a machine the output will always be the same or wont increase.
 I think have reached that point or about to reach that point where you no longer care about working extra hard, pleasing users and execs, going the extra mile, being innovative etc 
 Reason? it seems like my efforts are not recognised and rewarded 
 To be frank if i start working according to my job description now i will be seen as slacking because i have normalized working extra hard and going the extra mile since day one, taking calls on weekends, after hours, lucnh time etc, speedy resolution of issues (its now 3 and a half years now as helpdesk IT technician)
 To be fair as well i have not increased qualifications on paper but i have upskilled on the job and taken up extra tasks which were not initially on my job description -specifically im now somewhat of a lite system admin because i have been opened to some administration tasks and given rights to several systems 
 The companies, systems and users to support has grown a lot in the past 3 years and the parent company is on track to launch new companies who we will all support 
 Still the paycheck is the same as it was 3 years ago.

                              <span>Hola,
 I own an business on Fiverr, however, I have a big problem, the managers who reply to the clients (based in Phillipines) that are logged into my account can delete the whole account!
 I am trying to figure out the best way to make it so that they cannot access certain sensitive pages, such as ‘analytics’, ‘gigs’, ‘settings’, etc.
 I am tech savvy but I have absolutely no clue the best way to do this? I was thinking about a virtual desktop service where they log in to a user, and that computer has some great programming that blocks those URLS, but that may be a bit glitchy, i’m not sure.
 I need advice on the best way to do this? 
 Thank you,
 Harry

                              <span>In my previous place of work we have a few sets of Yealink conference solutions and the CPW90 works really well and versatile. Where I&#x27;m at now uses those Surface Hub look-alikes and their built in microphone sucks. Management refuse to implement an actual microphone solution and just blame the bad audio on f/w and this and that.
 I looked around and I have never seen anyone tried/done that, connecting a CPW90 to a PC. Does anyone here had any experience?
 I am thinking if a generic DECT receiver / base station will be compatible with it.
 Or, does anyone has recommendations for products with similar form factor (1 base station, 2 wireless microphones, similar price tag is a big plus)

                              <span>Hello,
 Everything is in the title, I even tried to apply the new MS template instead of the legacy rule we had for that alert and still detects when internal users are added.
 https://i.postimg.cc/TY0KVt2p/image.png
 It detects that those users are in the External group, but they are not (I actually checked and there are no users with any of our domains). It started happening with no change on our part like 2-3 weeks ago.
 Any idea ?
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>Hey guys, looking for a bit of input here.
 I&#x27;ve been doing desktop-come-everything support at my role (200ish global staff) for 3 and a half years so far, and am looking to get a decent payrise this time round. Did 5ish years helpdesk L1/L2 prior, am 30something years oldnow.
 My boss sent me an email this afternoon politely saying &#x27;I&#x27;d like to see you up your Azure training and get some certs&#x27;.
 ​
 Unfortunately, this is also after last week saying &#x27;What can we do to help you because I&#x27;m considering calling in outside help&#x27; because everyone&#x27;s started to pick up on my burnout.
 ​
 When I joined as desktop support, I was basically doing everything I was on the MSP side for these guys as helpdesk, plus it was now in person - so it was a sweet gig. 
 I started out on 60k NZD, then got bumped…</span>

 Currently we are looking for a program to take care of our security awareness program. We are looking into different vendors but currently can not seem to think of a con for Metacompliance. Basically all other vendors have at least some cons. Can you all help us with possible cons?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I&#x27;m a Sr.System Admin at University.
 We create an Azure AD account for students that serves as their email address, and SSO which allows login on public terminals in the library, access to various applications such as MS Office, PeopleSoft (student information system) etc.
 Students and Staff also bring their own devices to access all cloud-based SaaS products and applications on and off-campus
 On-campus Macs and PCs are managed using Azure Mobile Device Management (MDM). 
 My questions are:
 - Within the premise, students can connect their personal devices using wireless which only has internet access. Do you apply on the boarding checklist or MDM before granting access? We use SAML authentication.
 - Outside the premise, is it feasible to register thousands of devices into an MDM and implement a compliance checklist? Any tips and suggestions to apply to security measures to protect data and information?

 I have installed latest CU (2023-May) on my servers. 
 But , tenable is still reporting this vulnerability to us. 
 But , the MSQM service is still running on the servers and port 1801.
 I honestly thought patching will disable it after patching.
 Has anyone manually disabled MSMQ service and closed port 1801? Any issues afterward?

                              <span>Hi, 
 Not sure where to start. A bit of background, Our organisation uses office 365 for emails, teams, and excel. We save all our files onto Egnyte. 
 We have an excel spreadsheet with high level financial projections for project invoicing (45 projects) then we have a seperate excel for resourcing planning, and finally each project has 3 excels for document control management and project deliverables. All these are saved on Egnyte. 
 I’m looking to hire someone to create a digital data dashboard for each project to see the high level data in one place that’s currently spread across 100 excel sheets. I want to reduce the amount of manual data transfer and human error in data input between various seperate excel files duplicating the same data. 
 I understand a lot of this data might need aggregating into a dataset saved on the cloud and then additional applications used to process and present the data such as power bi but I do not know the order or priority of setting an outline brief for someone to price the work for our organisation. 
 Any help would be welcome. 
 I am open to radical changes in the way information is structured and push towards cloud based office 365.

                              <span>I ordered Vertical Cable keystone jacks off a recommendation from a site that are allegedly pros who install the same system as mine (ubiquiti), but ever since I installed them and patched in with pure copper patch cables, my system keeps intermittently dropping my APs randomly throughout the day. I checked the page for the keystone jacks, and come to find in the specs it says “gold plated brass connectors”… I’m not a professional or anything but I do know that connectors that are not pure copper can have issues carrying POE current (such as CCA)… I’m trying to figure out what the issue could be, and I’m wondering if the interface medium could be the culprit before I start tearing everything apart and ordering new stuff. I would assume these “ubiquiti pros” wouldn’t recommend a product that clearly doesn’t work with the POE powered APs, but stupider things have happened.

                              <span>This was a first for me... I get a ticket that BGP is down between two peers, which are connected by a carrier ethernet circuit. I can&#x27;t ping from one to the other, but both show the int is up/up. On the A side, I reset counters, and notice that my RX packets and bytes exactly matches my TX packets and bytes. Also odd, I see the A size in A&#x27;s LLDP neighbors table, showing in/out port to be the same. B side sees up/up, but BGP is down, and B can&#x27;t see anything from other side (no lldp either).
 Has anybody ever seen a carrier disconnect a circuit by making it loop back to itself? (Lumen, in this case)

                              <span>Is there any way to &quot;translate&quot; or &quot;map&quot; a device&#x27;s IP to a different IP in a L3 switch without NAT capabilities?
 My situation is: I&#x27;d like to avoid changing the device&#x27;s configuration and I need to connect several (about 30) devices with identical IPs configured, while having no IP conflicts and being able to access every individual device through HTTP.
 For example, have the &quot;192.168.1.1/24&quot; in port 1 become &quot;192.168.10.1/24&quot;, then have &quot;192.168.1.1/24&quot; in port 2 become &quot;192.168.10.2/24&quot; and so on... And then access the device in port &quot;n&quot; through &quot;192.168.10.n/24&quot; from another device, which would actually be correctly configured as &quot;192.168.10.40/24&quot;.
 Or maybe there&#x27;s a way to use the router&#x27;s NAT configs and VLANs somehow? But I don&#x27;t know if the fact that all the devices being configured in the same subnet would allow me to assign them to different VLANs, as far as I understand, each VLAN in a L3 switch should have a different subnet. I can&#x27;t picture it. Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t make sense. I know it&#x27;s not a typical use case but I figured I&#x27;d ask the experts.

                              <span>Greetings,
 This is a two part question.
 What would be a use case to have employees authenticate to AD before using company guest Wi-Fi services. I see some enterprises deploy two guest (no internal access) Wi-Fi services, one for guests and one for employees. I would like to know what benefit, other employee tracking, would be achieved by authenticating employees for guest Wi-Fi and opening the dmz to internal for this sake.
 The second question is whether any NAC product can authenticate guest Wi-Fi employee access locally via email confirmation sent to company email, I.e. by giving a temporary email only access during authentication so that the confirmation Code is received to the user on his corporate email. This is to avoid AD authentication and punching a hole from dmz to internal AD servers.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>There must be something simple I&#x27;m missing -- ideas are appreciated.
 I have three switches (QNAP, FS, and SuperMicro), each with SFP28 (25Gb) ports. The ports works fine for connecting to servers, both using DAC cables and fiber with transceivers.
 However, I am unable to get any two of the switches to connect to each other via SFP28 ports. The ports on both sides act like nothing is connected to the port. The switches do communicate fine via RJ45 ports.
 Any idea what I&#x27;m missing here? Seems like a really basic thing to do (using SFP28 ports for uplink).

 I&#x27;m coming up empty and my searching apparently sucks.
 For those curious this is to run MACVLAN in VEPA mode.

                              <span>Hey fellow network admins,
 I wanted to get some advice on an odd issue ive been running down for a while. 
 In short, I have a medical clinic with an older Xray machine with a Linux workstation. Basically getting a lot of TCP resend requests from this device when communicating with its local PACS server ( same location, both connected to the same switch). Further investigation with packet capture, I see at the point where it fails i get a TCP ZeroWindow reply from the Xray machine
 Its my understanding that the TCP window size should be negotiated between the 2 devices in the initial SYN, and should Match. However the Xray machine shows a window of 50000, and the Server its communicating with shows 64240 for the window size. 
 Is there a way on Server 2019 to set that window size? I found regfixes that were for server 2003, but did not work. I also turned off autotuning, no change. 
 The Xray machine is old, so I&#x27;m suspecting that&#x27;s what we are running into, but I wanted to confirm if I had any options to set this on my server side.

                              <span>Just asking to confirm.
 I want to do a config replace on all of our edge switches. The goal is to ensure consistency and make sure all the configs are the same. So going to make a golden config and push it out to all switches with a config replace.
 With doing this, there is no reason the switch needs to reboot, correct? Just want to make sure no one is going to lose connectivity when doing this.

                              <span>Hey everybody just a quick question this morning for yeah. I’m primarily an end user support tech but my company no longer has a network engineer so I’ve gotten to take up most of the projects they would be working on. I haven’t played around with networking topologies or just about anything except an Ethernet cable for the last few years. 
 My question is if I am installing ip cameras that will be powered with PoE should I be using 568A or 568B? I’ve looked up a few things online but nothing is super straight forward or giving me one linear answer. 
 Any help is massively appreciated!

                              <span>So I am trying to understand the benefit of VLANs and how they work still. Hopefully I can clearly and concisely explain my setup and confusion.
 In this example network topology, there is currently zero VLAN or network segmentation. We have one WAN feeding a Fortinet Firewall, with the Fortinet configured for DHCP relay pointing to a 2012 R2 server. This server only has one scope that all devices live in. The scope is 10.10.8.1/22 (but only handing IPs out from 10.10.8.10 - 10.10.9.248). Then the Fortinet is feeding a few miscellaneous switches that are essentially dummy switches all daisy chained together feeding them. There is zero configuration on them.
 So now I have a new HP 1920S switch I would like to integrate. And I would like to segment 36 out of the 48 ports of this switch into 3 different VLANs that cannot interact with our main 10.10.8.1/22 network. The groups being VLAN10; ports 1-12, VLAN20; ports 13-24, and VLAN30; ports 25-36, while using port 48 as a trunk for the 3 VLANs. This &quot;trunk&quot; (HP terms) is being fed into the piggybacked dummy switches. But when I test the isolation of these VLANs by plugging in two devices across two different VLAN segments, I can still ping eachother. This is where I think my lack of foundational network knowledge is hurting me...
 Even though I have 3 different VLANs configured on the switch, do I also need to create 3 different DHCP scopes to truly separate the various VLAN traffic from each other and the rest of the 10.10.8.1/22 network? If so, how do I tell the relevant VLAN traffic to be assigned to these new particular DHCP scopes? Is that done through more configuration in the HP switch, itself? I am trying to determine if I setup VLAN incorrectly and it&#x27;s not behaving how it should, or it&#x27;s setup correctly and my understanding isn&#x27;t correct.
 I hope this makes sense. Thank you for any input!

                              <span>Hello. Just wondering if there are folks here who worked with migrating legacy circuits to ethernet based network. We have a customer who is trying to abandon their old network that consists a lot of FR/HDLC/PPP interfaces. They are currently connected to a channelized STM1 interface of a Cisco ASR9000 router. The core network is running MPLS but they want to move the connections to the newer ASR9900 routers while they convince customers to move to ethernet and they no longer want to introduce legacy circuit types into the 9900 routers (not sure if there&#x27;s any module that still supports it there) The interfaces consists of L3VPN and L2VPN doing interworking. Are there any suggestions here on what device we can possibly put in to migrate those legacy circuits into a separate box so that we just connect that box into the ASR9900 as ethernet? There are suggestions that we use an ASR 1000 as the CE for these connections. Any other products outside Cisco shop? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Question to the floor. Is it possible maybe with RADIUS attribute pairs to apply a command on login that would be specific to a user like setting terminal length or know of a way that might achieve this? We do use Cisco IOS but intreguied if this is possible.

                              <span>There&#x27;s the smart switch function which I have no issues with. However, since I&#x27;m taking a home exam, I will prefer my connection to be 2.4 Ghz instead of having no idea when it will switch me back and forth between 2.4 and 5 Ghz.
 The thing is this. Each time I tried to configure WPA3 or WPA3+WPA2, there will be a &quot;Please Correct Error&quot; thing that comes out. After waiting for some time, 5 Ghz encryption always goes back to &#x27;None - Open&#x27;.
 Was anyone able to configure 5Ghz encryption successfully to WPA3+WPA2?

 Hope the Reddit Gods can help me out with this one.
 So I have one switch with two ports aggregated and using LACP. They connect to a stack switch with two members, to one port on each member. The two ports on the stack are also a part of a LAG with LACP enabled.
 My question is should one member of the stack die what exactly happens after the LACP timeout occurs on the other member?
 Thank you

 I hope someone here can point me in the right direction where to start because I have been trying but cannot figure out what&#x27;s happening:
 Issue:Both my MacMini as well as my MacBook have problems connecting to my Private WiFi (Guest WiFi works fine). Once connected get assigned an IPv4 Address but loose it right away and assign themselves an IPv6 Address. The IPv4 Information in the macOS Settings is empty. Once I click on &quot;Renew DHCP Lease&quot; it gets assigned an IP again and Connection works for around 10 seconds before it disappears again.
 Setup:Devices: MacBook Pro 2015, MacMini M1Network: Ubiquity Unifi Dream Machine, Connected via WiFi to main Network, already opened a ticket with support but they told me the logs look fine and they cannot find anything. The Devices appear as offline in the Unifi Interface despite being connected.
 Is this a Unifi Issue or a macOS Issue? Where can I start to look for fixesThanks so much in advance for any help!!

 The question may sound stupid, because there are a lot of articles and videos showing how to do this. But it doesn&#x27;t work for me.
 What I did:
  
I set SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable
 Rebooted my computer
 I&#x27;ve run Wireshark and was surfing a site I want to see a traffic for
 Stopped Wireshark. The log file isn&#x27;t empty.
 In Wireshark, I went to Edit/Preferences/Protocols/TLS and for input field (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename I set path to file which I&#x27;ve set path to in SSLKEYLOGFILE variable
  
After all that I see following in Wireshark: https://ibb.co/qBm0Kc3
 I use Windows 10 and Wireshark 4.0.5
 How can I fix that?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 We have finalllyyyyyy gotten some test lab hardware.
 So now i am playing with 2 nexus 9k&#x27;s and have upgraded them to 10.3.3.F ( in production today we are running 9.3.10 ).
 And the most wanted feature has been commit and rollback like we have on XR&#x27;s.
 With the conf dual-stage that is now a thing on nexus&#x27;es running code 10.1(2) or newer.
 What are your thoughts on this, and also have you guys used it?
 Main thing that annoys me a bit, is that it doesn&#x27;t replace configure ( conf t ).
 And also that you cannot do a config banner, to remind people that they should use conf dual-stage

                              <span>Hi,
 I have an issue where some devices dont get an ip address in certain subnet. For example in floor one everything works including the problematic devices. In floor 2 everything works except 1 desktop and few cisco meeting room touch panels. Both device are in the same vlan including laptops and the laptops work perfectly, its the same vlan and the same dhcp server, also cisco phones and access points work perfectly as well but on different vlans Note: each floor has each own broadcast domain and the address range is not fully utilaized I have run wireshark and the dhcp offer packet is missing., I see the device request an apipanaddress from the dhcp and the dhcp is replying with NAK massage Any idea why this specific devices wouldnt get dhcp?
 Thanks for help

                              <span>Hi all,
 Been working as a network admin/engineer for the past 7 years, based primarily on Aruba WiFi &amp; Switching/Arista Switch/Cisco Routing/Palo Alto firewalls &amp; SD-WAN/F5 load balancers &amp; also Splunk. 
 I have been presented an opportunity for a role as a senior network engineer. The role is based on Fortinet SD-WAN/Firewalls, Ubiquiti WiFI/Switching. Company consists of a large number of sites, though the sites are small in size, so Ubiquiti makes sense for their business requirements. 
 Something that is making me hesitant, is the fact that this company is using Ubiquiti WiFi/Switching &amp; doesn&#x27;t sound like there is much of a solid plan to move away from this to an enterprise solution. The cash for this role is more than what I am currently on, but I am a little concerned that by taking the role, my skills with enterprise equipment will squander, and it will be hard to move into a more enterprise role in the future. 
 I use Ubiquiti equipment at home, and it is fine, but not sure I&#x27;d use it an enterprise setting. 
 TLDR: If I take a role working on Ubiquiti equipment, will this tarnish my resume/skillset?

 I&#x27;m hoping for some advice/guidance. I&#x27;ve been in this field since 2009 starting as an intern at a large service provider. My career trajectory looks like this:
 associate switch technician (maintaining all the equipment that processed voice and data cellular calls) --&gt; &quot;systems technician&quot; which meant setting up the data center at the same service provider and then maintaining the routers and switches --&gt; brief stint working on one of their application platforms after years of data center work --&gt; got laid off and went to work in a NOC doing actual troubleshooting and some software upgrades / hardware upgrades with remote hands --&gt; bouncing around jobs every couple years as a network engineer, almost entirely doing the routing/switching side of things.

                              <span>TL;DR - Zoom sucks as a voice platform and apparently someone is spoofing our DIDs. Is this really an up and coming attack businesses are facing or is Zoom compromised and/or buggy and dialing themselves. 
 We use Zoom as our voice platform and recently (within the last week) we started getting reports that just seemed odd. It started with a few users stating that people were calling their DID numbers and saying they were returning a missed call. The two users swore that they never called these people and one was a current customer and the other some random person. The strange thing was that there was no record of an outbound call to either of these callers in the zoom portal phone logs. These two users attributed it to some glitch in the matrix and moved on with their lives.

                              <span>I need to start assembling some quotes for NTP appliances for our Small-Medium Enterprise environment. 
 I want something that can pull GPS time, and Internet NTP, and maybe FM radio time. 
 We currently use our core ASR routers and I want to shift that responsibility off the routers (so they can just be standard NTP clients) and onto something with a precision hardware clock. 
 We are financial services, but have no requirement for PTP, So I just need NTPv4. 
 I might upgrade from a standard clock to an OCXO style oscillator, but we don&#x27;t need Rubidium precision. 
 I&#x27;ll probably buy four appliances.
 One in each data center, one in each major user site.
 Our data centers have historically difficult GPS reception, so I don&#x27;t want to put all four in the 2 data centers. 
 The Symmetricom / Microsemi / Microchip S600 appliance is one product we&#x27;ll get quotes on. 
 The Meinberg LANTime M1000 is another contender. 
 The Meinberg SyncFire 1200 feels like an updated M1000, so I&#x27;ll explore that further as well. 
  
What other products in this space should I be looking at? 
  
Microsemi&#x27;s Domain Time NTP client for Windows (and other OSes).
 Is this something worth exploring, or should I just leave Microsoft&#x27;s w32time alone?
 I hate the way the PDC-emulator is the only device that feeds time into the rest of the domain.
 It violates the inherent resiliency of the NTP protocol&#x27;s design. 
  
As always, the wisdom of the great collective is always appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone, i don&#x27;t know if this subreddit is the right one, but i have a question about an implementataion of SAP B1 with a SUSE DB.
 The problem appears when the consultant wants to share a folder from the SUSE Server with a Guest account, but in my domain the Group policy that allows that is disable by default. They say SAP established that is imperative to make the change to work.
 They gave me a microsoft KB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/guest-access-in-smb2-is-disabled-by-default) to disable that policy and the shared folder works, but its an insecure practice and no one recommend it.
 It appers that the top management is going to push for this to happen.. Is this really the only way to do it as they say? can it be done in a more secure way? do i cross my arms when a ramsonware fuck things up?
 thanks in advance

                              <span>As the title says I’m curious as to what professions former sysadmins have gone to?
 I’ve been working over a decade in the field but I’m burnt out &amp; simply over it…fielding the seemingly endless on-call duties, addressing security breaches in the middle of the night, or ruined weekend plans due to emergency maintenance. 
 I’ve had enough as it’s not worth the compensation or my mental health (been dealing with panic attacks that seemingly popped up out of nowhere - as someone who doesn’t experience them often, it’s been terrifying).
 But yeah, just looking for suggestions and feedback on what day jobs you all have migrated to since leaving IT…I continue to work on my side hustle that I hope to eventually transition to full time but until that day comes I’ve still gotta hustle.

 Reached out to Microsoft, multiple times and no one understood the issue until finally were now supposedly waiting for a call from an engineer in the identity team. It’s been almost 2 weeks now with no real response other than a rep offering to make a note on a tik. 
 Anyone know of a resource to expedite this?

 https://bmcsites.force.com/casemgmt/sc_KnowledgeArticle?sfdcid&#x3D;kA214000000dAoUCAU&amp;type&#x3D;Solution
 These are instructions for how to update java on your server. Ya know, java, the software with new and amazing critical vulnerabilities every other week. Well, BMC&#x27;s solution for updating java for their java based software is that you need to hand edit dozens of files, registry keys, and environmental variables every single time. And because its java and it updates constantly you&#x27;ll be doing it over and over. You&#x27;d better hope to god there were no mistakes either because remedy also generates hundreds of logs in improbable locations containing what might as well be alien hieroglyphs. This issue is one of hundreds of problems with this software. 
 One time I had to get a developer on the line (which took an act of god and over a week) because I followed their own instructions and it blew up my system. He told me the support article in question missed a critical step that would always blow up your system if you didn&#x27;t do it. Apparently, updating the support articles was an ongoing project.
 My company is currently trying to switch vendors and I will do everything in my power to make it happen. If you have this software god help you.

                              <span>You could file this under a few dysfunctional categories. Full disclosure - I’m a people manager now, still wear quite a few hats, used to be a sysadmin, and I felt this rant slotted well here…
 So, I&#x27;m in the middle of driving my morning IT operations meeting and I&#x27;m getting Teams calls and messages from HR. ADP is “not working” and ADP is on the phone with HR saying that it&#x27;s a problem with our firewall.
 HR wanted me to join the call but I told them I didn&#x27;t have a problem statement from ADP to warrant IT involvement, but I&#x27;d investigate. I asked a few questions, gathered some errors and application behavior from HR, and then gathered some observations from some people on my team.
 Notable symptoms: people in HR couldn&#x27;t access some company personnel management features in the mobile app or web portal, users at home couldn&#x27;t access all features in the mobile app. Similar issues affecting multiple platforms on different networks.
 I informed HR via Teams that our firewall isn&#x27;t selective like that and the information gathered offers strong evidence that it&#x27;s something on ADP’s side that changed.
 Well, I was right. Sort of. Root cause? Accounts Payable failed to pay our ADP bill.

 Because of my kids schedules I drop them off and get in my office at around 7:45. Our offices don&#x27;t even open for business untill 8:30. I enjoy that time in the morning to plan my tasks for the day, finish my coffee and possibly catch the news in my feed.
 So 7:45 this morning I am fumbling with my keys to open my door juggling my gear and a half cup of coffee just trying to get in my door when one of our older office workers comes running (as much as an older lady can) to tell me about an alarm on the fire panel that is going off 
 The alarm panels are not my area, but facilities won&#x27;t be in for a while and I know my way around them, so I ask what the alarm is for. Some of our extinguishers have sensors that detect if they get used o…</span>

 Digging through the logs it was caused by slidetoshutdown.exe and upon recreating the scenario and testting with my touchscreen tablet and a test VM I was able to recreate it.
 by holding the power button on the tablet to trigger the local slidetoshutdown if you&#x27;re also full screen RDP to a Windows machine it will also launch slidetoshutdown.exe dragging that window down will shut down the remote machine.
 can&#x27;t find a gpo to disable it, not keen on replacing the exe, trying a disallow applocker rule for now.
 crazy that this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of it happening considering how easy it is to do accidentally.

 Then trying to get hiring process going this year, we’ve been hit with all kinds of starts and stops only be finally told today that they need the budget to hire some AI devs. 
 So… I need to go into my team who have been holding it together for the last 6 months and tell them things aren’t going to get better. 
 Any advice on what to say to them? Any advice on what to do to keep people sane and organized?

 ​
 My boss says it should be fine, I think &quot;everything that can go wrong will go wrong&quot; especially since the ISP does not send us a protocol for the visit but only tells the person on location what things we have to install ourselves

                              <span>I&#x27;m a systems admin for a medium-sized org, and not super familiar with AWS, but wanting to know actual best practices for the scenario below. Please forgive the inexperience behind the question:
 Basically, our Dev team is moving a lot of dependencies for their apps away from local resources and more into our cloud environment. Currently, our media team writes directly to an on-prem FTP server and the dev team pulls the data from the FTP server and loads it into an S3 bucket. We have an application that pulls the content from the S3 bucket (as far as I&#x27;m aware). 
 Our lead dev asked if there was a way to connect our local network to an S3 bucket in AWS so that we can have our media team write their stuff directly to the S3 bucket rather than the local FTP server. I&#x27;m more familiar with Azure, so I had to do some digging as to how to make this happen. My initial thought is setting up a VPN to our VPC in AWS, but I may be way off on that. However, our IT Director is on an 8-week leave, and from a strategy perspective, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the right person to make the call, as I&#x27;m still fairly new to the org.
 From what I&#x27;ve researched, there is a way to mount an S3 bucket to a local Linux server. My understanding is that the local host would act as a proxy that would eliminate the need to manually move the content into the S3 bucket.
 Am I off on this? For those who have had a similar scenario, could you please share what you did? Telling the dev team to kick rocks until our director gets back to have a more broad design discussion is not out of the question, but I figured I would do my homework before I did so.

                              <span>Hi All
 We have an rather old 2012 R2 server as our only 2012 server remaining. Rather than just creating a new VM and setting them up again is this really the best approach in 2023? We don&#x27;t currently use Azure besides 365 and nobody has P1 licenses for most Azure features.
 I&#x27;ve also seen solutions like printlogic which could be a good alternative however we also have an EFI Fiery printer. 
 ​
 Any recomendations in this modern age on best practice for servers? It&#x27;s also the first time i&#x27;ve setup a print server post print nightmare!

 Source : https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-multifactor-authentication-server-will-be-deprecated-30-september-2024/
 I only use Office 365 for mail, calendar, etc...
 Some users and in particular admin of Office 365 organization use SMS or Auth APP as 2 steps authentication.
 I don&#x27;t really understand if I&#x27;m concerned by this deprecated. Someone can give me more information ?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi guys, i have an unusual problem.
 My PKI setup (which i inherited) consists of an offline root CA, an enteprise CA and another server with IIS for the http CRL availability.
 My Root CA CRL is expiring soon so i wanted to renew it.
 What i did:
 Fired up the Root CA, published the new CRL, copied the file to my Enterprise CA, used the command
 certutil -f -dspublish Root-CA.crl
 command completed succesfully, then copied the same CRL to the web server, restarted IIS.
 What happened:
 On pkiview i see that the CDP Location2 (the http) one is ok
 the cdp location 1 (ldap location) still shows the old CRL expiring date, it looks like it didn&#x27;t renew it.
 i do this every year and last time i didn&#x27;t have any issues.
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks for the help.

Seems that it&#x27;s about 30% of one of my orgs at the moment and just seems very strange that it was a patch rolled out yesterday... I do remember seeing someone post about this before but I can&#x27;t find the post anymore.

                              <span>I am trying to get vlan working on lenovo thunderbolt dock. It is connected to tagged port passing multiple vlan and native lan using unifi switch. When i connect my Lenovo laptop or Dell xps 13 laptop I am able to use ethernet port without any issues including other features of thunderbolt port but i get connected to native vlan.
 When I go to windows and add vlan id to the network adapter, I do not get an ip assigned and it shows as unidentified network. If I had one laptop to use with the dock, I could have kept the port as untagged. I have the latest firmware on the dock along with drivers on both laptops.
 Previously i was using USB c dock and was able to use the feature without any issue. Any idea what can be the issue? Hopefully its not the dock, contains realtek ethernet port.

                              <span>Hi,
 We were having an issue with installing Feb 2023 .Net for Windows Server 2019 and also some Windows Server 2019 CU&#x27;s. Fixes that we found online included the below, none of which worked: 
  
Running sfc /scannow (never runs, always says a reboot is pending, even when we found a fix around this running sfc /scannow did nothing
 Running various DISM commands that were recommended didnt&#x27;t get us anywhere
 Tried extracting the update /cab files and installing them individually using DISM
  
My colleague found a fix which I am sharing here:
  
Take ownership of the following registry key then delete it:
  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\DriverOperations\0 2. Reboot the server - Sometimes the server will go through in percentages so let it be till it&#x27;s completed, it can take 5 or 10 minutes 3. Try installing .Net Framework again - Upon a reboot, Windows will indicate with a &quot;We couldn&#x27;t complete the updates&quot; message that it couldn&#x27;t install the update but it will continue installing it anyway 4. Install the latest CU - After a reboot it will be stuck on &quot;Working on updates: 100% Complete&quot; for 7- hours so leave the server to finish updating overnight

                              <span>Hi.
 I have a c-level user who just had his XPS motherboard replaced (2nd time in 18 months). After logging in, his Outlook, Teams and OneDrive are not connecting. Error is https://i.imgur.com/2QxOJCr.png
 The official Dell doc on this issues says to rename C:\users\\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy, then reboot. But this isn&#x27;t working. I have also renamed the other folder in that article, with no luck. 
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of googling on this issue and most responses say renaming the AAD folder above and rebooting fixed the issue.
 The TPM module is working according to powershell &quot;get-tpm&quot;. 
 Anyone got any other tips to try? The last resort seems to be re-creating the user profile.

                              <span>For our startup, we plan to provide technical support through some kind of ticketing system (necessarily free and open-source, since we are not planning to pay for Zendesk/Jira right now).
 What options can you advise if on the client side we want to see a simple window with online chat, and on our side the system with tickets, some information about the client (mail, country, etc.). If there will even be some metrics and a way to measure them - great. In general, free and more or less working analogue of Zendesk/Jira for text messaging.
 I&#x27;m thinking to do it via bot in Telegram, but I&#x27;m not sure if it will be convenient if there will be more than 100 clients.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a really strange issue with UAC and RDP for quite a while now and wondered if anyone else had come across similar
 Most of the time I&#x27;ll &#x27;Run as Administrator&#x27;, UAC prompt pops up, enter my admin credentials and no problems, same with RDP I&#x27;ll enter my credentials to login and connect in (not run as admin in that scenario, just a standard RDP process)
 However every so often with no pattern I&#x27;ll open a UAC or RDP prompt, enter my credentials and click OK and they just completely freeze up, UAC will eventually quit out after 5-10 minutes without opening anything, if I try and interact with the RDP prompt it sometimes comes up with &#x27;Credential manager UI host is not responding&#x27;
 If I simply restart my PC it all works fine for a bit again before breaking again hours/days/weeks later out of the blue
 I&#x27;ve rebuilt my PC (I say PC, it&#x27;s actually a VM) several times from scratch and it always comes back to haunt me eventually, happened with various Windows 10 builds and now I&#x27;m on Windows 11 22H2 but still the same and I&#x27;ve checked I&#x27;m fully up to date with Windows Update
 Does anyone have any ideas as it is starting to annoy me!

                              <span>Backstory:
 Previously I was a system engineer working in a devops environment, apart of sustainment and test team. I enjoyed this position because I was always learning something new, and the work was never stagnant. I ended up leaving to finish up my bachelor’s in a remote position.
 Now having completed my bachelor’s, and even before then, I have lost all motivation in this role. The overall company environment isn’t completely horrible but it is severely lacking( the people are nice). Overall the lack of job motivation has also pushed into my self learning. In my previous role, I always had the urge to self learn to stay on top of the environment I was working on.
 I feel like I’m stuck in this role. In the past few months I have had overall positive interviews but no bites. Usually because my clearance is still processing or lacked skill in one area leaving me has the “silver trophy winner”.
 Tl;dr: Current role I lost all motivation, but feel like I’m stuck

                              <span>Hi, we&#x27;re having a weird issue where some of our Windows Servers are jumping back and forth in time. 
 The worst example is one server jumping several years into the future(!) messing up our databases and applications running. Most of the servers are on vmware esxi hosts. I cant find anything in the OS logs that points to what exactly is the cause of it. Time-sync between host and VM is disabled as well. 
 ​
 From one server where it recently jumped three days into the future before reverting to the correct date and time some hours later:
 ​
 Event viewer logs Kernel-General Event ID 1:
 The system time has changed to ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎18T09:39:30.714000000Z from ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎15T00:23:08.061881200Z.
 Change Reason: An application or system component changed the time.
 ​
 No snapshots are taken in this time period that could be the trigger for the VM to synch time with its host. Has anyone seen this before or could guide me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hello all. Just got in a new batch of HP Zbook 15.6&quot; Power G9s. Out the box they are a headache. BIOS is set for PXE. Once I am in the MDT environment I have no mouse pad(this becomes a heeadache when i am doing multiple machines at a time). Biggest issue is when it starts to go through the task list, I cannot get the drivers to inject. I have loaded the laptop drivers into the deployment server, as well as the updated WinPE drivers. I have tried with both secure boot on amd secure boot off. Not sure what I am missing here. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>We’ve been using WUfB (via Intune) and the driver option but have had 2-3 issues in 6 months where released drivers cause problems with audio, cameras and docks.
 We are co managed but would prefer to use Intune and not sccm for this, so what other options are available?
 I’ve looked at commercial vantage but wonder if we would see the same issues as WUfB here, but I’d rather not go back to the days of testing an approving every other driver update if I can help it either!

                              <span>Can I ask for help here? I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m new to everything. I&#x27;ve got a problem with a HP ProLiant dl380 gen 10, it&#x27;s newly installed windows server 2022 not by me.
 There was a list of missing drivers in the device manager&#x27;s other devices category, so i tried to update via intelligent provisioning. There were no errors in the update proccess and after.
 But after i reboot, it wants me to plug in two power supplies, so i did and the amber blinking sign on health disappeared. But when i go back to intelligent provisioning, it shows self update and then it says error while loading shared libraries. 
 How do I fix this? https://i.imgur.com/PcV0Dse.jpg https://i.imgur.com/nvgrGOu.jpg

                              <span>Hi all. Just wondering if anyone is aware of a way to add existing devices to the OEM listing for AutoPilot? I was looking to push DFCI settings via Intune, but our devices are from Dell but all enrolled manually (Hardware Hash uploads), or by converting Hybrid devices, so the DFCI isn&#x27;t available to us direct. We have access to things such as the TechDirect setup at Dell, so wondering if there&#x27;s a way to &#x27;confirm&#x27; device ownership to allow this?
 Long shot and not the end of the world if it doesn&#x27;t work, but I thought worth asking!

                              <span>We have 4 office buildings dotted around a yard, currently using Netgear Orbi 6E but due to the fact the buildings are more than wifi range apart (though connected by wired LAN) the satellite nodes cannot communicate with the primary gateway node. That means I can&#x27;t update them in place, I have to disconnect them and bring them into the same building to run updates. I think it&#x27;s also causing satellites to inexplicably stop working every few months until they&#x27;re restarted.
 Is there any 6E mesh system which doesn&#x27;t mind if the nodes can&#x27;t talk to each other over wifi? I&#x27;d really have expected just being on the same wired LAN would have been okay with the Orbi but no such luck. I don&#x27;t really mind if it&#x27;s consumer, the Orbi experience is very consumer despite being marketed to businesses. Wifi is secondary to ethernet in our offices, I just want a system that doesn&#x27;t require frequent manual interventions.

                              <span>Hi
 One of our servers, running Windows Server 2016 Standard, is having issues communicating with our Domain Controller (same OS).
 DNS is fine, with all the usual ping tests showing no issues:
 Ping server
 Ping example.local
 Ping server.example.local
 Signing into the problematic server is intermittently slow, with the following error messages being present:
 The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2/2611a202-62d5-4d03-923f-feb1cf81e719/EXAMPLE.local 
 with error code &quot;There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)&quot;. --- The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 ldap/SERVER.EXAMPLE.local/EXAMPLE.local@EXAMPLE.LOCAL 
 with error code &quot;There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)&quot;.
 I believe we have isolated it to the security update KB5011233 - after uninstalling and rebooting the server on Friday, it worked fine; however it was reinstalled over the weekend and the issue is now recurring.
 I&#x27;ve looked online and tried a few fixes, but so far aside from uninstalling the update, I haven&#x27;t been able to fix this.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

                              <span>Hello Guys,
 I come to you to get some advise and opinions, maybe some insight, on who should be the owner of a shared folder. We had the issue this morning with someone who didn&#x27;t have access since we couldn&#x27;t properly re-inherit the permissions to the subfolders.
 The issue was that some folders were owned by User A, Creator of some subfolders, and not by User B, Owner of the Main shared folder.
 Normally it looks something like this. See picture below.
 Imgur Picture
 In my experience the Owner usually is the local Administrator or the group &quot;Domain Admin&quot;. For now we have put &quot;Domain Users&quot; and we have added each user (not like on the picture) manually. Meaning that we don&#x27;t yet work with an AD group that gets assigned to each user for access instead of each user is manually added.
 So my question is the following. Is it ok to leave &quot;Domain Users&quot; as owners or should be put &quot;Domain Admins&quot;? Is it maybe a security issue or cause other problems? It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve done it myself and I don&#x27;t remember who I put as owner on those cases.

If i put the same setting static IP ect in the old Motorola MC9190 (We are trying to replace the old Motorola with the Zebra) they connect right away and can use the AS400 emulation app with no issues. 
 Started a couple weeks ago and driving me nuts. Anyone else use these scanners?

                              <span>On multiple occasions now the threat policies that you define in the security center have malfunctioned heavily. We have tested this heavily, let&#x27;s say we have three outbound spam policies:
 ​
 - No Send Limit (Unlimited)
 - Test Send Limit (5)
 - Default Policy (500)
 ​
 1) Scoped a user to policy &quot;Test Send Limit&quot; and sent out 50 mails. User was restricted from sending in the Security Portal and an alert was triggered. But mails could be sent out half a day later without problems and the user was still blocked in the portal.
 2) Scoped a user to policy &quot;No Send Limit&quot;. Multiple days passed, so enough time was given for the policy to be active in M365. Suddenly, user was restricted after sending out 500 mails as if the default policy applied. This can never be because the default policy has the lowest priority and therefore explicit policies always take precedence.
 ​
 This was raised as a ticket at Microsoft and escalated and I did supply them lots of information over multiple weeks. I never got the resolution to the problem and at some point they just stopped answering my mails.

                              <span>Hello
 Since OD / SharePoint Online has been introduced in this company there has been a weird problem around.
 If I upload a file about 500MB or bigger to the cloud, synchronize it&#x27;s directory to my local storage and then try to open it, I get the error &quot;the rpc server is unavailable&quot;.
 The second try it always works and I&#x27;ve already checked/tried the following points:
 · Firewall
 · Tried different networks
 · Checked that the following services are up &amp; running: -Remote Procedure Call (RPC), RPC Endpoint Mapper &amp; DCOM Server Process Launcher
 · ipconfig /flushdns
 · Can&#x27;t trace the network traffic because OD&#x27;s traffic is encrypted
 The problem affects all clients in the company and I&#x27;ve never had it in any other OD/SharePoint environment, is anyone familiar with the issue and may even know the cause / a solution?
 Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

 The value had changed to &quot;Microsoft managed&quot; in our case because we had disabled it before 5/17. Now that it&#x27;s been set again it sounds like it will stick, but this was pretty sneaky. We disabled it in order to shunt people to the full Microsoft Authenticator, which has a couple other key features.
 ​
  
Updated May 17, 2023: Today we are starting rollout for Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) to enter GA! The Microsoft managed value of this feature will be changed from ‘disabled’ to ‘enabled’ on June 9th. We have made some changes to the feature configuration, so if you made an update before GA (5/17), please validate that the feature is in the correct state for your tenant prior to June 9th. If you do not wish for this feature to be enabled on June 9th, move the state to ‘disabled’ or set users to include and exclude groups.
  
Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) is a feature that allows your users to complete multi-factor authentication for their work or school account using Outlook on their iOS or Android device. This feature will be enabled on June 9th for all tenants that have not disabled it. If you do not wish for this feature to be enabled on June 9th, move the state to ‘disabled’ or set user include and exclude groups prior to June 9th.

                              <span>On our network we have partnered with a local PD. Basically we have a campus in a high crime area. Local PD approached us about tapping into outdoor cameras to have live viewing (Decision is made and way above my pay grade). I walked into the network we have and I am in the process to make it better.
 Basically the PD uses a third party (FUSUS) that goes on our network and has access to certain cameras over IP and a read user of the camera. Device needs internet access and access to 5-6 specific cameras.
 I plan to put the device on an &quot;Unmanaged Device&quot; subnet/vlan add policies to our firewalls as well as acls at the switch level. Anything else I can do to help?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 There is a quite a bit of fuzz regarding full stack network engineers and their demand in future. Can someone guide on what exactly we need to be equipped with in order to be one?

                              <span>I can&#x27;t seem to get this lab working,which I am doing to simulate an upcoming deployment with a client in Manhattan,I have a switch connecting to a Nexus pair on VPC.On Nexus side-I have VPC obviously and it&#x27;s just access ports in VLAN 100,On the Non-Nexus switch-I created a port-channel,did no switchport,and created a sub-interface on the port channel like int port-channel 11.100,Gave it an IP address,and associated 2 links to this port-channel again with the same &quot;no switchport&quot; .Port channel looks to be Up when I do etherchannel summary,but when I try pinging this VLAN 100 sub-interface IP from the Nexus switch on which I have a SVI for VLAN 100,I am unable to ping,What could be the reason ? Is this even allowed because I read somewhere VPC doesn&#x27;t support L3.

                              <span>I have 3 different network racks in different buildings that are in desperate need of some love. Over the years the cables have gotten tangled together and looped around so much that I can barely get my hands in there to unplug them from the switch, let alone try and pull the cable and trace it back to the patch-panel. 
 The one that is my main priority has over used 300 switchports and 11x 48-port patch-panels. There are 2 racks, one with 6 patches on the top half and the other with 5 patches on the top and switches on the bottom half. There are cable organizers on the racks but they are overflowing and literally will not fit a single cable more.
 I have never taken on something of this scale before so I want to make sure I&#x27;m not getting in over my head.
 What has been your guys&#x27; experience? Any tips and tricks for tackling this problem?

 Has anyone faced the same/similar issues?

 This company is managing around 2000 customer and has been operating for 10 years.
 To me it seems like a really big deal.
 But I am not sure how to address this to my boss or superior.
 I just joined and starting to peaking faults at the very beginning doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea but again I can&#x27;t overlook the security risk.
 How should I proceed ?

 Connect failed:(30044) No available encryption algorithms match with the server
 I know the security implication, but we are going to slowly upgrade all the machines.
 In the meantime, do you know of any workaround? I usually use Putty and allow weaker cipher/algorithms, but I can&#x27;t find the way on Cattools.

 So we have a new site setup and it&#x27;s up, no users yet in the site.
 We have a couple of PCs setup for testing and are planning to test application performance on the PCs over the network 
 What tools are available for this and does anyone have any experience in doing this?
 What else do we have to test? (I&#x27;m sure everything will be fine anyways since there won&#x27;t be too many users initially and total users will still be 500-600 max for the site in the long term but still need to test).
 We have 3750 switches as access switches which are temporary (will be replaced by 9300s when they arrive). And nexus 9k switches as core in a Cisco 2-tier deployment with 2 gig redundant links back to the data center (which is like 10 miles away).
 Edit: can iperf be used for stress testing?
 Thank you

 We currently use Clover as our PCI compliant pen testing that our bank states we must use but from my experience they are extremely terrible. Does anyone have any advice on a good pen testing company to check out? I was think Nessus or maybe Rapid7.

                              <span>Does anyone have any good resources for best practices on a outdoor IP camera topology design? We are running into issues today with being able to reliable provide connectivity to cameras in large parking lots or fields (multiple acres). 
 Cameras installed on the exterior of the building are fine as we can home run them to our MDF/IDFs and the distance are typically under 100m. Where we run into issues is with our PTZ cameras on the outer part of the property which are typically over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF. Additionally, these cameras for the most part have a 60w/90w PoE requirement. 
 While each camera is over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF they are sometimes within 100m of a few neighboring cameras on poles/property edge. 
 We&#x27;ve gone down the rabbit hole of ethernet extenders, PoE extenders, fiber converters with PoE injectors, P2P wireless systems (separate from our wireless deployment), and they all are hit or miss. 
 Should we be looking a ring topology and deploying small outdoor PoE switches on the pole and connect as many cameras as we can, and the daisy chain of that switch via fiber to the next one? Or should we deploy a couple of edge switches in NEMA cabinets on the ground and feed as many cameras as we can from them?
 Appreciate any insight, experience, or resources anyone has for a situation like this.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t found anything definitive on the internet and it bothers me. 
 2 different ISP lines are plugged into a switch (HP Procurve). 2 more ports on that same switch go to the router. The router is programmed with the static IPs for the two ISPs and it just works. There are no VLANS setup and in fact no management at all done on the switch.
 Why does this work without any VLANs setup on the switch and router?
 Is there any concerns with this setup.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Sorry if this is an oddly specific post, but I didn&#x27;t see a sub for Dell Networking, and the SNMP sub seems to be dead. If there is a sub for this kind of question, I&#x27;d love to check it out. I&#x27;ve made a post on the Dell forum without any success.
 In the process of implementing IPv6 on my university network, I&#x27;m trying log IPv6 Neighbor Table entries via SNMP, to have records available indicating which host had which IPv6 address. I&#x27;ve been able to query my Cisco switches without a problem, and can get the desired IPv4 data from the Dell switches (I&#x27;m also doing ARP tables), but the IPv6 queries are returning unusable data.
 When querying IPV6-MIB::ipv6NetToMediaNetAddress using snmpwalk, I get the message No Such Object available on this agent at this OID.
 When querying IPV6-MIB…</span>

 question! so i currently work in film and 2.4 is massively busy. for this reason i have taken my opted to not allow the 2.4 band to be used when connecting to my ubiquity AP&#x27;s. 
 will my aps even though they&#x27;re not using 2.4 still causing interference with other devices on the same 2.4 channel?

 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m currently working in a dual role as a Network Security Engineer and Network Engineer, and I hold CCNP Enterprise (ENARSI), CCNP Security (SNCF), and CCSE - Checkpoint certifications. My daily work involves dealing with Checkpoint, ASA, FMC, as well as Cisco routers and switches. I come from a smaller country where complex routing needs seem to be dwindling as many networks are transitioning to firewall-focused designs, with exceptions for configurations like DMVPN.
 Both network security and routing are areas that I am passionate about, but I&#x27;m at a crossroads in terms of my career progression. My daily tasks involve a lot of security-related work, but the routing experience I&#x27;m gaining is mainly limited to BGP. I&#x27;m continuously reading documentation, learning, and lab…</span>

 I am going to Cisco Live in Las Vegas and have signed up for the CCT (Cisco Certified Technician) exam.
 Have been working with networking for about 6 years and feel like I have a good knowledge in the field, but I guess there is still a lot of exam specific things I should look into before going. 
 Does anyone have recommendations to content that could be helpful for this?

                              <span>Hi guys. A few years ago I bought a crimping tool which worked great. I&#x27;m wanting to go through my cables now and replace with cat 6.
 So I bought the cable and some pass through connectors as I heard they were easier, None of the cables I made worked so I looked back at the advert for the tool and it says not compatible with cat 6, I&#x27;ve now read they are thicker with staggered connectors. Am I ok to carry on using the tool I have with cat 5e rj45 connectors but cat 6 cable as I don&#x27;t need the full 10gbs. I was just going to buy another crimping tool but most of the Amazon adverts say they are suitable for all sizes but how can they be if the Cat 6 ones are staggered 🤔 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Got a customer in the process of migrating from their On-prem file server to SharePoint. They use Adobe Acrobat pretty extensively and would like to use the Adobe SharePoint online integration so they can save directly to SharePoint locations from Adobe. I&#x27;ve created a custom MSI installer with the Acrobat customisation wizard and got that working to enable the custom Adobe save and open experience.
 Wondering if there is a way to add SharePoint sites using this tool or a registry edit so that the SharePoint site file storage locations/accounts are preconfigured on install.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hey fellow Redditors,
 I&#x27;m currently leading a project in my mid-sized organization, where we&#x27;re undergoing a transition from Slack to Teams. The project was assigned to me recently, and we have a tight timeline of just 2 months to complete the transition. 
 However, the company has historically been resistant to change, and some executives have already expressed concerns about the switch. As a relatively new member of the company, I don&#x27;t have much experience with Slack, but I&#x27;ve been entrusted with leading this transition.
 While I believe that people just need time to adjust to the new system, I wanted to reach out to the community for advice. 
 Are there any important considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of during this transition period? My goal is to ensure a seamless migration and minimize any disruptions to our workflow.
 Additionally, I&#x27;m curious to learn about the similarities and differences in features between Teams and Slack. Are there any features that exist in both platforms? Furthermore, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate any insights into unique features offered by Slack that may not be available in Teams.
 Thank you in advance for your guidance and insights!

 I&#x27;m hoping that someone might be able to help point me in the direction of a solution because I&#x27;m stumped.
 Short background: I work in K-12 and our previous systems admin left for a new job a few months ago. His position was vacant (though his assignments were distributed across a few different people) until roughly a month ago when I was offered the spot. I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to server hardware and RAID configurations in practice, but I understand the theory. This was all understood by my senior leadership before they offered me this job and we all understand I am learning this through trial by fire. 
 The situation: Last week we get a work order from a remote site that users can&#x27;t access their site&#x27;s server. The …</span>

                              <span>From what I&#x27;ve read, pts devices are SSH or telnet connections. This is my personal laptop, and I have no expectation of this being used.
 In the output of who -a I see:
 pts/5  6650 id&#x3D;ts/5 term&#x3D;0 exit&#x3D;2
 When I look in /dev/pts I expected to see 5, but there is only 0 - 4 and ptmx.
 When I run fuser /dev/pts/5 the output is 6823, but every time I run this the number changes for the process so I can&#x27;t figure out which process is using pts/5.
 Here are my questions: - How do I figure out what process is using pts/5? - should I be concerned about this since it is mostly used with ssh or telnet.

                              <span>I worked for a company for eight years, reported to the CFO, and was promoted to Director of IT during that time. Then the company brought in a CIO and 3 months later I was let go because according to her I wasn&#x27;t on board with her plans. I had previously gone to HR stating that in those 3 months I had 3 meetings with her, was being cut out of all other meetings/planning, and had NO idea what was going on.
 I am now filling out an employment history for a new job and they want my previous supervisors contact info. Should I refer to the one that was my boss for 7+ years or the one for 3 months?
 Your opinions are appreciated.

                              <span>My ex boss was horrible. No one in the organization that I talked to liked him. One person on our team, maybe, because he got away with doing next to nothing.
 I don’t know the whole story but he resigned and we already have a replacement who’s sooo much better, more organized, more engaged, more communicative, more experienced… it’s like a night and day difference. 
 Now I feel the need to explain why shits all f’d up to the new boss. I sent him a list of job duties and started it with “I haven’t been able to do my actual job for 6+ months” because I’ve been forced to cover helpdesk and other areas that aren’t supposed to fall to me. I’m honestly embarrassed by the state of things.

                              <span>I work for a company with an IT team and a cloud operations team... the lines between both are pretty blurry.
 Is this common? - it just doesnt make much sense to me... I always think one team and having people specialise makes more sense... i.e. if an &quot;IT&quot; person can help with a cloud issue or a &quot;Cloud&quot; person can help with an IT issue.

                              <span>Do this…
 Create a MS Teams meeting for the time you want to be left alone and invite yourself.
 Join the meeting. It will just be you in the meeting, but to the rest of the world it will show you are on a call. A very “important” call.
 Take it a step further and screen share a random application window. Maybe just a Notepad with nothing on it.
 Your status will go into presenting mode thus indicating you are mega busy.
 Probably works for Zoom and stuff too. Using Cisco Jabber with presence enabled and also picks up that you are busy on a call.

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting onboarded to be the senior admin at a small company as the existing admin is set to retire soon. They sell software which basically consists of a desktop app (office workers) and a mobile app (field works) with a back end in SQL.
 Most all our customers are small as well without dedicated IT depts. So if a customer chooses, our company will host their SQL &amp; Web Server in a cloud VM, give it a public IP, and let the mobile app and desktop apps connect there rather than the customer hosting it themselves.
 Last week, I was being shown how we buy and license SQL for a new implementation. The guy showed me we get SQL standard and enough CALs to cover each office user, plus one CAL to cover every mobile user, because the app connects to a web server first, then to the SQL server, so SQL would never know that there&#x27;s multiple app users.
 Granted MS licensing is convoluted, but this is not how I understand CALs. Every mobile user, even though the app is connecting to a middleware, needs a CAL right? Yet this is how they&#x27;ve sold their software for the past few years.
 Not sure exactly what to do now that I&#x27;ve seen this? Bringing it to the attention of owners potentially puts a target on me as overstepping and being a threat to their business model? I&#x27;m not even sure how to bring something like this up. Usually big problems are things that are visible like failed hardware. Owners might say &quot;It works - I don&#x27;t see the issue&quot; and I don&#x27;t blame them - it&#x27;s hard to understand.
 Fixing it and just eating the license cost could be difficult given this company&#x27;s size. Re-quoting customers that have been live for years on our software telling them they&#x27;re not compliant seems equally impossible. Yet this is my living and I kinda need the company to do well so that I can do well. I feel like I&#x27;ve walked into a time bomb that was impossible to see from the outside.

                              <span>I have a member of staff who is new to IT doing L1 work. They talk a good game but are lazy with failure to complete simple tasks fully, they constantly watch YouTube videos and suddenly minimise when I walk by but often too late so I can clearly see what they are up to and when I try to explain a task fully they constantly interrupt and don’t start talking about something totally irrelevant to the task. 
 It’s also coupled with 30 minute trips to the toilet that I cannot ignore as the bathroom is opposite my desk. 
 How would you deal with this individual, ideally I would like to replace them with someone who actually cares. 
 I have notified HR but need to gather a good approach to this too.

                              <span>Context: I&#x27;m a site leader with 20+ years of experience in the field. I’m working through a medium-complex unix script issue. I have gone DND on Teams to stop all the popups in the corner of my screen while I focus on the task. This is something I’m very capable of dealing with; I just need everyone to go away for 20 mins.
 Phone call comes through to the office.
 Manager: Hi, what’s the problem?
 Me: Sorry? Problem?
 Manager: Why have you gone DND on Teams?
 Me: I’m working through an issue and don’t need the constant pop ups. It&#x27;s distracting.
 Manager: Well you shouldn’t do that.
 Me: I’m sorry…
 Manager: I need to you to be available at all times.
 Me: I am available, I’m just busy.
 Manager: I don’t want anyone on DND. It looks bad.
 Me: What? It looks bad? For whom?
 Manager: For anyone that wants to contact you. Looks like you’re ignoring them.
 Me: Well at this moment in time I am ignoring them, I’m busy with this thing that needs fixing.
 Manager: Turn off DND. What if someone needs to contact you urgently?
 Me: Then they can phone me, like you’re doing now.
 Manager: … … just turn off DND.
 ... middle micro managers: desperate to know everyone&#x27;s business at any given moment just in case there&#x27;s something they don&#x27;t know about and they can weigh in with some non-relevant ideas. I bet this comes up in next weeks team meeting.

                              <span>Teams on Android is usually pretty stable and straightforward so it&#x27;s surprising to see this issue. Even MS support, from my continued discussions with them, is baffled.
 Essentially, we got a user reporting that he doesn&#x27;t have the option to select Bluetooth from the list of output devices. He just sees device and speaker. Issue started back in April.
 We can confirm the following with the user:
  
On a recent BYOD Android device -- Galaxy S22 Ultra running Android 13.
 We have no MDM in place to enforce a certain version of the app.
 Headset is a Sony WH-1000XM4.
 Can confirm the headset is detected and functional in other apps, e.g. YouTube, Audio Recorder, and Phones.
 Tried a cache clear through system settings and the Android settings itself.
 Tried a reinstall of Teams from the app store.
  
Not really sure why this would be happening and MS support feels the same way too.
 I&#x27;m thinking about having the user download an older version of Teams. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, all.
 So I&#x27;m new to cloud support and our workflow is mostly in managing the server of our clients. Sometimes, we have a new client and they want to migrate their files from their current server to their new server(where we set-up and manage).
 My question is what is the best scripting language to compare old files to new files. The software we use is filezilla and sometimes filezilla doesn&#x27;t fully transfer the files especially if it&#x27;s a folder within a folder. But the main thing here is what is a good scripting language to compare files (size disk) &amp; (contains) from old server to new. Because I checked the files manually and it&#x27;s taking much time. 
 Thank you everyone.

                              <span>SOLVED: Thanks, now I know it is a power issue with SFP.
 Hey folks,
 Quick question. Setting up some cabling (up to 45m of cable) which I plan to with two 10GbE NICs. Thinking of going with SFP+ slots for possible future fiber upgrade.
 Noticed something though: SFP+ modules seem to indicate a range limit, usually 30m or 80m max. Is this a SFP+ thing? Or do regular NICs have this too, but just don&#x27;t advertise it?
 It was my expectation that with a normal 10GbE RJ45 NIC and proper cat6a under 100 meters, 10GbE links could be established. Now I have doubts about that being a thing or just a theoretical limit which are not feasible with normal NICs (and them just working under 30m too or something similar).
 Any advice, insight or recommendations would be awesome.
 Cheers!

 I can see multicast (osp traffic) across their link. We can also see MACs across it. But it won&#x27;t support pinging a host across the network.
 I&#x27;ve been struggling to imagine what could be the issue. Best I&#x27;ve got is some kind of vlan issue in their network allowing layer 2 and BUM traffic but no unicast.
 We got them to finally attempt to test unicast rraffic after days of them saying it was our issue. Of course they weren&#x27;t able to pass unicast traffic either and are investigating where the issue is

                              <span>Hi r/networking!
 I&#x27;m a junior sysadmin/hobbyist working on a script and ansible suite for managing an automated lab infrastructure in a VMWare environment and am now looking for some input on E-W traffic design! (Preliminary note: As of current design, for any edge router 1-8 internal firewall &#x27;zones&#x27; can be implemented and any one internal firewall &#x27;zone&#x27; can be a mirrored DMZ of an internal zone. Any firewall in turn can manage 8 different portgroups connected to an arbitrary amount of hosts. All backdoor management is through an isolated private vlan.)
 In the first image I&#x27;ve connected the edge router to two portgroups, one for internal traffic and one for dmz traffic. Any firewall-router belonging to one of these two categories would be connected to one of these two portgroupps. https://snipboard.io/oSHWN5.jpg
 In the second image all firewall-routers have been isolated to their own portgroup, connected in turn to the edge-router. https://snipboard.io/oIU4r1.jpg
 My question is: What would be best practice with consideration of system internal traffic and separation of duties? Would you want the edge router to route internal east-west traffic if it delegated to different firewalls? Or would you want them on a shared &#x27;uplink&#x27; portgroup and subnet and do the east-west traffic by themselves? Spontaneously I&#x27;d say that the edge-router should primarily be concerned with North-South and internal traffic is to be managed on the internal firewalls, but then again, I have little to no experience. Would these be easier to manage as well rather than muddying the waters to have the firewalls do *some* firewalling in regards to internal EW traffic and the edge router do *some* of that as well?
 I appreciate any input and thanks for reading. :)

                              <span>Hiya! :)
  
 Basically if you browse reddit and you have a plan of 8GB/mo - you use the alloted data. But if you browse facebook - you don&#x27;t use anything from your plan.
  
 It&#x27;s pretty stupid what they do considering social networks alongside youtube are largest bandwidth takers, but whatever. Are there any creative solutions to let&#x27;s say browse reddit this way?

                              <span>Hello ! 
 I would like toigrate my data from Helpscout to Freshdesk, and i found this website : https://help-desk-migration.com.
 But no pay to 4000 euros when I could do the same via integromat ( Make) and the right call.
 Is there someone that already done it and therefore would have kind of a list of the equivalents fields between freshdesk and helpscout by any chance ? 
 It would be amazing ! Thanks for your help !

 I have a user with an almost full mailbox, I’ve gone ahead and applied a retention policy to his mailbox to move his mail going forward. However I need to move mail from some large sub folders in his inbox to the In-Place Archive folder and break it up by a date range (2021,2022)etc..Does anyone have a good way to do this via powershell.

                              <span>Context: an email migration was done to Office 365(exchange online).
 I set up a user with the outlook mobile app on their phone. They report however that emails only start to populate in the outlook app on the phone after opening the outlook desktop app that is profiled on a machine we have for the user. I have not been able to see this in action. Initially I thought it might have been the focused view. Turned that off and confirmed that emails were no longer missing. However, the user is reporting this happening again. I checked exchange properties and confirmed active sync is enabled and even detects the phone that is set up. Just posting here in case I am missing something to check or if y’all have run into this before. My guess is that it’s something with the client(mobile phone) as I have set up other users on their mobile phones and similar reports have not been heard. Thanks in advance for any advice/commentary. Just a bit paranoid is all since it’s a very important user.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking about switching jobs and I&#x27;d like to understand where I stand in the marketplace.
 I&#x27;ve been working for 2.5 years (first tech job) as a &quot;Software Support Engineer&quot; at a small content management system company. We host a lot of clients&#x27; CMS applications and websites in our private clouds.
 My role entails daily work with clients who submit user knowledge tickets as well as report software issues with the CMS product and site implementations built by our developers. We do not have any tiered support so I handle whatever issue, regardless of complexity. I also do product QA, UAT and delivery, and very often spin up VMs for new client or internal development environments, set up websites and services, etc. (DNS, load balancer configurations, headers, VPNs, FTP, etc)

                              <span>With all this talk of &quot;outlook isn&#x27;t your ERP/CRM/file repository&quot;... 
 What is the right software for a 6-7 person project-based business? 
 We currently use a very small collection of sharepoint lists tied to a power-automate app to create template project folders/files in our teams/onedrive environment + project tracking using Microsoft Planner (all to varying levels of commitment to the digital system depending on the employee). Outlook basically handles all the rest of our customer interaction tracking.
 I have been casually looking at Odoo or Netsuite with the thought of doing a slow rollout myself starting with my projects and slowly rolling out to the other 5 employees. But this is so far down my list I wouldn&#x27;t even say its totally on my radar. 
 That being said, if outlook is moving toward this &quot;new&quot; view, with all of those features missing, this may move way up my priorities list.

 Trouble is I&#x27;m 56, but I don&#x27;t feel it and many people are surprised when the find out. I&#x27;m looking for IT Manager roles in a larger organisation. Would anyone even consider me at that age. I&#x27;m in Yorkshire, in the UK, if that helps.

                              <span>I work for an MSP, with my title being Jr SysAdmin. It’s a completely unearned title, given that most of my day to day is typical help desk shenanigans, but my position is unique in that 90% of the company does remote work, 9.9% does on-site onboarding/infrastructure building, and I’m part of the 0.1% (as in ~3 people) who works on-site full time for a client.
 Well, the client wants to end the contract. CTO is a paranoid fuck and never wanted to give the keys up to any of his systems for us to work with, one of the reasons I was told is because I’m not part of their ethnoreligious group, so I’m considered an “outsider”. Fine, whatever. But everyone else at the client loves me. I get great customer feedback, my metrics are great, and even my supervisors are always singing my praises because of all the on-site techs they’ve sent in the past, I’m the only one who’s stuck around and been consistently good at the job.
 So the contract is up June 30th, and my company informed me that they won’t be keeping me on past that. They’re going to let me go despite a perfect record. I’m assuming it’s because I make $60k a year for what’s basically a glorified help desk, but I digress. 
 I don’t know why I’m writing this to be honest, I’m just frustrated as hell. I’m a Marine Corps Reservist, so that makes finding a civilian job harder. This also comes right after I signed off on a new apartment, and I have 3 weeks worth of obligations family/military wise in August. Fucking wish I never did IT, this shit blows.

                              <span>Hey folks, I have over 5 years as a sysadmin at my current job and over 10 years in total experience, also have several certs.
 With all the layoffs happening right now, I&#x27;m wondering if its safer to stay at my current company or jump. I feel like its very possible we may have layoffs coming next year and I know a lot of companies do layoffs by &quot;last in first out&quot;
 I feel like if I jumped jobs I could make way more money (like a lot more, probably 50% more), but not sure if that would open me up to less stability. I live in LCOL so while more money would def be nice, I&#x27;m not dying or anything. I also work 100% remote and am not open to anything not 100% remote. I feel like there isn&#x27;t much room for advancement at current co, but the job is relatively chill most days and the benefits are good. Current co does offer decent severance also from what I&#x27;ve heard if layoffs did happen.
 I feel like I probably want to jump eventually but not sure if the timing is right. Would suck to change cos, then they announce massive layoffs and you&#x27;re the first to be let go, since they just hired you. Any advice would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hi,
 I have 1 dedicated Windows 2019 DHCP server on a intranet setup. Sometime yesterday, my DHCP server is being flooded with BAD_ADDRESS entries. My clients are connected via lan port and no wireless connectivity is enabled. 
 Have tried removing the BAD_ADDRESS entries but they keep coming back almost immediately after deletion. 
 What could be the possible cause?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are experiencing issues with all the Macs that we updated to Ventura.
 Users are connecting via SMB (2.1 and 3.1.1) to our main fileserver (Server 2019) because we have a mixed Windows/Mac environment.
 This have been performed pretty well last years. But after upgrading several Macs to Ventura all the users with Ventura complaining about very poor performance with Quick preview. Sometimes it takes 20s to load a 20kb image. 
 Opening the file is not a problem and the image is loaded instantly, but the preview is not responding well.
 When the same users are working on our Archive server (Synology NAS) with SMB, they are having no issues.
 We even reinstalled several devices, but no luck. All the Monterey are not having any issues.
 I can’t find anything on the internet that may help resolve our issue. Hopefully someone here has the golden tip.

 My company is going to lay off people due to &quot;other companies are doing it, too&quot; amongst some other bullshit. I worked my ass off as a Sys Admin. Supporting 15+ apps, most without any training or good documentation. No promotion for me or my peers in years except people overseas (i work in the US). I&#x27;m brushing up my resume and started looking for another job. So, if/when i do get the boot what are some things to ask or do concerning the exit? Thank you in advance if i don&#x27;t get to reply to your comment.

                              <span>Hi,
 So for some reason a department thought it was a great idea to include a 4.8Mb .gif file in their mail signature. This results in their emails being huge and it is quickly becoming an issue (no big surprise)
 Obviously we will send out a mail telling everyone yo not use any sort of .gif or .webm in their mails. At least not as attachments.
  
 So my question is, is anyone blocking something like this? Would,it make sense to block .gif in mails if they are abive 250Kb or something? Any other suggestions.

                              <span>Greetings,
 One of the healthcare Mobile apps used by Doctors provides instant messaging and voice services and some clinical notifications via integration to or EHR servers. All servers (App and EHR) are located in our premises in the internal segment, and we publish one port (xmpp) to the internet where the mobile app connects to.
 When doctors are at home, the mobile app gets instant messages only, no voice capabilities are enabled over the internet, as this is a regulatory compliance thing. 
 On premise, as standard security practice, all doctors personal mobile devices are in guest WiFi vlan, isolated from the internal resources. There is a requirement to open up the guest Wi-Fi vlan to the mobile app servers in the internal segment to enable voice services. Now I’m totally against this, and the mobile app does support any MAM integrations, but would like to understand how admins deal with and secure access to similar business mobile apps.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to run containers simply like using Docker but safely using virtualization while keeping it performant as possible.
 I came across to two project that caught my attention:
 a) KataContainers
 b) Firecracker
 But I&#x27;m really confused about how they work, what are the differences and what is more performant. Would appreciate if anyone help me to clarify that.
 KataContainers looks simple. You can easily configure it as Docker container runtime. If I understand correctly, firecracker-containerd enables you to do the same as Kata, right? If so, what are the differences between them? What are pros and cons? In what cases should be one used over another? Which one is more performant?

                              <span>We recently had a drive failure (nothing lost, just annoying) and want to step up our monitoring game so we can get drives replaced before they fail.
 Right now were using telegraf and grafana, but I&#x27;m wondering if there are other solution out there.
 Some googling came up with Zabbix as a possibility.

Dang phones won’t renew their lease automatically when the re-auth period hits and have to be rebooted…I’m over it all.

                              <span>Hey all, I have recently been trying to dig myself out of the MSP space and into an internal position. I have recently been offered a job at a company where I would be the sole IT provider for location with 55+ people. Doing minimal server and Networking and help desk tickets.
 I currently work at MSP doing level two and three work. Maybe getting a promotion in the next year and was just approved for a pretty big raise. I&#x27;m not sure if this would be beneficial to my career so I was hoping to get some insight. 
 New job:
 Pros:
 * Not an MSP
 * 20k pay increase
 * Seems to be within my wheelhouse
 * Ownership of IT things ( Not MSP) 
 Cons:
 * Only IT for that office. No team or boss to bounce ideas off of. Not getting a great collaborative feeling from the remote IT team
 * Will be doing EVERYTHING. Powerpoints to network troubleshooting
 * Might be a step down technically speaking
 * No Work from home whatsoever. 
 Current job:
 Pros:
 * Job security
 * Great boss and team
 * I know what I&#x27;m doing, no learning curve.
 * Completely remote 
 Cons:
 * Overworked
 * Pay could be better
 * Feeling stagnant. 
 This would be the perfect position if I knew I had a good team and boss and had the chace to work from home some. I&#x27;m itching to get out of the MSP World and this is the first thing that&#x27;s come my way in a long time.

 www.company.com potato.company.com
 Need to set up a 3rd site with domain:
 test.potato.company.com
 If I simply create a new zone called &quot;potato.company.com&quot; and add &quot;test&quot; sub domain to it, Then potato.company.com stops working.
 What is the proper way of setting this up in windows dns server ?

                              <span>Hey guys, was wondering if such a thing exists and if so if there’s any recommendations from the great community of r/sysadmin for a platform that can host powershell scripts to execute on command for end user machines? Currently I have a lot of scripts on my laptop which I then manually enter the machine hostname for, and then enter the creds to authenticate on and I kinda want something a bit more streamlined

 The practice that I work for has expressed a few times that it would be nice if I were to get certified as a PACS admin, and, when talking with their CEO he was speaking really highly of the PMP and said he would be willing to sign off on my hourly requirement. 
 For perspective, I have 2 years of experience. My sole goal is to make as much money as I can by being as valuable as I can, while also not working 90 hours a week. I&#x27;m not in it for me. I don&#x27;t need a new car or a nice watch. I just want to provide for my children. 
 Outside of &quot;depends what you are interested in&quot;, which direction would make me the most marketable/valuable?

 I’ve verified that it has the proper mic selected, but can’t seem to solve issue. 
 Anyone else experienced this?

                              <span>So I work at a very small msp that is growing rapidly. We currently bill hourly but are transitioning into contracts. We are also kinda new to M365.
 Our Linux team has a ton of monitoring tools that greatly increased their efficiency and i was wondering if something like that exists for m365 based software. Both tenant wide and maybe service based? Like getting a warning when user A is nearly running out of space on outlook or user B uploading an ungodly amount of files to OneDrive or something like that. Do tools like that exist?

                              <span>After 7 months of demanding another member of staff, I finally accepted I was just being strung along and it was all smoke and mirrors.
 Last year the response was &quot;We just need to figure where they fit into the team&quot;
 This year it was &quot;We are looking into it&quot; followed by &quot;We realise another member of staff is needed&quot; followed by &quot;The stats don&#x27;t support it&quot;.
 All patching is falling on me as well as DR&#x27;s, whilst getting complained at as an infrastructure engineer that the 1st line queue is a mess. I try to escalate stuff to my manager and get complained at that he is too busy. Team meetings are held after work finishes (well the couple we have had this year are).
 So after a two week holiday, I just decided enough was enough. Fired out my CV and it took me 2 weeks to find a job.

 HPE have an official Q&amp;A that says you can put a Gen9 in Gen8, but can&#x27;t find anything newer.
 Thanks!

 Building manual, scheduled alerts on Splunk, I don&#x27;t feel very confident I&#x27;ve covered all possible attack scenarios.
 An NDR with its dynamic, real time alerts seems the perfect missing piece. (We already have EDR, email security, proxy etc)
 My only question is, does an NDR actually give you a peace of mind that it will block any possible malicious network activity?
 Has it been an added value for you?

 I have a 2-server PKI environment, with an offline root CA and one subordinate/issuing intermediate CA. I am trying to request a certificate from one of my template in the issuing CA, however I keep getting an error &quot; The certificate request could not be submitted to the certification authority&quot;. RPC server is unavailable.
 I&#x27;ve turned of firewall on the server and the CA server for tests, but requests still failing. 
 Any clues how I can resolve this?

 I found an online course for the a+ cert. Its 92 lectures and it would take a bit to sit through though it’s only 15 dollars. I don’t know if it’s worth the time or to try and get a interview now without any certs.

discovering fields/tasks that can be useful to the organization and brings more profit, convenience, efficiency etc
 that no one else is doing, knows about, has a plan to or knows how to
 introduce the tasks to management/executive and convince them to approve you to take on the tasks
 Once approved and deployed, develop and improve it to be critical to the organization mission -make the org to rely on it. It could be software, operational tasks, report generation etc
 voila you are no longer easy to fireable -not that you want to be the only one that knows it all because you can still share the skills with others/teach them.

                              <span>Background: I administer a simple Active Directory domain where all joined computers run Windows Server 2012r2, and the domain includes a database running SQL Server 2014.
 I changed a domain-wide GPO from a “never” account lockout threshold to “3 invalid login attempts” in Computer Config\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies. 
 A few hours after pushing the new account lockout policy, our developer discovered that a SQL Server Login (not a Windows/domain user) was unable to authenticate via SSMS or other methods (connection strings, etc). after multiple attempts with an incorrect password. Error Log for MSSQLSERVER said Event ID 18456: Login failed for ‘redacted’. Reason: “The account is currently locked out. The system administrator can unlock it.”
 The SQL Login lockouts stopped happening after I reverted the GPO to a “never” lockout threshold.
 QUESTION: Is it possible that the domain GPO account lockout policy is responsible for locking that SQL login?
 I assumed that the GPO only acted on domain users, but all the evidence suggests that’s either exactly what happened, or that’s one heck of a coincidence.
 Maybe if a policy is applied to Domain Computers, it also applies to the Database Server and therefore to SQL logins? Doesn’t sound right… but I’m at a loss!
 Happy to clarify or add any additional info I might’ve forgotten. 
 Any insight would be tremendously appreciated, as my boss insists I understand exactly why this happens, and I desperately want to. thank you!

                              <span>Hopefully I can post this here. My apologies if it isn&#x27;t accepted. 
 I am a System Engineer 3 currently. Our new director that took over a few months back has decided to move me to Cybersecurity Analyst position, since we do not have a security group. He wants me to build up the security group but I told him I believe going from an engineer to analyst would be a demotion. He said pay and everything stays the same but its not sitting right with me. Is it just me over thinking this is a demotion?

                              <span>Hello, fellow Redditors.
 We&#x27;re currently facing some challenges with our large-scale mixed deployment of Switches and Wireless Access Points from Cisco and Aruba, and I&#x27;m hoping to gather some valuable insights and suggestions from the community.
 Our network infrastructure consists of both Cisco and Aruba devices, and the main difficulties we&#x27;re encountering are as follows:
  
Different UI: Managing the network becomes a bit of a hassle due to the varying UIs. Aruba uses Airwave, while Cisco relies on DNAC. This disparity in UIs makes it time-consuming for us to navigate and configure both platforms efficiently. 
 Lack of Central Management and Monitoring: We&#x27;re struggling with the absence of a centralized solution for managing and monitoring devices across both platforms. It would be ideal to have a single management system that allows us to seamlessly control and monitor both Cisco and Aruba devices.
 Single NAC Solution: We&#x27;re in need of a Network Access Control (NAC) solution that is compatible with both Cisco and Aruba devices. This NAC solution should be fully functional and comply with standards such as RADIUS and TACACS+. Specifically, we&#x27;re looking for features like MAC profiling for dynamic MAC registration, BYOD portals, and guest portals. Additionally, it should support both wired and wireless 802.1x authentication and provide administrative authentication for Aruba and Cisco devices.
  
Open to any suggestions or recommendations that can help us address these challenges. If you have faced similar situations or successfully integrated Cisco and Aruba devices in a mixed deployment, your expertise would be greatly appreciated!
 Please share your experiences, or any solutions you might know of that could help us overcome these issues. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>For the second time in about 8 years of running a pair of LTM VEs under ESXi (vsphere cluster with Dell M640s, all dual-attached 10GE ports on VDS), I had one LTM VE &quot;lose&quot; its control plane but the data plane was still forwarding packets. The peer noticed the first one wasn&#x27;t sending heartbeats, so it tried to acquire the resources and tell the first one to release resources. The first one stayed online, and the result was both were stealing each other&#x27;s TCP sessions, causing random session resets, until I forcibly rebooted the first LTM VE node.
 This could have been prevented if the TMOS supported either sending a &#x27;power off the peer&#x27; command to VCSA, or if the ESXi/LTM-VE combination was capable of having a watchdog configured, where the hypervisor would reset the VM if it failed to receive any watchdog heartbeats after some period of time.
 Are either of these possible? We&#x27;re running TMOS 15.1.x, but can upgrade to 16.x if we need to.

                              <span>(Sorry if this is not relevant to this sub-reddit). I want to simulate a network with N number of nodes, could be Ubuntu or any VM that are connected (virtually of course) and have some open-source routing daemon running on them (I am thinking FRR ?) that supports BGP. I would then like the nodes to advertise their loopback IPs to the other nodes (could be all eBGP sessions) and then, say a head VM that can monitor these BGP sessions on all nodes every hour or so to make sure the sessions are all in Established state. I wouldnt want to use simulators like NS-3 or so and wanted to create the VMs and the connections between them on my own. Any suggestions if this is possible and where I should start looking from? Since I wouldn&#x27;t need GUI for controlling these VMs, I am thinking using something like kvm to launch multiple VMs on my laptop and then take it from there? Also for the open-source routing daemon, does FRR sound good? Thanks

                              <span>What do you think about firewalls like pfSense and OPESense, now that NGFWs extist? They are way cheaper, compared to Fortigate and Cisco; which makes them quite attractive for a small business that just needs a solid firewall with VPN support- and without a lot of money for networking equipment... With that being said, the firewall will be protecting pretty much all the company &quot;value&quot;, represented in a couple of source control servers.

                              <span>Given a setup like this: snipboard.io/TrJVaH.jpg
 In the first step, let&#x27;s assume two separate DSL lines going into two separate routers (VyOS machines). Both DSL lines provide public WAN IP via DHCP. VyOS boxes are configured to use NAT. On the inside VRRP is used for router redundancy.
 Now my concern is is NAT and its connection tracking. When a router handover occurs, all the connections will slowly have to time out (I believe). Is this the best that one can do?
 Now here is VRRP connection tracking sync. But I don&#x27;t see how this would help since both boxes have a different WAN address. So even if all connection tracking is synced, responses from the internet will fail on handover because responses are sent to the old WAN address.
 ​
 The only way how I see this working if the internet somehow sees the same WAN for both routers. How can this work?
 Question 1: Let&#x27;s assume we have no own IP network but only the two dynamically assigned WAN addresses by the two ISP. Is the sketched setup (without connection-tracking sync) the best that can be done?
 ​
 Question 2: Suppose we do have a /24 that is routed by the two ISPs. Now the public IPs are, say, 192.0.2.100 and 192.168.0.2.101 respectively. How would would one build a redundant router for an internal NAT network with that config? 
 The only way I can see this working is assigning the same public IP to the VyOS machine (some sort of &quot;multicast&quot;) but that&#x27;s of course not permissible. Or add another box in front of the two VyOS routers that performs NAT. But then there&#x27;s again a single point of failure and no point in having redundant routers behind it.

                              <span>Okay, so I was always the guy who told everybody that SA Lifetimes should match on both sides of IPSec tunnel.
 That was until last week when I was troubleshooting periodic downtimes on a tunnel that I just moved from ASA to our new Palo Alto. Remote side is a Virtual Private Gateway in our contractor&#x27;s AWS VPC.
 They were occuring at random times when rekeying Phase 2 SA.
 Sometimes the tunnel was up for two days and then suddenly dropped. Sometimes it dropped after just 3 hours. (Phase 1 - 8 Hours, Phase 2 - 1 Hour)
 The worst thing was that only Phase 2 SA went down and the AWS endpoint wasn&#x27;t able to deal with that so it always meant that nothing could pass through the tunnel until the IKE SA expired or until I cleared the SAs manually.
 Finally I got some time to troubleshoot and enabled debugs on PA. I also requested logs from the guy operating the AWS infrastructure (not a networking guy).
 After I had a look at these logs, I figured out that sometimes it would occur that we started rekeying the Phase 2 SA at the same time which eventually caused the new and the old SA to get deleted on PA.
 I ended up changing the P2 SA Lifetime so it&#x27;s longer than configured lifetime on the other side and I have no problems since because only one side initiates the rekey now...
 Never stop learning...

                              <span>Some background on me. I am currently a senior network engineer with a few years of experience and have CCNA, Sec+ and JNCIA certs. Also I am in the northern Virginia/ DC Area. 
 So my question is would it be more beneficial for me to spend the next couple years continuing to work my way up to the CCIE or do a masters degree ? The program I am looking at is a Masters of Telecommunications at George Mason University. My alternate plan is to just knock out a masters degree at WGU in 6 months and then quickly return to working on certs again. 
 Any input in appreciated. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We have been using EAP-TLS for years and we’ve tried to test WPA3 recently(CNSA/256). However, we found that the speed of Apple Devices(iOS/MacOS) is extremely slow, around 10 Mbps. The speed is normal in WPA3-128 and the CPU and RAM usage on AP is quite normal. Has anyone tested WPA3 on CNSA or 256? Thanks

 Hello All,
 The company that I work for has acquired a new MPLS Circuit from AT&amp;T at both our Primary and DR DCs that have been active for a few weeks now. Our Primary DC is hosted at a colocation and our DR is hosted in Azure and is connected via Netbond. Yesterday, we received a new MPLS Circuit also from AT&amp;T for one of our larger branch offices. This would now make a total of three CERs that are running on this new MPLS VPN from AT&amp;T (Primary DC CER, Azure ER, and Remote Office CER).
 Both DCs and Remote Office MPLS Circuits are l…</span>

                              <span>Hi so as the title says I&#x27;m looking for an android tablet with a stylus... as a network engineer, more and more if finding I have to make diagrams in Visio. The main problem is that I have is that i just get verbally told on what someone wants or if I&#x27;m trying to trouble shoot I like to normally draw the flow out on paper. So I&#x27;m looking to use it to make those initial diagrams I can sit with someone to get the &quot;cigarette packet&quot; drawing before making it look professional in Visio. Also I&#x27;ll be using it to take notes from meetings and learning new subjects etc... The only game I would play on it is something like RuneScape 3 (Yes I&#x27;m still a kid at heart :D)
 I was hoping the Pixel Tablet would be a good option but since I&#x27;m UK based I feel like the £599 price tag compared to the $499 US price tag is kinda a **** take... Also I dont want the stand thing.
 I am now Looking at the OnePlus Pad with the Stylo Pen which would come to £550.
 So Question is the OnePlus a good option or is there something else I should be looking at? (No Apple Please...)

 This is CAT6A F/UTP cable between the same two locations (patch panel  double outlet). A PoE switch is on one end and an AP is at the other end. 
 On the first link (333-1), the AP powers up but links at 10Mbps, on the second port it links up fine at 1Gbps.
 I know this probably means the pair 3/6,7/8 are busted, but why did it still PASS a fluke test?
 Is there any docs to learn how to interpret these results in general?

                              <span>I have 2 Servers (Domain Controllers) located on the different VLANs and Subnets but on the same site so they are basically behind the same firewall but seperated with VLANs.
 Host A pings Host B while Host B pings Host A.
 The result of Host A is Avg 0ms while the result of Host B is Avg 89ms tested with 20 pings.
 The Servers are virtualized in vsphere on 2 different hosts and the vsphere environment is connected to the bladecenter while the bladecenter is connected to vc switch which is connected to the 2 core switches. The Core switches are connected each to a firewall in active/passive mode where the VLAN of the 2 Servers terminates. The 2 physical ESX hosts are on different switch. Physical ESX Host A is connected to Core Switch 1 while physical ESX Host is connected to Core Switch 2. The Core Switches are connected with a Trunk Port of 2x 40 Gbit/s.
 The ping was executed in the same time on each host.
 Can someone explain what could be wrong here?

 I work at Faang company as an NDE , I have been in an ops team since one year and have absolutely not liked it since day 1 , I wanted to work more on larger scale design and architecture, my manager said that it would come as we go on so I rolled up my sleeves and delivered as much as I could , I got an exceeded expectations rating and very good reputation , but I don’t like doing 90% what I do , it’s been a year now so I had a discussion with my skip and he told me he could move me to the engineering team as soon as hiring freeze is over , but that could take a year or more I have no guarantee ,I don’t want to stay in ops anymore I have the opportunity to make a lateral move to another team in the org that is a mix of networking, cloud and automation but I am afraid ( I think it’s FOMO) that if I move I would blow my chance of ever being in the engineering team, what are you guys thoughts and advice on this ?

                              <span>Greetings, wizards of r/cisco! Buckle up, because we&#x27;re about to embark on an epic, slightly tongue-in-cheek journey through the wilderness of Cisco networking solutions. Brace yourselves, because it&#x27;s Traditional Cisco vs. Meraki.
 Round 1: Setup &amp; Ease of Use
 Traditional Cisco solutions are like those massive Lego sets with a gazillion pieces. They are fun (if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing), flexible, and the outcome can be magnificent. But you&#x27;ll need an entire weekend, a big table, and maybe a magnifying glass.
 On the other hand, Meraki is like your friendly IKEA furniture set. Open the box, follow the colorful, wordless instructions, and voila! You&#x27;ve got a bookcase... or was it a table? Either way, it was easy, right? That&#x27;s Meraki for you.

                              <span>Running a small operation here, with a couple of stacked Dell S4810&#x27;s as our core switches.
 To modernize things a bit, I got a quote for Arista 7280SR3-48YC8 for about $25K a pop. But it looks like I can easily get a refurb Dell S5148F-ON for a tiny fraction of the cost. I was frankly surprised that the used price has come down this low, when new units from these vendors still easily fetch in the high $10K&#x27;s and beyond, with huge lead times.
 Am I missing something here? It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m asking to compare Arista and Netgear… :)

                              <span>Next month, I and a couple colleagues will be on a media job out of town where lots of our work (editing) will be done in our own hotel room. Our network setup usually involves a subnet which gets its internet connection through hotel rooms&#x27; wired ethernet jacks. (The subnet is for a network drive). However, this hotel we are staying in particular has no wired ethernet ports in its rooms, only (good) Wi-Fi through a seemingly well-installed Ruckus AP system. Speeds are already solid and in the hundreds of megabits. No captive portals. I know all of this because I was there a few months ago.
 I&#x27;m looking to experiment and create my own sub-network that obtains its internet uplink wirelessly from the hotel&#x27;s Wi-Fi network. The machines don&#x27;t have Wi-Fi capability, so I&#x27;d rather try first to accomplish internet uplink on the subnet level. Of course this would involve a device that can connect to the hotel&#x27;s SSID and act as a wireless-to-wired bridge. The first device that comes to mind would be a wireless repeater, but to me that sounds cheap. Would that work? Does the Unifi line support this? Or is there other hardware that can do this?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I was reading through some articles about evil twin attacks today and was surprised that it seems like standard security protocols like wpa3 do not protect against these attacks. am i missing something? is it true that in 2023 there is no known defense against someone simply renaming their access point to the same name as someone else&#x27;s? i assume i am missing something because that seems almost comically easy to pull off.

                              <span>Had a lot of udld issues recently, some which only take one uplink down but others that take both links down. Results in needing to physical go around and console or reboot switches to get them back online.
 These issues occur during some distro switch upgrades or the other day when we had a switch have a bug. So no true lasting unidirectional links.
 Would like to have autorecovery of the errdisabled state but concerned about any potential impact of a udld event that lasts more than a few minutes and results in bringing a unidirectionally link online and it causing a problem before the udld timers shut it down.
 Using rpvst which usually converges in a few seconds but my understanding is that since both sides cannot detect bpdu that it would revert to basic stp timers of 30-50 seconds. Any downsides to bringing a unidrectional link back up with recovery? Would spanning tree timers prevent an actual issue?

I&#x27;m looking for old downloads of Cumulus Linux, or Switch Light Configuration examples (I assume I just have it mis-configured to not route traffic).
 Does anyone have a download location for the arm Cumulus Linux 2.x NOS or advice on getting Switch Light OS to route traffic between the ports? (Admin Interface/SSH works fine, just not the SFP+ ports)

                              <span>I need to design a flyaway rack that is going to highly remote locations to support up to 35 work stations (predominantly on wifi). I want to deploy 4 starlink dishes (we have the business dish) and combine them into one switch which has a number of APS on them.
 My main sticking point is what I use to load balance the 4 starlink networks. I have not got any experience doing this and need some advice on hardware solutions for this.
 Thanks
 Edit - I so far have:
 Starlink, Dream Machine Pro, 4 APS, Ups.
 All is configured and works well, I just need to add more network capacity and we have calculated that 3-4 Starlinks will do the trick.

 the 25G link between Core Stack C9500 and hypeflex node HX220C-M6S did not come up . The 25GBASE Cable 3 is totally working. I have checked the ports from Hyperflex and C9500 , everything is fine.
 I May have read somowhere that this issue is related to FEC config . Both ports need to be on cl74. I appreciate if you can help me.

                              <span>I set up 2 CRS305 switches a few years ago and I recall testing file transfers then and I was getting 800-900MBs with large VM files.
 Not sure if it was the cause but a few weeks ago I upgraded to the newest RouterOS firmware.
 While still in the RouterOS I also upgraded the RouterBOARD fireware to 6.49.7.
 I&#x27;ve tried switching to the switch SwOS and updated the SwOS version to 2.13 but it did not help.
 Not sure if it means anything but the main switch got stuck a few times when switching to the SwOS. Power cycle did not work. I had the same IP address in both configs but ended up using the reset button after the power was back. It did the same thing when trying to update the SwOS firmware. ???
 I have a simple setup with a few workstations and a laptop. They have very fast SSDs that can copy to each other in the same workstation at around 4-5GBs and to themselves at around 1-2GBs.
 I used the /int bridge port print command and all the ports have HW hardware on.
 __________________________________
 I&#x27;ve looked at it a bit more and with workstation1, workstation2 and the laptop all on the same CRS305 switch. Both WS1 and the Laptop get 1.00-1.02GBs and the Windows file copy graph looks flat with only very small dips. Looks really good. But if I copy from the WS1 to the Laptop or the Laptop to WS1 I get around 400-500MBs and it&#x27;s all over the place.
 WS1 and the Laptop are using Ethernet ports and Ethernet SFP modules on the CRS305 switch. WS2 has Fiber SFP modules. Not sure if that matters.
 ​
 Here is a video copying first on the laptop in the RDP window from WS2, then on WS1 from WS2.
 Then from WS1 to the Laptop and then from the laptop to WS1. The last one, laptop to WS1 is always the slowest to start, it goes up slowly.
 I just don&#x27;t get how/why copying from WS2 is rock solid on both but then between WS1 and the laptop is so bad.
 All three PCs have SSDs that can read and write over 3GBs.

                              <span>I’ve been in networking for almost a decade now. I still enjoy it but what gets me is how much specialized our work is. By that I mean you’re pretty much bound to the brands your company has. You’re going to be a Cisco guy or a checkpoint guy, etc. it’s just frustrating to keep up w these things, and worse if it gets replaced and you sort of start all over again and learn how this “new” tech is implemented differently 
 I guess my question is, what would be a worthwhile networking career path that’s the most vendor agnostic? I’m thinking python/automation but I’m not really up to date w what else is out there.

 Single being &#x27;wholesaler only&#x27; auth &amp; dual being &#x27;wholesaler &amp; retailer&#x27; auth. Could anyone explain to me how this works and what the benefits/disadvantages to each configuration are please?

 · IPv4 and IPv6 dynamic routes· OSPF v2, v3· PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, PIM-DM, PIM passive (IPv4, IPv6)· PBR· Virtual Route Redundancy Protocol VRRP (IPv4)· VRRP v3 (IPv6)· VRRP-E(IPv4/IPv6)· VRF (IPv4
 We will be using only one router/firewall, 15 switches distributed in 11 racks (a few stacked switches), 80 APs... Do we need OSPF? And as for PIM, we might be using multicast for the video surveillance system...
 No linked sites.... From another thread:
  
OSPF will make sense only if you have 2 links to and from the site. Even then I would recommend making it a totally stub site just to optimise the routing table.
  
Your thoughts?

 I have a switch (DCN S5750E-26X-SI). On one port I receive 10 vlans.
 Now, depending on MAC inside each of those vlans I need to put this MAC in vlan 3 or 4.
 From what I read, for MAC-based vlan input needs to be untagged.
 Is my only option to bridge those 10 vlans (I don&#x27;t need them separate, I just receive them like that form outside) then put this bridge on access an loop it to another port with MAC-based VLAN enabled?

                              <span>Hi,
 Looking for a direction to make a self organizing network that can handle dynamic multiple gateways.
 Imagine when a group of friends get together their phones would talk, confirm which has the best 5G service and all use that.
 or If no 5G, the next best available.
 and if one of them has run out of data for the month, can use any of their connection.
 (yes, ignoring security and all that. these would all be sharing on purpose and with full knowledge of the owners/users/etc/etc)
 I don&#x27;t imagine phones being able to do it, but is there a routing protocol that can handle dynamic gateway selection along with path selection?
 Thanks!

But enquring some people i know in this field told me to take some other courses related to cloud networking/computing since the field is moving more towards cloud based. The courses that they have suggested me are cyber security courses and cloud computing courses. As someone who just turned 25, i dont wish to spend another 3 years and land a job after 5 years. Really confused and scared of wasting time. What would be your suggestion? Is getting a CCIE certification would land a job? Is it future proof?

                              <span>Hey all, i&#x27;m volunteering to put together a POS system for a yearly neighborhood outdoor event and looking for advice on wifi there. The area I&#x27;m working with is about 200 feet and on the edge of it one of the businesses has volunteered their internet connection.
 Last year there were problems with connectivity, people are made of meat and water and the signal wouldn&#x27;t reach well during peak hours. Also there are just enough people that cell signals get jammed up, so it looks like a hotspot is out. We want to make sure that the square readers stay working. 
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking: I have a Linkstar I&#x27;ve been messing around with for shit and grins. Get a cheap point to point pair of antennas to go from the building with internet to a high spot above the beer garden and into to the linkstar. From there get a few fire tablets, reflash the firmware to get rid of the ads, and boom. 
 This is all on a budget, I&#x27;ll probably go out of pocket on it since it&#x27;s a non-profit thing. Is this the right way to go about this?

                              <span>What are your thoughts on what makes a good network document? How about a good diagram? What makes you look at a document and be like &quot;damn THAT&#x27;s a good document. I want my docs to look like that.&quot;
 Any standard outline you follow? How much detail do you put in versus assume that the reader should know the information?
 I&#x27;m in a very sad situation where I am forced to use power point as a technical knowledge dissemination tool, whereas a technical white paper would be more appropriate delivery mechanism. There&#x27;s just too much information to fit into the slides, and the people reviewing these slides are not all network engineers/architects. (I normally write with markdown and asciidoc and convert to PDF)
 I&#x27;ve brought this matter up with the management, but they insist on using power point. It&#x27;s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
 I&#x27;ve tried to scope the slides, by stating which slides are primarily intended for a more technical audience versus just a general one, however the problem is less-technical management loves to interject with their questions when they come across content they don&#x27;t understand.
 Others want to just take my slide deck, be able to look at some bullet points and get a basic idea, yet still be briefed on finer details of a design. It&#x27;s hard to find a balance.
 To me, power point is a visual aide for me to deliver a presentation, and a guide on where to get more detailed information. Not a zero to hero manual.

                              <span>Hey all, solo IT jack of all trades here. I&#x27;ve got a couple users who demand using a Macbook and therefore have to use Parallels if they want to be able to still access some of the applications used at our business. For some users, the only application they need from Windows is actually a RemoteApp from a third party company application that is only supported/installed on Windows. We do not own or manage this server. I don&#x27;t have admin access to the server and the remote company claims that there is no way for the RemoteApp to work on the Mac despite Microsoft having support for RemoteApps with their MacOS Remote Desktop App. In fact, I can even RDP into the server (but our accounts don&#x27;t have desktop access so they disconnect immediately), and if I setup a remote app with the info I have about their server I can see/list the RemoteApps but when I attempt to launch them I get Error code 0x104 (Unable to connect).
 ​
 I actually still have full access to an older server that we used to use RemoteApp with, so I might be able to learn something by looking at it.
 ​
 TLDR: Company claims their &#x27;custom&#x27; RemoteApp won&#x27;t work on the Mac even though it&#x27;s a glorified RDP connection. I say no but am not sure where to start. I have the RDP user credentials, server IP, and app name. I may be able to deduce the server filepath to the application as well.

 Background
 I help administer a hybrid environment with both on-prem AD and AAD. We also use GCDS to sync user profiles over to google for gmail and other google apps. Staff use MS SAML SSO for authentication with google.
 After the schooldude f* up we instructed users who had been affected to use a self-service password reset link that had been implemented years ago. This link goes to our internal ADFS server and resets their password in our local AD.
 Suspected Cause
 After the password reset some of these users have found their chromium profile broken. I say chromium because the issues persist in both Chrome and Edge despite all o…</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 I manaeg a network of abiout 50vms (primarily an RDS farm) on a Hyper-V cluster. The network is physically isolated from our workstation netowork. My access is via RDP to management VM with RSAT installed or console login via RMM tools. Where possible all tasks are performed from the RSAT either via GUI or Powershell remoting. 
 ​
 I am trying to get my head around the best way to manage accounts when its primarly just me (and one other to help when i am away). 
 I currently just login to any machine with my DA account and dont use the web for anything. I have a non da account that i use if i need to access the RDS farm as a user and peform non DA tasks (using the software we host in the farm) 
 ​
  
Should i be logging in to servers as a local admin user only? 
 Log into RSAT as a standard user and always use &quot;runas&quot; to lauch managment tools. 
 Should i have more than one &quot;Admin&quot; account? RDS admin, Hyper-V admin, FileServer admin etc? 
  
I get on teams to only give permnission to perform the tasks required etc. I find it harder to work out thge balance of security and practicality for a single SysAdmin

Something I have always struggled with was the process of rotating the password for the service accounts that we use in IIS. 
 You may ask, why don&#x27;t you just use app-passthrough? Some apps and vdirs use a UNC path to a share for their home directories and app passthrough won&#x27;t work for not only those, but for the parents of those vdirs and apps.

 Call comes in from a director of a client today saying her computer “was doing funny things”. Conversation progressed and we were told paragraphs disappeared from a word document and then emails started being deleted from her inbox. 
 Our initial response was to quarantine the machine, see if there was anything odd flagged in EDR or firewall and then proceed from there. Couldn’t find anything. 
 Turns out she dropped some of her lunch in her keyboard and the delete key got stuck down.
 Happy Friday!

 User was having a problem with their dock today, so I asked them on Teams, “please send me a picture of your dick”
 Didn’t hear back for a few hours, but noticed the user is still online. Went back and looked at the message I sent…
 I’m not sure what happens now, but I think I’m either getting into a relationship, or getting fired and sued. 
 Definitely Friday.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been running into this issue on just a few random users and on single machines. They insert their smart card and no certificates are pulled into the local store so nothing works. But if they go to ANY other computer and insert their smart card the certs show up and they are able to use it. 
 I&#x27;ve checked the Certificate Propagation service and its running correctly (to my knowledge). Kind of at a loss on how to continue troubleshooting this since there seems to be no errors associated with it that I&#x27;ve found. Has anyone ran into this problem?

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I wanted to start a discussion on the topic of whether customers need Web Application Firewalls to protect their Web (SaaS) applications. We are large educational institution
 I understand with SaaS model, the responsibility for securing the underlying infrastructure and platform lies with the service provider, while the customer is responsible for securing their own data and access.
 But sometimes customer needs to put additional security measures such as WAF to prevent from threats like DDoS attacks.
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and experiences regarding this topic What do you to protect Web SaaS apps.

                              <span>Was working as a Jr. SysAdmin for two years at a small insurance firm and just started a new gig as a SysAdmin L3 at a commercial bank in my state. I’ve almost been here a month and just starting to feel comfortable for the most part.
 I was brought on to replace the current L3 as he will be leaving for a government gig, was told he wouldn’t be leaving until the Fall so we can work together to transfer knowledge and responsibilities.
 We found out yesterday he is actually leaving for the new gig in a little less than 2 WEEKS. I got 5 projects that haven’t even really been started yet dropped on me and a bunch of meetings to follow them up. I was already still getting used to the environment and now this has just put me in a very anxious spot, feeling imposter syndrome hardcore now.
 Any advice from people in this position before?

                              <span>So Adobe Acrobat Pro license cost for business jumped from around $16.99 to $23.99 USD.
 That is a $8 USD bump.
 Which is an approximate 41% price increase.
 Of course trying to pay for an annual license yields no discount either.
 To justify the increase, they said this:
 *Why is the price increasing? Adobe Acrobat Pro has improved significantly over the last few years with the addition of many new features, including:
 Liquid mode, which automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens.
 Integrations with Google Suite, Box, and Microsoft that enable customers to collaborate and make changes to PDFs directly from Microsoft Teams.
 Expansion to new surfaces that allow customers to access our PDF tools on the web and mobile.
 New e-signature features that streamline workflows and eliminate the need for in-person and “wet” signatures that can slow business down.*
 Reason 1 and 3 should not have been used as a reason. That is like saying, we changed the template on our website to HTML5 and it should look okay now on your phone.
 So at what point does the price gouging stop? It seems like were being charged for common updates.
 The e-signatures, I can understand. Fighting DocuSign. DocuSign can lick my butt. But something tells me this will be removed in the future from the Pro license and used as an add-on service. Like the way Microsoft tells you, any person can call in to your Teams meeting. But you need a conference bridge, and only after you pay for the conference license of $2.50 per user. That pools your minutes together. Which can be chewed up by just a single user who mistakenly uses the call me at this number feature.

                              <span>Hi all,
 hoping someone might be able to offer some advice....
 we are looking at standardising our Windows 10 start menu, nothing major, just certain apps pinned to start under folders. This works fine.
 If we then follow M$&#x27; guide on adding the taskbar layout to the same xml file, it breaks the startmenu layout and ignores the taskbar changes.
 if we take the taskbar section out, all works again as it should.
 using GPO, we copy the layoutmodification.xml to the default user profile, and also to a local folder (c:\scripts), without the taskbar settings it works fine, but with them in it all stops working, so new users get a startmenu with no items pinned and the default taskbar.
 ​
 ​
 the XML file with the taskbar settings, looks like this

                              <span>I just started as the local IT support for a medium-sized manufacturer. Their environment has no structure that I can see, or at least it&#x27;s very limited (a few VLANS and a domain). I&#x27;m new to running the show, and I would greatly appreciate any advice on where to begin to try to get this place in order.
 Most of the machines are on Windows 11 right now, with some of the servers on 2012 and some I&#x27;m not even sure of. We have a handful of legacy applications which require some *really* old software to run, and I&#x27;m hoping to sandbox all of that in a VM eventually.
 We have multiple different backup solutions, some of them local and some of them are cloud-based. All of that is automated already.
 I&#x27;m working on a hardware inventory, as what we had was woefully inadequate and so I&#x27;m not actually 100% certain of what&#x27;s present beyond what I can walk around and see.
 Our server room is unsecured; Anyone can just walk right in with no fob and no swipe.
 We do have a corporate help desk from the company that purchased this location, but they primarily just manage purchasing decisions and provisioning.
 So, again, in terms of where to begin, right now I have my eyes firmly on the security of our server room and the hardware inventory, followed by getting hosts on some kind of naming convention and then the same for users... I&#x27;m sure there are a hundred more important things I could and should be thinking about, so please do feel free to shout at me what you think those are.

                              <span>I made a simple suggestion to a professor regarding the lack of modules that cover servers / potentially systems administration, and to my surprise it was turned into an actual third year undergraduate module at my university.
 This module will be taught over a ten week period with a one-hour lecture per week, switching to a more practical format later in the term. The professor is quite familiar with Linux and distributed computing, but is currently still outlining the module and taking suggestions;
 This is a final year module in a bachelors degree in computer science, and students should be somewhat familiar with Linux by this point. What type of content would you recommend in a module like this?

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

But the first tools didn’t work, can’t read them out. I have no experience with sas and the paths I’ve to go. Just wanna check them to be okay and sell them. Can you guys help me out and tell me what tool I can use at a win7 64Bit? Thank you a lot!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at the new Outlook. While it has some improvements, it is missing many features that have existed for years. It reminds me of the Windows 11 Start Menu - pretty and new, but far less functional than the old version.
 My list does not consider GUI changes (because they are subjective) and ignores bugs/crashes/slowness of the new Outlook.
 Here&#x27;s what I found so far...
 New features:
  
Pin/Unpin Email
 Snooze email
 Density has 3 choices instead of 2
 Can preview message text next to subject in message list
 Board
 Integrates MS Loop cloud components
  
Features removed (in no particular order):
  
Customize ribbon
 Ribbon cannot be hidden
 Choose columns to show in message list
 Separation of categories from subject in message list
 Shared categories cannot have color

                              <span>Hello,
 In advance I would like to thank anyone who has any thoughts on this.
 I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out unable to fix it. But I&#x27;m no Azure admin, when it comes to troubleshooting. Just a guy doing his best.
 We have 6 users onboarded onto a file share in Azure files. They access it from onsite/wherever they are. The storage account itself is &quot;StorageV2 (general purpose v2)&quot; &quot;Hot Tier&quot;.
 The files stored in here are company Excel files. Some of these files are able to get into excess of 50-100MB. With lots of links, formulas, etc.
 The issue that is occurring seems primarily occur when accessing files larger then 1 or 2 MB.
 The issue being that when a larger excel file is accessed the windows file explorer (explorer.exe) will hang. Sometimes it will return to function within seconds, but it generally needs to be closed via task manager. 
 It is replicable on multiple computers, so I do not think it is a local issue, and occurs both offsite on home internet, on onsite on our guaranteed 1000/1000 link, I had begun to think it was an IOPS issue but I can&#x27;t find any reports on throttling in the azure monitoring.
 I am at a bit of a loss of where to go to from here, view the process and what it is waiting on in task manager when it is hanging gives me &quot;one or more thread of explorer.exe are waiting to finish network I/O&quot; as if explorer.exe has stopped communicating to the internet, but the file will finish downloading and launch. still.
 I am just absolutely confounded. If anyone has any ideas or could point in the right direction of some information to check out, I would be eternally grateful.

                              <span>Does anybody know labor laws in California that well when it comes to On-Call Policies?
 Recently, my company shifted to a new company, and everything has been so hectic. We&#x27;re about 3 months into the new company, and we still don&#x27;t have a defined on-call policy. My management has been making up rules on the fly as we go, and it&#x27;s really starting to get to us. We went from being restricted, to no restrictions and a loose &quot;1-2 hour response time&quot;. Instead of standby, they were doing block hours, where ticket &#x3D; 2 hour pay, but as of today they&#x27;ve taken that away. We&#x27;ve been told that our overtime for on-call is basically just &quot;whatever we worked&quot;. Except, we&#x27;ve been told that we still need to look at tickets (we get texts for urgent tickets), but we need to decide if we&#x27;ll respond or not. If…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m running into an issue where all users are unable to access the MS Store and private store. When attempting to launch the store they receive an error message stating that it has been blocked, and to check with your IT or system administrator. Code: 0x800704EC
 It&#x27;s definitely GPO related as the event viewer&gt;store&gt; operational, states that it has been blocked by policy (Event ID 4), show error page. 
 All settings in the GPO relating to the store seem correct, but i did find the following in gpresults reporting... @(Microsoft.WindowsStore11606.1001.39.0_x64_8wekyb3d8bbwe?ms-resource://Microsoft.WindowsStore/Resources/StoreTitle) This rule might contain some elements that can not be interpreted by the current version of GPMC reporting module.
 Anyone run into this recently, or have any ideas?

                              <span>For anybody that works with containers, has Red Hat discontinued all the old &quot;standard&quot; (registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel for example) RHEL container images in favor of the ubi images? I&#x27;ve only been able to find an ubi while searching the registry.access.redhat.com registry. And if so has anybody had any level of success using the ubi images to sync the full RHEL 8 and 9 repositories?
 edit: The &quot;registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel&quot; image is still available, I meant the equivalent image for RHEL 8/9.

                              <span>I got laid off today due to restructuring in the company. 
 I told my staffing agency. They felt sympathetic and will do what they can to find me another job.
 I’ve been getting interviews, with startups, mid size corporations and even Amazon. Some of these manage to go past the initial phone screen and to the hiring manager. I even had one where I talked to an executive. 
 What am I doing wrong? Is it due to the market? I admit that I know Azure, AD, Office 365 and have used Windows server but don’t have advanced knowledge, especially of server backups. I have 2 years of work experience, a Business IT Management degree and am studying for Network plus (which I have failed many times before sadly)
 How can I conduct myself in interviews better? I do dress up in an office shirt with a tie.
 I am in NYC, which is very competitive, like many other cities.
 How quickly do people get rehired after layoffs? Will a staffing agency help you find another position?

I am a part of a small infra team managing around 1200 onprem servers and we are currently using Solarwinds, however, I feel like there must be many better thought solution… We need to monitor: Esxi hosts VMs (windows, linux) Physical servers Network traffic Etc.
 Edit: forgot to mention that I have worked with zabbix and I absolutely love it! However, management is against open source solutions so when I pushed for it, it got shot down faster than a Russian helicopter flying over Ukraine…

 &quot;The feature doesn&#x27;t exist in New Outlook.&quot;

                              <span>I just started as IT Manager at a new company. I spent the first month trying to get a lay of the land because I dropped in almost blind. The previous manager left before I started, so I had to feel my way through the company structure without a guide, or documentation. 
 Today, while the exec director (my supervisor) is out on vacation, she called me into her office and asked me to set her up to access the documents on his desktop. Why not. Idgaf. 
 So I opened explorer and \CompName\c$ and boom she was in. No pw authentication prompt. I checked AD and she&#x27;s a freaking domain admin. 
 I was warned she had control issues, but that&#x27;s just bonkers. To put the entire company&#x27;s security at risk just for power that you don&#x27;t know how to wield is a sign of some deep issues. Any anxiety I had is out the window. It&#x27;s like seeing someone naked.

                              <span>Just as title says. We were just notified that the company is removing the cellphone reimbursement for everyone across the board, and the expectation is that we will still use our cell phones at personal expense. Any suggestions how I deal with this? We are in California and the law seems clear on this. I&#x27;ve reached out to a law firm to discuss.

                              <span>Covered previously here. 
 In 2020 the VP of Engineering left and tried to elevate me to the lead Tech Lead on top of the other Tech Leads sitting on top of Engineering. Since he was leaving, though, as well as the IT Director, I feared they would put me in charge of all of IT if I accepted, so I suggested a peer structure for the tech leads, which is what we went with.
 Fast forward a year and the interim IT Director leaves and they don’t replace him. Fast forward another year and they ask me to be the Director of IT as discussed in that previous post. I assessed what was needed, recommended they hire a director of IT with experience in IT management and tried to move on.
 A couple of months later they asked me to take over some temporary IT responsibilities while the main IT person was on vacation. A few months later they ask me to manage him. 🤦‍♂️ I again reiterated that they should hire an IT Director and that I would prefer to stay in software development, managing engineers.
 A couple of months later they laid me off as some in the previous thread predicted.
 I suppose the lesson in there could be to just do whatever job they ask you to do and suck it up, but the lesson to me is that I had it sniffed out for 3 years earlier where this was all headed. They wanted a Director of IT on the cheap and without listening to the recommendations of their own staff.
 It&#x27;s still burning me up when I think about it. I was functionally doing the job before being laid off. I just didn&#x27;t agree to it being permanent.

I have done telco jobs and rack and stack field tech jobs, data Center jobs and coax cable set top box jobs, I have done sydadmin jobs and MSP jobs. BUT none of these jobs actually pay “well”. Can anyone give advise as to what I should do next as high inflation is killing me and I have reach a point where I am questioning my life path.

                              <span>So I love my wireless headphones… to the point I routinely sing the entire time I’m down here… I forgot recently that our data center has video surveillance and didn’t realize we have audio as well…
 Anyone ever wonder if they sound as bad as they think they do when singing at the top of their lungs in a room of white noise hoping to never be heard… yet forget in our day in age we have audio/video recordings potentially anywhere?
 I just hope the team gets a laugh and an enjoyable serenade 😂 at least I’m working on my karaoke 🎤 🎶 skills 😆 😝

                              <span>Due to life and reasons, at 59, I&#x27;m trying to find an IT job after a long time away.
 Twenty years ago I worked in IT; my last job was VB programming and AS/400 MS-SQL integration. Since then I&#x27;ve been a stay-at-home dad, with a homelab. I&#x27;ve also developed some electronics skills and been interested in microcontrollers, etc. I&#x27;ve been into Linux since the 90s. I know I have the skills necessary to be a competent asset to an IT department.
 I&#x27;ve been applying online, and about half the time I&#x27;m told my application&#x27;s been viewed more than once, but I&#x27;ve yet to receive any responses beyond that. I&#x27;m usually only applying to system or network admin jobs, seeing as the engineering jobs usually want college; I have no degree.
 Should I be trying to find a really small, 1-2, person IT department and give up on the bigger corporate places? I live in metro Detroit. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Just wondering if y&#x27;all have ever experienced this or have any courses of action to take. 
 My Org has a Microsoft Surface that we keep off of our domain - it goes to trade shows and contains no protected information. However, we pulled it out this year and the password to get into it did not work. Our sales team has locked themselves out of it entirely. There is nothing of major importance on there, but they do want to get into it to pull the stuff that is. 
 It is locked out, and I don&#x27;t have the option to switch the user to login to the local admin. It is not on our domain, so I can&#x27;t go through that. I may be explaining this poorly. 
 Is it hopeless to try to get back into it?

                              <span>It&#x27;s deeply saddening to see all of our favorite products being shifted to a subscription or pay-as-you-go model. Vendors getting greedy with licensing. Nickel and diming customers to death. 
 - Microsoft Office
 - Anti-Virus
 - Servers (cloud, etc)
 - Networking (Meraki and others)
 - Veeam (licensed per-vm now instead of socket-based)
 ​
 are there any vendors left that allow you to buy perpetual licensing? I understand the reasoning for them - continued stream of ongoing revenue. I miss the days where you could buy a product and use it until EOL without yearly subscription fees, aside from maybe warranty/support.
 ​
 What is the future for IT? Subscription workstation hardware? I guess that&#x27;s technically VDI. Good grief.

 Anyone have experience with this recently that could recommend a budget android tablet that could be placed in a mount? Trying to keep cost down.

Something we have access to is the kspice kernels in Oracle Linux (rebranded RedHat). In theory this takes away much of the pain of a patch cycle but how hard is this implementation? What’s the downside?

 ​
 My organization recently ordered two Dell PowerEdge servers, each with dual CPUs (8c/16t per CPU), and set up a vSphere environment with vCenter. I have made a template for Windows Server 2022 Datacenter and had questions regarding the WS licenses we received. The licenses are &quot;Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (16 CORE)&quot; and we received two product keys per each of the servers. Is there anything I should know if I were to assign these product keys to VMs? I read that the WS22 DC licenses are unlimited use per host compared to the Standard edition. If they are unlimited use, can I use the same product key on each of the servers running VMs? We are attempting to do failover on the servers as well, which is currently set up; we just need VMs now. Also, am I able to add the product key to the template I made and every future VM from that template will be licensed as well?
 ​
 Any insight is appreciated.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been trying to stand up a new domain controller. Cloned a VM of an existing one and started updating it. However I&#x27;ve hit a massive roadblock. Since this is for a different geographic location I figured we should update our list of time servers to include something for the west site so when the east site becomes a smouldering crater everything can still keep running. Redundancy and all that. 
 Our existing domain controllers have 4 time servers already, but they&#x27;re all in the east. So I hop into a Powershell session on the new DC and hammer out the following:
 w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:&quot;server1.domain.com,0x8 server2.domain.com,0x8 server3.domain.com,0x8 server4.domain.com,0x8 server5.domain.com,0x8&quot; /syncfromflags:manual /update 
 I get the message that the command ran successfully. All good right? I go to verify with:
 w32tm /query /peers 
 Bad news. Nothing has changed. It&#x27;s still the same four time servers that were originally there. 
 I&#x27;ve spent the better part of a week researching and attempting all permutations of the command I can think of to induce literally any change to the list and nothing. I&#x27;m throwing in the towel on this one. I need help.

                              <span>We have been experiencing some brute force login attacks against some of our sites over the past 12 hours or so. Upon further digging all of the IPs are in Sprint ranges. Upon digging further with NMap they all have 3128/tcp open squid-http. I then did a more detailed scan and came back with:
 3128/tcp open squid-http? | fingerprint-strings: | GetRequest, HTTPOptions: | HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently | Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 12:46:31 GMT | Content-Type: text/html;charset&#x3D;utf-8 | Content-Length: 0 | Location: https://www.tplinkcloud.com/
 Which made me think of recent articles:
 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-infect-tp-link-router-firmware-to-attack-eu-entities/ https://duo.com/decipher/mirai-botnet-attackers-exploit-tp-link-bug
 We are going to report this to sprint as well but is it possible we uncovered a much bigger thing here? Are sprint customer routers being compromised and no one is aware?

                              <span>In summary, we have a large organization with more than 400 clinics connected through a s2s VPN. My current project involves identifying all the X-ray machines in our clinics along with their respective models. We have a variety of brands such as ICAT, Planmeca, Vatech, Sirona, Dexis, and more. The success of this project is crucial as any inaccuracies could jeopardize my job. I aim to automate the process, but due to the diverse range of X-ray machine brands in our environment, finding a universal solution is challenging. The operating systems of the devices lack consistency and sufficient detail for a simple network scan. Additionally, not all models provide this information in the registry. The best approach I can think of is to rely on human input, albeit with the potential for human error. I plan to email each clinic manager, requesting the model and serial number of the X-ray machine, or even a picture of it, to ensure comprehensive accuracy.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have been asked to get &quot;encryption&quot; set up on emails for users that are sending sensitive information externally and internally. 
 What I have done so far is create a rule inside of exchange that states if the subject has &quot;Encrypt&quot; in it, then apply m365 Message encryption and rights protect message with &quot;Encrypt&quot;. This works great when sending to an external email, it forces the recipient to authenticate to view, and allows them to download and view an excel or docx file attached. 
 The issues is internally, if I send a encrypted email to anyone within my domain, they can view the message but not the attachment, it tells them to request permission and that does nothing? I have tried to go into properties of the file and add the domain user but am unable to. I keep reading about IRM settings, but have so far been unable to locate where I can edit those. 
 If there is a better way to go about this whole process, please let me know. 
 Thank you for any guidance you can provide.

                              <span>Recently I started replacing monitors for some users and have had pushback from managers on why I am replacing something that works. They have no issue when we install a new computer, laptop, or keyboard/mouse and those have a shorter replacement schedule. But monitors have been getting pushback. Screens do fade over time, and the newer hardware is generally lighter, thinner, and better connected options. 
 Our schedule is Desktops/Laptops - 4 years, Monitors - 6 years, Network - 6 years, Copiers/Printers - 6 years. All of this is subject to change based on needs or growth, but this is the guide we follow. We have some gear that is a lot older and not been replaced such as monitors that are 8 years old and some printers that are the same age. 
 Curious if I am way off on this or what others have as a replacement schedule?

                              <span>I have a client that uses SharePoint Online as their file server and they map their library as a network drive by first enabling IE mode for the SharePoint site since IE no longer exists, then adding the library as a trusted website in Edge, then going to Map Network Drive and using the folder address to the library to map it as a drive letter. 
 What benefit does this have over simply adding the SharePoint folder as a shortcut to their OneDrive?
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I would like to ask for maybe stupid question, but I didn&#x27;t find any answer yet.
 I&#x27;m new as a sysadmin and we&#x27;re currently changing our ISP. My coworker told me that we need a pool of 4 public IP address for each office we&#x27;ve.
 I asked the reason and he told that we&#x27;ve to split it for security like:
 - Public IP Address for VPN
 - Public IP Address for posting content(webpages, ftp, etc.)
 - Public IP Address for Internet surfing
 Well. As I said, I tried to search for that but I din&#x27;t found any answer. So do you think guys this is a tipically practice in business ? Or it&#x27;s a foolishness ? 
 If that&#x27;s true, how can I get info about that for document myself ?
 Thanks !

 We just found around 30% of our computers does not get language pack install.
 Any idea what would be explaining language pack missing? There are no language pack install on fault computers.
 The issue seems to be random.

 obviously the network is already segmented, one aspect we are considering is client protection and isolation, I was thinking it would be nice to prevent potential lateral movements between clients, so blocking everything between clients and allowing only traffic to/from allowed servers, they even have a nomachine based browser solution for employee to go on the web on personal/non work sites, so I can really come up with a specific list of allowed traffic.
 I&#x27;m a linux guy by trade, so I don&#x27;t know much about windows/AD, has anyone done this?
 when I looked at the default windows firewall rules there&#x27;s a bunch of useless stuff there (at least in this context), I was planning to nuke the default profile and make one from scratch, what should I do for AD? is this it?

 any unforeseen consequences I should be aware of? any pointers you guys have?

                              <span>Hey all. I’m stumped and hoping you can help. 
 Our client suddenly stopped receiving mail yesterday around noon. 
 I checked Admin.Microsoft&gt;domains and found this message &quot;The name server (NS) or Start of Authority (SOA) records for your domain aren&#x27;t set up correctly. Check the NS records and the primary name server specified in the SOA record to make sure they are valid, internet-facing, name servers hosting your domain&#x27;s records.&quot;
 I also ran MX and NS lookups on whatsmydns.net. Both returned with near zero propagation. (NS is showing resolution in Mexico City, Russia, and Pakistan but nowhere else)
 DNS records are entered correctly in our registrar (domain.com) and have not been recently changed. I chatted with their support and they kept saying “wait 24 hours” and “everything looks good on our end”.
 At this point we’re ready to just switch registrars to stop the bleeding, but I would love any other ideas if y’all have them. 
 TIA

                              <span>Operation wise or update wise - in general I think everything works quite well. 
 I don&#x27;t have issues like 10 or 15 years ago where quickest solution was to reinstall system and any software that was there or restore image. 
 Hardware seems also much more reliable. Even printers... 
 Well should not be surprise because a lot of people are working to do so. 
 Wondering if it is just me being lucky with environment I work in, me being just much more experienced to properly setup stuff or don&#x27;t touch things I should not, but maybe it is just N&#x3D;1 and everyone else has different opinion?

                              <span>UK based, currently have ~3 years exp as a solo sys admin for an entirely cloud based (azure + m365) fintech adjacent startup. I quit last November for a &#x27;sabbatical&#x27;. My plan was to get the az-104 cert, both as extra evidence I know what I&#x27;m doing and so I can fill in knowledge gaps, plus it gave some justification for the sabbatical in interviews.
 Unfortunately I need a new job sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve been studying, but after taking a practice exam... It isn&#x27;t looking great. Based on my last job I&#x27;m confident in my abilities in practice, but the practice exam seemed very based on memorising minutiae instead. While the exam wasn&#x27;t great, tons of grammar and spelling errors making it hard to parse, I do believe the types of questions are representative.
 I can continue to study but I&#x27;ll end up going over budget, or I can pause this, start interviewing now without the cert, and hope for the best.
 Do you think there will be a significant difference between my offers with 3 years azure etc experience + 6 months break vs the same but with az-104 picked up in that time? Would mentioning my cert goal and studying help? I have very little interview experience :(
 Tldr: difference in ability to land a good job with or without az-104 after 3 years cloud sysadmin exp, and a break?

                              <span>I have a friend that&#x27;s making a fairly radical career change and will be starting as an entry level IT support/sysadmin with a smallish company (very modest footprint - Windows laptops, half a dozen servers, SIP phone system, a bunch of printers and some very conventional networking). 
 He will be supported by me (~25 years in IT, experienced Windows/Linux/etc engineer), but my background is pretty much all self-taught/on the job. His new employers are happy to put him through a moderate amount of training to get him up to speed and support his growth, but I have no idea what certifications currently offer the most value at this level. MCSE? Comptia? 
 Any suggestions people can offer (and any supporting info they can provide) would be very welcome.
 Thanks...

                              <span>In the days where everyone was in the office we used an on-prem web proxy from Sophos which gave us really good reporting on websites visited and ability to block categories etc. We have moved away from Sophos for our AV now and with hybrid working it wouldn&#x27;t have worked anyway so I&#x27;m interested in what people use to monitor, report on and block web sites. For a bit of background our endpoints are intune managed but most of our apps come from citrix servers which are on prem. We have a sonicwall firewall but its not doing any https inspection and would only cover people in the office anyway.

 Can i get something like a weekly report from Windows server to my email, on a dashboard or pdf document etc which shows information such as
 -how many new accounts were created in a time period and details of the accounts
 -summary of user account lock outs, password resets etc
 -summary of user account that were disabled, deleted etc
 -summary of server restarts, shutdowns etc
 -Summary of DC logins with IP addresses, user etc
 -summary of remaining free DHCP IP addresses
 -etc
 More like something that will give some information on the health of the server, activity or i can quickly glance to see anomarlies which can later be drilled into

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I&#x27;am a sole Sysadmin in our company with about 250+ users based in Europe. I started around about 1 Year ago there and cleaned up a lot from IT Assets, Processes and Policies short I got some structure in IT there before I was there there were almost nothing just chaos. We are a fully SaaS Company and in general I manage all SaaS tools (Google Workspace, Slack, WorkspaceONE and couple more tools we dont have an Provider like OneLogin but at the end I try to Automate everything to make it a bit easier for me) for our Hardware we are currently 50/50 one half is managed by us the other is managed by our Hardware provider but ofc. I also manage them. Little sub note: all devices that comes from our Hardware Provider are MDM managed all others are getting added by myself step by step you know its pain sometimes to get first all the Users Device Informations (Have to ask them). Since couple months it can get really busy almost max. of my cap thats why I wrote some more policies and telling the users to always using the IT Helpdesk if they have any Questions. Now I had a meeting were they ask me to write down my tasks I did last week and asked my about IT Outsourcing to Support me e.g as Backup when being Sick or on Vacation. I told them yes we can check out but I am not sure if this would be the solution In my opinion we should get another sysadmin there) I &#x27;am also a bit scared about if maybe I get replaced after they Implement the IT Outsourcing since I worked a lot in the company and did a lot changes I would be really sad If something like that would happens.
 ​
 Somehow I feel since the Meeting not quite well, I always think about it. Do you have any tips? atm. I&#x27;am on vacation for 4 Days without any Backup.
 ​
 Best regards,

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m setting up new WiFi network for the office using Meraki APs and want to use AD authentication. I&#x27;ve set up the NPS server (WS2019) as explained in the documentation, but I have problems with windows 10 clients. 
 I think the configuration is correct since I tried with with other devices and are connecting without problems. With W11 I can connect using computer and user account, and with iOS and Android with ad user with no problems.
 I already re-checked NPS policies, check that 802.11r is disabled on APs. W10 clients are on 22H2 so sholud be ok, right? And as I said basically all the other devices are working... 
 In the logs the only I see is error 16 - Authentication failed due to user credentials mismatch, but credentials are right.
 Did anyone face this situation? Thanks.

I&#x27;m just wondering if there is any way for me to find any machines that I&#x27;ve missed that are still authenticating through it. Google seems to just give information about the current machine you are on, and which DC that machine auth&#x27;d through.
 ​
 Any advice appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 I hope I explain well. english is not main language and that&#x27;s also what makes my internet searches more difficult.
 I am at my wits end here with a legacy software that we want to use through RDP on some older Datalogic Skorpio (x3 and x4) 
 The problem is when creating new users:
 the user is added to several groups, most importantly group that autoexec c:\myapp\launcher.exe
 (through the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot;)
 our launcher then allows to start other apps they need, one of them doesn&#x27;t work right away tho
 it&#x27;s an old 3rd party (obsolete, but will require a couple years to phase out) that requires some cache temporary folders in c:\users\user\appdata
 this folder doesn&#x27;t exist when creating a new user and with the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot; apparently is not created properly
 THE WORKAROUND: the workaround is to remove the user from the &quot;autoexec&quot; for aa few minutes, log in manually to that user so windows creates those folders upon first login, then add the user back to the &quot;autoexec&quot; GPO and now everything works
 ​
 so, when logging in manual once, %appdata% cache folders are created properly (with proper persmissions) but when the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot; is enabled from the very beginning, it doesn&#x27;t work
 we don&#x27;t have remote folders or any of that.
 is there a way to solve this so we don&#x27;t have to log into the user manually without autoexec every time we make a new user?

                              <span>Hello,
 We are experiencing issues with a bunch of machines reverting their Version of Win10. It could be something else but as far as we found out, if one of our AD-Admins logs in to a computer where a normal User was logged in, the Win10 Version get&#x27;s downgraded to Win10 Pro from Enterprise. Not a big deal at the moment but in our reports we&#x27;re having like 100 Pro Versions now where there should be a solid 6k Enterprise. Funny thing is, when the User logs back in to his PC it takes ages to get it back to Enterprise by himself or the Azure Sync.
 Our Users have an MS E3 license. Admins don&#x27;t have a license as of now. 
 We already had a MS Ticket open and they provided us with the solution to just run a PS-script but we are still searching for the root cause to eliminate that. 
 If we run slmgr /dlv we can see in the script host window that it&#x27;s Win10 Pro and licensed but on the Win10 settings pane it says Win10 Enterprise, which is also strange.
 Anyone else having such issues? Or similar things? Have to be honest that the AD-Admin Accounts are just our first guess.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi there
 maybe you can assist me :)
 i have 1 Remote Desktop Server (Win 2022) and 10 Users. There is only 1 Workstation.
 the single Workstation will be used hourly bi other people. so my plan/wish is:
 ​
  
User 1 goes to workstation, put in his smart card (as example an yubikey)
 Remote Desktop will automatically start and require the PIN from the User 1
 Session Start....
 If the User unplug the SmartCard, RDP Session close (user still logged in)
 User 2 goes to workstation...
 ...
  
i was able to set up this scenario for the most part with yubico:
 https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013707820-YubiKey-Smart-Card-Deployment-Guide
 but this is not 100% user (and admin) friendly, i&#x27;m not able to autostart rdp on plugin yubikey, sometimes i have to change from user/pw to smartcard manually. on unplug yubikey an error message (from mstsc.exe) appears...
 is there an company / tool who can handle this scenario? do you know an &quot;all in one&quot; solution for this? i believe there must be many company&#x27;s (hospitals, retirement home&#x27;s etc.) which work similarly to this...
 thanks a lot :)
 edit:
 - all on prem, azure ad is available...

 They are finding that a very small percentage of URLs look legit but redirect to NSFW sites. The datasets are large so the URLs can&#x27;t all be manually checked. Is there a service that can access a potentially large list of URLs, check where they are redirected to, and flag if the site redirected to is NSFW or hosts malware?
 Thanks!

 Must have the ability to connect without the user approving - so we can make changes while they are at lunch
 What&#x27;s best of breed nowadays?

 Anyone have a good solution for a temp label so I can pull 96 cables and plug them back in on a new switch?
 Like port 1, port 2, etc...just something quick and temporary

                              <span>Hi all, I am looking to set up a SOHO network supporting 10GoE, which will have around 6 workstations, two NASs with dual bonded nics, printers, a WAP, and a few other network connected devices. There are times of heavy data transfers of 1TB or more and regular transfers of ~50GB+.
 I’m thinking a minimum 24-port switch, which will allow for future expansion. I’m looking for suggestions on a switch, that will probably need to be managed for possible future VLAN setup. Please let me know what you’d implement and what you’d avoid. While I will likely have the support of the IT department, this will likely be managed locally by me, with some networking (and learning more rapidly) knowledge. Thanks in advance!

Thinking of moving them to Aruba switches and wondering if I can mix in the Arubas with the existing Netgear as I make the transition. What might be the most significant issues that would likely present themselves in such an environment? Or will these switches play nicely together while I swap them out over the coming months?

 I&#x27;m trying to ping hosts on directly connected network but can&#x27;t see reply. I can see correct arp entry on the ASA. ICMP inspection is enabled in global policy. Access lists is any any on both inside outside interface. Strange. 
 Any idea what&#x27;s going on?

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently took over a new network and we have been asked to reduce cost across the board including our SDWAN. Currently we use an MSP with Velocloud devices. We pay ~$1000/month on average per branch for the Velocloud managed-service. Most of our branches are very small ~5 users, leveraging Velocloud Edge510. We have ~20 sites.
 I have a couple of questions:
  
Can Velocloud devices be customer-managed? (wondering if we can save by removing managed services)
 Does anyone have good experience with any other lower cost &quot;branch router&quot; options that have simplified/central management? It doesn&#x27;t have to be SDWAN necessarily but if it is SDWAN, we are looking for an SDWAN that can be customer-managed so that the cost is lower.
  
Thanks.
 Edit:
  
Just found the $1000/month average was skewed by mid/large sites. My apologies for the confusion!
 The correct average cost for small sites with Velocloud Edge510 (with 30Mbps throughput) is around ~$200/month per site, this includes hardware device(s), license and managed-service (it&#x27;s a bit lower for sites with a single VCE router and higher for sites with dual VCE routers).
 Based on the comments this appears to be a more reasonable cost for the small sites though it&#x27;s still good to see what others are using or recommending for lower cost alternatives. Appreciate it!
  
Thanks again!

                              <span>Ok I have taken a picture and uploaded it here for my question:
 https://ibb.co/P1dK5Zp
 On the remote logging target page of the ISE server, WHY oh WHY is the only option you can choose for the SSL certificate the ISE will present to the remote syslog server, a &quot;CA&quot; certificate. The ISE is not used as a CA, it&#x27;s a client/endpoint with its own system certificate, only. It is just a node with its own publically signed SSL cert. Yet, you can litreally only choose a certificate from the trusted source certificate page, which is a page dedicated for Root/Intermediary CA certificates. So the config doesnt make sense. It&#x27;s like the ISE is saying to the syslog server, Hi syslog server I am some upchain CA server, we good?
 If you read the Cisco ISE documentation in the link below, under the section heading &quot;Configure Secure Syslog Remote Logging Target&quot;, it states, step 12:
 &quot;Choose the CA certificate that Cisco ISE must present to the secure syslog server from the Select CA Certificate drop-down list.&quot;
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_basic_setup.html
 So you are forced to present a CA certificate, even though we don&#x27;t use the ISE as a CA server. So how are you supposed to use a a regular system certificate to present itself to the syslog server?

                              <span>I recently started working in market intelligence for a tech company and I need some resources to understand the high level networking business. By high level I mean (eg. if we talk about WLAN, we segment the business based on enterprise access points which are further segmented to indoor and outdoor and then by generation) I want to understand the use case and the terminology used in SD-WAN, Campus Switches, Data Center Switches, SASE. 
 Any advice on how to start would really help me (a lot)

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been troubleshooting a call center getting &quot;ICE Collection timeout&quot; messages from AWS. They are using AWS connect. So far it&#x27;s just this one site that has been having these issues and I&#x27;ve been troubleshooting this for about 3 months now along with various network seniors in the company. We&#x27;ve been on calls with AWS and everyone else which brings me now to the minds here at reddit.
 This particular site hasn&#x27;t been upgraded to Cisco SDWAN yet and is currently running GETVPN. At the beginning of this month we had our ISP (AT&amp;T) Upgrade the links from 100mbps to 250mbps links with no change in ICE errors.
 People who work from home don&#x27;t see the errors but the vpns they have on the laptops use the split tunneling.
 Yesterday I chatted with the ISP (AT&amp;T) and got reports from them about their links as well as did various tests from our datacenter to the site and everything came back clean. I cleared the counters yesterday at the site as well as rebooted the entire network about a month ago. We really haven&#x27;t seen anything to indicate a network issue besides call center reporting ICE errors. 
 From the AWS side they&#x27;ve pretty much pointed back at our network.
 So, what are your alls thoughts or questions I could look into to help?
 Thanks.

                              <span>What is everyone using for DNS HA Load Balancer?
 I would like to have 2 front-end public dns ha load balancers distributing requests to 4 back-end public dns servers.
 If read that HAProxy can do HA Load Balancing but that’s only for TCP applications. Since DNS mainly runs on UDP is there something similar for it? 
 I’ve tried Nginx proxy setup for UDP and it would work for about 100-200 requests but for public resolutions of 2-5k it can’t handle the load as it doesn’t respond fast enough.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a setup where I&#x27;m trying to achieve the following:
  
Juniper MX204 with JunOS 21.4R3 (AS65001) as EVPN gateways
 Mellanox SN2700 with Cumulus Linux 5.4 as spine (AS65100)
 Proxmox node with Frr 8.5.1 as hypervisor
  
All works fine, the Juniper, Cumulus and Proxmox nodes can ping eachother IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses just fine.
 The problem is that the EVPN MACs aren&#x27;t installed in the MAC databases of the Frr and JunOS routers.
 JunOS  JunOS works, but Frr  JunOS doesn&#x27;t,

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading through technical documents provided by a wholesale broadband provider and would appreciate assistance with understanding how this works.
 The wholesale broadband provider operates an LAC. I&#x27;m trying to understand how you would configure LNS, eBGP etc. Assuming I have only 1 tunnel end point:
  
 Domain Name Tunnel End Point Addresses (/32) 
  
 broadband.example.com 1.1.1.241/32 
 
 And here is my eBGP info:
  
 eBGP Peers (2 Per Resilient Link) 1.1.1.240/30 
  
  1.1.1.244/30 
 
 And address range to eBGP peer mappings:
  
 Address Range (LNS) Corresponding eBGP Peer 
  
 1.1.1.0/24 1.1.1.240/30 
 
 My Questions:
  
Can my tunnel end point address be the same as my eBGP peering address?
 Can my LNS be within the BGP peering range?
  
I may be completely misunderstanding this so if someone could provide a sort of summary of what all this means I&#x27;d be grateful. Thanks!

                              <span>Just checking my thought process here I have a business ISP router that&#x27;s got a 4G Failover that links to that router only. I do not want double NAT though and want the firewall to handle all this.
 So is it ok in this scenario to put the ISP router in DMZ mode to the firewall? In a way it just then acts like it&#x27;s not there and as if it&#x27;s just a WAN?
 Is my thought process correct?

                              <span>Probably very basic for y&#x27;all, but I need your inputs if there is a better way to do this.
 As the title said, we have 2 separate networks.
 Each have their own firewall/router.
 Each network have their own ISP.
 How to use the ISP of the other network as backup internet in case main internet goes down?
 (Sometimes will use the backup internet while main internet is still active, but not all the time) 
 Kindly refer to the images below.
 This is basically my question:
 The_Problem 
 This is my initial Plan:
 Is_this_a_Stupid_Idea? 
 I can&#x27;t wrap my head around this.
 ISP Modems using PPPoE so I can&#x27;t directly connect the other Network&#x27;s firewall to it.
 So I guess I have to put something in between the ISP Modem and the firewalls, to do the NAT.
 But it feels like it just adds to latency and more devices, plus more point of failures.
 I feel like there is a better way. 
 Hope somebody can suggest. Don&#x27;t flame me. :D

                              <span>A few team members regularly take notes in notepad as .txt files. These are often scratch notes that never get turned into process documentation even though they should. 
 Others use a bland looking Word document template. 
 We have a file share and a SharePoint Wiki that just acts as a second repository for our documents. Seriously, we dump .docxs and .pdfs into both places and hope someone will see them. 
 Not everything feels like it should be in a Word document. If I&#x27;m ever writing some CLI syntax, word just feels wrong. If I&#x27;m writing configurations out as part of a process of provisioning template, word feels wrong. I like Markdown a lot, but I don&#x27;t have a good way to share these files or make them collaborative. They also don&#x27;t have a lot of theming or &quot;pretty&quot; features to them, which can be seen as a upside and downside. 
 How can I, without becoming our &quot;documentation person&quot;, improve how my team documents things? Right now, people either document things poorly, or not at all because we just don&#x27;t have any good methods of documenting things. Nobody has ever seemingly taken the time to improve how we document.

                              <span>Hi. I would like to understand what the pure theoretical way to use different bands would work. 
 If I have a single large room, and at each end is an AP. I have users with PC/laptop/phone that want maximum speed (Wireless AC/AX). I have smart devices in the area, that just need a tiny message to start and stop (Wireless N). 
 In regards to best radio interference, theory. What would be the best config? 
 Can I set the N to 20Ghz. Then tell the AC/AX to use only the 40/50Ghz range, not 20? 
 Would that be the pro way to set up a simple system? Thanks for any tips. Cheers.

                              <span>My company is looking to implement RPKI. I&#x27;ve read some of the RFCs as well as plenty of blog posts. We are a very small team and do not have time to implement route origin validation using available OSS. I&#x27;m looking for a vendor to manage the implementation for us.
 Does anyone have recommendations?
 I found just one so far, has anyone worked with this company - Defensor Cloud? Looks like a startup and doesn&#x27;t even have an updated website.

                              <span>I have a spine leaf vxlan environment (Cisco 9k using nxos) using evpn for the control plane. On my border leafs I have an aggregate network in BGP to advertise network summary to edge firewalls, but want to block that summary from advertising to downstream leafs (downstream leafs have two /25 networks, I agg them to one /24 and advertise to FW). I’ve created an export route map on the vrf context on border leafs matching the aggregate prefix to block, but it is still being advertised. I am able to block the prefix on import maps at downstream leafs but want to block at source. Can I get another pair of eyes on my config? I am still fairly new to evpn so I may be missing something simple or fundamentally misunderstanding how this works.

                              <span>I want to set up a redundant infrastructure with two RADIUS and Fileservers and wanted to use Kemp Load Balancer free, though the throughput is only 20mbit.
 My question: The load balancer, as I understand, only handles the initial connection/handshake, correct? So 20 mbit should be sufficient I guess? 
 If not, I would switch to the integrated Windows Server Load Balancer.

 Appreciate any suggestions!

                              <span>Does anyone have experience or know how a Linux machine can reply to UDP-JITTER probes sent from Cisco router that works as IP SLA sender? so that Cisco router can calculate all the KPIs? or if there is some kind of application/package that can do this.

                              <span>We have a two Linux devices on VMware ESXi hosts, if I ping from the console of either to a internal device (Server, PC, Printer or gateway) I get the normal Ping response.
 If I ping externally to 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 /Google.com /bbc.com, second ping is a DUP!, I have done a packet capture on the LAN interface of the firewall.
 No. Time Source Destination Protocol Length Info
 1 0.000000 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;63 (no response found!)
 2 0.000060 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;63 (reply in 3)
 3 0.003472 8.8.8.8 172.16.4.5 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) reply id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;117 (request in 2)

 Then the process repeats, I&#x27;m note sure I&#x27;m reading this right but it looks to me that the fist ping does not respond in time so it sends a second then the first one responds then followed by the second and that is seen as a DUP!.
 I have built a clean raw install of Ubuntu 22.04 (i think) on a different ESXi host and date store, but it does the same after first login and is still doing it after the system is upgraded.
 There are no duplicate MAC addresses on the VMWare.
 There are no Duplicate IPs in use
 My next step is to install Ubuntu to a laptop and hardwire it to the network on the same VLAN.
 Can anyone make any other suggestions that would help diagnose this issue.
 Thanks Simon

                              <span>Hello guys!
 I have had multiple attempts on establishing a L2L IPsec tunnel using certs that I installed on both ASA firewalls using NDES SCEP from a Windows Server 2019 AD CS VM. The certs are RSA 2048 based with SHA 512 signature. I tried both IKEv1 and IKEv2, the tunnels work perfectly if I switch to PSK, but when I use certs, for example with IKEv2, it gets stuck in IKE_AUTH step. FW1 sends the fragmented cert to FW2 and FW2 sends a response and then after a few seconds they start negotiating again.
 If you guys need wireshark captures or configurations, let me know. I also tried both policy based and route based tunneling using VTI, same result.
 Thanks.

Looking at the dashboard it really doesn&#x27;t give me a lot of information to work with and it is very difficult to run a packet capture because it happens so randomly. Is there a better way to approach this issue or a proper technique to troubleshoot this. I am planning to setup a Linux DHCP server, I am thinking it might be related to Windows environment. If that doesn&#x27;t work I am planning to setup DHCP services within our core switch since all of our Meraki switches are just L2. Feel free to share any suggestions or tips how I can go about troubleshooting this.

                              <span>I work at a university and we have an newer outdoor athletics facility that has fiber ran to each corner of the facility. The boxes are built into the ground so that they&#x27;re inconspicuous. The issue is that each winter they fill up with water, it ruins the GFI switches to the power inside and the fiber that comes into a second smaller box located inside still gets filled with water and gets dirty. They were barely able to host the event this year due to this issue but it&#x27;s been a recurring problem for the 3 years the facility has been built. 
 So my understanding of the setup is: fiber from a pressbox to a subterranean enclosure, fiber goes into that box into a smaller grey box that does something I don&#x27;t understand, we then bring a switch that we keep inside a pelican case over and plug the fiber from the small grey box inside the subterranean enclosure into the switch, then all the necessary devices plug into the switch using ethernet. The water is getting into the small grey box and breaking things each winter.
 I don&#x27;t know enough about networking to hold an eduacated converstation on the topic with you all but I just got out of a meeting with some people that presented me with a solution to this issue that I didn&#x27;t like. They admitted they don&#x27;t know how other places do it so we&#x27;re all kinda hunting for solutions to this issue. They want something above ground but since it&#x27;s an athletics facility that would require a box right on the edge of a playing field which presents competitive, asthetic and safety concerns. 
 Is there a box or setup of some kind that can be left in an underground enclosure that would be able to stay dry for a number of years? I asked if there wasn&#x27;t a way to cap the fiber cable coming into the subterranean enclosure with a cap that was waterproof then just bring the boxes and switches for the events each time but they said there&#x27;s no cap that would keep it clean enough. 
 Any thoughts or solutions would be appreciated!

So far devices on the new vlan I created on 10.1.7.x are able to ping the switch and the vlan gateway, but they cannot reach any other part of the network or outside wan.

                              <span>I have a Metro E circuit where the provider is blocking certain protocols so I lashed up a VxLAN configuration to get around the blocking. Essentially I built a L2 circuit over a L2 pseudowire that is built incorrectly on the carrier side. 
 I&#x27;m very familiar with SP L2 MPLS but this is my first foray into VxLAN. The need is simple at the moment and I&#x27;m curious if I can decouple EVPN. 
 I used the following guide/chapter to get the VxLAN circuit built:

                              <span>We are remodeling the 1st floor, and I need to create a new AP map. 
 Current WiFi originally designed for visitor access, new design needs full floor production coverage. I have all the Meraki APs needed but it would be nice to visually map based on model. I could do this with Ubiquiti’s heatmap tool and try to reference an AP like the MR 53. 
 Any software or tools that will accept a floor plan to map? 
 Thank you for any info.

                              <span>We have a Ramtel R733 analog emergency phone we are trying to connect using a D-Link DWR-920V which is a cellular home &amp; business phone provided by US Cellular. The issue is that the R733 wants ~10vdc off-hook and the D-Link device only provides 8vdc(tested with multimeter). According to some research the R733 is pretty sensitive about voltage so it has to be pretty close to 10v for it to work.
 Is there any sort of solution that would provide the 10vdc off-hook that it needs without replacing either the emergency phone or the cellular device? We need to stick with US Cellular because we don&#x27;t want to open an account with another provider. If we did need to replace the emergency phone, are there options that would work with 8vdc? We have power in the location it is going so something that requires additional power is possible as well.

                              <span>I apologize if this is not the place to put this question but I am having a hard time finding a resource online. Basically I just want a basic template on how a dACL is writtein in ISE. We are doing a lot of port security / 802.1X and I am now deep diving into the world of dACLs. I don&#x27;t want to keep bugging my level 2 guy and would like a better understanding.
 I know there is source address and source ports etc and what keeps throwing me off is where all the &quot;any&quot; words go.
 So can you break down some of these examples?
 permit udp any any eq 123
 and
 permit tcp any range 4000 4006 any
 Any tips or info would be appreciated.

                              <span>Guys, a conceptual doubt... 
 I&#x27;m doing a lab on OSPF, BGP, VXLAN, IPv4 and IPv6 eve-ng.
 I have 2 geographically distant DCs connected via peer BGP with 2 ISPs.
 My idea is to configure VXLAN between the 2 DCs so that overlay customers can travel in their networks transparently, as if they were &quot;Regions&quot;, as it is in the public cloud.
 Speaking of IPv4, I don&#x27;t see a problem, because the customer&#x27;s network IPv4 is a non-routable IP on the internet, so I have 1 gateway in the customer&#x27;s network on each DC.
 My question is about IPv6, which is a routable IP...
 Well... basically I want to connect two IPv4 and IPv6 overlay networks of geographically separated DCs.
 I would like to talk about this issue, as many of you work with these technologies on a day-to-day basis, so I wanted to learn a little more about it.
 I couldn&#x27;t put the eve-ng topology image here, so the link is below:

                              <span>I am in a situation whereby i have mis-configured one of my miniature computers with the incorrect IP address, Gateway and DNS and this computer has since lost internet connectivity and i can no longer access it remotely to make changes to it anymore. I cannot reset it to factory default because it does not have such a function to do so. The device always dials back to a remote web site where i use it to make changes to it. 
 My question is, what can i do, to allow this miniature computer with the incorrect static IP addresses to regain internet access so that i can configure it online.
 ​
 Would connecting it to another computer with internet connection and bridge the ethernet port to the wireless ethernet enable the miniature computer to regain internet access?

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t used a Cisco Wireless controller in over a decade. New job just had a pair of 9800s installed in load balancing mode. I do not see anywhere that you can find the connected device statistics. On the dashboard, I see the top APs by data usage, but I can&#x27;t drill down. I went through all the menu items and I cannot see any individual device statistics. 
 Am I blind?
 Running Version 17.3.4c for reference
 Edit: to be clear, I was looking to sort clients by data usage. For example, one AP is in a remote location, but is in the top 3 APs by data usage. I would like to see what is using so much data on that AP.

                              <span>We have a few larger projects coming up that involve quite a few unfamiliar elements. I&#x27;m working on planning the processes out, but am having a hard time organizing my information. We&#x27;re an Atlassian shop, but I find Confluence a bit too unstructured for this, and using Jira would involve a lot of effort for something that might change frequently.
 Do any of you have favorite or useful tools for this type of planning? I don&#x27;t need actual project management tools as things like dates or timelines are a bit premature at this point. I feel something like a Gantt chart without the timeline would be helpful--just tracking dependencies and breaking things into subtasks.

                              <span>Currently going down a huge rabbit hole.
 I live in a town that&#x27;s between 2 other towns. It&#x27;s a weird grey area. The town to my left has a great wide cable internet connection, and the town to the right has a vast fiber connection. However, my town has basically nothing. No cable, no fiber, only 1 WISP that is just awful. Purely LOS, unstable connection, lower than 10mbps down, 0.5 up. It&#x27;s terrible. The company has been sold twice, and still zero improvement, or care to improve.
 It&#x27;s been like this forever, there&#x27;s never been a good internet company here, and there never will be (for a long time at least).
 I have to rely on cellular internet, which isn&#x27;t even viable for the others in this town because it&#x27;s not as simple as Verizon Home Internet or T-Mobile home internet, it&#x27;s not offere…</span>

                              <span>So i am looking for a swiss army knive like USB-Stick solution. I want to use Ventoy with it to store different ISOs, and store different handy tools. So my 2 questions are: 1. How to make sure to have the most recent installer for the different tools. Can I automate this?
  
Is an USB-Stick the best solution or is a M2 SSD for external use better in this case?

                              <span>Is the ironport esa still relevant? Lately we have been seeing some pretty blatant phishing emails get through the appliance and it appears to be missing some rather malicious files. I’m wondering if the appliance is still relevant, or if others have had similar experiences? 
 Anyone have feedback when comparing the ironports to proofpoint or other options nowadays? Thanks for any feedback /insight!!!!

I&#x27;m not interested in which OEM everyone loves but more so what is part of your decision making process when it comes to purchasing? I&#x27;ve always been of the opinion that today&#x27;s average desktop is WAAAAY overpowered for what an average worker needs that&#x27;s just running Office or editing an occasional PDF which is what most of our users do. How does your org decide things like minimum CPU, RAM, HD size, etc. ?

                              <span>I have a standard 19&quot; 42U server rack with EIA square holes.
 Some of my mounting rails with 10-32 threaded holes are meant to be screwed directly into the square holes. The rail sits flush on the rear face of the post and the screw goes directly into the threaded hole from the front, no cage nut, right through the square opening.
 They came with these 10-32 screws with a low profile flat head (the shape, not the socket) and a wide diameter head to cover up most of the square hole and provide a secure fit.
 The manufacture doesn&#x27;t sell any extras, and when I search for 10-32 server rack screws, I just get a bunch of regular ones with big domed heads. I need them to sit as flush as possible to the mounting posts.
 Is there a specific name for this style of screw, and are they readily available from common suppliers like CDW for example?
 Thanks in advance.
 ps. In general, just buying new mounting rails while it is the obvious solution, is not possible in this situation, I&#x27;m an academic researcher and I can&#x27;t really allocate funds for something that has already been done, especially when it still works. I just need some more screws.
 Edit: Thank you to u/St0nywall for figuring out I needed some 1421 mounting hardware by hammond. Life saver.

                              <span>No right answer I guess and obviously this isn&#x27;t the default setting.
 Most linux VMs or vendor &quot;appliance&quot; OVFs usually have open-vm-tools so I guess my question is aimed primarily at Windows VMs.
 What do you do and why?

                              <span>Basically what the title says. We have been remediating some vulnerabilities that were found by the cyber risk management platform our insurance company uses. 
 I provided some evidence to remove a vulnerability found and the support team warned us that any “HTTPS exposure” coming from the SonicWALL is on the radar of insurance carriers as a potentially uninsurable asset. The recommendation is to move to an alternative firewall solution such as Cisco, Cloudflare, etc. 
 Anybody have any insight on why this is?

                              <span>So I might have a domain example.com that I expect to send mail. I will configure an SPF record appropriate for this. Fine.
 But if I have a subdomain sub.example.com that does not send mail, is it best practice to explicitly configure an SPF record on this subdomain to state that it does not send mail?
 I can&#x27;t find any specification that explicitly recommends or states this. I can however find specs recommending to configure one for root domains that do not send mail

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 I want to create a culture of &quot;don&#x27;t fuck with IT&quot; at my 90 person org. We get endless emails, texts, and teams messages with &quot;my lappy doesn&#x27;t know me anymore&quot;. Or a random badge with a sticky note on my desk &quot;dude left&quot; and laptops covered in sticky shit and crumbs with a sticky note &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.
 ​
 How do I set a new precedence? I want a strict ticket template that must be filled out before defining that IT has actually been contacted.
 ​
 Does anyone have a template or an example email memo that can help me down this path?
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>As of now, Drobo is no more. 
 Even now, I still see Drobo devices still in use on occasion. I&#x27;d look at finding a replacement whenever possible, just because their BayondRAID format is not open, and if the enclosure dies, it will take sending the data to OnTrack to recover it.
 Ages ago, they were an innovative company, where RAID on the desktop was a useful thing. However, they never really made anything big after that, other than an iSCSI target, and eventually NAS models. Synology and QNAP eventually ate their lunch.
 In any case, time to decommission any Drobo storage appliances in use.
 Edited: This includes Retrospect, so if one is using Retrospect for backups, time to find a VAR and find a replacement ASAP.

 Got in a MSP 6 months ago. We basically have to tell our hierarchy absolutely EVERYTHING we do. It makes sense your superior doesn&#x27;t want to see you watching Youtube videos when you&#x27;re supposed to be working, but here&#x27;s the thing : to clock your time in, you have to take your time spent on a ticket and do a formula to convert it. Then we use a fucking old version of Navision to report our time, it&#x27;s slow and clunky. 
 Some days we are extremely busy so we don&#x27;t have enough time to report everything we do, then next month comes, higher-ups see the numbers and say &quot;you&#x27;ve reported nothing! You didn&#x27;t work at all this month&quot; yeah of course asshole I spent more time actually working instead of trying to show you that I do work.
 ...Couldn&#x27;t they just let us live? Is it like this where you all work?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Curious to how you are managing users such as devs that need local admin to do their jobs effectively?
 Read about each dev machine having their own &quot;dev vm&quot; environment where they are full admins and other similar segregation methods.
 We are doing some Cyber security certs at the moment and I need to prove people aren&#x27;t using admin accounts with access to the internet or email and I&#x27;m struggling to fathom how to manage 30 devs when there&#x27;s only me as the primary IT resource. 
 I use Intune to manage all workstations.
 Thanks

                              <span>I do not want a fucking headshot included in my email signature. It just weirds me out and it’s quite an unusual practice…
 I have raised this concern and it hasn’t been taken seriously. I think the email signatures are being centralized on Microsoft 365 and will not be in anyone’s control except for IT.
 Is there a way to get around using something like that or what? Is it just automatically applied to every email and you can’t do anything?

                              <span>Just needed to rant a bit. I have gone through 4 account managers in two years thus far. Each of them start out so enthusiastic and very prompt but, it&#x27;s like a trend for them to fall off over time. I&#x27;m dealing with one account manager now that has not responded since May 11th with any useful information. It&#x27;s like they do not want to do any work, unless they are making a sale. The hardware lately has also been bad, maybe I just get lemons. I have been using Dell more and more, shooting for Lenovo too soon. Anyone else experience this with HP?

 We have MFA and conditional policies in-placed but they were still able to bypass that? Any thoughts on this? How would we combat this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been noticing a significant increase in computers encountering login issues recently, specifically due to either an unavailable domain or a failed trust relationship. I work at an MSP and have come across this problem across multiple clients lately, so its not just an issue with one specific domain. While it&#x27;s a relatively easy fix to log in as a local admin and redomain the machines, the fact that this error keeps cropping up more frequently makes me wonder if there&#x27;s something Microsoft might have messed up.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a 2012R2 Server (not domain-joined) that I recently patched and it seems like that while the issue started shortly after, other 2012R2 Servers have those same patches and RDP continues to work.
 The Event ID 36888 &quot;The Windows SChannel error state is 1205&quot; is due to a TLS 1.2 handshake error and I&#x27;m wondering if you&#x27;ve every successfully resolved this and how?
 I confirmed that the Server&#x27;s self-signed\Remote Desktop SSL Certificate doesn&#x27;t expire until 9/8/2023.
 These were the patches I applied:
 April Update kb5025288
 March Update kb5023764
 February Update kb5022894
 KB5023790 
 Thank you for any help/suggestions you can offer

                              <span>I work for a car leasing company and they *insist* on having a dedicated mailbox for each major customer, and the appropriate customer support representative have access to it. Sounds good on paper but this process has gone unchecked for many years and now users have 20+ shared mailboxes each.
 This is causing outlook to constantly break (a man can only make so many new outlook profiles) as they are trying to use it as a CRM tool. 
 I have not got enough authority to implement a CRM so my question is this: What are some alternative solutions to this problem? 
 I have though about each team having a shared mailbox, with an alias for each of their respective customers. As well as caching only 6 months emails to help aleviate the strain on .psts.
 Another option would be adding members but disabling auto-mapping off, forwarding all emails into a team mailbox and the users then simply change who they are sending as.
 Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

                              <span>So 12 years of dedicating oneself to a single company has come to an end. Putting up with doing first to third line, fixing a server with a full disk to someone’s teams not integrating with outlook. 
 The last company was the straw that broke the camels back, I’m all up for doing multiple things in our line of work but expecting 3 peoples jobs from one person is too much, only hearing problems from people for years has broken me. 
 Moving onto contract work now, let’s see how different that is? I like the concept of having a set job to do and when it’s done that’s it, no expecting more or anything but also what kind of shit show will you be walking into ?

                              <span>I have a question please. 
 What can I show to prove that I didn’t receive an email from the Home Office? 
 The home office denied my application for indefinite leave to remain because they claim that they had earlier sent me an email requesting for information and that I hadn’t responded. I checked my email and nothing came in from the home office either on the date they say they sent the email or any other date for that matter. 
 Thank you very much

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 While testing an update from PDF24 Creator (9.x to 11.12.0) I found out that the registry paths has changed (as written in their documentation). This leads to missing printers in PDF24 Creator although they are shown as local installed printers.
 But the printers aren&#x27;t working.
 ​
 I searched the web for a solution to keep the printers after updating but found nothing at all.
 Therefore I post this solution so anyone who didn&#x27;t do that update because of this behavior can update now without reinstalling the printers.
 ​
  
open regedit.exe as admin
 search for HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Serviceshere are all PDF printers - each one got a folder (i.e. 1A2B34CDEZ)
 right click the folder and export it as .reg
 edit the exported .reg with notepad
 change the key pathfrom HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Services\1A2B34CDEZto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PDF24\Services\1A2B34CDEZ
 install the new version (auto deploy, manually, whatever) and reboot afterwards
 open regedit.exe as admin -&gt; Data -&gt; import -&gt; import .reg files
 reboot your device
 open PDF24 creator settings -&gt; printers -&gt; printers must be shown now and working properly
  
​
 It is that easy.
 ​
 Could be working for automation as well - I didn&#x27;t try it for the few devices.
 ​
 Best wishes

                              <span>Preparing to move a customer from our Hyper-V 2019 cluster to a new Hyper-V 2022 cluster, we build a new cluster with three Hyper-V 2022 hosts. Created the port profiles, the logical switch and logical networks through SCVMM. Placed a test VM on the cluster, made it high available and when powering on it triggered a blue screen on the host. Then the 2nd host noticed host nr1 is down and took over the VM, tried to power it on and then also BSODed. Then host nr 3 took over and also BSODed, etc, etc....
 The BSOD screens al show vmswitch.sys as the cause of the BSOD. We&#x27;re using Cisco blades and firmware / drivers are all at the level requested by Cisco. Windows 2022 is a fresh install with all the latest updates applied.
 My guess is maybe the UCS policy for the nics is not correct. VMQ settings? RSS? RSC? And this causing a BSOD because a conflict in settings???? 
 Can&#x27;t find any Cisco docs about specifically Windows 2022 Server Hyper-V on UCS.
 Any tips?

                              <span>Hi,
 Can anyone advise, the best way to set up an internal DNS deployment without any local compute? We have an AWS account which is connected via s2s vpn to local site. 
 Is it just to run a bunch of EC2 instances with BIND installed? I’m just wondering if I can leverage private hosted zones in R53 some way as we already use this for DNS management.
 TIA!

                              <span>As the subject says... but with a bit more detail. I&#x27;m looking for recommendations on:
  
Simple monitoring solution that can be installed on Linux
 Can be configured to monitor SNMP hosts
 Can import vendor specific MIB files (probably should go without having to say)
 Everything about the install/configure can be downloaded and installed in an air-gapped network (ie. packages, docker images, ova&#x27;s, etc)
 Email alerting
  
There&#x27;s lots of options out there for sure, Cacti, Nagios, LibreNMS, Zabbix, etc... I just need to quickly get something stood up that can start recording sensor (temp/power/fanspeed) values of some of our server hardware equipment.
 Bonus points if it can also be configured as a syslog server to be able to record and alert on activity logs.
 I know it&#x27;s a long shot but I figured I&#x27;d ask what folks are using.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been offered a sysadmin job at a small company where I would be the only IT/sysadmin person. My skills are more in software engineering, but the job was offered to me and thought I&#x27;d take it. The company heavily relies on Azure and the M365 suite for most things including MDM, but even with all of that functionality, there are 30+ applications/software/systems external to the M365 suite that I have to learn how to use and offer support for. I recently found out that the person who is currently the sysadmin is leaving probably a week after I join and has to pass all this knowledge on to me in that time, which I already know isn&#x27;t going to happen. Personally , it&#x27;s an immense amount of pressure on me being the only person who would have the role of a IT Technician/Sysadmin, especially when someone comes to you with a problem and lurks over you as they expect you to fix it there and then. Any suggestions on what I can do to make my life easier when starting this role and relieve some of the pressure? This is my first sysadmin job, not a massive noob, but I do lack experience though. Thanks :D

 I have a backup file of a server that I want to perform a checkdisk on.
 Now before I do that, because it holds valuable data, I was wondering what the best practice would be for creating a backup/local copy of that backup file.
 Is it safe to just use windows copy and paste or robocopy? Or is there a better way to copy that file? 
 Thanks!

In the past this folders never gave this problem. Access is also no problem. Today we noticed that a couple of desktop apps that are auto starting on a Windows Server did not start due to an exception (Exception Info: System.UnauthorizedAccessException). Starting the app as Administrator solves the startup. Anybody else seen this behaviour? Ii checked the UAC and that is not causing this.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and we will be dropping Cisco in the near future.
 We use Cisco firewalls (with ASA OS, not Firepower) mainly for their excellent VPN client, AnyConnect.
 What alternative firewall has the best VPN for end users?
 In sequence of importance we care about the following in a VPN solution:
  
Stability (shouldn&#x27;t drop the connection at first sign on network trouble)
 Support for 2FA
 Ease of use for end-user
 Ease of pushing new config to client
 Ease of initial installation
  
(The reason we are dropping Cisco is primarily because they have become impossible to deal with for SMB. We spend way too much time on licensing and contract renewal.)

                              <span>Hi!
 I just took over a super old setup and started digging through it all step by step. 
 I just came across some errors in the event log stating that a couple of certificates have expired back in 2020 and haven&#x27;t been renewed automatically. In this case it is on the primary DC holding all FSMO roles etc which is also CA.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience in this particularfield, so just want to be sure that I don&#x27;t break anything by just using the certificate renewal wizard to renew it, either with a new key or using the same key? :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>How does everyone approach patch management with software that lacks auto updates?
 Such as software you have to download an installer and run it as admin to update.
 You obviously can&#x27;t trust users to be able to handle this, it&#x27;s providing an open door to the system.
 At work we&#x27;re dealing with several peices of software that lacks auto updates across about 400 users. 
 The only solutions we can think of is manually remoting in and updating the software or giving certain members of staff admin access such as managers to run the install.
 Thoughts?

 &quot;I am trying to monitor Hyper-V and its VMs. I&#x27;ve tried using this template (https://github.com/a-schild/Zabbix-HyperV-Templates) to discover the VMs and their items, and it successfully discovered the VMs. However, the discovery rule to detect CPU, RAM, services, disk, and other metrics of the VMs did not work.
 So, my question is: Is there any other template available that I can use to monitor Hyper-V and its VMs, or do I need to install the Zabbix agent in each VM?&quot;
 Thanks.

                              <span>Dear fellow sysadmins, I&#x27;ve encountered something rather strange which I haven&#x27;t yet seen before and I&#x27;m unsure on how to resolve it / find the cause. I write this in the hopes that someone can point me in a direction where I might be able to find out more about the issue.
 System is running Windows 10 22H2 build 19045.2965, browser is Firefox v113.
 To the issue itself:
 When I try and reach https://www.\[domainname\].com it gives me an error and says &quot;Access Denied&quot; &quot;You don&#x27;t have permission to access &quot;http://www.\[domainname\].com/&quot; on this server.&quot;
 Which I find highly suspicious because being redirected to an http site might pose an security risk, which is why I believe the client/DNS cache and thus the system itself might be compromised... It&#x27;s only this one specific site that yields the issue.
 Have any of you encountered something like this? I&#x27;ve disabled all the browser&#x27;s addons, but to no avail. Just ran in-depth malware check on the system, but it yielded no detection at all...
 Any ideas what to do next/what to look for?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am facing a (hopefully solvable) problem, as I cannot directly influence some things. The following situation:
 Domain A is managed by DFN. The web server for domain A was provided by my employer. Due to lack of staff, web server provisioning has been discontinued. We received a backup before the shutdown. The administration of domain A should remain with DFN.
 We then purchased Domain B from STRATO, including the web server. There we imported the backup and made the site available again.
 Domain A is well known by everyone and appears high up in Google. Therefore domain A should be redirected to domain B without an underlying web server. The support at DFN has entered the IP address of the web server of STRATO for domain A, which appears by a ping. However, STRATO can apparently not process this request, so that when the IP is called, simply a &quot;Not found&quot; appears.
 The support at DFN has no idea, and I do not know enough about the subject. He said that this is due to the configuration of the web server at STRATO.
 How do I get the problem solved?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi, users are reporting that since this month&#x27;s update they have trouble logging in when the screen locks. IT discovered the reason is when the screen locks, the keyboard layout doesn&#x27;t default back to English like it normally did but stays at the current language being used. Users&#x27; passwords are always &quot;English&quot; since that&#x27;s what the keybord layout normally defaults on the lock screen. So they keep getting wrong password, until they mouse over to change the layout.
 I tested and it seems to be affecting Windows 10 (22H2) only. Windows 11 works as expected. Anyone else seeing this? All of our users use multiple layouts and it&#x27;s causing a lot of grief.

                              <span>Dear all,
 We have an incident with 2 RICOH SP 4510 DN printers because we can&#x27;t connect on the WEB interface of this one.
 The customer has many other RICOH models and no problem but the problem persists only with these 2 printers of the same model.
 There is no network blocking because the printer / workstations / print server is in the same subnet (We have checked anyway).
 We have updated the firmware of the 2 printers.
 We have reset both printers to factory settings.
 We have contacted RICOH support but they don&#x27;t help us much.
 We have reset the remote certificates on both printers.
 When we want to access the WEB interface, the error message is &quot;ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED&quot; as if the printer refused the connection.
 In the Ricoh firmware update software, the error message is &quot;Failed at TLS communication&quot; but there is no blocking at the network level and we can update the Firmware with no problem.
 This happens only with these 2 printers, for all other RICOH it&#x27;s ok everything works fine.
 In short, we have done everything but nothing to do unfortunately.
 Has anyone had a similar case / can anyone help us with this ?
 Best regards,

                              <span>I’m an IT manager at a small university. A user in our physics department has a Precision 3460 that was installed by my predecessor. In order to “increase security” on this box, the user decided to set both the system and admin passwords … and now has forgotten both. 
 After this machine is reformatted to its initial factory state, I’m going to have to hunt down all these machines and make sure users can’t get into the BIOS. 
 But I’ve never encountered quite this situation before. It used to be you could take out the CMOS battery for 30 seconds or so and the password(s) would be wiped. Not so, apparently, for the 3460. Googling and product manual searches yielded no help, so I’m appealing here for assistance. 
 Any ideas, folks?

                              <span>I had an on-site audit yesterday (account wasn’t old enough yet) and woke up a bit late. Heading there I wasn’t the most civil driver and when I was close to work I flicked off some slow driver that was clearly confused and wasting my time. I pulled into the parking lot and headed for the door only to see the offender pulling into out parking lot. Less than 15 minutes later we were introduced, turns out this man is our auditor. After a grueling day, I can only hope we pass. Felt like a lot of his findings were extra for some reason, no clue why… Don’t be like me, drive calm. 
 Anyone else have similar experiences? It’ll be a while before I live this down.

                              <span>Hi. Last year, I got an opportunity to work as Network security on a 1 year contract. Since I joined, my colleagues never liked me (they have been there for 15+ years and expected me to do what they tell me to do rather than working as a team). However, my manager have always been supportive of me and understood the dynamics of how my colleagues would underpin me being the new guy. Now my position became a full time but i have to reapply like all other applicants. Recently my manager hinted that someone else applied internally and he seems to be a good fit as he got along well with my current team and that guy has been referred from top management. And he suggested if I would be okay to continue working for another 1 year contract. I felt bad and hurt as I invested in couple of certs in this job hoping my hard work and my certs would make me a good candidate once the position becomes full time. My manager told me he likes how I am always calm and thoughtful and he told me to think about his plan. I didn’t express my emotions or said anything when he told me this news. Now should I tell him I was hoping to get this full time and hoping to be part of this company growing up the ladder. Or should I just stay silent and start applying elsewhere?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious, and have no idea of best practice here. In a Windows-centric environment where there are also a couple of Linux servers (Debian mostly), do you join the Linux servers to AD and use the AD-based admin accounts to administrate the Linux servers?

 On top of that I&#x27;ve been ringfenced for urgent project work for the rest of he week, and boss has said no excuses this &quot;must be top priority&quot;.
 I could:
 A) break my back with extra hours and try and pick off the urgent incidents while doing the project in the day job.
 B) work my regular hours, let SLAs fail and let the world burn.
 I&#x27;m going with option B this week, tough love. We have been a person down for 18 months while management say thay can&#x27;t find the right candidates, we have obliged by covering the holes, but I can&#x27;t any more - simply not enough hours to fit everything in for the foreseeable. Management have to learn we can&#x27;t go on!
 Let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s the right choice, because I know complaints will be a coming in.

                              <span>Hello there fellow emergency fighters! Obviously a throwaway due to privacy concerns :)
 Today is the day it happened :) After weeks and weeks (~12 - 16) of reporting fileserver issues and being told &quot;everything is fine only your team reports it and it happened twice now, meh&quot;. It became a bigger problem and took down our CRM, SAP and SharePoint for 2 - 3 hours which resulted in slow and terrible analysis roughly 6 weeks ago. Decisions were made, thrown away and then decided again.
 During this time the team I am part of had the main issues because automations took ages / timed out since the FS wasn&#x27;t always available or slow. 
 Guess what we learned on Friday? We didn&#x27;t create backups for the main share since end of April! Called in a contractor to go over everything and noticed bad sectors / partition starts corrupting. So tonight was supposed to be a full backup because we cannot risk anything, right???
 Well I told my team lead, who graciously got assigned on-call, that he should be prepared for dead scheduled tasks tomorrow morning or worse. He just send me a message &quot;10 people in a meeting - incl. head of infrastructure. Seemingly the partition died&quot;
 Well why have a call about a dead drive surely we deployed RAID XYZ? About that... Seems like we had 6TB of mission critical files on a single volume that was able to get completely corrupted by a single drive failure :) 
 Sure I knew that most of my coworkers aren&#x27;t topnotch but how in the devil&#x27;s name is that possible? I learned that shit in school. Legitimate feel like brushing up the CV if tomorrow turns out the way I think it will.

                              <span>So you have a business with an infrastructure supporting aging and end of life software. Your admins that know the business don&#x27;t know as much about modern systems because their full time job is supporting old stuff and doing stuff &quot;The way it&#x27;s always been&quot;.
 You know you need to modernize, so you go out to hire, but any admins with extensive experience in AzureAD, or whatever greatest trend is going, run the other direction once they learn your infra is SQL 2012R2. Who wants to step into a business 10 years in the past (and deal with the guys still there stuck in their ways)? Good admins want to have good tech.
 So you have outdated infrastructure because you can&#x27;t hire any admins that have kept their learning going. And you can&#x27;t hire any modern admins because you have outdated infrastructure.

                              <span>Hey guys, our organization is looking to add LAPS to our environment for local AD only. I have run across many guides for the older version of MS LAPS, but has anybody found or used any good guides for the new version? We are 100% Windows 10 at the moment but will be upgrading in the near future.
 I understand that most of the features are similar but that it is implemented differently, as well as being mostly integrated in Windows now. Any and all information is really appreciated. I know a lot of people have had issues upgrading, luckily, I won&#x27;t need to experience that.
 I have lots of individual questions, but a guide may answer most of them. Can anybody post your experience and references?
 Thanks guys.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been working in IT doing a mix of sysadmin, Helpdesk, Infrastructure, and cloud-magic for about a decade now. I hate to say it but I&#x27;ve noticed that, maybe starting about 2 years ago, I just don&#x27;t care about people&#x27;s IT issues anymore. 
 Over the past decade, all sorts of people come to me with computer issues and questions. Friends, Family, Clients, really just anyone that knows that I &quot;do computers&quot; has come to me for help. It was exhausting and incredibly stressful. So I set up boundaries, over the years the friends/family policy turned into &quot;Do not ask me for any IT help what so ever. I will not help you. There is no amount of money that will make me help you. I do not want to fix your computer, I am not going to fix your computer. I do not care what the issue is, find someone else&quot;
 Clients were a bit different as they are paying me to do IT work. But after so so SO many &quot;Help! When I log in, the printer shows up 10mins late&quot; and &quot;Emergency! The printer is printing in dark grey instead of black ink!!&quot; and general &quot;USB slow, please help, need antivirus&quot; I just honestly don&#x27;t care either. 
 Honestly, I&#x27;ve noticed I barely use a computer or tech in my free time, because I just don&#x27;t want to deal with it. 
 Has this happened to anyone else? Am I turning into an asshole? Am I getting burnt out?

 Company A hired a person called Adam. Company A agreed for a BYOD employment.
 Adam has a personal ONEDRIVE account which he uses to regularly backup his PC.
 Company A wants to fire Adam! How can they be sure:
 A. Adam copied all files from his PC to a drive he was given by company A B. Adam deleted all company files from his PC. C. Adam deleted all said files from onedrive recycle bin
 10x in advance.
 EDIT: Thank you everyone for your thoughts.
 I will say that I am not connected to said company (IT wise), I was just asked to consult as an external reference.
 I&#x27;ve already told management that they are f@#ked 😉 and that they should seriously rethink their BYOD policy.
 May we all have an error free week.

 Getting some weird behavior when logging in with full desktop vs RemoteApp with the Webclient. If I log in full desktop RDP, the reg keys I put into HKCU work great but when I use RemoteApp same user, it’s not seeing those same settings.
 Are user profiles and registry (specifically HKCU) for full RDP session different than when logging in via RenoteApp?
 Is there some kind of temporary profile created for RemoteApp connections?
 I’m not using any of the RDS settings for roaming profiles.
 Thanks for any help or ideas, Dan

                              <span>So here is my scenario... I work for an MSP and we currently have a client who still has a legacy configuration of old-school roaming profiles rather than folder redirection in place.
 I have been tasked with moving their current roaming profiles over to DFS namespace via folder redirection. Currently each person&#x27;s roaming profile sits on an old file server that needs to be decommissioned and this includes everything they have ever had in their Home directories.
 With this in mind, I have used robocopy to copy over all of the data where their Home directories exist now to the new location on a new file server.
 In Group Policy Management I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out the best GPO to deploy to ensure that their home directories (which are roaming) are correctly pointed to the new DFS path along with each person still having access to all of the data that they had in their old roaming profile.
 In the GPO I made under User Configuration &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Folder Redirection I need to ensure that each person will still have access to their data in their home drive while correctly redirecting their data to the DFS path.
 It&#x27;s a confusing task to me and any input would be appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>In Linux, we can use sandbox environments such as flatpak to secure high risk apps such as web browsers against 0 day attacks. Its very good since I can basically tell it for example which folders, files can a process access, or which devices it can access (webcam, etc). 
 So Is there any similar solution in Windows that doesn&#x27;t brick the performance of the app? Meaning, securing apps such as browsers against potential 0 day RCEs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a linux guy by trade, sysadmin, devops, system programming, etc.
 Sometimes I&#x27;m asked to do stuff on windows, usually powershell, and this is one of those cases, but I don&#x27;t understand the implications of what I&#x27;m asked to do and would appreciate pointers.
 I have a bunch of fileservers, I&#x27;m sending the logs to a graylog, I&#x27;m now asked to enable granular file access auditing, which users is accessing/creating/deleting which files.
 obviously there&#x27;s a bunch of permissions already set on the fileserver shares.
 I&#x27;m now playing with a test server and found out via ms documentation that I need to enable the file system auditing policy, I&#x27;ve done that (on my test server).
 then I see I have to enable autiding on the folder I intend to audit access to.
 two questions:
 1) should I also enable the Audit File Share policy?
 https://imgur.com/a/dftoXYk
 2) when I set the auditing on a folder I&#x27;m asked a principal, type, applies to and then basic permission, it&#x27;s the basic permission that are putting me off.
 https://imgur.com/a/10ulh6D
 I mean I understand (I think), the principal/type/applies to settings, for which principal should log events be generated, for which action, and if it applies recursively.
 but why should I set permissions in this tab? am I gonna overwrite the fileserver permissions when I enable this? and what is the thinking behind setting permissions here?

                              <span>Okay so I posted a question in the cybersecurity subreddit the other day about 2 different EDR solutions. The reason for the post is we are looking to remove our MSP and bring support inhouse. Which entails replacing the security stack with something new. I was at a conference last month and found out that Acronis now plays in this space.
 The question I pose to you is have you use their solution? NGAV/EDR/Backup/Email Filtering? All or some of it? Thoughts about it? From the brief overview I had of it, it seems pretty decent but once again it was just a brief overview and in a short time you can make anything look wonderful. Its only after a decent test do you see the flaws or benefits.

                              <span>I&#x27;m helping someone overhaul their network. They have dozens of unmanaged switches. 
 We moved a few windows PCs to a managed switch, and NLA breaks (doesn&#x27;t show connected to the domain network for NLA). Connectivity is fine to all the hosts on the subnet and can access dns / domain controller just fine. The pc&#x27;s at this time are configured for static IPs. (another issue I&#x27;m trying to fix). 
 When we move the pcs back to the unmanaged switches, NLA works as expected. I tested turning off igmp snooping, but of course that didn&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t) resolve it. 
 My google foo doesn&#x27;t seem strong for this one. 
 Any suggestions?

 Appart &quot;change the workflow that you have been used to for the past 20 years on Windows and countless linux environement&quot;, does anybody know of some kind of tool to &quot;linuxify/windowsify&quot; a Mac environment ?

 And no, getting another laptop is not an option -.-

                              <span>Hi Reddit Folks!
 I currently have Gsuite for less than 20 employees, at most 20gb of files on g-drive for a single user but most are under 5gb of use, we have a bunch of alias emails, don&#x27;t utilize any social aspect of the platform. Just straight email, storage of files, and collabs on spreadsheets.
 Instead of upgrading to Google workspace basic, I was looking into Microsoft O365 business standard which seems to be comparable in pricing and usage of storage, spreadsheets.
 My concern is how easy is it to configure the new O364 business account to use the domain name for emails, migrate users emails and files, and aliases? Anything else I would be missing to ask about for a migration or gotchas?
 Luckily, the environment is small and simple but I would imagine the same solution would apply for small businesses of 50-100 employees but open to any easy work around as well.
 Thanks for your help and time as I greatly appreciate it!

                              <span>Good day!
 We have a 2 node Windows 2012 R2 File server failover cluster. We did a rolling update to 2016 basically keeping the same IP addresses.
 However, after completion, Samsung printer scan to server suddenly stopped working.
 During the test it says it lost connectivity, however same IP and firewall rule is intact. AD Audit fails to collect security logs as well.
 However, Windows client still can access the file server VIP and DFS without issues.
 Is there some local policy difference between Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016 that we can check?
 Please take note that we haven’t upgraded the cluster functional level to 2016.
 Also, reverting the cluster back to 2012 fixes the issue. 
 Thank you all in advance!

 So as Microsoft server 2012 is approaching end of life, I want to move a old server that belong to a company to a newer server version. The server is running a journal system, and a Microsoft SQL (2014) database used by the journal.
 What is the cheapest Microsoft 2022 Standard edition license i can buy that include a SQL server? Any way of making the trancition as &quot;cheap &quot; as possible? upgrading license?

                              <span>Hello all, I am looking for a way to find all the computers on my network that have only static assigned IP addresses without having to go touch every single computer. I thought about maybe writing something in PowerShell that would loop through a list of all the computers in a specific OU from AD. Has anyone done something similar? Potentially using a Linux tool?? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks

                              <span>So we have a report that used get-messagetrace that sends out a report to individuals showing how many emails were sent and how many were received for each mailbox on the previous day. 
 ​
 It works fine for emails going to or originating from external email addresses (i.e. customers), but it&#x27;s not showing emails that originate internally. We have a hybrid environment, running Exchange 2016 on-prem. 
 ​
 Any thoughts on how to get internal emails to report?

                              <span>Hi Guys, 
 I am trying to map external mapped drives (shares from a different domain server) through group policy. 
 Since Microsoft no longer offer the ability to specify login details I can&#x27;t connect to drives using the different domain. 
 The users/servers are joined via site to site vpn so can access the servers, I&#x27;m just trying to automate the process so we don&#x27;t have to manually map these every so often. 
 Is the only way to do this via a script? I have tried using a script via group policy but they don&#x27;t seem to run correctly or end up failing for no real reason. (But work when ran locally) 
 Another thing to mention is there&#x27;s 2 security groups that need access to these, which have different permissions/access for files so will need 2 separate setups for each group. (Group is held on the external server)
 I understand the best method for this would be to have connected the DCs but the client was only willing to pay for essentials and the 2nd/external server came along later. 
 Any suggestions are appreciated!

                              <span>Here is the setup, a little simplified:
 One server, 2 NICs
  
NIC 1: 192.168.251 - GW: 192.168.1.1
 NIC 2: 192.168.252 - No GW &lt;-- To keep (add same GW as above)
  
2 Internet connections (different providers):
  
Internet Connection 1: Internal IP 192.168.1.1 &lt;-- Will be shut down
 Internet Connection 1: Internal IP 192.168.1.2 &lt;-- To keep
  
NOTE: I&#x27;m working remote, and would very much like to avoid a trip on-site.
 Plan:
  
Add GW 192.168.1.2 to NIC 2
 Check everything works
 Then disable NIC 1
 Check everything still works
  
Problem:
 When I try to add GW 192.168.1.1 to NIC 2 in Step 1 above, I get:
  
Warning- Multiple default gateways are intended to provide redundancy to a single network(such as an intranet or the internet). They will not function properly when the gateways are on two separate, disjoint networks (such as one on your intranet and one on the internet). Do you want to save this configuration?
  
So here I am, needing your help 🐤
 Am I right in assuming, that I can ignore this warning and proceed?
 Thanks in advance.

 Somewhere around 2021 we started getting new reps every 6 months who don&#x27;t know anything and they just constantly try to sell us stuff. Our questions are rarely answered accurately and when they finally start to understand our needs we get a new rep. Is this happening with anyone else? Or maybe just the new norm since covid?

                              <span>We are currently having an issue with our Cisco Unity server communicating with our on prem Exchange server. Cisco TAC says that according to the logs from the RTMT that Unity is timing out when communicating with Exchange, but not every time. Voicemails seem to be coming through quickly enough but when you mark the voicemail read in outlook, the message indicator light does not clear or if it does clear, it may take 15 - 20 minutes. We haven&#x27;t found any outstanding issues on our exchange server. Any thoughts on what to check? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Our company blocked the Microsoft Store for users on their Windows 11 laptops. Within the landscape they use a vulnerability scanning tool and there is a vulnerability in the AV1 Video Extension, so an update is needed from version 1.1.52851.0 to 1.1.60961.0.
 I tried to update the app with the following options, without any luck:
  
Setting Catalog -&gt; Auto update apps in Store
 
Pro active remediation script that checks the version and if outdated, run the following:
 $namespaceName &#x3D; &quot;root\cimv2\mdm\dmmap&quot; $className &#x3D; &quot;MDM_EnterpriseModernAppManagement_AppManagement01&quot; $wmiObj &#x3D; Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespaceName -Class $className $result &#x3D; $wmiObj.UpdateScanMethod()
 
Deploy the AV1 Video Extension within Intune apps
 
Winget. Installed Winget and executed the command below:
 Winget upgrade -h --id Microsoft.AV1VideoExtension_8wekyb3d8bbwe --force
 
 Winget Output &#x3D; no applicable upgrade found, while its still on the old version.
 So i tried different things without luck. I also tried it on another laptop with the Microsoft Store available, and then i can upgrade using the command below and it will updated to the latest version 1.1.60961.0 . Whats happening here?
 $namespaceName &#x3D; &quot;root\cimv2\mdm\dmmap&quot; 
 $className &#x3D; &quot;MDM_EnterpriseModernAppManagement_AppManagement01&quot; $wmiObj &#x3D; Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespaceName -Class $className $result &#x3D; $wmiObj.UpdateScanMethod()

                              <span>Bit of a &#x27;rubber ducky&#x27; post here. I believe I&#x27;ve covered all the usual stuff before lighting candles, drawing floor markings and taking up day drinking. 
 We&#x27;ve a few servers on one host (smallish firm) and our main App is hosted on this particular 2016 VM. However, it has really thrown the toys out of the pram with updates. 
 ​
  
I&#x27;ve tried manually installing updates from the M U Catalog. Constantly getting - 0x80070490 in Event Log. 
 I&#x27;ve manually - restarted services, renamed Catroot2 and SoftwareDistribution folders, reset winsock, rebooted. 
 Tried a trusty script which does the above and more, which has worked previously for other servers and workstations (Stop services, rename folders, rename previous log, reset updates services, re-registered DLLs, cleared regkeys, reset winsock, reset BITS Transfers, and start services).
 I&#x27;ve removed AV and Malware protection just in case but that changed nothing.
  
​
 Beginning to think it&#x27;s a blow it away and start over job but that&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare with it being our main LOB app. Plus the time and costs to get the supplier to install and shift to a new VM. Usually the bottom 3 in that list of 4 has worked in my previous experiences but this just will not play ball. The other 2016 VMs are humming along nicely, 2019 all good and W10 machines all patched fine. 
 Any other ideas before I start making phone calls?

                              <span>I am not an IT guy. I understand computers, i like data, but I&#x27;m a front office guy at a financial firm. I am convinced that our back office tech and IT teams are completely incompetent, but i don&#x27;t know what to do about it.
 We have a useless website that is supposed to be a CRM, but it doesn&#x27;t integrate with a single piece of microsoft 365 (which is being paid for to be used by every single member of every firm) and theres no adobe integration to the sharepoint. Everything is done manually, by us at the front office. My job is supposed to be sales, but i spend 90% of my time doing admin. 
 Notionally, I understand how this tech is supposed to work... we pass adobe documents around for new data, which is integrated to the website via sharepoint lists, then we pull 3rd party data from APIs to fill the gaps. In practice, I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s job it should be to actually build this shit and who is responsible for the failures of the current system. 
 It seems like nobody is even speaking my language and I need to hear experts tell me that what I am envisioning is normal, its not difficult, and I&#x27;m not crazy.
 Ive taken on the mentality of &quot;if you want something done right, do it yourself&quot; to try and build little automations the best i can, but barely anything sticks. 
 Is this an lost cause? Should I simply give up and hope that my bosses hire more admin to keep this glaring issue out of sight and out of mind, or should i be concerned that without these basic process management systems in place, our business will never scale?

                              <span>Lets think about a confernce or visitors, I want a tool (webpage ideally) that I can restrict and give to certain &quot;front of house&quot; or reception staff to create temporary short term access (24hrs , 3 days etc) that provide limited services (like internet) etc, by placing them in a group in the AAD / AD (which will be defined when I setup the tool). 
 I believe I have seen a tool like this before, something they can use to create these accounts, or bulk upload too. Its then a portal the receptionist can utilise.
 Has to be idiot proof (so to speak) and be very &quot;wizardy&quot; in its simplicity. 
 Anyone know of such tools? Or recommendations?

                              <span>Yes, I am the idiot and I 100% see it. But is there ANY recovery method available to fix this?
 Basically, on a NAS there were multiple iSCSI mount points in a target LUN from a NAS. 2 mount points with the same disk space. 1 was originally mounted into a Windows server as NTFS.
 I was trying to mount the second mount point into ESXI as Datastore and realized soon enough that it was the wrong disk that got formatted. 
 Is there ANY way I can revert this and try to save the data for the NTFS volume? As this was a backup point, there are no copies for the data on this drive. I have not deleted the Datastore from the esxi as there is a warning it will try to delete all data (trying to preserve any more writes on it) :(

                              <span>Apologies if this is the wrong place. I trust the mods will let me know.
 I&#x27;m trying to get some work out from underneath me a few weeks before it&#x27;s due in order to free up my schedule and also because it would give me a considerably longer leash at work. What I&#x27;m trying to do is write out some SNMP monitoring rules for a Bosch IP camera, but I don&#x27;t have access to the device yet in order to figure out what to monitor.
 We&#x27;re using a really rudimentary SNMP monitoring system where you give it the OID and it monitors it for a response within the guidelines you give it. I wish we&#x27;d migrate to something more intelligent but you play the hand you&#x27;re dealt.
 What I&#x27;d normally do is:
  
Run an SNMP walk on the device using its MIB (which I have)
 Confirm the MIB against the walk to make sure the numbers line up
 Strip out the stuff I can&#x27;t monitor against/don&#x27;t care about
 Make the monitor using the OIDs that remain
  
Here I don&#x27;t have the device, all I have is the MIB. Looking at it, I can see that – for example – &quot;temp-sens&quot; is &quot;1.3.6.1.4.1.3967.1.1.7.1.1 &quot; , but that&#x27;s only so useful to me because I can&#x27;t tell from the MIB whether I should be expecting anything after this to denote the individual sensor (&quot;.1.1&quot;, for example).
 Loading the MIB into various freeware programs does not make this immediately apparently either.
 Is there any technowizardry I can do ahead of time to denote the various sensors on the device (or at least tell if the MIB expects them) or is the only true indication of a device&#x27;s SNMP capabilities taken from inspecting the device itself?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m looking for a company that will help us buy Lenovo laptops in India, Bangalore.
 We would be paying from the UK bank. Maybe someone knows a reseller that can help us do it faster than waiting weeks?
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve been working lately on collecting performance data for my Windows server environment.
 I am collecting various performance statistics and I have a question about a specific value for servers with Hyper-v role.
 I have a question for the value &#x27;System Current Pressure&#x27;, which is provided by &#x27;Hyper-v Dynamic Memory Balancer&#x27;.
 This value is always 100 on every server I have reviewed. I realize that the &#x27;Average Pressure&#x27; value is more important and I collect and monitor its value.
 I can&#x27;t find on Microsoft&#x27;s sites an exact description of what this parameter refers to and what it means. I checked it on a server that did not have a single virtual machine and this value is also equal to 100.
 There is also a similar value in another category &#x27;Hyper-v Dynamic Memory VM&#x27; and here the values are different for virtual machines which makes sense. Value of 100 means that the machine has reached its RAM limit and you should investigate whether to allocate more or perform optimization.
 The question is what does this value mean for &#x27;Hyper-v Dynamic Memory Balancer&#x27;?

                              <span>I head up the IT for a high turnover company in the UK. Previous to my arrival at the company a SAAS solution was purchased and at the time of purchase no administrative details were given to the business. I&#x27;ve reached out to the software company who are also based in the UK to request for administrative access to the system but they&#x27;ve refused unless we undergo a £400 3hr training course (and pass it based on their &#x27;feeling&#x27;). The system isn&#x27;t anything complicated, and our account manager is somewhat of a dinosaur and doesn&#x27;t understand the basics of the day to day regulatory requirements of running an IT service it just seems to be a bit of a &#x27;being difficult&#x27; situation. Does anyone know if there&#x27;s anything that goes against some form of legality etc if a software company that sells software to withold administrative access to the customer so they can generate more business in doing so? (ontop of a very hefty annual bill they are charging per new task).

 So, I have a couple of DELL PowerStore systems that have expired support contract, it expired mid-February, both system run old version of PowerStore OS. My question is, is it possible and/or legal to upgrade the PowerStore OS to version released BEFORE the support contract expired?
 Does anybody have any experience with such things?

                              <span>Currently looking at moving our business away from lastpass. Shopped around and looked at Bitwarden, 1Password and NordPass, but want to hear some first hand experience.
 Just for reference, only a small MSP with 3 users, and we basically only use lastpass for the shared folders feature. The amount of data we&#x27;ve got is irrelevant for moving it across as it goes back 8+ years, and a lot of is legacy stuff we basically don&#x27;t need anymore, so ease of migration isn&#x27;t a factor

Many legitimate emails with DKIM &amp; SPF aligned either get filtered to spam on our side or their side. Sometimes even being quarantined all together. The bothering part is that it happens even in mail conversations so it seems like you’ve never received an answer or invite. Do you guys experience this too and or have a solution to this?

 Thinkpad 14s is connected to Dell monitor with type-C cable. The problem is that half the times Windows 10 does not recognize monitor.
 I cannot simply add HDMI cable because next day it works again and the combo show black. I want to retain type-C for charging and data (kbd, cam, mouse) but not for display. For display I want to use HDMI cable which is 100% reliable. Disabling Thunderbolt 4 in BIOS didn&#x27;t disable video. Is there any registry value to change or device to disable.

                              <span>It appears I am back here again hoping someone can help. I am re-trying downloading the Eaton IPM VMware source from the Eaton website, but every device I try from - azure, Singapore, Australia etc - the download stops at about 330Mb with the error &quot;This download was interrupted&quot;.
 I dont think this is happening in the US - the download link is https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/products/backup-power-ups-surge-it-power-distribution/power-management-software-connectivity/eaton-intelligent-power-manager/software/ipm-version-2/eaton-ipm-vmware.zip - there wouldn&#x27;t be someone kind enough to download it for me somewhere I can collect it?
 I am also having trouble getting a trial Activation ID from the website. I only need IPM for 30 days as we go to colocation then. I&#x27;ve filled in the form for both the USA and Europe request, I get the email asking me to confirm the email address, click, but never receive the Activation ID.
 Ive spoken to support who say it is a &quot;marketing&quot; issue and they don&#x27;t know what to do. I would give my left leg and first ugly child if someone could assist.

                              <span>I do maintenance on servers late at night since it&#x27;s quiter and less disruption for people (since they are literally asleep); but I have ran into a minor issue, all of the Ubuntu servers we have are super slow to get updates from the Ubuntu repos and aren&#x27;t upgrading easily. I tried updating a Rocky Linux server and Window 2022 Server we have and they updated flawlessly. I wanted to know, is there anyone else having problems?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure how odd this will sound, but I&#x27;d like to reach out and gauge how much dev work some of you do. There is a bit of a fuzzy line with devops nowadays, as well as X as code, plus scripting is a way of writing code as well.
 So where does sysadmin end, then? I often find myself adjusting or extending the source code of FOSS Software we use as well, is this still part of a sysadmin job or have I veered over into dev territory?
 We&#x27;re a small team and there&#x27;s not a whole lot in terms of automation. And obviously no devops since we don&#x27;t have any devs. This, in combination with me being a junior/early in my career and also having had an interest in programming as a hobby has led to me feeling like I lack a proper frame of reference on what is normal for a modern sysadmin. It has also led to a severe case of double imposter syndrome as I feel like I am faking being a dev AND an admin while doing neither of the two properly.
 Are any of you in a similar position or want to share your thoughts? Should I specialise more or stick with my somewhat special &quot;stuck between worlds&quot; approach? I really love the way it makes me fit into my current team as it makes me feel like really having an impact by pushing us forward by automating and streamlining workflows. But at the same time I worry that it&#x27;ll make it extremely hard to find a new job if I have to as other employers will likely look for some kind of specialist whereas I&#x27;ve cranked the generalist knob way past 11.
 Small disclaimer: I know that usually there&#x27;s teams for different parts of sysadmin (networking, security, systems, etc) but as stated, we&#x27;re small and just a handful of people so we have to wear several hats anyway.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Wanted to bring up the topic of project management methodologies, particularly Scrum.
 I work as an operations manager part of a small IT team composed of various roles including server admin, cloud admin, network engineer, and a few helpdesk techs.
 ​
 As an infrastructure team, we are tasked with all kinds of different projects and tasks. We currently do not have any formal project management framework to work with and that causes a slew of issues including lack of focus/momentum, projects getting forgotten about, scattered priorities, and constantly jumping on the fire of the week, just to name a few.
 Recently, I started down the path of trying to implement Agile Scrum to solve our issues. I feel that the agile method of iterative progress/accomplishments will work well for us…</span>

 however i did some research and seems like engenius fit is a new product and will prob come out to similar price as the unifi install.
 is there a reason for me to run engenius fit over unifi? or should i stick with unifi?
 thx

                              <span>So I am trying to understand the need to have both on our network. 
 Currently finishing up a network upgrade that included a lot of new things, but some of the main things were adding Cisco ISE for radius and tacacs. Another part is adding wireless to our network for the first time. Wireless is all Aruba and we are using clearpass to authorize wireless clients. APs are all Aruba, and also using AIRwave.
 So basically two AAA servers. One for wireless and one for wired. 
 From my understanding, you can do wireless authentication with ISE though. ISE can authorize your wired and wireless clients, all on one device. 
 Is it really necessary to have both aruba clearpass and Cisco ISE on the network? I asked my boss why have both, and his response was so we don’t have to manually enter client mac addresses, I guess they populate when the person connects to the Wi-Fi and then we can place them into the right vlan. But in my experience, ISE does the same thing with wired clients. They get placed into a dead group not associated with a vlan, and then we can assign them to a group. But usually we have them assigned before they connect. 
 My issue with having two devices for aaa is having to manually enter macs in two different devices. We are a building that hosts a lot of short term guest with lots of BYOD devices. So we are always receiving lists of MAC addresses that get approved and need added into ISE. It can be a pain especially when getting calls because of connection issues then finding out it’s because someone can’t tell the difference between their wireless mac and wired Mac, plus typos and other errors. I just feel it’s unnecessary to have two devices if it can be handled by one. So just wondering if there is a bigger reason why clearpass and ISE are needed that I may be missing?
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m looking for 60mmWave solution to allow me to do a point-to-point solution to connect two properties we own that are across the street from each other. Curious what everyone&#x27;s experience with Cambium has been? They seem to have a following, but I&#x27;m curious what actual users think.

                              <span>Hello All, I am currently working on adding an additional GRE tunnel to a cloud vendor with the intention of filtering PC traffic over for inspection. To my knowledge there are two ways I can go about this, see below.
 ​
 Option 1. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with a higher routing priority &amp; distance which would result in the route not being active in the routing table of the Fortigate. Then create policy routes to perform the actual routing. My manager prefers to stay away from policy routes.
 Option 2. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with the same distance &amp; priority. The new route will populate in the active routing table, then create firewall policies around that static route. Please see my concerns below.
 If my Fortigate firewall has a simple LAN &gt; WAN firewall policy and the policy only includes the LAN and WAN1 interfaces and NOT the GRE tunnel inteface. If I add another 0.0.0.0/0 static route (GRE Tunnel) to my routing table with the same distance and priority. Does the Firewall start performing ECMP even though the destination interface is not included with the LAN &gt; WAN policy? I would imagine it might because of the static route being in the active routing table.
 ​
 Thanks!

 being as this is the first time we&#x27;re/i&#x27;m doing this, can you guys fill me in on common and not-so-common things to look out for when implementing bgp? like how long does this outage typically take, common troubleshooting/problem areas, etc. 
 from my very basic understanding, the routes from ISP1 will be advertised to ISP2 and vice versa to create redundancy. these new routes will have to be put in manually by all parties in their respective routers simultaneously. also, we will need a (new) /24 block to do the advertising. that&#x27;s pretty much the extent of what i know. again, it being the first time bgp-ing i can&#x27;t help but feel nervous about something that&#x27;s probably routine to a lot of you here.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into how my own ISP works. They have transit providers; wholesale downstream ethernet providers and rack space in a single datacenter from what I can see. I think it&#x27;s something like this:
 Transit ISP ---&gt; Datacenter ---&gt; Wholesale Broadband MPLS Net ---&gt; BRAS ---&gt; DSLAM ---&gt; CPE
 How does IP addressing work in a small tier 2 ISP such as this? Now this may be because of my lack of subnetting knowledge but I&#x27;m under the impression that each router interface will have a unique subnet.
 Therefore, would the subnetting look like this assuming there is no hardware redundancy (for simplicity of this example)?
  
 Transit ---&gt; Aggregation Switch A (/30) 
  
 Aggregation Switch ---&gt; Core Router B (/30) 
  Core Router ---&gt; Wholesale Ethernet MPLS C (/30) 
  Customers D (/24) Some form of NAT 
 
 If anyone has a detailed diagram of an ISP that utilizes wholesale broadband MPLS I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. Are customers generally assigned private IP addresses and then NAT is used or how does this work?
 Appreciate any advice or pointers towards resources. Thank you!

 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m in the correct place as my knowledge on these matters is limited. 
 I&#x27;m looking for a way of changing the my IP addresses to areas in the states without using traditional VPN&#x27;s. I work in the adult entertainment industry and we continually see persecution on social media platforms and regularly find ourselves IP banned. Also engagement is also much better in the US. 
 Is there a way of creating a unique VPN that relies on an IP address that isn&#x27;t widespread? The issue with some VPN providers is that the social media websites know it belongs to a VPN and we notice considerable drops in engagement and explore.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>How does port 80 and port 443 comes into picture? . Let’s say I make web application with python which runs on port 5000. Now this has http protocol which means unencrypted traffic follow and port 80 is used for encrypted traffic. So if my web server is exposed at 5000 and is handling unencrypted traffic where does port 80 comes in play ? . Same for port 443 (in this case I have a python web application with ssl or tls certificate). 
 Also Is there tool that will show the flow of traffic port to port for my python application ?

                              <span>So, we have a cluster of firewalls at a client that loose Internet connectivity every few months. Just like that. LAN continues to work but WAN goes dark. They do respond to ICMP on the WAN side but do not process user traffic. No amount of troubleshooting can bring them back up working so.. we do reboot that &quot;fixes&quot; things.
 One time, second time, and today - for the third time. 50 developers can&#x27;t work and ask why, what&#x27;s the issue? We bought industry leading firewalls, why? 
 We ran there, downloaded the logs from the devices and opened a ticket with the vendor. The answer was, for the lack of better word - shocking: 
 1) Current Firewall version XXX, we recommend to upgrade device to latest version YYY (one minor version up)
 2) Uptime 59-60 days is really high, we recommend to reboot firewall once in 40-45 days (with a maintenance window)
 3) TMP storage was 96% full, this happens due to long uptime of appliance
 ​
 The last time I felt this way was when some of the rookies went over to replace a switch and turned off the AC in the server room because they had no hoodies, and forgot to turn them on. On Friday evening... 
 So, how often do you reboot your firewalls? :) And guess who the vendor is.

 I&#x27;ve been using 802.1x for SSTP VPN and EAP-TLS WiFi no issues. Using NPS server to do the auth and certs being issued by an AD PKI CA server..
 I&#x27;m trying to setup a Sophos Switch with EAP-TLS, or even EAP-MSCHAPv2 .. I setup my users computer to use either EAP-TLS or EAP-MSCHAPv2 (using either Device or User cert, with a corresponding NPS policy to match) , however when trying to auth against the switch, the NPS shows the logs:
 Network Policy Server denied access to a user.
 Contact the Network Policy Server administrator for more information.

My question is are the majority of these jobs require you to know command line like Cisco VoIP systems or a simplified GUI such as 3CX? Thank You for your help.

                              <span>Hi, I wanted to know if there is a device that can select between several transceivers and use only one signal at a time, like a channel selector kind of thing. I&#x27;m aware of CWDM multiplexors, but that is way more complex than what Im looking for. What Im seeking for is a way to connect several transceivers pairs and to send traffic between them, but selecting one pair at time. This &quot;adapter&quot; will be connected to one SFP+ port of a switch, so the idea is to test each transceiver pair without disconnecting it from that switches port.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

Can I host this using GlobalProtect, so that the users can download the rdp file and connect to it using ldap/ad credentials? So basically users will browse to the website hosted on PA, login and download rdp file to connect. Thanks in advance,

                              <span>Recently our two companies merged the majority of their processes and I knew the project of a network merge was on the horizon. 
 Thankfully the buildings are physically attached and we have some connections already shared. So just curious if you guys have any pointers on where to start. There is going to be a ton of information I need to capture. Sine I inherited one of the networks and am still learning all the subnets and Vlans. 
 If anyone has done this in the past themselves is there anything you wish you would have known off the jump? Do a little differently?
 Thanks a ton guys!

                              <span>Hi All - My company has two Cisco 7010’s strung together in the datacenter via HSRP and 20+ SVI’s between the two. Closet switches off of each 7010 switch. No endpoint is dual homed. Some closet switches go to one switch, others the 2nd switch. Only one 7010 has an upstream static route to the router and no routing exists between the switches. They want to insert a Palo Alto firewall between the two 7010’s in order to keep some outside traffic off the 2nd 7010. 
 I can’t get a second connection to the router. I cant re-ip the network. I cant get a routing protocol on the router. I cant have more than 4 hours downtime. I have to implement a PA between the two. 
 Any thoughts on a good way to do this? Besides just burn the whole network down and start over???
 Thanks

 Two questions 1. I have an offer to work as a contractor for 18 months. 290k. It is in LAX. No wfh. Would you take it? I have to quit current job. 
  
Thinking about getting a master degree in cloud or cybersecurity so that I can teach at community college for night classes and online classes. I can potentially generate 120k if I get to teach 12 units per each semester. Obviously not guaranteed that I will get an offer. Or would you go for CCIE for higher income?

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m looking for a nudge in the right direction. I have prepared a diagram which you can access here: https://imgur.com/a/3LTIPUe 
 I have several metering devices on several different locations. Each location has the same topology: 
  
one router with local IP 10.10.100.1 (LTE enabled)
 2 metering devices with local IPs 10.10.100.2 and 10.10.100.3 respectively.
  
I cannot change the local IPs (orange in the diagram) on any of these 3 devices, as they are already in use by other systems. Every other IP or setting on the routers or the pfsense cloud router is under my control and can be changed.
 Now, I have an OpenVpn server on a cloud pfsense VM, and everything is set-up and connected through the internet already and I can access every router on a different address on the 10.30.0.0…</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 Full disclosure, I’m not an IT person, I work in live events and had some weirdness going on today at a convention center and was curious if there was some guidance here. 
 Essentially I had two laptops wired into a dumb switch DHCP and they were golden. 
 I tried my personal Lenovo thinkpad wired into the same switch a bit later and was unable to get internet using dhcp. I checked and it kept auto connecting me to a gateway that was unused by the it department. Mind you, using wifi, internet worked fine on dhcp, but not wired. 
 They were pretty quick to shrug and say not my problem since the other laptops were working, but they were nice enough to designate me a static ip and the laptop is now working while wired.
 I’m just really trying to understand why this would happen, as I’ve used my laptop at plenty of venues and never experienced this. I reset the network from the status settings , I released and renewed dhcp from the command prompt, all to no avail. 
 I was trying to stop and start my dhcp certificate but was running into an error 5 code and unable to do it even though Im the primary user. 
 Curious if anyone has experienced this, and if there’s any guidance on how to deal with this in the future. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Good Evening gents,
 My business is currently looking at Forti client on the endpoint to connect remotely to the office. We are currently using Citrix cloud to connect remotely to a shared environment and Zscaler ZPA to connect to specific app that doesn&#x27;t fit Citrix Shared app. (mainly used for consultant and external.)
 As a Network admin, I&#x27;m not super keen about going with FortiClient and EMS, I&#x27;ve always had issue in the past concerning latency, crash, connection not establishing, etc... I also don&#x27;t find it to be super secure for our network. Note that I&#x27;m the only network admin ATM.
 Lastly, can one man really support a VPN for 300 end users?
 I&#x27;d like to know your experience &amp; your thought about using Forti SSL VPN / ZTNA.

                              <span>First time swapping out some 2960-X&#x27;s with 9200&#x27;s and when I was checking the ports prior to repatching neither a Fluke LinkRunner or netAlly AirCheck would detect PoE on a 9200 port. Both worked fine on a 9300.
 Plugging in a WAP and a phone worked okay so I could continue on but it&#x27;ll be a pita going forward if I can&#x27;t check/test PoE using the tools.
 Before I start in depth testing, has anyone come across this?
 I have a fancy new LinkRunner 10G coming so hopefully that&#x27;ll work.

                              <span>Does anyone have experience with 2+ mile wireless point-to-point solutions? I&#x27;ve done a few airFiber solutions under 2 miles and start to have issues making out possible obstructions with binoculars and my phones zoom feature. I also use the Ubiquiti UISP Design Center to get a ballpark figure on geographical obstructions. I was thinking of using a cheap telescope, but I don&#x27;t want to haul it up a ladder on top of a roof. Would something like a spotting scope work, or does anyone with experience in the have suggestions?

                              <span>Inherited a small branch site with an N1524 as their core. It&#x27;s connected to a couple other sites via IPSEC tunnel. Connectivity to all devices but the Dell switch from outside the branch office works fine, but I can&#x27;t even ping the thing unless I&#x27;m on that LAN.
 It doesn&#x27;t appear to be firewall related, and I&#x27;m wondering if there might be some ACL or other service on the Dell switch preventing access to it outside the LAN. 
 I have a login to the CLI but that&#x27;s about it. I tried thumbing through Dell&#x27;s documentation but didn&#x27;t find anything glaring when I tried printing the config.
 edit - I did note it was on an 8 year old firwmare version and updated it several releases. Still, no luck.

                              <span>Hi guys. My company has 2 ISPs that we use in an active/backup configuration. Each ISP has a single ethernet handoff that we connect into an external switch (switch for ISP 1 and another for ISP 2). Each ISP has 2 circuits.
 How common is this setup? If we were to have 1 circuit per ISP would this make things more difficult for us? Why don&#x27;t we have 2 handoffs per ISP? I guess this failover is handled by the ISP router? Quite a few questions here but I&#x27;m trying to demystify this!

 Today Wireshark asked to update and I agreed. My current version of Wireshark is 4.0.5, OS is Windows 10. After the update I lost ability to see packet data in packet details window.
 Here&#x27;s what it looks like now: https://i.ibb.co/ZgxfpRh/Screenshot-2023-05-15-204241.png
 How to return the ability to see the text, and not just the bytes in the lower right window?

                              <span>Hi everyone, looking for help from the community. Quick background, I am a system admin for our small business just a little under 100 employees, fully remote using VPN. Our current setup is using a Sophos Firewall SG230 and we will need a replacement before 2025 due to EOL support, so I am being proactive and looking at new equipment right now.
 I&#x27;m not sure what other information would be helpful in determining a replacement, but lets assume all things be equal? (generally) 
 I am in charge of finding a replacement, I am mainly a system admin, not networking admin so bare with my lack of needed knowledge. I know enough about using firewalls, but not when it comes to replacing it.
 Question:
 Anyone have any recommendations are similar firewalls to the Sophos SG230 that would be a good upgrade/replacement?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>For a few years this topic has been racing around in my head. A few years ago I made a start (Automate the Boring Stuff), but after a while I started using/learning less and less and most of it has just faded.
 In my daily job i&#x27;m a network engineer/architect. Are there any tips on learning and eventually mastering Python while working in the Networking branche? What i mean is: would you still recommend a course like Automate the Boring Stuff or maybe something else? Cause maybe I&#x27;m just too enthousiastic, but my goal is to add Python as an &quot;addon&quot; to my daily networking jobs.

                              <span>Can someone help me differentiate route vs policy VPN on Fortigates? All our VPNs have specific encryption domains, firewall policies referencing the tunnel interface and a route for the remote-side in the routing table. Is this considered policy or route? Is the only difference an encryption domain of 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 ?
 If my existing VPNs have specific encryption domains and I add a tunnel for 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 is that going to cause problems?

                              <span>I run IT at a small K12 school. One of my summer projects is to run fiber optic cable to an outbuilding. I did this last year to a different outbuilding and it worked great.
 Sad Story (optional)
 The one PITA part was fishing the FOC into the innerduct at the beginning. I got 1/2&quot; non-split LDPE, thinking that it would better protect the FOC than split tubing would. Well, that backfired because after I ran the cable ALL the way through the underground conduit and plugged it in, it didn&#x27;t work! I ordered a new cable, repeated the tedious process
 The Actual Question
 Should I use split or non-split innerduct? The split kind would be easier right? I could just sideload the cable all the way down, right?
 The cable will run through our attic (wood trusses and cinder block walls), down the exterior wall and in gray PVC in a trench across the yard to the outbuilding, and then up the wood stud wall into the nearest room.
 Currently planning to use this LDPE from eBay (with the ends taped together) if split is OK.
 Bonus: the cable is OS2 LC/LC UPC Plenum-rated (OFNP), as per local networking guy.
 Originally posted in r/FiberOptics last week, but I&#x27;m looking for more input. I&#x27;m particularly interested in the rationale behind your opinion.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have an integration of FreeRADIUS and LDAP running on IPA server. it works well but the FreeRADIUS config requires a user that can read LDAP and for this a password has to be stored in cleartext.
 Is there a way to achieve the Radius -&gt; LDAP authentication without storing a users&#x27; password in cleartext on the RADIUS server?

                              <span>So I am learning networking and have been interested in this setup of having:
 Transit BGP ---&gt; Switch ---&gt; Router
 This is a consideration due to a lack of router ports. It is my understanding that you can use a switch as an aggregation device sort of how a breakout cable would work. I&#x27;m concerned that this setup would impact BGP at the layer 4 but I am not sure?
 Are there any other disadvantages of my proposed topology? Would it be bad practice to also have downstream services via the same switch?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a gap in my knowledge that I would appreciate being filled regarding running out of ports. I noticed that routers such as the MX204 only have 4x100Gbe ports. I&#x27;m new to networking and don&#x27;t fully understand how this works but I&#x27;m fairly sure people use a switch to &#x27;extend&#x27; these ports.
 For example, a 100GB port could become 10x10Gb virtual interfaces. I realize that I may have gotten some terminology incorrect here but would appreciate any help with pinning down what this is called and how it works.
 Thanks for any help!
 Edit: And does this work only for downstream or can you also &#x27;extend&#x27; upstream ports?

 Just curious to know if anyone has any practical experience/comments on a Netscout 7120 PFS or similar “qualified” hardware. I’m hoping someone in the financials may be using this and is doing so with a relatively high rate of traffic.
 My concern is buffer space as a relates to microbursts. We currently use Arista 7150s which are slated for decommissioning in favor of the 7280 platform, and that old platform drops traffic like crazy, but for a new deployment the leadtime on the 7280 is way too long, so we’re looking at the Netscout side of things.
 Unfortunately, I don’t have a good indication of throughput requirements as yet, however, on paper, it’s possible it may fit the bill.
 Unfortunately, I’ve asked Netscout to put me in touch with existing clients to which they have not done so and have simply indicated that they have “received no complaints.”
 So, is anyone using this particular platform, and if so, have you seen any issues related to frame drops?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 ​
 I have a port-channel 1 as follows (cisco switch): 
 interface Port-channel1

 and I have the following 4 ports configured:

 switchport access vlan 560
 switchport mode access

 channel-group 1 mode active
 !
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/24

 Can anyone tell me why it&#x27;s not working? I last set the NAS&#x27;s NIC&#x27;s to: 
 EEE 802.3ad (Dynamic Link Aggregation): This mode requires a compatible network switch that supports Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) or EtherChannel. It provides load balancing and fault tolerance by distributing network traffic across the bonded interfaces. 
 ​
 I have an OPNSense which is doing the routing.. Not getting anything
 I do not want to reset the network settings..

                              <span>Hello, I am investigating Ruckus as for our future APs and switches, and wondering about Google SSO to access WIFI, which seems to be supported. This would help us blocking former staff and students from accessing our networks as soon as respective Google accounts are suspended.
 Random questions: 
  
Can users be assign to specific VLANs depending on a sort of ACLs or groups of users? 
 Could this work using only one SSID or would a secondary SSID be required for guests?
 How would you manage guests for a temporary access?
 
 Any experience on this matter?

                              <span>In a network I manage for a summer camp, we have a dozen or so remote locations around camp which are connected via BiDi fiber. At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, the only active equipment at these sites will be a single Wi-Fi access point. Currently at each location, the BiDi fiber is terminated in an SPF in an 8-port Cisco switch. The AP is then uplinked to and is powered by the switch. 
 These switches are well past their expected life and I will be replacing them before they start failing. 
 Since we don’t need all of the extra switch ports, I have been looking for a media converter that has an SFP cage as well as that can provide PoE out on its copper port (for the AP). These have been impossible to locate thus far.
 Does this device exist?
 I know I can get a low port count switch with PoE out and an SFP cage from Mikrotik and likely others, and I’ll likely go down that road if needed. I was hoping to avoid the extra configuration with those, though.
 Thanks for any pointers!

I am not saying he was unhealthy or had bad habits but it seems in our industry we worry more about our networks and users then we do about our own health.

Help desk looked at her client and said there&#x27;s no auto reply turned on and ran a repair on office before escalating to me. I looked over EAC and there are no forwards set up, no auto reply, no transport rules. Where could this be coming from?

 When we said no, he complains that &quot;everyone else always gives us domain admin rights so we can do anything we need to do&quot;. What planet is this guy from?

                              <span>For me it was voice communication via your workstation/laptop using something similar to Skype or Teams. Way back in the days, around 2005ish I saw a Microsoft partner demoing hosting conference calls and calling other people using a software very similar to Skype. I thought it looks interesting, but I just don&#x27;t see anyone using this in a corporate environment. Everyone has a Cisco phone at their desk.
 Well I was completely wrong.

 Why do I keep seeing people use Caps Lock to type in their passwords? I don&#x27;t know how many times I day I see it happening. These are usually the same people that end up locking themselves out of their account because they mistakenly left it on.
 I&#x27;m talking about:
  
Caps Lock on, type 1 letter, CL off, 1 letter, CL on, 1 letter, CL off, 4 letters, etc.
  
I see you using Shift all the time, do you think it doesn&#x27;t work on passwords?

                              <span>Title is really it. I have been running Proxmox for our corporate lab for about 2 years now and have loved it all around. There are some nuances of course, and it is very easy to break. Also stuck vm&#x27;s can be a pain to bring back online but that can be solved with good SOP&#x27;s and lack of fear of the linux CLI
 Has anyone had good results running production systems with this hypervisor? Any feedback on their paid support packages?
 I would love to have a 3rd option, getting really tired of Hyper-v issues and VMWare&#x27;s subscription balooning of costs...

 My IT Director is asking for ideas to better secure our infrastructure. An idea was to have system administrators work from jumpboxes, VMs, when needing to access AD, network configuration, etc, instead of accessing those resources directly from our work stations. Can anyone give recommendations on how to best implement this or give insight if you are currently doing something like this?

                              <span>Hi,
 I released version 1.5.1 of mxcheck. mxcheck is a little helper that checks e-mail servers for correct DNS entries, certificates, information leaks and if the e-mail server is an open relay. It is a command line tool and open source.
 Happy if it helps you.
 https://github.com/steffenfritz/mxcheck
 As always, if you find a bug or have a feature idea, let me know.
 p.s.: I posted for older version here before, so please don&#x27;t ask for docker, web user interface or why you should use this and not another solution. I create this in my sparetime to get my work done and I am happily sharing it. If you use something different, it is absolutely ok. &lt;3

 We have a problem I hope maybe someone here has some knowledge or help us. We want to use some smartcard to authenticate on machines.We&#x27;ve bought already 4 different Smart Card Reader / Writer. We also already bought 2 different Cards. But still doesn&#x27;t work under Linux/Mac/Win. Under linux I get using pcsc_scan that card is unresponsive.
 When I try the following command with a Bank card opensc-tool -r0 -a 3b:ff:13:00:... with the cards we bought I get nothing the reply is empty.
 Before even jumping to the authentication part I would like to write them. I need help with this and maybe the cards I bought are bad ? 
 What we bought : - Cards with Yaron Gtech SLE4428 with HiCo Magnetic Stripe PVC - Cards with SLE4442 - Reader ACS ACR39U-UF - Reader Techly CAM-USB2TY Compact/Writer - Reader USB Smart Card Reader, Rocketek DOD Military USB - Reader Thales 
 Thanks a lot for any help Best

                              <span>Hi all
 Recently one of our &quot;VIP&quot; users had the problem that his desktop icons get moved around when he changes workplace (WOH or Laptop). Maybe an important to note, is that he has 3 displays and connects to a VM through a software client on his worklaptop (connected via dockingstation).
 I saw if you disable all the &quot;move automatically&quot; and grid settings, then it shouldn&#x27;t move everything around or &quot;memorize&quot; where what was, even when switching between mono or multi displays setups.
 I tested it on my setup and it didn&#x27;t seem so consistent with &quot;memorizing&quot; where I set the icons. Has anyone had any similar experience or what do you guys use? If anything.
 P.S: Yes, it is very important on which screen what icon is placed...

                              <span>We have Cisco Meraki access points, an NPS RADIUS server currently running on Windows Server 2012 R2, and a Sophos XGS 5500 firewall. We have separate SSIDs for BYOD devices and corporate owned devices, and the BYOD devices are on a completely different subnet and different VLAN.
 The Meraki system is configured for WPA2-Enterprise 802.1X connections using the user&#x27;s AD username and password to authenticate with the NPS RADIUS server. It&#x27;s also set up to forward RADIUS accounting packets to NPS which is then configured to forward them on to the firewall, so the firewall can associate BYOD IPs with users and apply rules and policies accordingly. 802.11r and 802.11w are both turned off. Mandatory DHCP is turned off. RADIUS server timeout and EAP timeout are both set to 10 seconds. It&#x27;s confi…</span>

                              <span>I am seeing some event 35 on our DC (Windows Server 2016, last update installed is the April Patch Tuesday). My problem is with the &quot;another KDC&quot; in the details :
 &quot;The Key Distribution Center (KDC) encountered aticket-granting-ticket (TGT) from another KDC (login.microsoftonline.com) that did not contain aPAC attributes field. &quot;
 We are in a hybrid environment so I think this is linked but I can&#x27;t find how to fix that.
 Anyone have info ?

                              <span>I was wondering how others handle sharing with anyone in org settings. I noticed some documents need to be shared that way, but I have found a several that students can see and should not have any access to them too. (I fear there may be a lot) I imagine that is fine if everyone in org is an employee. But since we are a university, we have students in our same org. Are other schools just using different email addresses for students?
 thanks!

 I found a great comment by u/LudwikTR
  
I feel like most people in the comments are not understanding the mechanism that makes this potentially problematic. I will admit that the author of the website, focusing primarily on his disdain for a particular corporation, doesn&#x27;t help clarify the point.
 A significant amount of software automatically converts parts of text that appear to be URLs (even without an explicit protocol) into clickable links. These include mail clients, messengers, internet forums, social media sites, CMS systems, text editors, etc.
 Until now, such software would convert hello.com into a clickable link (since .com is a valid TLD) but would leave hello.zip as is (since .zip wasn&#x27;t one).…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I have an integration of FreeRADIUS and LDAP running on IPA server. it works well but the FreeRADIUS config requires a user that can read LDAP and for this a password has to be stored in cleartext. 
 Is there a way to achieve the Radius -&gt; LDAP authentication without storing a users&#x27; password in cleartext on the RADIUS server?

                              <span>Lets say i have a virtual Fileserver. The Data of the Fileserver is on a iscsi storage (LUN/Datastore). This should be Block storage ?
 Now many other vms Connect to the Fileserver to get Access to the Data. That should be File Storage, right?
 Is that correct? Thanks for Help.

 What kind of remote access solution should i use? I think something along the lines of VPN, and most likely something Cisco (we are running as much Cisco as possible)? And are there other things i should think about- maybe a firewall?

 &quot;oh where that screen went that I borrowed, no idea I changed sites few weeks ago and didn&#x27;t take it with me&quot; 
 And this goes for screens, 4G-Modems, printers, TV&#x27;s..
 Almost anything they can borrow they lose. 
 We saw a GPS-tracker solution but that was the size of a brick ánd expensive for an asset worth €150 
 In an ideal world, i&#x27;d be looking for a bluetooth low energy tag, that we can put software on our windows clients to scan for (or they can send us their location ofcourse).
 https://www.wiliot.com/ looks interesting but isn&#x27;t in production yet. 
 Spent some time googling but can&#x27;t find a solid solution so looking for any input!

                              <span>Odd technology bingo question. Using a DFS share to present user profile and Office ODFC volumes to our VDI users using FSLogix. Mostly working fine and dandy, but seeing issues occasionally post and during VHD mount that appear to relate to VSS writers timing out.
 Basically around the time we&#x27;ve had reported issues, i can see errors in the DFS server logs relating to VSS. In application logs:
 EventID 12298 (VSS)
 Volume Shadow Copy Service error: The I/O writes cannot be held during the shadow copy creation period on volume \\?\Volume{fed84df2-6fdf-466b-9ce9-9e3671b67ba8}\. The volume index in the shadow copy set is 0. Error details: Open[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ], Flush[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ], Release[0x80042314, The shadow copy provider timed out while holding writes to the volume being shadow copied. This is probably due to excessive activity on the volume by an application or a system service. Try again later when activity on the volume is reduced.
 ], OnRun[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ].
 Operation:
 Executing Asynchronous Operation
 Context:
 Current State: DoSnapshotSet
 ​
 System Logs:
 event id 8 (Volsnap)
 The flush and hold writes operation on volume X: timed out while waiting for a release writes command.
 I don&#x27;t have VSS enabled on the volume, no backup application running at the time etc. I&#x27;m assuming DFS doesn&#x27;t rely on the VSS service to perform it&#x27;s replication to other member servers?, if so can i disable the service on the basis no shadows configured on the volume and no backup apps rely on the service?

                              <span>Today, all CIS Benchmarks have at least 2 profiles defined as follows:
 Level 1 - Items in this profile intend to:
  
Be practical and prudent
 Provide a clear security benefit
 Not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means
  
Level 2 - This profile extends the &quot;Level 1&quot; profile. Items in this profile exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:
  
Are intended for environments or use cases where security is paramount
 Acts as defense in depth measure
 May negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology
  
The questions are:
  
What Level do you typically use?
 Do you use the above criteria to determine which Level to use?
 Do you have a different criteria, if so what is it?
  
All feedback will be greatly appreciated.
 CIS is a community-driven nonprofit responsible for industry leading best practices for securing IT systems and data. The CIS Benchmarks are computer system configuration guidance standards that are used world-wide to secure systems ranging from handheld devices to workstations to servers to network devices.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bit of a long term employee - 15 years in the current Senior Sysadmin role in education in East coast Australia. Today two L1s and I got the email offering to have the redundancy discussion. A bit strange since we are the only non-MSP staff and the key source of site knowledge. I&#x27;m approaching 50 and the main household earner and there is some well founded trepidation... but strangely after the hard years of Covid lockdowns and short staffing I find myself thinking that this is is an opportunity and not a curse. Any tips for those who have been in this position are welcome.

 ​
 I have a little problem regarding SMTP on a windows server 2012 r2. Running in IIS 6.0.
 Current sessions are very long meaning that for exemple scan-to-mail takes a long time. Ill see about 150 seconds before session is ended and the mail has been sent.
 Feels like an quit command cant be recived from printer or from smtp server.
 Our firewall was also updated regard firmware.
 If i terminate an session in smtp, the mail is sent right away.
 An manual quit command kind of.
 ​
 Any idé what it could be?
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey folks, We’re doing some tests with OCFS2 for creating an active passive setup across two regions.
 In the current setup, we have two DCs, dc01 and dc02. VMs vm01 and vm02 share an ocfs2 fs. The shared virtual disk resides on a dedicated lun that is replicated to the remote site. vm03 and vm04 are in dc02 with ocfs2 setup with the same cluster name. For failover the vms in dc01 are shutdown, the lun is switched to rw mode in dc02, virtual disks are mounted in vm03/04 and then ocfs2 is mounted. This is working as expected but involves tasks at the san level.
 I was reading about drdb and was wondering if we can use it to replicate the ocfs2 in dc01 over wan to dc02. In this approach we’ll just use independent virtual disks and not use the san based replication.
 But is this even possible? Should we setup drdb between vm01 and vm03 or is my understanding not correct?

 I have renewed an Let&#x27;s Encrypt SSL certificate (fullchain.pem and privkey.pem) that I want to deploy to the tomcat web server.
 I am looking at the server.xml file, but I am not 100% sure how to proceed.
 I see different SSL &quot;connectors&quot; like NIO and APR/native. I don&#x27;t know the difference. Which one should I use and why?
 The config points to three files: certificateKeyFile, certificateFile and certificateChainFile.
 ​
 Is the below approach correctly understood?
 ​
 certificateKeyFile is the privkey.pem file
 certificateChainFile is the fullchain.pem file
 But what should I put in certificateFile?

                              <span>We have an automated workflow by which AD accounts that have no successful logins in the past x days get disabled. 
 The problem is that our service desk receives many calls a day for the thousands of very occasional, infrequent users whose accounts get disabled but then need access again. These are users who work at manufacturing sites and who have minimal computer use.
 How do you guys reduce the attack surface while reducing the impact to user experience and your IT service desk?

                              <span>Hi guys. I have a situation where a couple of 365 accounts need to login in a virtual machine but the actual persons can&#x27;t see/access the desktop. Before number matching, they could approve the request on their phones without any issue, but now they obviously need to enter the number to confirm. How can this be solved? By setting a different auth method for those accounts only? Or... ?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 after reading the SMTP-RFC I&#x27;m unsure how an (the average?) SMTP server will act when a first delivery to another mail server fails:
 Let&#x27;s say example.com has one MX record mail.example.com. mail.example.com is unreachable and a remote SMTP delivery fails because of it.
 Before the remote SMTP server tries another delivery, the A record mail.example.com is updated to point to a failover server. Will remote SMTP servers re-resolve the hostname mail.example.com on the second delivery attempt or will they use the IP address they received the first failure from?
 I could test this, but I would be interested in real-life experience as I&#x27;m sure different mail server software will behave differently if this is not RFC-mandated.

 Long time lurker, first time poster.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve recently been tasked with creating/implementing a ticketing system (I&#x27;m a new Apprentice IT Technician) for our Team of 2 (within the Education Industry) and would love to know what ticketing system everyone uses. I know that it&#x27;s possible to use google forms and export this to a google sheet/excel document. But ideally I&#x27;d love something that I can make reports on and export into csv files. 
 We have roughly 1000 users so being able to select a priority and categorising the calls would be an amazing feature. Ideally I&#x27;d love for a free solution but honestly please drop any/all suggestions and I will see what is cost effective for us.

 I can&#x27;t seem to find a straight answer for deploying Windows 11 however. I can install my applications fine, but struggle to capture the image using MDT. I have read that a lot of people experience issues with MDT. I am thinking - there&#x27;s got to be a straightforward way of doing this that I am missing when reading Microsoft docs, etc.
 What is the standard method for deploying Windows 11 Azure joined machines? Or what is your preferred method? Any help is massively appreciated.

 Today, I had to use the break glass account and when I logged in, I was promted to go through the MFA setup (microsoft authenticaor app). I did this and gained access to the account but now I&#x27;m stuck with MFA on the account.
 I&#x27;ve check all my CA policies and the account is excluded from them, I haven&#x27;t changed any settings in the admin panel for months so I can&#x27;t see why the account would suddenly be required to have MFA set up.
 Any ideas where I can look? other places where this type of thing is set?

                              <span>We are looking to &#x27;propperly&#x27; buildout our PKI, and we&#x27;re looking for documentation to use as a Design basis. Of course we have the &#x27;AD CS bible&#x27; (Windows Server 2008 PKI and Cert Security), and are familiar with the common practices (offline roots, HSMs etc). 
 The problem for us is... how far should we go if we don&#x27;t have external requirements?
 We aren&#x27;t trying to get trusted by the CA/Browser forum, as far as I know there are no industry cert &#x27;bridges&#x27; we are intersted in, we don&#x27;t fall under PCI or HIPPA or any specific compliance standard. Theres ISO 27099 as a general aplicabaility standard but its not very prescriptive of the implementaiton, only the &#x27;paperwork&#x27; assocaited with it. 
 When proposing options (i.e windows cert store vs yubi HSM, vs Thales HSMs) with tens of thousands of dollars difference, for an area of our infra not well understood by the non technical folks, what justification can I give other than &quot;more money more betterer&quot; to guide the discussions.

                              <span>Hello Caffeine Addicts,
 I´ve come to ask for help. I am working on setting up FOG Project (client imaging system).
 I am an apprentice and got this as a project. I have setup a new VM with Debian that runs FOG and I have provided fog with the dhcp servers ip address. DHCP works and the client can pull the filename, size and ip address. However, it shuts off shortly after the ipxe screen with error message &quot;DHCP error&quot;. I´ve attached a screenshot and I´ve read countless websites and community posts.

                              <span>Not sure how many Nutanix admins we have here, but in my environment we applied the DBX files as mentioned in ADV200011 and Microsoft guidance for applying Secure Boot DBX update (KB4575994).
 Every month after applying Windows Updates all the servers which have had the DBX files applied suddenly become vulnerable to BootHole again and Nessus starts flagging them with:
 The Windows Secure Boot forbidden signature database (DBX) did not contain the expected certificates. When performing DBX updates exactly as illustrated in the vendor documentation, it is important to note that you are applying only the latest update. Updates applied in this manner may only appended to the DB, so you may still need to apply the older updates from the &quot;Archive of Prior Versions of DBX Files&quot; linked in the UEFI Revocation List File document (linked in the See Also advisory). Please refer to the vendor advisory for more information. 
 Nutanix supposedly fixed the issue in a update to Foundation (4.5.4.2 - Nutanix Account may be required)
 For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been pushing this out to all the Virtuals on the Nutanix cluster from PDQ (which only temporarily fixes):
 Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\apr2021\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\apr2021\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\aug2022\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\aug2022\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\sep2022\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\sep2022\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite 
 I&#x27;ve logged two calls with Nutanix, and the outcome is because its a Windows VM it can&#x27;t be a Nutanix issue so contact Microsoft.
 Other than contacting Microsoft, does anyone know how we could resolve this?

                              <span>Hello,
 My organization is looking for a cost-effective MDM solution that is suitable for our environment and our requirements. The primary objectives are to manage BYOD (mainly mobile devices with Andoird, iOS operating systems) and a few corporate mobile devices if applicable, such as controlling the number of mobile devices per user, secure access (requiring devices to be password-protected, data to be wiped in case of theft or compromise). 
 Currently, we do not use Microsoft Office but Google Workspace (G-Suite) with Enterprise Starter license. As with this license, we can enable basic features of mobile device management, like enabling passcode, wiping data. On the other hand, we wish to limit the number of authorized/registered mobile devices (BYOD), and also want to improve some optional features, such as blocking insecure devices (jailbreak or rooted devices, unsupported/legacy devices), requiring anti-malware protection, requiring device encryption, automatically removing devices that haven&#x27;t check in for 30 days.
 We have narrowed down the list of vendors to Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management), ScaleFusion, Miradore. Some of the solution providers that are ruled out include Microsoft Intune (I love it but we are using Google Workspace), JumpCloud (Anroid devices not supported), SimpleMDM &amp; Mosyle (only iOS devices supported). I personally prefer Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management) given the fact that our ecosystem is based on it (we will not have to invest more time or resources to another solution) and our security requirements are just fundamental.
 Given that, can you share your feedback or experience in this matter? Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi. 
 How do I block certain websites on an individual machine but on all browsers installed on that machine? I tried router settings but they never seem to work. 
 Some employees waste a lot of time ever since I repaired their laptops and took away their new machines for further allotment in other departments at my organisation.
 Edit: Is there a way within Windows itself? Don&#x27;t really want to go for paid solutions as of now.. 
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am trying to allow standard users to run ViPlex Express (LED signage software) on our RDS server.
 Everytime ViPlex Express is launched the user is prompted for UAC as the software is from an unknown publisher.
 So far I have tried granting &quot;everyone&quot; FULL access to the bin directory in the install directory.
 I have tried creating a scheduled task icon which only works for myself.
 I have tried running Standard User Analyzer which doesn&#x27;t detect any issues.
 I have tried running Application Compatibility Toolkit and making a shim but that doesn&#x27;t work.
 I have reached out to the developer to see if they have a signed copy of ViPlex Express but I will not be holding my breath on getting a positive outcome from that enquiry.
 I would rather not disable UAC or make the user and admin but I do need some way for them to run this software. How do others run unsigned software for standard users?

I’m looking for real sysadmin experience on this and if anybody would like to give insight on things I should add/drop? Thank you all I really appreciate it!

                              <span>I understand that IGMPv3 allow two servers to use the dance multicast address to send data to subscribers/receivers. I understand this is accomplished by allowing the receiver to specify a physical source address when requesting to join a multicast group. My question is why would someone design a topology that way. Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to just use a different multicast address for different data. 
 I read that it could lead to reduced bandwidth by using a single multicast to send different data. I can&#x27;t visualize how the bandwidth demand would be any different.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been preparing for the Cisco ENCOR exam lately and I&#x27;ve noticed something quite surprising. The exam includes quite a bit of content on tools like the DNA Center, Firepower features, WSA, and ESA.
 While these are undoubtedly advanced and powerful tools, it seems to me that they&#x27;re not widely used in a lot of real-world enterprise networks. Many companies, especially smaller ones, don&#x27;t use these specific tools in their daily operations.
 So, I&#x27;m wondering, shouldn&#x27;t the ENCOR exam focus more on technologies and skills that are more universally applicable in today&#x27;s networking world?

 If using a layer 3 switch and the switchports connected to the end hosts are layer 3, will ARP messages update the cam table or the ARP table or both? I know its both if using SVIs for routing, unsure about this one.

                              <span>Not sure if this is a question for this sub, but ill give it a try nonetheless.
 so I have a network at my office where the nas has our file, and everyone through the nas can access the file and log on and make amends and whatnot. recently im looking to get another office opened in another country and I want to make it possible for people in other countries to access my local (main) network so they can also open that file from the nas and make amends.
 if the file was on the other location this would cause a problem as there will now be 2 files and then if someone for remote cant sees the local changes and vice versa.
 with some research, I&#x27;ve seen that maybe a Site-to-Site Vpn would work for this and would allow my remote devices to act as if they are on the local network. I&#x27;ve seen a firewall box called the merwaki go GX50 which apparently has the Site to site VPN function, so im here to ask would this work and is there any other solutions that i can deploy or better suited for this use case.

                              <span>My knowledge of this is very partial, I hope this is the right place to ask.
 Some months ago I started paying an extra to my ISP in order to have a static IP, which I think it entails not being behind a Carrier-grade NAT.
 I see that my router is choosing 100.64.0.83 and 100.64.0.84 as DNS servers. Under my understanding, DNS servers are &quot;external/public machines&quot;, for instance 8.8.8.8 belongs to Google. But looking up 100.64.0.83, it seems like it&#x27;s a &quot;shared address space&quot;, which seems to be like the 192.168.0.xx, part of a private network. But I don&#x27;t t hink it&#x27;s not part of my private network (the ping is higher). Am I actually behind a CGN or am I misunderstanding something?

                              <span>I will have the following:
  
1 Windows Server 2019 PC where GPMC is controlled [DC] (192.168.4.10)
 1 Windows 11 PC to access the PC above to modify GPMC (192.168.4.99)
 10 PC Clients (192.168.4.150 [-159])
 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
 Default Gateway: 192.168.4.2
 Primary DNS: 192.168.4.10
  
The idea is for the clients to access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 station, as I plan on doing some sort of filtering. That is, if a client attempts to access a blocked site, they will see a site unavailable page that I will re-direct them to.
 I was thinking to have them access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 PC, but I&#x27;ve also been told that I should set up another server strictly for RRAS, which I&#x27;m very new to, as well.
 I also want to install software from GPMC. For that, I will need a shared folder somewhere on my network that my clients can access, without allowing access to my network settings or GPMC.
 My question: Please show me a network drawing of how I should go about this setup. There will be two users in my active directory: MyAdmin and MyUser. All 10 clients will connect using MyUser. The PC used to access GPMC will use MyAdmin.
 What (if any) PCs should I add to this network and what function would they serve? If I add more PCs, who handles acting like a router? File Server (for installations)? As I&#x27;m trying to do that all on the DC but I hear that&#x27;s not good practice.

 I’ve posted a while to find something for reporting etc and I think I’ve landed on NTOP as they seem to have solved the VPN issue I would be bound to experience with Zabbix.
 Scenario: We have a few installations with jump boxes installed for our audio visual installations that we managed across Australia.
 Wanting to find something simple that wasn’t subscription based that I could host at the office to get all that data back.
 I haven’t done a demo yet but wondering if anything had any NTOP experience and if so, anything missing, anything you don’t like?

                              <span>We&#x27;re serving an L2TP VPN for our users. Some experience timeouts of some requests to an internal webserver. This scenario is
  
user is on a home internet connection
 
vpn is established
 
packets to the webserver are routed through the vpn
 
dns resolution through vpn works
 
login page of the webserver may load or timeout depending on luck
 
using another internet connection solves the issue
 
 I&#x27;m guessing there is something special about l2tp I don&#x27;t understand, that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m posting here. It looks like the some home routers are messing with some encrypted packets. How? I haven&#x27;t seen behaviour like this ever before.

                              <span>Hi guys.
 I&#x27;m looking for a management systems for domain registrars. (Paid or open source) I&#x27;m talking about web applications that can manage the registration/transfer of domain names and that lets a user handle DNS records for a domain name. I would like too that this web applications has the possibility of sending/exporting cost reports for each user.
 Thanks in advance

 I&#x27;m new around these parts only just landing my first jr admin role very recently.
 Would anyone have any recommendations on what resources to use to learn how vulnerabilities and security works?
 I&#x27;m looking for basics right up to advanced as i&#x27;d like to learning everything as i go

                              <span>Hello,
 running Debian bookworm and a Windows Server 2022 PDC. Be careful, it will be a lengthy post.
 The Windows PDC&#x27;s DNS is configured to only accept secure updates.
 So Debian is domain-joined by using realmd. SSSD is installed with all dependecies &#x27;realm discover&#x27; lists (including sssd-ad) in version 2.8.2.
 realm join -v EXAMPLE.COM 
 I provide the neccessary credentials and realm authenticates against the domain controller from EXAMPLE.COM .
 &#x27;klist&#x27; lists correctly the cached krb5 ticket from the account which was used to join. The PDC acts also as DNS Server if I look after &quot;debian.example.com&quot;, all &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;AAAA&#x27; entries are added.
 The default sssd.conf looks like this:
 [sssd] domains &#x3D; Example.com config_file_version &#x3D; 2 services &#x3D; nss, pam services &#x3D; nss, pam ad_hostname &#x3D; d…</span>

                              <span>Hey Everyone. I apologize for the long post. when writing posts i have the habit of trying to give as much context as possible to the point of going overboard.
 I have many years experience as a tech doing breakfix as an authorized service provider on all sorts of computers including every vender I can think of for their desktops, laptops, workstations, and tower servers. I did that for 7 years in a small but super busy computer repair shop where i learned fundamentals of working with customers but more important to the topic of this thread, I learned how to fix and build almost every type and style and size of desktop with the exception of rackmounted servers. I never did outcall service calls at that job (it was someone elses job to go onsite where it was my job to man the shop)
 I quit …</span>

 Do they do the same or they different tasks? 
 Can you have users/devices managed by both or is intune more of for devices on the go?
 Example, deploying defender for end point is it better do via Intune and skip using GPOs altogether?

                              <span>I need to set this up for the first time. Can anyone advise on what are my options and/or what is the best way to proceed?
 I work for a small company so it will only be for a few desktops to begin with. I have local resources that users will need access to. So as I see it right now I have two choices.....
  
 I can provision the VDI on my network, but where is the best place to put it? Do I need an isolated server etc. for security?
 I would preferably like to use Azure but I am not sure if I can or how well it will work with my local resources.

 Also, any recommended study materials for a particular one?
 I would consider Red Hat too, but is literally too expensive and out of the equation.
 Plus, I would like to gain a good understanding of Linux system, not deep dive into it and be an expert at it.

 [].com uses an unsupported protocol.
 ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
 Unsupported protocol

 I have tried other devices and other browsers with the same issue. And it&#x27;s just my website. So this isn&#x27;t a internet or chrome or web browser issue I don&#x27;t think.
 I&#x27;m guessing something went wrong with my website. Maybe I got hacked? I got a really weird email saying &quot;42 - ( ) &quot; that said it was sent from myself via my website, around the time my website went down.
 How can I fix this when I can&#x27;t even access the control panel of my website? (since I need to go to my website to access the Wordpress dashboard)

                              <span>I just started working it for this company 3 weeks ago and we’ve got some problems way over my head. The boss man new this going in but I’m in school and he’s helping me OJT this stuff. 
 Our current conundrum is twofold. I need to build a server that can house a MySQL server VM database that any one or two or three of 10 people can access at any given time, as well as run a file sharing VM to access a few network mapped drives. I’ve been looking servers with 2x xenon e5-2699 v3s, would that be enough processing power? 128gb ram and probably 8x 1tb SSDs. 
 More importantly at the moment, we just tried switching ISPs for gigabit speeds and learned the hard way that comcast blocks port 445 and will not unblock it no matter what. And we use 445 for our current Azure file shares SMB network mapped drives. Is there a good work around for the mean time while I get this new server built? Our MSP wants $4k to build an Azure VPN to tunnel the file shares but that’s a little absurd. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all, Im trying to use the Remote desktop software to login into a second user account Ive created on my home pc. 
 Basically, I just want another instance of windows to multi-box something, but other software as VMware and Virtualbox dont work. I know other people that use RDP for the reason I want to use it for too, so thats why Im deciding to use it, however none of them ran into the problem im having.
 Ive created 2 seperate Admin accounts on my PC, one with just a Name / pw, and the other with my microsoft email.
 I am using &quot;127.0.0.2&quot; to try and log into the either of the second users, and using the microsoft account one does not work for some reason, it says credentials are wrong. However I can use the other user that i named &quot;Test&quot; with a password i set.
 However upon loggin into that account, I am greeted by the error stated in the title. I have googled the issue and there are a ton of people also having similar problem, will some suggestions saying to add registry keys, or change some setttings in windows to change the limit of connections. I have done all of these but they have not worked.

 I&#x27;ve been struggling with this issue for a few hours and after hours of searching for solution I decided to ask for help here (I very rarely go ask to a forum). It appears that uwsgi cannot bind to /run/uwsgi due to it being a read-only filesystem. When I try to set the location elsewhere it results in the same thing. Does anyone know what to do with this?

                              <span>Hi, as in the title.
 I read that many hate rhel, other hate Ubuntu and Canonical, other that hate what happened to centos..and many other. Many of this probably came from casual users or not techical user. 
 What think sysadmin about this 2 distros?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Title says it all. Our leadership is considering pulling the plug on MECM and moving us to BigFix. 
 Any insider tips? Opinions? Technically they seem comparable. Going through the demo process now. Anything to watch out for?
 We mainly use MECM currently to issue patching, WinOS upgrades, and app deployments; our Macs currently on JAMF, and our Linux are unmanaged. 
 Our scope on BF would be all our 15,000 servers/workstations/laptops covering all OS types Win/MacOS/Linux. At this time MDM would not be included and our Android/iOS will be staying on MobileIron core at this time.

 Junior support engineer here.
 Part of my goals for the year are writing end user instructions for the business.
 This can range from devs to your usual corporate roles (HR, fiance etc) 
 Do you have any suggestions on what I should write about apart from the obvious.
 Any and all suggestions welcome.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am posting this question to the community as I am looking for some suggestions, helpful guides which can help me implementing the design to achieve the below scenario:
 Scenario: We have to automate the application onboarding for OIDC/SAML app. hosted in secure auth to ForgeRock.
 Design: Similar to any IAC tool where we declare the desired state using a yaml file, the same conecpt is said to be utilized. We would have a yaml file defining application details. Going through terraform registry, I found that there is no such provider defined for oidc/saml app onboarding by ForgeRock. Also, if we define a plugin for same we are restricted by the programming language (need to use Go for development). So, we need a kind of python script which can function similar to a provider in Terraform, reading through the desired application configuration from the yaml file and then making use of the rest api endpoint exposed by ForgeRock for creating the app.
 Can anyone in the community please help me out here with any useful resources like any Github repo&#x27;s ,opensource project, docs which I can make use of to give me a starting point about how this can be implemented?

                              <span>Hi everybody, 
 Last week my company decided they want to set up three TVs in the production facility which only purpose will be to show on all screens the same web page. This TVs have Android and Chromecast built-in and will be connected over Wifi. I have already set up an hidden SSID with a separate VLAN with only guest access (they can&#x27;t reach any service or server aside from the ones I decide to). I have also set up a Windows 10 VM to try casting via Google Chrome and it works fine. The issue is that this setup takes a lot of resources from the VM and sometimes the image on the TVs gets &quot;blurry&quot; when it&#x27;s still for a few mins. The question is: is there a better way to do what I&#x27;m doing? I can&#x27;t find any viable desktop software that lets me cast to multiple devices. 
 Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t use any additional wiring because the distances will be too high. The only thing we could improve would be to connect the TVs via Ethernet. 
 Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions!

 Any ideas??? (btw, the ports that do work have entire internet connectivity and it&#x27;s 1ghps and working fine, so I don&#x27;t see how it could be a nat issue.)

 Would some authenticator apps have logs on their phone to look at? 
 For example:
 Microsoft authenticator just left a notification to on the phone to “approve sign in” and 1 hour later when user clicked the notice it just glitches out with a time out error message
 So no way to know which account triggered it?
 What steps would you do if it happened? And what are some logical possibility, (ie, the mail app on iPhone trying to login with cached credentials.) to tell the user so they don’t like freak out.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I have a technical interview for a Sr. Linux Systems Administrators on Wednesday. I’ve heard that other failed candidates have been too ‘junior’.
 What in particular would you expect to come up on a Sr. Linux Admin technical interview?
 I think I’m at a senior level, but this has me nervous 😋
 Things I’m comfortable with:
  
Storage - Local and SAN. Various file systems. LVM. Monitoring disk space and disk performance/health 
 Upgrading systems and rolling back packages/kernels 
 Backups with various tools such as Veeam
 Compiling software with GCC/Make
 GIT
 NFS/Samba
 Monitoring tools such as Nagios/SolarWinds
 Networking/load balancing/firewalls/bonding 
 Active Directory/LDAP
 Bash/Python scripting 
 Ansible/Terraform
 Printing/cups
  
What am I missing that a senior should know how to do? 🙂
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙂

                              <span>Our firm uses VDI so that we access our workspace anywhere. The issue I&#x27;m faced with is that for some strange reason, I cannot hear any sound from within the VDI environment through my regular sound output; they only way I can listen to sound within the VDI is if I switch my sound to my monitor&#x27;s native speakers or plug in my headphones.
 I&#x27;ve searched all over the web for a solution and pretty much get the same note about installing a driver update, but after checking I have the latest.
 I&#x27;m running Windows 10 x64.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Running Windows system check.
 Running Windows sound check/fix
 Disabling the native speaker option/driver
 Rebooting the computer.
 Checking to make sure I have the lastest updates.
 Cursing at my tower.
 Going outside to get a burger then coming home and trying steps 1-6
  
Nothing seems to change; advice would be apreciated.

                              <span>I’ve tried updating the firmware. Changing various firmware settings. Different drives, different hard drive bays, different SSDs, windows 11, windows server 2022. No matter what I do if any drive other than the ssd is connected when the machine is booted - booting from the ssd won’t even be an available option for me. Automatically off the list. I will always end up in the EFI shell. 
 So at this point I’m only connecting the SSD and booting to windows server 2022 and running random-ish firmware and driver updates from the intel site. Their site/tool is recognizing the individual hardware but throwing some error about some thing like my hardware configuration - idk I’m away from the house right now but I imagine it’s because of my Frankenstein setup so it’s not able to recommend drivers and updates for me I’m kinda guessing and checking. 
 I’m not sure my professor is even supposed to be used with this board the, Xeon 1650 V4 @ 3.6 GHz; but they were being used together in a product I got this from. 
 I have 128 GB RAM and a second processor on the way just cause. The setup should theoretically work as it is though they were running Linux. 
 I wanted to get started with something I was familiar with (windows) but I suppose I can try a Linux distro in parallel if there are suggestions. Would really love to solve this tho for windows. Want a GUI on either.
 Thanks !

 I&#x27;ve dabbled in Hyper-V a bit and there is definitely a learning learning curve. At least for me. 
 I have not touched VMware.

                              <span>Title says it all. We actually will retain a low-end firewall for some basic security and to manage redundant ISP uplinks. 
 We went serverless. It wasn&#x27;t even planned. Between going O365 and several other business critical apps migrating SaaS, when we looked to renew our on-prem server stack, it was real easy to just eliminate or migrate the remaining to PaaS/SaaS. 
 Part of that was moving to Azure AD and Intune/Defender, and then the more we looked at it, and with half our work force remote anyway, we felt we no longer needed on prem network security or a firewall. Just need internet. I feel we are more secure than before and it&#x27;s easier to manage and keep up with.
 Costs and workloads are relative yet shifted. I don&#x27;t even know if I am quite a sysadmin anymore. I have always had multiple roles, but not really a network admin for sure. But I keep busy. It has been stressful here in the middle of my career doing a complete upgrade in knowledge, and it was a crapton of work.

                              <span>Very soon, I will be meeting with HR and my director to present the subjects we should be covering under our Cyber policies.
 This includes things like:
  
 Email
  Internet Usage
  File Sharing
  USB access
  
However, I feel kind of lost, and unsure of how i’m supposed to cover EVERY topic, to not leave out anything etc. 
 I’m also unsure of the wording, does HR take care of that, and IT simply presents the subjects, and what we need legally covered?
 I have low expectations for someone writing the policy for us, and fully expect to be charged with doing this task.
 How did you come up with your operating policies?

 Anyone have any vendor recommendations ? So far we’ve looked at Drata, Vanta and Trustcloud (the later I wasn’t impressed with, first call could of been answered with an email, a second meeting for a demo and a required 3rd meeting to even get pricing is where I told them no thanks)
 Also who do you recommend for pen testing? We are a SaaS company that provides a LMS , and building a new Version of our product to be built around Soc out of the gate

                              <span>I am upgrading our ERP system this weekend. Rather, I should say I am coordinating between 3 different vendors upgrading our ERP system. In our non-production systems, the best timing I could get for the activity was about 15 hours. Then 2 hours for checkout. So I have been advertising a 18 hour outage to give me some slush time. Coming in a couple hours early would make everyone happy, and running over would be painful, so having a little extra fluff was great (AKA The Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott Engineering Rule).
 Cut to today. Had everything in place, management was frothing to get this going. They were all on the phone call for the official &#x27;Go&#x27; decision. Then the inexplicable happens. Total time needed to complete: 7 hours, including checkout. WTF? Am I happy the upgrade went smooth and finished with zero issues, yes? But, WTF?
 15 minutes after the note to the users that the system was ready, I got my first email from management wanting to know who was responsible for missing the target by 10 hours. Some of the overseas sites are upset because they rescheduled manufacturing and warehousing schedules based on my estimate. Now I have to spend the next week explaining why my vendors seemed to be &#x27;sandbagging&#x27; the non-prod systems and padding their numbers. Plus my credibility next time I go to ask for a production window is shot now.

                              <span>I work at a startup and business has started ramping up. We are now deploying about 100-200 windows 10 devices per week. Each device needs some software uploaded and settings changed. We have been using Ghost32 to image them. With unboxing, imaging, and licensing each device - each unit takes me about 7-10 minutes. 
 I think I am looking for something like Kubernetes or Puppet to help with orchestration. I have also read up of Chef and Ansible. Before I dive really deep into any of these, I wanted to see what you guys are using to accomplish this? Or is there a better way that I am not thinking of?

                              <span>I have been working as an IT support specialist for the past five months. Unfortunately, the IT department has been overlooked and not seen as an asset for the company&#x27;s growth, as they have been focusing on acquiring smaller businesses in recent years. The IT manager has experience with managed service providers and is skilled in project management, with previous knowledge of IT infrastructure. Therefore, the department is being managed by someone who is proficient in growing and documenting processes, as the company has a lack of documentation in general.
 My goal is to better manage the IT department and help it grow. I am interested in knowing the difference between an IT support specialist and a systems administrator and how I can develop my skills to become a future systems administrator for the company. I am eager to learn more about network administration, server management, and security management and pursue relevant certifications, such as Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), or CompTIA Security+. Additionally, I plan to work with my IT manager to develop and document IT processes and protocols, including standard operating procedures and user guides, to establish a strong foundation for the IT department.

 I’m working on getting a laptop on one of the specific WiFis on Unifi. Here’s the setup:
 NPS running on Windows Server 2022 std (running on Hyper-V) CA running on same server Self-signed cert in trusted store AD group for machines that will use RADIUS (only the one laptop, for testing) RADIUS client is set as UDM which manages 5 APs that the laptop can talk to Connection request policy also set to UDM IP Network policy grants access, is enabled, to Windows RADIUS group, NAS port type 802.11/ wireless Constraints set to auth method PEAP/EAP Cert for EAP set to NPS servers cert RADIUS standard attributes framed-protocol/PPP Unifi RADIUS profile created, shared secret the same for RADIUS client and Unifi profile, ports both set as 1812/1813 (auth/accounting)
 Trying to get the laptop to connect to network X tells me “checking network requirements”, “can’t connect” - does this when I’m running WPA3-Ent or WPA2-Ent, even WPA2- personal with passcode, enter passcode, checks network requirements, can’t connect.
 Any help would be appreciate!
 EDIT: also should note, there’s a duo auth proxy for the VPN that also uses this NPS, has an NPS client set as localhost

                              <span>Have an interview for a place I really want in a few days. Have a second interview for a place two days after that and I&#x27;m 99 percent sure they will offer me the job. 
 If I say &quot;yes&quot; to the second interview and will start in two weeks, how bad is it to cancel on them if the first job calls me back wanting to hire me?

                              <span>We are trying to decide if per user or per device licenses will be the most economical for server CALs.
 Human employee count vs AD account count? What about service accounts? What about disabled accounts of former employees kept for retention history reasons?
 If you set up per-user licensing for server CALS and a worker has multiple dedicated accounts for specific tasks (daily user account, local admin account, server admin account, application admin account, domain admin account etc.), would each account in AD for each person need to be added to the license count for per-user licensing?

                              <span>University admin here.
 We are currently in the process of implementing security solutions to effectively manage approximately 300 enterprise devices. These devices are primarily used within the corporate network. Students use personal machines (BYOD), including a mix of Windows and macOS. Currently, we have Fortigate firewalls with 2 redundant internet connections
 We use Azure AD as our main IDP. Our entire workforce relies solely on SaaS apps, we don&#x27;t have anything critical in our university on-prem
 For enterprise devices, we&#x27;re looking for full control, management, 802.1x authentication, and visibility.
 For Student BYOD devices (2000+) we&#x27;re looking for zero-trust access solutions for control and visibility when accessing SaaS apps. Students must have access within or outside the university network.
 We are looking into only cloud options.
 I&#x27;m looking for any tips or recommendations from people who have managed and secured a similar environment in the past. Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a task where an input file which is in yaml format with OIDC/Saml App configuration details(from secureAuth) has to be transformed to a xml metadata file or post request with key parameters for ForgeRock(or any other IDP) with the respective value retrieved from the yaml file, to create app configuration.
 Is there any such open source library or project which is currently shared with the community. We intend to design in similar way for this use case scenario as well.

 Microsoft say number matching is the default from 8th but when I enabled push in the legacy MFA settings section it didn&#x27;t always do number matching when I logged in to test.
 Sometimes it did number matching and sometimes it did a regular approve/reject push that was just with Outlook and the aka.ms/mfasetup logins.
 Is this normal?
 We&#x27;d like to use number matching and all the guides look like that&#x27;s now the default so I don&#x27;t get why it did a normal push.

 I have tried all the basic troubleshooting steps like rebooting, clearing cache, flushing Windows DNS resolver cache, even gone as far as nuking my PC and re-installing Windows. It is absolutley baffeling.
 My web server is being hosted on a VM in TrueNAS Core, running Ubuntu Server 22.04.2 LTS, and all the usual other packages, i.e. Apache2, MySQL, etc etc. It is a fully functioning server, as I say I can access it from outside of my home network perfectly fine.
 I am not sure if it is the culprit, but I do have a Raspberry Pi on my network running Pi-hole. I have tried to whitelist my domain, disable it, change upstream DNS server between Google and Cloudflare, but to no avail. I&#x27;ve even tried removing it from the network all together.

                              <span>Hi everyone !!
 First I&#x27;m new in admin/network (student/1st y internship in admin) and I try my best to learn the fundamentals sorry if I ask dumb question !
 I have a thesis to do for my school year and my subject is about the implementation of RADIUS server and 802.1X for wired et wireless (via VPN too) connection to network.
 I have 3 questions :
 Is it possible to do a &quot;full&quot; virtualization of this infrastructure ? I want something like packet tracer do(or GNS3 but never used it before) to configure 802.1X on switch port, a windows server with NAPS-&gt;NPS fonctionnality, test wired and wireless login.
 I belive it&#x27;s possible to do 802.1X on packet tracer but for the windows server configuration ? It&#x27;s possible to create VM on packet tracer, or the &#x27;graphical&#x27; interface on the computers is enough ?
 2) Ok for local connection, what about VPN ? It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m learning on my own but never install/configure one from now, is it difficult to link with RADIUS ?
 3) For now I want to build my own classic RADIUS lab but I think I&#x27;m screwed to do it in entreprise... Because we have a hybrid/full cloud infrastructure in Azure AD. I think it&#x27;s a total another lvl of difficulty . Does anyone know more about this ?
 I&#x27;m not alone in my entreprise, we have a provider to take care of network tasks et management but he is not often there and I don&#x27;t dare to ask basic question :(
 I&#x27;m trying to be very proactive on the subject (it&#x27;s for october so it&#x27;s pretty soon I think), I will keep you up about this !
 Thanks

 It would do what I need, but I need a full API not (only) a web interface. 
 It has to be on-premises. No SaaS. 
 We currently use simple relays, but we can’t authenticate the mails and maintaining the IP whitelists is tedious and may not be feasible in the future.

 After 20 yrs with the same company(accounting firm), I terminated my employment and sought out a dream job in the Space industry. It was a long interview (4 weeks), but I accepted a position with a satellite launch company. I&#x27;m a space nerd and this is a dream job for me.
 So if you are looking for career advice, read the forum. I cherry-picked advice and found out what worked for me. So best of luck to everyone looking and another Thank You to everyone posting career advice.

I’m not very familiar with this and am still learning a lot of things, so if I seem lost, I’m sorry :(
 All devices have the latest iOS (16.4.1) if that helps and all have the ability to scan QR codes from the camera app.

                              <span>Note: the system this post refers to is on premise.
 I&#x27;m not a sysadmin, so I could be wrong about this, but it seems wrong to me that to RDP into the computers in the DMZ, I need to remember/maintain a local windows account for each computer in the DMZ (we have several dozen). These accounts&#x27; passwords also expire after a month, which makes managing the accounts even more difficult. I have searched the web for what is considered best practice, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything I can understand. I&#x27;ve seen a few posts about Read Only Domain Controllers and Jump Servers, but as a non sysadmin, I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding these.
 Now that you understand my question, let me give you a brief explanation of our system.
 The system is entirely on prem. At the front, we have a load balancer with a public IP. This is what our customers connect to. Behind the load balancer, we have the DMZ. The DMZ contains a number of windows server VMs running IIS. Behind the DMZ, we have our AD network. This is where our application and database server are. It&#x27;s also where the computers used by our staff are.
 As a user of the system, my computer is in the AD network. As I mentioned earlier, I sometimes need to RDP into a server in the DMZ. Ideally, I would just use my AD credentials to authenticate, but that doesn&#x27;t work because the DMZ is not part of the AD network.
 So, could you please tell me if the best way to connect to the servers in the DMZ is via local windows accounts? Another thing I&#x27;d like to know is, is a DMZ even necessary? Why can&#x27;t the load balancer just route to the appropriate computer in the AD network?

                              <span>So we have a major SaaS EMR vendor we use by clinical staff (healthcare org) contacting us demanding that if we want to continue receiving emailed daily patient reports from them, due to a &quot;bug&quot; they recently fixed, they will now require SMTP information. From us. To receive emails addressed to us.
 Specifically, we need to provide them with:
  
Mail Server name and port username password default sender email security type(SSL/TLS/None)
  
Has a vendor ever asked you for this information? It seems bizarre we would have to provide our own server to email ourselves. How would you even do this securely?
 Oh, and we can&#x27;t input this information ourselves -- we need to give it to them so THEY can set it up on their end! Sure, I&#x27;ll get right on emailing you a username and password to connect to our Exchange server.
 Our users just want to continue receiving these emails.

                              <span>Hey everyone. So I work in k12 and I&#x27;ve got this project that I&#x27;m working to implement over the summer and I was wanting some advice from those who are more network savvy than I am since I&#x27;m still pretty junior in this role.
 I&#x27;ve got 5 campuses all with their own NVRs on-prem to support their respective IP cameras. Each campus is connected to our main MDF/Server room via 10Gb Fiber connections in a Hub/Spoke topology. The idea here is to get rid of the old NVRs (they suck and require Edge in IE mode to even use) and move everything to a single server in our server room.
 The campuses all have the cameras on their own subnets but while some campuses have a completely isolated set of switches that only connect to cameras and the NVR, some of the older campuses don&#x27;t have isolated switches and simply rely on VLANs.
 So basically this is what I have: 5 Campuses with their own subnets, some with dedicated switches, others with dedicated VLANs (Security).
  
172.16.50.0/24
 172.17.50.0/24
 172.18.50.0/24
 172.19.50.0/24
 172.20.50.0/24
  
I need to remove the NVRs and get them talking to a server located at 10.0.9.75.
 Now what I would *think* I need to do, is simply make sure all physical ports that cameras are located on are simply Untagged with the security VLAN, and make sure all successive uplinks between switches all the way back to the core switch (which the server will be connected to) are Tagged with the security VLAN.
 One of my big concerns is whether or not I need to implement any kind of Layer 3 routing (beyond what we already have) with this setup. I don&#x27;t believe I do, but I would like advice on this if at all possible. 
 Please let me know if it seems like I&#x27;ve left something out or if I can answer any questions that might help better explain. Thank you

                              <span>After the recent incident with Viptela V-Edge we’re looking into a solution to get OOB Console access to all of our branch routers. In addition we’ve been fighting for funding to get a 4G/5G WAN failover for a while.
 Management finally said we can get cellular boxes, if we can get the wan failover piece and the OOB Console Service in one solution, so we can maximize value…
 But as I’m shopping around it really seems more like an “one or the other” situation?
 We want something top of the line, cradlepoint and open gear both look great, but can it do both with one SIM Card?

                              <span>Hi all. I have set all ports on a switch to be vlan 3 and untagged vlan 3. I realized my mistake too late when I couldn&#x27;t access the switch web ui.
 I&#x27;m using Linux and I&#x27;m sort of familiar with creating new interfaces and adding a vlan tag to it but I only mention this because I thought I could just try to access the switch by setting a static IP and vlan.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there really is a way to get back in to it. I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful in my attempts but thankfully I can switch it to unmanaged so connected computers can use it.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking for a fix for my mistake here.

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting security subscription renewal alerts for my Firebox T70 - which has worked great. What&#x27;s the value in renewing? I&#x27;ve never used their tech support, as I have my own team for that. I don&#x27;t need hardware replacement until I have a failure.
 Are the latest security updates worth it?
 My last IT person took care of this and I don&#x27;t recall more than one or two security updates over the years unless he was doing extras on the weekend he didn&#x27;t alert anyone to.
 Opinions on cost and value?

                              <span>Hi r/networking!
 I&#x27;m looking for an open source DNS server that can respond to queries by fetching data from a web API that I will configure. I came across Technitium DNS Server, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet and I&#x27;m not sure if it meets our requirements.
 Our goal is to scale https://pinggy.io horizontally, and to achieve this, we need a DNS server that can respond to queries with data from a database. Ideally, the DNS server would forward the query to a web API that we will create, and the web API will respond with the DNS response.
 Do you know of any open source DNS servers that can do this? Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have only a /24 from the days where IPs weren’t a sacred thing. Across my 4 512GB hypervisor I’m using most of that space on applications for myself and clients. I will be deploying 28 additional machines next week yet I only have /27 left. 
 Will I be able to create a gateway /32 and have a VLAN for each uplink on my switch that will allocate a /32 public address and share the /32 gateway without any security vulnerabilities for packet sniffing between machines?

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;ve been tasked with converting a largish network from mixed EIGRP and OSPF to fully OSPF. I know I can usually run the two alongside each other since default admin distances are different, however, my dilemma is that EIGRP is running everywhere except between a core switch and a firewall out to the internet. The core switch and firewall are OSPF neighbors. The core switch is redistributing the OSPF and EIGRP tables into each other. Can I go ahead and safely stand up OSPF between this core switch and all downstream switches without causing routing loops? Or will I be stuck with taking down EIGRP before configuring OSPF?

 We mostly use it for lightweight access point management &amp; maps, client history (seeing what AP/switch ports a machine has been on), pushing &amp; backup up configs, though this one isn&#x27;t a huge deal as I know there are other good tools for this.

The ASA has a tunnel-group configured in this goofy format (tunnel-group &quot;ABC Taiwan VPN&quot; instead of ABC_Taiwan_VPN, the problem with this format is when setting up Identifier ID on Azure side you can&#x27;t add anything that are quotations mark, my question is what is the best way to fix the tunnel-group naming format within the ASA5500.

                              <span>Our system could not be accessed from a specific site location today. The platform that is hosted on AWS was being blocked because traffic was routing to a Germany region IP and not one of the US East region IPs that our organization is hosted on. Once we unblocked Germany traffic it went right through. We narrowed it down to being a global IP that our phone system should never redirect us to because our org is not hosted in that region
 Without sharing too much information, is it possible that Cisco umbrella or our vpn could be causing this issue, or is it more likely that AWS or the platform provider redirected their traffic due to an issue on their end?

However, I seem to find conflicting information in their documentation on the correct topology. Some of their documents have it connected directly to the LAN, while others have it connected to the gateway.
 For anyone using it in this manner, may I please ask how you have it connected to your network(s)?

 I am not sure if I am at the right place to ask this, but here I go!
 I got a request from our QA team, they would like to have the ability to perform some test on our apps by simulating different network conditions, let say for adding some jitter, latency or reduce bandwidth a very low value.
 I can do some basic bandwidth throttling in the FW, but was wondering if anyone has a suggestion on how this can be perform and/or how I could give them as much control on the test they would like to perform.
 Thanx for you help!

 After rebooting when entering config mode we got the following message:
 No configuration commits for this SDR will be allowed until a &#x27;clear configuration inconsistency&#x27; command is performed. 
 Apparently all the L2VPN configuration was not applied on startup.
 Any ideas on how to prevent this in the future or what I should look into?

 Im looking for technical support:
 I started working for a company where ewe offer terminal Server to our customers with RDP connection and those freeze for some customers. I looked up ways to test the network/protocols/internet connections and found iperf3. 
 Its been pretty helpful so far and I managed to solve/greatly improve the freezing situation with some cusotmers already but one thing keeps happening with every time I test: Trying to run the iperf command with multiple UPD streams simultaniously just starts - Giving me the message about a connection being established with port XYZ, but then just does not run - which I can see because if it runs, it spits out a line for each intervall on what happened. 
 Ive made a post here already, but no answer so far:

                              <span>A similar process has existed for many years dating back to the old Microsoft DirectAccess and their newer Always On VPN machine tunnels, but this question is specifically about the Cisco Management VPN Tunnels.
 First, I am seeing conflicting information whether or not the management tunnel should be full tunnel or not.
 TunnelAll even though it should only be providing access to domain controller, DNS etc. to allow domain joined Windows laptops to sign in without cached credentials? Does that make sense?
 There are also security concerns about the laptops having internal network access using the machine certificate and no password.
 Does the VPN tunnel do real time certificate validation so that if a laptop is reported stolen and IT revokes the certificate and/or disables the machine account in Active Directory, will new connections to the management tunnel access be immediately revoked or will someone managing the ASA need to take some manual action to prevent further access from the system?

 Any Umbrella SIC users here?
 Trying to establish a tunnel from Umbrella SIG and despite following confusing instructions - the tunnel won&#x27;t come up.
 Things get compounded by the fact that there&#x27;s no VPN logging in Umbrella UI.

                              <span>RFC 4604 Using IGMPv3 and MLDv2 for Source-Specific Multicast:
 2.2.3. IGMPv1 Queries, IGMPv2 and MLDv1 General Queries
  
If an IGMPv1 Query, or an IGMPv2 or MLDv1 General Query is received, the SFGMP protocol specifications require the host to revert to the older (IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1) mode of operation on that interface. 
 If this occurs, the host will stop reporting source-specific subscriptions on that interface and will start using IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 to report interest in all SSM destination addresses, unqualified by a source address. 
 As a result, SSM semantics will no longer be applied to the multicast group address by the router. 
 A router compliant with this document would never generate an IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 query for an address in the SSM range
  
How does it make sense, to say &quot;[General] query for an address in the SSM range&quot;?
 I&#x27;m not confusing this sentence with Group-Specific Queries, because for them in RFC 4604 is seperate section.
 Routers send General Queries empty without an address:
 RFC 2236 IGMPv2
  
In a Membership Query message, the group address field is set to zero when sending a General Query
  
And they send it to all hosts via 224.0.0.1.
 RFC 2236 IGMPv2
  
A General Query is addressed to the all-systems multicast group (224.0.0.1)
  
How should it be possible, to forbid General Queries to the SSM range (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255), when all hosts receive the Queries?
 The only possibilites what this means:
  
A Router never generates IGMPv1/IGMPv2/MLDv1 Queries? (But then why it mention explicit for SSM range?)
 I missunderstand something completely.

                              <span>We have a largish data center with a lot of automation centered on Netbox as our source of truth. Very happy with it. (switch configurations, DNS entries, DHCP scopes &amp; reservations all automatically created from the netbox model)
 I&#x27;ve been asked to replace our current DNS and DHCP servers (bind and ISC Kea) with Infoblox DDI. I have no Infoblox experience, but I hear good things.
 I&#x27;m concerned that Infoblox&#x27;s builtin IPAM functionality might interfere (or integrate poorly) with the Netbox IPAM model we currently use. 
 Does anyone here have experience integrating these applications? Thoughts or recommendations on how get the best out of both applications in a highly netdevops environment?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey folks.
 I&#x27;ve been working on an issue with a customer where they have some VPN tunnels going through our service that has some issues affecting speeds for their applications. They have logs from their Cisco FTD about failed anti-replay checking. I don&#x27;t really want to get into the specifics on this, since I think the out of order packets is a red herring, but it did get me thinking about what is &quot;normal&quot; in these circumstances over the internet.
 I took some packet captures from our router at their branch site. I can see all tunnel packets being forwarded in perfect order ip.id 11, 12, 13, 14 etc. On the remote peer of this tunnel, I can see these tunnel packets arriving ever so slightly out of order intermittently, by about 1-3 packets. So for example, 23, 24, 26, 25 .... then 62, 63, 66, 64, 65. Again, a very low number of packets are actually out of order, something like a few hundred packets out of a capture file that is 100k packets in size. I am using the IPv4 Identification field to count and identify the packets, as our tunnel is a single stream, so I believe this should be valid.
 TLDR; As a UDP flow crosses the internet, is it normal for their to a very, very small amount of re-ordering? There is a lot of different physical media used by providers, carriers to provide transport and connectivity. Also, there LAG&#x27;s and different speed links, then QoS and queuing.... I&#x27;m not too experienced to know what is normal here or not. Anyone that can shed some light here?

                              <span>Hi All
 I have a question concerning a topic I never really found much actual objective information about: Packet queues and buffer depth on high throughput devices.
 Obviously not talking about dedicated hardware routers or virtual routers.
 Basically, the argument goes that some people put layer 3 switches at their edge and go &quot;well that works&quot;. And the are right. But some people argue that because of the shallow buffers on those devices they aren&#x27;t suited for edge routing.
 Same in the data center where I heard people say that the major reason that catalyst switches aren&#x27;t suited for data center is the fact they have very shallow buffers compared to Nexus or other data center switches. I know for fiberchannel this is a major issue, but for iSCSI this is... not so much an issue. FCoE, the less said the better...
 Is this BS or is there truth in this? I haven&#x27;t ever heard anything more than anecdotal evidence for this argument concerning buffer depth.
 Thanks :)

                              <span>I have always wondered about the actual benefit of using two firewalls in a high availability setup, syncing with each other and providing redundancy if one were to fail.
 What confuses me is that you have a single point of failure at the WAN switch between them and your modem, which is also typically a single point of failure as you usually only get one handoff. Am I missing something here with this logic? Or is there a better way to truly provide redundancy for WAN interfaces?

                              <span>What would you consider a good amount of time for the following account creation+full desktop setup:
  
User creation, group assignment in AD, sync to AzAD
 AzAD licensing
 Unboxing a computer + OOBE for local admin creation
 AzAD join, change hostname, run Windows Update + OEM&#x27;s firmware update software, reboot
 Login as user, check for any more updates, potentially reboot again
 Install M365 apps + Teams
 Manually license Adobe Team&#x27;s license, install Adobe Acrobat Pro
 Manually license TeamViewer, install
 Install Firefox, set as default, set up a handful of bookmarks
 Manually license and install Egnyte
 Install WinZIP
 Install one bespoke software
 Depending on the user, install one to two more bespoke software
 Install two required Outlook add-ins
 Update one of the add-ins because its public installer isn&#x27;t up-to-date for some insane reason 🙄
 Set Office Apps to compatibility mode for monitors
 Share calendar details with entire organization
 Install organization themes
 Install printers
 Install Zoom and its add-ins
 Clean everything up and run a script to change device owner in AzAD from user to global admin
  
Yes, I know a lot of this could be automated with unattend files, an image server, etc.
 The DC is legacy and needs to be deprecated and everything needs to migrate from hybrid to full-cloud.
 And all those applications should be SAML/SSO.
 But all of those things cost time and money, and I&#x27;ve been told no about each of them.
 I took flak from a higher-up non-technical person today because a set of deployments took a while (in the hours range, not the days range). I&#x27;m wondering how long someone else thinks this takes.
 EDIT: Lovin&#x27; the suggestions so far. One note: as soon as I&#x27;m able to the DC is getting put down, and that is my last device that /could/ run anything like an imaging server.

Want to see if there&#x27;s any one else that makes switches as robust as IOGear but at a more economic pricing. What do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Just wanna thank everyone for their advice in the previous post. I didn&#x27;t reply to many comments but I took the time to read them and consider what was being said. As some mentioned, I tried to re-pitch my ideas using more business terms and to try to frame the proposal as more of a risk management type of thing. The CTO&#x27;s response to that was that it&#x27;s too high-level and she wants more details.
 So I tried again (for the 4th time) with the following 2 items :
 - buying an EDR solution and installing it on every endpoint to protect from ransomware and other viruses
 - buying Windows Pro for the laptops and Azure AD P1
 Both of these suggestions were again rejected because:
 a) they were not detailed enough and didn&#x27;t show how the cost of the licenses would bring value to the company
 b) she claimed that we already have Azure AD. I had previously showed her that we have Azure AD Free which includes very few features and is certainly not enough to get where we want to go. Is she intentionally lying because she doesn&#x27;t want to spend on a P1 license? did she not check the console to confirm what she said? It&#x27;s not like this is a matter of opinion, she&#x27;s just refusing to see what&#x27;s there.
 So yeah, I tried again before giving up but at this point I just don&#x27;t see why I would spend more time fighting with this person who clearly has no intention of helping me in my duties.
 Also note: I confirmed they&#x27;re aiming for ISO 27001 certification - she said they previously had it in 2019 but it expired. Not sure how that&#x27;s possible but I saw the certificate myself so it&#x27;s true.
 EDIT: Just to clarify, the ISO certification is from 2018 and applies to software development and software products and services only. There was no surveillance audit done after the certification and it was not renewed. I haven&#x27;t been able to obtain the documents from the original audit yet to look at what they evaluated.

 Fast-forward 10 years: Currently a hybrid admin for higher ed (aka actual admin tasks like Zendesk / JAMF / Azure / etc administration mixed with helpdesk / desktop support).
 Been here for 5 years and finally feel secure enough in all aspects to take them up on their (basically free) tuition for staff. 
 I previously majored in film but considered pivoting those credits towards something else. I also had to pull a few strings to even get here because my resume was insta-trashed due to no degree in the first place.
 If you had the opportunity for a basically free, albeit slow degree, what would you study?

                              <span>5 years ago I was hired to work at a private school. Helpdesk plus, because they wanted me but my skillset was above helpdesk so they paid me a bit more and gave me more to do. 3 people, 100 employees, 200+ students.
 2 years later the boss leaves for another state. Family reasons. my coworker and I absorb his job, he gets the hot seat and I take on the Sys admin roles and most user facing duties. We work more like a team then a boss/subordinate pairing and life is good, though a bit overworked. We&#x27;re not just coworkers, were friends, and this makes life immensely more bearable.
 3 years later I find myself locking his accounts and shutting down his keycards. Didn&#x27;t have a great year and a lot of personal issue&#x27;s. He left amicably, and there&#x27;s no bitterness about it. it may be best for him to get a fresh start. A least thats what we decided the takeaway should be.
 But that leaves me, a one man shop. I know enough to keep the school running, but I dont even know who I answer to officially. They told me that I&#x27;ll learn how to do the budget stuff for the department Monday, but they literally just had my &quot;Letter of Agreement&quot; renewal 20 minutes before they told my boss he was leaving and there was no discussion of a title change or a raise. Apparently, they&#x27;ve been talking to an MSP and some restructuring, but I&#x27;ve been told my job is secure.
 I&#x27;m still a bit numb and trying to process it all. I don&#x27;t want to leave my job, I absolutely love where I am and what I do. but since everyone else rants on this sub about their job I figured I would pour some stress into the webs as well... And I have so many god damn passwords to change now! (Already started on the major one of course, but holy hell there are a lot)

                              <span>I have a basic folder structure which is:
 D:\Data\Folder1
 D:\Data\Folder2
 D:\Data\Folder3
 Shared out at the &quot;Data&quot; folder level so users map to \\server\data
 It&#x27;s a SMB with no real specific permissions so right now the permissions are basically flat.
 I need to make it so users can&#x27;t accidentally delete or move the top level Folder1, Folder2 and Folder3 folders.
 Generally I avoid deny permissions but for this they seem the most appropriate way of doing it.
 How would you do this please?

                              <span>Been seeing this trend of people working from anywhere with just a laptop! While is sounds cool, I can maybe do a couple hours of work off a single laptop screen but after a bit my neck hurts my back is hurting and frustrated from constantly minimizing and maximizing stuff. Is it just me or does everyone else need at minimum two full sized monitors to be productive and a mouse!

                              <span>I discovered this accidentally, while using PowerShell to review who had access to my calendar. I brought it to the attention of my boss during our weekly one-on-one. After the meeting I audited the person&#x27;s access to mailboxes and found they had full access to Senior Officers mailboxes. This access was not delegated by the affected users, no tickets granting access, no review.
 This is the second time I&#x27;ve caught this person doing this. I&#x27;m unsure if I should take it directly to HR or just let management take it from here. The last time, nothing came of it and it never went beyond the team&#x27;s manager.

                              <span>How do you guys handle saying no to certain requests? I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of requests that are very loosely related to IT lately and I am struggling to know where the line is. Many of these requests are graphic design, marketing, basic management tasks, etc. None of them require IT involvement from an authorization or permission standpoint. As an an example I was recently given a vector image with some text on it and asked to extrapolate that text into a complete font that could be used in Microsoft Word. Just because it requires a computer doesn&#x27;t make it an IT task! 
 Thanks for the input and opinions!

                              <span>I am dealing with 1 forest - 1 domain and multiple OUs, one for each separate site.
 The replication between Domain Servers works fine. 
 I have deployed 2 new GPs to a couple of sites (OUs) with no issues. 
 ​
 Now I am dealing with the 3rd site OU, with the same GPs applied to that site&#x27;s specific security group but they&#x27;re not being applied to none of the PCs or users involved. Enforcing doesn&#x27;t do anything. gpupdate completes successfully but gpresult shows nothing (nothing blocked either).
 ​
 What could be causing this? I don&#x27;t know where to look further.

                              <span>I had a user yesterday receive a phishing email with a link to &#x27;keep his password&#x27;. This email made it through our email filtering. It was sent by a legitimate business whose email address had been compromised. Our associate clicked this link which took them to a website mimicking a Microsoft login page. He typed his credentials in. At this point the malicious party had his credentials and attempted to sign into his account. The associate received the Microsoft Authenticator push notification. The push notification presented numbers that the party attempting to login would need to enter in order to gain access. This was new to the associate. He was used to the simple &#x27;approve&#x27; or &#x27;deny&#x27; buttons on the push notification. He admitted that they would have hit the &#x27;approve&#x27; button if it would have been presented.
 In last month&#x27;s meeting with executive management I explained the the CA policies we have in place for our 365 logins. Only 25% of our 365 accounts need to be able to connect from outside our facility (manufacturing), so we have a CA policy that prevents 75% of our accounts from connecting outside the facility. We also have a CA policy blocking connections from all countries other than USA, with an exception group we can temporarily add an associate&#x27;s account to for international travel. We have a CA policy enforcing MFA for all logins and a CA policy that requires modern auth clients to use approved client apps and protection policies.
 During this meeting I explained that we would be rolling out Number Matching for our push notifications. I explained that the flaw in the push notification is that associates are so used to approval prompts on their cellphones, that the chances of them approving an illegitimate login is quite likely.
 It feels good to have that validation that you&#x27;re not just talking crazy and that the scenarios you lay out actually can and will happen.

                              <span>We replaced our heavy volume printers with Ricoh 8400 machines and the print is way slower than our old HPs. I&#x27;ve figured out the reason is because every page that prints gets flipped in the duplexer even if the print is only one-sided. We have to load the paper in the trays upside down so it will print on the correct side. I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to correct this anyone have any ideas?

 How can I find more info on this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with trying to find out when a user has logged on and off over the last 30 days. I&#x27;ve been looking through the event logs using event ID 4624. It shows so many of them. I need to find the one&#x27;s where he physically logs on and off or RDPs into it. What is the easiest way to find these without going through each log trying to find the logon type? Thank you.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have LAPS deployed to all of our laptops, however its a gamble if the passwords work when I need them to for remote users. From what I understand, LAPS requires Group Policy refreshes and such to check-in or sync from time to time. Since we don&#x27;t have VPN for end users to touch the DC&#x27;s while offsite, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s part of the issue with the passwords not working.
 Am wondering if anyone has an alternative? Just need to run a CMD prompt as Admin on remote users laptops for installs, open Device Manager as Admin etc, nothing fancy.
 One thought is to write a system level service that&#x27;s deployed on all laptops. The service can be invoked under the user context and get permission to run Admin level commands from some from of Azure authentication that doesn&#x27;t require VPN or on-prem DC&#x27;s. 
 I&#x27;m willing to research and develop this, however just want to know if some existing solution is already out there. Not interested in packaging apps with Intune. Trying to make this simpler and &#x27;just work&#x27;.
 What are your thoughts?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 Cant quite find the answer i am looking for so thought i would ask here.
 I have a pair of 2012 R2 Hyper V hosts running a bunch of 2012 R2 Guests with one guest being a 2019 DC.
 I want (Need!) to upgrade the 2012R2 Guest servers to 2019/2022 (2019 based on the up2 suggestions)
 Can i just mount the media and run the usual in place upgrade steps and if so, is it recommended. Will a Checkpoint work for recovery should the upgrade fail? If no to both, what would you (should i) Do to get from 2012R2 to 2019 with the least disruption.
 I will deal with the Hyper V hosts another time; we might be able to replace them with some new poweredge hosts on 22 and just live migrate / replicate the guests over.
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are a machine building company. Up till now, we&#x27;ve been using Teamviewer for remote access to our machines. These machines are installed all over the world, and they all have a Windows PC on board, so Teamviewer was an easy way for remote access/support.
 However we want to move away from Teamviewer for 2 reasons:
 - security : we don&#x27;t want to use Teamviewer anymore, as it introduces a security risk in the customers network.
 - user friendliness: Teamviewer recently had a complete overhaul of it&#x27;s UI. Nobody likes it anymore.
 So as a solution, we want to equip all our machines with a VPN gateway device (eg Ewon or IXON). That way, we can connect via VPN to our machine local network (much safer). Once that we are connected via VPN, we can use VNC to remotely control the machine PC.
 I just started evaluating the different VNC implementations (TightVNC, ultraVNC,...). However they have not changed since I&#x27;ve used them about twenty years ago.
 I am missing drag and drop support for file transfer and performance (fluent updates) is way worse than Teamviewer. I also checked out Windows Quick Assist, but this requires manual starting the connection at the customer side. We need an &#x27;always on&#x27; server service so we can connect to the machine anytime.
 Does anybody has some suggestions for remote access that works (like VNC) only in a LAN (so no Teamviewer, Anydesk, Splashtop,...)
 Thx,
 Thomas.

                              <span>Hoping this is the right spot for this. Yesterday I logged on to one of our servers and got a pop-up telling me that something called Program already existed and could cause issues with programs running. I looked on the C drive and there was a file called Program that was like 125MB in size. I couldn&#x27;t find the original source of the file and my antivirus said it was clean. Today I had a user come to me because they had the same exact thing happen but the filesize was zero. Kind of concerned this may be malware but can&#x27;t verify for sure.

                              <span>Hello folks
 I have a self-build server at home with 8 drives and 4x nVME M2 SSD. Running proxmox on it with TrueNAS VM and my other LXC containers. So my PC case is full now (i have depleted PCIe expansion slots as well).
 On TrueNAS VM I have ZFS pool with 2 vdevs (1 vdev is 2x6TB mirrored 3.5 HDD) with 12TB storage. Yesterday I got notification from TrueNAS that pool is almost on 80% capacity.
 Can I get some tips on how to proceed with expanding storage ? I though about scaling out via Ceph cluster, but I suppose I will need to reconfigure my whole storage for this. I am planning to scale up to 24TB for example. I am using storage for my movie collection(Plex), family photos and games.
 Second problem is I have mounted storage on my promox containers in /foo/bar. Is possible to mount 2 different network storages to same location ie. tank1 and tank2 storage in /foo/bar ?
 Thanks for any tips and explanation.

                              <span>Single sysadmin, about 350 endpoints currently, but we are currently experiencing rapid growth and are expecting that number to be about 500 by the end of the summer. It comes out to around 6k, which I can justify pretty easily, but want opinions before that money gets spent. 
 I am looking into getting SmartDeploy, since I image quite a lot. Being vague, every month we get a new group of students, so I am looking at about 20-30 monthly. Those come back to me after the class ends, and need to get reimaged for the next person. Add on top of that new hires, a lot of my time is taken up with building laptops. 
 These do get taken offsite. 
 I currently have no device management system other than a remote connection software. This was an extremely small company before me, and the previous sysadmin did not scale up his shop to correlate with the rapid growth of the company. I&#x27;m basically building everything up. 
 Anyway - thoughts on SmartDeploy? Pros? Cons? Any other recommendations?

 I am working on stepping up our imaging of desktops/laptops procedures. We use MDT along with PDQ for imaging. However, what alternatives should I look at if our Imaging environment were to get compromised along with desktops/laptops?
 Maybe create a base image with all the applications/settings and slap it on a USB drive? How would you handle &quot;backup&quot; imaging solutions if a Cyber/DR Incident were to occur?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have 5 Domain controllers in my business environment and one of the controllers is only syncing in one direction. It is sending out its changes to the other controllers but when you make a change on any of the other sites this one problematic controller doesn&#x27;t see them. Any suggestions on what to troubleshoot would be helpful. Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>Our company recently hired a new CIO, and a big part of his role will be re-engineering our IT infrastructure.
 The new CIO seems very keen on getting rid of the server room altogether. He wants to move &quot;everything into the cloud&quot; including AD users, servers, network infrastructure, physical firewalls, endpoint security, web security gateway, DNS filtering, 802.1x authentication for wired and wireless users, endpoint management, network performance monitoring, file shares, and all business applications to SaaS.
 Currently, we have only emails on O365, 50% of servers on-prem with a quite traditional network with VLAN routed on the core switch and perimeter firewall high bandwidth redundant internet connections.
 Does anyone else have experience doing this type of transition? What are some of the solutions or architecture you guys would advise to satisfy the requirements?

                              <span>Hello ! I&#x27;m doing a lot of learning in my own labs recently and I noticed something a bit odd.
 I set up banned word list on Azure AD. It includes, for example, all fruits and animals. I understand how the password strength is calculated behind the scenes so even with my word list, the following password is accepted on AAD: Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee!
 ​
 I installed the agent and proxy right on the DC of my VM lab. I check the Event Viewer logs to track what happens. 
 However, this password above is not accepted. I guess it&#x27;s because it has the banned words? 
 So it gives me the impression that the Azure Password Protection agent does an exact match to the word list. If the password contains any of the banned words, then It&#x27;s rejected. However, on AAD, I can change the password to Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee! and Writeback seems to set it on premises as well.
 I feel like I am not understanding something ... Is this the expected behaviour? Or perhaps the configuration is missing something? Is it failing because the default password policy on a fresh Server 2019 DC requires numbers as well? (Just thought of this as I was writing this post).
 Thanks! You don&#x27;t know how much I appreciate comments from experienced admins. I learn so much from y&#x27;all.

 So, this thing is annoying me in such a way that the part of my hair that&#x27;s not falling is getting more gray.
 I&#x27;m removing all Veeam infrastructure servers from the domain in order to get them a little more isolated of the network. I&#x27;ve started with the windows server proxies, as they have less components and I expected to be more easy.
 But, this is where things are getting crazy. When I remove any Windows server from the domain, when it reboots, it gets stuck with the previous user that logged on. If I&#x27;m smart enough to have logged on with the local administrator when removing the machine from the domain, at least I can log in. But if I forget that and use my domain account it get stuck after reboot. There is no option to switch to another user. Even if I log in with the administrator account and try to lock, sign out, switch account, any of that, it just doesn&#x27;t work.
 What am I missing here? Is this the effect of the remains of some GPO of the domain?
 While researching I&#x27;ve come across two policies that could be affecting in that way, but it seems that they&#x27;re not being applied, since the machine is not in the domain anymore.
 Interactive logon: Don&#x27;t display last signed-in &gt; Disabled
 Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers &gt; Not Configured
 I&#x27;ve also tried cleaning the GPOS after leaving the domain, by running: RD /S /Q &quot;%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicyUsers&quot; &amp;&amp; RD /S /Q &quot;%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicy&quot;
 By creating a new Windows Server VM, I can confirm that the normal, non-domain server have the switch user and also lists the local users, if it happens to have more than one.
 I don&#x27;t know what else to check.
 I&#x27;m including screenshots from two servers, one that have leaved the domain, and one fresh install, non-domain. https://imgur.com/a/sS5R6XG

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m currently working as a full stackdev, have been for a little under a year since I graduated. I&#x27;ve worked at both a startup and a corporate position, but I often find myself not enjoying what I do. I have a real hard time caring for what I do, essentially like many other devs I crate software that cuts costs, primarily data entry and data migration. 
 I&#x27;ve found that the biggest satisfaction I get from my work is actually helping people. When people come to me with an error during a UAT demo and I fix it there and then, the recognition from that goes a lot further than me staring at a broken function or a outdated depending for the better part of an hour. 
 I have experience with networking and basic data transfer protocols, but thats as far as it goes. I&#x27;m willing to learn, but don&#x27;t know where to look, what to look for or what jobs can come from this. Any and all information would be appreciated, thank. 
 P.S: should also mention that I&#x27;m based in the UK

                              <span>Turning on the &quot;Try the New Outlook&quot; button in outlook switches to the new version which looks like OWA. 
 It is probably some electron / webapp variant.
 We like most have a lot of business apps and flows integrated with outlook. The new version seems to break plugin compatibility and stuff like signature and contact management seems to be changing too.
 How are handling it?
 Any other thoughts or ideas?

 I see a lot of contract to hire jobs are out there. Are these jobs worth it? It is it better to hold out for another full time gig?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have Server 2008R2 /2012R2 /2016 /2019 /2022, Windows 10/11 clients as domain servers/members.
 Also We have Linux / Unix machines too.
 1 - For only Servers OU , I will apply a GPO like below. Correct ? 
 If we have the following settings:
 Servers: Member servers are in a separate OU (Servers), with a separate GPO (Servers) assigned.
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 OR
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Disabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) &#x3D; Enabled
 Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) &#x3D; Disabled
 2 - Is there any a tool to help admins analyze systems and their connectivity, and network speed, and drive speed, and SMB versions installed and come up with a recommendation for the settings?
 3- Has anyone else run some benchmarks with SMB signing turned on and seen this performance hit?

 Presented by the guy who made the decision to force the TPM requirement. Since it&#x27;s supposed to be Read Only Friday today, I think it&#x27;s a good watch IMO for all WinAdmins. Might not all be implemented in Windows 11 but it&#x27;s their goal.
 A few key things mentioned;
  
Enforcing code signing for apps in Windows by default, with opt-out options. 
 
By default, completely blocking script files (PS1, BAT etc) that were downloaded from the internet and other permission limitations. 
 
App control designed to avoid &#x27;dialogue fatigue&#x27; like what you see with UAC/MacOS. OS will look at what apps the user installs/uses and enable based on that (ie, someone who downloads VS Code, Aida32, Hex Editors etc won&#x27;t have this enabled but someone who just uses Chrome, VPN and other basic things will). Can still be manually enabled.
 
Elaborates on the &#x27;Microsoft Pluton&#x27; project - something that MS will update themselves - implementing this due to how terrible OEM&#x27;s handle TPM standards themselves.
 
Working with major 3rd parties to reduce permission requirements (so that admin isn&#x27;t required to use). MS starting to move towards a memory safe language in the kernel with RUST.
 
Scrapping the idea of building security technologies around the kernel based on users having admin rights, and making users non-admin by default - discusses the challenges involved with this and how they need to migrate many of the win32 tools/settings away from requiring admin rights first before implementing this. Toolkit will be on Github to preview.
 
Explains how they&#x27;re planning to containerise win32 apps (explains MSIX setup files too). Demonstrates with Notepad++
 
Discusses how they&#x27;re planning to target token theft issues with OAuth.

                              <span>There is a great deal of user-generated content out there, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos, but we&#x27;ve generally tried to keep that off of the front page due to the volume and as a result of community feedback. There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!
 In this thread, feel free to show us your pet project, YouTube videos, blog posts, or whatever else you may have and share it with the community. Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, or links that appear to be monetization-grabs will still be removed.

 It&#x27;s a work smarter, not harder kind of request.

                              <span>I really, really didn&#x27;t need this.
 Apparently a while ago I looked up drug laws in Kenya (marijuana is legal in D.C. where I work and my girlfriend is very fond of it) and as a result, an investigation happened without my knowing until yesterday when my equally confused Lead was informed I had to surrender my CAC and tokens, to be taken off base.
 The job was monotonous and not particularly engaging, but I learned a lot while there, and I do not want to resume going back to the Hells of a service desk position.
 I work overseas and am in no hurry to get back to the states. The job I was just terminated from is in AFRICOM near the middle east, does anyone subbed here have recommendations on where to apply? I&#x27;ve applied to positions with Jacobs, Amentum, and Vectrus so far. Ideally I&#x27;d like to move into another OCONUS position, and I&#x27;m trying to keep my head up.
 Side note: I need a beer.
 Additional note: I miss Popeye&#x27;s and Wendy&#x27;s. *sigh*

                              <span>Hi all,
 UPS are trying to send an email which they say is being rejected. There&#x27;s no sign of the messages on a message trace (Exchange Online) which suggest Microsoft are rejecting it before it even reaches us:
  
mx0b-002b8001.pphosted.com rejected your message to the following email addresses:
  
REDACTED
 Your message wasn&#x27;t delivered because the recipient&#x27;s email provider rejected it.
 mx0b-002b8001.pphosted.com gave this error:
 Local Policy Violation
 Here is a message header analysis - https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Tools/EmailHeaders.aspx?huid&#x3D;6c719633-ceeb-42df-86ec-70ebba6834bf
 ​
  
There is a blacklist from one Outlook.com mail server to another but I can&#x27;t imagine Microsoft would reject messages between their own servers?
 SPF is failing which suggests the IP address of the mail server used to send the message (UPS use ProofPoint by the looks of it) is not an approved sender for UPS.com emails.
 DKIM is failing but I think that&#x27;s related to the ARC relay modifying the message headers and not being a trusted ARC sender?
 DMARC is then set to reject messages
  
Is this purely a UPS problem or are we expected to whitelist their ARC sealers to allow the message through?

                              <span>Hi there, like the title suggest, is there a way to restore previous permissions that were removed by a GPO to clear up all users in the Local admin group of a server/computer? One of my colleagues deployed a gpo which ended up clearing all permissions of non domain admin members.

                              <span>Hello,I was wondering if I could ask you opinions?We have a new network, all Cisco, all very nice and shiny, but it is supplied by a third party that, for cost cutting reasons, don&#x27;t have any monitoring in place. (I may have ranted a bit when they cut this part). We are a subset of their network and they don&#x27;t even monitor their own.My question is, how do I best monitor uptime without access to the devices themselves? A consistent and consider approach. 
 We have on prem and cloud servers. We&#x27;ve remote facilities, without servers on, so I could at best ping the gateways on each site.
 Thank you for any insight you can offer.

                              <span>The problem is as follows, Domain Admins are a privileged group in the Active Directory and as a result, the ACL on these accounts is inherited from the AdminSDHolder object in the domain, where inheritance is disabled by default.
 However the option &quot;Include inheritable permissions&quot; is needed for ActiveSync to create necessary containers. Now if I undestand that correctly it is simply not possible, as a Dom-Admin, to receive emails from a mobile device without doing some icky exlusions. What is the best practice solution to this problem?
 Note that our client is running a 2010 On-Prem Exchange server and 2012 DC, and yes our MSP simply doesn&#x27;t have the size to refuse to work on older infrastructure. Also please excuse any problems with the english, not a native speaker.
 EDIT: it seems like some people are saying to just create a new user, is using a shared mailbox for both users (admin and non-admin) THE solution here? Seems sensible to me

                              <span>I have a couple of R740 boxes running 6.7 with the latest updates.
 They were originally installed three or four years back from the Dell custom ESXi ISO.
 I need to get them onto 7 which should be as simple as doing a firmware upgrade via the iDRAC to egt everything up to date then using the latest custom 7 ISO from the Dell website to do a straight upgrade.
 Appreciate random bad things can always happen but high level is anyone aware of any like major red flag issue with upgrading this way to 7 on an R740?
 It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s brand new hardware or ESXi releases.

                              <span>I know the answer will be no, but just wanted to confirm.
 We have interactive BenQ TVs and I want a lag-free streaming solution that also allows for touch input. The Microsoft Wireless 4K is flawless, but I can&#x27;t see any way for a HID input? 
 The other alternative Miracast products are ridiculously expensive (Screenbeams), or have lag that will make using whiteboarding painful (vivi/non-miracast).
 On that note, why is there lag with the BenQ RM03s? Is it the USB wifi dongle or the processor or software? If a better wifi adaptor resolves the issue that&#x27;d be ideal.

                              <span>I need some help here guys, I am working my ass off to cut down on access , between using non interactive service accounts with specific access to Just in time access for local elevation and rotating random admin accounts and password for work stations. 
 We have very little domain admin accounts anymore some are locked down no login service accounts and a few left for admins , 
 I have been working toward delegating access to cut down even more but we’re at the point where if you’re doing domain related functions you either are elevating with that account or using it for certain servers.
 It’s not perfect but considering we had 60+ domain admin accounts down to less then 10 is an improvement.
 But here is my problem 2 of our network admins think they REQUIRE domain admin access to there job and need to be logging in as domain admin on there daily workstation, using a local account with JITA access is to hard and elevating to use DA when doing specific domain tasks is also to hard.. they have network related functions such as DNS , DHCP and some AD functions via delegation but beyond that I don’t think network admin need more then that right? 
 Can someone please give me some sort of good write up on WHY logging in as domain admins on freaking work stations is bad and why it should be a limited and controlled / delegated function… I apparently can’t write up anything that is understandable enough to raise my issues with this and I need help… please !

                              <span>I manage 7 different physical locations. Each location is fairly small. Our main office has about 40 users or less and the other 6 locations have 10 or less users each. We have no internal resources such as servers or anything of that nature, so everything is cloud based. However, if I want to manage something at another site, I have to remote into a computer there. Such as a web interface to appliance, printer, network gear, etc. It would be nice if it were all connected on one network, but it would only benefit me. The only east way I can think to do it is a site to site VPN. Any thoughts? Worthwhile or any other tips?

                              <span>So I was recently hired to handle the IT department of a large concert venue and it&#x27;s payment systems. I don&#x27;t have much experience in this environment but am pretty sure they pulled a quick one. I wasn&#x27;t given much explanation of job duties or my schedule but when I applied it seemed like a seasonal position that would be typically for show days. That position is apparently still open. My position, Technology Supervisor is like 8 hours a day and longer on show days. I&#x27;d currently be making like $38k a year but now I might have to travel somedays into the city with personal vehicle. This is a big jump since now I&#x27;m paying tolls and dealing with city traffic. I&#x27;m going in tomorrow to ask for basically $40k a year to start. Am I in a good spot since I&#x27;ve already started? Tia Ps the venue is huge, seats over 20k people and id be walking to every stand during the dead of summer.

 Netsh will not run at all. Every time we try to run it there is an app crash log generated and the process dies. 
 We only noticed it because of our VPN client wouldn’t add the routes after connection. 
 I’ve tried the sfc scan and all the dism options but nothing seems to fix it.

                              <span>Good afternoon, I&#x27;m looking for a switch to replace an Ubiquiti Edgeswitch 16 XG (It has 12 SFP+ Ports and 4 RJ45 ports) as a core switch something a little more reliable it will be gateway. Our network is pushing at least 1tb in a 24 hour time span. 
 My question: What are some switches with a competing brand that have the same amount of SFP+ ports? As well as some Copper ports. Without insane licensing fees or am I just stuck?
 Thank you in advanced!

                              <span>I am wondering if anyone has had this issue... 
 I currently have a 4 node Hyper-V cluster. I have decommissioned a few servers and removed them from the cluster.
 The issue is that for some reason this has left the .vhdx file behind and stripped the permissions from the file so it can&#x27;t be modified.
 I have tried runing icacls to add the VM SID back on, however everything fails because there are zero permissions on the file.
 Find it weird that the process in Hyper-V cleans up all of the other files but leaves behind the vhdx file, this has happened across a couple of servers now also...

                              <span>Starting around 9:30am CST this morning we started getting a large influx(from ~100 blocked per hour yesterday to 700-900 blocked per hour today) of blocked spam emails on our Barracuda caught using the Spamhaus ZEN feed. Looking at the logs most of it seems like actual spam but some legit emails are getting caught all of a sudden. 
 Is anyone else seeing something similar today?
 Something else that&#x27;s interesting is that over 50% have a source address of mail-{xyz123}.outbound.protection.outlook.com

                              <span>I consider myself especially late to the game with respect to DKIM and DMARC. At my last corporate gig I didn&#x27;t have them set up until around 2021. I don&#x27;t know when I started using SPF but it was probably 2018. 
 One of the services I&#x27;ve been providing since I started freelancing is configuring email authentication for small businesses and a minority of them have it set up. Which I&#x27;d expect...I mean it&#x27;s not usually automatic and they don&#x27;t know they should set it up. I&#x27;m happy to take their money. 
 However, it also seems pretty rare among IT companies I encounter.....even companies purporting to specialize in Cyber security! I&#x27;d estimate a quarter of the IT companies I look at have no DMARC record at all, 25% have a record, but policy isn&#x27;t enforced, and another 25 percent have the policy enforced. 
 So what&#x27;s the deal? Did I miss the memo saying that stuff isn&#x27;t important anymore? Do I just encounter shitty IT companies? Is everyone so busy installing NGAV and EDR systems that they neglect the basic stuff?

                              <span>Has anyone had issues getting an excessive number of blue screens from Dell Inspiron 3505 laptops?
 It seems like our company received a bad batch a little over a year ago, so I was curious about how wide-spread this issue is. We&#x27;re currently sitting at almost 50% of them (that we know of) having daily blue screens, all from the same issue: bad RAM. From my testing, it seems that these laptops are killing the RAM sticks. I ran memtest86 in one of them and it showed a ton of errors. I replaced the RAM, ram memtest86 again which passed all the tests, and then a week later it started having blue screens again and failed memtest.

                              <span>I have a very strange issue with WDS where I now can&#x27;t approve pending devices on a new server that we setup using Server 2022. The previous server was on Server 2016. 
 When I install WDS on the new Server (in Standalone mode, same mode WDS was using under previous set up) I can&#x27;t approve any pending devices and get an &quot;Element not found&quot; error message. 
 WDS settings used: 
 PXE Response: Respond to all client computers (known and unknown) - Require admin approval for unknown computers is ticked. Boot: Known/unknow clients: Continue the PXE boot unless the user presses the ESC key DHCP: Do not listen on DHCP ports - unchecked, Configure DHCP options to indicate that this is also a PXE server - unchecked TFTP: Maximum Block Size: 0, Enable Variable Window Extension - unchecked Rest are as defaults 
 I&#x27;ve found that if I untick &#x27;Require admin approval for unknown computers&#x27; the devices skip the pending stage and will image fine but I need to be able to retain control of which devices can receive an image through PXE. 
 I also have found that I can click the Approve and Name option, give the client I am trying to image a name and run through a wizard without filling in any of the other options and it then works. I found the flat file that contains the approved clients on the old server and every device has a name like &#x27;Domain Admin1&#x27; &#x27;Domain Admin2&#x27; and so on. It&#x27;s not the end of the world to have to do it this way but I&#x27;m still hopeful there is a way to get it to work like I had on the older server where I could simply right click the client and hit approve.
 The new server is domain joined member server only with just the WDS role installed. DHCP remains on a different server. I&#x27;m logged into the new server with admin rights. 
 Just can&#x27;t see what is causing this, any ideas?

 ​
 I don&#x27;t want to place them from A to B but a custom view. When i try to drag folders up and down its possible to do like shown in this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/hojf1vV.png A black bar appears and when i release it it puts the folder there. For the user, the black bar doesn&#x27;t appear and she can&#x27;t move anything up or down, only place folders inside of other folders. 
 ​
 Anyone know how i can fix this?

                              <span>TL;DR - Has anyone else run into employees using low-cost VPN providers and how have you dealt with it?
 We recently implemented a robust security platform and have since discovered that about 10 of our work-from-home users are using low-cost VPN providers to connect to our corporate resources ( We do not have or require a corporate VPN in place for access as all of the resources are publicly web-based). We found that a few of them are choosing to have endpoints in South America and Europe. Despite the increased latency from the VPN and the subsequent latency from the endpoint location they are picking (we are US based), 9 out of 10 of these people aren&#x27;t technical and have no idea why they are using a VPN apart from it making them &quot;safer&quot;. 
 Much like other employers, we now state that employees must have their own reliable internet connection at home, but that&#x27;s where it stops. Keep in mind that these low-cost VPN providers are not being installed on any corporate-owned devices and are either being installed on their personal PC that they are then accessing things like OWA or other web-based resources, or a few that have installed and setup the VPN inside their home firewall and is funneling all traffic from their internal network through the VPN. Please refrain from suggesting to just shut their access off. I am looking for how others have handled this situation and not suggestions on how to screw the users over.
 The real-world impact of the users using these VPN providers is that it affects their performance, sometimes creating &quot;impossible travel&quot; alerts when they switch endpoints, and possible blindspots to security threats (as explained in the next sentence). I am hesitant to create policy exceptions in the security platform as the threat hunters indicated that a lot of real-world bad actors use these VPN providers to help add an extra layer of obfuscation when attacking a target.

                              <span>Greetings everyone, long time lurker and sysadmin for 10+ years here.
 I&#x27;ve been having an SMB connection issue in my evironment for about a month now and I&#x27;m stuck. Essentially I have SMB connections dropping at random. Could be a mapped drive or an open file in excel. 
 Typically to recreate the issue I have a drive mapped to our file share and I work with files on the shares. When the connection drops my mapped drive shows connected but shows no used space indicator. Try opening the drive and it askes for authentication; however, any authentication is met with access denied. If I unmap the drive or in some cases the drive won&#x27;t be mapped but I have notepad++ open with a file from the share it will recover.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried all the typical troubleshooting with SMB. Wireshark shows the access being denied, almost looks as if the client thinks it already is auth&#x27;d but the server sees it as anonymous. Wiresharked both client and server and confirmed they are communicating. Procmon shows nothing useful. SMBClient, server and connectivity logs show absolutely nothing about my user ID even authenticating or anything related to my connection.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried using the DFS share, regular UNC path with hostname and IP and still get access denied. It&#x27;s not tied to one specific client, server or user.
 ​
 Really stuck on this one if anyone has an idea.
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a weird issue, hoping someone can help.
 I&#x27;ve got an issue where mapped drives (to a local networked NAS) get mapped fine, however they will randomly disappear from File Explorer. If I issue a &#x27;net use&#x27; command, the drives are listed in an &#x27;unavailable&#x27; state.
 I can still ping the NAS by both IP and name when the drives aren&#x27;t there, and I can remap them fine, but I am struggling trying to figure out what may be causing this. Sometimes even logging out and back in will cause the drives to disappear.
 I should add, that there is no local domain, the machines are AAD joined.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a bit of a pickle here and could use some advice. I&#x27;ve got an application that requires a physical USB token (a Yubikey) to be plugged into the machine. The application itself is lightweight, running smoothly on less than 1 GB of RAM, and the daily traffic it generates is just a few MB.
 Now, I&#x27;m wondering what my best options are for hosting this application. What type of datacenter services should I be looking into? Should I go for a private setup or consider bare metal?
 I&#x27;ve thought about buying a server, plugging in the USB token, and colocating it in a datacenter. However, that might be a bit of an overkill. So, I&#x27;m hoping to explore alternative solutions before taking that step.
 If any of you know of a datacenter that would be open to accommodating this unique requirement, I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you could let me know. Feel free to reply here or drop me a PM.
 Thanks a ton!

                              <span>Hey everyone, how are you?
 I saw some companies asking candidates to record a video asking screening questions about their profile to understand their profile a little bit better before an interview and I became curious to know your opinion about that.
 Have you ever tried to do something similar? If not, why, and if yes, how were the results? Do you believe it&#x27;s a good thing for the candidate and the interviewer?

                              <span>The only thing holding me back from rolling it out everywhere is that, on systems that are reimaged that are already in an OU where LAPS is applied, the LAPS password breaks the MDT setup because of the changed password. 
 If it resides in an OU where LAPS isn&#x27;t applied, it works fine. 
 I&#x27;ve tried moving the &quot;join domain&quot; to the end, but that hasn&#x27;t worked as anticipated. I have a task in MDT that deploys the VPN, but it has to be on domain before it does that in order to get the necessary certificates. 
 ​
 We are using the LAPS that got released last month. We had the same issue with the old LAPS, but it was decided to handle administrator passwords a different way back then. This year, we planned on going to LAPS, and the new version&#x27;s release just sped up the deployment. It all works perfectly for new builds, but rebuilds it crashes on, and I know there has to be a better way of handling it than just manually moving/deleting the old computer and letting it rebuild. Personally, I&#x27;m fine with that, but help desk isn&#x27;t thrilled, and they&#x27;ll just forget to do it before they deploy, and we&#x27;ll end up with a semi-broken, half-baked system

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered why there are no ADMX editors. Today I had once again a registry key, I could push via GPP, but it might&#x27;ve been much nicer, to create an ADMX for that use-case. So I asked Google and once again I wasn&#x27;t able to find something for that use case. 
 I then thought: Today there&#x27;s a Visual Studio Code extension for almost anything, so of course there will be an ADMX/ADML extension for VSCode. But no, there isn&#x27;t. 
 Am I blind? And if not, does any of you know why there aren&#x27;t tools out there, to create small ADMX/ADML files for us MSP based sysadmins?
 Thanks for some insights!

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 I am looking for a software that will draw a FULL network map:
 ​
  
I list all the Switch and Access points, including: 
 IP
 admin or user credentials
 SNMP data
 
 It should draw a map that includes those switches and all devices (at least mac address) connected to each port of each switch.
  
I tried a few software (the one I&#x27;m testing now is PandoraFMS), but they draw only the switches and APs.

 Any ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on getting a large number of passwords off of a very bad storage mechanism. We have 1Password quite a few users in the company and we&#x27;ve been trialing it with this department and they like it. The only issue we are running into is that we don&#x27;t know how they are going to access these passwords on our POS machines. Each machine has a different AD account, which is shared by whichever user is on the computer. 
 What they are doing now is independently maintaining a shared Chrome account with the passwords saved, but ideally I&#x27;d like if all the passwords could be maintained in one place. 
 Is anyone else using a password manager on shared accounts, and how do you have users authenticate?

 Problem: Some additional Directories on various machines need to be synced to a single server in the VDC. What method is best? Should I use AD DFS Replication, or maybe another utility. 
 All machines are backed up and synced to a different Veeam Repository off-site, restores will take a while, therefore the warm backups.

                              <span>Well, basically the title. We got our hands on a few Igel Thin Clients through a refurbished shop on ebay (not some backyard sale - kind of shop but one with a long history of selling on ebay various kinds of refurbished material). Model M340C to be specific. We plan to use them as emergency backup devices, y&#x27;know? Worst case and that, in case everything goes wrong, you have some old devices in a box that you can pull out and use with a temporary license. 
 However, the devices seems to be still configured with the data from the former owner. Not that there is much to harvest, it&#x27;s set to load a website that&#x27;s not existing anymore and that&#x27;s all. As far as I can tell at least. However I can&#x27;t get into the admin settings to delete the certificate or other settings as it&#x27;s password locked.
 Igel Clients can&#x27;t be reset to factory settings (as far as I know) without involving the Igel support (think of it like the 48 character code for bitlocker locked devices) and that might require some informations of the previous owner, that we don&#x27;t have. I&#x27;m confident that they still may help us however, that would be a bit time consuming to prepare that codes for all the devices and the discussion with them. 
 So I hoped that someone might know a different workaround, if I can access the device on a different way and get rid of the certificate that prevents me from adding it to the managment suite and so on. 
 Also I hope that since the devices are not reset, that the former owner also didn&#x27;t removed the licenses. Since that requires a maintenance subsription with Igel, there is a solid chance the license is still on it and is hardware/MAC bound. A reset would remove that.

                              <span>We have recently started making some software, and we have to give occasional updates for customers for fixes etc.
  
 Currently, 1 person has perms to share from the SP/OD to the customer, but I&#x27;m not a fan because his range is too wide and its development updates. So carries risk + I don&#x27;t like the sharing direct from the SP/OD.
  
 So I want to find a way we can give the updates, and they are customer specific, so they are not the same across customers.
  
 I wondered about using a private file upload site because at least then we can email the customer the link and have it expire in &quot;x&quot; days etc. We would still need to find a way to limit his transfer ability, maybe 1 folder in the SP he can copy the file to that allows upload?
  
 Can anyone give me any ideas, pointers on how you handle this?

                              <span>Anyone else seeing odd taskbar behavior in Win11 (22H2 - Pro)? Disappears, icons are missing, blinks. We’ve seen this with a handful of users out of about 250 users on Win11. Only commonality is Office 2021 Standard and an AS400 terminal program. Swapped laptops, reimaged, and the issues follow. Tried an image via MDT (same image all machines get) and loaded the OS from a USB. I’d really hate to roll them back to 10, but for the sake of their sanity I may need to until we get this figured out.

 I believe this is to limit costs on the analytics software licensing. Obviously this is a major security concern (MFA is not enabled).

                              <span>Good afternoon everyone!
 I tell you my problem and my scenario set up.
 I have a site to site VPN between a Wachtguard Firewall and a Mikrotik Hex Router, connected without problems via IKEv1 in tunnel mode with IPSec in Tunnel mode.
 The ping from the Mikrotik subnet --&gt; towards the Watchguard Firewall subnet is executed correctly with a constant speed of 28 ms without interruptions TTL&#x3D;126
 The problem I have is when I connect via Remote Desktop from the Mikrotik headquarters to the server where the Watchguard Firewall is located.
 The speed is very very slow, and the connection quality is poor. Disconnects from set slow.
 I have tried to configure with IKEv2 in a way with another encryption protocol in PHASE1 and PHASE2 with identical results.
 Also to rule out, I have configured with Firewall Wachguard headquarters A and remote headquarters B and the RDP connection is established correctly and smoothly.
 I have increased the UDP connection tracking time to 20 seconds, but with identical results.
 OS version is 6.49.7
 I&#x27;m new to MIkrotik and I can&#x27;t find any clue that I can solve, thanks!

 Now that WIP WE has been turned off for Windows devices, how can I manage security relating to BYOD devices that don&#x27;t enrol in our MDM. For example contractors that log into office apps from their personal machines. What are the best practices for this scenario? thanks,

                              <span>What&#x27;s a good VPN option for businesses (road warrior) that supports Azure AD authentication (+ MFA)? We&#x27;re currently using the community version of OpenVPN but are planning to phase out our AD setup and only have AAD left (with MFA enforced). While I know that the paid version of OpenVPN can support this, I’m interested in exploring other (more polished) options. We need a network VPN for our employees. A terminal server/VDI environment isn&#x27;t sufficient. Any suggestions (commercial/open-source)? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>We have a problem with Teams on M365 Outlook. The Teams add-in does not appear on the ribbon. If we add it it is greyed out.
 We have not been able to get it to work.
 In M363 admin we see:
 &quot;Multiple users not seeing add-ins in Outlook If you test Outlook add-ins and none show up, as a first troubleshooting step, use the Get-OrganizationConfig PowerShell cmdlet to query the AppsForOfficeEnabled parameter. If the query returns a value of False, set this parameter to True by using the Set-OrganizationConfig cmdlet, so add-ins appear as expected.
 We do not recommend that the AppsForOfficeEnabled parameter is set to False. A value of False overrides all of the above Administrative and User role settings and prevents any new apps from being activated by any user in the organization.
 For more information, see Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/add-ins-for-outlook/specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins#user-roles?WT.mc_id&#x3D;365AdminCSH_SupportCentral&quot;
 We have tried the stuff that is mentioned, and on pages referenced by that page. Can&#x27;t get it to work.
 It does work if the user has admin rights. So either something is not being installed properly, or something is silently getting denied access at run time.
 Does anyone have any ideas please?

                              <span>Hi all, I was wondering if anyone has come across any issues within their laptop fleet in regards to Microsoft Azure VPN client constantly (VPN can disconnect continuously throughout the day).
 From what we seen so far it seems that the disconnect is triggered locally but isn&#x27;t initiated by the users.
 We&#x27;ve tried removing a lot of the dell bloatware (optimiser being the prime suspect) but the same disconnects are still occurring.
 Does anyone have any ideas on why the VPN client would cause constant drops across a fleet of around 150+ with a mix of dell and surface laptops.
 Thanks in advance for anyone for their time.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m happily using Amanda as a backup system with a Spectra Stack library. Everything works well however my setup to optimise at best the tape usage doesn&#x27;t really satisfy me. One step at a time.
 Amanda has a &quot;one tape per run&quot; approach which means that every time &quot;amdump&quot; is run Amanda would use a new tape. The creator had its reasons to design this in such a way and it is mainly for reliability: to spread around the data. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Amanda is pretty clever in planning the backup within the dump cycle nonetheless I end up with a lot of tapes only partially used because of it&#x27;s default approach (and probably my imperfect setup).
 I&#x27;ve solved this issue by using &quot;flush-threshold-dumped&quot; which, as stated in the man pages, &quot;will not begin writing data to a new volume…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks!
 After a year and a half in the helpdesk, a Comptia A+ cert and a CCNA, I finally made the transition I was looking for and became a sysadmin in a new company. It was an incredible move for me, and I was looking forward to taking on more responsibilities and challenging tasks. However, after a few weeks in my new role, I&#x27;m starting to feel a bit disillusioned.
 The main issue is that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually doing much sysadmin work. My days seem to revolve around managing Mosyle MDM and SnipeIT, and apart from that, I find myself with a lot of downtime. I&#x27;ve brought this up with my manager, but they haven&#x27;t given me any additional responsibilities yet. Do not even have AD access.
 Now, I understand that every job has its slow periods, but it feels like hours are passing by with me not really contributing much. It&#x27;s becoming demotivating, and I&#x27;m starting to question whether this is the right company.
 I do enjoy the moments when I get to dive into more technical tasks and troubleshoot complex issues, but those seem to be few and far between.
 I know how challenging is to break out of the helpdesk role so..., fellow sysadmins, I need your advice. Have any of you experienced similar situations early on in your sysadmin career? Is this just a temporary phase, and should I stick it out a bit longer? Or should I start considering other options? Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.
 Note I recently started working from home 2 days a week, which is something I was looking for from long ago. Those days at home, I am basically getting paid without doing anything in 8 hours. Its ridiculous.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Tl;DR: Zabbix 6.0 or Centreon? Need at least monitoring for Windows, Linux, VMware host/vCenter status, server IPMI and Veeam backups.
 I work for an MSP with SMB. I&#x27;ve implemented Zabbix 5.0 as a monitoring services for our clients. Some are directly connected some via zabbix proxy.
 Since mainstream support for Zabbix 5.0 will end this month I am looking at either migrating to 6.0. We need to monitor:
  
Windows and Linux OSs
 VMware hosts/vCenter (with host discoverability)
 IPMI of servers (for hardware issues) 
 Veeam backups (this one is critical)
 Don&#x27;t care about fancy
  
I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution basically by first checking readily available Veeam integration. Found Centreon, but could not find enough recent feedback on reddit. Any thoughts on the product?
 Zabbix is awesome, but not perfect:
  
Not easy to display which customer the host belongs to
 The Veeam integration that we used does not monitor backup copy jobs
 Proxies are annoying to deploy and manage

 I installed EVE-NG on GCP and have access to the URL login page. When entering the credentials for native console or HTML5, nothing happens. No errors or failed login attempts.
 I followed troubleshooting steps here and nothing worked.
  
To fix permission, enter this command in eve-ng console or ssh “/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions”
 Fix eve-ng SQL database using “unl_wrapper -a restoredb” in your eve-ng console or ssh.
 The hard is not full
  
Fix is to use &quot;Admin&quot; not Root when logging in

                              <span>What do other people do?
 I manage 7 different physical locations. Each location is fairly small. Our main office has about 40 users or less and the other 6 locations have 10 or less users each. We have no internal resources such as servers or anything of that nature, so everything is cloud based. However, if I want to manage something at another site, I have to remote into a computer there. Such as a web interface to appliance, printer, network gear, etc. It would be nice if it were all connected on one network, but it would only benefit me. The only east way I can think to do it is a site to site VPN. Any thoughts? Worthwhile or any other tips? I know nothing about SD-WAN but interested in knowing more about it if it would be cost effective? My initial reading is that it’s not for a SMB like us, but I just started reading about it.

                              <span>In my last post I inquired about getting a dedicated 10gig fiber connection for a 40-unit condo in Boston.
 I got great advice and even had people reach out offering their help.
 Ultimately we are leaning towards a 1gb DIA connection and bursting to 10gb. We were able to get this quoted at $900 on 5 year contract with Crown Castle with a /26 for 64 dedicated IPs.
 What we plan to offer is along the lines of: 
  
 100/100 - Included in HOA fee ($8 increase)
  400/400 - $39 add-on
  1000/1000 - $99 add-on
  10,000/10,000 - $299 add-on
  
The reason for this was ultimately to avoid friction from getting it installed in building and wanting to be able to tell units that they can get 100/100 fiber-backed Internet for a $7.50 increase in HOA dues (we are including savings from eliminating Comcas…</span>

                              <span>so I am creating a pcap script using the pcap third party lib in C. I have basic knowledge of the networking such as the TCP/IP model and was looking to apply these skills in a short script that sniffs packets based on pre determined rules such as listen to packets from port 443 and does a DNS lookup based on the source ip to get the domain and displays in a table format. Nothing too fancy because my knowledge of networking past this point is limited. I am using pcap documentation and am using a wireless interface(wlp2s0). The first problem I am receiving is with the pcap_lookupnet which should return network and mask ipv4 addresses such as (192.168.32.4 and 255.255.255.0). When ran the expected returns results are not returned instead the network number returned is 43200 and mask of 16777215. documentation I am following.
 OS - Linux
 Distro - Ubuntu 22.10
  if(pcap_lookupnet(inter4,&amp;net,&amp;mask,err_buffer)&#x3D;&#x3D;-1){ // triggered if lookupnet returns -1 indicating failure printf(&quot;Could not find ipv4 address of sniffing device&quot;); return -1; } printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,net); // returns 43200 ?? what is the significance of this number printf(&quot;%d&quot;,mask); // retuns 16777215 ?? what is the significance of this number

 I also have a similar question with PowerBeam 5 .

                              <span>Hi there. My company are considering moving to a bigger office and discussions have been taking place about ISPs and whether or not we should get a managed ISP router or not. I&#x27;ve never been involved in an office move before so I&#x27;m trying to educate myself. What is meant exactly by a managed ISP router? I thought when a business signs up to an ISP the connection comes with a router that they can connect their firewall into for example. What&#x27;s an alternative setup?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m going to keep my question brief and give as much of an overview as necessary so that you wonderfully smart people can guide me in the direction by way of articles, advice, tips or tricks.
 I am in a pickle. We currently use a vendor who provides us with a service which is awfully useful to us. Without going into incredible detail for the sake of brevity, this service provides us the ability to present our remote cellular routers as existing within the same vnet and from here, we can monitor them with SNMP.
 The reason we do this is because we need to reboot these routers each day, the routers may also be rebooted without warning or reason - and because they are cellular routers, each time they reboot they obtain a new public IP. 
 This, therefore, makes it rather hard to simply probe their WAN interfaces. 
 Anyway, what I need to do is find away to effectively recreate this service as our vendor is doing away with it - gee thanks! 
 I am looking at using an NVA inside of azure - I’m not bothered by the vendor right now, I just need a POC - this NVA will be the VPN headend for our remote routers and I am hoping to present to them a subnet from which we will deploy our sensors to to provide remote monitoring.
 At the moment, I am using a Sonicwall NSv - but I fear I’ve vastly over simplified matters. The testing of my IPsec VPN policy between a remote site and the NVA shows packets coming and going on ports 500, but the ports on 4500 are being dropped somewhere.
 Now this isn’t a tshooting question (I’ve got other posts for that - and yes I’ve enabled NAT-T, IP forwarded on the azure interface, etc etc) 
 What this post is asking is, am I looking at the solution correctly? Is a site to cloud solution the best thing to do? We do not have the ability to use on prem equipment - we don’t have our own core network! - so our needs are pretty much all cloud based.
 Anyway long post over - thank you

                              <span>hello all! looking for some advice on install, i am in canada btw so i won&#x27;t have access to some stuff like meraki go etc
 I will be doing another smb wifi accesspoint install. In the past few years I have done two installs in which both required about 10-20 accesspoints and at that time I went with unifi and till this day everything is working great. So for my next scheduled install I was going to bite the bullet on unifi again but thought i would get some insight on some other brands/products. I did some searching around and seems like for my price range Unifi vs Engenius Fit vs Aruba Instant On is all kinda in the same price range so I guess I am looking to compare that.
 Truth be told, my budget is max the cost of a unifi install, I could slightly raise it if need to but don&#x27;t want to surprass the budget of what a unifi install would cost me.
 Right now for this install I am planning around 30 accesspoints, probably need 1 x 16 port switch + 2 x 8 switches or maybe 4 x 8 port switches + whatever else i need to be able to run captive portal/splashpage and will run whatever router i can find that they provide or is recommended.
 maybe i am old school but tbh uap ac pro have been good enough for me (i really doubt people need more speed) but i guess maybe it is time to make the switch to wifi 6, maybe it will have better range?
 i did some brief searching and my potential unifi build was something like this
 6 x 5 packs of the uap ac pro/nano hd (will buy whatever i can find in 5 pack?)
 udm dream machine or udm pro
 unifi poe switches
 i don&#x27;t think i want to pass a budget of 8000$ cad tbh (this is what a unifi with nano hd 5 pack would hit)
 i know if i went with engenius i would be able to comfortably fit wifi 6 under my budget but not sure if the product is superior. also for aruba instant on seem like they are pricey as well and prob similar to unifi in price range but not sure if they are better etc
 thanks!

                              <span>I am new to Juniper and have a JuniperSRX300 that I am trying to monitor DHCP ACK messages. I know they are being sent because if I go to &quot;show dhcp server statictics&quot; it shows them there. My syslog is only seemingly capturing BOUND messages and RENEW but there should be also ACK&#x27;s in there.
 This is my syslog config:
  syslog { archive size 100k files 3; user * { any emergency; } host 10.210.73.22 { any any; authorization any; match dhcp; port 5014; source-address 10.210.73.1; structured-data; } file messages { any info; authorization info; } file interactive-commands { interactive-commands any; } } tracing destination-override syslog host 10.210.73.22; max-configurations-on-flash 5; max-configuration-rollbacks 5; license { autoupdate { url https://ae1.juniper.net/junos/key_retrieval; } } processes { dhcp-service { log { session { all; } } } } ntp { server us.ntp.pool.org; }

                              <span>Short version: My predecessor signed the company up for pretty meager service with Spectrum and I&#x27;m trying to renegotiate our 3 year contract to get higher throughput at a hopefully lower price. We&#x27;re only 8 months into it so offering to renew the contract doesn&#x27;t get them excited. What other levers are there to get an ISP to up your throughput at the same or lower price? What else could we offer that they care about?
 Long version: We have two fiber circuits through Spectrum - 1g directly from them and a 100m carrier diverse circuit managed by Spectrum but actually provided by some combination of GTT and Frontier. We reach 90% of our capacity up and down at least once a day so I&#x27;d like to get that second connection up to 1g to A) provide more headroom and B) have a viable secondary circuit. If a backhoe finds our sole 1g line, we&#x27;d be in for a lot of hurt trying to run the business on the 100m alone.
 But we&#x27;re only 8 months into our contract. I&#x27;d hoped to get better service at a lower price by renewing (I&#x27;d originally been led to believe we were half way through our contract) but they&#x27;re not interested. Is there anything else I can offer them to sweeten the deal in their eyes? All they&#x27;re offering right now is to increase our throughput on the secondary line with a corresponding cost increase. 
 They&#x27;re also posturing that they resell price they&#x27;ve received from GTT/Frontier is something they have no control over even though the number Spectrum gave me for a 1g Frontier connection is 30% higher than what Frontier quoted me directly.

                              <span>Sorry if topic title is not worded well. I&#x27;ll admit: troubleshooting obscure issues with wireshark is tricky sometimes. My problem is, our workstations are so darn chatty.. at any given slice of time, even during a 1-2 minute pcap, there is usually dozens of tcp sessions, to random microsoft IPs, and other cloud IPs... very difficult to pinpoint exactly what is interesting traffic, if you don&#x27;t know an exact destination hostname or IP address. I&#x27;ve tried doing things like wait until exactly when the minute changes to click the button and then look at the time fields on the frame header to try to match up when stuff happens, but sometimes it&#x27;s just not effective.
 Edit: Feel the need to clarify a bit and defend my ineptitude.. say you are troubleshooting an O365 issue, with something like Outlook.. so you have absolutely no idea what IP the app is talking to because it&#x27;s usually got like 30 TCP sessions out to O365 IPs.

                              <span>Hi,
 I try to configure some shaping on a OPNsense router (virtual) to avoid drops on the next hop, which is located on the WAN interface. 
 Setup:
 [IPerf Server] --- [1 Gbit/s Link]----[LAN - OPNsense Router - WAN] -----[1Gbit/s Link] ------ [Devices with 400M policer]---- [1 Gbit/s Link] ----- [IPerf Server] 
 So I try to upload[1] from first/left IPerf Server, to the other/right IPerf Server but it seems the Device with the 400M policer gets overrun and drops packets.
 So I need to shape all OPNSense outgoing traffic to this device to about 400 Mbit/s.
 Already made some pipe and Rule but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effects.
 Any ideas?
 (Download gets close to 400Mbits)
 Thanks

 Will the latency be increased significantly? What are the other implications?
 Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Greetings, fellow Redditors! We are in the planning phase for a new school site and looking to establish both LAN infrastructure and a video surveillance system.
 It&#x27;s worth noting that the regular network traffic at the new K-12 school site (600 students, 100 staff, 250 Chromebooks, 80 Windows laptops ,couple virtualised Windows Servers, 20 printers, 8 MFC, up to 200 smartphones, PBX with a dozen DECT units only for staffrooms) will primarily consist of internet-bound activities utilizing a 1 Gbps symmetric connection. The majority of data transfers will be directed towards the internet, while a smaller portion will be allocated for local traffic, such as printing tasks and access to a limited number of local resources on the file server, if necessary.
 The proposed video surveillance system will comprise 55 PoE cameras, with each camera potentially requiring up to 10 Mb/s bandwidth to the local recording server (total of 550 Mb/s) and monitoring workstation. As we consider the impact on the LAN, we would appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.
 Switches are planned to be stacked and interconnected in a dozen racks connected to the MDF through 10 Gb/s fiber links.
 I am enclosing a rough rack ports count, which includes a full option (all wall ports connected to switches) and a minimum option (all cables connected to patch panels, but only required ports effectively connected to switches, to lower initial number of required switches).
 https://i.ibb.co/kgKRzzH/Screenshot-6.png
 We are curious about determining if dedicated appliances are necessary to effectively manage the network load. Your expertise and suggestions are highly valued. Thank you!

                              <span>I moved over in to tech sales a few years ago, so I&#x27;m a bit out of the loop for how things are being done these days. Previously companies I worked for always had physically seperated DMZ environments, using different switches than those in their main data center, and having all the VLANs trunked up to a firewall pair for inspection &amp; routing.
 In this day &amp; age though, where VXLAN ovlerays have become popular, and SD-DC solutions like NSX and ACI are in the mix, I&#x27;ve been wondering as to whether or not DMZ environments have physically converged with the rest of the data center.
 What have you guys been observing? Is physical seperation still a common thing?

                              <span>So I saw a few comments about helpdesk tonight that rankled me a little bit, and make me wonder what the technological or managerial solution is for this.
 The long and short of it is, users shouldn&#x27;t share passwords. 100%. Password sharing is bad, security risk, I get it. I also work for an organization that says I can&#x27;t have 30 minutes of an employee&#x27;s time to set up their new computer with them. I have to hand them their computer in a ready-to-go state so that it is a seamless transition from their previous device to their new one. So despite all of our imaging tools, our ability to deploy software from MECM, I still need user credentials for the final hand-off to achieve leadership&#x27;s requirements.

 How long does your company keep these?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve looked it up left and right on google, but I can&#x27;t find a definitive answer... Apologies in advance.
 I need to know what I need to do to give our help desk guys the ability to join computers to the domain and unjoin them as well. When I&#x27;ve researched it, I seem to get a plethora of answers that revolve around modifying domain root permissions, which I&#x27;d not like touch unless I know exactly what is needed. 
 Apparently, their ability to do so existed at some point before I joined in the company, but it broke shortly before I came onboard.
 There is already an AD group that they are all a member of, but from what I&#x27;ve looked at in AD and our GPs, I can&#x27;t find anything that ever tied them to being able to join/remove. For reference, there is already a GPO that makes them local machine admins of computers in our root/&quot;Workstations&quot; OU. Nothing touching the doman root\Computers container. 
 My best guess is that I need to give them write permissions to the Computers container (and our Workstations OU), so that they have the ability to join/remove, but I don&#x27;t know what needs to be done exactly.
 Any input is incredibly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>For some context I&#x27;m 15 years in to a career as a sysadmin in a specialized industry. So I know my strengths and weaknesses, and well aware I have a long stretch ahead of me, and I&#x27;m not looking forward to it. And it&#x27;s not really about the work, but it also kind of is, in what I&#x27;ll be expected to do if I remain in my current role. I&#x27;ve always gone above and beyond learning about the business around me, and I want to follow my interests. In my situation pay would not be an issue, and hiring managers are positive about me in the role, however I&#x27;m just not sure I have all the required knowledge when it comes to things like R and statistics. A lot of us here have some interesting career paths, this can&#x27;t be that unique and frankly I think it&#x27;s a huge asset to have sysadmin knowledge in a data analyst role. Has anyone else gotten out of sysadmin in to a data analyst role or something similar? What did your path look like?

                              <span>My team manages several kiosk type company PCs that are connected to large format printers. They receive updates via SCCM through the Software Center.
 Updates are made available for 2 months and then automatically applied. We desire that our updates be applied at a specific time but sooner than 2 months.
 It&#x27;s just three machines so right now we have a person that goes around, open Software Center, and initiates all of the updates.
 I&#x27;m wondering if it would be possible to run a scheduled task accomplish this?
 (I know the easiest solution would be to modify the deployment SCCM, however our organization works in silos and powers that be have decided that no machines will automatically update for 2 months.)

Sometimes it&#x27;ll BSOD/Lock up entirely needing a forced restart. Logs aren&#x27;t indicating anything is wrong, and when it does, it&#x27;s usually too generic to narrow down. 
 I&#x27;ve escalated to M.S for support but they want log capture the same week/day of the ticket, which is so difficult because these crashes have been so rare / user specific I can&#x27;t capture them at will. 
 I&#x27;ve had a very bad experience with these things...
 What has been your experience with these devices?

                              <span>So, context. 
 I&#x27;m trying to do some professional development, skill up and certify predominantly on VMWare based systems.
 The environment I&#x27;m looking to deploy and test and figure out is large and out of scope of what my business needs, but are where I want to go professionally. They don&#x27;t have a test environment suitable for me to test this nor willing to fund one for me to test VMWare Cloud Foundations which has sizable hardware requirements, etc etc. 
 Now while I do understand there is VMWare HOL but they&#x27;re very instance based and strictly guided on what&#x27;s being taught, not a test lab where I can go start to finish which is where I find I learn best. 
 Outside of buying a Host at home, which where I live is expensive to purchase even a crappy HPE DL G8, are there subscription based services where I can pay for a lab environment to test that&#x27;s strictly for learning purposes? Really trying my best to actually follow in a career that I want to go in but getting super hamstrung with what I have available to me.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m working on a class project that features a theoretical stock trading startup. The focus of our design is on redundancy and latency. If something fails, we need to be switched within under a second. Each tenth of a second costs the company $100,000. 
 I&#x27;ve been searching to try and find a solution that does two things,
 - Streams changes from the live server to the standby server (two VMWare boxes) with little latency.
 - If the live server fails, the standby comes online in under a second.
 I&#x27;m assuming stock trading companies use some sort of specialized software, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any info that might suggest what that is.
 This thing must exist? Any thoughts or suggestion much appreciated.

                              <span>I work as the solo IT person/manager for a SMB (250 employees, 75 PC&#x27;s, 7 different physical locations). They used to outsource their IT to MSP but since hiring me, we are doing away with that. We have some locations that have Sophos firewalls and some that have no firewalls. I want to standardize everything but don&#x27;t particularly want to invest in more Sophos. I don&#x27;t love their product, but don&#x27;t hate it either, just kind of in the middle - unimpressed but it works ok. By the way, I have a good grasp on networking as I&#x27;ve been in the industry 15 years, but I&#x27;m really a jack of all trades and a master of none meaning I&#x27;m not a network engineer so I want something easy to manage. We are lucky to have no on prem servers or anything special, so have a very easy/uncomplicated network topology. Everything is cloud based, SaaS, Azure AD, soft phones, and just desktop PC&#x27;s/laptops and printers. Also no VPN requirement since we don&#x27;t host anything. My requirement is to have something very easy to manage, uncomplicated, yet provide great protection.
 When I replace the Sophos and purchase 7 new firewalls, I&#x27;m looking at the following.
 Palo Alto - Seems to be geared towards enterprise, no doubt one of if not the best in the industry for protection. May be too much to manage 7 of these without network engineer level experience on top of all my other duties?
 Fortinet - Seems to be a great solution, runner up to Palo Alto, maybe cheaper depending on the model. Easier to manage but still plenty of protection?
 Cisco Meraki - Seems to be expensive for what it is, less feature sets, but very easy and reliable. However again we have a simple network so don&#x27;t need many features just something that works. Licensing is a little expensive, and if you don&#x27;t pay up, your firewall stops working.
 So with my requirements and the firewalls I&#x27;m looking at, any recommendations if you were in my shoes?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Not sure if any of you have been impacted by this Cisco Vedge issue. Boy it is creating quite chaos around here. I work for a large bank and we have multiple site complete down. Seems to be a ticking Time bomb! I have linked the article below from Cisco. Seems like all us lower level IT (myself included) will have to go on site to the affected sites and upload a newer cert as Cisco has deemed that to be the best solution at this time. They don&#x27;t seem to have one created yet but hopefully soon.

                              <span>So, working at terribly ran, family owned SMB, and we have a new IS Manager (third one this year, the ran the 1st one off after 17 years and the 2nd guy didn&#x27;t last a day). He&#x27;s pretty good in most respects, but is definitely on the side of the owners of the company when it comes to what he focuses on and how he chooses to resolve things.
 Well, recently, I and the rest of the department- and soon all departments- have been asked to provide all my work account passwords- not vendor accounts, domain admin accounts, server passwords, etc. That&#x27;s all already in a KeePass database that the owners have access too. No, now they want to be able to log in to any account at the company &quot;in case something happens.&quot; In other words- they want us to store every user&#x27;s password where it&#x27;s available for them. Again, the framing is &quot;in case something happens.&quot;
 ​
 Currently- I think they&#x27;re afraid of losing knowledge/access, because they sense they&#x27;ve got 1.5 of my 2 feet out the door already, and the IS Manager/my Jr. Sysadmin are not quite ready to handle everything I do. Or, it could be due to the numerous other major players that have left the company in the past 2-3 years. Either way, it feels like a kneejerk reaction more than someone trying to make sure disaster recovery controls are in place.
 Color me stupid, maybe- but is this not illegal, even if they own the company and thus the accounts?
 At the very least, am I right in feeling like I need to get the fuck out of here before the owner uses my admin account to delete somebody&#x27;s email or something else illegal?

 Basically they pay me max 8hours for one day a week, but management told me I must check tickets daily and send them to someone who can handle since I am not there... is this normal in IT?

I will utilize add&#x27;l resources to find what I am looking for and figured I could start here. The first that comes to mind is KnowBe4, but I have not had time yet to research if they offer a newsletter of some kind to get the job done. Thoughts?? Suggestions?

 I have run across a need to setup a mailing list with external and internal users for communication with our logistics company and another supplier. The problem is, if we manage the Distribution list and It is replied to by an external user on the list, one of the business won&#x27;t receive it if they are running strict filter settings on their mail security system due to it not passing SFP. If we all run different mailing lists it makes for a struggle with keeping associated emails in the same thread when replying and those lists will get out of date and key people may not be properly informed. 
 Say we Have &quot;US Corp&quot;, &quot;Corp A&quot; &amp; &quot;Corp B&quot;
 if the distribution list that everyone uses is managed by &quot;US Corp&quot; ([List@USCorp.com](mailto:List@USCorp.com)) 
 an employee at Corp A sends …</span>

 Problem is this line doesn&#x27;t work
 To set the passwords of all users in the organization so that they expire, use the following cmdlet:

 PowerShell
 ​
 Copy
 Get-MGuser -All | Update-MgUser -PasswordPolicies None -PassThru

 it says the pipeline has been stopped, input object has full value for input object.userID

 Any idea how to is it?

                              <span>Have had a few users over the past week experience Microsoft authentication prompts repeatedly for an hour or so. Today I saw it in real time. Had user reboot and sign out of stuff but still happening. Any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not bashing this guy or anything. I&#x27;m far from a perfect employee and way too new to the job to be a good sysadmin. Its just bizarre and something that I notice a lot. 
 Yesterday, my coworker approached the team with a server &quot;issue&quot; he found on one of our monitoring programs and proposed a potential solution.
 Here&#x27;s the thing:
 I found this issue back in March. Brought it to my team&#x27;s attention, investigated it and documented my findings. Then coordinated with the networking team to discuss resolving it. 
 We found that the &quot;issue&quot; has literally zero impact on performance, and the act of resolving it would require bringing down the server&#x27;s application. And my bosses boss said that he didn&#x27;t think that tradeoff was worth it. Bringing down an important application for several hours to &quot;fix&quot; something that doesn&#x27;t affect the server or the application, whose only impact is a very occasional alert on a monitoring program. 
 The ultimate resolution was to leave it as-is. 
 So I told my coworker that, showed him my work, and forwarded him the email where everyone agreed that it was a non-issue. 
 But apparently that wasn&#x27;t good enough, and he proceeded to bring the application down on his own, with no conferring with the team, against the wishes of everyone else who already worked on the problem, to perform the &quot;fix&quot;. 
 I swear, this guy sometimes just does things for the only reason of creating the appearance that he&#x27;s &quot;fixing&quot; problems that aren&#x27;t actually there.
 We haven&#x27;t had our daily meeting yet so no one has discussed his decision to do this on his own yet. So we&#x27;ll see how that goes. But geez. 
 He otherwise does good work, and I&#x27;m not casting stones because I have my faults too. So I just find it odd that he chooses to do things like this.

                              <span>Hello. I am a total noob for tape backups and am a little lost here. I would appreciate any advice.
 I have been working in tech for a long time and manage a lot of infrastructure, but I have never needed to back something up to tape. Currently I work at a research institute and we have to keep data for a very long time, and we want to fill up a fire safe with a bunch of tapes for this reason.
 My data environment is a mix of offline hard drives, NAS, and some compute clusters.
 My problem is I do not really know what to do here. Dell keep trying to get me to buy massive units that will fill up my racks and store a bunch of tapes inside them as a managed system, but all I need is a way to write to the tapes and then remove the tapes to the safe. I think to this end I can either get an external tape drive, or a small server with a tape drive in it so everyone relevant can access? Am I correct here that I dont need any substantial hardware.
 Secondly they keep asking me about software, what I am going to use to write the tapes for storage. Having looked in to it it seems it is not so simple as drag and drop, and I need a software package to write the data to the tapes. My question here is, does anyone have recommendations for a lightweight software program I can use in an enterprise environment for this? I dont need anything comprehensive just occasional writing to single, unmanaged tapes.
 Apologies if these are silly questions. I have been struggling to find simple directions for what I need to purchase.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins. I am currently serving the the US Marines as a sysamin. I am thinking of transitioning to the civilian sector, kinda done with military lifestyle and want to be with my family. I have reservations for finding a quality salary to match the pay and benefits I have now.
 I&#x27;ve been in the field for about 7 years but realistically, IT only fills like 30-40 of my time at work. Mostly AD user management, vm management, help desk services and network management. I feel like my skill set is too wide and I can&#x27;t command a high salary for a senior sysadmin or project manager.
 If I don&#x27;t transition, I&#x27;ll end up being forced into more personnel management which is not what I want to do. I want to remain technical.
 I just graduated in the fall with a BS in CompSci and have Sec+. Planning on attaining CCNA in a few weeks. 
 I just feel like I don&#x27;t know enough or be competent enough to comfortably transition. Sorry for the ramble, coming to the end of a 24 duty post and I&#x27;m a little tired.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m wondering how many company has moved to Windows 11. I have pressure from my boss to start moving computer to W11 (although not even 25% of my fleet support it and they won&#x27;t replace the computer). They say everyone has moved to it while I&#x27;m seeing only Windows 10 everywhere I look except maybe one or two place. Latest survey I saw online was 20% computers are now on W11, but that include consumer and since they are sold with W11, it&#x27;s normal this number grow.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I hope you&#x27;re all doing well. I recently got a new server for setting up our own virtual environment, moving away from using an MSP and ESXi. We opted for some Dell servers, nothing too fancy since we&#x27;ll only be running about 3 or maybe 4 Windows VMs.
 Here&#x27;s the thing: I&#x27;ve been going through the Dell documentation, trying to understand how to set up BitLocker on this server. I&#x27;ve used BitLocker before on laptops and old servers, where it would prompt for the key or passphrase upon reboot. But now, it seems like because this server has a TPM 2.0 chip, that might not be necessary?
 I&#x27;ve come across conflicting guides and articles from Dell, so I&#x27;m feeling a bit confused. Our server has two drives: one for the OS and another for data storage (a few 2TB drives). When I go to manage BitLocker, I have the option to save the recovery key to a file or print it. So, I saved the key on a USB drive and made additional backups on OneDrive, our NAS, and SaaS backup. For now, I&#x27;ve only enabled BitLocker on the OS drive using the &quot;used space only&quot; option since it&#x27;s currently empty.
 But here&#x27;s the weird part: after rebooting, it didn&#x27;t ask for the key. Many of the guides I&#x27;ve found talk about selecting the TPM module and setting up auto-unlock options, but my server just boots up without any prompts. I&#x27;m assuming that for the second drive, I can simply right-click it and enable BitLocker in the same way.
 Is this normal behavior with a server that has a TPM chip? Does it automatically unlock BitLocker? To be honest, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping for, especially since I plan to move to remote management soon (if it&#x27;s allowed). I want things to be easy during patching nights and remote maintenance.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any insights or clarification on this matter. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I’ve been asked to look at this as an alternative to our Horizon on prem setup.
 I’m a bit dubious about the maintenance of the BYOL offering, but otherwise it looks like it can do the job.
 Does anyone have experience with it for 200 users?

 We got a bad drive in from Seagate fresh out of the box with 5000 bad sectors, sending it back, but when we checked the drive with Seatools I noticed it was reporting 54hrs of use. Is this just their burn-in test time, or may this drive actually have seen use and then been resold by Amazon after a prior return?

                              <span>Hello there, 
 Recently have enforced MFA (we work exclusives with the MS ecosystem and use AWS for our VM&#x27;s ) across the business with some conational access rules set up too. BUT there seems to be a small issue for WFH users.
 There OneDrive/SharePoint sync need to be resigned in every 4 hours ( that&#x27;s the frequency sign in for wfh users) and users keep forgetting and then there work wont sync up with our db. that is integrated with MS cloud storage 
 Yes this is a user issue but I need to make this easier for users, is there a way OneDrive can stay signed in on the users device but ever other app related to MS still needs the MFA input? Is there any addition security risk with this as well?
 Thanks, 
 A fellow lone sysadmin

                              <span>Hi All
 Like others, we were caught out by the CVE-2023-23397 vulnerability and inability to quickly get devices patched. We ended up sending an update command to devices via ConnectWise but walked away from the experience acknowledging the Semi-Annual Channel (and our current configuration) doesn’t get security updates quickly enough. 
 We are keen to get on the Servicing profiles in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin centre but we have some business software that integrates with Office, installing Add-ins and therefor the Software company only support the Semi-annual channel to give them a decent lead time on fixing new Office features - I’m presuming their devs are on the Monthly channel.
 My questions are:
 Is there an intention for MS to bring other channels into servicing profiles? And if so, any ideas on when that will be?
 What is the best strategy on keeping the Semi-Annual Channel safely patched. We are a Hybrid org slowly migrating devices to Intune and we are about to stand-up AutoPatch.
 Thanks!

​
  
Change the registry
  
​
  
Restart the device
  
​
  
Wait 5 minutes and restart the device again
  
​
  Wait at least 5 minutes and the restart the device again Important: An additional restart is required to fully initialize the revocation protections. 
 ​
 what&#x27;s supposed to happen during the 5 minutes?
 ​
 Maybe it needs to be online to retrieve something? Or maybe it&#x27;s to wait for a delayed start service?

 we are currently facing a flood of alert from MDE - did Microsoft maybe change some kind of detection? 
 Is anyone else facing this?

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 Previously on W10 I could see the RSAT tools and run them under my admin account, however, after upgrading to W11, I can no longer see the shortcuts.
 I have checked there installed and if I log on as an admin there exactly where they should be and work just fine.
 ​
 Is there a way to make the shortcuts appear on a non-admin account or am I missing something obvious?
 ​
 ​
 EDIT# I found a solution that works, essentially creating or copying the shortcuts shown to admins will allow non-admin users to run those tools as an admin or other user as usual.
 Shortcuts located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools by default.

                              <span>Anyone seeing issues with launching Edge this morning? We&#x27;ve had a number of users (including myself) with Edge going into not responding when launched. 
 The only workaround I&#x27;ve found so far is to crash Edge and re-launch almost immediately which is fine until you open a new instance of Edge (regular or InPrivate) before it happens again. 
 Appears that users affected are running the same build as those without issues (113.0.1774.35)
 Anyone have any ideas? Been having to install Chrome as a temporary workaround for the time being...

                              <span>Dear all,
 When we try open Outlook from Azure Virtual Desktop, it&#x27;s like we should have the credential pop up appears in the screen but we don&#x27;t have it and finaly we are not able to open Outlook.
 It seems to be a FSLOGIX issue because outlook is opened from multi session VM.
 We are using Hybrid configuration (all computers and servers are Hybrid ADJoin), and we have 2 hosts (vm) fro Azure Virtual Desktop that are in Azure AD Registered(they are synchronize by our AdConnect server). 
 Some advices on my situation?

 Background info:
  
O365/Azure/Microsoft:
  
we have a handful of basic licenses for system email addresses for use in another software application (so that sending from that software comes from a generic address rather than a specific person.
 also have the normal licensed user accounts and email addresses
 currently all are required to do regular password changes, MFA is on.
 
 Other Application: 
 &quot;System Emails&quot; must be configured for ANYONE sending from that software - so, we have both individual accounts in as &#x27;system emails&#x27; as well as the generic &#x27;from the software&#x27; emails.
 I set up app passwords for the generic address emails - but it keeps stopping at the Microsoft password entry screen.
 
 
We have been stuck in a holding pattern - each side is sending me to the other for resolution :) I&#x27;d just like to know if anyone here has had luck recently setting up an App Password and using it somewhere - without actually needing to type a password? 
 OR - any suggestions as to ways to still be &#x27;secure&#x27; but not have the hassle of sharing a password for this generic email (we are really cracking down on how many sticky notes or passwords written on whiteboards). ;) 
 Was thinking separate password policy for those emails with an extremely long character requirement and no expiration?

 Do i need to have other DNS-Records configured, besides the A-Record for the subdomain?

                              <span>So I’ve run into a bit of an issue and it’s raised some questions. It was brought to my attention that one of our facilities’ wifi network had run out of IP addresses. Upon investigation, I found a bunch of MAC addresses that didn’t register to a vendor. I checked the firewall and each address had traffic indicative of an Apple device. (Apple Maps, ICloud, FB, etc). 
 There were roughly 26 different MAC addresses with similar traffic, each reserving a different IP via DHCP. I then checked the wireless controller, and found only 1 iPhone was actively connected. This was during normal working hours. 
 Did this 1 iPhone reserve 26 different IPs? Apple mentions the MAC address changes daily when “Private Wi-Fi Address” is enabled, does it also change when hopping from one access point to another under the same SSID? Did this individual leave a trail of DHCP reservations everywhere he walked in the facility, hopping from AP to AP? 
 Has anybody else dealt with this?

                              <span>Hi there
 We have a new network provider who has sold us business WAN connections in the form of L3 links across their network (inside our own vrf). I need to establish branch-to-DC connections across this provider network. I was wondering if it was worthwhile tunneling (GRE or vxlan?) our traffic across rather than just BGP peering in on both sides and routing through. From a privacy or complexity standpoint is there anything to be gained?
 I know the correct way to do it is most likely is a gateway/VPN/SDWAN type setup but that&#x27;s out of budget for now. What we have is L3 switches at both ends (Aruba CX).
 I&#x27;ve mostly only dealt with dark fibre and L2 provider networks and OSPF routing, just wanted to get opinions before deploying something that might cause headaches later...

 The office has an HP ProCurve 8000 series for core switch and Barracuda firewall.

On the core vlans 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 are configured. The address of the core is 10.1.2.10, each vlan on the core has an IP assigned 10.1.2.10, 10.1.3.1, 10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1. The default gateway on each vlan as defined on the core is 10.1.2.1(port 3 on firewall). DHCP is handled on a server on the 2 subnet 10.1.2.20. The default gateway for e…</span>

 The company that I work for is decommissioning an AnyConnect VPN Portal and as of result I need to remove the soon-to-be legacy portal from the AnyConnect Agent from all end-user. Initially, I thought if I take the existing XML File config and remove the legacy Portal from the Server List. then upload it back into my AnyConnect Configuration in FMC that would remove the portal name as an aviavable option for users to see, however, it still shows up.... Does anyone know how I would go about removing a VPN portal from an AnyConnect Client for all users? Is there something that I am perhaps missing? Do I need to create some form of a XML negate statement?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a difficult time finding an answer to this SR-IOV question.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a hypervisor and create 8 VFs (Virtual Functions) on a 10G NIC, then attach one VF to one VM - 7 VFs are not used.
 Does the total throughput capacity get split up evenly across all VFs - so you would get 1/8 of the total throughput capacity of the NIC per VF, or does one VF have all of the NIC&#x27;s available bandwidth until more VFs are attached to VMs? Does this differ between driver configurations?
 I&#x27;m asking these questions because I saw someone bonding VFs together, and I was wondering if it was because of this or not.
 If anyone knows the answer to this, could you please direct me towards some reading information about it?

                              <span>Hello, thank you for reading. 
 Here&#x27;s the scenario we are dealing with: 
 We have a new building we need to extend our network to. We cannot reach this building with a microwave or fiber, so we purchased a leased line and created an IPsec VPN tunnel from Building A to Remote Building (Building B).
 The end goal of this project is to have Building B fully connected to our network, able to access wireless, fileshares, voip, etc.
 Typically, when we deploy a new building, we simply extend vlans to the building over fiber or microwave. Basically create the Vlan/IRB on the core, and trunk it to where it needs to go. 
 There are a few problems here, one of them being I have no control or say over what is configured on the firewall, and the person who deploys our firewall is old, stubborn, and very hard to work with. That being said, his VPN Tunnel works just not how I need it to.
 Here&#x27;s the other problem: His tunnel provides us with a single LAN. Say 10.10.10.1/24 . We are only able to configure a single VLAN based off this, and the remote location needs roughly 10 VLANs. I have asked him to join me in a call with Cisco to see if we can figure out a solution and he says he doesn&#x27;t have time. 
 So yes I know you cannot help me in dealing with this difficult Person , but I was hoping someone could lend some best practice, tips, or advice. I have a strong feeling there must be a simpler way of extending a network, however my experience is limited.
 If you need any clarity on anything, feel free to ask. Thank you

                              <span>So I have a Draytek 2866 that about 5 people connect to using SSL VPN but one of those five uses Three (UK 5G network) broadband as the person&#x27;s remote and traditional broadband is not an option. Except for that one user, everybody else can connect using SSL VPN and work just fine. For that user, we have IPSec over L2TP setup and that works fine, but we want to move over to SSL VPN completely but the SSL VPN connection on that laptop is dropping packets. We isolated it to be because of the ISP but the funny thing is that the same ISP on the same laptop seems to work with GlobalProtect, PulseSecure &amp; CiscoAnyConnect - all running SSL VPNs so why does the Draytek Smart VPN client not work with SSL?
 I&#x27;ve meddled around with the MTU on both the laptop and the mss value on the draytek but neither of them have made a difference. Appreciate your comments.

                              <span>Hi,
 First of all, here is the CV I&#x27;m looking for advice on.
 I tried posting this on r/ITCareerQuestions but the post just ended up getting downvoted (no idea why) so thought I&#x27;d try my luck here instead.
 So I&#x27;m 33 years old and have been in IT since I was 18. I had a couple of random jobs before that but this is more or less all I&#x27;ve ever known. I started at 1st line (Service Desk) and progressed to 2nd line support, then finally to 3rd line (Network Engineer) in 2017. Most of my time is spent tidying network cabinets, patching cables in at the data centre, installing / replacing customer hardware, carrying out surveys, troubleshooting slowness tickets, etc.
 I enjoy my job but I feel like my time to fly the nest is long overdue - there&#x27;s no chance of promotion anytime soon and I&#x27;m not …</span>

                              <span>Struggling to find simple documentation on the DC site setup for viptela sd-wan redundancy. At a DC site it says both routers need to be on the same site ID which makes sense, what I don&#x27;t get is how are they redundant? Is there no vrrp or BGP peering between the two routers? Is the redundancy purely based on the fact they have the same site ID? And they use the vSmart for redundancy?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a newb to the public IP realm, so forgive my ignorance here. My org bought a IP range and we are trying to set up multihoming BGP with two ISPs. We went into testing, and things just didn&#x27;t work. A significant portion of the internet just wasn&#x27;t available. We could easily reach and resolve from all of the public DNS providers we tried, but basic web browsing was very hit and miss. We rolled back, and upon troubleshooting it was found that another AS is actively advertising our IP range. The name of the org is pretty vague and generic, and I can&#x27;t find anything on them by searching. I am trying to find if there is a public database of AS holders with contact info, kind of like with domain names. Does that exist? What else can we try?

                              <span>It seems like 2005-2010 I was finding chassis switches everywhere. Fast forward to 2023 and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I deployed a new chassis. In the rare event that I do find a chassis, I&#x27;m replacing it with a stack or distribution/aggregation sets. I&#x27;m wondering if this is a midwest thing or if other people are seeing the same thing.

                              <span>1) The question is i’m running some wifi stuff on some dicey electricity so i want to protect it should i be getting a voltage regulator and a ups? Or would a ups be good enough
 2) And if i use them both what is the way to do that plug in the ups and then the voltage regulator or vice verca?
 Also the thing that makes the electricity dicey is it’s go out a lot. Lot’s of fluctuations but also the standard here is 120V and we’re receiving 90V yes i know this is a bigger issue that needs to be fixed
 3) But with the 90V is that enough input for the regulator and ups to work? Or is there a required minimum input 
 4) Also do these devices require the plugs they use to be grounded for them to work or is a hot and neutral good enough? 
 https://www.mercadolibre.com.mx/regulador-de-voltaje-koblenz-rs-1410-1410va-entrada-y-salida-de-120v-negro/p/MLM17328307
 This is the regulator i want to buy, i returned it because it wasn’t working and then realized after it could have been because the voltage was so low or because the plug wasn’t grounded. I hope the link helps with the questions sorry it’s in Spanish.
 Hope someone can help i’m not getting that far with google 👍

                              <span>Yes I understand all the interference and other issues that may arise when on 40MHz and I also understand the recommended non-overlapping channels that should be used are 1, 6, &amp; 11. It&#x27;s my understanding that for 20MHz you must use 1, 6, &amp; 11 because they do not overlap.
 But if I simply want to test out 40MHz for learning purposes, pretty much every link just repeats using 1, 6, &amp; 11 but aren&#x27;t those 20MHz channels?
 My understanding (which may be wrong), that on 802.11n OFDM Channels 3, 9, &amp; 13 are the 40MHz channels.
 I also think I understand that channels 3, 9, and 13 do overlap other channels but that can&#x27;t be avoided since they are 40MHz in width.
 So with all that being said, is it realistic to use, let&#x27;s say channel 9, for testing? To gain some real-world expectations while doing bandwidth tests on that channel. With the assumption that there is weak and extremely limited interference from other wifi signals.
 Right now just in testing the 40MHz channel width does yield more bandwidth than when using 20MHz as expected but I wanted to make sure my test was realistic??
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am trying to get a multipoint layer 2 service to come up between an ASR 920 and an ASR 9006. The ASR 9006 is new to me, I have several 920s and I have no issues with doing MPLS layer 2 circuits between those. I thought I had everything configured correct but I cannot get the l2 virtual circuit to come up.
 ​
 sh mpls l2transport vc Local intf Local circuit Dest address VC ID Status ------------- -------------------------- --------------- ---------- ---------- VFI vc-1 \ vfi 10.0.11.19 1106 DOWN 
 ​
 Here is the configuration for the 920 IOS XE side:
 bridge-domain 1106 l2 vfi vc-1 manual vpn id 1106 bridge-domain 1106 neighbor 10.0.11.19 encapsulation mpls ! 
 ​
 The 9006 IOS XR side:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1/0 description vc-1 transceiver permit pid all l2transport ! ! interface Loopback0 ipv4 address 10.0.11.19 255.255.255.255 ! l2vpn bridge group vc-1 bridge-domain vc-1 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1/0 ! vfi 1106 neighbor 10.0.11.28 pw-id 1106 ! ! routed interface BVI1106 ! ! ! ! mpls ldp log neighbor graceful-restart session-protection ! nsr graceful-restart router-id 10.0.11.19 session protection interface BVI28 ! ! 
 ​
 I am not a MPLS expert by any means but it looks like LDP is working:
 Peer LDP Identifier: 10.0.11.28:0 TCP connection: 10.0.11.28:47083 - 10.0.11.19:646 Graceful Restart: Yes (Reconnect Timeout: 120 sec, Recovery: 0 sec) Session Holdtime: 180 sec State: Oper; Msgs sent/rcvd: 199/198; Downstream-Unsolicited Up time: 00:39:26 
 Both sides of the l2 vc are up and have traffic trying to reach each other. I have no idea where I am going wrong at this point.

                              <span>Hello,
 For those of you who rely on a source of truth (SOT) for network automation, how do you ensure that the SOT remains synchronized with the network? There are various methods to achieve this, and I am interested in discussing different approaches and what has worked well versus what hasn&#x27;t.
 I will be deploying Nautobot soon, and once Nautobot is up and running, my next challenge will be to ensure that it is the actual SOT. We have an operations team who make changes regularly to the devices, so this will be a huge problem.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m replacing a Cisco 7606 as the BGP table is getting full. I don&#x27;t have any fancy things running. Just very simple BGP / OSPF.
 I already purchased a Juniper MX204 for the routing. Now I need to have a switch to get me some additional ports as the MX204 only has just a couple (something that was easy on the Cisco 7600 with blades).
 I&#x27;m going the get the switch as refurbish. I just need port density, 48SFP+ and some additional higher speed QSFP). For now I have narrowed it down to:
  
Juniper QFX5100-48S (or even QFX5110-48S)
 Cisco N3K-C3172PQ-XL
 
 Seem to be almost the same. My question does any of either platform going to give me problems regarding licenses? I will not have any license when I buy these boxes. But would like to be able to software update them if needed (assuming I have the software).
 Any other comments on why to choose one over the other?

                              <span>So far in your experience what is the best fibre internet provider you&#x27;ve used?
 I am using Virgin&#x27;s fake Fibre which give&#x27;s us a Gbit but the router they have given us can&#x27;t port forward and the software fix is 2 months away. This is useless since we have servers internal in which we need to port forward.
 We also have a TalkTalk line which we got installed recently. We changed from a Dynamic to a Static IP yesterday but apparently a range of Static IPs are down for TalkTalk atm.
 Is it me or are UK Internet providers getting more and more flaky. 2 Months for a software fix so I can port forward!!! Is a joke. This is the most basic of tasks that routers have been able to do for decades.
 So while our TalkTalk FTTP line is now getting converted back to a dynamic IP so we can at least use it, since the whole line is down. It will then have to be converted back to a Static IP once the issue is resolved probably causing another 24 hour of down time while the IP gets provisioned.
 What are the best UK 1Gbit/Fibre providers you&#x27;ve used? or are currently using?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am wondering how the server knows who to send packets to. Say a discord server or a facebook server. Does the client need to first specify their ip address in some way to the server so the server knows where to send information? And what if I suddenly use a VPN while on the application, how would the server then know to send packets to that VPN server?

The default timers for OMP graceful restart are 12 hours (can be set to 7 days) and the IPSEC rekey timers are 24 hours by default (can be set to 14 days). The deadline for the data plane to be torn down with the default timers is nearing. Or…</span>

                              <span>In our upcoming school, which is low on budget, we want to offer basic security services to any LAN user, and additionally for students, a web filtering an monitoring facility (keyword catching), which could be served by an appliance such as Smoothwall.
 We&#x27;re wondering if we can save some money avoiding the yearly cost of a NGFW license bundled to our next potential firewall (Sonicwall or Fortigate), since some hardening can be implemented through good policies adoption, for instance, implementing restrictions through VLANs, GPOs (Group Policy Objects), and application executions whitelisting, which are effective ways to enhance network security without relying on expensive NGFW licenses.
 VLANs: VLANs can be used to isolate different types of traffic, such as guest traffic or IoT devices, from the rest of the network. By creating separate VLANs for different types of traffic, network administrators can apply different security policies to each VLAN to restrict access to sensitive resources and prevent lateral movement between VLANs.
 GPOs: Group Policy Objects can be used to enforce security policies on Windows endpoints. GPOs can be used to restrict access to specific applications, block USB devices, disable unnecessary services, and enable advanced security features such as Windows Defender Firewall and BitLocker.
 Application executions whitelisting: Application executions whitelisting is a security practice that allows only trusted applications to run on a system, while blocking all other applications. This can be done by creating a whitelist of approved applications and preventing any other applications from running. This can help to prevent the execution of malicious software and limit the attack surface of the system.
 Adopting this strategy, one could achieve the same effect as using an NGFW license, but with a more targeted tool for the education world at the same cost.
 Your thoughts?

                              <span>Connecting my first SAN, a dual-controller NVME unit. Since I have dual controllers for high availability, was considering redundant switches too. But to extend this thought, I would need dual connections from every server (1 to each switch) for storage at least. 
 Question 1: For those running dual controller SAN, how far do you extend the redundancy on the storage network side? Do you have both controllers plugged into the same switch? Separate switches? Are servers plugged into both switches? What about regular network for the servers--is it senseless to have redundancy on storage network but not for regular LAN traffic for the servers?
 Question 2: How important is it to separate SAN traffic from other network traffic? VLANs sufficient or are separate switches recommended?
 Question 3: I assume using redundant switches effectively reduces my performance potential as it cuts link aggregation potential in half. True? Worth it in your opinion? 
 Thanks

 An Etherflow is a virtual circuit on top of Etherway?
 If someone could provide some more background on this, I&#x27;d be appreciative. Or if you could point me towards a relevant resource. Thank you.

I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it seems that L3 Roaming is somehow interfering with the VPN. The thing is I&#x27;m a little unsure of what L3 Roaming even does. It seems that it makes me able to move between VLANs, which is not something we do at all. We have some different VLANs depending on what the device is (Native, Guest, Sonos, Security Cameras, etc), and we need these to talk together, but not move from one VLAN to another. With these requirements is L3 roaming necessary? All help is much appreciated!

                              <span>There should be an easy solution to this but as I am no network engineer, here we are.
 I have 16 blade servers in a C7000 Bladesystem chassis. Each blade is identical, with two 10gbe NICs each.
 Each blade has one NIC connected to an external network via a 1GBe switch (slow, but only used for the remote desktop). The second nic is connected to the internal private network with no internet uplink. In the C7000, this is implemented as a physical backplane that allows the interconnect between blades - regardless in the OS this is just a second NIC with no internet access.
 Nic 1 is on 10.66.110.xxx connected to the wider network via the switch. Nic2 is on the private internal network 10.0.0.xxx.
 Currently, if I copy a file from server 1 to server 2, it goes over nic 1 and therefore is throttled to 1GBe by the switch. If I connect from server 2 to server 1 via its internal ip address (ie windows file explorer opened to the network location 10.0.0.1 from server 2) then copy a file to a local directory, it still goes over the nic 1 network via the switch.
 I would obviously love to only have file transfer to occur over the direct connection and get the full 10gbe bandwidth. I should note this is windows server 2019.
 Any help would be appreciated!

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the active exploitation of CVE-2023-27350. This vulnerability occurs in certain versions of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF and enables an unauthenticated actor to execute malicious code remotely without credentials. PaperCut released a patch in March 2023.
According to FBI observed information, malicious actors exploited CVE-2023-27350 beginning in mid-April 2023 and continuing through the present.

                              <span>20 year IT vet here, currently cloud engineer. I always strive to keep learning and sharpen skills, but I must admit with the arrival of ChatGPT, Bing AI, upcoming Copilot to name a few I’ve taken a motivation hit to keep learning.
 I planned a few Azure certs this year in addition to going back to school for a bachelors in comp science or cybersecurity.
 My thought is, why should I keep pushing myself if everything is about to be at my fingertips? Also any low skilled person can soon punch in a bunch of prompts and generate required outputs to complete higher level tasks?
 I dont know. I am struggling.

 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name&#x3D;CVE-2023-32233
  
In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled.

                              <span>So I let my boss know in January that I was going to take 8 weeks of paternity leave starting in July. He said no problem and that they would just have to figure out support since I&#x27;m the only tech for my site.
 Fast forward to the last couple weeks. My boss asked if it would be willing to do half the time off and half the time 100 percent remote. I said it wouldn&#x27;t be ideal because It could turn into a lot of me running back into the office so I said I would be willing to help if they were in Jam
 He came back to me this week and said that his boss said absolutely not to working from home and that he expects us to be in the office 5 days a week. 
 Now they are talking about hiring a contractor for when I am out and want me to train them before I leave but the kicker is they want our local operations team to pay for the contrator cost. Which I know they won&#x27;t do because the are on strict hiring freeze. 
 My boss is a very nice guy but this whole situation has made me a little sour. It feels like everytime he talks to me about it you can tell they aren&#x27;t happy about it.
 I stated that 90 percent of our job can be done from home. I just did a whole network and server refresh this year and I stated someone locally should be able to help with troubleshooting over the phone 
 Sorry for the rant. Just don&#x27;t know how to approach this going forward. Considering I&#x27;m entitled to these leave benefits.

                              <span>Worked a couple of years 100% remote, and always produced. Have always produced my whole career. 
 Anyway, we started back in a 3 day per week in office hybrid situation this year. The last couple of months my boss is seemingly micromanaging me as far as &quot;time in seat&quot;. 
 He has commented a couple of times on how I took longer than 15 min on a break or left early (we are talking 10 min once) 
 I&#x27;m on salary I don&#x27;t clock in and out. 
 Just today, I spent 3 hours straight on a call with a colleague fixing a critical issue. After this call, I went to the restroom and then I went 3 min away to the local coffee shop and got a coffee, and then came back. 
 We all get a 15 min break in the morning and one in afternoon. Sure, if you were clock watching I bet it took 20-25 min total this time. But really? This is something that is not really ever cared about, even during this year back, and now just recently it has become a large issue seemingly. 
 Anyone experience this when coming back in or is it a sign that I might be on the way out? My performance has been normal and I always get all projects completed. It just almost seems like they are dealing with something &quot;else&quot; and are pissed off, and trying to take it out on me or something.

I remember running into my first issue that I didn’t know how to fix, to which I thought was a major fuck up at the time and turning towards Reddit and this sub for help. At that moment I was welcomed with hella comments that were filled with both help and encouraging words (and the few negative, but they were outweighed by the positive). Shit, even my name “sadmin” was a play on how down bad I was at the time, most people would think it would stand for “system admin” when in reality I named it that with the “S” standing for “sad” (get it? sad-min, sad admin) haha.
 I say this to say, thank you all for the help and advice over the past year, thanks for every post with every new vulnerability, every comment mentioning a fix to an issue, and even every rant that helped solidify the fact that “it’s not just me” lol. All in all, I love and am grateful for this subreddit!

                              <span>So today I was given some exciting news from the CIO...
 I will be moving from my Sys Admin role to a Systems Architect.
 This has been discussed for a few weeks now on and off since I am primarily working on projects that fall under that title as is, but its nice to finally have the title.
 I don&#x27;t have a lot of people in my life to really spread news like this around, so my fellow redditors and admins alike, I choose to share it with yall and my excitement!
 Time to celebrate with lunch!

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin, I&#x27;m /u/AutoModerator, and welcome to this month&#x27;s Patch Megathread!
 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>It seems like every place I work has me research the monthly costs for Device as a Service (Daas)/Leasing vs. buying laptops outright. Afterwards they always stick with just buying the laptops up front but this time it might be different. 
 Have you ran DaaS? Any big downsides I should be aware of from an IT Head perspective?

                              <span>Does you know anyone that has experiacne with setting up kiosk versions of chrome? I&#x27;m trying to create a small script that asks if the production page needs to be displayed in spanish. I&#x27;ve thrown all the flags I can think off and find, but the page still displays in english. 
 Start-Process -FilePath &quot;C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe&quot; -ArgumentList &quot;--kiosk&quot;, &quot; http://serername/APPLICATION/shopfloor.php?terminal&#x3D;$env:COMPUTERNAME&quot;, &quot;--translate&quot;, &quot;--disable-pinch&quot;, &quot;--overscroll-history-navigation&#x3D;0&quot;, &quot;--translate-service-url&#x3D;https://translate.google.com&quot;
 i have also used other flags as well: &quot;--translate-service-url&#x3D;https://translate.google.com&quot; &quot;--lang-es&quot; &quot;--translate-foreign-language&quot;
 This will be part of a solution to minimize hardware requietments for window 10 based systems. Basically turning them into production kiosks while supressing thnormal windows shell.

 Where does one go to manage the DNS recursive cache?
 The trouble is the delay for discovery of new records that have been added on a site or subdomain for a partner and the time for cache expiration is hard to find or change.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 First post and my native language isn&#x27;t english.
 Since some months we have &quot;problems with cabled(1)&quot; internet &amp; &quot;Wifi(2)&quot; in our enterprise buildings.
  
The problems with cabled internet is solved with disabling Mac Passthrough option in BIOS. Because we use Port replicators that gave issues. (just mentioning this because maybe it helps with the main problem).
 The Wifi problem - Almost no internet at our buildings (250Kbps to 2.5Mbps), when working from home no problem: 
 Only on certain laptops. 
 Working laptop has between 80Mbps-100Mbps
 followed this whole guide: https://www.thetechwire.com/internet-slow-on-one-computer-but-fast-on-another/
 Compared laptop(s) with another laptop and everything is the same(drivers/updates/hardware/... .
 Took the Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 Intern WLAN 2400 Mbit/s from a &quot;working&quot; laptop to a not working laptop. Issue remains.
 Switched the power plan to balanced (i gained 2-3Mbps).
 The Wifi isn&#x27;t REALLY bad at some places. When the faulty laptop connects to AP1 you can have 3.5MBps and when the laptop connects on AP2 it can only have 250Kbps.
 It doesn&#x27;t matter if only 1 laptops is connected to that AP or 10. Issue stays the same.
 We already restarted all the AP&#x27;s(didn&#x27;t replace an AP though).
 When i take a look on our firewall the decibels are for the working and faulty laptop the same.
 We have a Fortinet FortiGate 100F Firewall
 
 
  
-------------
 What i think the problem is: Our firewalls. The problem is that i don&#x27;t know how to pinpoint the cause of the problem. Is there any tool that can push me in the right direction or does someone have some cool tips &amp; tricks?
 ​
 If you have any questions, i&#x27;ll try to anwser them asap.
 Ps: i&#x27;m not an network engineer. I&#x27;m a service desk person.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been quoting up a server today and the price of enterprise SSDs seems to be stuck in a time warp where we&#x27;re still on 2017 SSD prices.
 I&#x27;ve been thinking instead of getting a bare bones HP/Dell server so it can still slot in with the rest of the management environment but putting in our own storage to bring the price down. 
 With this in mind, does anyone sell a PCIE adapter for m.2 drives with some kind of battery backup to protect from sudden power failure? I thought if we paired this up with a couple of third-party enterprise SSD then it would be suitably robust and still come in about 10 grand cheaper.
 Thanks in advance

 We are on top of things most of the time, but we have found this is more due to our sys-admins and engineers being properly paranoid and checking various websites and vendor sites on a daily basis, rather than a proper process.
 So how do you guys do it?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been quite smug about maintaining two SBS 2011 systems since 2012, through all &amp; every weirdo issue they&#x27;ve had. Today I was humbled by a loss of DNS into AD in one of the SBS servers, I was going nowhere, into the wee hours.
 So Chattie &amp; I went for it. 
 Question 17 (still no results) the AI threw up an old Server Fault post along with several others.
 https://serverfault.com/questions/566304/dns-event-id-4000-on-sbs-2011
 Chattie: The command nltest /sc_change_pwd: is used to reset the secure channel password between a domain controller and the domain. 
 The secure channel password is used to encrypt all communications between the domain controller and the domain. 
 If the secure channel password becomes out of sync between the domain controller and the domain, then you may experience problems 
 with Active Directory replication, authentication, and other services that rely on Active Directory.
 ​
 UnNamed Fella: We solved this issue by running the following command on our domain server:
 nltest /sc_change_pwd:
 Afterwards we had to restart the server.
 ​
 Chattie: You should replace  with the fully qualified domain name of the domain controller. 
 For example, if the domain controller’s fully qualified domain name is dc1.contoso.com, 
 then you would run the command nltest /sc_change_pwd:dc1.contoso.com.
 ​
 Me: we were both wrong. Here is the results of two attempts - the last just using the domain:
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib-sbs.tcib.local
 I_NetLogonControl failed: Status &#x3D; 1355 0x54b ERROR_NO_SUCH_DOMAIN
 Better: 
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib.local
 Flags: 0
 Connection Status &#x3D; 0 0x0 NERR_Success
 The command completed successfully.
 nltest. I must get that tattooed somewhere . . .
 So, Guestdc if that&#x27;s your name, I&#x27;ve no idea where you pulled that from, but I owe you.
 Thanks.

Would it be easier to get vcenter and do this? I&#x27;m not sure why they never utilize vcenter before.

Not to mention the time to find, learn, &amp; write these specific scripts (I can&#x27;t find videos or step-by-step tutorials for it). 
 Since help desk job are suppose to be for short-term only, do you think learning to automate is still worth it? Any use of them for sysadmin and network admin?

                              <span>We got a Customer with an RDS Server and Office 2019.
 For a few days now outlook looses its connection to the exchange server and the only thing that helps is repairing the office installation. 
 Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s in safe mode, cache or online mode. Outlook will refuse to load profiles for anyone on that server and sending mails is not possible.
 Office 2019 is up to date.
 The SaRa tool only works with 365 accounts now so that isn&#x27;t really useful anymore.
 The only configuration change that has been done is enabling mapi and clearing the credentials store/logging in again.
 I&#x27;m out of ideas any help?

                              <span>People think that users are the most annoying to sysadmins but they are wrong. Other sysadmins annoy me the most by far. How do you manage the anger when other &quot;sysadmins&quot; do incompetent stuff like assigning a public ip to a windows 2008 server with firewall disabled because &quot;ping didnt work if firewall is enabled&quot;.....and then they wonder why they got hacked...of course i have to cleanup after them and waste hours of my day instead of doing productive things. By the time they get fired i was annoyed so much im loosing brain cells.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I work for a small 40 person company in the financial services sector. I&#x27;ve been tasked with providing cyber security training for our users including a phishing campaign.
 I&#x27;m happy to do this myself with a service like GoFish but I think it would be beneficial to test us all, myself included.
 Been looking at services like KnowBe4 that provide a phishing campaign and cyber security training based on the results of the campaign but am wondering if you guys have any recommendations?
 I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some excellent options out there and some terrible ones!
 Thanks

                              <span>Greetings fellow sysadmins.
 When my organisation started with 365, they used their UK entity to register as that&#x27;s how they were doing things at the time. Now the organisation&#x27;s regulatory focus has shifted to the EU and so legal and compliance want our data residency changed from the UK to an EU location, which is perfectly reasonable.
 You can&#x27;t move this by default, but MS had legacy methods for certain customers meeting certain requirements and has recently (October-ish 2022 I think) provided an add-on named Advanced Data Residency which will allow you to change your data residency, and Microsoft will shift your tenant within 12 months. As long as you meet the geographic and licensing requirements, you can just buy the add-on and request it; no need to be a huge org with an EA with MS…</span>

                              <span>Not looking for identity management and integration with HR etc. I can&#x27;t influence that so i just want to influence the account management side i do control.
 We use powershell now and i dont have the time to further develop it, i want to buy/use a mainstream tool.
  
Automate the Exit process in AD. eg once we set expiry, the tools will find expired/disabled accounts in specific OUs and do things like, hidefromaddressbook, remove from groups, change a field or two, move to a specific OU, after 30 days then delete.
 Find users that are more than 90 days since sign in (interactive or non interactive) in Azure AD and expire them. AD Connect will disable them and #1 will action them. I have PS to do the AAD part, so if a tool can run the PS then great. If it aged AADJ Device accounts too even better.
 Reporting and analysis on user account changes. We use Ad Audit from manage engine, but i dont really like ad manager plus. 
 We have simple account creation system working fine, but anything that was out of the box integrated with sharepoint or m365 forms would be interesting.
 Other really handy account management things i havent mentioned.
  
I like adaxes for Number 1. But what does this well on a small (around 2k AD accounts) scale? I can host, i can present a local web interface to admins and helpdesk via RDS.

                              <span>Hi All,
 So I am working for this huge company from India but I&#x27;m based in Europe. Generally, this is the most unorganized place ever, with nothing working properly, legacy technology everywhere, no docu, no escalation matrix, no access to the tools, toxic people... Just a nightmare to be honest. I am spending half of my day fixing the problems that are caused by the company systems set up in the first place. 
 I am now looking to move forward and I am struggling to find a job which is closer to the business but further away from sysadmin / day to day support. I honestly do not want to do it anymore, I enjoy talking to stakeholders and even explaining tech issues to non-tech colleagues and I&#x27;m good at it. I have good soft skills too.
 Which jobs would be good to apply to?

                              <span>Greetings. I am making this post to seek assistance from fellow system administrators that have come across difficulty at getting a job at one point or another in their careers. 
 I worked as a system administrator in the DoD for several years. I still have a clearance. Recently got out several months ago. I am working through a Cybersecurity degree and I have the following certifications: Network+, Security+, CySA+, Server+, Linux+ and Blue Team Level 1. My experience is quite broad, during my time in I was the head system administrator for a 50+ server network of virtualized Windows and Linux servers. There really isn&#x27;t a single thing I am expert level at. The nature of my job required me to dip my toes in SQL, Cisco, Alcatel, Linux, Windows, fiber repair, Active Directory, Exchange, and many other things. Despite several revisions to my resume as well as professional resume reviews, getting a job post military has been very difficult. I have upskilled in the security analyst side of things, getting a decent handle on digital forensics tools and incident handling and investigation through tools like Splunk. I did this to sort of round out my skills and open up the possibility of going a more cyber focused route. But again I find myself at a point in which my skills and experience are super broad. 
 I have applied to hundreds and hundreds of positions. Only received one interview of which I did really well during. They asked very simple sysadmin related questions about DHCP, Exchange, Active Directory. Baby stuff. Yet two weeks later I was told I didn&#x27;t get it. At this point I decided to specialize and get better at Linux. I am not sure what to do really. I know many are struggling with the job market. It has been absolutely demoralizing and at some point my savings are going to run up. I have even applied to numerous jobs below my skill and experience level with no success. I don&#x27;t know what to do.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Firstly - yes, I&#x27;d prefer to do a fresh VM host installation and move relevant VMs over but that&#x27;s likely not feasible. Secondly, our current environment for background is 4 Hyper-V hosts running Server 2012 R2 with each machine running 2 VMs
 So, has anyone done an in-place upgrade of Server 2012 R2 to Server 2019 of a Hyper-V host that&#x27;s running VMs? I appreciate that the relevant VMs will be down for a period during this (if it works) which I&#x27;m cool with as we&#x27;re a Mon-Fri 9-5 business but I&#x27;m more concerned about any pitfalls or issues that could occur during this that I haven&#x27;t thought of (mainly because I&#x27;ve not done it this way before)
 The plan was to shut down the VMs, disable auto start, throw up the 2019 ISO on the host and just follow the prompts for in-place as though it was a standard server (I&#x27;ve done plenty of in-place on the average server). Is there anything that will stop me from doing this? Anything I need to look out for? Anything that I won&#x27;t be able to recover from that&#x27;ll force me to go a different route?

                              <span>Hi. I am the founder of Netdata, the open-source, real-time performance monitoring and troubleshooting tool.
 Today we released a new version of the open-source Netdata, having our new ML-first approach to monitoring!
 Netdata now automatically trains multiple ML models using k-means for each metric collected, at the edge, right at the place where metrics are collected. At the same time, Netdata runs anomaly detection in real-time, while metrics are being collected, and the result is stored in its database together with metric data.
 There is a long story there, because we also managed to do this without increasing the footprint of the data on disk or in memory, we figured out how to optimize and control the ML training resources consumption even when millions of metrics are collected per …</span>

 I have checked this thread but couldn&#x27;t find anything else that seemed helpful. Currently no backups running and the user I&#x27;m running these commands from is a Domain Admin, so permissions shouldn&#x27;t be a problem either. Also checked the Event Log and couldn&#x27;t find any errors. dcdiag /q also returns nothing. Also checked the firewall-logs and don&#x27;t see any dropped connections between the DCs. 
 Is there anything else I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hello,
 Does anyone have any insight on dealing with Hikari&#x27;s connection pooling feature when an application is connecting to an oracle database and there&#x27;s a FW in-between? Initially our Palo Alto FW was discarding packets because of multiple subsequent SYN packets on the same port coming in &amp; the FW was logging it as &quot;TCP-REUSE&quot; . We applied a zone protection profile to help mitigate that discard/reject behavior but there are still I/O erros in the Application logs and I&#x27;m still seeing some aged-out sessions. I don&#x27;t believe it has to do with the way the firewall is configured and when we applied a custom application with a higher timeout value it made things worse..no asymm routing either as there are tcp-fins.95 percent success rate but still errors

                              <span>I got a weird network issues on my current setup. I suspect this is related to flow control or bufferbloat or something. (I don&#x27;t have too much knowledge on network)
 The network diagram is here: https://pastebin.com/iENaTizD 
 Text diagram:
  
I have one RB5009 router (one SFP+ connected to the switch; one 2.5G connected to 2.5G AP; one 1G connected to 1G AP; one 1G connected to a 1G interface openspeedtest machine)
 One CRS309 switch. (all SFP+)
 2.5G AP (unifi, can go with 2400Mbps Phy speed, 2.5G interface is connected to the router)
 1G AP (unifi, can go with 876Mbps Phy speed, 1G interface is connected to the router)
 Dell server(10G SFP nic, connected to switch, running openspeedtest, pretty sure the openspeedtest server itself can go beyond 5G/5G at least)
 PC (1G nic, connected to router, running openspeedtest.)
  
The problem:
 Devices connecting to those APs (either 2.5G or 1G) will have full upload speed. But their download speed is always half of the upload. I feel that they might have some issues because of mixed interface speeds on the route. If I run speedtest on the 1G PC server, everything is fine.
 In short:
 10G openspeedtest  2.5G/1G AP (half download, correct upload). 1G openspeedtest  2.5G/1G AP (correct download and upload). 10 G openspeedtest  1G PC (correct download and upload) 
 Does anyone know how to solve this issue? Or any ideas on how to debug this? From the results, does that mean the problem exits on those APs? (since the 1G PC can test correctly to 10G openspeedtest)
 Things I have done:
  
I turned on/off all tx/rx flow control. (including flow control settings in unifi controller) They didn&#x27;t help.
 I heard someone mentioned Mikrotik devices have small buffer. And they said there is no solution to 10G&gt;1G cases. (but why my 1G PC doesn&#x27;t have this issue when testing with 10G server?)
 I have a SFP+toRJ45 on the way. I would like to connect the APs directly to the switch to see if it can be fixed.
  
Thanks!

                              <span>In Ben Piper&#x27;s &quot;CCNP Certification Guide&quot; the author says that the only downside to the routed access topology is that it&#x27;s more complex to configure upfront because you have to &quot;allocate two private IP addresses for each point-to-point routed link...[and] you&#x27;ll need to configure a dynamic routing protocol&quot;
 But it seems to me that if you can only have one switch per vlan then you potentially have wasted switchports and need purchase extra switches.
 Also what&#x27;s the point of using vlans at all since the connect routed interfaces separate the broadcast domain anyway?

                              <span>I work for in big tech more or less as a IT support engineer (jack of all trades master of none). I have been looking to make a transition to something more challenging and rewarded and have been messing around with equipment to get at least some hands on knowledge with some networking concepts.
 However I was wondering for folks that do this professionally how often do you get to tinker with hardware in the field? Looking to advance in a field where I can have a nice mix of working on something hands on and software. Would love to hear your personal experiences.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 just out of curiosity; I had a weird requirement to mirror some (L2) traffic to two devices, I didn&#x27;t think that long about it, said sure and then found out that not a single cisco platform in my dc can mirror to two destinations.
 Nexus:
 ERROR: Eth1/10: Only one destination per session 
 ASR920/IOS-XE:
 % Only one Interface can be configured as monitor destination for this session, hence rejecting the entire request configured under this submode 
 ASR9k/IOS-XR:
 just removes the first one added when commiting.
 some whitebox with ipinfusion/ocnos:
 %% ERROR: xe47: Only one destination per session 
 I even tried some huawei switches we had laying around, but also no.
 Funny enough some old Cisco platforms allow that, but I needed three 10G interfaces, so no. Also I can&#x27;t even say if it works but you can at least configure it on a 2960G:
 monitor session 1 destination interface Gi0/7 - 8 
 I then just used a TAP which i luckily had, and that does work fine, but is this request so obscure?
 ​
 I&#x27;m sure I could have worked around that by either spanning to a pseudowire and letting that drop out on two different ports or with ERSPAN or something.
 Am I missing something? Is this just weird and no one would ever need that? Anyone worked around that problem some other way?
 Thanks!

They&#x27;re fine one minute and then all of a sudden fail, and won&#x27;t come back online. All of them have a solid amber light as soon as they&#x27;re powered with no serial output whatsoever.

 Now I have to add some Aruba 6100 CX switches to it, and I just realized that the CX series doesn’t support RSTP. What’s the best (easiest) way to get a config that’s compatible for both ArubaOS types?

                              <span>Looking for a free IPAM with integrated DNS solution for on prem. Looking for the following requriements:
  
Able to keep track of a variety of network data. 
 VLANs
 IPs (ipv4/ipv6)
 VRFs
 Subnets
 
 Supports setting objects as &quot;reserved&quot; but not assigned.
 Supports &quot;grouping&quot; to say &quot;this range of IPs&quot; or &quot;this range of VLANs&quot; 
 Can do ICMP to see if the IPs are still active. 
 Supports integration to a local DNS server. Will build PTR and A/AAAA records as you build IPs. We will then forward requests form our DC&#x27;s to this DNS server.
  
We have tried PHPIPAM. Its ok for what it is but I it has its flaws, and it does not seem like there is much development behind it anymore. Main problem is it does not build A records into the PDNS server while we build entries. 
 Any recommendations?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m facing a weird scenario with a series of Cisco Catalyst 3850, long story short:
 Vlan X, switch A connected to Switch B to Switch C to switch D in a square. STP enabled on the vlan, and each switch is connected to only one other with a trunk with several vlans
 I have one host behind Switch A and one behind Switch C, let&#x27;s call em Ha and Hc respectivelyA-to-D path is blocked on switch D with the port facing switch A in BLK state. Link from B to C is a port channel of 2 members with source mac address hash
 Each switch has a SVI on itself with the same /27 over the vlan X
 If i ping the switches one from each other all is okIf i ping from Ha to Hc i have packet loss (ICMP but also BGP control traffic)
 If i ping from SVI-B to Hc i have 0 packet lossIf i block the A-to-B side with STP port cost, the packet loss vanishes, pinging from Ha to Hc (same for BGP traffic)
 Any idea of what can be the problem? 0 Input errors/CRC on ports.Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 ​
 This might be a bit of a noob question but something I have not done in live environment and we are not big enough to have a lot of test gear and nobody senior has had to do this internally before either. 
 We want to move SVIs from an old Cisco stack of 3750s to new Dell S4048s... I&#x27;ve been trying to test this on an unused vlan but can&#x27;t get the new gateway live on the new stack. 
 Can anyone offer some insight on how to do this safely? There isn&#x27;t much on there except a few legacy VLANs.

                              <span>As for our future school LAN, we&#x27;re lowering the bar since our budget is low :-(
 Our initial goal was sticking with a full Ruckus &amp; Sonicwall solution, however the cost is too high. We&#x27;ve been offered either to: 
  
go for one brand (Ruckus) lowering the number of switches, without connecting all wall ports at once, allowing a gradual growth
 opt for lower quality brands (Cambium), or choose a mixed brand solution. I am hereby listing the alternative offers to a full Ruckus solution

                              <span>We have different sites with wireless lan controllers setup in DNA. DNA is in its infancy in our environment but sites and WLCs and some test access points have been setup in it.
 Using Prime we can currently move access points from one site / controller to another. Dead handy for outages / maintenance etc.
 Prime will shortly be decommissioned and I want to do the same thing in DNA.
 When I try i get a combination of the following error messages : 
 &quot; Warning
 Only buildings with wireless profiles can be assigned for AP location. Location , Floor 2, Server Room does not have a profile &quot; 
 AP(s) cannot be assigned to Site(s) Floor 2 . There are no Wireless Controllers in these site(s).
 There are actually WLCs defined in DNA per location.
 From the above it sounds like i need to create a network profile - and if that&#x27;s the solution that&#x27;s fine 
 The thing is access points get all their settings via WLC profile and we&#x27;re ok with that at the moment - we don&#x27;t need DNA to do this. And don&#x27;t want to jump into DNA wireless profiles just yet - unless we absolutely have to !
 We only want DNA to allow us join an access point(s) to a specific controller.
 Any ideas the easiest way to do this

                              <span>We’re currently in a transition period at my workplace where we are wanting to lab test as many of our changes as possible before deploying to prod. A way we are trying to scale this is by running virtual devices in an emulator (EVE-NG) and using them to test the change. To run the whole network in the lab we’d require ~300 devices running concurrently, which presents its own operational problems (and monetary)as we’re essentially running two production networks at the same time. Has anyone gone about doing this before? What are your thoughts on achieving &gt;90% lab testing for every change? Is this a fools game and we should be targeting network simulation instead i.e. Batfish?

                              <span>We have a subdomain which is connected through a ISP-A in CNAME. Through subdomain, a Program runs in a local server with ISP A. If the ISP-A is down, then program doesn&#x27;t run. So we have added ISP-B through router to local server. If ISP-A is down, Local server will pickup ISP-B. Now the real problem is, We have multiple work places. Both ISP runs perfectly at local station. If ISP-A is up and which is connected to C-Name, then issues for other station client or work from home clients. If ISP-A is down and ISP-B is running(which is not connected to C-name), other station clients or work from home clients unable to open to subdomain or run program, Hence we need to change the CNAME to ISP-B to run locally and other stations.
 We have ubuntu server. Can somebody share a solution or an idea to this issue or do need to hire someone to sort?

 Sometimes you may just need some Linux. 
 Just because no one knows it doesn’t mean you can’t learn it. I’ll even write notes how to restart and so on. Just give it a damn shot!

                              <span>Had a weird issue with 3 users on a single PC (same PC, multiple users use it) when opening a couple very old Access .mdb files. Basically they would open them, print a report from them, close the file, then try and open another .mdb file (there are 4 of these) and they would just get a spinning circle of doom and you would have to open task manager and end the task. 
 These files live on a network drive and I tried several things but nothing seemed to permanetly fix the issue. The odd thing was that on any other PC the files works fine for these same users and they never got the spinning circle of death.
 Well I had talked to them and gave them a work around of going into task manager and finding a second Access task and ending that and then the files opened fine, and I got a verbal confirmation from the users that this was good enough so I stopped working on the issue.
 ​
 Fast forward to today where I get a call from their supervisor pissed that this issue is occuring for them and when is it going to be fixed. Yeah, it&#x27;s my fault for not CYOA, but I recalled at that moment that whenever they had this issue the .accdb access files would open fine no matter what.
 So I opened each .mdb in edit mode where I could see all the forms, macros, tables, etc and I just copied all of them and pasted into a new .accdb file and named it the same thing. From what i could tell everything seemed to be working fine. They were not some crazy complex things, just a few tables, forms, queries, and macros.
 I really won&#x27;t know 100% though until end of week, but that should be fine right? There&#x27;s no weird issue in just copying all the tables, forms, etc from a .mdb into a .accdb right?

                              <span>I went on an interview for a system admin position for a fairly large company. They have around 400 windows servers. During the interview he said that it would be my job to manually login to each server and run updates from the wsus and reboot them over a weekend. He said oh, it only takes around 4 hours. Lol. I asked him why sccm isn’t being used or at least gpos to automate it some and stagger reboots? He said why do you think that is an issue? I said, taking time away from your employees weekends when it can be automated. He said, he wants to make sure all systems are running. I said, that’s what monitoring software is for and alerts. And someone can check in the morning. He didn’t like me asking, and I didn’t care. 
 I didn’t want the job anyways after they said the sole system admin would be helping help desk and desktop support when it’s slow instead of researching and improving the environment. IMHO seems this guy didn’t belong being a director of IT. He’s also the security admin and sys admin. 
 Got the email this morning of them turning me down when they acted all gun hoe about wanting me before I said that. Lol. I got offered a job the day before with the city anyways, which I didn’t accept yet till I went to this job to see what they offered.

 I&#x27;m running up against an insane old school senior sysadmin who insists naming servers nonsense names is good for security because it confuses hackers because they don&#x27;t know what the machine does.
 It&#x27;s an absurd emotional argument. 
 Everyone here knows that financeapp-prod-01 is better to use than morphius, but I need some backing beyond my opinion.

Ever since I also read about people’s phones being hijacked by emails containing Calendar Invites embedded in the email. It just really rubs me the wrong way.

                              <span>Hey folks, I’m wondering what y’all use for appliance PCs if you’re building them. I’ve got a couple of applications that won’t run virtualized, so I’m forced to build PCs for them. 
 These are going to be rack mount machines. It seems like finding a 800+ Watt power supply to fit into a 2RU chassis is becoming a struggle. 
 In the past I’ve used Supermicro server mobo and intel CPU. Don’t need anything fancy for GPU and on board GPU works fine. 
 What parts do y’all like when building machines? Thanks.

                              <span>Ppl from team are dropping like flies and tasks are being thrown to me, and I just put in 65 hours last week. This morning I get berated about a ticketless task that I missed a deadline for, even though it wasn’t on top of the priority. I made it clear this particular task wasn’t at the top of my list since there was no clear deadline. I also am trying to interview and land a new job but I won’t be able to start until my consulting contract wraps up in 3 more months(or pay back this years bonus). If I get fired, it looks bad, if I leave I need to pay them back, I just can’t seem to fucking win. What would you do?
 Update: I walked out today thanks everyone!
 Update 2: kidding aside, thank you all for encouraging words. I am going to set my limits and set up meeting with my manager to get a hold of this situation. As for the unpaid overtime, I will likely speak to an employment lawyer. Thanks again.

                              <span>I could use some advice and have been beating my head on a frustrating issue for a few months now.
 We have an AD domain, DC&#x27;s host DNS (AD-integrated, Secure dynamic updates only), a separate Windows DHCP server (configured to run with a DHCP service account per MS recommendations, set to &#x27;Always Register Dynamic DNS&#x27; for clients), and Windows 10 clients.
 Issue is that our laptops have problems with inconsistent DNS A records - their A record won&#x27;t always update to their latest-assigned IP. They move between on-site LAN, WiFi, and a VPN. It seems that back and forth with the VPN is where they get tripped up the most.
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of reading and testing various setups. I believe it really comes down to who owns, and therefore has the permissions needed to update, the DNS record for th…</span>

                              <span>We have sonicwall vpn for accessing work resources offsite. Its a pretty standard affair but my boss wants to have people who connect to Public Wifi (most commonly would be our salesmen) to have VPN. He wanted me to source another VPN solution like nord/express/ect stating that he doesn&#x27;t think we want them connecting to our vpn just for accessing email. So I have a few questions.
  
How well does a 3rd party vpn play with a work vpn like a sonicwall vpn
 If its just security for when accessing email is 3rd party more secure or would sonicwall be more secure.
 Any vpn recommendations that work well on Apple phones, especially for very non-tech savvy users.

                              <span>Well happy monday everyone, hopefully this issue is localized and not affecting 2012R2 as a whole for those of us unfortunate enough to still be running it.
 Got a call first thing Saturday morning about no internet connectivity at work, so naturally I go in and start taking a look around and come to find out the server hosting our primary DHCP has locked up. It&#x27;s a VM so I just reboot it and now it&#x27;s stuck in a blue screen/reboot loop. Okay whatever, needed an excuse to retire/upgrade that server anyways, and I&#x27;ve got a physical DHCP 2016 server on hot-standby so not too big of an issue.
 Come in this morning and now the issue has spread to our Printing Server and Domain Controller VMs. Print server actually seemed fine with a reboot but the DC got stuck in a boot loop just like DHCP. Also not a big deal since I&#x27;ve got a physical 2022 server that actually serves as the primary DC but still this just seems wild to me that it all happened at once.
 Granted none of this has been a real show-stopper since we&#x27;ve got redundancy but I was just wondering if anyone else had run into 2012R2 suddenly offing itself recently. Or just any other fun monday morning blues.
 I&#x27;ll also update this thread if I figure out anything. Servers seem to be booting when I remove their networking adapters in Hyper-V so that&#x27;s a thing

 -As of the beginning of last week, we have had an absurd amount of tickets come in for &quot;TPM Module Has Malfunctioned&quot;. I am talking hundreds of tickets across our clients.
 -We have not pushed anything out pertaining to TPM, or 365.
 -On all clients, it seems like having them manually sign-out of Office and sign back in fixes the issue, but it is so frequent that this morning, we would usually be at 10 or 15 tickets by this point, we are at 56 with a majority being this TPM error. has anyone else seen this with their clients? I am having trouble finding anything as far as new known issues go for this outside of the tons of articles pertaining to TPM over the last few years.
 ​
 -Has anyone else seen a huge influx of these TPM issues as of the last few weeks?

                              <span>Hello, I am interested in what other orgs are allowing on their Guest Network to WAN firewall rules. We have our guest network segregated by VLAN and it cannot communicated with any other internal networks. However, our Guest to WAN (internet) firewall rule only allows HTTP/HTTPS and a few other web and email related ports. Lately we have had some people complain about certain smart phone apps not working on the guest wifi. After doing some digging I found that some apps require other ports to be allowed in order to fully work. One example is the Sonic Drive-In app, it would not allow you to get to the check out screen. When I did a packet trace it showed port 5671 was blocked. I opened it as a test and now the app works. I have a few other apps with similar connection issues.
 Does anyone just allow Guest to WAN with ANY service allowed? If so, do you consider this safe from a cybersecurity standpoint?

                              <span>This is a bit on the rant side, so please forgive the length.
 Got a client using Barracuda for mail security. All emails from the voicemail service are getting quarantined. Barracuda clearly notes it is an SPF issue, and sure enough when checking it on MXTOOLBOX the SPF record is misconfigured and there are no DKIM or DMARC records associated with that email domain. Client wants to whitelist that address/domain. I hate doing this since hackers always try to spoof email with voicemail subjects, better to do this correctly and safely.
 So I open a ticket and get the VOIP 1st tier, send them the exact error on MXTOOLBOX and tell them to send that to the department that handles your email/dns and correct it. They insist no one else has this issue, and anyway you can just put that address on t…</span>

                              <span>I have 5 new Dell computers I need to get setup for end users. However, the situation is a little unusual so I am looking for advice on what you all would do in this situation. 
 Some important info:
  
The devices are being deployed to a brand-new network (no other end devices)
 We are not using any directory system (AD, Azure, LDAP, etc), and implementing them is out of the question unfortunately. 
 I am aware how annoying this is lol. I have tried to suggest using azure + intune, but was shut down.
 
 I do not have a central server to use, just the 5 devices (one of which is for me to do testing, so really only 4 to deploy to users)
 The devices will eventually need to be CMMC compliant
  
Here is what I need advice on:
  
What is the best way to configure an base image that contains all configuration changes, driver updates, etc? 
 I have looked into NinjaOne RMM, Canonical MaaS, MeshCentral, and MDT. I have used MaaS and MeshCentral before, but most likely these won&#x27;t be approved for me to use. I have never used MDT before and it seems like a lot to get into and I am in somewhat of a time crunch to deploy the machines.
 
 I also will need to get the basic day-to-day applications installed for the users, I&#x27;m not sure if it would be best to bake them into the build, or install them manually on each device after the fact 
 Im new to Windows management, is there a way to install programs with a script? I have heard of chocolatey being similar to Linux package management.
 
  
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting to include something, so I may edit or make a comment. Any help is greatly appreciated.
 Also, in advance to the suggestions to convince my manager to give me some leeway on choosing what tools I use, I have tried and he won&#x27;t budge.

                              <span>Given a list of 2000 public end point hostnames which are responding on port 80, I am looking for a tool that could crunch though them, capture HTTP response code (I made it this far), get the page title, and if the response is a 301 redirect, capture the final URL (to determine whether the redirect was just to an HTTPS endpoint, or whether its redirecting to another site altogether.
 Capturing information about the SSL certificates (if any) would also be helpful (whether their self-signed, issued from our CA, or issued from commercial CA), but not required.
 Ideally this would all be stored in a database so that the same hosts don&#x27;t need to be scanned over and over.
 I started down this rabbit hole with a Laravel app, but once I got to the point of capturing redirects I figured, &quot;you know, maybe this tool already exists&quot;.
 I want a final output that&#x27;s easy to search and summarize.

 Any ideas?

                              <span>I have a room where the cable internet comes in and houses electrical panels and a large transformer. I noticed a puddle of water on the floor the other day. Looks like it came out of a utility conduit (6-8 inch) that comes out of the cement flooring. Looks like they sealed it with foam insulation previously. We had the cable company look but they said there was no signs of water on the outside. The conclusion is there must be some area in the conduit under the foundation that allowed water to seep in. The suggestion was to rip out the foam insulation and re-seal it rather than trenching into the foundation. Though I don&#x27;t feel foam insulation is going to be watertight. I am also concerned about our cable/internet cables just soaking in water long term. 
 Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Do you have any suggestion or should I not be concerned?

                              <span>I have a customer who in their turn have a customer using MAPI for a custom build app that only supports Outlook 2003. They finally allow me to move them to Exchange 2019, but now they find out this app for this Very Important Customer (like, 80% of their revenue) will no longer work because Exchange 2019 is not friends with Outlook 2003. The original dev (from 2000 or so) left that company, so no one wants to touch it.
  
 The compromise management found is that I will set-up a new 2008R2 DC, a domain on its own, with an Exchange 2010, and a new mail domain, to host the single mailbox necessary for Outlook 2003. Like this the customer&#x27;s Exchange can migrate to 2019 and the customer&#x27;s customer can keep using the app until they found someone to re-write the source in ten years or so.
  
 Sigh.

 I wondered if somebody recognized any changes yet after Broadcom took over? So far all the same for me.

                              <span>I am currently working on the development of a password manager application called PassVault for my final year project. As a part of this project, I am seeking stakeholders who can provide valuable insights and suggestions on the development of the PassVault application.
 If you are interested in providing any feedbacks and suggestions to this project, please feel free to share your suggestions and ideas on what features you would like to see in a password manager application. Your input can help shape the direction of this project and contribute to the development of a secure and user-friendly password manager application.
 Here&#x27;s the link for my project documentation so far : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6uGpj1sxA3kbPuIaQBGpm-hIqxpGSP1NvJ1aad8suY/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing
 As part of my project requirement, I cannot proceed to develop PassVault without a stakeholder&#x27;s or a general users opinion and feedback on the features they would like to see in the password manager.

                              <span>I have a Synology RS3621 and it’s 12-bay expansion unit. I got my hands on 12x 22TB WD RED drives to fill the main unit, but the only 22TB drives I can find right now are Seagate. Would it be a problem if I fill the expansion chassis with Seagate drives? I’m going to be making two volumes - one for the main, a one for the expansion - so no volume will contain mixed drives. All will be either WD or Seagate.
 Would love to know anyone’s thoughts, as I don’t think we’ll be getting WDs anytime soon.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi guys, I hope you can help me out with this one. I need a script or tool that detects file changes or deletion in a specific folder and restores the files by deleting the newly created files and copying the original files over from a backup folder. 
 The reason why I need this is because I&#x27;m running a program that keeps deleting two files and creating two new ones with the same name that keep breaking the whole thing and I am tired to keep copying the two old files back and forth. Before I could just mark the two files as read only with the windows tools which kept them untouched, but as of now since a new update of the program it now deletes the files and makes new ones. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Hi All
 We are a Hybrid/Windows/10 M365 E5 org and have a decent SSO experience for users logging into a device for the first time. We direct users to sign into the OneDrive app first, supply MFA and then all office apps are signed in. 
 What isn’t quite working however is Microsoft Edge. When a user opens Edge (after signing into their office apps as above), there is a message to complete the sign-in. 
 “Work – 
 Not Syncing
 We’ve detected this account on your device and we need to verify it before you can complete sign in, and set up sync.” 
 If you click on the “complete Sign in” button, the user is then signed in with no additional prompt or MFA. We are trying to figure out how we can remove the need for the user to click the Complete Sign in button.
 1 GP we are pushing is:
 Browser sign-in settings - Force users to sign-in to use the browser
 Is anyone else experiencing this or have a workaround?
 Thanks!

One of the certs they want me to get is the M365Admin Enterprise Expert certification but I&#x27;m not sure which path to take. Anyone here have this cert? Which path did you take and why?

 What I want of a system is a ChatGPT like system here you ask it a question like, what services is running on SERVER and what special configuration has been done to it?
 Do you guys know a system like this or are you using something similar to this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try not to make this too long, here is the basic recap of the situation:
 I was hired as the first security engineer for a company with around 300 total users. They have absolutely 0 infrastructure or security tools in the environment currently.
  
All windows machines running windows 10 home
 no active directory
 no endpoint protection
 all machines currently have the same login credentials and each user then logs into office 365 and other apps using their own credentials
  
The infra/security team was recently created when the CTO hired a sysadmin (2 months ago), 1 tech support guy, and myself. I didn&#x27;t really receive any sort of training since well there&#x27;s nothing really to train. I asked the CTO for any diagrams or info about the current setup and she gave a single network diagram with switches and 1 gateway (which we can&#x27;t access - it was setup by a third-party and they didn&#x27;t leave a config file or credentials). I decided to try to use the CIS controls as a base point to suggest security improvements. Basically I wrote a proposal with the help of the new sysadmin saying we should get Windows 10/11 Pro, install AD, and use Defender for endpoint protection (this would required upgrading from O365 business standard to O365 business premium). 
 Long story short, the CTO rejected the proposals saying she&#x27;s not convinced that what we proposed will solve the security issues. She said to focus on security policies and to prepare for ISO certification.
 My question is what the fuck do I do here? Has anyone ever had a CTO who either didn&#x27;t know what AD was or was really against its use? Is there any other way to manage machines remotely that is more cost-efficient? Should I just look for a new job that has more reasonable leadership?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Spent some of my weekend helping colleagues coordinate work to fix an issue which essentially bricks machines and forces hands on to fix and the support from Microsoft boiled down to checks we&#x27;d already been through and provided info on numerous times.
 Eventually by the time it was handed over to India they just pointed us to articles we&#x27;d been through already and asked for logs. Then gave us tools which created 20GB+ log files in the span of 15 mins and said they couldn&#x27;t assist us any further so that ended up getting parked. The actual MS &quot;SME&quot; on the call was mediocre next to a helpdesk tech.
 As part of the analysis/fix we accidentally disabled a setting in Group Policy which effectively broke a lot of app services and caused other issues as it stopped the SOE / IE from being able to call out to the internet properly.
 At no point did the MS techs warn us of this and when we spent a day running through everything to figure out the problem and identified it was issues with the SOE using the PAC we sent more logs to Microsoft who literally just said &quot;yes it looks like you have a problem communicating with the internet we should do a log network trace&quot; and it&#x27;s only after handing over to the EMEA support (which nobody communicated to us, we were just sat waiting a few hours) that we got a good way forward. 
 The only time I&#x27;ve seen (Non MSP) vendor support any worse was dealing with Oracle&#x27;s APAC managers and DBA support.

                              <span>Good morning, I have a small problem. I have a cloud server connected to my local network via VPN where an Oracle database is hosted. The problem arises when I try to perform a &quot;select&quot; query, as it gives me a connection error. As a test, I created the exact same machines, one locally and one in the cloud with VPN, and using the same process, the local machine connects successfully, but the machine with VPN does not.
 Do you have any idea what might be causing this issue? 
 If this post violates any of the server rules because it is a very open-ended question or if it&#x27;s a low-quality post, please let me know so I can delete it.

                              <span>you remember? It&#x27;s still a nightmare in our production system where half dozen of computers are still running Win7 and can&#x27;t print because we patched our printserver. Is there some workaround available for the clients which doesn&#x27;t have Win7 ESU with the vulnerability-patch included?

 ​
 I was recently asked to change the default value for msDS-DeletedObjectLifetime from the default 180 days to 90 days in order to meet compliance regulations. I know that this change will make the value for both msDS-DeletedObjectLifetime &amp; TombStoneLifetime different. I would like to check with you experienced folks if there are any implications if I were to do this. Thanks! :)

 I have a local Postfix server for a app that can not authenticate to MS Exchange online. When sending a lot of messages the app gets an error:
 Error: An error occurred with the following error message: &quot;Server not available, closing transmission channel. The server response was: 4.7.0 Too many messages.&quot;.
 Is there a way to set a higher limit for Postfix to accept more messages?

There should be policy A, B and Default Device Compliance Policy. Both A and B is missing and Default Device Compliance Policy shows error at step of DefaultDeviceCompliancePolicy.RequireDeviceCompliancePolicyAssigned. State details says 65001 (Not Applicable).
 Why does device list show this phone as compliant while it isn’t and how to fix Intunes so this kind of situation doesn’t occur again?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m not the youngest on our team by far, and we are getting more and more work working with GitHub, Terraform and Ansible. I need to catch up and feel in the gaps I have to gain confidence.
 I’ve been looking on Udemy and wondered if anyone can recommend a course that ticked the above for you?
 Thanks

 1 parent domain, multiple child domains, all with a transitive trust relationship to the parent domain. I only have administrator rights to one of the child domains, where my users and my workstations are located.
 Users will occasionally sign onto workstations that are located in one of the other domains, and when they do so, none of the user GPOs apply. Is there a way for me to make my group policies apply when signing onto workstations in these other domains?

                              <span>Hello network wizards,
 I&#x27;m in the process of setting up a Fortinet SD-WAN solution in an environment with three interconnected hubs, linked via dark fiber. At the moment, we have a couple of Cisco Nexus 9000s (N9Ks) managing Data Center Interconnection (DCI) at each hub site, all of them running EIGRP. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I can efficiently advertise the DC networks within the SD-WAN fabric. We have 10 remote sites.
  
Is it advisable to stick with EIGRP, or should I explore transitioning to OSPF or BGP in the context of the new SD-WAN setup?
 
Would it be better to overlay the SD-WAN on top of the current network infrastructure or should I consider a more thorough network redesign to better accommodate the SD-WAN?

                              <span>Thought I&#x27;d come to the collective, am I stupid or is DCNM and VXLAN EVPN BGP just a waste of time and trying to resolve a problem that no one said existed. 
 I have started working at a company where they have DCNM deployed by contractors that are no longer there, they replaced the old nexus 5000 with nexus 9000 and DCNM. 
 We have L2 links to all 4 of our DCs in a ring and always will. Also due to the nature of the company, growth will not equal more DCs.
 We have dedicated Internet pipes at each DC, and an active active firewall pair at the two primary of the 4 DCs. 
 I guess I&#x27;m just struggling to find out what the technical reason for deploying DCNM was, did my previous encombant just get caught in the technical weeds and sold on a null issue by the contractors sales team or am I missing something because I truely don&#x27;t see anything special about this DC that couldn&#x27;t be achieved with a strong switching core, HSRP and some basic routing.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t seem to be able to set ospf costs at all with frr - configs seem to be ok, but neighbor says no cost associated.
 Background: Running Anycast DNS and HTTPS, using quagga on RHEL for OSPF high availability across our data centers, successfully. Looking to upgrade RHEL and therefore moving to FRR. Having some issues with that (a later post), but looking to answer a background question first. Network guys want me to continue using OSPF (vs BGP). I&#x27;m a sysadmin, and only a routing noob. 
 I&#x27;ve largely moved our quagga configurations over to frr test systems. However, I noticed that setting OSPF costs for interfaces (lo loopback) seemed to have no effect. In the quagga config (same lo loopback architecture), changing OSPF cost affects routes (as it should). In the frr config, it does not. The router guys can see the cost changes on their route updates when I change quagga configs. They see no route cost changes when I change the frr config. In fact, they have a cost of 0 for ours no matter what I set ours to (10 total, technically, but that includes their default cost for the hop).
 I would expect my configured cost to be picked up by my neighbor, but it is not (for frr). I assume this is a bug, but maybe it&#x27;s different functionality of frr from quagga regarding loopback? If it&#x27;s a feature, does that imply I must move my OSPF service interfaces from lo?
 More details for clarity:
 Frr system: RHEL9 running frr 8.2.2 provided by Red Hat. However, I also tried frr 8.5.1 directly from FRR. &quot;pallando1&quot; is the system name. I&#x27;ll put the config in a comment.
 Happy to provide additional details as requested. Any ideas?

                              <span>Trying to decide which product to purchase. Looking for some clarification between plans.
 Premium+ says it includes 3,100 labs, premium 1,000 labs, and fundamentals is not specified. What are the differences in the labs? Do all three plans include labs in all four areas of Networking, Cyber Security, Data Science, and Cloud, but just less of each area? Or are each of the plans tailored more towards certain areas over others? For example, I am most interested in networking and cloud. Would Premium be the best value? Premium+ seems to include more focus on cyber security, which I would not be utilizing - not right away at least.
 I appreciate any insight. Thanks.

                              <span>I have three sites connected in a ring topology and I am having trouble figuring out how to get EIGRP to put a feasible successor in the topology. If site A wants to reach site B directly then the successor route is in the topology table and routing table. If site A wants to reach site B through site C then the issue is that the RD is equal the AD and it does not get put into the topology table and I am at the mercy of the algorithm rerunning during a link failure. If I try to manipulate values like delay on certain links then it creates a situation where traffic will go a non-optimized path (i.e. site a to site b would travel through site c). 
 Any advice on how this should be done properly? We are looking to move to OSPF but have not dug through the details there to see if it would be any different.

Having some issues with that (a later post), but looking to answer a background question first. Network guys want me to continue using OSPF (vs BGP). I&#x27;m a sysadmin, and only a routing noob.
 Previous config (simplified) used real ethernet (eth0) for the &quot;server&quot; addresses (.150) and loopback (lo) for the &quot;service&quot; (OSPF) addresses (.130):

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve taken on a mammoth task of building new VMware DVS switches on a clients environment and migrated all vm networking over from the previous cisco aci virtual networking backed dvs. 
 I’ve managed to get it all complete but now it’s time to delete the old dvs and I’m struggling to find info on the correct process to do this. Has anyone been through this before? I can see the vswitch in the APIC gui under the virtual networking tab &gt; vmm integration &gt; VMware. Do I delete this or remove the vcenter within to start with? Or do I start by deleting it from vcenter first? 
 My train of thought is this.
  
Maintenance mode a host at a time and delete the vswitch from the host 
 
once all hosts are removed delete the folder in which the dvs is in
 
open apic and remove the vcenter from the vmm integration 
 
delete the vmm object 
 
 I found this kb to build but nothing to remove https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/4-x/virtualization/Cisco-ACI-Virtualization-Guide-42x/Cisco-ACI-Virtualization-Guide-421_chapter_011.html

                              <span>I&#x27;m a novice (&gt;6 months experience) working in a rural area just looking for direction. 
 Here&#x27;s the scenario: An outside company wants to set up a VPN router in my network for access to cameras and wants me to give them a WAN Interface Static IP Address, Subnet, and Gateway info. I mostly understand what each part is individually, but I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing for them. 
 Is this something to be configured in my firewall? Like am I trying to give them an IP address in there and do something with ACLs to allow them access?
 Or do I need another public IP address from my company&#x27;s ISP?
 Do I need more information from them in order to solve the problem?
 I don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m looking for in order to just google it. Thanks for any help given.

                              <span>I set up Radius on a Netgear Prosafe (M7100-24X) and Telnet+Radius works every time. 
 SSH with Radius is not working, and Access-Requests are NOT seen on the Radius server.
 Here is what I think is the relevant CLI:
 ip ssh server enable aaa authentication login &quot;MyDefaultList&quot; radius local aaa authentication enable &quot;MyDefaultEnableList&quot; none radius accounting mode radius server host auth &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; name &quot;RADSERVER&quot; radius server key auth &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; encrypted MyPSK radius server primary &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; radius server host acct &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; name RADSERVER radius server key acct &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; encrypted MyPSK line telnet login authentication MyDefaultList enable authentication MyDefaultEnableList exit line ssh login authentication MyDefaultList enable authentication MyDefaultEnableList password MyLineSSHPassword encrypted exit 
 Through guessing/testing I found that if I enable OR disable Radius Attribute 4, then I will be able to login successfully with SSH+Radius ONE TIME.
 To reiterate: I enable Attribute 4 and input ANY value:
 SSH 1 : radius packets are seen from Wireshark the Radius server, and login is successful
 SSH 2+ : All attempts fail, and no radius packets are seen from Rad server.
 I Disable Attribute 4
 SSH 1 : radius packets are seen from Wireshark the Radius server, and login is successful
 SSH 2+ : All attempts fail, and no radius packets are seen from Rad server.
 Repeatable indefinitely. Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m sending this because I’m pretty sure most of you have faced a similar issue early on in your careers so I’m hoping to get some guidance. 
 How important is it to have interest or passion within Networking Domain. Especially from an ISP pov, where Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, voice services are huge domains in themselves. 
 Is it important to only look at which domain it’s possible to earn the most money, or if a company fixes a domain to focus on, or to choose whichever domain you’re truly passionate about. Need some guidance on this because I’m at a phase in my career where my organization is planning to fix a specific technology on me to focus on.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>We have dell n2048p switches stacked in our office and every time our yealink phones firmware tries to update the switch kills the port about 30-40% through the process. This occurs if we upgrade via Yealinks servers, our VOIP providers servers or locally through the phones https gui, even on the same subnet as the phone to eliminate the firewall. Our normal configuration is to have an access vlan for pcs and a voip vlan on our user ports, which works as intended. In the logs it shows spanning tree killing the port during the upgrade, however, if I turn spanning tree off on the port in behaves the same way. The only way I can get the upgrade to push through is to change the port to just an access vlan and remove the voice vlan. Has anyone else seen this behavior or have an idea of how to fix it? Changing all of our ports to get a firmware upgrade is not ideal.

                              <span>Hello, 
 So I&#x27;m supporting a plant floor with a harsh environment for most &quot;IT&quot; related equipment. Cold in the winter 30-40 F. Hot in the summer 110-120F air quality is also not great weld dust and other things that are not nice to OT equipment. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has found a &quot;good&quot; solution for an environment such as this? I&#x27;ve ran Cisco, Fortinets, Adtran, few things they all will eventually suffer early failure. 1-3 year life expectancy. 
 Is there a better option? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I am trying to add a VLAN onto a trunk and it keeps appending the native VLAN onto the list change the number. 
 In Trunk mode, currently my native vlan is set to 13 and I have Vlan 50 tagged. I am trying to add VLAN 17 so I type in 17,50. When I hit save it changes the list of tagged VLANs to 50,1317. I can&#x27;t seem to change to this 17, 50. What am I doing it wrong here?

                              <span>I overheard a network engineer vendor we work with describe a proposed topology I didn&#x27;t quite understand. Two distinct networks each with their own respective VLANs would be connected by L3 switches across an MPLS link using only SVIs, so something like a /30 only between the edge switches like so is what I&#x27;m presuming. I tried to do this in PacketTracer but couldn&#x27;t get it to work, so I assume I&#x27;m missing something:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 description SITE2_EDGE_SW-SITE1_EDGE_SW switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 100 ! interface Vlan100 description SITE2_EDGE_SW ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.252 ! interface Vlan10 description PC_VLAN ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0 
 Is it possible to simply route traffic from SITE2 that is destined for VLANS at SITE1 across an SVI like this? Normally I would have done this using a non switchport physical interface that I assigned a /30 ip address to Gi0/1 instead of doing it across L2 trunk, but I could easily be missing something obvious. 
 Is it possible to route traffic from, say, the PC_VLAN in SITE2 on 10.0.10.0 out through Gi0/1 to a SITE1 VLAN on a different subnet like 10.0.100.0 using a L2 trunk?

                              <span>Currently facing a task which looks (and is) extremely simple but I&#x27;m clearly missing out on something.
 Basically I need to filter out of the BGP process *all* the networks with a prefix larger than /24. In the Cisco lab it&#x27;s done by prefix-set and route-policy statements, and the logic is the same.
 I wrote these two lines:
 ip ip-prefix invalid-prefixes index 10 permit 0.0.0.0 0 match-network greater-equal 25 less-equal 32 route-policy test-block-invalid deny node 10 if-match ip-prefix invalid-prefixes 
 then I applied the route-policy to a single peer in the BGP configuration, so again pretty simple:
 bgp XXXXX ipv4-family unicast peer peer-name route-policy test-block-invalid import 
 but when I checked via display bgp routing-table I found that everything from that peer had been filtered out, including the default route.
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thank you

                              <span>I have over 11 years of traditional networking experience (LAN, routing protocols, routers, switches etc.) and have recently switched to telecom networking. Now I am handling cloud-native, 5G, NFV, virtualization, RAN, accelerated cards, K8s etc. I have always liked learning, troubleshooting/creating labs on GNS so learning new stuff isn&#x27;t a problem for me however I am overwhelmed as in where to start from. 10 years of experience seems more like a problem than a help since that level of understanding is expected out of me. Also, seems like we don&#x27;t have as much material (at least structured, IMO) as on traditional networking specially from/on Cisco (which is where I have had major experience in).
 Any recommendations on how make the transition or any resources? I am looking to make a structured plan and go for it. Any sort of career guidance? I would love to connect with someone who has worked in both or is currently working in telco networking.
 I have had people telling me I am insane to come to telecom from traditional networking since there is more scope in the latter which sets me back and messes with my already struggling mind.
 Lastly, this is my 1st post on reddit (which was removed twice, I have no idea why), if I have made some mistakes or not obliged to any rules , please be easy on me.
 Also, would love to connect with people working in Telecom networking. DM me.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am in a process of changing jobs and I am at a crossroad. I wanted to asked you for an opinion, which would you pick and why.
 I have an offer for a mid-level Network Engineer position in the Engineering department at a Investment Bank working with Prisma Palo Alto, Infoblox, migrating infrastructure to Azure and working with Ansible, etc.
 Another option would be SRE in Operations team at a Cloud Company who focuses on multiple cloud solutions but the job would primarily focus on Azure stuff working with Terraform, ARM, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Cloudformation.
 I don&#x27;t want to make my decision with salary or other benefits in mind but want to figure out what would be best for my growth and my career.
 I figure that SRE is more desirable but I am not sure how valuable is working in operations team as supposed to an engineering team.

                              <span>SUMMARY
The Snake implant is considered the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool designed and used by Center 16 of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive targets. To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB’s ultimate targets. Snake’s custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.
We have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australi…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I am 44F. Prior to accident and then pregnancy, I worked for a company that provided ISP (business line) and everything - from my ergonomic desk, chair, three 32&quot; monitors, printers, shredder, VOIP phone. etc. It was an American company and my partner stayed behind and I ended up leaving due to maternity.
 After COVID, leaving the company, pregnancy, moving house and having a new job as well as being classed as disabled by my GP, I was wondering, what people&#x27;s set up are like now. I used to work in the NOC and use Linux as my main laptop, I used to have a sit/stand desk and this is replicated at home, except for the monitor setup. I only have that 3x 32&quot; laptop. Apologies if I am using the wrong terms here as I have had spent 2020-2022 mostly in hospital due to sepsis. I have this special chair/monitor. I am currently just returning to work so quite unsure how my setup at home will be.
 Disabled or not, will you mind sharing your current desk setup to me? I live in the UK and have applied to Access to Work. They have a 5 month waiting time. Regardless of how long it is, I would like to make sure I have ask for the appropriate things and not go over the top. I am wheelchair bound and you can find some of my medical issues here https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/134aah7/is_oral_surgery_the_only_recourse_is_there_any/
 Thank you in advance for all your help.

 Has anyone figurd this out. IT worked great with Windows 10. 
 Is the key to join Azure and connect AD to Azure and have the bitlocker keys stored there vs. in AD?

                              <span>Wondering if anybody has cracked the task that is far more difficult than it should be and found a decent script to correctly display dormant accounts in a 365 tenancy in order to save on licences. We have found a way pulling multiple different reports using a 3rd party tool and trying to automate that with little success so far.
 Trying to be pre-emptive here only, but simply pulling &quot;inactive accounts&quot; like most posts suggest in Azure AD pulls erroneous data, only way we have found is to compare activity reports from multiple sources which is time consuming and harder then it should be.

                              <span>For those of you that have a pretty thorough understanding and access to your environments, how does your OS breakdown for your servers?
 Give rough total amount of servers (primarily virtual, but could be physical too; not including networking equipment like switches/routers/etc), and the breakdown of Windows or Linux or Unix or other.
 If you’re willing to provide the Industry you’re in that would be cool too. 
 I’m just curious as I browse LinkedIn jobs periodically to see what technologies companies use and thought what better forum to post on

                              <span>Hi so dumb question since I guess my knowledgeable wasn’t on par on this
 Situation customer have on premise AD with azure ad connect and a tenant
 We enabled password write back and tested with SSPR and all works
 Most users are uses their synced UPN but doesn’t go on the local AD as their devices are hybrid ad joined, so they are mostly on azure.
 Since their account are sync from in premise when I check either password must be changed at next logon or change the default domain policy to expire after 10 days, no one on azure had been forced to changed their password and their outlook connection never expired
 Is it because the password expire only works on the local ad and not on azure ad?
 Thanks

                              <span>We have this annoying problem. A user signs into their Adobe account using Adobe Reader, which makes Adobe Reader unusable. What happens is that upon launching Adobe Reader, it will continually pop up with Certificate errors and they&#x27;re impossible to click out of. I&#x27;ve tried to sign out, but I get an error in doing so.
 Several months ago, I was able to rid of the error by uninstalling Adobe Reader (64-bit), installing the 32-bit version, then uninstalling that and re-installing the 64-bit version. In doing so, I also cleaned all of the suggested folders.
 Just looking for a quicker way. Does such exist? Are there Group Policies for this which don&#x27;t allow saving user sign-in information?

We are putting together a run book at the org I work for, and I am contemplating how to document our backup strategies. I can certainly write it out, but I also like to make some sort of visual for things like this. 
 Resources we are backing up:
 Wordpress Sites (x16)
 Salesforce (x155 users)
 M365 (50 SharePoint Sites, 100 users, and a handful of shared mailboxes)
 File Server (Synology NAS w/ a few legacy stores)
 ​
 Templates or suggestions much appreciated.

                              <span>Starting to work through benefits and events for my department for the next fiscal period, I&#x27;m curious what are some of the unique benefits other companies offer.
 Last year, I gave all engineering and up a pilot run of the unlimited PTO benefit. This year we made it permanent after both my team satisfaction and organizational IT satisfaction skyrocketed. Most averaged 4 1/2 weeks of PTO, 1 took only a day off and another took 7 weeks off for his son&#x27;s birth.
 Organizationally, we don&#x27;t do WFH but the policy I&#x27;ve with my team is, so long as they are not missing meetings and hitting their deadlines, I don&#x27;t care if they take a day or two during the week to work from home.
 Taking a note from my military experiences and what i saw at another company, I&#x27;ve got approval this year to implement automatic career promotions through a combination of tenure and requiring certifications common at for someone in that role.
 So, what are compelling benefits and events that motivate you?

                              <span>I have been a Sysadmin for a while now. But with every job I’ve had I have ran into weeks of coding new websites with DB queries and using python and just overall programming a lot. A friend of mine offered me a job with a 20% raise to learn on the job and get to work alongside him. 
 I learn quickly on almost anything I do being 24 I have went to from MSP 20% raise-&gt; Regional SysAdmin 40% raise within 3 years. now this programming job seems to be right up my alley. I’m good with the workflow and would never have to touch a printer again! Haha. 
 If you were in my shoes would you do?
 I’m also trying to think of longevity for the career itself. Will sysadmins always be needed once everything moves to cloud or before MSP’s wipe out the lower level items. I’m just not to far versed in whether the career itself is better for the long run. 
 Any ideas would help.

                              <span>One of my sysadmins has been helping to cover while the desktop team is short handed, and this really annoying user who is an angry middle aged woman who got pissed that he moved her cheese and is basically helping do upgrades away from an old system she likes.
 So she accused him of sexual harassment and escalated this. He did not sexually harass her. I know this for multiple reasons. He would never do this because he&#x27;s ultra professional and I doubt he even talked to her about anything other than work.
 But beyond this, he is actually extremely gay (and very guarded about it). He isn&#x27;t into women. At all.
 So she is full of shit.
 This is the sort of bullshit I have to deal with in IT management.
 edit: are people here too young to get the moved my cheese phrase? its a book, a horrible book, google it

 I miss my old IT career of 24 years.
 I don&#x27;t know how to restart. When I had my strokes I was doing desktop and server support as well as migrating hundreds of users to the cloud (email wise - local exchange to office 365).
 Where/how should I start looking? I really wanna get back to my career again and I&#x27;m not too proud to be the guy who brings coffee every morning :)
 Thanks guys/gals!

 Error: Snapshots were found, but they were outside of your allowed context. Try removing them with the backup application which created them. 
 I don&#x27;t have a backup application in use. I&#x27;ve never set up Server Backup on this machine. The only thing I can think of is when I was having issues where snapshots weren&#x27;t able to be deleted on the VM host for this specific VM guest. I read that VMware Tools will use VSS. That issue has been resolved but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s related and not resolved on the guest.

 Sure, we had done some pre-planning for this, and I was prioritizing the hell out of a couple projects in the lead up. The only messages I’ve sent to anyone from work since it happened were either HR stuff like getting her added to insurance, and letting my coworkers know everyone is okay. 
 I won’t do another bit of work until September. There was no fuss from my boss. My direct reports were ready to go on taking over what they could. Nothing will catch fire. Nobody is gonna call my personal number. Im on 16 weeks of parental leave. Yes I’m in the US. Companies do exist that are not complete shit. 
 I actually changed jobs looking for a company like this. I asked about paternity leave before I would even take a first interview. I was able to go into this job from the start saying that family came first always. And I have never had a seconds pushback. 
 It’s routine for people to take unschedule WFH days if a kid is not feeling well. IT is actually the most hybrid of teams at the company. (Except the junior desktop support guys, sorry, need someone to swap keyboards when users spill coffee ). 
 I left my old job when I got laughed out of the room for asking for the same 12 weeks they gave women. 
 IT is a fairly small fraction of any company. Makes unionization tricky. But all of us can, when practical for our situations, demand better of employers. Part of that is making sure we get and use benefits we want. Part of that is setting boundaries.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to keep track of all the computer inventory in an IT dept. One of the main things I want is to be able to have it print out QR codes to stick on each piece of equipment so it can be scanned in and out. Right now we have an inventory system with the ticketing system we use called happyfox but I can&#x27;t see any feature in that which can generate a qr code to be stuck on the asset.

                              <span>So I manage internal IT for a large company of approx 250 staff. It’s relatively straightforward for me as I’ve been doing this sort of stuff for almost 3 decades now (although I learn something new every day still). But the workload is preventing me doing a few things effectively, so they’re allowing me to hire a 1st line support tech. Their role is going to be building laptops, configuring tablets and mobile devices and maintaining them (AV, updates, via an RMM, that sort of thing), 1st line support, keeping our asset register up-to-date, day to day stuff, and me there to help them, develop them, and give them opportunities.
 I’d really like to hire someone who is “into” tech, can demonstrate an ability to carry out this sort of work on their own ability and initiative, and who doesn’t n…</span>

                              <span>I know it shouldn&#x27;t call it BIOS anymore. The moment I get my hands on it I switch it to UEFI mode. I like UEFI, I know about the security issues but it&#x27;s so much more modern and I just hope the developers can resolve/limit the security risks. (also crossing fingers for an open source UEFI firmware - go coreboot! go!)
 It&#x27;s about the pronunciation: UEFI. These two vocals in the beginning. It&#x27;s killing me, they are so hard to pronounce in a fluid conversation ... so I slip and say: BIOS.
 &quot;We have to make a BIOS update.&quot;
 &quot;Go into the BIOS and see if you can find the setting for ...&quot;
 How do you handle it?
 I thought of using the term &quot;firmware&quot;. But when I say &quot;please make a firmware upgrade&quot; firmware can mean so much: BMC firmware, SSD firmware, CPLD firmware, GPU firmware, ... it&#x27;s confusing. So I slip and say: BIOS.
 I contemplate dropping the U from UEFI and just call it EFI. That would be easy to pronounce and after a while everyone should know what I mean by it. Only Apple admins will get rattled: &quot;You say EFI but then you refer to PC servers, I&#x27;m confused ...&quot;

 However, the SATA PWR Slot inside are 4 very close to each other Pins -&gt; https://i.imgur.com/KBRkFMQ.png and I&#x27;m not sure what kind of cable I need. The full model should be the fujitsu futro s900 g-t44r.

 I work for an MSP and started noticing the issue happening a couple of weeks ago. At first it only affected one customer on one computer, by this point it has affected at least 3 different clients.
 The issue is that Microsoft desktop applications cannot complete the sign-in process properly. It is particularly noticeable in Outlook where autodiscover to https://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml fails.
 Web apps and sign in are unaffected by this issue, it is only happening with the desktop applications.

                              <span>We&#x27;re finally implementing a ticket system at work because I&#x27;m getting some additional manpower in the support department. The plan is to have an e-mail address &quot;support@ourcompany.com&quot; that pumps the tickets into the ticketing system (osTicket) and only accepts mail from us to prevent other people from creating random tickets.
 The support of our mail hoster said we could create rules for this using the Sieve language. I&#x27;ve tried multiple variations that should imo get this done, but it&#x27;s not working.
 Current version of the script:
 if address :contains :domain &quot;from&quot; [&quot;ourcompany.com&quot;, &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot;, &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot;] { keep; stop; } else { discard; } 
 I&#x27;ve tried with :matches :domain and with :contains :all but sending test mail from an outlook.com address still lets through the e-mail. I also tried with if not address ... discard; but that yields the same, unsatisfying, result.
 Has anyone run into this before?
 Edit: I accomplished what I wanted to do, even if not in the exact way I&#x27;d have liked.
 I created two ticket filters in osTicket to do this. I need two filters because if I only apply the second filter, all e-mail gets rejected for some reason and no tickets are created.
 Filter 1: &quot;E-Mail accept&quot; 
 Priority: 1 Stop execution on filter match: Yes Filter any of criteria: User Email contains &quot;ourcompany.com&quot; User Email contains &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot; User Email contains &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot; Do: Set help topic to &quot;Support&quot; 
 Filter 2: &quot;E-Mail reject&quot;
 Priority: 2 Stop execution on filter match: No Filter any of criteria: User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany.com&quot; User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany2.com&quot; User Email NOT contains &quot;ourcompany3.com&quot; Do: Disable notification on new ticket Discard ticket

                              <span>We’ve been experiencing this issue for quite some time now. Users are starting to get really frustrated and I don’t blame them.
 Basically, Teams calls are lagging/stuttering/freezing when users are connected to office LAN. There doesn’t seem to be an obvious pattern to this - it can happen when on a call with a small number of people and also large. It will happen with both audio and video calls. It’s random, happening for all users, even when connected to the office WiFi. 
 Users working remotely don’t experience this problem. We can have people outside the office on the same call as those in the office, and only those in the office get this issue (affects everyone on the call in the office at same time). It’s making it impossible to have a reliable conversation over Teams when physicall…</span>

 Tried and just amazed all function is just like a commercial edr solution.
 But I don&#x27;t think a &quot;opensource&quot; edr can really deployed into corporate environment. Furthermore the portal is just managed service.
 Does anyone have tried/deployed OpenEDR in their environment?

I originally got into being a network engineer after my mentor who I met at my first help desk role said I should learn Cisco. I got the CCNA and switched to jr neteng role and I really liked it. After 2 moves, I now hold a sr network eng position for an electronics retailer. The position is nice, good pay, boss is laid back, its just me, my boss and 1 other guy on the network side. Have about 200 locations and 3 Colo POP/DCs. Got a few certs: sec+, CWNA, couple of CCNPs. I like the position but I feel I could get more pay and/or take on more challenging net…</span>

                              <span>I’m essentially an IT consultant, and the place I stay in Zimbabwe has awful internet. They currently have 25mbps for 12 rooms, and right now I’m getting into UniFi networking so I’m getting more involved with this space for them.
 The whole place is concrete and there are no access points except two, one in a room at the end of an L block and one in a kitchen that is where the L meets. They will never install ACs in every room (and they change the configuration of the rooms almost every time I come back, it’s a Zimbabwean thing).
 So, the internet gets so bad that we can’t even load websites, and while I know they could be doing stuff to help, they’re thinking simply upping from 25 to like 40mbps would do the trick. So I have to ask, how does one determine what is the right amount to purchase? Or is 25mbps actually fine and the bad speeds are only due to the poor planning on their ACs?

                              <span>I am working on a project that uses a spool of ethernet cable on a modified hose reel which can be wound in and out. One end is connected to a device which reads gas composition and dropped down a hole about 100 feet. The other end is plugged into my laptop where I can view live readings. This connection must be made and the device turned on manually at the surface, before it is dropped, so I cannot unplug the connection to the laptop at any time. 
 The problem I have is that while the cable is being unwound and the device lowered down the hole, the cable end going to my laptop is simultaneously spinning/twisting up. If it drops 100 feet, there&#x27;s suddenly 70 or so windings in my 6 ft of ethernet cable between the laptop and the spool of cable. 
 Can you think of any solution to this? I essentially hand wind/spin the cable in the opposite direction 50 times or so every time I connect to the spool so it minimizes the problem but I am looking for an elegant solution. Perhaps some kind of preload spring/spool that keeps it wound in the opposite direction or a special highly-rotatable cable or something. Any ideas would be appreciated! 
 Also, any ideas for a powered winch which holds 200 ft of cat7? I&#x27;ve been looking at anchor winches but they only seem to hold 100 ft of .20 rope. Also looking at modifying a harbour freight winch, but I need to solve this current problem of the cable twisting first.

Dynamically update the graph based on link status. If a link goes down, the line between two routers turns red.
 
 I used to use Intermapper but I was wondering what else is out there and what works well.

 I have a guest ssid as well that people can connect to it using just a password.
 I want to know if i can use this device for extending the strength of the wifi so people could use this &quot;home device&quot; extender ( just for the guest ssid that is being used for connecting with a password)

                              <span>Hello r/networking!
 We’re in the process of setting up our network in a small environment (under 100 employees). 2x firewalls, 2x core switches, 2x edge switches, and 2x DC switches. Basically, the essentials.
 We want to grow this tiny plant, provide enough sunlight and water it daily in order to reach the heavens, and its roots heavily planted. In other words, an anti-fragile beast that can stand the test of time.
 To achieve that, we obviously have to follow some steps. Solid configurations, backup policies, physical security, insightful monitoring… etc.
 There’s one big issues, though. I don’t know where to start. I’m capable of learning nonetheless. 
 So, my questions (and humble requests) to you, esteemed network engineers, what are some resources I can use to build a strong base for our network? I.e. best practices.
 What are the must have’s, and the good to have’s? Should we just buy every buzzword solution that are out there, or just stick with the essentials and call it a day? But what we can call essential and what we can call superficial? For example, is a NAC solution a must have? What about an IPAM?
 Again, I’m reaching out to the ocean of knowledge that’s you hoping for an answer (or an advice) to some, if not all, of my questions. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all,
 Certificate management is one of my weaknesses. Our domain root CA needs to be renewed shortly. Can this be managed in a cloud based environment (e.g. Azure)? Currently we have a dedicated server for our root CA and another for a CA. If this can be managed in a cloud environment without dedicated virtual machines, that would be great.
 Thanks

                              <span>Currently I use an encrypted password file (Some powershell password module) to run my automated scripts on our tools server. If we change the password for that service account, I have to change the file (not a huge deal) but I would like to find a way for this to be autonomous. In that the password rotates every 3 months or so and instead of there being an encrypted file on the server, it reaches out to say Azure Keyvault or something (This is where my ignorance shows).
 ​
 I know there is Jenkins, Github CI etc but not sure where to start. Was hearing good things about Github CI.
 ​
 Would also like to rotate the service account passwords for accounts that run flows (they have premium licenses on them)
 ​
 Only thing here is that changing the password breaks the flows as the connections need to be rebuilt with the current password. Is there a way to have them reach out to key vault or something similiar instead?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in IT at the same (small) company for nearly 2 decades. My technical title was sysadmin but it was everything from device deployment/management to end-user support to enterprise networking to you name it. It truly is a thankless job but I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, loved my co-workers, and made decent money.
 I have accepted a new job which I start Monday doing cloud architecture for clients. No more end-users, no more printers, no more on-call, 100% remote, and most importantly a 50% RAISE (plus 10% yearly bonus)! Not to mention paid certifications in everything Azure and AWS. And if I have an IT problem I get to be the end-user and call the helpdesk, lol. 
 Is this it? Did I finally make the big time?! It all feels kinda surreal...
 EDIT: I didn&#x27;t expect this to blow up like it did. Sorry if I haven&#x27;t responded to you. I&#x27;m about to head to bed but I&#x27;ll try to get to everyone tomorrow. Thanks for all the well wishes!

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone has any experience with software that can provide certificates to clients similar to SecureW2 but perhaps via FLOSS like OpenSSL. I know this can be done with Microsoft Intune as well but that seems to focus on managed devices like company assets. I am wondering about something that can be used for devices not in the control of the enterprise but that are used on their Wifi infrastructure (like students at a campus for instance). I think getting the certificate is not difficult however the missing piece seems to be with how to easily get the certificate installed and the wifi network configured to use it for EAP-TLS. There are many client types (Windows, OSX, Android, etc) so it would have to work across a breadth of devices. Any direction would be appreciated.

                              <span>Granted I am relatively new to being a salaried employee. I got my first salaried position a year ago and have now had two. It always felt kinda like a scam unless the company would also very open about &quot;If your work is done just go home/log off&quot;. If they expect me to be available 40 hours then I&#x27;m doing 40 and not a second more.
 I work to support the rest of my life and reach my financial goals. The position I have now I took because it paid the most of all of my offers. Why would I work for free, essentially reducing my salary per hour?

 They all asked if they could email me something, so it seemed like they’re just building a database. Expect more targeted spam or spearphishing.

                              <span>I’m a Helpdesk manager who has been in tech for 5.5 years, supervisor for 2 and manager for 1 of those years. Worked for a global international corporation for 4 of those 5 years. I really can’t see myself working for another MSP again and I would love to specialise in something else. Thinking maybe devops or cloud admin but the problem is that I don’t have any experience in these fields. A lot of my technical skills are for very specific out of date technologies which no one uses anymore. Helpdesk was fun but I feel like I’ve lost interest in this field and I’m dreaming of something bigger and better. I would have absolutely loved to be CTO one day but with this setback and my age of 35 I feel like that’s a dream which is fading. If there’s any silver lining, the redundancy package is pretty good so I have a good several months to live off without being desperate so I could upskill. I genuinely feel like I’ve ruined my career by being so focused on getting promoted in a Helpdesk which is so irrelevant. Any advice or if anyone who has been in this situation before could shed some light would be very much appreciated.

                              <span>We have a system in place where when someone needs to be a part of a AD group to get some kind of access, they submit a request in ARQ. Depending on what service/tool they are asking access to, an email goes to their manager or the service owner. Once they approve it, the user gets added to the AD group. 
 Is there any third party alternative that we can use to simplify this process? Any tool or something that you guys are using to handle such requests.

                              <span>Hi to the folks at r/sysadmin, I would like some advice on a few subjects:
 ​
  
For quite some time, the team was trying to find a resiliency solution for some of the software that is used in the company. The software is monolithic &amp; can&#x27;t run in multiple instances. So, we&#x27;re forced to deploy new hardware to each location. My idea would&#x27;ve been to consolidate all of the hardware onto a pair of powerful servers (one located at our offices, the other one off-site) and virtualize all 100+ machines onto these servers – that way, if one of these VM servers were to fall over, the team would be able to rapidly spin up a new server &amp; get the branch up and running very quickly (15 minutes max). this idea got shot down. 
 
We use a mix of local AD, Google Workspace &amp; M365 as our environment. I&#x27;ve been trying to convince both my team lead (who&#x27;s the IT manager) and boss (the CIO/CTO) to try and unify everything under one vendor for ease of deployment, management &amp; troubleshooting for the long term – once again, the idea got shot down. 
 
All our infrastructure is not managed by any form of MDM, I pitched this idea, and it got promptly shot down. 
 
 I really like the current workplace, but trying to convince them to change/rebuild the current infrastructure for the better, just results in resistance from them. I’ve tried to talk to them to see why they are resisting change/shooting down any ideas. the only reasons that I got from the CIO/CTO was that it&#x27;s due to financial &amp; &quot;if it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it&quot; reasons. So far, I’ve been unsuccessful in trying to get *any* ideas to stick.
 Any advice on how to approach this?
 (P.S. this is my 2nd proper job as I had to leave the 1st one due to health reasons. Also, excuse the weird formatting; LibreOffice &amp; Reddit&#x27;s new UX don&#x27;t like each other a bit)

                              <span>Are there any places considered &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; when it comes to working in IT? Places that are generally considered a last resort to people so to say? I&#x27;ve always considered schools as a bottom of the barrel, however, i have no reason to think that. I also view MSPs as that, because I hear a lot of horror stories from there.
 I&#x27;m aware this is probably personal opinion but just seeing what everybody else thinks

 Fully remote org. I’m implementing an internal IT function. There are several users popping in requests for Google accounts for collaborating with other orgs that are using Google. Most of them have been creating personal gmail accounts.
 At my previous gig we were a Google shop and needed Microsoft 365 for some folks. We had onprem AD and were able to sync logins across all platforms. Am I crazy for thinking we can do the reverse in this case? We have azure ad instead of onprem. I would imagine I can disable gmail and restrict Google drive to make sure we maintain data governance, but that is all conjecture at this point as I’ve never done it before.
 Any thoughts from people who have done it before? Will disabling gmail totally break other apps? I’m probably missing a lot but open to suggestions. My team thinks we should investigate the use cases more as there’s a perception we don’t really need Google accounts to collaborate like this. They may be right but it could end up being more work trying to walk multiple external orgs through proper sharing processes so we can work with them.

 Me: &quot;yeah, it&#x27;s just really slow, see look.&quot;
 Suit: &quot;Is this our production server?&quot;
 No, it&#x27;s Dev.
 But we do work on Dev, correct?
 Uh, yeah, people use it if that&#x27;s what you mean.
 Whatever is causing it to malfunction, I want this fixed immediately. Today.
 I&#x27;m kind of slammed today, probably Monday looking better.
 Listen to me, I cannot afford delays on my project, whatever else you are working on can wait.
 Yeah, definitely, I&#x27;ll make sure it&#x27;s fixed today. Suit walks away. *Reboots server*
 Later that day: Hey Steve, I got that server fixed man, just had to toggle the RAM allocation to CPU cache, and run the bitwise script on the hard drive. Thing is running like new again.
 Okay sounds good, have a good weekend.

                              <span>Hey everyone. 
 I work as a system admin and ERP Administrator, I also serve as the technical lead for the team. Our company is looking to bring in some new hires to fill vacant positions. 
 I&#x27;m still notably green, as I&#x27;ve only been in this position for ~2 years. The positions we&#x27;re hiring for will likely require assistance with learning skillsets that either I have just started learning, or will have to learn with them. 
 Additionally, I&#x27;ve never had reporting employees that I&#x27;ve had to train before. 
 Could you please share any advice/resources you have on training new hires? What has worked for you, what hasn&#x27;t?
 Viewpoints from the eyes of the trainee are appreciated too!
 Thank you :)

                              <span>I think the answer to this is going to be &quot;no&quot;, but before I declare defeat I wanted to run this past everyone to see if you have any ideas. Here&#x27;s the situation:
  
The platform is M365 / Exchange Online.
 Currently, a number of teams share a generic user mailbox.
 If a user needs the mailbox on a mobile device, they currently just have the user mailbox added as the only mailbox.
 This situation is historic from many years ago.
 Compliance requirements are now forcing the organisation to ensure all users authenticate with unique credentials. It&#x27;s obviously also a good idea from a general infosec perspective and will ensure M365 licensing is correct, so it&#x27;s helpful that compliance is finally forcing the change.
  
To achieve this, we will create each user an AAD account with a license app…</span>

You can do secure case and bolt it down but that&#x27;s just deterent at the end of the day.

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I have short question. we have 300+ zones in our DNS environment. If I set the TTL time to 5 minutes will there be any negative impact on DNS Server?
 is it likely that the 5 minute TTL is being ignored outright, because of fast flux countermeasures?
 ​
 thanks in advance,

Turning on the LinkedIn &quot;open to work&quot; setting flooded my DM&#x27;s with recruiters looking for their next finders fee. Needless to say I&#x27;ve spoken with quite a few and some have been helpful and others talk about themselves for 40 minutes and tell you that they&#x27;ve never hear of an MSP before.
 What are your surreal recruiter conversations you&#x27;ve had in these cramped markets?

                              <span>I just accepted a position with a company a 4.5 hour drive away. I start Monday. They just sent me the benefits information and I just discovered that there are no in-network doctors where I live. That means I&#x27;ll have to pay a co-pay for everything, even an annual physical, and if I ever need a prescription, need to see a specialist, or have an emergency, that will likely wipe out all of the raise I&#x27;m getting by taking this job as well as money I&#x27;m saving by not commuting.
 For any non-Americans trying to parse the above paragraph: yes, our health system is as fucked up as you&#x27;ve heard. If you ever have a politician in your country suggest changing your health system to be more like ours, hang them from the nearest tree.
 So what else did &quot;they&quot; not tell me about working remotely?

 We are looking to set Ecosia as our default search engine for the user base, and although I have added it to the list of search engines using Group Policy I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to set the &quot;Search engine used in the address bar&quot; option, it never changes from Bing. Is there a specific policy or registry key I&#x27;ve missed for this? I&#x27;d have thought it would be simple!
 Thanks.

                              <span>If you have a small (3-6 host) new cluster running ESXi 8 and around 15-20TB of VMs sat on an SSD enterprise NAS which would you use?
 I don&#x27;t know which NAS yet but I mean enterprise like say NetApp rather than Synology/QNAP/FreeNAS type stuff. 
 I know there isn&#x27;t a right answer to this so I&#x27;m interested why you&#x27;d go in either direction.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made a few purchases of drives directly from Western Digital. Someone here pointed out that their online store and RMA systems were off-line for several days, presumably because of a ransomware incident. Their e-Commerce site has been off-line for 6 weeks .
 I just received an email from WDC notifying me of an &quot;incident&quot; involving their on-line store. My purchase data has been compromised.
 ​
  
The information included customer names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers. As a security measure, the relevant database stored, in encrypted format, hashed passwords (which were salted) and partial credit card numbers.
  
No word on how this happened, but I think the working assumption is that a WDC employee opened an infected file that allowed the ransomware to run through their systems.
 WDC provides these &quot;helpful tips&quot; to people whose data was compromised:
 ​
  
As a precautionary measure, you can take the following steps to help protect your personal information from potential misuse: 
 + Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information. 
 + Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. 
 + Check whether your email account has spam settings to help you detect or block suspicious emails. 
 We hope this information is useful to you
  
​
 Gee, thanks, WDC. You do the same, M-Kay?

                              <span>I work at a mid size non profit and we use an IT vendor to manage our network and computers. We have a mix of ITaaS and HaaS agreements with them but I’m looking to purchase more equipment elsewhere when needed because it’s often much cheaper and I’d rather us own the equipment and not get locked into rental agreements. 
 We’re opening a new office and now I find out they will not let us purchase a firewall. We have to rent one from them in a 5 year agreement that’s about twice the price than if I purchased elsewhere. They say it’s because they lump in the IT management fee for the firewall in the rental price. 
 Is this reasonable or common practice? I don’t see why we can just buy a firewall and pay them a management fee. 
 Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;ve asked this question before on other subs, but none have been able to figure it out.
 I have two fairly old Macs desktops, running windows, and I&#x27;m trying to wipe everything and just use Linux (Ubuntu).
 I&#x27;m struggling with getting them to boot from USB. I&#x27;ve tried ventoy (not supported on Macs), and making a bootable USB through Linux mints&#x27; standard &quot;make a bootable USB&quot; option. Both give me &quot;secure boot 14&quot; error. But googling that gives we information about windows?
 At this point I just want to nuke the machines, wipe everything and just have Ubuntu. I don&#x27;t care about the windows partition because it runs too slow to be of any use anyway. There is no important data on them as the owners have resorted to just using their laptops.
 One machine has only windows on it, and it was still stuck at the splash screen after leaving it overnight. The other has a working windows OS on it - this is the main one I&#x27;m trying to save. Both throw up the same &quot;secure boot 14&quot; error.
 And to top it all off, they&#x27;re all using Chinese language operating systems. So I&#x27;m reliant on Google translate from my phone to figure stuff out.
 Just for laughs: one of the business owners suggested solving the problem by buying a third Mac, and putting windows on it. Before throwing the keyboard at them (metaphorically speaking), I enquired as to why they:
 1) didn&#x27;t just use Mac OS in the first place because they just use it for excel, word, and Photoshop 2) didn&#x27;t use a windows based machine 3) thought that buying a third Mac would solve the problem
 They don&#x27;t know how to use Mac OS; Macs look nicer; a new Mac would be faster.

                              <span>We were looking at the potential use case of having Active Directory Cloud Sync through the Microsoft Azure P1 plan but changed our minds after checking out the annual cost per user. We prefer to go a different route which is: 
 1) Having a cloud Active Directory server privately hosted, either in GCP, AWS, or some other cloud instance provider.
 2) On premise AD server connect to Cloud AD
 3) Google Workspace synchronization with our Cloud ADWe want the workflow to be - having the Private AD Cloud server, communicating only to two destinations, the on-premise AD server(s), and Google Workspace for LDAP synchronization which will be used for the overall user and password management using Google Workspace as the MFA service and SSO identity.
  
What is the feasibility of having this solution?
  What challenges should we expect? 
 What security precautions should we take for the Cloud AD? 
 Should we add a dedicated WAF to prevent intrustion and DDOS attacks? 
  
Any help would be appreciated, thanks

                              <span>I currently find that I spend most of my day responding to trouble tickets re: networking lately.
 1st step in the process is to to request a bidirectional MTR from the problem to the problem.
 Been thinking of how to expedite this process. Thought of making a video, &quot;How to run a bidirectional MTR&quot; but seems like there are a thousand already... Then thought, I should make a website that you put in the start and end ips of the route to test, and it runs the mtr for you and gives you the results...but there seem to be many of those as well. What tools does anyone here use? There has to be faster way, I spend half my time requesting an mtr, the other half explaining what it is and how to generate one...Any tips appreciated.

                              <span>Right now, we have a mixture of cat5e and cat6 running throughout the building (added over the years). During the last big addition, we tried to future proof, but now we are moving the server room so we are re-wiring. We are an entertainment facility. About 60% of our network bandwith is multicast traffic as all of our projectors/tvs get the data from a few VM&#x27;s powered by Proxmox as well as HDMI to RTSP encoders. By the end of the summer, we are increasing the number of TVs/projectors from 23 to about 35-37, while also increasing our in-house tv channels that are being broadcast from our proxmox servers. Right now, all the content (other than Comcast) is being fed from our Synology server). I am worried about that being a bottleneck as it may need to feed 10 1080p/4k files continuously to each VMs to be broadcast... Our Synology is also our file server and at times it is definitely slow. (I can&#x27;t add a cache drive to it)
 If I decide to go 10gig, then I will also be spec&#x27;ing out another server with some SSD&#x27;s in it or at least able to add some SSD cache..
 If I decide to not go 10gig, I will still be looking to get a bigger NAS. Just not sure which way to go...
 Also currently, it is 8:30pm on Saturday night and we have 235 devices connected to our network.. (Our high is about 430 devices).

                              <span>Need some help here with understanding Unifi’s guest captive portal capabilities. The documentation I’ve been able to find is rubbish and I don’t have a Unifi network to test on… not a great start. 
  
Can it do T&amp;Cs + Email authentication (no password, just collecting email for marketing purposes)?
 If not, is there a list somewhere of supported third party hotspots, or is it possible to DIY one?
 Can the captive portal operate without a controller (i.e run on an AP) or can it run using the cloud controller, or do you have to have a dream machine/physical controller on-prem?
  
Unifi wouldn’t be my first choice, so if anyone has thoughts on cheap-ish no controller access points that can serve a decent captive portal, (commercial solution, not openwrt etc) would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have a general question about the vm live migration implementation. Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask.
 It&#x27;s more or less clear to me how the VM can be live migrated from one physical host to another by copying and then syncing disk / RAM as well as state of VM&#x27;s NIC and other &quot;hardware&quot;.
 However, between the client and host there is a non-trivial number of stateful networking equipment. Once you move the VM to another host, new network route will involve different equipment which is unaware of the preexisting connections.
 How is it achieved that existing TCP connections to the VM are preserved without an interruption? Are there scholarly articles that explore approaches of proprietary vendors such as vMotion in detail?

                              <span>I am a little confused with the segmentation of voice data. 
 I learned that you would want to segment VoIP traffic from Client Data traffic and that you can daisy chain a desk-phone to a PC and configure VLAN and Voice VLAN on the switch. 
 We have Cisco MS Merakis at work. 
 How do i segment voice traffic if we implement soft phones running on the clients?
 Through the VLAN and Voice VLAN setting? 
 My idea is that i could enable port isolation on the Switches if i cant segment VoIP and data traffic. That way no other Client should be able to sniff their packages am i right? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello!
 I need to get ip adresses of a domain to do some traffic filtering. How to approach the case of updating the ip adreesses after expiration such that the rule which filters the traffic to still be applied?
 For example, dig +short www.google.com gives me an ip address. Is TTL field the time after the IP address is changed and I should get the ip again?
 My thinking is to do a cronjob which is running every TTL seconds and writes ip adresses in a file, then I compare the current result with the adresses from that file. If the adresses are changed it means the ips were changed. Is my approach correct?

 I&#x27;m testing Ubiquiti UAP-AC-M-PRO (commercial) and Huawey 5731R-11E (enterprise) with external omni antenna.
 During a test the coverage at 2.4 and 5GHz is the same. I&#x27;m not an expert and I don&#x27;t see the difference.
 I&#x27;ve seen the supported users for every radio is very different, the configuration is more detailed in the Huawei interface.
 Can I&#x27;ve your opinion?

                              <span>I just need to get this off my chest. The whole situation is lousy. Certain things I have to be vague about. I am an IT Director with a strong hands-on technical background. I started about 6 months ago working for a small enterprise, family owned, about 10 locations globally, ~1000 employees and contractors. My boss the CIO started only 6 months before me, and my position was newly created. I have 4 full time staff working for me, 3 young helpdesk people, and one systems/network engineer. Plus a number of consultants and MSP&#x27;s we work with for various things. The workload is very, very high and demanding, but I&#x27;m used to that sort of thing. There is a great deal of end-user related support, but also a fair amount of enterprise networking and on-prem data center stuff (server room), nothin…</span>

                              <span>Have a few Hyper-V and each hosts 50+ VMs.
 Occasionally, need to reboot some VMs manually. Current setup is through the RMM software installed on Hyper-V host: staff on allowed list send an email with title like &quot;reboot vm 120&quot; to an internal email, then a powerautome kicks in, sends an api request to rmm server, rmm server then send a job to a rmm agent that executes a reboot.
 This process works well, but it is a bit slow. Often takes about 10 - 15 minutes.
 How to make it faster?
 Staff is on another vlan, can give access to hyper-v host&#x27;s vlan. 
 Cannot give staff credentials to hyper-v host.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Recently took an internal IT position at a lawfirm, around 100 users. They have about 10 permanent remote users. Thought virtualizing the remote users desktops and repurposing their machines would be a good idea since they are always growing. Received the quote below and now I&#x27;m rethinking that as it&#x27;s twice as much as I expected(over 40k after tax). Is this a bad idea I should just abandon? Cheaper/better options out there I don&#x27;t know about? Welcoming all opinions.

 They claim that users are dropping SPAM filtering services and using their platform instead. Same claim for AV. 
 Any users of Coro made these changes?

                              <span>I was sick and tired of getting all these fake &quot;EFT Remittance&quot; emails sent to my clients. You know the ones, they have a HTML file attachment that takes you to a fake O365 login that steals your password.
 I decided to create an Exchange mail rule to block any email that has an .HTML attachment (and others like .HTM). Bam, perfect. Stopped getting like 30 spam tickets a week.
 Today, I got an EFT Remittance email. The attachment? An .EML file!
 Can you guess what the EML file contained? That&#x27;s right - another fake EFT Remittance email with an HTML file inside!
 I feel defeated, I can&#x27;t block .EML attachments for obvious reasons. I enjoyed the silence while it lasted.

                              <span>Heaven help me, after 20 years of working for myself, and 7 years of corporate culture but in a small rural area... our board hired an outsider from a major city to come in and be our new President. They&#x27;ve already put things in motion to shoehorn our organization into how their last place was....
 Well last week and new HR director was hired also from a much larger corporation. And next week, what do you know, they are implementing an EDGE program. Education, Development, Growth and Engagement. 
 So of course, they want to do &quot;anonymous&quot; surveys, focus groups and one-on-one meetings. Well my meeting with the Bobs is next week. 
 Sigh. I just needed 15 more years to build out my 401K. Let&#x27;s pray this doesn&#x27;t piss me off that I need to take my antiquated self out looking for a new job!

                              <span>Sooo, our CFO just &quot;retired&quot; after over a decade, and no replacement was announced, which leads me to believe it was not voluntary. Our CEO is in his 80s and, while I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s an expert in his field (Bioinformatics) The C-Level execs don&#x27;t seem too IT savvy.
 Even my direct supervisor has openly stated he is more of a &quot;People Person&quot; than an technical expert. I just started about 10 months ago, and have been working on a project that has been ongoing for over a year and a half. We needed to re-architect the infrastructure to support Azure Kubernetes Service. And while things on the Infra side are pretty good, the application is still in development. I don&#x27;t think it will ever be done.
 We are also dealing with high turnover, and nobody seems to know what&#x27;s going on. There&#x27;s no structure, our ticketing system sucks. I&#x27;ve brought this up multiple times before, but nobody is willing to take on more work. 
 So at this point, with the CFO gone, I think there is going to be a lot more scrutiny of projects going forward. We finally hired some dedicated Project Managers, but at this point I&#x27;m kind of over all of it. I&#x27;m just waiting for the fireworks. Anyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!

                              <span>If so, your implementation of Exchange ActiveSync on Android is broken and out of spec.
 Every once in a while we&#x27;ll have some weird issue on Android where the device stops syncing, which can only be diagnosed by looking at the EAS logs. Most of the time it&#x27;s because Android is trying to add an OrganizerName attribute as a child element of Exception, which is unsupported and causes the calendar to stop syncing entirely.

 ...
 X-MS-ASError: Message &#x3D; The element &#x27;Exception&#x27; in namespace &#x27;Calendar:&#x27; has invalid child element &#x27;OrganizerName&#x27; in namespace &#x27;Calendar:&#x27;. List of possible elements expected: &#x27;Reminder, Categories, Sensitivity, Attendees&#x27; in namespace &#x27;Calendar:&#x27;.; Severity &#x3D; Error 
 At first I thought this was because our Exchange server is old and I&#x27;m holding up hopes that our Exchange Online migration would fix it. But I&#x27;m not sure I believe that since OrganizerName isn&#x27;t listed as a valid child element of Exception in the Microsoft Exchange documentation, either.
 Oh, and while I&#x27;m at it... sometimes Gmail will stop syncing for a user until I clear their out-of-office response. WTF?
 iPhone works perfectly fine. This is the polite version of the post, I could rant about what a PITA Android has been for me but I shouldn&#x27;t.

No MS Services running with my account name
 
No scheduled tasks running with my account name
 
Nothing in IIS using my account name
 
 Can anyone suggest a tool that I could use to help figure out what on this server is trying to use my account name?
 EDIT: 
 Current theory is that another server I work on has some lingering connection it&#x27;s trying to authenticate on my troublesome machine. Plan is to turn off all of my dev servers that aren&#x27;t essential for keeping the environment up and running, hope that this stops the lockouts, then bring them back one by one until the lockouts start happening again.
 EDIT EDIT:
 After having multiple lockouts this morning, I&#x27;ve been free and clear since shutting down other servers. Starting to be confident that I&#x27;ll be able to determine which server is sending the request, but going to leave them down for the weekend to see if the trend continues.

I don&#x27;t have an smtp server which can do no auth so I was looking for a service. Preferably something with a free tier as this will send 100 emails a year tops.

 I&#x27;m sure someone in this sub has run into this silly problem.

                              <span>I recently changed jobs into a Sysadmin\Network Admin role. I am just getting a feel for the network and making small improvements like lldp broadcast, storm control, and syslog servers. I have run into a small issue and was wondering if anyone here has overcome it. I am used to Cisco switches, while these Dell switches run a form of Cisco iOS I am locked into read only mode with CLI. From what I have read unless you factory reset the switch that is the case all the time, even though there is a security checkbox to allow 15 level access over CLI, but when checked it goes right back to unchecked in the web gui. This makes a 20 second change in CLI to all interfaces take almost an hour clicking through the web UI and waiting on it to load each time. 
 ​
 Has anyone here found a way to write changes via CLI on these Dell switches other than factory resetting?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been encountering difficulties when executing DFSRAMIN Membershipset, and I can&#x27;t find any logs that might indicate the cause of these errors.
 ​
 I have also attempted to use the Powershell Module Set-DfsrMemberShip, but it results in the same problem. This method works on other machines; however, it occasionally fails, and no matter what I try, the issue persists.
 ​
 Our existing configuration is as follows:
 Server 1: On-Site Source
 Server 2: On-Site Destination
 Server 3: Data Center Backup
 ​
 The command functions properly between Server 1 and 2, allowing me to establish the local path. However, when I include Server 3, I can add it as a member, but I&#x27;m unable to execute Membership Set and configure the LocalPath.
 ​
 Command
 dfsradmin Membership Set /RgName:$DFSName /RfName:$DFSName /MemName:$DFSServer /LocalPath:$dfsServerRepFolder /MembershipEnabled:true /StagingSize:4096 /CDSize:4096 /IsPrimary:false
 ​
 Generic Error Message:

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Since the current translated subtitles in teams are not up to professional standards (misinterpreting company names and stuff) I’ve been looking into better working alternatives.
 I haven’t been able to find anything really, azure cognitive services seemed cool but damn, that’s a whole rabbithole 
 Does anyone have an idea? 
 It needs to be translated live and be displayed somewhat accurately. Or is the built-in teams version the best I’ll get?
 Thanks 😀

I&#x27;ve always use a 3rd party like Kaspersky endpoint security or ESET NOD32. What are y&#x27;alls experience with only relying on Microsoft defender, is it enough?

 Box and Synology are still working on the issue, and I believe are in some sort on dialogue.
 Synology developers posted in the Box Forum.
 Expanding on the behaviour they noticed, I played with the API url from the CloudSync authentication popup and worked out that modifying the &amp;state parameter to html-encode http:// to http%3A%2F%2F solves the problem. The modified URL needs to be loaded from the pop-up window, not from a different browser window, so a little console trickery is needed...
 Below are the steps to replicate my workaround: 
  
Open CloudSync
 Click the + icon to create a new link
 Select Box and click Next
 The popup authentication window appears (with the 403 Forbidden error)
 Copy the entire URL
 Pressed Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up the Browser Developer Tools
 Switch to the console tab
 Type the following into the console (note the single apostrophe at the end):
 self.location &#x3D; ‘
 Paste the URL copied in step 5
 Locate &amp;state&#x3D;http://x.x.x.x:5000 at the end of the URL and change it to:
 &amp;state&#x3D;http%3A%2F%2Fx.x.x.x:5000 (i.e. replacing the first : with %3A and each / with %2F. Don’t change anything else)
 Type a closing ’
 Press enter
 The Box authentication window should appear and you should be able to grant permission successfully.
 
 My sync is up and running after 8 days and lots of inconvenience.
 And now we wait for an official fix!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been patching Chrome and Firefox via SCCM for quite some time now and more recently started using Tenable security scanning. Tenable has been finding Chrome and Firefox installs in the C:\Users space which SCCM has not been targetting. The collections I have only find Chrome/Firefox in Program Files that SCCM itself would have deployed. I have now created some Configuration items to locate these user installs and I want to convert these to the enterprise browser versions. My issue is how do I handle bookmarks? If I uninstall the browser from the C:\User they will lose their bookmarks. I&#x27;ve been researching how to backup bookmarks and restore them in an automated way but I haven&#x27;t found a great answer. Has anyone else gone through this?

                              <span>We currently have ARC and MMA agents deployed to our servers. Every so often i run the “Unavailable Computers” query in log analytics to check up on the mma agent availability but i cannot get the email alerting to work. When i turn this query into an alert rule the preview shows 0 and no emails work. Suggestions?
 How is everyone monitoring these agents for disconnects or faulty services on the server?

 I&#x27;m relatively new to it, but we have reports generated for us which contain machines that have some issues. 
 How often does D365 perform a software inventory on devices? What is the initial or interval period?
 Is there a way to check when it was last conducted?
 How long does that device information stay in D365?
 Many thanks to anyone that can provide some advice or guidance

                              <span>Heyho everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently in the planing phase for the replacement of a lot older thinclients in a warehouse enviroment. For the last 10-12 years the company went the way of buying refurbished/cheap used devices to replace the faulty ones since &quot;they are just thin clients&quot;. In the last 2 years of support for them, we had like 3 or 4 devices that failed. To be fair, some were straight up old and gave up mostly because of that, however the others suffered from enviromental problems. A warehouse is full of various kinds of dirt &amp; dust in the air that settles down everywhere. Employees touch things with dirty hands and so on.
 ​
 I thought it might be better to instead replace most TCs now with some higher quality devices (and switch at that time over to Igel OS) that last longer because they are designed for that enviroment. The devices mostly potray some old software, nothing newer that could push the hardware requirements. Some raspberry Pis could probably do the job ..
 ​
 So yeah .. Any recommendations?

                              <span>I consider myself a decent programmer, but unfortunately, I lack experience in server administration and maintaining a production environment. Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve developed a web app that I want to bring live for field testing purposes. I&#x27;ve already set up a virtual server at Hetzner.com with a firewall and other security measures, such as disabling password logins.
 My application consists of:
  
NestJs/NodeJs backend
 Vue.js SPA frontend, which can be served by NestJs but also deployed independently
 Redis
 MongoDB
  
My plan is to run all of these components on a single virtual server for the testing phase (and as long as it is sufficient). I think I&#x27;ll use Docker for this setup.
 Do you have any suggestions/tips regarding this setup or thoughts on issues I may have missed? For example, regarding:
  
Logging and monitoring
 Do you recommend Docker for this setup?
 Any security measures I may have missed?
 Should I include Nginx as a reverse proxy, and why?
  
As I said this is my first own live environment and I&#x27;d really appreciate any suggestions and help.

 i am wondering if anyone has got this figured.
 We would like to use Roaming Profiles with Google Cloud Sync, currently the user needs to do this every now and again and with Mandatory Profiles they need to enable turn on sync every time. 
 The only way around this would be to change the location of chrome files which only allows one instance of chrome which does not work in our environment.
 i have enabled the policy for the new azure sync settings as well as signing on which works but does not turn on cloud sync that goes through another popup.
 i am wondering if anyone has any ideas how i can turn on Cloud Sync without user intervention or any policies or reg tweaks, any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Hello, 
 We&#x27;re making our super-late upgrade from Exchange 2010 to 2016 (and after that to 2019), after inheriting an old environment and finding out updates not working. 
 After installing Exchange 2016 on a new server, we&#x27;ve ran into issues with migrating mailboxes: &quot;Unsupported source mailbox version Version 14.0 ‎(Build 639.0)‎.&quot;
 That version should stand for Exchange 2010 RTM. The 2010 server itself is supposed to be patched. 
 What I&#x27;ve checked:
 - In the EMC the server version shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot; - EMC is said to be inaccurate: Application binary versions (checked from the running store.exe location, no second wrong install locations) are 14.3.513.0, which should be the very last rollup of SP3
 - Get-ExchangeServer AdminDisplayVersion also shows &quot;14.0 (Build 639.21)&quot;
 - The current Exchange schema version is rangeUpper 15332 (or Exchange 2016 CU18)
 - The &quot;Exchange Servers&quot; AD group only contains current running (the 2010 and 2016) servers
 - In ADSIEdit, Configuration/Services/Microsoft Exchange/[domain]/Administrative Groups/Exchange Administrative Group (...)/Servers also only contains the current running servers
 What I&#x27;ve tried:
 - First, most of the instructions that were followed are from the Exchange Deployment Assistant
 - Trying to run the upgraded installer for 2010 just to be sure but it says nothing to upgrade
 - Searching for any non-installed updates through Windows update, including hidden ones - Restarted services and machines so no lingering processes should exist
 - Creating a new database on the 2010 server and moving mailboxes to it in case the database has an affected version as well 
 Misc:
 - We currently do not intend to move to Exchange Online
 My current understanding would be that mailboxes also have a version and have to be upgraded. How do I go about doing that? Otherwise, what issue am I not seeing?

                              <span>So with some sadness, my boss and his boss of over a decade, have both resigned in the last two weeks. They&#x27;re both off to bigger and better things, and I wish them well.
 This leaves me and one other Snr Engineer as the sole people in our large Org with the &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;. Eg all the top level access.
 At what point do you trust a new boss with this? Normally with a new peer you would gradually provide more access as it was warranted and you trusted them more. With a boss, that dynmac is quite different.

 Zero Trust CloudFlare Tunnel
 Control Box is running on Port 9090
 Https is enabled from trusting origin in settings of CloudFlare
 Hi all,
 I am new with the whole Cloudflare side of things, so bare with me please 📷
 I have a phone system running iPECS eMG100
 It’s a control box running on my local network. I am trying to use a tunnel to log into it which works as I get the webpage looking for me to log in when i am out and about with my laptop
 I enter the details, and it logs me in but it’s only in “Read Only” mode
 When I log in locally, it logs me in with read / write and I can do the usual.
 I am logging in with the same administrator account with both through the tunnel and locally.
 Did any of you guys ever experience this with your tunnels and web admin panels? Is there some configuration settings that I might have missed in the setup in CloudFlare?

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid thirties and I&#x27;ve just finished being self employed for nearly eleven years. The job I did involved a lot of use of technology, from commissioning and deploying web apps, to building some little internal windows app of my own in autohotkey, to BEING the entire IT department for my small company...
 I&#x27;m ready to work hard and in a dedicated way - but this time for someone else.
 I&#x27;ve done all sorts of different things. I&#x27;m REALLY interested in technology and have been tinkering since I was about ten!
 I have used all sorts of systems over the years from Acorns at secondary school to CentOS now at home (in a homelab type setting). I&#x27;ve provided IT support for paying business/private customers, and have used Unix systems to cobble together working solutions for my own needs as and when.
 I&#x27;ve created/configured/used (these are examples) Asterisk (FreePBX), NodeRed, ESP32 microcontrollers, AutoHotkey, Home Assistant (writing the automations in YAML), Docker, Photoshop, MQTT, Excel.... I have some limited experience with tools such as Cron, SSH, I used to make websites for clients 20 years ago but wouldn&#x27;t have a clue what the in vogue framework is now...
 My IT skills are perhaps beyond 1st line tech support I&#x27;d say (tell me if you disagree!).
 I have an IT related master&#x27;s qualification - but it&#x27;s a few years out of date now, due to the time I&#x27;ve had &#x27;out&#x27; running my own business.
 I&#x27;d need to find somewhere that was willing to take a chance on a quick learner with a MASSIVE interest in tech and a track record of tinkering and experimenting, iterating and building projects.
 Any ideas where to start looking?
 Working remote is absolutely fine for me as I have a garden office at the end of the garden where I can go and just focus for the working day. No distractions.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking for advice, tips, leads at this point. Where should I be looking and how should I be tailoring my CV to (ideally) pivoting towards tech?
 THANK YOU!

                              <span>Our Mac print server recently died (the Mac mini would no longer successfully boot up) so we hurriedly set up a new one with Monterey and the latest Epson print drivers. Individually the printers all work fine but our follow-me print queue just produced a blank page on certain models (we have a mix of WF-C579R WF-C879R and WF-C20600). We raised the issue with PaperCut and they were able to quickly highlight that the cause is that the drivers are outputting ESCP instead of Postscript. 
 I know there&#x27;s a &quot;Generic Postscript&quot; driver on macOS but it&#x27;s my understanding that if we use this we lose access to printer features such as colour profiles, which are important as our Mac users are primarily Art &amp; Photography. 
 Is there a way to configure the Epson print driver on macOS to use / output Postscript?

 Apologies in advance if this is the worst post of the day, but I&#x27;m hoping my sysadmin family of Microsoft experts can help me as I&#x27;m a bit lost.
 Personally, I&#x27;m a Mac admin in a Google workspace environment with comparatively little knowledge of Office 365 other than creating users and licenses in our Office 365 instance for the small number of our team that can only to communicate with clients via Teams/OneDrive etc due to their security requirements.
 I have had a request through from a client to “make sure the external company adds Federation to the following SIP domains…” This in order to facilitate comms over Teams from our company to theirs, rather than the current clunky setup of client VMS / VPN.
 However I can’t find what I’m supposed to be looking for in the admin portal. Google searching tells me it&#x27;s something to do with some settings on our on-prem Skype server, but we obviously don’t have one of those, but that could also be because I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m searching for.
 If anyone has a couple of minutes to point me in the right direction I&#x27;d be super grateful

                              <span>Happy Friday everyone!
 Today I made the troubling discovery of a UPC/APC SC connector mismatch on the demarcation point of my company&#x27;s sole internet circuit. I remember learning that this was a big no no when I was in school, but that cable was installed 3-4 years ago prior to me working here and has remained connected ever since without any noticeable problems (from my perspective, at least), so what exactly are the concerns associated with this improper mating? For reference, the demarc has the APC connector (female) to which our ISP&#x27;s NID connects via a SC/UPC-terminated simplex fiber cable.
 The main reason for my asking is because I&#x27;m about to send a strongly worded email to our ISP telling them to get out here and fix it, but since I&#x27;ve never dealt with this before I don&#x27;t know what expectations I should have as a customer. Do they need to polish the demarc&#x27;s connector before they install the new cable, or should it be re-terminated? Do they need to bring an OTDR out and re-certify the connection? Etc, etc...

 Is this Legit or is there a better way to do this? We&#x27;re thinking about moving away from SSO due to this.

                              <span>As most of us know, IT budgets are often tight and this can result in some fairly cheap tools at the workplace. Is it worth getting some personal tools that are better quality and just bring them in to work when necessary (or as part of edc)?

                              <span>We have much more teams these days that are spread across various locations and are uploading/downloading various source code files etc. 
 Lately we are seeing many issues with reported slow speeds when downloading files. WAN circuit is often 1Gbps using SdWan with the file download speed at 300-400kbps.
 Does anyone have good strategies for dealing with such issues?
 I used iPerf to run a test and this basically confirmed the issue for me. Now I need to figure out why it’s running so slow.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Apologies if this isnt the place for this post, but I am looking for a little bit of career guidance, or even just general options/paths y&#x27;all have taken in your careers in networking.
 A little bit of background on me, and what I currently do:
 I&#x27;m a 28 year old college grad (unrelated major), and currently work for a semi-major bandwidth provider in the Fiber/DWDM space. My day to day job consists of managing new builds, system extensions, grooms, and anything else needed to expand network capacity for new and existing customers. I&#x27;ve been in this role for ~ 3 years, and I&#x27;m somewhat lost on where to go from here. My background in Layer 2 is pretty limited, past a very basic understsanding of BGP/OSPF as it pertains to my current job. I have a lot of interest in learning more on that side of things, but Im unsure how I would go about that. I&#x27;m aware of certs like Net+, CCNA, CCNP etc. but I&#x27;m unusure if that would get me anywhere in network engineering without relelvant experience. 
 I&#x27;m hesitant to apply to NOC, Systems Admin jobs, simply because I would be looking at a significant pay cut (though I understand if that is a route I&#x27;d need to take to get my foot in the door). I also like the space I&#x27;m currently in, but don&#x27;t really know what my future options look like for Fiber Optic/Dwdm related jobs. 
 I&#x27;d love to hear opinions on potential career paths in Fiber/DWDM, and networking, and get some advice on next steps I should take in my career.

                              <span>We use Aruba wirless, clearpass + controllers. We are a bit at a loss. We are told about the problem after the fact and when we attempt to replicate with a variety of devices, we are not able. 
 Problem: A user who has not been on the network previously will attempt to connect to the Guest SSID. This is an open SSID that should load a guest captive portal page. When the user connects, they have no internet and are not able to load the portal page. If the user disables MAC randomization/Private IP address, they have internet and the guest page loads.
 We will keep trying to replicate the issue but I am hoping someone may be able to point us in the right direction or has some similar experiences in the past. Unfortunately it happened during a board meeting and on one informed us or provided us with any information. The problem seems to be very rare.

 We are currently running into issue with Cisco Meraki/OpenDNS setup. We have remote users and connted to internet using Meraki and users are unable to reach some of the site using Chrome/Edge. The users are getting error message like this site is not private and if you continue it will give the Cisco Umbrella &quot;This site is blocked due to content filtering&quot;. The strange part is, the site works fine with Firefox. I looked into cert on chrome and the cert is under Opendns. I tried updating chrome/removed cache and history, installed the cisco opendns root certificate nothing working.

 Looking to purchase some tools for inspecting and cleaning my LC fiber connections at home.
 Can anyone recommend some affordable tools for home user?
 If there is an inexpensive way to get photo of how clean the fiber is that would be great too! But if not manual tools will work.
 Amazon links appreciated but if something good is not available on amazon please still link it!
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey everyone. Scouring the internet and this is my last effort human to human. I’m running BISDN/yocto Linux on a small router. The image I’m currently using is built with FRR 8.2.2. Looking to work some BGP testing in a lab. Our prod devices are using FRR 6.0 so I want to roll back to match. Can anyone point me to a good work up of downgrading?!? I see the different packages and versions in the FRR repository but I can’t find any work up/walkthrough of how to blow away the current load and build back in the older version.
 Very much appreciated!

                              <span>I’m an IT tech and I recently did a project where we connected two switches together that are in separate buildings - about a mile apart. We used single mode fiber all the way through and installed a second line as a secondary. This was pre existing fiber infrastructure, I just patched things into the adjacent dark fiber patch panels to get from point A to point B. The second building is a new building and the patch panels are new. 
 I’m not very well versed in fiber and such but I did do a ping test from switch to switch and got under 1ms responses which I thought was all good. Now Network team conducted a TX/RX optical power test from the switches and found that we’re losing about -10db on the run on both lines and both ways. So right now our RX on both switches is around -13 to -16 db. So my question is, is this normal or is something seriously wrong and what is most likely the cause? The network team is making a big deal out of it and actively trying to make me look like I screwed up their network so I’m not sure how to respond. 
 Any advice appreciated.

 Obviously it&#x27;s Chunkhost and I&#x27;m not expecting an immediate response, but a week is ridiculous. Has anyone been able to reach them? It&#x27;s not a critical server or anything (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t host anything critical with them), but I am paying for a server that&#x27;s currently down and that&#x27;s not ok.
 Alternatively, if anyone has any suggestions for reaching someone over there, I would appreciate it.

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking into Silverfort for adding MFA to our on-prem including our service accounts. Curious what people&#x27;s thoughts are if anybody&#x27;s evaluated them. Also curious how they compare to Crowdstrike&#x27;s IDP module, Authlite, Duo, &amp; smart cards? Seems good (also maybe more coverage than Duo across powershell &amp; psexec) but a bit pricey...
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a folder on a file server(2019) that is shared with some information for an application that a vendor states we should limit user access to as much as possible. So for share permissions I have Everyone full control. For the NTFS permissions I have SYSTEM(FULL), LOCAL ADMINS(FULL), and DOMAIN COMPUTERS(READ). The LOCAL ADMINS group on the file server has domain admins inside of it. Everything is working fine and the application inside of it is being deployed without issue while at the same time no users have any access to the folder except DOMAIN ADMINS.
 Now the strange thing is if I&#x27;m on the file server with my domain admin account and I try to open the folder by either the filesystem or the share I get prompted with the message &quot;You don&#x27;t currently have permissions to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to the folder.&quot; Remember the local admins on the file server has the domain admins in the group. Not sure why it&#x27;s telling me I don&#x27;t have access. Now if I click continue it adds my DA account to the NTFS permissions explicitly. This is screwing up our folder permissions consistency. If I didn&#x27;t truly have access as the message stated how did it explicitly add my DA account with full control? That seems kind of messed up if that was really the case.
 One final note. If I&#x27;m on my office machine and run computer management as my DA connecting the file server and then navigate to the shares, when opening the folder I don&#x27;t get prompted with the message above. If I look at the NTFS permissions everything is correct. WTF? I have to say I&#x27;m confused by this one. I would imagine opening the folder on the file system on the server would be the sure fire way to get in, but remotely accessing it resolves the issue?
 Can anyone explain what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>Hi all, I believe I won&#x27;t be the first one to face this issue but I could not find any answers on the internet. 
 In our company we own about 12 domains, for those domains we have about 20+ SSL certificates (top level, subdomains, wildcard, etc) that are used for services like customer-facing websites, internal ERP systems, teamsconnector, load-balancers in cloud services etc. 
 Those cerficates all expire in different months and it is so hard to keep track of the expiry date, make sure they are renewed, and most importantly-- make sure that the new certificate are sent to the vendor and they update the certificate in time. 
 We have a few occassions when the renewal is missed by internal IT stuff, or the renewed certificate is sent to the vendor but they sit on it until the website goes down.
 Is there any suggestions for how to manage that?

                              <span>I am playing catch-up from the last admin. Freshly documenting everything to a spreadsheet for me. It is not for C-Suite, VPs or Directors to review. I am constantly being asked to send spreadsheets I&#x27;ve made for me, to a VP that should&#x27;ve documented theirselves if they needed the information.
 As per usual at the time, I used to send VP my spreadsheet because &quot;they said to&quot;, then they would subject me to all sorts of suggestions and changes and additions that would make the data kindergarten level understandable(colors, bold, &#x27;move this column here&#x27;, &#x27;add this column for that data&#x27;...etc), to them, but unnecessary if you actually read the information. I already have the bolds, underlines and colors necessary...FOR ME. I have now stopped (stopped sending my documentation, it is on our NAS, only I can edit it. They can read it) since realizing that not sending that data bears no consequences. It&#x27;s a small enough company that anyone in our IT realm could&#x27;ve done this and can do this. This VP also makes it a habit of taking other individuals&#x27; ideas and passing them as their own publicly.
 Has anyone else had an issue where once a VP/Dir knows that you have information useful to them(that they never thought would be before they knew you had it), they commandeer the format of your notes so that it suddenly becomes an involuntary collaborative effort?

There are fiber to Ethernet converters everywhere. The cabling in some of the buildings is thrown together, he had a main connection running through an old t1 punchdown block. It&#x27;s kind of fun figuring and straightening all this out though.

                              <span>Preface - I own a tech shop but we&#x27;re on the hardware side of things.
 I&#x27;m trying to set a client up with Tailscale and RDP so he can securely connect to his office machine and operate quickbooks and all his other software(CPA) through remote desktop. I&#x27;ve got Tailscale set up and working correctly. The problem I&#x27;m running into is authenticating the RDP session. If I open RDC on the client computer and enter the computer name of the host, it brings up an authentication dialogue. He&#x27;s using a 365 account so it&#x27;s already populated, and simply asks for the password. I know I&#x27;m entering it correctly and I&#x27;ve tried multiple times but it&#x27;s reporting the password incorrect. 
 So his MS account is &#x27;firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27;. RDC shows the login as a Microsoft Account &#x27;/firstname.lastname@hisdomain.com&#x27; so I&#x27;m just not seeing the problem here. We have good connectivity obviously as I mis-entered the computer name a couple times and it reported not finding any computers with that name on the network. I&#x27;m already home from my service call to his office but I told him I&#x27;d get to the bottom of it and remote in to make whichever changes deemed necessary by the powers that be - r/sysadmin
 send help.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I made a script to validate MFA on users accounts in Azure AD using the Graph API. It checks if the account is registered with the Microsoft Authenticator app or any 3rd party authenticator app. If the account hasn&#x27;t enabled MFA it will flag them with a date using custom security attributes, and in 7 days if they haven&#x27;t registered MFA it will disable their account. 
 ​
 Just to note I have this disabling the users on-premises account since we&#x27;re assuming they&#x27;re synced users from AD. You can always adjust the script to meet your needs as I have a function in there to disable the users Azure AD account but you will need to stop syncing the accountEnabled attribute in AAD Connect.

 For those who work y NetOps daily operations, how do you handle the high number of alerts received by email?
 I personally have the rule to move them to a separate folder and just look them up in case of an issue arises. The &quot;critical alerts&quot; are not in that rule, they rarely are triggered.

I need to find a price point of an Ekinops ONE2501. I have emailed the company but have yet to hear back anything so just wondering if anyone can shed some light on even just a general idea of a price point. Any input is greatly appreciated! Thank you

                              <span>TL;DR Site is abandoned, automated services to send product codes aren&#x27;t working, and Colby West (owner) is MIA.
 I recently had reached out to Colby via the site&#x27;s &quot;contact&quot; form and via an email I found on his YT account (last video in 2020). I waited a week and no response to my inquiry, so I just went ahead and purchased the eBook.
 Well, the automated email services that send the .ascm file out aren&#x27;t working. Neither are the discount codes for the stencils. Tried reaching out to Colby on LinkedIn - no response and hasn&#x27;t been active in over 2 months. He hasn&#x27;t been active on Facebook since 2015 and Twitter since 2018.
 Currently waiting on PayPal&#x27;s bullshit claim process to get my $50 back.

                              <span>Hi networking gurus -
 I&#x27;m interviewing for a new job next week - managing enterprise deployments using Cisco Meraki and VeloCloud SD-WAN. All my previous networking experience has been in a Juniper and Aruba environment - but I really want this job! Since I have about a week to study, what advice would you have or resources would you recommend for getting an up to speed on Meraki and VeloCloud SD-Wan? I know I could pick the skills up quickly on the job, but I want to show some understanding and knowledge in the interview.

                              <span>Hello everyone, everything good?
 ​
 Can I use 10GBASE-T ports for stacking on the 1960 12XGT JL805A switch. My goal is to have more SFP+ ports for uplinking the servers.
 ​
 Another question, is it good to be used as CORE for a network with about 10 Switch 1960 below it?
