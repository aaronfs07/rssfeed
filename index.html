                              <span>We are looking at moving from our on-premise Mitel/ShoreTel system to RingCentral. We have around 600 users &amp; 20 locations. We continuing to expand globally so a cloud hosted service just makes sense. 
 We have also looking at 8x8 and Teams PBX but RingCentral has made us a very aggressive offer and will be offering native integration into MS Teams without requiring the PBX license or their client software on the computer. It is in open Beta right now with a GA of late May. 
 Is anyone else using RingCentral for 500+ users?

 But, by doing this, the users have to wait before logging in.
 Is there a way to avoid that ?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I´ve had some issues surrounding blocking the access to the admin console to the Dream Machine for a &quot;Guest&quot; VLAN.
 Following many guides and some common sense I have already blocked all access to other VLANs and to the IPs of the Gateway (Dream Machine). Additionally I have blocked all Port 22, 80 and 443 Connections to those IPs, but I can still access every single IP of the Dream Machine.
 ​
 Let´s say I have the
 - IoT VLAN 172.27.0.0/16
 - Default VLAN 172.16.0.0/16 
 Gateways are .1
 ​
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to both Gateway IPs (for testing, since it does not work)
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to ports 22, 80, 443 on both Gateway IPs
 ​
 I still get through to the admin console on the Dream Machine via every IP (172.27.0.1 &amp; 172.16.0.1) whenever I try it from the IoT VLAN :(
 ​
 I would appreciate some help from anybody with some more experience :)

                              <span>Our company recently changed name and with that we got a new email address. We have migrated all emails to the new company name.
 When we search for a email from a specific person, we search for emails from that persons address. The problem is that we don&#x27;t get the emails that were sent before we changed address, it only show emails that were sent with the new address. 
 Weird thing is, in outlook web and on mobile this works fine and we get all emails, even the ones that were sent before we changed address.
 I have tried to create a new outlook profile and rebuild the search index, but i get the same result. Cant find anyone with a similar issue.
 Have anyone experienced something like this before?

 The Shared Mailboxes that were created on prem all have disabled users accounts that are synced with ad connect.
 I stopped syncing a few of these accounts, the EXO mailbox appears to work as normal, but they no longer have accounts in AAD. Unlike Shared Mailboxes created natively in EXO, they all still have accounts in AAD.
 What is the procedure for cleaning this up? I cant find any doco anywhere.

 The &quot;problem&quot; is the banner there:
  
The following documentation was written in 2013 and is provided for historical purposes only. Currently we are reviewing this documentation and it is subject to change. It may not reflect current best practices. 
  
Are this advices still good to follow?
 Furthermore, I know that this question comes up frequently, so I think we could compile a list of best practices and put it on this Subreddit&#x27;s wiki.

                              <span>Long story short, 2 years I used to work as a sysadmin ASSISTANT / SUPPORT but was never given proper training with server management so i lack alot of things. Fast forward today, i got accepted into an animating studio and they seem insistent i start asap by the end of the week. Thinking there was another member, it would be a hand in hand working environment, turns out i will be the sole sysadmin, no one to guide me around their system that im expected to know. My problem comes in when they said they&#x27;ll be outsourcing their work from other countries by offering their pc as a service to them. They want to restrict them from copying data / files from their pc and would only allow them to use the graphic design software. I&#x27;m overwhelmed and i am not sure where to start. Any advise and tips would be greatly appreciated. 
 Also going to setup a home lab, so if you could advise with what softwares to use as well I&#x27;d be more than grateful!

                              <span>So this is a noob problem I guess of a junior that messed up.
 A user of mine suddenly gets the following error when trying to sign in to his domain account.
 the security database on the server does not have account for this workstation trust relationship
 The computer is domain joined but it does not exist anywhere in Active Directory on premises. In endpoint manager, on the other hand, I can find it just fine.
 What would you recommend as a good course of action? Should I remove the computer from the domain, for example, and add it again with the same computer name? If I do that will the user lose access to his domain profile? 
 Any kind of advice is greatly appreciated. Currently there&#x27;s no senior in the company so I&#x27;m afraid to make a wrong move.

                              <span>Hey folks,
 we&#x27;ve run into some strange behaviour at a client&#x27;s DC. They recently moved to another office and finally made the choice to put some money into new server hardware, so we migrated their Srv2016 DC from an old ESXi to a new one. We didn&#x27;t do a V2V (for various reasons) but chose to simply make a final Veeam backup and restored it as a new VM on the new host.
 At first boot the machine went into safemode (with AD repair) as we&#x27;ve expected. So we logged on, changed boot behaviour back to normal and rebooted several times to check if it&#x27;s running correctly.
 Now, ~2 weeks later, users complained they didn&#x27;t have access to a share anymore.
 So we&#x27;ve tried to login on the DC using our Domain Admin user and realised it isn&#x27;t working. Screen says &quot;user can&#x27;t login due to account restrictions or maybe wrong characters in password - as a blank&quot;. That&#x27;s nonsense. So we tried to login using the local admin account and there it says the account would have been deactivated (which isn&#x27;t true either).
 Now we&#x27;re stuck except for having remote powershell access (as system user) with our RMM software.
 I already used it for checking if some safemode has been activated (bcdedit) - which isn&#x27;t the case.
 We also restarted the machine twice yesterday evening. Startup takes ages, but eventually it comes up to the same state.
 Anyone any idea?
 Cheers
 Jay

 Background: I have 2012R2 domain controllers (I know I need to update) with a Windows CA server that is issuing computer certs to client devices. Windows NPS runs 802.1x authentication using the computer certs for auth. None of the aforementioned services share an operating system; each service has their own VM(s).
 So, in the late 2010s when disabling SMBv1 was a priority because of then-recent vulnerabilities, I disabled SMBv1 on all my clients and servers, but apparently not my domain controllers. If I remember correctly, I tried disabling it on the DCs too, but that broke GPO, so I reverted. Back then, I wasn&#x27;t running 802.1x, but the CA server was t…</span>

                              <span>First off, I&#x27;m aware this has been discussed both in this sub and elsewhere on the internet for some time. Problem is, none of the fixes I have found, work.
 We are a smallish org (45 staff) and I&#x27;m preparing to move us to Windows 11 at some point next year, once one of our in house apps is updated from VB4 to .Net and will actually work. We use MDT for reimaging and deployment which happens a handful of times a year. No InTune, we don&#x27;t do cloud.
 My question is... is there a fix that actually works either via Group Policy or preferable PowerShell as part of the task sequence to remove those damn shortcuts? I&#x27;m talking the consumer apps such as TikTok and Spotify.
 FWIW my test rig is on 11 Pro 22H2.
 Also big F**K YOU to Microsoft for including this consumer shit in 11 Pro in the first place!!

                              <span>I work in IT for a global company and we&#x27;ve been having trouble finding a VoIP solution for our internal Helpdesk team (8 agents) whose members are spread across the globe.
 We&#x27;re on Google Workspace and we&#x27;ve looked into using Google Voice but while it allows for international outbound calling, it can only assign US and Canada based Google Voice numbers to our agents (ideally, each agent would have a local VoIP-assigned number for each their respective regions--US, Europe, India--that our internal users can call for IT help without having to make international calls.) We also looked in Zoom&#x27;s &#x27;Zoom Phone&#x27; and while it was better, they don&#x27;t currently support India numbers.
 At this point, we&#x27;ve resigned to the fact there likely won&#x27;t be one VoIP product to cover ever country we&#x27;re looking for but we&#x27;re now thinking maybe a global redirect service might be the way to go--one master toll-free number that will redirect to whoever is on-call.
 Anyone have any suggestions or products to avoid?

However, I would have thought some new products would have come along in the meantime but instead it simply looks like there are less than before. Mine wasn&#x27;t perfectly reliable but it usually got the job done after enough hoops were jumped through. 
 Are there any lesser-known USB crash carts out there or devices that perform roughly the same function these days? Since I&#x27;m mobile I can&#x27;t justify carting around another screen/keyboard/mouse along with my toolbag.

 We are planning to start using that feature. But it ain&#x27;t sending the toast notification when an Admin sends a remote assistance request. Is there a way to push that notification or is it best for us to stay with the teamviewer app?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am facing an unusual issue. We recently acquired a new customer, and unfortunately, their IT personnel have left the company, leaving us with the responsibility of managing their IT infrastructure. Previously, the IT personnel was the main point of contact for everything related to their IT infrastructure.
 Currently, we are facing an issue where the owner of the company has access to only one of the domains&#x27; admin credentials, which he can use to manage the account or manage some of the systems. However, there are two different domains, and we cannot access the second domain controller. Additionally, the infrastructure includes a mixture of Linux and Windows machines with various operating systems, but we only have access to about 10% of that infrastructure due to a lack of credentials.
 For Linux machines, I am planning on resetting the root credentials individually.
 Is there any way for us to gain access to the second domain controller? We have access to their VM host, but we are unable to log in to that particular OS. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

We are a bioscience research nonprofit that competes with the big boys for government grants and contracts. Times have gotten much leaner over the years, as far as bigger grants going out, so when I started, there were about 550 end users, supported by…</span>

                              <span>Our current RDP deployment is using a Server 2016 host as the RD connection Broker, RD Gateway, RD web and RD licensing server. The RD session host role is installed on a different server 2019 host. 
 We have run up a new server 2019 host and are looking to transfer the RD connection Broker, RD Gateway, RD web and RD licensing server roles from the current server 2016 host. After doing some reading, we have found that transferring the RD connection broker role is usually accomplished by configuring a HA cluster, adding the new server to the cluster and then removing the old server. This requires a SQL database and seems like a bit of work. 
 We were wondering if it is possible to install the RD connection broker service on the new server 2019 host, create a new RDP deployment, and then add the existing session host into the new deployment? Would this cause a problem being that the session host is already a part of the old RD collection?
 I have done some reading online and can’t find a straight answer as to whether servers can be a part of multiple RDP collections at the same time or whether they need to be removed from the current collection before being added to the new one. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I’m not enjoying my current work environment, mainly management. I’ve been tossing around the idea of quitting and turning my home into a rental for a little passive income and staying with family or traveling for a bit while I figure out what I want to do.
 I’ve had three jobs in IT and all of them I grew to dislike after some time. The first two, after about 5 years - my current about one year.. It’s to the point where I’ve shared with a coworker or two that I’m thinking of quitting and looking for another job.
 The problem is, I don’t really want another job in IT right now - it’s been soul sucking. I feel like I burned out years ago, I’ve also been dealing with some personal stuff and the stress of IT and the workplace doesn’t help. The thought of hopping from one 8-5 job to another is just depressing. 
 If in six months, a year or two from now I decide to rejoin the IT workforce, would a gap on my resume hurt me?
 I don’t know what I want to do, I just know that I don’t want to keep doing what I’m currently doing. I do have some concerns about leaving a stable job but I’ve not had an issue being hired in the past and it seems like everyone is hiring nowadays.

                              <span>I have had two separate servers both lose their boot cfg after a restart. I was able to restore from backup and had no data loss, but it is still pretty nerve-racking in the moment. It appears to be caused by the Feb 2023 MS Windows update. I am running in VMWare, but it also says it is experienced in bare-metal installs, so it is not limited to VMWare environments.

                              <span>Teams has a new client. Hogs far less CPU and memory says Microsoft. 
 I&#x27;m writing about this and am... curious about a chart in its compare-and-contrast sheet for admins that shows some feature changes between the Teams we know and hate and its lighter weight new version, which is all very welcome. I have a generally fairly well tuned antenna for corporate fuckery though and of particular interest, this comparison in their sheet stands out. 
 &quot;Classic Teams: Ability to add third party cloud storage&quot;
 &quot;New Teams: Use the Teams app from your third party cloud provider to collaborate with files in Teams. Note: Teams admins also can turn off native OneDrive and SharePoint file entry points. Learn more at Turn off Teams nave file upload policy&quot;
 What... exactly is changing here? Very simple wording (hey, add third-party cloud storage!) disappearing into something opaque has me wondering if MSFT is set to make it a lot harder to use third-party cloud storage providers. Anyone more hands-on than me care to have an explore and tell me if I am being unreasonable paranoid and technically illiterate?

 If I am in a group of people being chased by a bear, I only have to run faster than the slowest person in the group. What incentive do I have to help that person run faster? 
 It&#x27;s better for me to let the bears stay busy with the &quot;slow guys.&quot; There will always be bears, and their numbers are finite.
 It&#x27;s a sad and amoral outlook, but nevertheless common.

                              <span>Has anyone ever added custom attributes, specifically for AD users (e.g. Gender, Prefix, ManagerEmail, CostCenter), to their AD environment? I&#x27;ve read quite a bit of things, this MS doc especially, and watched a handful of videos. It seems very simple and straightforward. As long as you don&#x27;t change what is already configured for existing schema objects, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a terribly difficult task. I do have my AD&#x27;s existing OID, so i can follow the MS best practices for addeding .X.X numbers as needed.
 Any experiences or gotchas to share?

As for my university internship, I have to implement a siem in a company network with a microsoft on premise Active Directory. I would like to know what are the main siems that can be implemented to check device logs within this network. I&#x27;ve seen solutions like grayLog and wazuh but I don&#x27;t know if they can be efficient as far as this business case is concerned. Thank you for those who will have the patience to answer me and explain the reasons.

                              <span>Has anyone run into this yet? It is very frustrating for our users. We recently started deploying Windows 11 machines and ran into this issue.
 ​
 If the user sends a print job to our Ricoh MP C3003, then sends another print job before the first one finishes, there is a high change that they receive an error popup and then half the job gets cancelled.
 ​
 I unfortunately do not have the exact wording of the message or where it is coming from. It disappears too quickly for them to get a screenshot. They said it says &quot;Error Printing&quot;, followed by the file name and I think it is popping up from the print task tray icon. There is nothing in the event viewer for these that I can find.
 ​
 None of our Windows 10 boxes are experiencing this issue but all of the Windows 11 machines have at least once. Our printers are on a 2016 print server. We&#x27;ve reconfigured a couple to go directly to the printer instead but that didn&#x27;t seem to help any. I believe it is happening on all of our printers, but the Ricoh is the only one I have log proof of.
 ​
 Googling &quot;Error Printing Windows 11&quot; isn&#x27;t really giving me anything useful as you could imagine. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I just started my sysadmin role a little over a year ago and would like to dig deeper and learn more about Server. I&#x27;ve got some experience in my position building VMs in Server 2019, upgrading from Server 2012 R2 to 2019, and am responsible for monthly patching via WSUS. Maybe that&#x27;s good enough, but I feel like I lack the knowledge when issues do arise with servers.
 What options or resources are out there I can get more in-depth knowledge like a Microsoft Server cert, even if I don&#x27;t get a cert out of it?

                              <span>Hello,
 for my lab I need a cheap SAN solution to create some LUNs and map them to two servers via FC.
 I need these features:
 - RAID Controller supporting RAID5
 - fits SAS HDDs (I have some lying around here)
 - at least 2 FC Ports (2 Gbit should be enough)
 - WebGUI for configuration / creating LUNs etc
 - Price ~500$ without disks
 - At least basic features working without license (I dont need replication, encryption, deduplication etc.)
 Most used/refurbished stuff I found needs some legacy software which has to be licensed. 
 I would be happy for recommendations!
 Thanks
 JCR

 I want to see what licenses and software we have and I can&#x27;t any on SharePoint his email or documentation.
 I can&#x27;t believe we have no av so I ask what&#x27;s a good and relatively inexpensive for a small to mid sized business?

                              <span>Hopefully a nice simple question but we have a customer looking to move to a VoIP phone system (Teams is the preferred option at the moment), however they have a particular requirement for some sort of loud speaker in their Factory, the current system has some sort of configuration so that if the extension in the factory is rung it triggers essentially an alarm buzzer that can be heard over all of the manufacturing equipment. 
 Has anyone come across something similar that might work with Teams or VoIP systems to make the ringer very loud.

                              <span>We are running Microsoft Exchange Version 15.0 build 1497.2 on Windows Server 2012.
 We have an internal mailbox that forwards all emails to a contact on a different domain. So all emails to user@in.com are forwarded to user@out.com. User is a member of a distribution group, group@in.com. So when an email is sent to group@in.com it sends it to user@in.com which then forwards it to user@out.com.
 The error occurs when user@out.com sends an email to group@in.com. It sends correctly to everyone else, but when it tries to forward to user@out.com it sends a 550:
  
user@out.com
 host URL [IP]
 SMTP error from remote mail server after end of data:
 550 permanent failure for one or more recipients (user@out.com:blocked)
  
After testing, it gives the same error when user@out.com directly sends to user@in.com. They receive all emails to group@in.com sent by other users.
 I assume there is some sort of recursive error that flags it as spam because it is trying to forward an email from itself to itself. Other than just having them not use user@out.com to send emails to group@in.com, does anyone have any idea how to fix this?

Luckily, HR called me few days ago and I passed the HR interview and she pushed my application to the hiring manager and I have a phone interview with him in two hours.
 Im kinda nervous since I’ve been wanting to move up from help desk and Im worried I’ll either sound to nervous or I get caught with some difficult questions from him. 
 Any advice or tips?? This is almost double my current shitty IT support salary and my work does not really get acknowledged here.

 I&#x27;ve read that having CA on a DC is a bad idea so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best course of action. Should I stand up another non DC 2022 server, backup the CA and restore the CA on a new server. I&#x27;m standing up new DC&#x27;s and migrated FRS to DFRS but am getting stuck on what to do with this CA.
 Anyone that has migrated the CA off a DC have any tips? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We have a GPO assigned to a RDSH farm to silently login users to the OneDrive app. We use a similar GPO on all user desktops and it works without issue. SSO seems to be working fine on the session hosts, at least in the browser all web apps sign in automatically. And the rest of the 365 suite on the desktop automatically signs in as the user in question with no problem.
 We do have CA policies for users in AAD but the server location in question is set to bypass. I feel like I&#x27;m missing something stupid but I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out for a few days trying to get this sorted.

                              <span>So our Terminal server is an AWS 2022 Datacenter EC2 Instance. We have a user who wants to be able to change their Desktop Wallpaper so we allowed this access and removed the SetWallpaper in the users Startup folder. This worked well and allowed the user to change her wallpaper freely when she wanted to and when she signed out for the day it didn&#x27;t set the default wallpaper the next time she logged in. However, when the server reboots the Setwallpaper script reappears in her user startup folder. I seen this article below, but it doesn&#x27;t seem theirs a way to just remove it completely for EC2 instances besides just manually removing it or creating a script to remove it each time.
 ​
 Anyone know a way to stop EC2 Instances from adding the Setwallpaper script to the user folder?

 For fex days now, our DHCP keep assign multiple IP addresses to our altops causing the saturation of the DHCP leases.

                              <span>Hey guys so I was given the task to redo our company firewall and I&#x27;m not really sure where to start. So currently our fire wall is setup through the use of iptables that were initially created with fwbuilder and edited by hand through out the years (this was all previous to me). Now I&#x27;m not really how to start and what software to use.

Is there official documentation that is specifically covering this topic? Are there ports freely available for apps to use or maybe specific publisher signatures are allowed to use network without warning?

 I used this method (Create Windows 10 ISO image from Existing Installation) to create an ISO file from existing installation and everything works great, I managed to create a custom ISO with lots of software installed on it.
 Now I&#x27;d like to update the system version from 21H2 to 22H2 without reinstalling all the programs that I&#x27;ve already installed manually, is this even possible? If yes, how would I do that?
 Is appreciate any help as this is urgent for me!
 Thank you.

 I&#x27;m trying to include/exclude user (browser version/agent) in our conditional access, but I can&#x27;t find this option.
 Am I missing something or is this not supported? I would expect it to be one of the basics.

                              <span>Mom and pop IT guy here that is bringing us up to speed. We&#x27;re a workgroup, not a domain. We have dedicated RDPs for some users so they can connect to it from different computers if they move around the office.
 In the corner of a storage room we have a bunch of computers stacked up (I know lol). We&#x27;re starting to grow, so I need to consolidate them onto a server. 
 Any advice on what the easiest way to do this is? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 Strugling with OceanStor drives. Due to a sanitization task we have lost usability of some drives with OceanStor storage system. Now system says that can&#x27;t authenticate drives. Asking provider says that a micro code is inserted in these drives and maybe has been wiped out. We have erased other drives for EMC and HPE and we haven&#x27;t had this issue. 
 I am planning to purchase a new OceanStor drive and clone drives but Im not sure if that should work. 
 Has anyone worked with OceanStor systems and has recovered micro code. Should cloning drives resolve the issue?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve hit a bit of a weird issue this morning. Over the weekend all of our devices using the Android/iOS Outlook app were re-quarantined - around 4000 devices. I&#x27;ve checked and the rule for quarantine hasn&#x27;t been amended recently which was my initial thought. Is there a way I can track what caused it? Going through the MSExchange Management Event Logs, I can see events for when I have re-approved the devices but nothing for the quarantine.
 Looking further into the logs, it appears all the devices are being detected with a different DeviceId.

                              <span>Currently racking my brain over the following.
 Since last week or so, our end users have been getting automated emails from microsoft 365, stating emails have been put in quarantaine. These mails are all legit, but we want to stop sending these emails to the end users.
 Ive had a dig through the m365 security section, and changed up the anti phish, spam, and malware policies to use the &#x27;adminonlyaccesspolicy&#x27;, which does not send emails to the end users, but to no avail apparently. 
 Anyone able to point me in the right direction?

                              <span>I have an attachment filter rule on my M365 tenant that Quarantines HTML attachments, as the overwhelming majority are phishing messages. There was a previous edge case that allowed attachments with trailing periods to bypass the rule, which with the help of some redditors I solved with a little regex (see this archived thread). My successful rule looks like this in the M365 Exchange Admin:
 Apply this rule if Is received from &#x27;Outside the organization&#x27; and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: &#x27;\.htm\.$&#x27; or &#x27;\.html\.$&#x27; or &#x27;\.inetloc\.$&#x27; or &#x27;\.htm$&#x27; or &#x27;\.html$&#x27; or &#x27;\.inetloc$&#x27; 
 But now I&#x27;m seeing another edge case where attachments with encoded filenames are also bypassing the rule. I determined that the encoding for .htm and .html are &quot;odG1s?&#x3D;&quot; and &quot;odG0&#x3D;?&#x3D;&quot;, so I added them to the rule, but they are still getting through:
 Apply this rule if Is received from &#x27;Outside the organization&#x27; and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: &#x27;\.htm\.$&#x27; or &#x27;\.html\.$&#x27; or &#x27;\.inetloc\.$&#x27; or &#x27;\.htm$&#x27; or &#x27;\.html$&#x27; or &#x27;\.inetloc$&#x27; or &#x27;odG1s?&#x3D;$&#x27; or &#x27;odG0&#x3D;?&#x3D;$&#x27; 
 The email source looks like this:
 ----&#x3D;&#x3D;_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585 Content-Type: application/html Content-Transfer-Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Disposition: attachment; Filename&#x3D;&quot;&#x3D;?UTF-8?B?NjUzNC5odG0&#x3D;?&#x3D;&quot;  document.write(unescape(&#x27;&#x27;)); ----&#x3D;&#x3D;_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585-- 
 Any ideas on how to get the existing rule to recognize these types of attachments? Or do I just need to write another one that looks at the Content-Disposition header separately, not depending on Microsoft&#x27;s interpretation of it?

                              <span>Hello there,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to implement Microsoft recommended rules to block TCP445/SMB connections.
 We have VPN set up, to connect to Azure Wirtual Network (our whole domain structure is in Azure).
 So i created a GPO with the following firewall rules:
  
 Block all inbound SMB 445 (made no changes here)
  Block outbound Guest/Public SMB 445 (made no changes here)
  Allow outbound Domain/Private SMB 445 (changed Remote Port to Local Port and Scope Remote to Scope Local and typed in virtual network address range)
  Block outbound Domain/Private SMB 445 (changed Remote Port to Local Port)
 Security connection rules (made no changes here)
  
Gpupdate /force works fine, so i guess its all good? Did i do that correctly?
 ​
 Also thinking about Network security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain.
 I&#x27;ve been tracking NTLM\Operational in event viewer, but there are no logs.
 Does that mean i can set the value to one of the Deny ones?
 ​
 Please keep in mind I&#x27;m a newbie, thank you.

                              <span>We have more than one Helpdesk instances in our company. A user can log a call by sending an email to the Helpdesk address communicated within the company as a result a ticket will be created automatically by the Helpdesk system. Let me say we have Helpdesk1@sysadmin.com for IT, Helpdesk2@sysadmin.com for finance etc. Here’s the problem: Some users will send an email to Helpdesk1, for an IT issue but they’ll cc helpdesk2. This as a result will create 2 tickets on both the IT and finance system. And will also notify finance and IT about the ticket even though it’s not needed. Is there a way to create a rule on Exchange to restrict users to be able to send to one address only at once and not to both at the same time? NB: We always educate our users not to send to both Helpdesk addresses at once since each serves a different purpose..

                              <span>Long story short, the CEO of a company I work for (for now) fired all the infosec staff (2 people) and now as soon as he did that he wanted to implement a BYOD policy which I said is a terrible idea. I’ve mentioned that it would be difficult to stop accidental or intentional downloading of data, if they have viruses on their phones they can infiltrate the company.
 How do I make the policy so tight that no one will want to use a personal phone (I know some still may try without adhering to it but at least that way it’s their fault for not being complaint). If anyone has any examples or templates they can share that would be great.
 The boss in question was hacked previously and still wants to go ahead with this is, and he tends to blame whoever he can even if they have no involvement in an issue. I’ve chosen to stop saying no directly to him because I’ve realised I could have been fired for this after seeing they way he has treated other staff and of course… he is friends with the CEO and CFO.
 And yes resumes have been flying and I may leave soon but just in case I stay I want to have a plan B.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve planned to take a few Microsoft certifications however when i went to look at most of them, last friday specifically Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer(MCSE) it says &quot;This certification has been retired&quot; 
 Did they update the certification and calls it something new today?
 When browsing their othe exams and certifications it says the same on the other exams &quot;This certification has been retired&quot;
 Are there better alternatives or can i find equivalent certifications or exams to match it?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 Not sure if to post this to the Intune subreddit or here. Having some issues on some machines where opening a CMD as administrator and calling setup.exe /S (for example) will work fine but opening CMD using psexec as system which I think is similar to how Intune installs applications (as system) just causes it to find no file found or throw errors.
 Setup runs fine on the local machine as administrator but in intune getting file not found on some devices.

 Has anyone experienced anything similar have any ideas? Running Defender with the baseline policy. 
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 do any of you have experience with how many thousands of TCP connections we should expect at our central proxy when we roll out M365 (Teams, OneDrive, Sharepoint Online, Exchange Online etc.)? For regulatory reasons, we may not route traffic past the proxy (as Microsoft recommends).
 I realize it&#x27;s difficult to give an exact number but maybe someone of you has some experiences with concrete numbers (amount users -&gt; amount TCP conncection in average/peak during the day).
 Best regards

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m looking for a solution to export all mailboxes from an old Exchange 2003 server to PST files. The problem is that the total size of all mailboxes is around 900GB, and I&#x27;ve tried using the ExMerge tool, but it has a limit of 4GB.
 Does anyone have any ideas for how I can export these large mailboxes to PST files? Are there any other tools or methods I could try that can handle this amount of data? 
 Thank you!

My new role, in government, needs a little more, attention and formality.
 What do you folks use to write out your project scopes and manage them? How do you present them?
 I appreciate your wisdom!

 Nothing has changed, in fact our servers are due for a patch cycle this coming tuesday. Outside of us reconfiguring some accounts that backup exchange we can&#x27;t find anything wrong. AND yes for you smart asses...we did revert those backup service accounts just in case the engineer who set them up made that account tied with exchange in some funky way lol

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have problem with configuration NVME over ROCE on vSphere 7.0.3. My storage is Huawei Dorado 3000 v6 and network card is Intel(R) Ethernet Controller E810-XXV for SFP which supports NVME over ROCE. I installed the latest update, for Icen version 1.11.3.0, irdman 1.4.3.0 and for Huawei Dorado 6.1.5. I made the configurations based on the Huawei guide. ROCE interface are connected directly to the server. The ports have VLAN 55 for controller A and VLAN 56 for controller B. I created logical ports to which I assigned physical ports. On vSphere I created virtual switches for each VLAN, next created storage adapters with NVME over RDMA. The problem occurs when I try to connect the controller. When I type IP Address, vsphere finds nothing. Has anyone had a similar problem or know what else I can do?

                              <span>Hi all, we have a need for users in our factory to communicate with one another regularly. We have: -30 devices running Windows 10, acting LIKE kiosk devices -Automatic logon with local account -40 users using these devices coming and going and switching devices -No users with M365 licenses -Proprietary manufacturing software loaded -Isolated network
 How would you go about providing a solution? Could use teams but that would mean assigning each user a license and signing in and out whenever they come and go which is not nice.
 Would rather not use a third party IM app that one would have to sign up for.
 Anyone have a similar situation?

 Thinking about upgrading my controllers to 20.9.2. They are currently on 20.8.1 which is a short term release train. I have to be on 20.7+ since I need the CUBE features. 
 What versions are you running in your deployments and what features are you using?

                              <span>I have been trying to read into and learn more about ROADM operation, but I can’t seem to find the answer after some research. Sometimes it seems like obvious questions are the hardest to find the answers. 
 In theory, can ROADMs support 10G, 100G, etc simultaneously since its just manipulating the light? Or are there some real world limitations that require it to operate at a single rate. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi I have a Watchguard T30 in Western Australia and a Checkpoint Quantum Spark in Melbourne. 
 Checkpoint is at the head office and Western Australia is a branch. 
 In Western Australia, the internet is vdsl so it’s being bridged from ISP modem/router to the Watchguard. 
 When we do a site-to-site vpn between the two it works fine but after about 30 min it breaks the connection. I changed the renegotiate from 8 hours to 12 hours it lasted around 3 hours. 
 Does anyone know what’s happening and how to fix this ?

 Will it be a switch that you can tell how to configure in laymans terms? Will it be AI on wireless access points (kinda like Juniper Mist)? Or will it be something else entirely?

                              <span>Hi,
 So I think I&#x27;ve got the backend concept of VXLAN down now at about 95% understanding.
 The Overlay I see as the easier part, VTEP sends a BUM or unicast packet to the other VTEP with the right VNI in, from there, the VTEP that recieves it will look in its database for that VRF/VNI depending on if its a L2 or L3 VNI and then forward onto the correct VRF and end device
 The main confusion left is how different underlay routing combinations work and interact with eachother.
 So far, this is how I see it. And please either feel free to totally correct me or can you please verify if I&#x27;m right as well.
 For data plane flood and learn, it&#x27;s multicast on the underlay, using a combination of OSPF (an IGP) to distribute the RP addresses everywhere, and multicast to send out the packets to the R…</span>

                              <span>We have a pretty simple network, and Im curious why I might see fairly regular ping spikes to the core switch IP (default gateway). This is &quot;enterprise&quot; hardware.. this is happening in multiple locations (even small office with only 20 folks in it. Networks arent overly busy (people accessing 1-30meg files on file server).
 If my default gateway is 172.16.1.1 and I ping it with -t, I&#x27;ll see 95% of pings &gt;1ms, but the occasional spike to 80ms for two or three lines...

                              <span>Im curious as to why a traceroute in a relatively simple network would take two different paths randomly on each traceroute. When I say relatively simple, I mean, VMware server connected to core switch, connected to firewall, out to internet, nothing like VRRP or other tech.
 Windows Server IP: 172.16.1.10
 Server default route: 172.16.1.2
 Its Default Gateway: 172.16.1.2 (Core switch)
 Firewall: 172.16.1.1
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 9.9.9.9
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to mail.google.com
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8 
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Why would some trace&#x27;s hit the core switch (default gateway), and some hit the firewall directly first? Again no other tech is in place... No VRRP, no routing protocol (OSPF, etc), Other than the physical server is connected to the core switch with LACP. 
 The core switch (router) only has one route, and that is its default route of throwing everything at the firewall 
 0.0.0.0 172.16.1.1
 Physical Dell server, connected to Aruba Switch, Connected to Palo Alto Firewall.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m looking for someone to point me in the right direction. I&#x27;ve been searching for a while now and can&#x27;t find an explanation for what I&#x27;m seeing.
 I have two Cisco ASR-9904 routers. One of them is allowing me to implement OSPF configurations. The other one is not.
 See screenshots here.
 I&#x27;m not sure why one is allowing OSPF to be configured, but the other isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not super experienced with IOS-XR, so sorry if I&#x27;m missing something obvious to a lot of you. As far as I know, there is no way to enable or disable features on IOS-XR, like how you can with NX-OS. They are both running the same licenses (no licenses). I did not originally set up the working one, so I&#x27;m not sure if anything special was done to get OSPF working. It was set up several years ago. I am however tasked with setting up this second ASR.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Good morning/afternoon/evening !
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out a routing issue I&#x27;m having with an Adtran / NetVanta router.
 I must have had a big bowl of stupid for breakfast this morning, since I&#x27;m still kind of scratching my head as to the source of the problem.
 See attached image for a rough block diagram for the network. . .
 https://i.imgur.com/INbKpWO.jpg
 I have an overload rule set for VLAN3, with a traffic selector of 172.55.0.0 /22 to permit any.
 From the PC, I can ping the VLAN1 IP address on the Adtran, at 172.55.0.222.
 I can also ping a few of the print servers on the 172.55.x.x subnet.
 I can&#x27;t ping the 172.55.1.1 gateway, or the 172.55.0.200 switch.
 Nor can I reach any of the 172.55.x.x devices via http or telnet, including the ping-able print server devices.
 PCs attached to the switch can of course reach everything on 172.55.x.x, since they are pointed to the 172.55.1.1 gateway for that network.
 I&#x27;ve tried next-hop routes, such as 172.55.0.0 / 22 &gt; 172.55.1.1 but that didn&#x27;t help. 
 Do I have my overload rule backwards? I have a feeling it&#x27;s something really basic, and I&#x27;m just spacing on the problem completely.
 Any assistance would be appreciated.
 Note: I cannot add any routing rules, or otherwise change the router at 172.55.1.1

                              <span>AnyConnect client as subject 4.10.06079 predeploy k9 on Ubuntu 20.04 derivate- however same problem on Manjaro 22.0.4.
 Recently multi-factor authentication was activated remote network side - LAN one wants to connect using AnyConnect to.
 To establish VPN to remote network doesn‘t work in the fashion the window pupping up to conduct 2FA- authentication flashes for just fraction of second then disappears from screen. This way user gets no chance to enter and complete multi-factor authentication.
 Is this a known problem pattern? Where to look for possible root causes?
 Let me know please if more details regarding setup in use are needed.
 UPDATE
 I missed to mention one detail. Whole procedure to establish VPN connection completes with other pop-up: Authentication failed due to problem verifying server certificate. Indeed that prob of server certificate verification I have to live with for months, since long before MFA has been introduced network side. Is this possibly the track I have to follow?
 Client side network config actually as delivered by Linux distribution in use. Please note it is about two independent Linux nodes (well, they share however virtualization host). I can‘t talk about network/authentication config remote network side.
 UPDATE II
 CISCO AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client app installer was downloaded from remote network operator. Last available version in use.
 UPDATE III
 Regarding server certificate verification failure I communicated this to organization IT many months ago. However up to this minute no, or incompetent yet upon heavy delay answers.

                              <span>I have a 500Mbps fiber connection at one site via a Nokia gpon modem router with lan range 192.168.1.0/24 and then I connected my router to the lan port of the gpon to get lan IP range 192.168.30.0/22 thru which about 200 clients connect via APs across the facility. 
 The problem is the ISP doesn&#x27;t allow me to setup my own modem and must use their modem plus they also refused to put the Nokia modem/router in bridge mode. 
 One issue I have been facing is that the Nokia modem hangs every 3-5 days... a simple restart fixes it but not the type of solution I want especially considering that every time it is down I recieved 50 calls!! Isp replaced the modem 3 times but with the same model and after a few months starts hanging.
 What are the possible issues that I may face in this type of setup? What do you guys recommend? 
 Any suggestions apart from taking the ISP tomcourt..

                              <span>Hi,
 Sorry if this isn&#x27;t the right place to ask about this, I want to rearrange and help declutter our network racks for the company I work for.
 Basically the person that set them up is no longer with the company so I have no idea how it was all set up or what the credentials are for the network switches/firewalls. We have a Gigabit fibre leased line. We also have some Dell SonicWalls, TP Link managed switches and a PowerDSine 6548 POE.
 There&#x27;s ethernet connectivity spread out across about 8 rooms.
 I&#x27;ve only dealt with personal networking, not enterprise, so I feel like I may be a little out of my depth here, just want to see what your thoughts are and what you would do in my position?
 Edit - Thank you so much for everyone&#x27;s answers, I will follow the main advice you gave which is to not touch it and try to get an IT professional to come. Thanks again 😀

                              <span>I have an HP 5400zl that is in need of a new CF card. I put a new CF card in and it boots to the LAN Monitor where I copy a &quot;new&quot; version of the switch firmware to it through xmodem. The switch is booting with ROM version 15.30 and I&#x27;m loading 15.15 on it which is compatible with the Boot ROM.
 The upload always fails. I get this error
 You have invoked the console download utility. Do you wish to continue? (Y/N)&gt;Download was successful. -- Download for this Product, proceeding -- Compact Flash is not detected. Download is aborted. Ready for code execution. ERROR: Download was unsuccessful. 
 I&#x27;ve tried different CF cards. I&#x27;ve formatted them as FAT from my Windows machine, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure the switch understands that. There is a format command in LAN Monitor, but it doesnt seem to do anything or I&#x27;m using it wrong. I create a blank directory and then try &quot;format cfa0&quot;, &quot;format /cfa0&quot; or &quot;format cfa0/&quot; the directory is still there.
 What am I doing wrong here?

I’ve Been Trying To Get A Job In This Field But It Seems Almost Impossible Right Now. These Companies Seem To Only Want 5 Plus Years Of Experience (But If I Can’t Get A Job How Am I Supposed To Have). Is Net+ Not Enough For Even A Entry Level Tech.

                              <span>Is it possible to authenticate a new router when it connects to a network? could 802.1x be used? (could a router be an 802.1x client too?)
 I know that the router could have the authenticator role in 802.1x to authenticate a supplicant client (end-user). Can a router be a supplicant client of another router? 
 Is there any other way to do router authentication?

                              <span>Hi there.
 We are in the process of migrating our O365 Licensing from E3-&gt;Business Premium to take advantage of the additional security features available.
 We have had E3 for a number of years now, and probably 10% of our users are affected by the reduction of mailbox size from 100GB-&gt;50GB. 
 We currently do not have any archive policies in place, but I wonder how other companies deal with archive/large mailboxes after a user has departed the organization.
 Typically, when we offboard a user - we convert the mailbox to shared mailbox, and remove the license. But documentation indicates that shared mailboxes are limited to 50gb. Historically, when we would offboard a user who&#x27;s mailbox is bigger than 50GB, we would add in an Exchange E2 license to allow access to the mailbox.
 If we DID have an archive policy in place, presumably after we converted the users mailbox to a shared - the archived mailbox would disappear at some point?
 These discussions happening as we determine the best path our our existing LARGE mailboxes (who are licensed with E3) - that we want to get licensed for Business Premium. Initial thought is toss on a Business Premium AND an E2 as a top up to 100GB - BUT the Business Premium licensing DOES allow for very large archiving... But - what happens when that person leaves the org?

                              <span>Can’t seem to find the documentation anywhere I’ve searched. I’m trying to understand how frequently a browser would check in for any changes done to a pac file and apply such changes e.g change of routes or exit proxies etc when such changes are made to the pac file. Sniffing a network adapter with wire shark, I can see the pac file being requested fairly frequently but the changes to the proxy pac file doesn’t seem to take effect until a few hours. Does anyone under this behaviour?

                              <span>Just like the title says. I have a fear of something catastrophic happening and being unavailable. One of my main responsibilities is being a server admin for a k12 district. We have survived ransomware several years ago and my responsibilities have only grown since then. I know for my own mental health I have to disconnect and leave work at work but it can be difficult sometimes with a looming fear that some hacker out there wants nothing more than to destroy everything that we’ve built. I was just wondering how some of you deal with this type of thing as I know it is common in our field. Be safe out there and take needed time for yourself and your family life. Burnout is real.
 Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice and kind words. It’s tough out there and things can be stressful at times so prepare the best you can to deal with situations when they happen. The best option being to have shared knowledge and responsibilities. Backup what’s important and document everything that would help in the event of a disaster. Don’t shoulder the burden alone. A job is not worth your mental health. Stay safe out there and take care of yourselves.

                              <span>What is the correct migration path forward? I tried to follow online documentation, and it brings me to Azure AD Connect which must run on server 2016 or newer. I have hundreds of users, so would like to do this in a hybrid setup, where I can have some users in O365 and some on Exchange 2013 while migration is in progress.

                              <span>Looking for hardware recommendations to support the following:
 Multi-building campus with both the standard corporate and guest wifi networks - easy
 Standard corporate lan throughout - easy
 Personal Access Networks - where it gets tricky
 We have about 300 guest rooms where we want to provide a unique PAN per room so guests can wireless print, Chromecast to their TVs, utilize Airplay; without any cross communication to any other network. Additionally, in some of the PANs we want to provide wired Ethernet connections for guests to plug devices in.
 We have this working with dedicated APs and switches and an extensive VLAN configuration through Ubiquity but we’ve had several of their BS firmware issues causing the whole network to drop off, loss of DHCP etc.
 Hardware - 100 switches, 300 APs for varying supported models from Unifi
 We have some installations with Fortinet; but have had strange FortiLink issues that have me concerned for larger deployments.
 What do you think?

                              <span>So I had the privilege of taking a look through our annual PCI self-assessment quiz that our security team fills out. I had no idea how far out of compliance we were! But to maintain our PCI eligibility, they&#x27;ve been answering all these questions in the affirmative year after year.
 These are not &quot;grey area&quot; questions or things that could be plausibly misunderstood. These are things that we clearly, tangibly do not do or have in place. The costs and turnaround time for putting this all into place would be enormous.
 So now I&#x27;m wondering, is this par for the course? Is PCI compliance just a dance where companies nod their head during interrogation and then roll over and take their beating if they ever do happen to get breached? Do the security people signing off on this ever get charged with fraud?
 Not really any of my business, I&#x27;m not responsible for filling out this form or evidencing the claims, but holy cow...

                              <span>My family owns a small automotive repair shop which has a simple invoice that customers fill out. It includes name, address, license #, car make/model/mileage, date and then an itemized list of repairs &amp; parts used. I&#x27;m looking into options to go paperless such as filling that information out on a tablet or computer and being able to quickly search/find the invoice at a later date. Ideally also be able to extrapolate the data (total billed, costs of parts) for taxes/accounting. 
 Currently we have someone that inputs the accounting data from invoices into excel each quarter for the accountant and it takes about 2 weeks for 3 months of invoices. Occasionally we need to find an invoice, usually to provide another customer copy, which could takes a few hrs to find since we don&#x27;t know what day…</span>

                              <span>I have two different Linux boxes providing SMB shares and find myself copying large files between them very often.
 When I do so, data goes from the source server to my client in memory and then to the destination server.
 Is there a way of getting samba to push data from the source server to the destination without involving the client, like in FXP when they have separate storage backends?

                              <span>Seeing this on two HPE Gen10 plus servers now with Windows 2022. Build a new HPE server + e208i-p card with a primary raid that is SSDs (RAID1 or RAID5) and a secondary raid of hard drives (RAID 5). Third party enterprise class drives. Windows Server 2022. Systems have a TPM.
 I can encrypt the boot drive (SSD raid) with Bitlocker no problem. When I go do this with the secondary raid (HDDs) it is coming up as a removable drive and asking for Bitlocker to go. Need to make it a fixed data drive so that I can encrypt the drive with the TPM. 
 Done this successfully many times in the past up to Server 2019. Reformatted one of these with server 2019 and get the same issue. Latest SPP on both systems. 
 What on earth am I missing???

 ​
 I called him and went over his machine, great machine, I7gen11, 16g RAM. Chrome is eating a lot of mem, the idiot installed steam and other stuff on it, but besides that, works just fine.
 ​
 &quot;No!&quot; He insisted, &quot;the memory is on 40% when I turn the PC on!&quot;
 ​
 Dude you should say thank you! Some machines I&#x27;m working with use double that!
 ​
 Anyway, he wants me to disable the AV to get some more CPU out (It wasn&#x27;t even on the top 15 apps in the task manager, but whatever).
 ​
 I play around with the management console, do nothing and promise him it&#x27;s OK now.
 ​
 5 minutes later his manager calls and asks what I did, b/c his PC suddenly flies!
 ​
 I couldn&#x27;t lie to the manager, but he&#x27;s cool and LOL&#x27;ed about it hard.

                              <span>Hi!
 First of all, this is my first time posting here so I don&#x27;t know if this is the right way to do it.
 I am trying to set up a PC for public use. Specifically, for an interactive art installation. What I am going to present is a &quot;trojan&quot; (not malicious) written in .VBS that takes control of the system and displays visual content as if it were a movie. The thing is that since I want to maintain the interactivity, being a public space, I need to isolate somehow the system and restrict unwanted activity (avoiding having to go to repair it continuously).
 I had thought about Microsoft&#x27;s Kiosk mode, but I have Windows Home and I can&#x27;t use it. With this, I thought of virtualizing a machine, but if the software crashes I don&#x27;t know how I could automate the execution. Finally, I thought of using an isolated user and through UAC limit its range of action, but I don&#x27;t know.
 What do you think? I can&#x27;t find the solution.
 Thanks!

 How can I clean them up? 
 If I install new operating systems, what are the chances that there will still be malware hiding somewhere? Or is it better to dd /dev/sda etc with zeros? Or perhaps erase via bios if available? 
 Does OS rewrite the whole disk or there is a good part outside OS and boot partitions?

                              <span>Is it true that a UPS must match or exceed the PSU watt input rating due to a temporary spike that occurs when switching from AC to battery mode?
 I&#x27;m trying to buy a pure sine wave UPS for my computer that has a 850W aPFC PSU. I use the computer as both a home server, dev environment, and gaming a few hours a month. It&#x27;s a 16-core 7950X with a 3070 RTX.
 I only use about 250-300W during usual non-intense loads, and do not need an 850W UPS, so not sure whether I need to overspend here and get 900W UPS, or if a good quality 500-600W line interactive Eaton with pure sine would be enough.
 I don&#x27;t want to get in a situation where the computer would power off when the power is out.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say you have company A and Company B both using Azure AD.
 Company B buys Company A and you want to move the users over from A to B. I&#x27;ve found several articles on how to move the mailboxes, the VM&#x27;s, the storage, etc., but not the users themselves. I have found 3rd party applications that say they&#x27;ll do it, but they just recreate the user and technically don&#x27;t move them. 
 Does anyone have a way to do this with AAD GUI or Azure PS?

                              <span>Here is a little background about me. A couple of years ago I graduated with an MIS degree (jack of all trades, not specialized in any), and got a helpdesk position for 1.5 years as of now with zero experience in IT cause I had no idea what I wanted to do. The hiring person (who is my lead) in the company gave me the opportunity even when I had zero experience whatsoever. I had the opportunity to learn how to do some basic helpdesk stuff like troubleshooting, push software via SCCM, image/reimage laptops, intune, exchange admin center, active directory, etc.
 A month ago, the infrastructure manager saw me at the front desk and came up to me and we kind of sparked a conversation about what I wanted to do, work goals, etc. I told him I wanted to work on cloud stuff, especially AWS, and how I loved the company. He came back a couple of weeks to the front desk and told me to apply for a sys admin position for his team in the same company that just got posted. So, I did and here I am now for an interview opportunity for this position. 
 I guess what I&#x27;m trying to figure out is how to do I go about this interview, this is something I want to do and I&#x27;m very anxious and nervous about how to approach this interview because I have limited interview experience:
 Here are some of the tasks, the role will be doing:
 • Performing daily operations and maintenance of the Enterprise Server infrastructure. This infrastructure includes VMWare, Windows Servers, Active Directory, File and Print Management, System Center Configuration Manager, SharePoint, SQL, Nagios, Rubrik, and Ansible. 
 • Working with engineers across the enterprise to ensure that the Company&#x27;s servers and workstations are patched and upgraded in a timely manner. 
 • Helps develop solutions, design, and system architecture. 
 • SCCM Administration • Dell/EMC – VXRails maintenance and upgrades 
 • VMWare Workspace One and Horizons Administration 
 • Active Directory Administration 
 • Azure and AWS

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently been hired by a MS shop to manage their Linux server fleet. The company makes use of MS Teams, and the entire Office365 ecosystem so I&#x27;ll be stuck using Windows on my workstation. (Traditionally in this type of role I&#x27;d use Linux as my OS, I like my environment to match production settings.) 
 So starting from a clean slate, would you use WSL(2) or a full HyperV VM as your &#x27;home&#x27; to interface with a linux server fleet? 
 WSL would be easiest, but a VM would be most comprehensive. I&#x27;d like to hear you opinions.

                              <span>Hi, Reddit team.
 Our organization is planning to procure firewalls to enhance our security posture. We are considering two options:
  
Using a big-size Palo Alto firewall with multiple virtual contexts each for perimeter, data center, internal segmentation, and internet-facing DMZ or
 Implementing multiple layer firewalls from different vendors - one for the perimeter network and DMZ, and another for the data center and internal segmentation.
  
Our goal is to control both data center east-west traffic and south-north traffic from the client to the data center. We want to ensure that our chosen solution provides the best security and flexibility for our organization.
 I would like to hear from the community regarding their experiences and recommendations for firewall solutions. What are the pros and cons of each option, and what are the potential challenges and considerations that we should be aware of before making a decision?
 Thank you in advance for your insights and contributions to this discussion.

                              <span>I recently discovered AsterFusion and have been doing some research on them and their offerings. They appear to be legit and offering fairly high-level equipment but despite my best google-fu I can barely find anything about them let alone in English.
 I&#x27;m hoping that someone here either has some experience with them or knows someone that does. I&#x27;d love to hear what they&#x27;re like to work with, if their equipment and switch OS (customized version of SONiC) live up to specs/promises, etc.

However, I don&#x27;t have any certifications, and I was added to the senior engineering team at this company. It felt like ( and still sometimes does ) I&#x27;m underqualified for the position. I was told my hiring manager a big reason I was selected for the role was outstanding soft-skills but I feel like for my current role I&#x27;m lacking a bit in more technical areas. Most of my coworkers on my team are senior Network Engineers with 15-20+ years on me, and while I&#x27;m learning practically every minute, I feel like I want to pursue a certification of some sort to solidify my skills. I also want something to increase salary potential down the road. Right now, being part of the LAN team, I deal mostly with L2 &amp; L3 switching and I enjoy it. I&#x27;m considering studying for the CNNA and eventually CCNP. I also work closely with a CCNP and his knowledge and experience troubleshooting at the packet level is something I&#x27;m aspiring too. Given all this, do you think my time and effort be better spent studying for something else?

 My question is, does it work?
 Did anyone have an AP delivered at their doorstep automagically?

                              <span>I was searching about difference but still didn&#x27;t get it. So both of them loop around multiple queues and let high priority traffic be forwarded, primarily. But CBWFQ guarantees minimum bandwidth for each queue. Well, I doesn&#x27;t WRR do it as well? S there&#x27;s where confusion arises. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m Goin to implement segment routing with Isis in my network and I need to make a pseudowire to connect to switches in two different regions. I&#x27;m trying to simulate it all in gns3 and I&#x27;m using two Asr9001 with ios-xrv 6.3.x to establish the evpn pseudowire, each one has a physical interface as l2transport to connect to the locale switch. 
 Unfortunately the traffic doesn&#x27;t flow between the two switches, despite the pseudowire is up on both sides... Am i missing something? Do you knwo if there are compatibility issues on ios-xrv? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>At my place of work, generally every year I do something to improve network security.A couple of years ago it was to enable DHCP Snooping, last year it was ISE (still being tuned and causing occasional support tickets) and deployed Rapid PVST+ with portfast admin-edge to better allow PXE boot to still work.
 This year, I intend to implement Port Security. My entire network is 90% Cisco and will become 100% Cisco (other than Palo Alto firewalls). It is pretty much all 9300-48P-E units.
 ​
 At any rate here is my plan (feel free to make corrections/suggestions):
 On the edge ports to the users only (not uplink/downlink ports), I am planning to implement a basic port-security and allow for six (6) dynamically learned MAC addresses because a phone and a PC take two (2) MAC addresses. We don&#x27;t …</span>

But I think it is relevant to our sysadmin/tech related job so I decided to post here anyway. I know there&#x27;s a lot of topic of ranting about being a sysadmin, but this isn&#x27;t one of them :)
 I have been in IT related jobs since high school, working summer jobs as tech support for small shops and then eventually moving up to Sysadmin after college. I never started my career in Helpdesk, started right off the bat as a Junior Sysadmin. As a career, I&#x27;ve been working as a Sysadmin for the past 15 years at 3 different employers.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;m a sysadmin at a few schools, and I&#x27;m trying to deploy a GPO to restrict EXE games which the students appear to be running from their desktops. I essentially followed this guide:
 https://blogs.manageengine.com/corporate/general/2018/10/25/application-whitelisting-using-software-restriction-policies.html
 I&#x27;ve got a test OU with a Software Restriction Policy deploying. I&#x27;ve got my computer in there and also a user. I&#x27;ve tested SRP under User and also Computer and can confirm the GPO is reaching the machine.
 However, weirdly it seems as if none of the path rules are doing anything? I&#x27;ve explicitly blocked several paths and extensions (EXE&#x27;s, MSI&#x27;s, BAT&#x27;s, etc) and as the user, I can run BAT&#x27;s and EXE&#x27;s with no worries whatsoever. The student account I am testing with is not a local administrator either. 
 I&#x27;ve been troubleshooting this all week and am completely lost now. There are no SRP logs in Event Viewer either, so I can&#x27;t even see why it isn&#x27;t working. 
 Any advice for me here is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
 EDIT - Might have my answer already. I’m running 22H2 and SRP is deprecated in favour of AppLocker. Thanks everyone!

The issue is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to change/renew the stored hardware addresses, but oddly even trying to update the time causes an error. Any thoughts?

 Ideally we&#x27;d like to do a risk assesment of our cybersecurity posture and use this to drive improvement actions/the business case to fund improgvement actions.

 Current State
 The mail-component of Gmail currently and always has worked great Outlook 365 (Windows 10 desktop client). I have the IMAP set up appropriately, so all folders, including draft/trash functionality, work great. The same is true with the iPhone Mail app - mail and folders all work great there.

Now today Microsoft released a fix for the Windows Snipping Tool vulnerability ( CVE-2023-28303 ) that we need to update. Even the Microsoft page references the store for this patch. Now obviously I&#x27;m not going to connect to a couple hundred machines and update manually. We use Endpoint Central for patching, so how do you guys update store apps with tools like SCCM and such? I need to get this resolved so I can get a couple other apps updated like Print3d and 3D Viewer updated. Thanks.

                              <span>Is it better or recommended to keep replacing UPS batteries instead of buying new UPS units?
 We have many network cabinets dotted around the site with 700VA UPS for power backup, usually after 8 months they go bad. Sometimes we simply have a company come in to replace the batteries and work goes on, or we buy new ones. I have calculated and seen that it&#x27;s cheaper by $20 per UPS to replace the batteries
 However on the technical side of things is this a good practice

But I need help finding firmware or drivers because they require a dell corporate account to download. It&#x27;s ridiculous in my opinion; these machines are ancient and discontinued. What does Dell have to lose by making the files public? Could anybody with a corporate account send me a few things? I&#x27;d really appreciate the latest firmware and tools relevant for managing and using with vSphere.
 Also, can I jump to the latest version if they need to be updated, or would I have to update one version at a time? Any experiences or advice about this particular model would also be much appreciated.

                              <span>Someone tagged me a week ago for a role, for a proposal they had with [insert big corp/whatever here]. They just came back to me, asking to list every single supervisor I&#x27;ve ever worked for. Name, title, contacts, etc. Oh and to hurry.
 I&#x27;ve heard of companies wanting one or two, maybe three managerial references. Something which I&#x27;m not comfortable with because, well, my coworkers know me better. And quite frankly many of my former supervisors were less than on-the-level in one way or another. Listing every single one, though? Mmm no.
 Additional information:
 I should clarify the story a wee bit. The company in question is setting up a bid proposal for a contract with a government entity. The government entity already has something in place regarding work history and general trustworthiness--if they had any questions they could look someone up. The information is available, they just have to reach out to X org.

                              <span>It asks me to set up Servers and workstation and other resources as required in BareMetal or Virtual Environment.
 I have used Office 365, Azure, Windows Server 2016 and 2019 but it’s the bare minimum. I have little experience with using them in a more advanced setting, nor with administration either. I also don’t know how to use VMware either 
 What do I do?! What are some questions I should expect be asked? I had a nice first interview with the HR specialist who said that the IT manager (who I will be interviewing with) liked my resume.

                              <span>I remember when this subreddit used to be filled with tips and solutions fixing complex problems. When we would find neat tools to use to make our life easier. Windows patch warnings about bricking updates etc. 
 Now I feel that there has been a blurred line between help desk issues and true Sysadmin. This sub is mainly filled with people complaining about users or their shitty job and not about any complex or difficult issue they are trying to solve. 
 I think there should be a mandatory flair for user related issues or job so we can just mentally filter those posts out. Or these people should just move over to r/helpdesk since most are not sysadmins to begin with. 
 Tho I feel for some that are a one man shop help desk/ admin. Which is why a flair revamp might be better direction. 
 Thoughts ?

We are four and two of us have been working there for 5+ years and the head sysadmin retired. 
 After a rather large incident we finally got a green-light from the heads to rebuild/fix the system and as luck would have it, during this summer there will be a period where we can go fully dark (basically turn off everything with maybe 10-20 people complaining) so we want to maximize everything we can do in that period.

                              <span>So, I am looking at updating our password policy for my org and I know a lot of focus is on length over complexity nowadays, and I was trying to put together some helpful tips for users on choosing passphrases instead of passwords and I wanted to give them a resource to play with so they could see the difference and I saw some of these password strength meters mentioned, but they seem to throw vastly different results which I think as an end user would confuse me if I was really choosing a secure password.
 For example, a phrase like &quot;Ihaveareallybighouse!&quot; is 21 characters with upper, lower, and special characters and https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ says it would take &quot;1 hundred quintillion years&quot; to crack whereas passwordmonster.com says it would take 3 days lol.
 I&#x27;m just wondering do you have any tools you trust to give to end users to help them make sure they are choosing good passwords?

I know it&#x27;s not the cool new thing on the block but I would prefer it for stuff like infrastructure or organizational change projects any day.
 If you want to get an impression check out this doc about a prince2 project initiation document: https://prince2.wiki/management-products/project-initiation-documentation/
 In case it comes accross a little bit to advertisy: I am not affiliated with the prince2 publisher. Just someone who suffered through a lot of unnecessary agile, has been working in a prince2 org for two years now and really likes it.

 We are just about to roll out 20 Dell usb C laptops. 
 We need to attach 2 external screens at home and in the office, so will need one at each location. 
 Any recommendations? 
 Do others supply docking station at the home location or generally only allow one external monitor? 
 Thanks in advance.

 This was a couple of years ago and I happened to become responsible for the IT infrastructure and all IT related stuff for a small non-profit. We had been trying to find a good messaging app for the organisation to use and had been moving from Facebook Messenger to Signal some time prior, but the issue was that Signal hadn&#x27;t any group admin stuff yet and so every time a volunteer left, they had to themselves leave the Signal group. You see the issue.
 So I set out to find a solution and thought that a real communicationsplatfr…</span>

                              <span>Google is proposing a shorter life for security certs that secure all of the #WWW today. #Apple have done this, forcefully on their platforms - iOS and macOs, shortening them from 2 years to ~ 1 year and 1 month. My wager is on #Google using their massive market share in the browser market to push this to the finish line. 
 With this likely to pass, the writing is already on the wall, it&#x27;ll be key to automate the renewal of certificates by clients like acme.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently struggling with a task regarding Conditional Access Policies.
 We want (must) allow users to use Teams on their private computers at home, because not all have work devices and teams via citrix is just not useable at all, but they should not be allows any other cloud app such as Exchange Online, Sharepoint, or so.
 So i created 2 policies:
 1: &quot;External Device Access&quot;: This policy applies if the device is not on a trusted network, applying to All Cloud apps - excluding &quot;Microsoft Teams&quot;, as grant access it requires a compliant domain joined device with multi factor every x hours.
 2: &quot;Allow Teams everywhere&quot;: This policy applies if the device is not on a truste network, but only to the Cloud app &quot;Microsoft Teams&quot;, as grant access it only requires multi factor every x hours.
 So far so good, Exchange Online, Sharepoint does not work on non domain joined devices now, but so does Teams. The second CA policy never gets triggered for some reason and i dont know why.
 Has anyone of you something similar done already?

                              <span>Hello guys!
 For you admin guys what are the best practices when create a Distribution List (nomenclature)?
 examples: (DisplayName)
 [DL-Customer-Test](mailto:DL-customertest@contoso.com)
 DL-Customer Test
 Customer Test
 ........
 What I mean is like in our company there is not a lot of organization for example we have distribution lists with &quot;dots&quot;,&quot;hyphen&quot;, etc ex:([customer.Test-delivery@](mailto:costumer.Test-delivery@)....)
 what I mean I guess It could be more organize with a structure
 Ex: [Costumer-test-Delivery@](mailto:Costumer-test-Delivery@)... or DL-CostumerTestDelivery
 This way I was asking if you guys have a structure when creating a Distribution List?
 Thank you so much

                              <span>I work for a very high level professional company, think finance/lawyer type people (gotta keep it semi anonymous!!)
 Going on day 7 without our vdi environment, it should be back up tomorrow morning though with a few tweaks. They have had the ability to have our hd retrieve docs to work on offline all week though on personal machines. (I know not great, but needed) 
 Management has been nice to be when Ive crossed paths and said how much they appreciate all the effort. Made sure we have been fed all week working around the clock at least. 
 I think the BOD is giving my managers a much different front though. 
 I&#x27;m an engineer and have been onsite/online for 14+ average since it started 9 days ago. Today my manager told another engineer that the bod expectation is we are here around the clock until it gets fixed and was pretty pushy about it. 
 Has anyone experience an IT purge shortly after an incident? Would it just be management? Or have you seen whole departments be evicted and outsourced? 
 I&#x27;m just trying to think through the odds I don&#x27;t have a job in a month and if this place is worth putting in the hours for now...
 To clarify, I&#x27;m also an engineer, which I hope would help protect my job a bit more.

                              <span>After few weeks of non-commitment and hesitation I&#x27;m committed to taking 350-901 DEVCOR on Wednesday in order to recertify my CCNP of 10+ years and to make a step towards obtaining DevNet professional status.
 It took me almost 2 months since my first post about DEVCOR to commit but now I&#x27;m all in. DEVCOR is an expensive exam, $480 (incl. taxes) is not really cheap, so I&#x27;ve spent extra $90 on the official assessment exam in order to get understanding of what topics and level of detail to expect, learn the format of the exam and to know what topics I need to revise. It has 80 % passing score, I scored 59 % on the first try with no study and 82 % on the second after revising for a day. I am much more relaxed now that I have a better picture of what the exam is like.
 With 3 days left I plan to skim through the official study guide, focusing on topics I failed in the practice exam. If you have anything to point out or recommend to focus on I&#x27;ll appreciate your ideas.

                              <span>Has anyone ever purchased rj45 that simply didn&#x27;t work? I have spent the last 2 weeks troubleshooting and trying to figure out what was wrong... I have terminated and cut and re-terminated countless cables thinking I messed up the wires, or the cable was bad. I even thought there was an issue with my switch! I&#x27;ve now all but confirmed it was the f&#x27;n RJ45 purchased off amazon. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before and with every single end in the order. I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t think this to be the issue and I&#x27;m curious as to how common this is now?

                              <span>I was just thinking about the evolution from VPLS to EVPN from the SP&#x27;s perspective and this idea strut me. Is there still a need for L2VPN with it being either VPLS/EVPN for customers?
 In the past you would buy VPLS if you were, let&#x27;s say, a hosting company with more sites and needed to migrate the VM&#x27;s from one site to the other without changing the IP address.
 But now, if you are the same hosting company, you can just run OSPF from the CE to the PE and advertise Loopback of all VTEP&#x27;s and deploy EVPN VXLAN on your switches.
 So my question is maybe especially for SP guys: who&#x27;s buying L2VPN?

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m trying to find an explanation for why when an optical gig port on an NE40 is configured with autoneg disabled, the interface still passes traffic without error, but causes the connected ADVA interface to show as down, while it is also passing all the traffic it is supposed to. 
 Basically some of our team are troubleshooting TLOS faults, where auto neg is disabled, setting neg to auto, then closing the job, when in reality, the neg settings have no bearing on the functionality of the circuit and the TLOS is being caused by something else, which is missed because of the assumption that auto neg being disabled was causing the fault. Any technical explanation for this phenomena would may help where my logic and real world examples have failed to convince colleagues.

 Novice networker here. I set up a network for a few devices at work to communicate with each other. I expected limited capability to connect to various wifi networks, but I thought I could at least connect to my personal iPhone hotspot. However, I cannot even do that. Can anyone help me with this or at least give me a clue as to where to start so that I can connect to my iPhone hotspot and not disrupt the network all my devices are connected to?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get this working and so far I&#x27;m having no luck. It&#x27;s super simple to get a DHCP server running using a L3 port on a router, just configure the pool, give the L3 port an IP in the pool and boom, anything that connects to that port will be able to pull an IP address.
 But when I try to use an SVI and a L2 port instead I can&#x27;t get it to work. I&#x27;ve got a vlan interface with an IP address in the pool, then I put the L2 port in that vlan, but clients can&#x27;t get IPs. Is there some other piece that I&#x27;m missing? Or is it even possible to configure a DHCP server this way?

                              <span>To those of you who must support legacy applications whose servers cannot be re-IP’d - in an active/passive production DC/DR DC type setup, I’m curious how you’ve setup your core routing to advertise your production subnets in an actual DR scenario, while in a passive/DR testing scenario - keeping the DR’d replica subnets local to the DR site.
 For example, my production DC subnets are say: 10.0.0.0/22 carved out into 4 subnets with SVIs: 10.0.0.1/24, 10.0.1.1/24, 10.0.2.1/24, 10.0.3.1/24 on the core.
 In my DR site I have some active subnets/SVIs for management/jump box that are always advertised: 10.1.0.1/24, 10.1.1.1/24 on the core.
 I do not stretch layer-2 between my prod and DR sites. In a DR scenario, in my DR site I can bring up and advertise matching subnets/SVIs matching those from my production site - who theoretically just got blown up and is unreachable. I can bring up my VMs and infrastructure through replication. My MPLS provider speaks EIGRP with me so I can reannounce that 10.0.0.0/22 now lives in DR. This is all fine and tested.
 My issue is that in a test scenario where I want to bring up VMs and test them on their original subnets - I’m curious how you folks would handle this. Would you advertise with a lower metric and risk a split brain routing scenario (scary)? Would you suppress advertisements until you’re ready to be in a DR scenario (seems safer)?
 I can comfortably automate these types of changes via Cisco scripting/my choice of automation front end. I just want to be able to test these VMs from a sandbox in DR that you can get to via a jump box.
 Open to all ideas and possibilities! Just curious what others have done.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m testing two DELL S5048F with VLT and peer routing. I have a doubt regarding the primary node failure.
 This is the configuration: sw-core1 is the primary node, sw-core2 is the backup node. Peer routing is enabled on both nodes.
 Both switches contains VLAN 40 and VLAN 50 with an ip address assigned. sw-core1 is the default gateway for the devices inside VLAN 40 and VLAN 50.
 These are the tests performed:
 When both switches are powered on devices on VLAN 40 can ping the devices on VLAN 50 as expected.
 When one switch are powered off (failure scenario) PC on VLAN 40 can ping the PC on VLAN 50 as expected.
 If during a failure scenarion of the primary node (sw-core1 powered down) I restart the backup node (sw-core2) after the boot I cannot ping any device indefinitely. Only powering on the sw-core1 restore the comunication.
 Is this a correct behavior or I&#x27;m missing something in the configuration? It could be a normal behavior because at the startup sw-core2 has only the ip assigned locally and cannot synchronize with sw-core1. So, the backup node cannot know the IPs assigned to the sw-core1 interfaces.
 Thank you. Regards.

                              <span>Do any dynamic DNS providers support IPv6? Preferably something where one host can send dynamic updates and replace just the prefix in all your records, rather than needing a DNS update client on each host you want a DNS record for since there is no NAT.

                              <span>Does anyone know of a switch or some kind of demarc device that can do remote RFC2544 testing of some kind? Even just something that can run iperf. Maybe a linux based switch we can install iperf on. I need something on the remote end of fiber circuits that I can have a client plug in and then I can test the link without have a PC plugged in.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s a stupid question. But I can&#x27;t recall reading anywhere that STP root bridges or bridge IDs are checked when forwarding traffic.
 But in a recent test I saw that when the bridge I&#x27;d was changed, the traffic although on directly connected links didn&#x27;t go anywhere. After disabling STP the bridge ID upstream reverted to the expected value and then traffic worked fine.

                              <span>I come from the Novell NE2000 10base2 coax era. Wifi was really hot stuff. Then when they brought us low cost 900mhz wifi bridges in the 90&#x27;s that was great. Then about 10 years ago, they stopped making that band equipment, gave it away to the power grid or something.
 There seems to be so many applications for NLOS service, really hard to believe it&#x27;s completely unavailable... unless we want to pay $250+ a piece for 10-20 year old used equipment on ebay.
 Nothing NLOS commercially available any longer, without spending thousands?

 Customer is having intermittent connectivity issues when making an API call from a server in the DMZ to a server on the internal network using TCP/9004. This will be working for a couple of days, sometimes only hours, then it stops working. Logs on the firewall (FortiGate) will show the traffic being allowed, then it will intermittently hit the implicit deny rule. One of the first things that I tried was extending the session timeout on the policy as it felt like the session was getting closed, but that didn&#x27;t seem to work. I also stripped the policy down to barebones, no UTM, all services, etc. I started working with support on this and th…</span>

                              <span>EDIT: Somehow mixed IRL (In real life) and thought IRT would mean In real time. I&#x27;m so sorry :(
 EDIT 2: Mostly need to check which devices are always online (most likely servers), which come and go (most likely teachers), and which static IPs never go active (So I can reassign them as I need)
 Hey guys, new here, first of all I&#x27;m from Chile so my English might not be perfect. I&#x27;m at a new job on this university, where they already have a complex network as I&#x27;ve seen, but they never kept track of it internally (I mean on my department) besides having an old Excel which isn&#x27;t even up to date (Lots of devices that doesn&#x27;t exist anymore and new ones that weren&#x27;t registered).
 I&#x27;m trying to monitor this network, for which I already tried Solarwinds (which have 50 sensors in its free version) and Nagios (which seems unpractical since I have to manually categorize every device and I can&#x27;t confirm every single one of them). Is there any solution that allows me to just make an in real time scan on an IP range constantly just to ping active hosts? Preferably It&#x27;d be nice to keep track of the last time in which devices were active. I can run a server.
 Thanks in advance and sorry for my English.

                              <span>My understanding of how NICs work is that there is a Ring buffer (circular queue) of descriptors this Ring buffer is normally known as a Ring descriptor. The role of this Ring Descriptor is to tell the NIC where in some pre-allocated memory pool are there free objects for the NIC to DMA it&#x27;s receiving packets. There seems to be a Receive Ring Descriptor and Transmit Ring Descriptor.
 Questions:
 (1) Are these Ring Descriptors stored in memory or on the NIC?
 (2) I&#x27;ve occasionally read about receive queues, are these different from Receive Ring Descriptors? If so where are these stored, on the NIC or memory? ... I&#x27;ve specifically read that the packets first get written to the Receive queues and then from there to pre-allocated memory pool, however can&#x27;t find anything conclusive on this.

When you cut it over to 9300 catalyst its works auto-detects 100mbs but if the swiss log device&#x27;s power blips then the port comes up then down on the newer switch. if i were to quickly pop it back on to the old switch and then pop it back to the newer switch it will comes back up.

                              <span>A have large site network that, once upon a time, needed 21 MST instances. Over the years, the topology was consolidated so that one of two core switches became the root bridge for every VLAN at the site. The appropriate number of MST instances for us to have today is two.
 We knock down and stand up subnets all the time, and every time we do, we have to pick an unused VLAN tag that is already mapped to one of the 21 MST instances—which is fine, but the instances have no bearing to what we actually do. When an engineer asks, &quot;Which instance should I pull this tag from?&quot; the answer is, &quot;Whichever you want.&quot; Consequently, things are so mixed up that we&#x27;d have to not only create a new MST region, but basically start over with our VLAN tag/subnet associations to get them into the correct one of the two new instances.
 I&#x27;m not clinically OCD, but I hate inefficiency and inconsistency. Hate. It. If this were a small business, I&#x27;d be willing to substantially inconvenience my life to clean this up during maintenance windows. But this is a site that has hundreds of VLANs, 600 users, a datacenter with 80 server racks, and a significant internet presence. When a city has poor road design, we all live with it because it&#x27;s impossible to fix without knocking the city down. I&#x27;m thinking this might be one of those situations. I&#x27;ve never tried to fix an MST region before, but I know it can&#x27;t be done without downtime. And literally the only people who even know about this inconvenience are the network team. Cleaning it up will not noticeably improve network function.
 Do you agree that we should just deal with it forever? What kinds of unfixable legacy spaghetti configs exist on your network?

I am planning to buy 3-4 Unifi U6 lite and a POE switch and I need to have visibility on the traffic management to be able to control my data quota. Also, i have many smart devices and im planning to create a vlan for these. After my investigation i see the dream machine SE should be the best fit, but im worried about losing alot of the DM SE functionalities due to the ONT limitations. Any advise what should I do, should i go ahead with the DM SE or is there another recommendation?

 I&#x27;m relatively new to networking, and need to find out the Tx Power Range and Receiver Sensitivity of a batch of 1G LRs. 
 Is there a way I can calculate this with a switch, or do I need to purchase some specialist kit?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m working on a small project and need some help in the area of mobile networks. I would like to have a network connection as stable as possible, preferably without interruptions, since I want to stream while driving and on the go in general. The device(s) should ideally fit into a backpack.
 I can provide up to about 6 SIM cards, each with unlimited internet access. Also important to mention I guess would be, that I live in Germany, but also travel some times within Europe. What would you recommend?

                              <span>I wrote a &#x27;glue&#x27; to unload routes from a database into kernel routing tables.
 I marked routes from my &#x27;glue&#x27; code with a custom &#x27;proto&#x27; (42 is babel, 2 is static, 186 is bgp). I use a different number &#x27;111&#x27; for my routes. This really helps me to know if I should add/delete a route or not.
 Now I want to import routes from kernel into Bird, but I can&#x27;t find a way to specify &#x27;proto&#x27;. (My search is complicated by the fact that Bird is using word &#x27;protocol&#x27; to name own pieces of config).
 Is there a way to say Bird to export routes with a specific proto num?
 The current import stanza in my bird looks like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; table kern_91;
 filter private_only { if (net ~ [10.0.0.0/8+]) then { accept; } reject; }
 protocol kernel kern_91 { kernel table 91; learn; ipv4 { table table_91; import filter private_only; export none; }; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I I just can&#x27;t find a place for proto 111 anywhere around. Is it possible?
 This is example of the route I want to import:
  10.10.10.0/24 via 127.0.0.1 dev lo table 91 proto 111 scope 0

 I have a layer-2 switch with lots of VLANs on it. I would like to connect one of the ports to a simple 8-port switch and have that 8-port switch only on 1 of the VLANs so that anything plugged into the 8-port switch would automatically operate on VLAN10 for example and still work. How would I configure this on my managed 24-port switch?

 If yes, send me a message and I’ll send you some information how your company can improve their network and security performance and save a lot of money.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve bought a used NETGEAR ProSafe FVS318G. I want to upgrade the firmware to the latest version, because the one that it has is very old and seems to be buggy sometimes. So I downloaded the image file, navigated to Administration -&gt; Settings Backup &amp; Upgrade, selected the file and hit upload. The progress bar showed up for around 3 seconds and then the page disappeared and a &quot;Connection was reset&quot; error occurred. I tried using different browsers. Then I connected to the device via telnet, and tried to use the admin/upgradeFirm/upgrade command, but no luck here either. I am not sure if I used the command correctly though, because I couldn&#x27;t find any useful information about it. I tried giving it an IP of a TFTP server and HTTP server, nothing worked, just a &quot;error: Error in Firmware upgrade&quot; message. Invoking &quot;cliErrno get&quot; returned -1, and I don&#x27;t know what it means. Does anyone have experience with that kind of stuff. Is there any way I can update the firmware or am I stuck with this version? What could cause this, is the router physically damaged? If yes, can I repair it somehow?

                              <span>I&#x27;d love to see the internet become an IPv6-only space within my lifetime... but I feel like the only way this will get done is by tier 1 providers getting together and forcing a change... and yeah, I know IPv6 adoption is already increasing. But as I see it, we&#x27;re going to be stuck in a dual-stack world until everyone is forced to only use IPv6 on the public internet.
 So, what scenario do you think it more likely?
  
The Big ISP&#x27;s get together and announce they will no longer route IPv4 by &quot;X&quot; date.
 
We keep running IPv4 forever and deploy widespread CG-NAT as a bandaid.

On the back end we would like to consolidate IT to make things easier to manage. This would also make it easier to add new companies as acquired.
 There is a possibility to someday all fly under one company brand but ideally that wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal if we were already consolidated.
 My question is how to best approach the consolidation without losing identity.

                              <span>I get we&#x27;re venting here but man, you know it&#x27;s not a user&#x27;s job to understand the systems they&#x27;re using, right? It&#x27;s your job to ask the right questions when they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening. And come on, who here has never forgotten a password? I don&#x27;t understand people&#x27;s need to get combative with users, especially to the point of pulling logs? Like that&#x27;s just completely unproductive and makes you very unpopular in the long run, even to the techs who have to deal with the further frustrated users. Explaining complex systems to everyone in terms that make sense is an important part of our jobs.
 Edit: Folks, I agree users should have basic computer skills, but it’s been my experience at least that the people who do the hiring and firing don’t care about that as much as we do… So unless someone is doing something dangerous or egregious, this is also an unfortunate part of the job we have to accept.

                              <span>I hope this is the correct subreddit for asking this question. I looked at r/networking and figured my questions are far too basic for professionals, as I am a beginner in the profession, with 2 years of experience and no certs asking beginner/intermediate questions, and figured this subreddit was more appropriate.
 The Equipment We Have:
 Three servers, all of them are desktop in form factor, an 8 camera PoE NVR with none of its cabling coming from our main switch, a 24 port Trendnet TEG-S24g, and three 48 port category 5 patch panels. Sitting on top of everything in the server rack is an itty bitty Arris Surfboard modem hooked up to a consumer Asus router from a few years ago. (Yes, I know we shouldn&#x27;t be using a consumer hardware, and I am working to address that, but I am stuck with it…</span>

                              <span>We are currently using golden images for our system due to some legacy banking software that takes a significant amount of time to configure (around 15-20 minutes). These images also include pre-installed software such as Microsoft Office, Adobe, and Citrix.
 For other programs, i have created PowerShell scripts that help desk technicians use to pick and choose which programs to install based on the user&#x27;s job title.
 To create these golden images, we use Hyper-V to create a checkpoint, then Sysprep and boot to WinPE. We then use DISM capture-image commands to capture the WIM file.
 However, I was wondering if there is a more efficient way to automate the image capture process

 I started to learn about computers, programming, administration etc. during the 90s and has since been reading all kinds of kinds of medias, everything from Usenet, IRC to modern day subreddits. This subreddit specially comes across as a bunch of very stressed, frustrated and sometimes depressed people rather than a bunch of passionate people discussing new tech, ideas or whatnot. Why is that?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 So as the title says, I have a former employee that has 2FA for the Google Workspace account set to their personal number and now that we are off-boarding them we have an issue. I need to Migrate their account to an Archive we set up which requires an app password to do. Unfortunately, I cannot create that app password without verifying 2FA to the employee&#x27;s number. Has anyone been able to change the phone number for a users 2FA? We have 2FA set up for the whole org so turning it off just for this person isn&#x27;t really the move. I have some ideas for general workaround but Im curious if anyone has experience with this. Thank you all for your input!
 ​
 EDIT:
 Thank you u/thunder923111 for the suggestion! This worked and I was able to move forward.

                              <span>Story from the last layoff...
 We now have this policy in place that, when you&#x27;re let go, you start a &quot;countdown&quot; till your last day. Some layoffs have been 30 days, some have been 60 days, some have been two weeks. But while you&#x27;re &quot;counting down,&quot; you can take all the paid time off you want to look for a job. Some managers let you go home with your laptop and just WFH till your last day.
 Now, as generous as this sounds, they do this for a singular reason. If you find another job during your countdown, you&#x27;re not eligible for the severance package.
 Well, we had one guy that had been there FOREVER and got laid off. He was eligible for well over 6 months&#x27; salary in severance. Out of respect for his long history with the company, his manager let him WFH during his whole 30 day countdown...
 28 days into his countdown, someone from my company goes to another company to have lunch with a friend. And he sees his old coworker working there at a desk, with our company laptop with the asset tag clearly visible on the open lid. When the guy walks away from his desk, sure enough, it&#x27;s our laptop. The guy is VPNed in, and logged into Outlook and MS Lync (This should tell you how long ago this happened).
 The guy comes back from lunch and tells his coworkers about how the guy they lost on the team landed at a new company where this guy they know works. Sadly, the manager overheard them talking. He called HR. And the guy lost his severance package.
 So damn close...

 So now I&#x27;m trying to get inventory, access to stuff I think I need, etc.
 That said, we are cloud based 100% but we&#x27;ve been getting hit with spam/phishing and can&#x27;t decide if this is the spot to ask or r/office365.
 Is the exchange defender worth it or would something that works with exchange be a better solution for a relative small company?
 I&#x27;m learning as I go here as I didn&#x27;t work on the back end of 365 bedore.

 Ok, cool, let&#x27;s take a look.
 Yep, lots of disconnects in the logs. Looks like for all the users at that company too.
 Both Office, and warehouse PCs.
 Error codes indicate that the traffic from the client just stopped.
 K, Lets take a look at one of the PCs.
 They&#x27;re using wireless. ok...
 Wireless cards &#x3D; asus ac53 nano
 Wireless access point, WRT-54G.
 &quot;Found problem. Customer needs to consult IT professional, not owner&#x27;s nephew in HS&quot;

                              <span>Afternoon reddit,
 I am a system admin for various companies. I essentially consult but in a way i am onsite with the company handling all their docs, internal items, and other for smaller companies which is why i can administrate so many at once. I have one company i&#x27;ve been with for 10+ years but they got bought out and now have an MSP, that literally just keeps making mistake after mistake. They are never onsite, they move around reservations DHCP and change scopes due to lack of knowing the firewall, and generally cause the site a lot of issues. Which is great for me right, i make a ton of money off their mistakes. Sorry but that isn&#x27;t my game. I like good business and administration, not causing a hedge fire and saying o well #xyz is just another client. Recently i did a large overhaul and installation of new networks, vlans, wifi, ect... Today i get a call they made more changes and now changed the firewall password essentially forcing everything through them which for me means extra hours billing to wait on a tech. Is it time to just let the clients turn into an inferno and go about my day or should i be grateful my income is probably going to double from them and just shut up and color?
 It just really freakin urks me how bad they are for such a large company taking care of a small hotel which is literally nothing to manage. How do you guys deal with bad MSP&#x27;s that the company is married into?

                              <span>Morning fellow sysadmins,
 Ive been advised of an employee who’s contract ends in a week, and has not been renewed. The employee knows this, and is fairly pissed off about it, Ive been told.
 We are a M365 shop, with Intune, and Sophos Firewalls with filtering, Backups in the cloud etc.
 While I have no reason to be concerned, since the user doesnt have any type of admin credentials or can do anything (and complains about it constantly), I was wondering what else I can do to restrict the user in case of any acting out. 
 My current plan is to nuke his laptop from orbit (wipe) once I get it, and his office accounts will just get moved to shared mailboxes, etc. All his access will get cut off at the time of his last minute etc. 
 Of course, he may just decide to push his laptop off the edge of desk, which isn’t my problem either. 
 Ive never really thought about what else is out there, so I thought I would throw it out here just to see what others say. Im sure there are some stories that have a lesson out there.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed on the new Win 11 builds that if you go to control panel and click on &quot;Devices and Printers&quot; it is now opening the &quot;Bluetooth &amp; Devices&quot; modern settings menu. 
 I did find that if you right-click &quot;Devices and Printers&quot; and select &quot;Open in new window&quot; then it still brings up the classic &quot;Devices and Printers&quot; menu I know and love. 
 ​
 This is isn&#x27;t really a rant or anything, I&#x27;m just kind of sad that my preferred menu for changing print drivers and printing test pages seems to be going away. I wonder how long until it goes away completely and we are forced to use the new settings menu. 
 ​
 Onward and upward, I guess.

 Do you know ? 
 The UPS has an RJ45 port but well, I doesn’t really tell me if it support it or not.

                              <span>For those that manage WSUS, how are you handling updates in a hybrid workplace environment (post-pandemic)? Are you still having your WSUS download all necessary Windows client and server updates to one WSUS server and distribute them to both clients &amp; servers? or are you having your clients &amp; servers get their updates directly from Microsoft (with WSUS just doing the approvals)? Or are you doing a mix of both, with potentially clients going to the internet and the servers still using the WSUS server to get theirs? (and on that last note, can WSUS be setup to distribute updates to servers, but ask clients to download their own updates from the internet?)

                              <span>Hi there!
 My video production house is upgrading it’s infrastructure for remote work. One of our needs is a rack of Mac Studios for remote work. However, we want two stations in our office to be available for remote people to use when needed. In an ideal world, those two stations could be connected to any of the Mac Studios at any time. The Macs would live in our data closet, and the stations would be about 30 feet away near a fiber-connected switch (if that makes a difference).
 My first thought was a KVM, but I’ve heard that these are not the most reliable in terms of latency. Each station would have two monitors, mouse, keyboard, and headphones.
 Does anyone know if this is viable with hardware? My backup solution would be to use Jump desktop to remote into the stations via LAN, which I think would work just as well.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, we are in the process of transitioning from on-prem to Exchange Online. At present, we use a Public Folder mailbox to manage project team emails, and the mailbox database has grown to 125GB in size. It would be much larger than that if we weren&#x27;t using Metalogix Archive Manager to archive many of those Public Folder emails.
 The Public Folder database in Exchange Online is 100GB and Shared Mailbox is 100GB, which is insufficient for our needs. I&#x27;m exploring alternative solutions for sharing emails among project team members. I&#x27;m hoping my situation is not uncommon.
 Below is an image of how we&#x27;ve structured the public folder mailbox for email sharing:

 Normally this process for win10 machines takes about 10-15 minutes and done. For some reason windows 11 takes HOURS and the counter keeps going up. Eventually reaching a point where it&#x27;s not feasible to let it continue.
 We are a small school corporation with TONS of network bandwidth so it is not bottle necking there. The image is just basic 11 with our office keys and a couple things of basic software so it&#x27;s not a massive image.
 I am at a complete and total loss... any help/guidance would be appreciated
 ​
 edit: The machine I am pushing the image to is a Lenovo M70Q Gen 3 if that helps

 We have it installed on a number of endpoints, predecessor lost the password. We have no active contract with them and their docs are locked behind logins. 
 Looking for a safe mode uninstaller (windows)... 
 Thanks in advance!

The Device info is the user&#x27;s PC. There are 3 other IPs 142.120.x.x , 142.127.x.x , 142.170.x.x alternating between each users&#x27; actual QC or ON location and UZ. Showing for browser items but also for Windows Sign-in. 
 Faulty WHOIS lookup info - or - some kind of intrusion ? Placing a ticket - I&#x27;ll be placing a ticket, but am afraid I will get someone who only assumes what I have and doesn&#x27;t actually dig to confirm or find out what mechanism the location info comes from. What do you think, what would you do ?

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Hi,
 We are planning to harden our internal cryptography and after doing my due diligence I came with following settings (they will be applied via GPO, slowly, one by one to servers and endpoints) as something what makes sense now. 
 SSL 2.0 - Disabled
 SSL 3.0 - Disabled
 TLS 1.0 - Disabled
 TLS 1.1 - Disabled
 TLS 1.2 - Enabled
 TLS 1.3 – System default
 Ciphers in order:
 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 What worries me, is quite short list of ciphers which were left after eliminating everything what is considered as a weak.
 I realize that some strange legacy systems will be a problem but I’m looking for advise from somebody who recently harden windows cryptography in their environment, what problems can potentially occur with standard systems, e.g. Windows server and desktop, SQL, IIS, AD, file shares and so on.

 I’m hoping someone can put me out of my misery here, I am trying to work out how to connect intune with the Graph API so I can have a play with it and run some queries against our iOS devices. Not actually used Graph before so I’m probably being a bit daft! 
 Appreciate any advice

                              <span>I am wondering if I can modify old Kensington laptop locks instead of buying the slightly smaller NanoSaver locks.
 The standard Kensington laptop lock slot is 3x7mm, and the newer Kensington NanoSave slot is 2.5x6mm.
 The modification would basically entail grinding/filing off a little metal from the &quot;fingers&quot; of the lock, which grip inside of the locking slot.
 Can anyone see how this mod might compromise the security of the lock vs. buying a NanoSaver lock which already comes with a smaller set of locking fingers? 
 Even out of the box, these types of locks aren&#x27;t able to prevent a determined attacker anyways (cutting/decoding/picking/impressioning), so perhaps the only point is just to save $$$.
 What do y&#x27;all think?

                              <span>I need to investigate a case for a shared mailbox, where a user set the Autoreply message that irritated customers.
 The Exchange Online PowerShell command &quot;Get-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration&quot; only gives me basic information about status of the Autoreply message and the current text etc. but not who or when it was changed.
 I have a Microsoft E5 license and thus access to all portals (Purview, Security etc.) - how can I find out who changed the Autoreply-Configuration?

                              <span>So we have Office 365 which means we have an Azure AD and Azure AD Connect syncs the on-prem AD with Azure AD.
 We have a hosted app that can use LDAPS authentication but I can&#x27;t work out if I can enable LDAPS on the Azure AD included with 365 without specifically paying for Azure Active Directory Domain Services.
 https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/
 This guide reads to me like it&#x27;s not included with 365 and we&#x27;d need to add a paid Azure subscription on the tenant?

 Does anyone know please?

 Apply this rule if* &gt; The recipient &gt; is this person &gt; &#x27;user.mailbox&#x27;

                              <span>Hi All
 In case this helps someone out:
 We jumped from E3 to E5 for 400+ users yesterday. Our licenses are applied via AAD Groups where we have license features turned on/off as required. Our CSP/NCE handled the process and opted to upgrade our existing licenses. When the process completed all staff were on E5 with ALL E5 features turned on including Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing.
 Evidently, Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing once enabled does the following:
  
Sends an email to all staff with their personal Audio Conferencing pin information (most of my staff thought this was a phishing email).
 Updates all future and recurring Teams Calendar meeting entries with the new Dial-in features. This uses the Meeting Migration Service (MMS) - Link
 Sends a meeting invite update to all attendees for each updated meeting
 If the recipient has their OoO on, an auto response is of course sent back to the organiser
  
The above has caused mass confusion for our staff and in some instances, users have 60+ meeting invites and auto response/OoO messages all at exactly the same time.
 It&#x27;s on us for not looking into this more but evidently its caught other people out as well. Link
 Looks like their is a cmd to disable the MMS for changes related to audio conferencing only.
 Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -AutomaticallyMigrateUserMeetings $false 
 Just wish we had known this before.
 Have a nice Friday.........

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I work as a tier 2 technician for an MSP and was wondering what other people&#x27;s experience is with being in an on-call rotation is like, this is my first actual position working directly in IT and based on feedback I have gotten from other people I know in the field I&#x27;ve been told that my on-call rotation unrealistic especially for the return. 
 I work in a team of 4 technicians and 3 of us participate in on-call which consists of being the only user working on after-hours tickets, 5PM-9PM Monday-Friday and 9AM-9PM weekends. We are expected to review any tickets that come in and work on them if they are deemed by either the customer or us important enough to service outside of normal hours, permitting their company has a proper contract for after hours support or they get approval from someone willing to pay the premium. This on-call included driving out to customer locations if the issue is of a truly critical nature. 
 The on-call rotation is a full week from 5PM Friday until the following Friday, and then 2 weeks no on-call for the other 2 on-call technicians, thus a 3-week cycle. The compensation for this on-call is 80 hours of vacation time that is awarded immediately on your start date with no rollover. 
 IF they hire additional Tier 2+ technicians then the rotation would be divided among all applicable techs but it&#x27;s already been six months and it doesn&#x27;t seem like they will be getting more people. 
 So yeah let me know what your on-call experiences are like and what you think of mine. Thank you.
 Note: Also for added context the company I work for has terrible procedure, leadership, and communication skills, and almost no one to fall back on if you have trouble resolving an issue.

                              <span>Hi reddit community
 What are your best (free preferred) tools and software for drawing an overview of your it systems (it infrastructure, application servers, network appliances, etc.)?
 I was promoted for managing our small it department (team of 3) and the system documentations (like system diagrams, etc.) are old and I want to create new diagrams of our it infrastructure.
 What could you recommend?
 TIA,

                              <span>Hey folks. I work for a small WISP, where we have a VPN to access our stuff out in the field. We have a VPN which for the most part works as expected, that is, until you try it on metro by T-Mobile. At&amp;t and Verizon are fine, but TMobile is having some glitches
 First of all, my TMobile phone has VPN access over wifi, and even when it&#x27;s roaming on at&amp;t, the VPN works. I mean, I can barely do general web browsing when it roams to at&amp;t, but accessing network resources actually works great. 
 &quot;Well when you say it doesn&#x27;t work, what do you actually mean by that?&quot;
 Well, I can turn it on and get an IP Address. I can go into visit whoismyisp.com and it will tell me the name of the ISP I work for (and not TMobile ), and web browsing is as good as without a VPN. I can ping the private addresses of stuff on our network. But when I try to log into the GUI of any equipment, it just times out. 
 That seems odd to me that I don&#x27;t know how that can even work, provided I can definitely get onto the VPN. 
 I am quite confident that reaching out to TMobile will be fruitless in getting the VPN to work properly. Any ideas what I could try here?

                              <span>My peers and I are designing a new network for a school district, let&#x27;s say... Fake School District. We&#x27;ve hit a good point in our switching and would like to move on to our wireless. In my mind, I would like the SSID&#x27;s setup like this:
 FSD - Main network; RADIUS for AD authentication FSD_Unsecured - No PSK; MAC ACL; exists only for devices that don&#x27;t support 802.1X FSD_Setup - No PSK; Access only to the site for agreeing to terms &amp; conditions and downloading the cert for the main network
 I have a few questions about the configuration I proposed here:
 1. Can I use the same NPS I use for the main network for the MAC ACL on the unsecured network? 2. If I register a MAC for the unsecured wireless network, can I dynamically assign a VLAN similar to security groups with my main network? 3. Will I need a web server for the FSD_Setup network or will my WLC (UniFi) do the trick? 
 Basically, I&#x27;d like these scenarios to be true:
 Scenario #1: A student brings their own device. They connect to FSD_Setup, click AGREE on the site and it redirects them to a site that downloads the certificate and shows screenshots and instructions for importing it. After importing it, they connect to the FSD network, type in their AD username and password, then, boom! They are now on the Student-Wireless VLAN and can do their assignments.
 Scenario #2: A teacher needs a Chromecast setup to cast to their TV. I take the physical address written on the back, log in to my server and register the device. On the setup wizard for the Chromecast, I join FSD_Unsecured and am now on the TV VLAN.
 Thank you!

                              <span>My work just got 2 EX4650 switches that are to be setup as core devices that will not have a router or firewall in front of them. Our ISP has provided 2 /30 subnets 1 for each device on port 0. I have looked over the Collapsed Core setup and got the switches talk with each other and an access switch but cant seem to get the vlans to route to the internet. Right now i have them setup in a lab environment to get setup right. When i ping 8.8.8.8 from the console it does get a response but when im using a laptop which is connected to the access switch using VLAN-100 i cant get a ping to 8.8.8.8

                              <span>I&#x27;m an HPC admin that is also in charge of our local network. We just bought a new storage server that is coming with a Mellanox ConnectX-7 200Gbe NIC. However, our main job server uses a Broadcom P2100G 100Gbe NIC. The ConnectX-7 uses QSFP112 and the P2100G uses QSFP56. What DAC should we be purchasing to connect the two? Would any standard QSFP56 cable work? All the vendors I&#x27;ve talked to don&#x27;t seem to know.
 As of right now, it would be a direct connection between the two, but we&#x27;re hoping to get a 200Gbe or 400Gbe switch by the end of the year.

                              <span>hi All! Any of you experienced with Ubiquiti? 
 porbably missing something very obvious but just trying to add ip fix adress to a CloudKey2+ console working with a Ubiquiti Unifi Switch USW Pro48poe;
  
 ⁠For the option to be enabled I need to have at least one network set with the ubiquiti switch pro as a router. normal?
  ⁠When trying to give it IP fix address in the 192.168.100.x range, it says can only be given one in the 192.168.1.x range. Why? Gateway is on 192.168.100.1 and switch just x.100.2. Need to keep the switch on that one for all network is setup for it to be on that IP. And understand both the ubiquiti console and unifi switch need to be on the same subnet (192.168.100.x in this case). Thanks for any suggestions... ;)

                              <span>Hi redditors,
 Im quite new to this sub-reddit, but enjoying the discussions! I have a question myself. We do a lot of layer-2 networking at our locations, so I wanted to try to implement VTP with Pruning enabled at one of our locations, because the allowed-vlans list at interfaces are not staying up-to-date, which means that there is a lot of unnecessary traffic going over trunk links. I&#x27;m having trouble setting up the VTP-pruning configuration. I&#x27;ve consulted a lot of documentation, but I think that I&#x27;m missing out on a detail. The vlan&#x27;s dont seem to be getting pruned. I&#x27;ve taken all of the steps that I read in a lot of guides. I want the interfaces from the coreswitch to the access-switch pruned so that not all of the traffic is going there. (Im still testing, this is not implemented o…</span>

                              <span>Have a network that has a pair of Cisco 4500s in VSS and looking to move to Nexus 9ks.
 My plan is to:
 Setup VPC domain and test
 Setup all VLANs on the new Nexus switches
 Setup all SVIs using HSRP with the production information, using lower priorities
 Verify VPC is complete and in sync
 Build the configurations for each IDF, switch ports, trunks, etc.
 Begin moving IDFs and devices over to the new Nexus switches
 Once everything has been migrated off the old cores, adjust priorities on the new Nexus SVIs to take over
 Remove old Cisco 4500s.
 Does anyone see any issues with this plan?
 Thank you. It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve migrated over a core pair.

I am looking for the best ways to approach this, as we have had issues in the past with bandwidth. Since it is only 1 day per year, I would love solutions that are low-cost; we&#x27;d prefer not to invest a lot of money into something we only use once.
 All clients are in the same convention hall (about 450 people total) and there will be next to no other networking traffic which is nice. Ideally we will have everyone upload their files to a SMB share or a PHP file upload website on a NAS with 2 SATA SSD&#x27;s in RAID 0 (which should saturate a 10gig NIC), but I&#x27;m open to other ideas.

This may be a little bit long, I apologize.
 Current setup -
 We have a single Cisco 9800-40 WLC hosted at our central HQ with several remote sites connected as spokes via ethernet circuits to HQ. We have several wireless networks already configured and working at each site, configured as L2 all the way back to HQ to each gateway - each reside in different VRFs which terminate/route at the firewall between the VRFs. The WLC is connected via a trunk off the downstream core switch before the firewall. 
 Current project -
 I have configured a new VRF to host a new SSID/s…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I found a way to make 100gig work over a single strand of fiber with LC tips. 
 For 100GbE 100 meter, this is my (~$340): https://www.fs.com/products/136833.html?attribute&#x3D;32524&amp;id&#x3D;597389 There are some Dell 100GbE 100 meter available (~$1000): https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-networking-transceiver-qsfp28-100gbe-swdm4-duplex-lc-om3-om4-mmf/apd/407-bbvn/networking There are also some 40GbE 300 meter rated (~$300): https://www.fs.com/products/137125.html?attribute&#x3D;32588&amp;id&#x3D;597711
 So my questions is. If these exist and work (they do work we tested). Why in the world are people running MPO cable between floors when two strands of LC can net you a 200gjg LAG?
 EDIT: I guess my bigger question is that I read about different types of MPO cabling and how some have more strands than the other. Like I think there is a 100gig MPO cable and a 40gig MPO cable. So I’m just really confused on how we are getting 100gig over a single LC connection.
 And I want to make sure LC over 100gig or 40gig is a supported and qualified technology.

                              <span>Hello folks,
 ​
 I&#x27;ve been struggling to come up with a solution to a problem I&#x27;m trying to solve.
 ​
 We have 2 locations, Data Center &amp; HQ. We have APs at both broadcasting the same SSIDs. At the DC, we have a Meraki MX64 concentrator, and at both locations we have Edge FortiGate Firewalls as an Active-Passive HA Pair.
 ​
 What we&#x27;d like to do is, for one of our SSIDs (let&#x27;s call it SSID1), broadcast it at both locations, give it its own DHCP Address Pool, send it to the MX64 concentrator, &amp; out to the Internet through the FortiGate. To accomplish this, I&#x27;ve created an Interface on the FortiGate, &amp; set it as a DHCP Server with the Subnet I want. I&#x27;ve connected the Meraki MX64 concentrator&#x27;s Internet Port to the FortiGate via our Core Switching Network, the Uplink IP is in the same Subnet &amp; the Gateway is the new interface I created on the Firewall.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve been trying this, but I&#x27;ve been hitting many roadblocks.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve created a test SSID at the Data Center &amp; when I implement, the folks there can&#x27;t see the SSID in their Wi-Fi list &amp; can&#x27;t connect to it if they try manually.
 ​
 I&#x27;d love to hear any ideas from those with bigger and brighter minds than mine!

For example, if a switch has been up for 16 weeks, and last input/output on a port is never, can I be confident that this port has, in fact, not been used the whole time the switch has been up?
 Or are there other things that can happen to reset those timers?

Our MSP wants to install meraki gear and I was recommended by others in the industry to install fortigate gear. I need some solid reasoning as to why we should go with one or the other.

                              <span>Hello,
 We are facing an a scalability limitation on our ACI fabric due to our implementation and I am curious if someone has seen a fabric above the Cisco advised &quot;limit&quot;.
 Here is a short story, what we have, and we are facing. We are running ACI version 4.2, which is acting as the transit for an NSX-T platform. Due to the implementation of the NSX solution, all of the ESXi hosts are both compute and edge nodes. So, the Edge VMs can shuffle around on the whole ESXi cluster. What this causes in 4.2 ACI, that we need to configure connected ESXi hosts * 2 BGP connectivity profile on each leaf of ours.
 Now this can be fixed with floating L3out on ACI version 5.2, but currently we are in the middle of APIC upgrade and then Fabric upgrade is next. (Corporate politics postponed this longer than should have).
 We realized as a new customer is coming, that we are getting to the advised limit by Cisco on 4.2 ACI.Verified Scalability Guide for Cisco APIC, Release 4.2(2), Multi-Site, Release 2.2(2), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches, Release 14.2(2) - CiscoNumber of BGP/OSPF/EIGRP session per L3 fabric are 3000.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/5x/verified-scalability/cisco-aci-verified-scalability-guide-521.html
 5.2 Jumps to 10000.
 We asked Cisco and the answer was kind enough to say &quot;Yeah, the huge jump to 10000 is because, we tested with 10000, and we just tested 5.2 more than 4.2&quot;.
 This doesn&#x27;t necessarily gives us the answer we were hoping for. Basically, we would like to know if someone faced this amount of configured BGP connections and went beyond the &quot;limit&quot;. We would like to know if any stability in the fabric occurred.

                              <span>Hi,
 Lately I have been struggling to choose the right layer 2 vendor (Cisco, Meraki, Ubiquiti Unifi, etc.) for SMB customers who own many switches (let&#x27;s say 20-30) and want central management for those devices so that you don&#x27;t have to SSH/Telnet to each every time you want to add a VLAN o change a port.
 I really line the simple pane of glass that Fortinet or Sophos gives you to manage Firewall/Router+Switching+APs but usually HW is too expensive for smaller customers.
 I like Ubiquiti Unifi&#x27;s APs but switches are very very limited and, as far as I see, don&#x27;t support stacking for Spine-Leaf design with the core switch formed by two or more stacked switches. The controller approach works very well for the APs and switches, but the later are somewhat still lacking features.
 Has anyone tried Cisco Business Dashboard? Does it really solve the issue to manage and monitor all your local switches from one place? Are the switches good for &quot;prosumer&quot; customers (they look like SF/SG replacements)
 Any other solution you hace tried to solve this that does not involve an enterprice plataform like HPE IMC or Cisco Prime?
 ​
 Thanks.
 J.M.

Don&#x27;t think we had the same issues with previous WiFi 5 units.
 The coverage in the area in question is brilliant, and in testing signal strength and quality of service with test kit on site I come back no fault found.
 Just want to reach out and see if people have experienced similar, my gut feel is try disabling WiFi 6 but I have no evidence to say why I am doing this. Or something else I&#x27;m not thinking of?

All connections pictured are layer-2 and all SVI&#x27;s exist on the New Core already. ToR and New Core are Juniper virtual chassis, old core is an HP. My initial thinking is:
 Configure xe-0/4 and xe-0/5 on new core and ToR for a LAG group with lower STP cost and bring those up leaving existing connections. Thinking traffic will then begin utilizing those links and I can safely disconnect the xe-0/0 and xe-0/1 connections.

 I&#x27;m new in an organization where there is no installed firewall and planning to implement one. Currently, we use Linksys LRT224&#x27;s VPN to connect to each other. Main site and branch office has both Dual-WAN running on Failover. 
 I plan on using PFSense&#x27;s Community Edition installed on a PC but not sure whether to put it behind the router or it should manage the Dual-WAN and then use the LRT224&#x27;s VPN as is. Which is better? 
 Thank you very much and sorry for the broken grammar.

I kinda felt like a dick but I am swamped and just have time in my day at work for my real job. I don&#x27;t do side gigs on personal computers anymore because I am not a miracle worker nor a babysitter. I charge 3x my hourly wage if I do agree to help someone as a consultant so why should I give it away for free?

 What MS seems to have done in these app execution aliases is set up a seperate listener (with sufficient permissions) that checks if the dummy executables was launched via a command pointing to an executable in the folder of a User Environment Variable, and if the execution alias is enabled. If both checks succeed, the listener launches the modern version of the app.
 The dummy .exe files are located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps and subfolder(s?)
 The App execution alias settings can be found in ms-settings:advanced-apps &gt; App execution aliases

                              <span>We have seen that Microsoft Word no longer allows staff to open a document and modify the contents if they do not have write access to the file. 
 This is a feedback portal page that discusses it: https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/idea/6d964886-c371-ed11-a81b-6045bdaf6a9e 
 ​
 Are others seeing this in the wild? Was this an intentional change? This seems like it would cause problems for a ton of users but I haven&#x27;t seen much talk about.

                              <span>I run a team of two, myself included for 250 users across the US. We have an MSP who was in place before I was with the company. Our president wants to ditch the MSP because he thinks $100k / year is too much. They handle network and server monitoring, firewall configs and monitoring, and on-premise and 365 backups. All 24/7.
 This discussion has been going on for years but now the heat has been turned up. How can I convince this guy that an already underpaid department can&#x27;t take all of that on without hiring a couple of people, which which would cost more than the MSP?
 Make it make sense, because my head is going to explode. For the record, I&#x27;m paid much less than the MSP.

We had a merger with one half windows and the other half of macs. The two IT teams just don&#x27;t get along. There is so much politics I&#x27;m over it. 
 Anyways. I&#x27;ve learned that there will be layoffs next month and I want to be included on it so I can bow out gracefully with a severance package (18 weeks + benefits). Has anyone successfully navigated on being ASKED to be included on the layoffs? 
 I mean, I have a another job lined up starting in the next month. I was going to do both to help pay off some debt but that big severance package would do the trick. Thoughts?

                              <span>Hey I get it... Sometimes the logs don&#x27;t tell you much... OR Maybe there aren&#x27;t any because someone turned them down or off.
 But uh... &quot;User can&#x27;t get X to work!&quot; Oh yeah interesting... Real interesting...
 Oh hmm right here in the console... &quot;Invalid credentials.&quot;. Oh hey look this thing also receives logs from on prem LDAP... Bad password attempts &quot;5&quot;... Didn&#x27;t even require a powershell look up of the user for bad password attempts.
 Oh man... remote user can&#x27;t connect to the vpn! That is bad... Oh hey can they ping the gateway @ whatever.fuckthegatewayaddressis.com? Oh man!! Look right there in the client logs it says can&#x27;t resolve the following address...
 Oh yeah look at that error code it just spat out... Maybe we should look to see if that tells us more than &quot;Doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;
 I understand the reach inside the grab bag of troubleshooting has it&#x27;s place... But quit making it my problem if your grab bag only ever holds 2 items to try and throw at the wall... Maybe go read the thing that tells you the exact F&#x27;ing issue.

                              <span>Greetings,
 Not sure this one entirely for just Sys Admins. I wanted to know how my fellow Sys Admins feel about education to advance your career? Would you choose the Certification(s) path or pursue a Degree? Both?
 I&#x27;ve been a Sys Admin for a number of years and decided to pursue my Degree in Cybersecurity. I&#x27;m in my 2nd year now. Lately I&#x27;ve been debating whether all the money I&#x27;m putting towards a Degree is worth it or not. My long term plan is to finish my Associates program and follow that will several certifications. Undecided whether I&#x27;ll go on to pursue my BA, mostly because of the money but my age has a lot to do with it as well. I&#x27;ll be turning 51 this year and don&#x27;t want to accumulate unnecessary debt unless I have confidence that there&#x27;s some type of ROI. Certs are cheaper for sure. 
 How do you all feel about this classic IT Professional debate?

                              <span>With the new Edge and the new Bing Discover Feature we detected some strange behaviour.
 If you visit google.de (german TLD) with a german browser it suggests the Wikipedia and Instagram of the german porn actress &quot;Fiona Fuchs&quot;.
 If you want to see it, here is a clip: https://imgur.com/a/Bz9N8wY
 Tested on multiple PCs with multiple OS in multiple Networks so we guess its a &quot;global&quot;-AI-Magic
 It seems like a new Edge profile is more likely to see this behaviour.
 ​
 Anyone else has has found such a weird behaviour?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 we had a recent problem with an user unable to change his own password via via Azure. He is a mac user and cannot directly change his password, due to no connection to our on prem AD. 
 We saw then that we haven&#x27;t activated &quot;password writeback&quot; in our Azure AD Connect. Lately we are getting more MacOS and Linux user and we thought that we should enable that feature and give the users more options, or better said easier options.
 First I found this article and did it step by step: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr-writeback
 Sadly after I activated the option in Azure AD Connect I got an error that password writeback couldn&#x27;t be enabled and that I should check the eventlog. Okay then I began my search in the eventlog.

 In the past week we&#x27;ve had double digit SharePoint/&quot;365 expired password&quot; phishing attempts. Considering we were seeing 2 a week until now, that&#x27;s a rather big jump

 Is there a license tier that is required for this to work - would it give me a different error in that case if we didn&#x27;t qualify to use it ?

                              <span>Hi,
 I just recently upgraded my SonicWALL NSA from a 2600 to a 3700. I have 2 users cannot connect to VPN through NetExtender using their home Wi-Fi, but if using an Ethernet cable it works just fine.
 The only correlation between the 2 users they both have Microsoft Surface. One has a Surface Laptop Studio (Win 11) and the other one has a Surface Book 3 (Win 10).
 I&#x27;ve tried multiple versions of NetExtender but to no avail. And I had both users power cycle their cable modems and wireless routers and still nothing.
 Any suggestions how to resolve this issue?

                              <span>Good morning all from Philadelphia!
 On an AAD-joined inTune-managed laptop, an AAD user&#x27;s profile went FUBAR, so I deleted the user using the local admin account, settings, system, advanced system settings, users. Logged off, intending to re-add the user. For no particular reason, I tried to log the user back on with his Win Hello PIN (which I knew because I had set him up and he hadn&#x27;t changed it). I was surprised that the login was successful; it went right to a new-user Windows Hello setup, where I reassigned him the same PIN.
 It&#x27;s concerning that the laptop cached the PIN after the user and profile were deleted. I wonder if I had waited, or rebooted, or ... something, if the PIN would have gone away. It strikes me as insecure.
 Does anyone know if this is expected behavior? Shouldn&#x27;t the deletion in Windows dig out and delete the PIN as well?

                              <span>I have a domain joined QNAP running latest QTS 5.0.1 which is domain joined to an Active Directory domain.
 Under Shared Folders on the Advanced Permissions I have both Enable Advanced Folder Permissions and Enable Windows ACL Support ticked.
 I have some shared folders including one called &quot;Test&quot;.
 I go to the Test folder in Windows Explorer on one computer and authenticate to the QNAP as an administrator then set the permissions on &quot;Test&quot; using the Windows Explorer Security tab and add my normal domain user account so it has read only access.
 So in Explorer my normal domain user account now shows on the whole of the &quot;Test&quot; folder tree on the Security tab in Windows Explorer.
 When I try to browse the QNAP using my normal domain user account from a domain joined workstation I can browse to \\qnap but as soon as I try to browse into &quot;Test&quot; I get prompted for credentials.
 Entering my normal domain credentials doesn&#x27;t work.
 Have I missed something please?

 Configured so that only users belonging to a specific AD group can connect to the SSID.
 ​
 But each user is prompted to either write his user+password or click &quot;Use my Windows user account&quot; to connect (the very first time). After that each time they connect if goes through automatically.
 Is there a way to always have the credentials submitted automatically after clicking connect if the domain user is logged on to Windows?

 ​
 wanted to pick your brains, I&#x27;ve got a user who just got a new computer. we did all the relevany updates etc and all is working smoothly, 
 apart from outlook, he only sees new emails when he restarts outlook. has anyone seen these behaviour before?
 EDIT: just logged on to his machine to see that his inbox is updating 3.2GB remaining..thats been a few hours now

                              <span>Hey everyone, just looking for some product recommendations. Like most orgs, we have a hybrid workforce with some days on site and some days working remote. Some of our productivity metrics are showing that some employees are really unproductive when working remotely and that has placed our WfH technology under a microscope. We currently don&#x27;t have decent insights into remote worker home network connections, so I&#x27;m looking for tools to help build out some metrics.
 Currently we are looking at Palo Alto Network&#x27;s ADEM addition to Prisma Access, PingPlotter Cloud, and ImUp.io. None of them are really thrilling me...
 ADEM is pretty expensive for what it does. It seems like it has a lot of promise of providing some sophisticated application performance metrics, but it is is really limited in …</span>

                              <span>Hi
 We&#x27;ve deleted a printer from a win10 pc. It is no longer visible in Control Panel - devices and printers or from Printers &amp; scanners in system settings.
 When printing from word, excel, outlook, etc., the printer is still showing with Delete 5 documents waiting message.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to remove the printer from this list. Any help pointing me in the right direction is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.
 ​
 SOLVED: I was able to find the printer in the Print Management app and once I cancelled all jobs, it was no longer listed when printing from other apps.

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone else had experienced issues with this set up.
 Basically when there is a power outage, despite the server being configured to automatically start, it does not when connected to the APC UPS. It works fine if it&#x27;s plugged into the mains, if the power is interrupted it starts up again.
 Not only does this happen, but also the UPS won&#x27;t deliver any power to the PSUs after the power comes back on. As a result I cannot even access iLO.
 In order to get the system to boot up again, I have to disconnect the power cables from the PSUs.
 Any insight would be helpful
 Thanks

                              <span>Morning admins
 I’m having an issue where some of my endpoints never seem to install the updates from my WSUS server. I have the GPOs setup and 90% of the machines check in and install fine. I have adjusted the GPO so the machines check in every 3 hours to try and force them to download while they are online at some point throughout the day. Previously was set to every 16 hours by the previous guy. 
 I have noticed the GPO was setup to auto download and schedule the install. The schedule install day is everyday and install time set to 10am. 
 Is there a way to get the updates auto install at any time in the day when they are available to the endpoints instead of the set 10am schedule. If a laptop comes online after 10am the updates won’t install until the following day assuming it’s online before that time. 
 Is there also a command I can run to force a machine to check for updates? I have used pswindowsupdate before using PDQ inventory to run a remote powershell command to check and install updates to the endpoints but from my understanding that doesn’t log in the update history under the updates settings tab in Windows. (I may be wrong)
 Appreciate any advice

 The want is to move away from lastpass because of reasons.
 The need is that it should be fairly easy to implement and the nice to have would be to be able to share specific user account passwords within the department (altho that might be &#x27;iffy&#x27; I guess.)

 My suggested solution to pushing new package updates is creating local repository, that is connected to internet, and all the other servers are connected to it.
 Is there more elegant solution than that?

 It appears there are populated lists under both Computer and User Configuration. 
 However, when I look at the exceptions list for Chrome to use as a reference, we can only click “show” for the User Config/Policies/Administrative Templates/Google/Google Chrome/Content Settings. We can not open this list under Computer Configuration. The button is greyed out.
 Why are these configured differently?

                              <span>Hi All
 Our facility company needs help and assistance with all our ISO requirements. Our compliance guy found ISMS Online but they are very very expensinve.
 Does anyone have any other alternatives or recommendations of similar platform that does similar job cheaper?
 (Sorry I didn&#x27;t actually had a demo with ISMS so not sure what everything they cover, just looking for alternatives.)
 Cheers

                              <span>My VMware host has 2 16-core processors. I want to buy the necessary Server 2022 standard licenses to be compliant. From what I understand, 1 16-core server 2022 standard pack allows for 1 physical install and 2 VMs. So if I buy 2 16-core standard licenses I should be covered. Correct? The 2 16-core licenses should cover the 32 physical cores correct? And allow for 4 VMs?

                              <span>A lot of where we are today professionally may be attributable to not necessarily WHAT we know, but WHO we know. That&#x27;s not to say that WHAT we know isn&#x27;t important - it certainly is.
 Ive been kicking around the idea of possibly starting up a Regional IT Professionals group that would meet up maybe once a quarter and chat.. or have a presenter on a topic.
 Has anyone out there in REDDIT land ever been part of organizing and/or running a group such as what I describe? Seems good on paper, but IT folks can be fickle. Thoughts?

My firm was heavy on full-stack management by application teams with mixed skillsets until the COVID retirement cliff hit, and after that we are starting to sort responsibilities between infrastructure, platform and application-level admins.
 Early December 2021, I go on a much-needed vacation and the first day, I find out about some plugin I&#x27;ve never heard of being the worst thing ever. I check our systems on VPN from the hotel, realize we&#x27;re screwed, and have ulcers the rest of the trip. January 2021, we patch the unused .jars and get that shit taken care of, but other teams in our same situation don&#x27;t know how to do the basics. Their &#x27;admins&#x27; are just web developers with server admin rights, and the guys and ladies they relied on for patching before …</span>

From my understanding its pretty straightforward with the desktop app as I create a customization and then push the customization file to users devices. Let me know if this is the wrong place to ask.

                              <span>So im looking to take advantage of the college tuition that my company will pay for, not looking to get anything like bachelor but figure it would be nice to take a fun associate or certificate degree program that could maybe compliment the already 10years of IT experience i already have. It&#x27;s down to 2, criminal justice or business admin/management as these i can mostly take online but i am open to other suggestions
 One reason being is I am really interested in the cyber seucirty sector of IT, i did get my security+ last year but have yet to land a job in that space. So i figure maybe i could get into forensic data science or similar. And the business administration or management is just a good all around degree to take, and also IT sales is a thing so it could help with that. Im curious what this sub thinks

 I sometimes find it quite overkill for what I&#x27;m trying to do. I use Microsoft To-do for a personal to-do list, and then find myself doubling up and duplicating tickets in Jira, or vice versa.
 How do you all use it?

                              <span>Hi, hope this isn&#x27;t out of scope for this sub.
 I&#x27;ve been asked by a client of mine to create a simple Web form that will be used to log daily work and materials used over the day for a small plumbing company, around 25 staff. Today this is done by filling out a form at the end of the day at the HQ and then the owner copies the papers manually over to Excel - and then he again manually creates invoices from that excel. He probably spends around 10-20 hours a week just doing this which is just bonkers.
 The form part seems simple and straightforward with Jotform for example but I wanted to check if you guys have any recommandations for other platforms that might be more suitable, and perhaps one that is easier to configure to dump the data straight into an Excel sheet with multiple pages/tabswithout going into too much much 3rd party autmation - if that is possible at all.
 Any ideas/thoughts appriaceted.

 This was causing issues since my banking site, mortgage site, and statefarm.com are all doing IP address checks against BrightCloud&#x27;s database and were not letting me log in.
 I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out trying to figure out where the source of this issue was. I did thorough scans of all machines in the house for malware. I even blocked all outbound mail ports in my firewall forcing everyone in the house to use webmail. I even went as far as analyzing packets leaving my network looking for any specious traffic that could be construed as phishing, but found nothing.
 This was happening every month…</span>

                              <span>Our cyber insurance renewal is coming up, and we are still kind of dealing with the requirements from last year. I am not sure if anyone else has insurance like this, but ours is requiring all administrative accounts to be protected by MFA. This includes:
  
Windows Servers
 Local Admin users
 NAS drives
 Linux
 Backups
 Network (Switches/Firewalls/Vmware etc)
 Along with anything that has any form of admin access, so like door access
  
A good portion of these we&#x27;ve been able to protect with a mixture of native built in MFA, others we&#x27;ve had to do a bit of juggling with the use of jumpboxes, but some of our infrastructure doesn&#x27;t have native MFA support. 
 I am currently in the process of talking to Duo about a possible solution, they claim they can pretty much MFA up any application. I would assume this is just sales jargon, or is there something I am just missing? I&#x27;m seeing documentation mention using a Radius server? This would also require the device/software to also support it? Or can Duo do something magical?

                              <span>I have a telco closet that has a few server in there. Trust me, I don&#x27;t want them in there either. The previously setup was a really off brand 1500VA UPS and 120V from the utility outlet in the room. Now, I have a 3000VA 208V ups and PDU in there for the switch gear. These last storms, the no name UPS caused the server to reboot every time it tried to switch to battery, as the batteries are probably lead-acid dust.
 I want to move the Dual PSU dell dervers from that unit to my 208V PDU. Dell appears to not let me use different input voltages across PSUs. WHY?!
 No amount of idrac configs on power configurations let me use the 208V. The green PSU light blinks a few times when connecting 208V power. I don&#x27;t care if these servers reboot, but from a technical perspective, how could I do a power migration without downtime?
 I see a few dell threads about not being able to use mixed supply voltages, and would like to know if anyone else beat this weird limitation? I have never had a problem with any other vendor using mixed 120V/240V/208V, and this is the first time I am seeing this.

                              <span>Hi all,
 What equipment or software do you all use for providing vendor access to your network? We are currently using Global Protect with a series of rules and HIP polices to check a vendor PC for security updates and AV, but I personally do not find this very easy to manage. It also brings up various other security concerns. Our vendors are mapping drives to their PCs and accessing internal web-services only.
 I am thinking of moving towards VM Jump boxes or an actual appliance for remote access. I&#x27;m curious what others have in place for a similar scenario.
 Thanks! 
 EDIT:
 This was an inherited process that I am trying to move away from for various reasons as many of you all posted in the comments. We have a few enterprise applications that can only be managed by the vendor. 
 We have LPA enabled with policies in the FW, but it is cumbersome and time consuming. 
 We&#x27;ve been looking at StrongDM, BeyondTrust, and I heard SecureLink out there too. This is the way IMO. So, any input on ZTNA or IAP would be much appreciated.

 Hi All,
 Is it possible to somehow allow a user to a specific UNC path through an application (an ERP we provide access to has shared files/folders configured at a UNC path; it&#x27;s required to be implemented this way through the ERP); however to *NOT* allow the user to navigate to the UNC path via Windows file explorer?
 So, for example, let&#x27;s say there is a PDF attached in the ERP system for a specific user at path \\server00\folder1\file1.pdf and if the user is within the ERP system, they attempt to access the PDF, it launches whatever the PDF application is and they are able to view the PDF successfully. However, we do not want the user to navigate manually to the path \\server00\folder\file1.pdf as there maybe something within \\server00 that we do not want the user to have access to.
 I can *probably* do individual permissions per user and it will work however...it&#x27;s over ~400 users and managing that will be a nightmare...
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to turn off UNC path access but allow it through the ERP application access. I know you can turn off UNC access via GPO and I tested this already but then it breaks the access through the ERP application when the user is logged in as well.
 Thanks for any feedback!

                              <span>First post here so be gentle 😁 We are a small MSP with aboud 1300 Windows 10/11 endpoints ranging from standalone, local AD domain joined, AzureAD joined and servers spread over around 80 customers. In order to prevent attacks like CVE-2023-23397 we want to block all outgoing SMB connections that are not going to private cidr ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0, etc..) entirely, blocking this attack vector for future vulnerabilities like this one. Preferably we would like to use the Windows firewall for this, because we have no control over home routers and blocking these connections from home workers using company laptops. We can however control the Windows firewall rules using powershell on all of our endpoints, but I cant seem to block outbound SMB connections at all. We want to deploy firewall rules using this example powershell:
 New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;Block SMB connections to public IP subnets&quot; -Direction Outbound -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 139,445 -RemoteAddress &quot;0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255&quot;,&quot;11.0.0.0-172.15.255.255&quot;,&quot;172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255&quot;,&quot;192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255&quot; -Action Block 
 It adds the block rule on top of the list wwith outbound rules, but somehow SMB connections keep working, even if I add our local NAS device to the RemoteAddress list.
  
Windows firewall is enabled
 Rule is present in all profiles
 ChatGPT had no useful tips for me 🫣
  
Anyone know how to do this using Windows firewall?

                              <span>Hi,
 We had one domain that had a different password expiration setting from our others. I changed the policy so that now they are all the same. However, my own Password Expires information is still set based on the old setting.
 Does this just take a while and eventually my expiration date will update to reflect the new setting? Or does the expiration date get set when you change the password and it won&#x27;t reflect the new setting until I change it next?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am not a developer and not very familiar with how it all works. I just need to install OpenJDK on some devices.
 We are deploying OpenJDK from Adoptium. No issues there.
 But I want to understand the differences between the various version.
 I understand that it is advisable to install the LTS version. That is fine.
 However, which version?
 If I install version 17. Will it be backwards compatible with apps requiring version 8? Can it break something if I upgrade from version 8 to 17?
 I can install them one next to the other. But what would be the use-case for that? Isn&#x27;t it cleaner to just keep one version installed?
 For someone that is not familiar with Java, it is very confusing. Hope some of you can shed some light on it. Would be highly appreciated.
 Thank you

                              <span>Trying to set up my workplace VPN on my laptop, I’ve used AnyConnect on my phone and iPad and in the past on chromebook, and its always fairly easy but windows 11 is giving me headaches.
 Hopefully someone here might be able to help..
 On mobile devices: Sign in with work credentials, it sends a 2FA auth to my phone, I accept/enter 2fa cade, and the VPN gets turned on
 On Windows, i go to the app and it takes me to Windows VPN settings.
 I set it up, enter my login info, then try to connect and it never tries to get my 2FA code, it’ll make the attempt but then says it failed or timed out.
 Does anyone know how to get 2FA to work with Windows 11 on Cisco AnyConnect VPN? 
 TIA

 Or is this a step than one should be accomplish right in installation process?
 I&#x27;m referring to Windows10/11 oses.

                              <span>Hey Everyone
 Long time lurker and this is my first time posting on here. I am 20M and will be graduating with my BSIT this December. As part of our degree program we are required to complete an internship. I recently received a job offer as an Intern where I will be working directly under a Senior Sys admin. I am a little bit nervous as this is not only my first job in IT but also my first Job in a professional office environment. I really want to do a good job and be a valuable member of the team but I am a little bit unsure what skills/technologies I am expected to be competent in as the job description was quite vague. I feel comfortable with basic stuff like configuring VMs and basic network troubleshooting but I definitely still have a lot to learn. I was wondering if anyone here could give me some advice as to what I should become familiar with before I start in May? What tools/technology’s do sysadmins use daily that would make me stand out if I am familiar with? Any advice anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for any formatting mistakes as I am on mobile. Thank you.

We upgraded over the weekend and since then we&#x27;ve seen a lot of connectivity issues with client applications. E.G Our live chat operator console can&#x27;t reach the server, Sage Applications are unable to talk to Sage, one of our dev&#x27;s has had issues reaching Debian, etc.
 Going to roll back this evening but anyone else experiencing issues?

                              <span>We are trying to plan for the demise of Windows 10.
 Does anyone know whether there will be another version of Windows 10 after 22H2? I can&#x27;t find a yes, or no, anywhere.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information says 22H2 ends on 13 May 2025, buy says nothing about any future releases.
 https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785452/microsoft-windows-10-future-feature-updates-annual-2022 says 14 October 2025, but I don&#x27;t know where they get that date from.
 https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/microsoft-will-continue-supporting-windows-10-with-yearly-feature-updates/ also says October 2025, but again I don&#x27;t know where that date comes from. 
 There a few other sites with October 2025 as well.
 So Microsoft says a hard end date for 22H2. But will there be a future release? And where does the October 2025 date come from?
 Any links to sources, especially Microsoft, would be most helpful. Thanks

                              <span>We have two Windows servers (running Server 2022) handling DHCP in a load balance scenario currently. We&#x27;d like to migrate to hot standby in order to troubleshoot some issues we are having with some clients.
 What is the process for doing so? Would we need to modify the existing IP helper commands we have on VLANS that are pointed to those two DHCP servers? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there, 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve got the follwoing problem. 
 ​
 We have a customer who fused with another Company. 
 They are connected via IPSEC and some resources like Ticketing system is only available via Internal IP example: ticket.corp.com -&gt; 10.10.10.10
 Some resources for Marketing and such are hosted in Azure like marketing.corp.com -&gt; 20.30.40.50
 Now.
 ​
 If I create a Zone on my DNS Server which holds corp.com then I need to add all known A records and such, right ?
 Zonetransfer isn&#x27;t an option since the other corp still has another MSP and they aren&#x27;t really of the fastest type.
 ​
 What would be a good route here ?

 This seems to impact .Xlsm spreadsheets that have api calls. If anyone remembers that issue in January where .lnk files got deleted by the definitions update, this is the same vibe but doesn’t seem to be reported by Microsoft yet. 
 Also, if anyone has a workaround I’d love that :)

 We have a lot of Microsoft Surface devices, most of which I&#x27;ve inherited. I&#x27;ve dealt with the inability to replace the stupid glued-on keyboards, get at the insides or replace cracked screens. I&#x27;ve never understood why, but worked around, that a reinstall of W10 from a standard USB stick doesn&#x27;t include drivers for the touchscreen, keyboard or mouse and there&#x27;s only one fucking USB slot on the side. It&#x27;s your fucking operating system you halfwits and you can&#x27;t even include basic drivers for your own fucking hardware. I just can&#x27;t even.
 Today I&#x27;ve taken my first delivery of three Surface Laptop 4 devices. They&#x27;ve got the usual lack of chipset drivers with the new lack of any network drivers whatsoever. Gets better - the only way I can seemingly get Surface drivers from Microsoft is to download a helpful executable or MSI, that then checks whether I&#x27;m on a Surface Laptop 4 (spoiler: I&#x27;m not) and then refuses to let me have the contents. I can&#x27;t even &quot;unzip&quot; it as the CABs inside obfuscate the filenames so they&#x27;re useless.
 FOR FUCKS SAKE MICROSOFT. SORT YOUR SHIT. I&#x27;VE BEEN THE GUY QUIETLY STICKING UP FOR YOU SINCE BEFORE YOU SHIPPED THE COMPLETE CLUSTERFUCK THAT WAS WIN95A OR WHEN I HAD TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO ARSE ABOUT WITH GETTING 3.1 ON A NETWORK. I&#x27;m tired of having to increasingly try to work around you &quot;making life easier&quot; for me. I&#x27;m tired of you renaming and reorganising everything every three months but not updating your documentation. I&#x27;m just tired.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working with a team of 14 people who primarily focus on Windows servers, and we&#x27;re facing issues with tracking script ownership, purpose, and necessity over time. This leads to confusion and inefficiency, and we primarily use PowerShell for scripting. I&#x27;m looking for a free tool to help manage automated scripts for our team.
 Ideally, the tool should offer central management for creating scheduled tasks, associate each script with a person and description, and run scripts from a central source. We tried Rundeck, but it was too complicated for our needs. 
 Can anyone recommend a free tool that would be suitable for our team size and focus on Windows servers? Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Does anyone have a tip, trick, lifehack,.... for detaching the ethernet cable from the spring loaded ethernet ports? I assume I don&#x27;t need a screwdriver to force the clip more open so I can detach the cable?
 I understand that manufacturers want to have a small formfactor but these ports are getting ridiculous.

 I need to create a network diagram for the company where I work (small network: 3 physical servers, about 20 VPS, 4 switches and something else).
 In you experience do I need to create a logical diagram (LAN, VLAN, VPS, etc.) or it&#x27;s better to have also a physical one (with all the switches, all the physical servers, etc.)?

 If I select Allow org to manage device it fails with error 8018001C. This error is basically pointing towards not having Intune or MDM, MAM enabled and DNS records setup but they are.
 So is my thinking correct because its a session and not a device because its on a RD server is this the reason its happening? If I select app only it works fine so just want to know really for my own knowledge.

                              <span>Hiya All,
 Going round in circles so thought to ask the knowledgeable.
 I normally do this with my eye&#x27;s closed but this is an inherited site and there&#x27;s clearly something different I&#x27;m missing! 
 Server 2019.
 Our RDS SSL has expired, and I&#x27;ve got the new cert, added it to IIS on the Gateway. 
 I&#x27;ve then gone into RDS Gateway Manager, saw the warning about the SSL expiry.
 Went into properties, SSL tab, import, imported new certificate.
 Users who have a RDP connection on their desktop working fine.
 Users who use the rdweb connection, login to the site fine, download the RDP file, and - it says the cert is expired. It still shows the old cert in the downloaded RDP file. 
 All my bindings look correct. 
 Unless this server has something else in the mix I&#x27;m missing, any ideas why this isn&#x27;t working?

                              <span>TL;DR
 Which hypervisor has the best passthrough?
  
A PC failed. Running windows xp connected through USB to some exact measuring large machine and having license usb dongle plugged in the usb.
 A quote came back from the company that installed it and its like 15,000€ for upgrade. This is eastern europe so multiple it by 10.
 Waned to give it a try and move the machine to a VM, and Disk2vhd worked and I am playing with windows xp in a hyperv. 
 But apparently hyperv sucks when it comes to passing through USB. So next try is virtual box or esxi or proxmox/qmeu/kvm,... which with me having vhdx should not be difficult to move to.
 So anyone got some experience with usb passthrough in to VMs that is most reliable? I am thinking that option is also to get some PCIE usb card and that could be passedthrough too, As it works nicely with esxi and HBA cards in IT mode.

                              <span>My company just took over 9 remote OT (industrial control of manufacturing) sites that were each previously independently, locally maintained. We are not going to rebuild them or force standardization except when systems are due for replacement. My first goal was security monitoring which is setup and shows there are challenges in the reliability of these networks. My next step is to setup centralized monitoring of network and hardware health. One site has PRTG already but in a half baked setup. Licensing across all these locations can be tricky and slow process due to the countries they are in. I wrote a plan to use Zabbix on all sites and am vetting a few experts to assist now. Does anyone have positive experience or nightmares about Zabbix for such a project?

                              <span>Greetings, Wondering if anyone else have seen our scenario last two weeks? We have had 7 situations were the client (Windows server 2019/2022 fully patched, static assigned IP) have deleted it owns A record, much similar with this one (except the windows versions..) https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/dns-host-record-of-a-computer-is-deleted-after-you-change-the-dns-server-assignment-f132a1fe-4867-df2b-a5fc-37557990d518
 The 7 situations have happened in 7 different ADs/VLAN with no connection to each other. DNS Scavaging is configured. The one oddly thing is that all these 7 servers are RD/GW/CB in a RDS farm (not the same farm, we have a farm in each AD/VLAN).
 Extremely weird and frustrating - any ideas? We have enabled DNS Client Events logging on two servers in a VLAN were it has not occurred yet.
 The solution so far has been to simple run &quot;ipconfig /registerdns&quot;.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 We had a cowboy work for us a while ago who, somehow, was able to give himself owner permissions to everyones onedrive. Although the account is disabled and poses no risk, the business would like this owner permission removed from everyone&#x27;s account. We&#x27;ve taking a look at the sharepoint site permissions and can&#x27;t find where or how he has done this. We know he&#x27;s applied it to a top level somewhere as new accounts also have him included as the owner permission.
 I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this bloody permission and I can&#x27;t find it in the sharepoint admin centre, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not something that was applied in the old Onedrive admin centre that doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, if someone can help point me in the right direction that&#x27;ll be appreciated.
 Cheers

                              <span>I am using WinSCP on Windows 10 to transfer/sync files between my local machine and a remote cluster - my remote cluster is in a different time zone. Each time I am using Synchronization, it wants to transfer all files because time stamps are different for both. It is not too bad, and I can just remove the &quot;Modification time&quot; as &quot;Comparison Criteria&quot; but then the files which have genuinely been updated will also not be synced. Does anyone know how to &#x27;fix&#x27; this?

I’ve enabled it to be allowed on the Hyper-V Desktop.
 Can anyone help me get audio in or out to work? Any help will be greatly appreciated!!

                              <span>Hi
 Apologies if this post meanders.
 I&#x27;m mostly network orientated, with a few Cisco certs but I see a lot of network jobs requiring on-call. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now and just met someone and don&#x27;t want this on-call stuff now. I have multiple area that I&#x27;m interested in, my latest Cisco cert being the DevNet Associate as I&#x27;m increasingly becoming more and more interested in a Python orientated job. However, I&#x27;m more geared towards using it for automation and DevOps kind of stuff, though I am also learning Django for a possible business idea, and I have an real interest in ML.
 Anyway, back to my original thought, my interest in networking has seriously waned over the last few years and was looking at cloud. I read that AWS is king of cloud platforms, however I also notice that here in the UK, I hardly ever see job requiring AWS, the vast, vast majority want Azure.
 Now I know as far as the customer is concerned, the difference between them at first glance is mostly aesthetic; different interface etc.
 Given that I really like working with Python, rather than Powershell, what would be a better option between AWS and Azure?

                              <span>Don&#x27;t know if anyone has ever been through this before, but we keep getting complaints from one of our company&#x27;s chairmen about Microsoft Teams getting cut while they&#x27;re using it on calls/meetings (on LAN), the thing is, they don&#x27;t lose network access, but the call still drops out and they get that &quot;slow connection &quot; error, it works fine on his phone, but not on his super laptop, doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.
 Have anyone ever been through something similar?

 My line in and a P2P line happen to be in someone&#x27;s office. There&#x27;s currently a 9U network rack in there and I was wanting to know if anyone has any experience with acoustic network wall rack or helping dampen the sound from a network rack.
 Any advice would be great!

 I look at the GPO, and it looks correct. I look at the registry settings, and they make sense.
 Yet, on each scheduled evening of updates, nothing happens.
 Where have I gone wrong? Someone put me out of manual update hell!
 Mixture of Windows Server 2016 and 2019 servers. 47 servers in total, not getting updates on any of them :(
 No WSUS, direct to MS.
 Settings are:
  
Common GPO applied to all servers
 Example GPO applying updates per group of servers
 gpresult /h on a server, showing settings applied
 Resultant registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU
 Pastebin of Windows Updates logs. Was scheduled for 23:00, this is the closest set of logs thereafter
  
I&#x27;ve done a set of updates manually since applying the above settings. I&#x27;ve rebooted. I&#x27;ve checked the Windows Update service is running. There are updates waiting to be installed.
 Driving me mad.

 Hope you are having a chill day. 
 I was stupid enough to map a server to multiple users using a script that is placed in the startup folder.
 Now the time for migration has come and a new server has to be mapped instead of the old one.
 The new server is being mapped through the active directory using a script as well but they are interfering with each other.
 I use AD because I don&#x27;t have access to policies. 
 What would be your best way of removing a script from multiple users&#x27; startup folders, without manually doing it on each laptop? 
 Thanks to all in advance.

                              <span>TLDR; Microsoft Sucks, unsurprisingly 
 The past few months I&#x27;ve been elbow deep in Teams Calling and Intune MDM configuration.
 There seems to be alot of missing functionality missing, for example, in a Teams Auto Attended configuration, if a caller doesn&#x27;t press a number for an option, Teams will just drop the call instead of having an option to push the call to a call queue. What if someone has accessibility problems that don&#x27;t allow them to press or speak a number?
 For Intune, when you enrolled a device that is set to join a dynamic group based on the enrolment profile name, the initial configuration policy won&#x27;t apply, as the dynamic rules aren&#x27;t processed fast enough. 
 Surely a global billion dollar company would have the ability to plan the development scope and functionality testing.
 It&#x27;s ironic how they are trying to force you to thier cloud offerings but can&#x27;t even flesh these products out fully.
 Rant over.

                              <span>Hi,
 Does anyone know how to add a product image/photo to an inventory SKU label? I have been playing around with Dymo Connect, Zebra Designer on Microsoft and the Avery Design &amp; Print website. Using the database function I can create unique SKU labels with OEM automative part numbers, SKU barcodes and qr codes to URLs from an excel spreadsheet.
 I can also add numerical counters to these functions. Making them sequential off the excel cell data which represents each donor vehicles individual ID number.
 What I would love is to add a product image to the label which is also the first image on the eBay listing.
 I can&#x27;t seem to embed any images into the excel cell. All 3 label making softwares are reading the image from the database as text and displaying &#x27;picture&#x27; instead of the image.
 I can manually add images to each label but it will take way too long. I would much prefer the images automatically generate onto each new label as the barcodes and other data does.
 Can anyone help me out or point me in the right direction?
 Thank you

I did notice my BIOS resetting last few weeks which would have been caused by the failing CMOS battery not holding a charge anymore when the pc was off.

                              <span>So my team is looking for an alternative to VMware since they changed their licensing model, which will enormously increase our operational costs. So I am currently researching alternatives. I have zero experience with other virtualization solutions, but am pretty proficient in the VMware products (even hold a cert). So I hope a lot of the concepts are transferable to other vendors.
 The thing is: My research mostly led me to Proxmox or Hyper-V, for example, in home labs or rather small environments. Our environment is fairly large tho (about 200 hosts), so I am wondering, if solutions like the aforementioned are even scaleable to such an environment. Does anyone have any experiences with alternative virtualization products (HyperV, KVM, Proxmox, Nutanix, Citrix) on an industrial scale and can point me in a recommendable direction?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 In your opinion, what would be the best stable firmware version for Catalyst 9500.
 Our requirements would only run routing protocol, QoS and port aggregation?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on an RFP to re-fiber my org&#x27;s main building. We are hub and spoke, with the datacenter in the basement and four closets, one on each of three upper floors with the fourth in an wing off the 1st floor. 
 Previous guy put in multimode fiber to all the IDFs, and it&#x27;s only OM1. That was over 20 years ago. I&#x27;m pushing gigabit over it without issue, but want to go to 10g this year and work towards 25g in the near future, with 100g in the next ten years. So I&#x27;m planning to bring in contractors for a rip and replace, out with the multi and in with single mode.
 Question is, how many strands? I know could push 100s of gigs over a single strand, but that is $$$$$ carrier grade stuff... I&#x27;m looking for something more in the practical range, so that is duplex LC, or MPO/MTP, for speeds of 25g to 100g based on the Aruba equipment I have right now. 
 Looking at material cost, there&#x27;s not a big difference between 6 and 12 strands armored plenum rated OS1. This is a fairly small job, short runs (longest is 400 meters). So labor is going to be more expensive than materials by my estimate. Looking at bulk cabling, I also see pre-terminated MPO/MTP 12 strand cable. Paired with fiber tray cassettes that accept MPO and break out into six duplex LC connectors, it seems to make sense for a degree of future proofing. I can use the LC breakout in the short term, and the higher density MPO connection is there for the future. The cassette system also seems nice, I can change the breakout if needed, without having to splice anything new.
 What would the downside of 12 strand be over 6 strand? Is there a downside to MPO vs LC terminations on the cable itself. Is there a downside to a breakout cassette versus spliced terminations?

                              <span>This is a bit of an odd question but bear with me for a second.
 Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a router with three discreet Ethernet ports (each port can be its own network with a different subnet/supernet).
 Now let&#x27;s say that all of these interfaces/subnets are using non RFC1918 IPs.
 So for example let&#x27;s say 
  
interface 1 is: 75.168.2.x/24, 
 
interface 2 is 189.54.67.x/24
 
interface 3 is 7.90.85.X/24
 
 If an IP in the Interface 1 subnet sends traffic to an IP in the Interface 2 subnet will the router send that traffic internally between the discreet? Or will it attempt to send that traffic to the real location of that Dst IP?
 In short the router should know that 189.54.67.x/24 is being used for resources internally and the should send it inside rather than out, but with it crossing discreet NICs I wasn&#x27;t sure.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to write a python script that will get the &#x27;Arp table dump&#x27; for a given Edge device on the network. Or, simply just be able to do a post request in Postman to retrieve this information for a given Edge.
 Looking through the documentation I can&#x27;t find any methods in the REST API documentation for getting remote diagnostic data from Edge devices.
 I&#x27;ve been able to pull down data like Edge name and physical interface status using /getEdge but what would be great is to get the live data diagnostic data too.
 The VCO version is 4.3.1
 Anyone know if this possible?

                              <span>Apologies in advance, I’m not a network guru. I’m only knowledgeable enough to be dangerous. 
 One of our clients has a few hundred streaming devices on their network. They asked if we could help give them a list of these devices, with their host name, IPV6 address, and MAC address, so they can do some forensics on an issue they are tracking. 
 We have the hostnames, and we can get the IPV6 address from there. We also have a list of the MAC addresses, but not coordinated with the hostnames. The devices do NOT have IPV4 addresses. 
 I’ve been trying to Google my way through this, but each hopeful answer I come upon doesn’t seem to work. Mostly they revolve around the “ip -a neigh show” command in some way, all saying that it should provide similar info to “arp -a” for IPV4. I do not, however, see any results that include a previously pinged IPV6 address or hostname. 
 I’m hoping there is another command, or even a different software/utility, I can use. Any help or tips would be appreciated.

                              <span>I have a Nokia 7360 ISAM that I am trying to get running as an E/GPON OLT. I&#x27;m mostly there but am stuck on one part, I cannot get the XFP ports on the NT card to link up. They do report received light from the far end but they are not transmitting any light:
  position : nt-a:xfp:1 diag-avail-status : no-error los : no-los tx-fault : no-tx-fault tx-power : &quot;No Power&quot; rx-power : &quot;-6.12 dBm&quot; tx-bias-current : &quot;0.00 mA&quot; supply-voltage : &quot;3.31 VDC&quot; temperature : &quot;22.00 degrees Celsius&quot; temperature-tca : normal-value voltage-tca : normal-value bias-current-tca : low-alarm-th tx-power-tca : low-alarm-th rx-power-tca : normal-value rssi-profile-id : 65535 rssi-state : disable 
 In the tx-power field it says &quot;No Power&quot; and I have confirmed nothing is being outputted with a light meter. The interfaces are administratively up.
 This is the first time I&#x27;ve worked with any Nokia gear so it&#x27;s entirely possible I&#x27;m missing something basic, but I can&#x27;t find anything that looks relevant in the command tree.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I run a bar/restaurant and we have a total of 12 Smart TV&#x27;s that have Fire Sticks connected to each one. We have the Netgear Nighthawk (RAX120) router. The wifi signal is just not strong enough to run that many devices, especially streaming HD video. We are purchasing the Ethernet adapters for all of our Fire Sticks and will be hard wiring them individually. I will need a total of 2 switches to accomplish this, and have a few questions about compatibility and ease of use. Below is the configuration I will need:
 1 line out of the Nighthawk Router into the first switch. The first switch will feed 4-5 devices and the second switch. The second switch will feed 8-9 devices. All of the devices in question will be Fire Sticks. (I could feed the second switch from another port on the router if that would be a better solution.)
 1) I cannot think of a need for a PoE switch or a managed switch. Is there any reason why I may need one of those or can I use a Smart or Unmanaged Switch?
 2) Are these switches stackable and does my configuration sound correct or require any additional configuration?
 3) Which switches would work best with my specific router?

 PayloadType: com.apple.wifi.managed AutoJoin: true DomainName: networkprovider.com EAPClientConfiguration: UserName: username UserPassword: password AcceptEAPTypes: 21 (EAP-TTLS) PayloadCertificateAnchorUUID: uuid of packaged cert TTLSInnerAuthentication: MSCHAPv2 TLSTrustedServerNames: networkprovider.com, *.networkprovider.com OuterIdentity: anonymous@networkprovider.com EncryptionType: WPA IsHotspot: true ServiceProviderRoamingEnabled: true NAIRealmNames: networkprovider.com DisplayedOperatorName: Network Provider ProxyType: None _UsingHotspot20: true 
 The profile also packages a PKCS1 cert.
 I&#x27;ve never touched a HS 2.0 network before from either side (as a user or operator), but I am interested in learning more about it!

 The cables in to the patch panel are properly shielded cat5/6s.
 I will not be running poe.

                              <span>Typical network design calls for a 3-tier or collapsed-core topology. However, if you have a small datacenter, 2 or 3 racks, with a pair of Nexus core switches with VPC, what are the drawbacks of bringing all endpoints, mainly servers, directly to the core? In the old days, you would put FEX at top of each rack but those are basically line cards and all switching still happens at the core. Let&#x27;s just imagine that cross-connects are not an issue so you can run cables from whatever devices on each rack directly to the core. With 2 core switches, you can have up to 96+ ports so port capacity should not be an issue. Properly managed, you can limit broadcast domains and access. I&#x27;ve seen arguments regarding TCAM and backplane throughput. Core switches should be non-blocking anyway. What else is there?

 In Cisco documentation, I see little in terms of disabling the interface and why it is on. I noticed in the document that it says &#x27;Supervisor 1 requires disabling Slot 4 port 48 (if applicable) to enable AppGigabitEthernet port&#x27;. Is it possible to disable it? Why is it turned on? Can I run some commands to confirm?
 Again i did not turn this interface on :(

                              <span>This might be an r/sysadmin question, but I figure it&#x27;s more of a network question because it deals with 802.1X and device authentication:
 Currently wrapping up work on 802.1X authentication for a client and we&#x27;re using Windows NPS to authenticate MAC addresses for those few devices that either don&#x27;t have certificate support or are too old to use modern encryption standards (please no comments about how this is bad practice - we know, but we&#x27;re forced to play the hand we&#x27;re dealt...)
 For MAC address authentication, this requires creating user objects where both the username and password are the MAC address in question. This works fine.
 However, I&#x27;d like to plan ahead and not have to bug the client every quarter to find out which of these MACs aren&#x27;t needed anymore. Basically, if a device doesn&#x27;t re-authenticate w/in 7 days, I want to have to manually add it back.
 Even though these MAC addresses are basically AD user accounts, when they&#x27;re authenticated by NPS, none of their AD properties change, so I can&#x27;t just poll the last login date. Right now, I&#x27;m working on some powershell to scrape 7 days of event logs and remove anything without a successful NPS login. This should work, but I feel like this might be &#x27;hard mode&#x27;, so to speak. Is there a simpler way I&#x27;m not thinking of?

 Have requested 10G IP transit with multiple burst variants and receive no quotes or only after several weeks of waiting.
 In my opinion, a very simple product, the price of which should be known.
 Many places praise their customer support and infrastructure, but the sales people make it hard for me to get in.
 Is it just my NTT rep?
 Other carriers like Arelion send a quote within a few days.

 Now when I plug the media converter port to my access port, STP reports port BROKEN for &quot;Shr *TYPE_Inc&quot; so it doesn&#x27;t work. My understanding is that the other end is trunking and im doing access port so it&#x27;s expected behavior. 
 Now can someone confirm if I&#x27;m understanding this correctly and why this is working fine when connected to a router port? Also works if I skip the switch and plug directly into the port of one of the firewalls in the cluster (probably same reason why it works on router port).
 Switch port config:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/18 description 160-VLAN switchport access vlan 160 switchport mode access speed 100 end 
 Router port config:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 description WAN ip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.248 ip nat outside speed 100 no negotiation auto 
 What throws me off it when the media converter is plugged to my switch, the other end (what I see as gtw) can ping my firewall interface correctly but I can&#x27;t ping them (again, that gtw). 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello community, I’m seeking some assistance in a setup for replication of a L2 pseudowire service.
 Scenario: I have a 10G fibre that carries the following:
  
Untagged: General traffic, multiple subnets, routed
 VLAN1998: customer X branch 1
 VLAN1999: customer X branch 2
  
What’s at the other end of this fiber is not really relevant but for context it is a CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System) and then downstream of that multiple cable modems. This is also not a production environment, the goal here is for me to troubleshoot something downstream of the CMTS, on the cable modem itself but I need the full environment to replicate. Because this is a lab, it is all fairly low volume (about 100 Mbps).
 The 2 VLANs are essentially customer LAN extensions where the customer purchases a circui…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been recommend this unit to replace one of our aging transit routers. I was originally quoting the NCS-5501 but this has more capacity and more 100Gb ports at a MUCH cheaper price due to some heavy Cisco discounts. 
 The thing is of course is it&#x27;s quite a new device. Anyone here been using one of these and have any warnings I should make note of? 
 I&#x27;ll be using it as a Transit router/route reflector on a MPLS (LDP) network. Replacing our ASR1002.

 I have other servers that are in a VPC with the first server but they are not able to access the Site to Site Network. How do i make them access it? I want to share the first servers access with them perhaps through some routing or proxy or any other means.

 What connectors and tools do you all recommend??

 The question here, what is the normal range that is acceptable with our module, example its fluctuation between 0.5 to 1 or below that?
 As I am monitoring my 10KM sfp x4 I saw that 3x sfp fluctuate between 0.5 and 1 with 30mins timeframe, and 1 fluctuate 0.5 to 1.8 with 30 minutes timeframe.
 Module: TR-FF13L-N00 50gb/s 1311 LC10KM(SMF) 
 Thanks, you.

 I have Device A (a camera) connected to port 1 and Device B (my PC) connected to port 2. Device A was statically configured with an incorrect IP, where as Device B has an IP that falls within my network.
 On Device B I am able to discover Device A. I&#x27;m assuming this is done through multicast, but if both devices are in separate networks, and Device A doesn&#x27;t even have a gateway, how is it possible that there&#x27;s discovery?

                              <span>Good evening everyone,
 I&#x27;m a sys admin troubleshooting a PXE server on one of my networks. Our service desk team is having issues using MDT to provision client computers (We are unable to use MECM / Intune for these at this time). Anyway, the long and short of it is that some workstations are able to contact the MDT server and others aren&#x27;t. The ones that aren&#x27;t are still able to contact the DHCP server located in the same subnet. Workstations receive an IP address, and then a message stating that &quot;No boot offers were received.&quot;
 Here&#x27;s a brief overview of this network:
 Workstations connected to CISCO L2 edge switches scattered across the building.
 CISCO Edge switches connected to CISCO two core routers in HSRP
 Core Routers connect to a juniper SRX firewall
 Server VLAN &#x3D; 123.123.2.0/2…</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s discuss IT certifications!
 When I was going through college I had the A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA, etc.
 This put me ahead of the other applicants. It helped me get into some good jobs. 
 Now a decade later...
 Recently I&#x27;ve got 3 certifications. They haven&#x27;t done shit for me. It&#x27;s good to show I still learn.
 I was going for the CCNP-ENT, then CISSP, DC, SEC, etc.
 But in reality, nobody cares. They only care about experience after so many years it seems. 
 Half the guys we interview with CCNP can&#x27;t explain what a VLAN is and what it does. It really gives IT certifications a bad name. I used to love them, but have decided to learn programming python and network automation instead. Maybe I&#x27;ll get a cert in the future, maybe not. 
 You have to keep renewing them too. That&#x27;s a huge pain in the ass. At least Cisco let&#x27;s you learn new material and get those certifications updated. 
 In summary I think certifications are great to get you in and if your company requires it and pays for it plus a raise. Otherwise I think if you have a decade or more of experience it is useless. 
 What your your thoughts?

 But when I bind an app, OBS Studio, to use 10.13.2.206 it is failing to connect seems like no connection thru VPN. I don&#x27;t want to use default gateway for VPN because I want all my traffic, except for OBS Studio to run thru wifi, 192.168.100.73.

 Currently I have some FortiGate products in use. I was wondering what some recommendations might be as an alternative or if I should just stick with what we’re using already for a new network deployment.

                              <span>We&#x27;re about to do a major refresh and I feel like the 9410 platform is getting long in the tooth. We ought to be due for new hardware sometime in the next year or two at the latest. Does anyone have any information on what&#x27;s next and when? I really don&#x27;t want to drop 7+ million on these chassis and wind up with 5 years until end of hardware support.

                              <span>I have a new server I went to setup to our network (Levovo) which has within it an 01PE411 networking card which refused to connect to our switch onsite, being an EN-3026P - no lights at all indicating communication. 
 After replacing the network card thinking it was faulty, we tried on a basic $80 TP-link switch and it works fine. I can also connect that switch to the main switch and now it all works fine - except can someone explain specifically what&#x27;s happening between these two devices? 
 Trying to work out if best to replace the switch, or if its the network card that is problematic, but I can&#x27;t work out which is causing it. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 Beyond DNAC, we&#x27;re starting to look at what Cisco has suggested for replacing SNMP for Wireless client monitoring, the YANG model stuff and using the telemetry subscriptions to retrieve/store and graph data. In full disclosure, we&#x27;ve had some internal talks with Cisco and have built a few prototypes using this great tutorial as a guide:
 ​
 https://www.wifireference.com/2020/01/14/viewing-network-telemetry-from-the-catalyst-9800-with-grafana/
 ​
 ​
 I&#x27;ve built this on a prototype and had a group with a lot more programming chops build the infrastructure and I&#x27;m getting to the point where the controller (for whatever reason) decides to close the connection and never re-establishes until I remove the config and re-add it (most likely just the receiver bit):
 test-9800-wlc-01#sh telemetry ietf subscription 30 re
 Telemetry subscription receivers detail:
 ​
 Subscription ID: 30
 Address: 1.1.1.1
 Port: 57000
 Protocol: grpc-tcp
 Profile:
 Connection: 12543
 State: Disconnected
 Explanation: Unknown reason
 ​
 This is the one subscription (I&#x27;d love to get 2-3 but I can&#x27;t get one data set stable):
 ​
 telemetry ietf subscription 30
 encoding encode-kvgpb
 filter xpath /wireless-client-oper:client-oper-data/common-oper-data
 source-address 2.2.2.2
 stream yang-push
 update-policy periodic 6000
 receiver ip address 1.1.1.1 57000 protocol grpc-tcp
 ​
 (I redacted info - apologies if i inadvertently removed anything). I have confirmed through a packet capture that the data is not leaving the controller.
 ​
 Has anyone else run into these issues? I really hate to get to the point where every 4-6 hours I go in and re-issue the configs but I feel like we&#x27;re stuck here. I have two controllers - one running 17.3.5(b) with non 6e APs and I&#x27;m going to try it on my 17.9.2 controller running minimal 6e APs. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s load related.
 ​
 I do have a Cisco TAC case but since it&#x27;s not a P1/P2, it&#x27;s best effort with an already overloaded TACc team.

 Our studies concern the entire iso/osi model.
 I was thinking at least 4 routers, 4 switches and 2 access point wifi.
 They must be configurable, affordable, and available to buy new in stores.
 Which models and brands to consider?
 Thanks for your help

                              <span>*i have already posted it in data centre subreddit but this subreddit is more active in my experience and i am okay with any constructive criticisms, but i so tired of updating excelsheet everyday in the name of audit reports.
 So tomorrow by EOD our team will be submitting the budget for next year as fiscal year is about to come to end. I have been eyeing at netbox but our leadership insisted that we need active support for the NRM tool as we are already thinned out in our daily tasks, weekly, monthly and quarterly activities along with mitigation activities whenever security team highlights any issues on the network end.
 Our infra consists of fortigate fw, analyzer, nexus switched , a bunch of l2, l3 catalyst switches , along with idrac, vsphares and shit tonn of vms and LBs . We maintain all this data mostly on Excel which i and many of our team find very tedious and prone to errors. Recently our security team has brought in axonious but it&#x27;s under their domain and from DC ops team perspective we are left with poorly maintained Excel sheets. I am hoping to get some decent suggestions for NRM tool with licence which can make our lives easier by maintaining all the data in proper nrm tool which also provides ipam support .

                              <span>About 5 years ago I set up a small network for a restaurant in the Caribbean. They wanted some IP cameras, a POS system and a slot machine server installed. I used an inexpensive Netgear router, an unmanaged POE switch and an LTE box for internet. All cabling was Cat 5e. A year later they wanted to add a guest network for the adjacent hotel. I set this up, but used a completely separate network infrastructure. I used ubiquity APs due to budget constraints. My thought at the time was by separating the two networks, it would keep the business network bandwidth more secure and wouldn’t bog down the cameras with the guest network traffic. 
 Currently the business is expanding, adding several more buildings to the property, creating a campus like environment. They want Internet and cameras on all these new buildings. Since I have these two separate networks, I’m starting to realize that it’s going to be much more expensive and redundant putting two sets of switches for every building. Also a couple of the buildings are across a road with very rocky soil. Max distance between buildings is about 110 feet. I want to know the best way to proceed with this project. I have a few questions:
 1) How are networks designed for say college campuses or hotels with several buildings when it comes to critical networks and simple Wi-Fi? Do they separate things?
 2) Is there any reason to keep the two networks separate in my case.
 3) What is the best way to segregate the network traffic, forming a more secure, prioritized network for the POS and camera, and a less secure network for guest WIFI?
 4) I want to use fiber to span the buildings, but If I am forced to use PTP wireless bridges (due to very rocky soil), can I use one PTP bridge to support 2 vlans?
 Thank you in advance for your help. As I am still a novice at this, problems like this are a great way to learn about this industry.

 test scenario:
 LAN 1: X0
 ZONE: LAN
 gateway: 172.16.30.1
 255.255.255.0

 Zone: LAN
 gateway: 172.16.40.1
 255.255.255.0

 host 2: 172.16.40.44
 both interfaces set to be trusted, and from what I understand that&#x27;s supposed to be enough to allow traffic to cross the LAN&#x27;s.
 But the devices can&#x27;t ping each other. I created a shared folder on host 1 (shared to everyone, blah blah blah, tested with successful intra-LAN access on a different LAN).

                              <span>Say you are looking at a WAN with a couple hundred routers and with a combination of MPLS and Internet links. And you had access to configs. Could read from a tftp server. And had snmp read only access to the WAN routers and switches behing them.
 How would you go about validating with offices had only one router versus which ones had two or more routers? What tool would look into subnets and subnet masks to determine what connects where? And would that tool identify Ethernet wAN interfaces and their connectivity?
 I know redundancy and diversity are different animals. What would correlate circuits from different vendors, or would you relay on ifdescr field?
 And how would you validate that traffic that normally goes over an MPLS circuit would take an alternate path in a failure?

 I would like to benefit of eSIM advantage to easily switch between operators accross differents country. RUTX50 or Microtik Chateau would be perfect if they was actually support that feature.
 Some advice ?

                              <span>Scenario: You have a switch/router/firewall deployed at LocationA but is being repurposed and needs to be moved to LocationB. The original packaging (box and foam inserts) have been disposed of.
 How do you appropriately move it?
 Things I&#x27;ve tried in the past:
  
Recycled other leftover boxes that have not been thrown away yet. Spare boxes are not always guaranteed to be available.
 Placed equipment in spare static bags. Static bags are easy to stock up. They provide protection from the elements. However, when stacking 2 or more devices in static bags they tend to slide around and are in danger of falling off the cart.
 Simply carry it under my arm or on a cart and walked down the street. This feels very wrong and unprofessional. My location gets a log of rainfall so this is not always feasible. Equipment is in danger of sliding off the cart or being dropped if I trip over a curb.
  
I know rule#1 is always use a company vehicle for insurance reasons, but what are the other rules you follow to ensure equipment is relocated safely?
 I&#x27;m considering something like this https://tripplite.eaton.com/4u-server-shipping-case~SRCASE4U to my boss since it seems like a good low-cost solution, but wanted to get other opinions.

                              <span>Does anyone have a suggestion for a network Copper/Fiber line tester? I was looking at the Netally linkrunner 10g professional kit. 
 I&#x27;ve been having a lot of cable issues recently and one of my network administrators constantly has to keep going on site to fix a time clock issue that only happens at the far end of a run in its intended location (Kitchen). The problem I have is that our Telecom team will not fix issues if we cannot show fault with cable which we are currently limited to physical inspection, troubleshooting by testing a variety of devices, or cable diagnostics on switch.
 I will include the situation I am currently facing just in case I am missing something:
 The mentioned time clock will work on the same port with a jumper cable with no failures.
 The time clock will work fine on other parts of the same site. (Lounge, Office, Etc.)
 The time clock will freeze at random intervals. (Mostly within 1 weeks time)
 Switch has same config as all other time clocks on site.
 I thank you all in advance for your time.

                              <span>Hi guys, we are moving to Extreme and going to be taking advantage of their fabric tech for our new multi campus network. We are coming from a stable and reasonably complicated network with IP routing to the access layer and separate VLANs and subnets on every switch for distinct devices types. 
 We are looking at ways we can build upon our existing design and stability but take advantage of features that fabric that mean we can change the design to suit each system. One thing that interests me is the possibility to move back to having L2 segments spanned across the entire estate and assigning a /24 subnet for a particular system such as CCTV. We can then give the service owner the /24 and tell them wherever they install their devices they will sit on the same subnet and if the system doesn&#x27;t work they can&#x27;t complain about devices not working over L3 when communicating with each other etc. 
 One of the problems with this approach is deciding where to put the gateways, what to push to the firewall or to keep on the core. We were looking at pushing critical devices gateway to our firewall for most control but also I am wondering about VRFs/segments and controlling traffic with routing rather than just spanning L2 to our firewall?
 Any advice or tips appreciated on how to best take advantage of fabric without making a mess. Cheers!

                              <span>Looking at the cisco IOSXE L2 STIG that calls out for UUFP to be enabled on all access ports with the command
 switchport block unicast 
 For our unused ports, we always put them in access mode, assign to a dead vlan, and then shutdown the port. 
 With that said, should the command still be applied to the unused port since it is an access port? The reason I ask if a lot of the findngs will say something like &quot;all user/host facing access ports&quot;, but this one specifically says &quot;all access ports&quot;.

 I have a cable modem I am trying to LAG (No, not that type) to a switch, since my router don&#x27;t support LACP on it. I have created a VLAN on the switch and router but need to map that vlan to the LAGed ports, and also one SFP port on either a Cisco or HP 3500yl switch. What would be the proper config for this?

                              <span>Hello! I would like your help in solving a networking homework to see if my idea is workable.
 Basic situation: given a company with a small site with several departments, the floor space itself is quite large, so several rack cabinets are placed due to the distance (100 m) between network and end device. The question is: what solution could be offered for this?
 My idea is to have several air-conditioned rooms where the rack cabinets are arranged, and where necessary because of the distance, e.g. between a computer and a switch in a rack cabinet, I would solve it with an optical cable, using a media converter.
 Would this work?

                              <span>Hi,
 I made a small dent in a 6a cable when attaching it to the wall. The dent was small (~3mm long, width like the cable itself, depth ~1mm) and the cable came back to it&#x27;s normal shape after few minutes but I&#x27;m still wondering if I should buy a new one - because I know it&#x27;s a fragile thing. Beside the dent, there was no other visible damage and I don&#x27;t have a way to test the cable - I can either keep it and pray it will work or buy a new one and try to replace it before we will finish the wall. I know it&#x27;s difficult/impossible to determine the damage by a description and a &quot;text drawing&quot; - I just hope to find someone who maybe had a similar experience and can share his/her expertise. For few minutes the cable looked like this:

                              <span>Hello ,
 We want to take everyone off SMS mfa and only have them with password less mfa that shows location and app. 
 The problem is that a lot of people are using legacy mfa from the o365 portal and have registered their cell phone as a auth method. 
 I would like to turn that off as a option as a registration method, but I am afraid if I go into the legacy mfa portal and turn off phone method , it will lock people out. So, I am afraid I will have to reach out to each user and ask them to registration their auth method as Microsoft authenticator before turning off legacy auth and moving over to the new Azure authentication gui.
 Is there an easier way , to go about this migration?
 If I turn off phone registration as a option in legacy mfa portal in o365 , is there a possibility it would only be forward facing for new users, and people who still have SMS auth will still be able to sign in to m365 services ?
 Again, we want the only option as a registration method to be passwordless mfa with Microsoft authenticator .

The next day I got an email from my boss unhappy with me saying there is a difference between a promotion and title change. THEN he emailed me a screenshot of &quot;promotion&quot; of the dictionary and highlighted it with yellow.............no raise, no &quot;official&quot; record of a change....from HR. What do I even do now?

                              <span>Started a new job a while ago and in addition to managing general IT needs we&#x27;re also responsible when it comes to handling, maintaining, and swapping a lot of low voltage devices such as door security panels, card readers, door contacts, door strikes, motion detectors, magnets, and so on. I&#x27;ve gotten by by reverse engineering most the stuff so far, but any issues with the loop and it&#x27;s over my head. 
 My problem, I know almost nothing when it comes to electricity. It&#x27;s black magic to me. I know AC &amp; DC exist, but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to explain the difference beyond &quot;hey, this is an AC wall outlet, and this is a battery powered device.&quot; Don&#x27;t know how to use a multi-meter. Not sure how loops work. Not sure what polarity &amp; reverse polarity is or how it works. Relays? Been hearing that a lot. I could point one out to you but couldn&#x27;t tell you what it does. Normally open? Normally closed? Both are normally over my head. Voltage? Wattage? Amperage? You get the point. 
 I pretty much just want some resource suggestions that can help me form a solid foundation from the ground up. Starting from the most basics of basic that you&#x27;d teach a kid to some of the more advanced stuff that&#x27;d I&#x27;d need to know if I decided to be an amateur low voltage tech.

Why waste the energy, if you did no one would understand ya. None of my friends actually understand what I do, relegating it as &#x27;black magic&#x27; or something like that. Talking to them is like talking to walls. Wife, yea, she might actually listen, but if she is she&#x27;s not taking it in. you can hear her eyes glaze over.
 It&#x27;s even like that at work. I mean at least no one cares what I do, I get left alone for the most part unless something takes too long. My boss understands, but you can&#x27;t vent to your boss.
 Your hobbies either need you to work, or you just don&#x27;t have the energy to do them any more.
 I dunno, I&#x27;m just tired.

When migrating to new hardware, they did everything for you, they actually insisted that they would do it. Version updates where the same, just let them know and they would remote in and take care of it. Best support I have ever had in decades. Well the company was recently sold to a corp in another country. First time trying to open a ticket since the sale, and since this was going to be a big migration, new version for all workstations, new server, OS and SQL versions as well we where hoping to get assistance with the migration. First, called the support number. Support line now says to go to a website to open all support tickets. Fine, go to …</span>

                              <span>Hey everybody. I am a one man show that’s supports 100+ users. I would like to find a better way to manage help tickets. I am tired of everyone mentioning their problems as I am passing them in the hall working on something else and then forgetting. What has worked for you? Is there a service that you would recommend? I am not looking for anything to robust just something to manage and keep a history of tickets. Thanks

 The worst part of being a sys admin, knowing your colleague will be fired before they do.
 Every time one of my coworkers, either in IT or not are about to be fired and I am made aware of it days in advance, it makes me nearly have a breakdown. We are a fairly small company, less than 200 people so I know everyone. On top of that, we are an even leaner IT team. Everyone but myself has a specialized role. I am a tweener that works between our SQL, Application and Infrastructure teams. I was made aware that my coworker who is the only other sysadmin in the company is being terminated over the next few days. I am sick to my stomach and the only saving grace is that my neck isn’t on the line. I am generally ok removing access once I get the word but I get in my own head leading up to it.
 How do you do it or am I just too soft?

                              <span>Why is microsoft support so bad? I know they outsource it to India but come on, at least vet them a little bit. 
 I submitted an issue about webcams to them over a month ago and they told me it was either my equipment or nothing on their end. Come to find today they have an advisory stating the exact thing I told them about a month ago. 
 They also always call when I put email support, it&#x27;s gotten to the point where my phone now reports it as Robocall / Spam.

                              <span>I’m a lvl 2 tech working under my boss who is the infrastructure manager. And we recently implemented a sharepoint site into our organization. The users have grown accustom to doing all their work via the file explorer and ever since the sharepoint migration they’ve been agitated that they have to navigate the sharepoint for their files, then download them so they can attach them to whatever application their working with whether it be word or outlook. We’ve created workarounds to alleviate the tediousness of this but I’m still baffled at my bosses approach. 
 When I ask why we can’t attach the SP to the file explorer my boss just says “it’s a security risk” without any explanation! I’ve tried looking this up but can’t seem to find any concrete explanation as to why it would be a security risk. Is this an SMB issue that I’m not aware of ? Any insight is appreciated. Thanks.

Journalists across Ecuador have been targeted by explosive devices sent through the post.
 One presenter, Lenin Artieda, was injured when he opened the envelope in the middle of the newsroom.
 He said the explosive device looked like a USB drive. He plugged it into his computer and it detonated.
  
Thats actually kinda scary. Not that its likely to happen to most people but still wow.

                              <span>I work on servers a fair bit as part of my job and I hate it whenever I have to remove a bunch of DIMMs as my fingers are sore for days afterwards. In the past 24 hours I&#x27;ve removed 384 DIMMs from a few servers (Had to shuffle some hardware around to get the desired configurations for a project). Do there exists things you can put on your fingers (finger condoms?) or even some sort of tool that can make this task less painful? Thanks!

 NOTE: This requires various admin rights (obviously) and O365 subscriptions that I&#x27;m honestly not sure of offhand. I&#x27;ve only tested it in my org, which is Exchange Online, no on-prem servers. I&#x27;m not responsible if you nuke your entire org&#x27;s email.

Currently the filter points to the 2 internal DNS servers. But we&#x27;re getting some weird website issues occasionally where a site just don&#x27;t pull up on one PC, but on another it will, and we have troubleshooted from the PC level out to the Internet and the only thing in-line is this Web Filter.
 Should I point the web filters DNS to use something external like Google DNS? Or Google for #1 and inside for #2?

 Script runs fine, and the wifi profile is added. However you cannot join it. Wifi is not listed in available networks (even though it is available). 
 if you add the network manually (Hidden Network &gt; same ssid &gt; same password as the xml) it says unable to connect. 
 You must first go to known networks and forget the network that was added by the script and add it again manually for it to work.

                              <span>Now i can understand us doing something wrong, i have found one of our most frequent offenders was plugged in to the surge only port on the battery back up.
 for those not privy with Dell dock issues, it seems the docks get out of sync and think the laptop is off when it is in fact ON. so you get &quot;No Signal&quot; on your screens.
 easy enough unplug, shut down, close lid, plug in and from dock power on. boom they are in sync and all is working well, until next Tuesday when it happens again. I get parts of Missouri have shite infrastructure, maybe we have power blips but, they are all on UPS. 
 Even if they weren&#x27;t the firmware should be smart enough to figure out it&#x27;s out of sync.
 I ran through Dells support and they suggested RMA and asked if they meant all 72 docks, they said yes. I told them need one heel of a truck and pallet, they assured me they have an RMA team for this.
 Talk about wasting their own money! (I asked for an escalation)

 Every time a user logs in to the VPN it triggers this event with ID 5838: The Netlogon service encountered a client using RPC signing instead of RPC sealing.
 Microsoft article about this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5021130-how-to-manage-the-netlogon-protocol-changes-related-to-cve-2022-38023-46ea3067-3989-4d40-963c-680fd9e8ee25
 Ivanti is releasing a new firmware but it&#x27;s probably not going to be released on time.
 From their website: https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Netlogon-Protocol-Changes?language&#x3D;en_US
 &quot; Ivanti Dev team has made changes in the code and fix will be available in ICS&#x27;s firmware releases tentative for April 2023.
 Workaround: To workaround this issue, we need to set the below registry value to &quot;1&quot; for compatibility mode on domain controller, until Ivanti releases the fixed version of this:
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters&quot;

 I have 4 accounts that need to be migrated from GoDaddy’s 365 to a normal Microsoft 365 account. 
 3 of these accounts will be converted to shared inboxes, because the client was using generic accounts like “service” or “scheduling” that multiple users would log into. 1 of these accounts is for the owner.
 I’ve seen the bittitan and migrationwiz ways to migrate, but I am wondering if I could just simply backup the mailboxes to a pst from GoDaddy since there are only 4 of them, and just upload the pst to the new Microsoft accounts I’ve created and licensed. 
 Once I do this, can I delete the 365 plan from GoDaddy, and then the tenant would automatically be released so I can change the mx records to point at the new Microsoft account, or would I have to contact Godaddy to release them?
 If they have onedrive documents, I am assuming I would also have to backup those. 
 TLDR: I am just wondering if there is an easier way to do the GoDaddy 365 to Microsoft 365 migration if I only have 4 user accounts, and 3 of those will be converted to shared mailboxes.

                              <span>Hello all, and thanks to everyone that helps with solutions to our madness of IT issues. I was wondering if any of you have a tip/trick to find &#x27;rogue&#x27; (non-managed) switches on a network. I work for a small school district of about 10 schools and we are in the process of refreshing our switches. Out with the Brocade and in with Aruba. We know that we have non managed switches in some sites, but were wondering how we could locate others that may have been put in. Thank you all in advance for your responses

                              <span>For Context: We have a Wi-Fi network called CBNet that is set to auto-connect to Chromebooks under our domain, and it is a hidden network.
 ​
 We have two Dell 3100 Chromebooks and one Dell 3100 2 in 1 Chromebook that we sent out to a company called &quot;ITurity&quot; for repair. The company swapped the motherboard in all the Chromebooks with another. To get the motherboard to sync with the Chromebook, they entered Dev Mode and switched the serial number to match the original Chromebook.
 When we got them back, it prompted us to re-enroll them, so we did. Now, the Chromebooks all have the same issue. When using wireless, it does not auto connect like it is supposed to. You can manually enter the CBNet Wi-Fi and password and use the Chromebook, but once you power off an on again, it doesn&#x27;t auto-connect (although you can still click on the network and connect because the SSID and password are saved.
 We called the company, and they said that it is not an issue they&#x27;ve had, and they bought their motherboards from different manufacturers for the 3100 and 3100 2 in 1. We have tried an OS recovery, but we can&#x27;t powerwash because we had it disabled in the Admin Console (it still appears to be disabled). We also can&#x27;t powerwash through the console. It shows the last activity on the Chromebooks as months ago. When connected to the network with an ethernet to USB adapter, you can login to the Chromebook and use it.
 We have tried manually connecting to other Wi-Fi&#x27;s, and that works the same as with CBNet. The only difference is that when connecting to the CBNet network, there is an exclamation point to the bottom right of the Wi-Fi symbol.
 ​
 Any help would be appreciated!!

 Long time lurker. Basically I&#x27;ve got a new job lined up mid April. Significant pay increase, title , etc.
 Currently my contract with current company is coming to an end on the 31st with an expectation of signing the renewal contract. 
 My question is ; I&#x27;m getting paid this week. Should I work that final week or should I officially resign this week and get a longer time off before the new role?

What would you do if you took a problem you are having with a manager or coworker to an objective third party (outside hr) whose job it is to specifically deal with these. That manager finds out and isn&#x27;t happy and now makes you feel like your job is in danger. I can explain in more detail privately if needed.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been a contractor to the Fed&#x27;l government since 1992. I have a ton of experience dealing with all sorts of hardware, software, peripherals, etc. With the contracting world there comes times when you must job hop for one reason or another. Mostly I only hop when my contract is coming to an end and the current company hasn&#x27;t been able to place me on another contract. So that means that I have to interview all over again, which I don&#x27;t mind. The part that I do mind is having some cocky kid ask the most asininely questions to me during an interview about my skills or background. I&#x27;m not sure whether they are meaning to be asses to show their worth to their boss and use me as their example or if they genuinely do not know how to do an interview. For example, only a few years ago I had this guy ask me what I would do if a user reported they were having an issue while printing. Seriously??? A freaking printer problem?? That&#x27;s Tier 1, at best, and I&#x27;m Tier 2/3 my entire career since about 1995 and this guy asks me about a printer issue and how I would resolve it?
 So, what&#x27;s the most assinine thing you&#x27;ve been asked during an interview as part of your experience?

                              <span>Currently, I&#x27;m experiencing professional apathy in my life. Nothing seems interesting to me in my professional life, and I&#x27;m worried that I should leave my job and try something else.
 I&#x27;ve spent over 10 years in IT as a software developer but still feel like a mid-level developer who is quite far from being a professional senior software developer. To be honest, I don&#x27;t see any motivation to grow because, in every company I&#x27;ve worked for, I&#x27;ve encountered demotivating things like not paying attention to legacy code, lack of clean code practices, teammates with high ego but low empathy, a lot of talks but lack of documentation and self-explanatory code, etc. For me, this is not about software development but more about corporate processes where I don&#x27;t see a good place for myself.

 I’m convinced that years ago you could configure an APC UPS not to provide power to connected devices until the batteries had recharged to a certain percentage, thus preventing pc/server power on and shutting down straight away if the mains power went off again within minutes. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>This question is tricky, when I first looked at controlling 365 through GPO I learned if you have MS 365 Business Standard licensing then you cannot control any of your Office products with a GPO, its only the E3 and better licensing that MS allows you to use GPO&#x27;s with. 
 I have come across this page:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/teams-install#use-group-policy-to-control-the-installation-of-microsoft-teams 
 But I cannot use it because its for 365 apps only, which again from what I have been and what I read months ago it won&#x27;t work with Business Standard. 
 Does anyone have a better solution to getting Teams from auto-starting other than uninstalling it? 
 Thanks,

                              <span>Due to a cyber attack and for various other reasons I&#x27;ve had to &quot;temporarily&quot; migrate to IT/Sysadmin for the past few months at my org. (We&#x27;re a tech org but my &quot;day job&quot; wasn&#x27;t directly in the IT department).
 This past week end users have started to have to get more involved with me/us and I don&#x27;t know how you all do it. I&#x27;m literally loosing the will to live.
 &quot;It still doesn&#x27;t work&quot; was my latest report. REALLY?! REALLY?! HOW GOD DAMN USELESS IS THAT.
 Why doesn&#x27;t it work? What&#x27;s not working about it? What&#x27;s the error? What should be happening?
 Why is it so hard for end users to be useful.....
 I need no help or advice, I just needed to vent for a minute.

                              <span>I am trying to understand something. My company is trying to migrate an on-premise ERP (Sage 300) to the cloud. We were advised by Sage&#x27;s business partner in my country to set up a cloud instance with 16 GB of RAM, 4CPUs and 120GB SSD storage which we did. However, we logged in four simultaneous users and it seemed to be a bit sluggish. Given that during normal business operations, we&#x27;ll have more than 10 simultaneous users logged in, this didn&#x27;t seem like a good fit. Now, the confusion is this, the business partner had asked for a lot of money to set the server up. They say that there is a way you set up the server so that it becomes faster, he even mentioned that he has a server with the same specs handling more than 18 simultaneous users logged and working seemlessly. The question is, what is this &quot;way&quot; they are talking about? From my understanding the steps of setting up a server are pretty standard, I mean, chose the package (In my case AWS Lightsail) and then launch it. Are there any tips and tricks I am missing? A new installation I believe doesn&#x27;t come with heavy and buggy software that would slow down the server. Oh, the operating system in question is Windows Server 2016.

 So last Friday, after the last straw was put in this camel&#x27;s back, I gave my notice. I did so because I have become so burned out that I&#x27;m a massive cynical ass.
 I won&#x27;t go into details as to why I have end-up so burned out but let&#x27;s just summarize it as being underpaid and underappreciated. I have end-up having a toxic relationship with work of &quot;let us see who takes the piss more out of the other&quot;. I have been working for 28K a year and have been asked heaven and earth for it. I gave it my all for over a year before I began to give up and stayed to build a CV as this was my first fully fledged Sys Admin job, I have been here for 3 years in total. In my previous place, I was paid 22k a year for a semi-Sysadmin job where I implemented some stuff that saved the company thousands and t…</span>

                              <span>A few days ago one of our APC broke down, and I ordered a replacement. In the meantime, half of the physical infrastructure is directly plugged into the wall, which is not ideal.
 We are running a 3 nodes VMware infrastructure with 2 SANs and one of the impacted devices that was previously plugged into the failing APC is a core switch that is dedicated to storage, so basically directly plugged to both SANs and 3 nodes. The switch itself is member of a stack, but with only two members (one commander and one standby) which means both switches are actually active, so I cannot simply unplug it or it might cause outages and it&#x27;s especially dangerous with the storage for our VMs. 
 My question is : what would be your approach to unplug that switch with minimal impact for the end user ? Is there a way from vCenter to pause the infrastructure easily, and resume, and will that be enough to safely unplug the switch ? 
 I don&#x27;t have much knowledge and I&#x27;m the sole IT for a medium size company, and I have no experience dealing with this. 
 Pausing the infrastructure is acceptable for a short timespan but I want to make sure that I am doing everything that is needed to ensure that no Vm integrity is at risk.

 Imagine, you have many clients with same needs in Azure. Let&#x27;s have an example: deploy Bitlocker using Intune. You have to It takes many steps in Portal to do (you click here, there, then choose something in dropdown etc etc), so we have automation options, such as to use Az module in PowerShell, but this is tricky to script-as-you-follow-UI.
 What are Your first steps or wireframe practice when You get instructions in user interface that needs to be automated in Azure Portal? What you do first, what next? Use MS-Graph API?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m confused to what dictates the forest functional level.
 We have a lot of servers in our estate (100+), where there still a couple of 2008 R2 VMs kicking about, that we are in the progress of decommissioning and moving onto 2022. I&#x27;ve recently inherited the setup here so trying to get all sorted and all up to 2019 / 2022.
 Our domain functional level is 2012 R2 as we still have 1 2012 R2 DC that&#x27;s due to be replaced with 2022 in the coming months, but I&#x27;ve noticed our forest level is showing 2008 R2. I decommissioned a 2008 R2 DC yesterday, and increased the functional level to 2012 R2. Is that because of the 2008 R2 servers kicking about still or is it likely still updating in the background?

 I activated it by using the slmgr /ipk XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX command. It prompts me that the key is installed successfully, but I&#x27;m still met with this error. There is also a &#x27;Activate windows&#x27; watermark present.
 Any ideas? I&#x27;m using the same license key that the host uses.

                              <span>Hello, We&#x27;re having a strange issue where we can&#x27;t use RDS on any of our servers except for the RD Connection Broker itself. We get the following error:
 The Server pool does not match the RD Connection Brokers that are in it. Errors:
  
Cannot connect to any of the specified RD Connection Broker Servers. Ensure that at least one server is available and that the Remote Destop Management (rdms), RD Connection Broker (tssdis), or RemoteAPP and Desktop Connection (tscpubrpc) services are running.
 ServerName.Domain.Local
  
I have tried logging into the RDS database, and took it offline and back online - this made no change. I&#x27;ve tried using Server Manager on other servers and connecting to the RDS broker but I get the same issue. It seems to be a problem with the RDS Broker server allowing connections from other servers. Does anyone have any ideas?

 The Technical Element
 Design for change
 - The old google mantra is right. Design for change. Change is having to deploy new software, upgrade existing software, scaling, equipment breaking, and people shifting around.
 - Everything in this mantra is about finding balance. You might think it&#x27;s a good idea to tightly marry your system to a particular OS or Linux distro. It&#x27;s just as bad of an idea to separately them entirely. Use layers and a _little_ indirection if you must.
 - This does not mean complete and total platform agnostics. It&#x27;s about making one system two, two systems twenty. Dealing if a sysadmin gets hit by a bus, if that dangling harddrive dies, if someone runs rm -rf /. It&#x27;s for the incremental changes. Security update…</span>

                              <span>We implemented EAP-TLS certificate-based authentication for WiFi after 22H2 and for the most part it works fine. The only time it ever comes unstuck is when a user logs into a laptop for the first time (such as for a pool laptop) on WiFi. 
 The device is authenticated to WiFi using its own device certificate, but once the user logs in, authentication is handed over to the user. Since the user has never logged in, they haven&#x27;t requested a certificate from the CA, so it therefor can&#x27;t connect. 
 The only way around this is for them to login for the first time while connected to ethernet, and do a &quot;gpupdate /target:user /force&quot; which carries out the user&#x27;s CSR and certificate issue process. Not ideal. 
 Anyone got an idea on how to work around this, besides stopping user-handoff all together?

                              <span>Good Morning,
 I’m working on syncing Teams documents to devices via OneDrive for business, allowing end users to be able to access the files within File Explorer on Windows 10.
 I’m having some issues with file path lengths and hoping someone could steer me in the right direction.
 In article 1 is says &quot;SharePoint Online and OneDrive have a 256-character limit on Windows PCs. If you exceed the character limit, you receive an error message when you try to do anything within the synchronized document libraries, like creating folders or renaming documents.&quot;
 However, in article 2 it says it can be up to 520. Is anyone able to advise on what the source of truth is please? Additional information at the bottom if you have questions.
 Article 1 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide
 Article 2 - https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa
 Why am I doing this? – The organisation name is really long and it significantly cutting into the file character limit count
 Have you tested this? – Yes I have and I’m getting stuck at 256/260 characters. However, this could be down to the ‘long file paths’ setting, which I am struggling to get working. I don’t want to further troubleshoot the ‘long file paths’ not working correctly if it’s not going to be supported in the first place.
 Kind Regards,
 Max

 I had a job where I had everything under control. the only one who was able to manage customer servers and I had it all going well, with monitoring and everything so I was not very busy, since I automated everything and basically, I was testing my new skills right there, improving stuff as I learned (I dockerized most of the stuff once I get familiar with docker, I setup reverse proxies to manage certs where we did all of that manually etc) - not a difficult stuff.

                              <span>I&#x27;m investigating a forged email that a user recently received. The email was one of those typical ones where the actor reaches out to say they have an urgent task for an employee. The FROM email address is the real email address of the manager though and there is not a alternate &quot;Return Address&quot; header so a reply would go directly to the manager. (The manager&#x27;s account has been checked and is definitely not compromised).
 From the headers I can see that the email originated from a goDaddy server and that the SPF check passed on that basis. My gut feeling here is that someone is &quot;playing&quot; with one of goDaddy&#x27; servers here which is why there is no &quot;Return Address&quot; set. At the end of the day, the attack is toothless because any reply to the email would have gone to an uncompromised internal …</span>

                              <span>So long story short, I&#x27;m not an online exchange admin, but I have a fair amount of experience in most fields. I&#x27;m in cybersecurity, and the exchange admins ran the script to create the application and set me up so I can run the script any time that I would like.
 The issue is that the script is too slow to work on an environment of our scale. We have 37k mailboxes and receive almost a million emails each day.
 At two minutes a mailbox, the time to process would be 50 days.
 They provide removing throttling for OnPrim and completely ignore Online. Has anyone used this script to process a large environment?
 I&#x27;ve tried things like grabbing the mailbox statistics and ignoring any that haven&#x27;t been active recently, but that&#x27;s still in the tens of thousands.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Just got hired at a startup as the first in-house IT hire. The company previously worked with a contractor who worked after hours, and needless to say, didn’t put much effort into doing things the right way here…he never had anyone to check his work! Anyways, the company has been using Google Drive as their corporate file system for its first couple of years and I’ve been tasked with cleaning it up and setting it up as a traditional file system used in corporate environments…
 So just wanted to see how other companies are using Google Drive and how other sys admins are setting it up? For context, there are hundreds of thousands of existing files, permissions are a mess, and no department is open to restructuring lol. What’s the best way to rip off the band-aid here and use it as efficiently as possible?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello experts, I am experienced an abnormal symptom on my Huawei module.
 Hardware Spec: NE8000 M8
 Modul Spec: TR-FF13L-N00 50gb/s 1311 LC10KM(SMF) (Range RX -8.9dbm, 4.1dbm Range TX -4.5dbm, 4.1dbm)
 We tested patch cord, tested our dark fiber with OTDR, everything is ok. I was wondering because the signal is not stable It ranged from -4.8 to -6.7 and it changed every 5 mins.
 What is the caused of it? or it&#x27;s normal?

                              <span>We need to setup a VPN with jitter, delay, and packet loss to ease testing of poor network conditions across our studio. Something easy for developers to connect to and then test with across a range of devices. There exists some simple solutions we can setup and host ourselves, but there is a paid VPN that offers this type of service already that is a pay and play solution? I have not been able to find one as they seem to focus on reliability.

                              <span>I&#x27;m the network engineer at an organisation with around 130 branch sites spread across New Zealand and overall around 4000 users.
 We have Meraki SD-WAN, switching and wireless at the moment. We are backhauling all traffic from branch sites back to a Meraki VPN concentrator in our DC and breaking out to the internet via Fortigate firewalls. We are in the process of migrating most of our on-premises server infrastructure and services to public cloud and eventually there may not be a need for an on-prem DC firewall.
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with coming up with a plan to locally breakout traffic at branch sites. Personally, the UTM/NGFW capabilities on the Meraki&#x27;s are rubbish and nowhere near Enterprise grade compared to what we have with Fortigates. The logging and overall visibility is extremely limited compared to FortiAnalyzer as well.
 I&#x27;ve started looking into SASE solutions. The easiest to integrate with our existing Meraki kit is Cisco Umbrella. However, Cisco does not have an Umbrella PoP here in New Zealand so I would be forced to tunnel all traffic to Australia (Sydney or Melbourne) which is a dealbreaker. From past experiences and aside from concerns with reliability, this would not work for us with websites getting geo IP redirected to Australian sites, sensitive sites such as banking, etc.
 I&#x27;m interested to know your experiences with any of the below which I&#x27;ve identified as having a local PoP here in New Zealand.
 Zscaler
 Palo Alto Prisma
 Cloudflare
 Cato Networks
 Netskope
 It&#x27;s a bit hard as you can imagine to read past the marketing fluff and gimmicks to know how these products truly perform.

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 My mother is opening a restaurant and needs some help with setting up a network for the business. I&#x27;m an IT professional with a focus on Azure/AWS security &amp; compliance. While I have some networking experience in my homelab, I&#x27;m seeking some guidance because of some key constraints that I have to navigate.
 Here are the requirements:
  
One subnet for a POS system called Toast. This subnet is highly managed by the vendor. No &quot;unauthorized devices&quot; can be connected to this subnet. The vendor provides a Meraki Z3 router and an unmanaged switch. Downstream from those, there&#x27;ll be two receipt printers, three POS kiosks, and a cash drawer. Endpoints on this subnet will be hardwired. No wireless.
 One subnet for all non-POS equipment. For this, I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a Meraki Go Router Firewall and a Meraki Go Access Point. Endpoints on this network will all be wireless. No hardwired. 
  
We&#x27;ll have five static IP addresses available. The kicker is that Toast POS explicitly forbids the presence of an intermediate device between the ISP&#x27;s gateway and their router. Normally, I&#x27;d put a router firewall in front of the Toast POS router and isolate it on its own VLAN. Since I can&#x27;t do that, I&#x27;m not quite sure how to create two subnets while meeting the POS requirements. Is it possible to connect both routers directly to the gateway, assign a static IP to each, and isolate the traffic on the gateway? I suppose that will depend on the capabilities of the gateway device. Comcast hasn&#x27;t told me what unit we&#x27;ll be getting yet. 
 Just looking for some guidance here. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been struggling recently on making up a (what should be) simple network topology. Link is here: https://imgur.com/a/unD88qC
 For background: 1. I want PC 1, 2, and 4 to be able to talk to each other 2. All PCs within their own boundary should be able to talk to the other PCs within that boundary only (with the exception of above)
  
I can not modify the IP addresses already assigned (everything is on a 192.168.1.0/24). I can change the gateways.
 
I can not modify the switch attached to 1.50 and 1.75, assume its an out-of-box L2 switch
 
 I&#x27;d like to use ACLs to complete this by controlling the outgoing traffic from each layer 3 switch. (i.e Fa0/4 with an out ACL to stop PC5 from reaching outside its boundary).
 To my understanding one (of many) would look like (middle switch):
 interface FastEthernet0/10
 ip access-group TO_NORTH out
 !
 ...
 ip access-list extended TO_NORTH
 permit ip host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.1.50
 permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.1.50
 !
 I recognize there&#x27;s an implicit deny at the bottom, that should cover anything not listed from &quot;leaving&quot; the &quot;boundary&quot;. After I apply this ACL to the port, for some reason all traffic no matter the source or destination still passes through that switch, port, and ACL as if it was never applied.
 ​
 I think i&#x27;ve dug my mind into a rabbit&#x27;s hole and have confused myself over what I believe should be rather easy. Do I need to have routing enabled or GW set somewhere specific? 
 if there&#x27;s any more info i can provide, lmk
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey there,
 I have a NetBox server with 2 CPUs and 8GB of RAM. It also runs a webhook handler specific to NetBox. These webhooks will make basic changes via Ansible, like update a port description or change a port&#x27;s mode based on updates to interfaces. However, there have been times where I&#x27;ve tried to update 10+ interfaces at a time, which will then cause the webhook handler to take on 10 webhooks/execute 10 scripts at the same time. This seems to spike CPU usage for varying amounts of time, depending on the number of interfaces I attempted to update. The spike causes the VM console to freeze up and often causes some of the webhooks to not execute properly.
 I&#x27;m just curious if anyone else is using their NetBox server as a webhook handler, and if so, what specs it&#x27;s deployed with to get it to work smoothly. I made a post in r/Netbox, but figured I&#x27;d add it here as well for exposure.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 My company has recently gotten a Cisco C1101 Integrated Services Router to sub-divide our currently flat network. I have used routers before I have used switches before but not an “L3 Switch” as this is known as. Interface g0/0/0 is the L3 “WAN” and g0/1/0~3 are L2 “LAN” ports. I literally just want this to act as a router between the company firewall and our domain controller but I can’t for the life of me get it sorted. What I’ve done so far is create two VLANs that are assigned to two ports each example VLAN 20 is on g0/1/0-1 , VLAN 30 is on g0/1/2-3 This is only a 4port switch plus the WAN port. I assume I need to do PAT on the device but am struggling. Any advice at all is much appreciated, I will answer whatever questions you got for me to the best of my ability. Thank you.

                              <span>Hi, 
 does anyone know what command can I use to turn off DHCP server on H3C MSR 930. 
 When I enter, &quot;display current config&quot; command I Can see that DHCP is enabled on a router, but by using &quot;?&quot; sign I cannot find a command in a system view mode, default mode or by entering interface mode that would allow me to turn off DHCP.
 I need to do this ASAP or I may lose my job.

 I have HP c7000 chassis with 6125XLG blade switches. Can i create LACP bundle active-active on each blade servers using IRF? 
 Majority of documents only saying you can have multiple HP switches in daisy chain system to easy management but none explains about real use case.

 I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible under Site-To-Site VPN to add a new &quot;Local Networks&quot; with this one host address and &quot;Disable&quot; VPN Mode. Would that solve the issue?
 I&#x27;ve been at this for a few days. New to Meraki and not sure what the best solution is.

                              <span>Over the last several years, cloud computing growth has been significant. The cost of cloud computing is also increasing especially now that AI is going mainstream.
 Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve read some people saying that companies are starting to think about moving back to on-premises for company servers to reduce cost.
 Is this actually starting to happen in a big way? Does this mean that there might be increasing demand for people that understand infrastructure and networking again because cloud infrastructure is getting too expensive?

 What tool do you use to schedule maintenances and find (indirectly) affected services?
 Customers directly connected to a network element or a specific region are easy to filter, but we also have a lot of P2P connections, these can also be indirectly affected when intermediate elements are undergoing maintenance.
 These fall into two categories:
 a) indirectly affected, but re-routing possible
 b) indirectly affected, but no alternative paths available
 Thanks for your suggestions!

                              <span>Hey all,
 Just looking for some advise/anecdotes on what others have done. We are getting ready to open a new office and I&#x27;ve got some gear that the office will need. List includes:
  
Meraki Switches
 Meraki Firewalls
 UPS system
 Rack Mount PDUs
  
My preference is for a 4 post rack system but this office only comes with a Chatsworth 22Y9, which is a 2 post system. I haven&#x27;t typically had to buy this equipment in the past as datacenters I&#x27;ve hosted gear in already come with 4 post rack systems and such. Is it possible/recommended to simply get a 2nd 2post rack and do a make shift 4 post system? Or should I just make a play and ask management to scrap the existing 22Y9 and spring for a 4 post rack?

                              <span>I&#x27;m mainly only talking about EVPN here, I think flood and learn multicast is easier to understand.
 As an optimization for pure Data-Plane flood-and-learn process (multicast), BGP was extended so VTEPs could learn MAC addresses from BGP advertisements. This reduces the amount of multicast traffic caused by unknown unicast: once an end-host boots up and sends any packet, like ARP for the default gateway, that host’s MAC is learned and advertised into BGP so every VTEP will learn it and populate their forwarding table.
 Once a packet hits the VLAN access interface of a VNI, it&#x27;ll check what VRF its apart of, if it&#x27;ll use either the L2 or L3 VNI as the VXLAN ID depending on if the remote device is on the same VNI or another. The VTEP will either know to send the packet across to the other VT…</span>

                              <span>So PoE extension might not even be the best option here for me, and if it isn&#x27;t you all have a better idea please feel free to recommend it. As it stands: I have a client that has a 1 Gigabit wireless bridge between two buildings. I have to move one of the Bridges in order to get it to line-of-site. Going up is not an option. I know you can buy Active PoE Extenders and daisy chain them together to get up to 1000 feet of ethernet (which is more than enough for what I need). 
 I am looking to extend the ethernet around 850 feet. What I&#x27;m confused on is Active vs. Passive. I was going to use an Active PoE Switch to power the ethernet extenders (I would need two). My issue is: the Bridge is Passive PoE (24v). I know Active 802.3-latest is &quot;smart&quot; and won&#x27;t push power to the Bridge, but I am wondering what to do from here. Do I get a Passive PoE Splitter? Do I need to get one that is specifically 24v? 
 I am familiar enough with the 802.3af, 802.3at etc but I really need help understanding what to do at this point. And like I said, would I be better served to do something like an Ethernet to Fiber setup? I know I can get over 1000 feet from a setup like that.
 I&#x27;m just wondering what you all have in mind. I would really appreciate the help.

 ​
 I have 6 switch with SFP connection that I need to connect to an aggregate switch in my datacenter. I found a few device like Ubiquiti aggregate usw but i hate the fact you need to have OS console to run it, Cisco SG350 that look not bad and a TPlink enterprise. All those device got SFP. The company got 150 employes. What device among those your recommend or any other suggestion. The internet speed also will be 1GB

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into BT Ethernet Services for wholesale ethernet.
 I&#x27;m confused at how it is handed over to the CP. My understanding is that it is a &#x27;wires only&#x27; layer 2 service. Would I be correct in saying that means there are no IP addresses involved?
 What does a CP need to do on their side to accommodate BT Ethernet Services? Do you just need a switch?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about what plans people have in place (if any) for when the brown stuff happens.
 We have 2 core switches, in different physically separate buildings, each access switch links back to both.
 We have 2 firewalls, one in each building, 2 and ISP connections feeding both firewalls. Each of the buildings also has its own wan switches and wan routers.
 We back up EVERYTHING at our Primary DC which is located in our head office and to a DR site in a collocated data center about 3 miles away, we back up at least once a day (some systems backup hourly) using Veeam.
 We have a contingency plan for servers and systems if something kills primary sites. Realistically unless there&#x27;s a power failure or some kind of apocalyptic event. Think worst-case, think the building Data Centre has been fired and both redundant cores are down.
 For the sake of discussion, let&#x27;s assume you still have your off-site backups and application in the DR site, and both redundant core switch fails at the primary site. In that case, Servers and workstations lose connectivity to the network.
 How would you route end users to connect to the DR site?
 Has anyone actually dealt with such a scenario; how did it go? If not, what plan do you have or what is the suggestion?

                              <span>I&#x27;m designing a network for my workplace. I&#x27;m pretty under qualified but I am what we have.
 We have a number of WAN links that will likely change, each requires a subnet. I know the number of links will be between 3 and 8 but don&#x27;t know exactly how many we will have. At the same time I want to be efficient with our public address space.
 Is there a best practice for planning subnetting like this? One of our providers wants to know the IP address for an eBGP peering session but I don&#x27;t want to commit with subnet info until I am sure.

                              <span>From my understanding, it was invented for servers. When I look online nornir is faster and more flexible, but requires learning python.
 If we&#x27;re getting into network automation shouldn&#x27;t we be learning python anyways and want more flexibility?
 I keep reading ansible can be a nightmare with an update, etc. For those who rely on it heavily. 
 Let&#x27;s discuss and debate as network professionals.

 The hardware in questions is;
 Site A: USG PRO-4 Site B: Datto DNA device
 Datto user interface shows the tunnel as active and connected properly.
 I am able to ping each gateway from each site however I am not able to connect to any local network equipment.
 Site A subnet is 192.168.1.0/24 Site B subnet is 10.0.1.0/24

 Any suggestions on where to go from here? I figured enabling StS VPN topology would automatically open the necessary ports but maybe I’m wrong here and missing a rule?
 Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hey all! 
 So I will be moving to the US with my wife (Nurse) and would like to get some insights on the job landscape in the Chicago area. I currently work remotely for an MSP and we do lot of Microsoft 365 work, Azure, SharePoint etc with some moderate on-prem sysadmin work (Microsoft environments). Been in IT for over 9 years. Current company 4 years. Most likely I will be able to keep my job while in the US but planning to switch down the road. Current pay is in the 50K range.
 How difficult is it to land a decent IT job? What is the pay range in the area? No college degree, but hold bunch of MS Certs and experience. 
 Appreciate in advance for your input.

                              <span>So i am a security admin and we are attempting to improve our security score with defender. Upon further investigation i noticed that there are some machines that are duplicated within the defender portal. From what i saw there wasn&#x27;t a way to remove any of the machines so what i am going to do tomorrow is contact Microsoft to see if there is a way to go about this but my curiousity is really pegging me on this and i was wondering if anyone would be able to tell me if there is a way to remove them or if microsoft is able to do it on their own if i gave them the information to do it. If there is anything that you didnt understand on this i need to explain further let me know

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 Environment is Office 365 E3. No third-party email filtering.
 In the past week I have been receiving a lot of false positive SPAM emails. Internal emails and Microsoft emails are ending up as SPAM and going to junk. Customer emails as well. We also noticed we cannot invite more than 10 customers to meeting.
 It is even impacting systems where we allow spoofing and impersonation such as our SAP system. Those are also going to Junk.
 I have a Premier Support ticket opened, but so far it is not resolved.
 My though is Microsoft turned up their filtering in response to Outlook zero-day (CVE-2023-23397).
 Has anyone else noticed this recent uptick in false positives?

                              <span>The company I work for recently bought out another company and with that, the small IT team that the company had, left after a proper turn over of their IT infrastructure. The issue is that they did not seem to have an MDM for the smartphones they issued and we can&#x27;t seem to find if they had passcodes or anything saved.
 My question is, is it possible to reach out to the Carrier or manufacture of the phones to have them unlocked? Right now, we have a box with more on the way and it seems they are all just fancy paper weights.

These are getting caught by our anti-phish/anti-spam filters, but how are they getting new hire information so quickly? 
 I have a theory that it could be related to HR in some way or another. We use BambooHR to supplement our HR department. Any advice or similar experiences? Guessing it&#x27;s going to be a phone call to our BambooHR provider.

                              <span>Not sure if this fits here, but it&#x27;s a thing that happens mainly at work so ehh, mods can decide.
 Basically I&#x27;m wondering how you guys manage forgetting things. I&#x27;m a desktop guy at a small org, doing everything from help desk to server work. Intune management, laptop, phone setup, on off boarding, printer management, paper refilling, swipe card setup, desk relocations, visitor queries, water cooler repairs, the whole shebang.
 I have real problems with getting busy and forgetting what I was doing and I&#x27;m wondering how to manage this.
 I had a user ask me to do something, and between walking from one end of the office back to my desk and sitting down, I&#x27;d forgotten what it was was sitting down to do and proceeded to instead do the other two things I got asked about on the way. Sometimes I&#x27;ll read an email and go to action it then forget what I was doing halfway through, or answer a question and then forget about the email completely. 
 It&#x27;s this kind of forgetfulness that keeps getting me in trouble with the boss. How do you guys manage this when you run into it? I have rules on my inbox to flag emails as they come in now, as well as a task planner in teams, but I still keep running into these issues whenever I get busy.
 I&#x27;ve mentioned it to my boss before, but short of moving to paid overtime to clear my to do list I&#x27;m not sure what I can do. I&#x27;m one of the lowest salaried staff at my org from what I understand, but I can&#x27;t move jobs because I otherwise like my job and can&#x27;t do things like that in my life (if someone had a gun to my head and told me to move jobs or stand up for myself I&#x27;d just take the bullet)
 Anyway input on how to not forget things would be great.

 ​
  
Share the metadata file for the new Identity Provider with the Product Support team by submitting a SSO Setup Request.
 Test the new connection with an SP initiated link, provided by Box Product Support.
 This link is NOT exposed to end users. Only users with this link can log in using the new Identity Provider; all other users will continue to log in as normal.
 Work with a user that has credentials for the new Identity Provider has been given access to Box within the Identity Provider. Have them log into Box by clicking the provided link.
 Report back to your Product Support contact about the success of this test.
  
What in the hell is this SSO workflow? Am I being trolled? I really can&#x27;t configure my own SSO settings?

                              <span>I am going through CCNA Training and have hit a spot that is extremely hard to wrap my brain around. I know I need to know it for the test, but how many Network Admins out there use IPv6 for their internal networks or even Router to Router connections? This reminds me of the Microsoft MCSE test questions about linking a server from New York to Tokio to Berlin, that 90% of us never used, yet was somehow 50% of the study guide and questions.

                              <span>When I started here things were great and the workload was bearable. Since then things have done a nearly complete 180. I have ~600 users and 2 facilities to manage with only 1 other person on the team, providing 24/7 support. I was told there would be a scheduled rotation for on call but they keep stringing that along and I get called back in at least 2x per week. I am also expected to check my emails and reply 24/7. 
 I have another offer in hand, relatively same pay, better benefits, and a promising culture. Is having a 3 month stint on your resume that bad? I&#x27;d also feel bad for getting trained up and then leaving almost immediately, but I refuse to work somewhere that values their employees so little.

                              <span>About 3 weeks ago I posted in here about some extreme burnout. TLDR on that: I&#x27;ve been in the field for 25 years, and have one of the best jobs I&#x27;ve ever had, so feeling this level of burnout let me know it was all too real. 
 I got some really good words, camaraderie, and advice from this community. I had already been taking some responsibility on our Azure defender for cloud solution, and I&#x27;m happy to report that my boss supports me jumping in with both feet and getting more on the security side of our operations. 
 This has reinvigorated me within IT. I have already completed the AZ-500 coursework, and have the cert scheduled for next week. I have not failed a single practice test yet. The stuff just makes sense to me, it clicks. Then I plan on pursuing the SC-100 to obtain my Azure cybersecurity architect expert cert, and hopefully have that done here in the next month or two. 
 I wanted to thank everybody that came in and showed me some support and camaraderie when I was down in the dumps and not seeing a way out. I took some of your advice and I&#x27;m running with it, and happy to report that I am interested and excited again in the things I am now doing.
 From an old salty dog in this industry, a big thanks to my fellow IT warriors out here.

 If you are charging multiple tablets in an enclosed area, make sure they are not stacked on each other and have proper airflow around them. A school a mile from house had a fire over the weekend due to iPads charging while being stacked on each in an area with no real airflow.

                              <span>1. always make a backup prior to changes.
  a. validate your backups, often. 
 
2. keep it simple stupid.
 
3. always file a change request.
  a. They validate your thought process and procedure, and they cover your behind because someone has to approve your change. 
 
4. if it&#x27;s not broke, don&#x27;t &quot;fix&quot; it.
 
5. validate your own stuff before blaming others (esp if you think it&#x27;s the network).
 
6. when all else fails, reboot.
  a. unless it&#x27;s Solaris, NEVER reboot Solaris. 
 
7. Never lie about breaking something.
  I&#x27;ll be pissed, but I&#x27;ll be more pissed if I spend 10 hours looking at something I could have spent 10min on if you&#x27;d owned your mistake. 
 
8. Never work for a company that fires people for honest mistakes they owned up to.
 
9. Try to learn something new every day.
 
10. Always 3 there should be, no more, no less.
  a. environments (dev, uat, prd). 
 
 ** Bonuses**
 None of us is as smart as all of us
 you don&#x27;t pay me, I don&#x27;t work.
 if you are a lead, and you call people in, go in as well. it&#x27;s only right.
 if it has to be done regularly and repeatedly, even if it takes just a couple of minutes it needs to be a shell script and a cron job.
 automate, automate, automate.
 you want to be the guy sitting around drinking coffee surfing the web. if you aren&#x27;t something is wrong. Your boss should understand this.
 raid 0 is raid 0. meaning you never recover anything. 2 parity disks there should be.

                              <span>Currently we are dealing with a client that has about 40 machines at their business. About 2 weeks ago, 3 users began reporting they could not connect to the internet. When the issue gets reported, we can&#x27;t use our remote connection software to connect to the computer, however, we can remote connect to the domain controller and use remote desktop to log into the users computer. We have checked firewall settings, DNS settings, checked the switch, no network drops, very confused by this. This morning we had a new user report they could not connect to the internet. Meanwhile the other computers in the office are connected with no issues. The disconnects are so random and it will only happen on a few computers at a time in different areas of the office.

                              <span>My organization wants to set a conditional access policy that will allow mobile devices to not be prompted to reauthenticate for 90 days, but will force offsite users who access M365 via web browser to reauthenticate every time that the user accesses the service.
 My thought was that I would use the Session &#x3D;&gt; Persistent browser session control, set to never persistent, apply to all devices, exclude iOS and Android devices, and of course apply to external locations only.
 Is this the best way for me to meet my organization&#x27;s requirements?

                              <span>So currently we are transitioning to a new print server bc are old printer server is being decommissioned. All printers have been transferred to new server. The problem is that all users are still printing of the old server. We have set up a GPO to deploy printers to pcs from the new print server. What we are having trouble with is removing those old printer connections from user PCs. Those old connections were not deployed via GPO and were all added manually. What i am looking for is an effiecient way of removing all old printer connections from user computers without having to remote into each PC and manually remove it.

                              <span>I currently have a 10 foot USB-C console cable. I am looking for a better way to manage this cable rather than rolling it up and putting it in the plastic bag it came in and throwing it in my backpack each time I use, it traveling from site to site. Is there something commercially that I can purchase this length that would work for me?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 We currently run pfSense on our own hardware.
 We have a vendor pitching to replace our firewall, and they are suggesting WatchGuard Firebox M290.
 We have are approaching 300 endpoints.
 I am seeking opinions on these products, pfSense appliances, and other vendors appliances. What do you love? What do you hate?

 &quot;The network interface &quot;Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Network Connection&quot; has begun resetting. There will be a momentary disruption in network connectivity while the hardware resets. Reason: The network driver detected that its hardware has stopped responding to commands.&quot;
 It&#x27;s a Server 2022 in 7.0 VMWare environment with the latest patch on the ESXi hosts. I was thinking maybe a VMWare tools issue.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have the task of trying to get our WSUS server working correctly as it&#x27;s been left in an unusable state.
 I would not consider myself experienced with WSUS or scripting however I&#x27;m always willing to learn and try my best!
 WSUS is currently running on Windows Sever 2012 R2 VM.
 WSUS Version: 6.3.9600 18694
 The two big issues I&#x27;m facing is it is extremely slow and it constantly crashes with failed snap in errors. with the majority of devices not being up to date.
 The cause in my eyes looks to be the fact the driver specification was ticked, meaning we have 674987 updates unapproved.
 I would like to decline all driver updates and purge them from WSUS and just have security updates and feature updates.
 I have unticked the driver classification and ran the WSUS Server clean-up wizard. However it does not seem to remove the current set of unapproved updates. I have also tried to run some script&#x27;s found online but alas this has not worked either.
 Would really appreciate some help as I&#x27;m really struggling to make progress on this one.
 Thanks
 Sam

Although it has worked on some machines. I noticed the Microsoft Defender Antivirus Service is not running on these machines as it is set to Manual. Whereas the working ones are set to Automatic and running. Any idea why this is?

                              <span>I&#x27;m really not sure what&#x27;s going on I dont have admin permission on this computer heres what happened:
 1-Low hdd space while having many tabs open on chromeNoticed an extension is now corrupted, exited through taskbarImmediately freespace went from 5gb 30gb, all the extensions chrome had were removed
 2- Copied from my backup to chrome appdata to makeup for what was lost3- empty space becomes 45gb, then 55gb. All appdata local folder have been deleted with exception of open apps.
 4- decide to copy my dektop to my external backup.Suddenlly notice space is not decreasing in the backup and the folder that had the backup had its folders disappear.(I had copied all my userdata to an EXTERNAL hdd, was copying from appdata there, but then appdata in the external hdd disappeared, however when i searched for it, i found one of the files inside it now in a folder called &quot;local settings&quot; and appdata folder had disappeared, furthermore this &quot;Local Settings&quot; folder DID NOT EXIST, it was not viewable from the explorer despite being searchable and despite having hidden folders available
 5- Panic. Restart the computer. Upon starting it said applying global security measures because of some update. Now All the shortcuts have now been deleted. and taskbar looks like this, there are these folder that are neither visible on explorer nor do i have access to I used treefoldersize to find them. I&#x27;m beyond confused. Other than the appdata, the other folders are still there, but i&#x27;m not sure how to copy them now.
 Help would be appreciated
 Edit: Just realised on-screen keyboard has also disappeared and is no longer installed.

                              <span>We have been looking through our cloud storage providers, and seem to have 4 different ones we pay for. My girlfriend as a office 365 personal subscription, with 1TB. She uses many apps that are with it
 My idea is to move all our photos, documents video, and music to the 1 TB on 365. Then cancel all other subscriptions.
 A few questions, there seems to be a few different options for 365, if all the files go onto the personal account/cloud, can I from my one drive ,view everything if it is set to share with my MS account?
 Wondering whether to get the 365 family, apart from the 1TB per user, is there any advantage?
 All the apps/software which is available,is not really something I need.
 I also came across 365 Pro Plus, which I cannot figure out what it is exactly. It seems to be a one time payment, with the same as 365 personal or family is a renewable licence.
 Can anyone explain the difference?
 I hope this make sense what I ask.
 Thanks

                              <span>Before I begin I want to say I love the work part of my job, I inherited such an out of date and poorly managed environment that I&#x27;m basically given carte blanche to fix it by my boss (CIO), who&#x27;s a great guy and was hired after me. I get to learn new stuff every day and absolutely adore that. Now to my question. How do you deal with office politics? I interface often with our c suite due to our helpdesk being very inexperienced so I end up spending about 15 hours a week fixing printers and explaining how to use word to people who make 3x what I do. I don&#x27;t mind that part so much but it&#x27;s a vipers nest up there and they keep dragging me into it. My boss does what he can and tells me to point them to him but then the same people are just even more pissed at me. I&#x27;m now getting more and more angry about the situations I&#x27;m pulled in to, mostly the accusations that IT doesn&#x27;t do anything while I&#x27;m working 50-60 hour weeks to keep thing halfway working while I upgrade as much as I can. Any advice the greybeards can give?

 I&#x27;m trying to host a local Winget repo using Gitlab and I&#x27;m struggling to find any documentation/guides on doing this. Does anybody know whether it&#x27;s possible and/or have a guide please?
 ​
 The public MS repos don&#x27;t have all the software I need and the ones that are there are out of date.
 ​
 Thanking you guys in advance!

                              <span>Lately I’ve been thinking about how meaningless my current role at an MSP can feel. It doesn’t really contribute anything to society other than making the investors money. 
 It’s nice to be able to help customers, but many of those customers can equally be soulless money making businesses.
 Has anyone moved into an area in tech for a company or project where you feel you are making a difference?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m looking for a tool to monitor the connection to one of my servers, I have a feeling that the connection is resetting / dropping for a split second, not enough to show as a drop but enough to kick users off.
 I&#x27;ve tried ping monitoring but they are going through fine, I need something that is going to establish a connection between to points, either from a desktop to the server, or server to server to open a connection and keep it open, then monitor if it drops out.
 I&#x27;ve got either the same or similar issue on two sites, both running unifi kit, one is effecting sage 50, the other RDP connections!
 Ideally something open source/free!

                              <span>Some of our users that travel to different locations and use computers that do not belong to use have downloaded and installed O365 on computers that are not managed by us. I have realized by using https://config.office.com/ to manage build versions that some computers do not belong to us. 
 I guess the way is linked to our firm is by the tenant association key and by generating a new one and associating the right key to the software would be a solution. This seems to be a bit far fetched and I would like to simplify it. 
 On the section https://myaccount.microsoft.com/device-list it gives you the option to disable device. What does this exactly do? It cannot possibly disable the computer itself right?
 On the section https://portal.office.com/account#installs allows you to sign out from the device but of course the installation will remain there with the organizations tenant association key. 
 The goal being to remove the association of the software and our platform since it is not managed by us anymore, what are your thoughts?

                              <span>Hello fellow admins,
 to avoid confusion, i am already auditing my NPS server for both success and failure. what i need to do is to audit admin configuration changes on the NPS server itself, i.e. i changed few network policies today but i dont see any log about it.
 all the logs from the NPS windows server are being parsed through beats and store in an elastic cluster. i have gone through all the logs from the server but i can only see logs related to authentication clients.
 Microsoft documentation was no help at all and i was unable to find anything remotely useful on the internet.
 please advise.

                              <span>So after posting on here recently about applying Windows Defender Antivirus run in sandbox mode I turned this on as it was off. After running powershell comand to turn on MsMpEngCP.exe is now running after reset which is good. Problem is I looked at settings core isolation memory integrity is now switched off although my BIOS did reset today (another weird issue) which may have caused this.
 However going to Group Policy Editor Navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; Device Guard, on my windows 10 system I do not have device guard folder.
 Used:
 reg add &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard&quot; /v &quot;EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity&quot; /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
 ​
 reg add &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard&quot; /v &quot;RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures&quot; /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

 reg add &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard&quot; /v &quot;Locked&quot; /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

                              <span>Hi guys,
 my predecessor barely documented anything, so the CEO wants me (only IT guy) to work 4d/week on documentation. One day is reserved for user problems.
 Anyways, when I was in school 6 months ago, we didn&#x27;t really learn about documentation &amp; my last place was a shitshow so there was never anything being documented.
 I&#x27;m trying my hardest in at least documenting anything (screenshots, colour coded words, full sentences with reason on why I did this etc.) but my boss really wants me to work like a project manager. 
 He showed me how they work on their annual statements (we are public) but how am I supposed to work exactly like that, when he has 5 people who went to University and have degrees in those things?
 Are there any tips or software I can use to help my process in being more efficient?
 I&#x27;m using yEd to construct a logical plan on how everything is connected etc, but it all takes so much time..
 Thanks for any help!!

 First off though - thank you all for being understanding. I was terrified about bringing up mental health concerns, despite being quite sure this is a big deal in general - and especially amongst my fellow sysadmins. 
 I&#x27;d like to share a few more things I&#x27;ve found out over the intervening month:
  
ADHD has some insanely bad consequences if left untreated. Serious systemic &#x27;life outcome&#x27; vulnerabilities. Your odds of addiction, prison, car accidents, teen parenthood*, depression, burnout and suicide are all a LOT higher.
 
It&#x27;s highly heritable, and a lot of people with ADHD have one or both parents with ADHD. 
 
It&#x27;s not always heritable - some things can cause brain development is…</span>

 Does anyone have a clue what is going on here? Other shares on the same drive and the same server don&#x27;t have such problem..

                              <span>Hi everybody! In the moments of people entering into the company and exiting the company we lose so many time. Creating the account copying permissions, e-mail, licenses, software, phone, add to contact groups, etc.. and the exit, that sometimes de HR dep. don&#x27;t notify in time, is also a running to keep data safe, block accesses, change shares passwords, etc..
 How do you &quot;integrate&quot; this processes with HR department and make this flow?
 Best regards, Good Monday!

                              <span>TL;DR: fortune 100 company uses free and open source software and don&#x27;t give back anything to the community. What can employees do to remediate the situation?
 Working for IT at a fortune 100 company I always come across this dilemma: we use free and open source technologies all across the board to solve issues from data management to network automation. Sometimes I have even came across situations when, on my working hours, I need to solve issues and add functionality to free and open source software solutions.
 The thing is that, the company I work for is not a software company, we don&#x27;t even have corporate GitHub or Gitlab accounts. So usually I just take note of what I did for a specific project and once I&#x27;m home, on my free time, I try to replicate it under my personal account.

                              <span>I want to do that mainly #1 because I feel things are going to break big time and not because there aren’t other people capable out there but because management will continue to try to be cheap and do things wrong - not staff properly. I already see managers try to get close to me positioning themselves to ask for some kind of rescue, which like I said I think there are very capable people out there but the management of the company I’m leaving is broken. Many ppl have left and many have been bought out to stay (in different depts) with big money. So it’s these ppl who are earning big money and trapped into this company that I feel will try to do anything in their power to reach me or have me “rescue” this place IT wise when I’m gone. One already “threatened” - “I’m still going to be calling you” this is one that kept calling nights weekends etc and giving insane amounts of work and bullying my boss to bully me to have things done at the snap of her finger. I know I will block and ignore but at the same time I don’t want to have these distractions when I’m going to be trying to start at a new job, thus thinking about changing my phone.
 What was your reasoning for the ones that did it?

                              <span>Ill try to keep it simple.
 I was basically &quot;guaranteed&quot; a promotion 2 years in a row, but it didn&#x27;t go through... again. It fell through the 2nd annual-review in a row. Now it &quot;should be sometimes in the next few months... just waiting on paperwork to go through.&quot;
 last year, work load increased, then when the promotion failed, workload seemed to decrease. This year, was promised it again, my review was written well, even got a bonus. The raise though, is less than what inflation did to my paycheck (technically, I am making less regarding inflation).
 How much actual work within a company does it take to get promoted - from the upper-management side of things with paperwork and the final decision? I&#x27;ve usually trusted my manager pretty solid, and our communications has been pretty spot on for the many years I&#x27;ve worked with him, but starting to question things... . On the flip side, upper management seems to be constantly in a political battle with themselves over the past 2+ years. trying to get some feedback. Thanks.

                              <span>I know most people do not recommend a standing upgrade. Seems like the easiest solution but could have issues or just plain fail. 
 If we pull up a new hyper-v with 2019 server is there a way to migrate over the file shares? We have a lot and would be a pain.

                              <span>Just a stupid question out of curiosity. 
 You know when you’re watching a movie and some hacker or hacker gang appears and they have some sort of « hacker lab » in an abandoned warehouse somewhere with a bunch of drops and equipment. 
 It always made me wonder as a sysadmin, how do you explain anonymity in such scenarios?
 Like I know it’s fiction and it’s all for show, but as a Sysadmin it kinda bothers me that I cannot explain to myself how such setup could be achieved without being tracked. 
 Like what, do they go up to an ISP and be like “Yo can I get a public IP for my edge router in that creepy abandoned warehouse so I can perform illegal online activities that law enforcement can track back to us through you?”
 Or do they hijack someone else’s line from the DMARC box of the ISP? 
 What are your theories on how such anonymous “hacker labs” can be achieved?
 Just for fun

We’ve been using FogBugz. Is this something that is normal? Are the all in one options worth it, or should I stick with keeping those things separated? For reference I’m not senior in any sense of the word and don’t know what’s being used for things like network management and other infrastructure.

                              <span>Hi All, I have been tasked with researching moving to Windows 11. We are a MS shop with O365 and Azure. We have a fairly modern fleet of workstations and laptops. We are a Hybrid AD environment.
 Our current system of deployment is a golden image through a local imaging system. I believe now is the time to get into bed Intune, Auto Pilot and all that goodness.
 Does anyone have any good whitepapers or sites discussing this in some clear concise ways? Any hints or pit falls that I must avoid?
 I am thinking to start I will document our current GPs etc and ensure we replicate the used and useful ones in to Azure Ad and then look to having all our WIN11 managed through there, then move the Win10 stuff into it. All with LOTS of testing first.
 Any big hints?
 Thanks

 (Note: I&#x27;ve heard plenty of &quot;Dont do it&quot; due to managing terrible people, losing touch with tech, and other reasons but i think this environment meets my goals, at least for now. Looking for others&#x27; experiences too!)
 Edit: I&#x27;m currently one of the team / internal promotion.

 Which certifications would you suggest for gaining additional general IT knowledge and improving credibility while transitioning from a help desk role if already possesing a bachelor&#x27;s in IT? In your opinion, are there any certifications that hold greater significance in the industry or are more highly valued by employers?
 I&#x27;m grateful for any insight you can offer -- thanks in advance for your help!

 Since I am starting from the scratch, I wanna build it so that it can scale with the growth of the company. So I am planning to host this on the web, so that in the future multiple admins can manage it. And also so that manager&#x27;s can view/check their teams assets.I need to ensure all the integration&#x27;s are setup like mail and slack as well.
 I am a noob at hosting things but I am happy to learn and try. Just wanted to know how I should go about this ?

                              <span>Sending out an APB for anyone that might understand challenges around providing IT services in Harare, Zimbabwe.
 Long story short, I recently resigned from my IT director role. I&#x27;m fortunate to have some FU money saved up and I&#x27;m taking some time off before I take on my next role. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve been invited by a colleague to provide some guidance on the building out of tech services at a new facility in Zimbabwe. For me, it&#x27;s a great opportunity to help an area of the world that may be lacking in IT expertise and I also love to travel.
 While I&#x27;ve been in IT for 25 years and have built many a network, server farm, office build out, etc. from scratch, I have no idea what specific challenges there might be around things like internet service, acquiring hardware and support, malware protection, and email.
 If there is anyone that might be up for a quick conversation, I would really appreciate it.

 Post, or pm Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am quite new here and I hope the big reddit community can help me to find the best ERP for my new company ;)
 Let me start by introducing my work. I started a kind of trading company few months ago, focused on customized B2B products.
 I am based physically in China and manage orders for customers in Europe (as for now, always open to new business...) My main scope of business now is company gifts, meaning I have a lot of rather small orders, but many each week. My company is only few months old and I cannot afford a payable or customized ERP unfortunately, so I&#x27;m looking for a self-deployable ERP that could meet most of my requirements.
 Usually, I receive an inquiry from my client, &quot;can you get 300 of these with custom logo ?&quot;. Then I make some sourcing if I don&#x27;t already…</span>

                              <span>A bit of background: My company is a professional services firm and currently use Deltek to archive/store all emails for all project related communication. It integrates into Outlook with an addin and users currently have to manually archive emails into Deltek. Issue is, this system has constant issues (compatability, crashing, extremely slow and a bunch of orher issues with add unnecessary delays within a users day to day tasks.
 Can someone please recommend a solution?
 What we need is something that integrates into 365 seemlessly and all emails with all data (attachments) need to be searchable and easily accessible (preferably from within outlook.
 Ywars ago, another company i used to work at used Enterprise Vault. As my memory recalls, it was so seemless. All current and archived emails all show within outlook. You could double click on an archived email and as that email is opening, enterprise vault used to retrieve the data from the backend and present it as if its just another current email.
 I dont know of any other solutions or if Enterprise Vault is still worth it.
 All suggestions welcome.

                              <span>Since we (research institution with about 30k mailboxes) have migrated our mail-gateway to Microsoft Cloud using Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO) we are experiencing a very high rate of false positives in regards to junk mails (in comparison to our former solution). Our anti-spam policy is, as of now, set to the weakest setting and unfortunately, we are not seeing any improvement by training the AI. There is no really help from Microsoft. The escalations we already made do not bring any solution. The want to sell us a high price support contract although we&#x27;ve evidence the spam detection respectively the AI is bad (much too agressive). We&#x27;re in contact with another organisation they&#x27;ve been fighting with this behaviour since about 5 years. 
 Fun fact also serious mails from MS or other organisation/companys using EOP, MDO and Exchange Online are classified as spam.
 Has anybody similar experience like we?
 And found a way to tweak it?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just curious if any of you have any script of connecting remotely to a list of servers and executing Windows update? 
 I do have a script but this script obly works on the local machine but when i connect remotely to the same machine via Powershell, the script fails. 
 In my script, it references a list of servers in a text file and then it loops and execute command on one server at a time.
 Wondering if any of you have a similar script that works?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just set up a small Apache VM and enabled the HTTP/2 module as described in the documentation (HTTP/2 guide). To test it out, the recommendation is to use the non-browser client curl. However, I&#x27;m noticing some strange issues.
 When curl is told to use HTTP2 (curl --http2), Apache writes 2 lines in the access.log instead of the usual single line. Moreover, the date of the 1st line is completely wrong (sometimes even empty) and the protocol of 2nd line is HTTP/1.1 instead of the expected HTTP/2:
 192.168.122.1 - - [31/Dec/1969:21:00:00 -0300] &quot;GET / HTTP/2.0&quot; 200 10922 &quot;-&quot; &quot;curl/7.74.0&quot; 192.168.122.1 - - [19/Mar/2023:04:55:34 -0300] &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1&quot; 101 10967 &quot;-&quot; &quot;curl/7.74.0&quot; 
 Here&#x27;s a couple more examples of such issues in access.log:
 192.168.122.1 - - &quot;GET / HTTP/2.0&quot; 200 10922 &quot;-…</span>

                              <span>Say I have N different servers each serving it&#x27;s own webapp. I want to put these servers behind a reverse proxy, but now I created a single point of failure: if my reverse proxy is going to fail I wont be able to access any of these webapps.
 ​
 Is it possible to scale my reverse proxies up to 2-3 machines? My guess would be to setup local DNS and keep DNS server monitoring for main rpxory status, then switch &#x27;A&#x27; record to another rpoxy if it fails, but I don&#x27;t know how to implement this switchover (if it&#x27;s even possible) and now it seems that this local DNS is going to be SPOF, so...
 ​
 Q: Why do you want to use rproxy and/or local DNS?
 A: To ease maintenance of the system. I can quickly change which domain (or ip) points to which machine and it&#x27;s port (in case of rproxy).
 ​
 (If exact products relevant to this problem, I would use nginx as rproxy and bind9 as local DNS)

My question is, is it worth having Credential Guard &amp; Key Guard running in Windows 10 if I&#x27;am not sure it is actually doing anything?

                              <span>I work in platform support, low headcount, some people don&#x27;t care. I wondered what happens when I don&#x27;t care anymore.
 A ticket was not processed for 2 shifts. There&#x27;s no consequences for them, its the 3rd time they&#x27;ve done this and they just seem to be pushing their luck on what they can get away with.
 I am a career shifter, very early in the career but I&#x27;ve been the one who has been carrying these guys who are paid more.
 These are people that failed me when I was graded on teamwork, because I don&#x27;t join for drinks (I honestly don&#x27;t care for them after the job, I am paid to do work and not more). No amount of complaining to my manager made a difference.
  
My action:
 As of now, whenever a shift has anything unhandled, and it was a deliberate act of ignoring the issue, i log it as &quot;unprocessed by Nightshift. No Handover, no notes provided.&quot;

 A high level description is enough as everyone is bound by confidentiality.
 It would be helpful if someone explains it to me :)

                              <span>I have seen far too many &quot;spot the phish&quot; presentation that dissect a poor quality scam email, and point out the mistakes in it. 
 This is sending entirely the wrong message, because your users are now thinking that&#x27;s how you detect scams. 
 When all that does is weed out the poor quality ones, and you make them more susceptible to the well crafted ones, because they think they know better. 
 But scammers aren&#x27;t all careless. Most of the carelessness is deliberately filtering for victims already. 
 I have seen some very high quality spear-phishing attempts recently, that don&#x27;t have &quot;mistakes&quot; in them. They have email addresses that look very plausible - sometimes spoofed, sometimes belonging to the .co.uk for a .com or similar.
 Occasionally coming from a personal email that looks like it could be a legitimate member of staff. Etc. 
 But elegantly crafted, personalised and a very plausible sort of request or warning. 
 The only way to spot these is to be skeptical about all of them. Don&#x27;t rely on lazy scammers to be obvious about it, because that makes you vulnerable to the ones that aren&#x27;t.
 If you want an analogy, then lets go with foraging for mushrooms. There&#x27;s a load of varieties of mushrooms that are edible and very tasty. Some look a bit weird. https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/?mushroom_type&#x3D;edible
 But if I describe to you Fly Agaric and you avoid that, it still doesn&#x27;t make the Destroying Angel safe to eat!
 (Seriously - don&#x27;t go foraging mushrooms unless you are VERY sure you recognise exactly which varieties are &#x27;safe&#x27;, and never ever eat one you&#x27;re even slightly unsure about).

 About a month into employment my boss found out I&#x27;m into homelabs and have the ability to take over their IT responsibilities from their MSP. Not my call.
 So I&#x27;m a bit wishy washy on whether they intend me to be their head of IT, be on-site for emergencies, answer support tickets, and plan, develop and migrate their core network and servers and all their licenses for 22/hr.
 Somethings not adding up.
 So I&#x27;m trying to make a list of everything that I&#x27;ll be doing, see: https://pastebin.com/raw/zgr18M7Z
 What should I add to the bottom where my monthly fees should be and my responsibilities are? 
 I&#x27;ve never done a job like this and I think they&#x27;re banking on me feeling I&#x27;ll-confident so I don&#x27;t ask for more pay but coursing me into doing the entire work of their MSP and handling the migration for what I think is not a 22/hr job

                              <span>Working on a small network utility, so wanted to get your opinion about UDP traffic. UDP traffic to/from Internet is usually blocked on corporate/school networks. Is it also disabled between devices on LAN i.e. two employee computers in office, or between computers in a university lab etc? 
 Seems like on corporate it usually isn&#x27;t blocked, but not sure about schools/universities, seems like they go out of way to block a lot of stuff ie games, some voip apps etc.

                              <span>Long story short, we have a very remote site with two DCs and a handful of workstations. Everything has been powered off and is now reaching the 180 day mark, so we expect it to be tombstoned when the equipment is all started back up.
 For logistical reasons there may not be a way to get personnel on site before the equipment needs to be powered back up, and it may be a PITA to resolve the AD issues remotely as the only means of access is via relatively slow satellite internet. It&#x27;s doable but not fun at all. 
 Is it possible to &quot;trick&quot; the domain into avoiding the tombstone at powerup? Say for example, going into each machine at initial powerup before the OS is loaded and setting the BIOS clock back close to the last time the domain was live, and then moving the clock forward after all the machines have synced up? The machines will not have an external NTP time source initially so we don&#x27;t expect that they will magically fix their clocks until we do it manually.
 Thanks!

                              <span>As I was ordering a replacement near infrared IR sensor card which allows me to check for light on fiber and SFP modules, I looked around to see if it was mentioned here, and to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t. In a pinch I&#x27;ve found it to be small, portable (goes in a pocket or wallet), very convenient when troubleshooting cross connects at a datacenter without constantly needing a light meter. The cost is steep at first for the F-IRC2-F (https://www.newport.com/p/F-IRC2-F) card I use, but is actually cheap when compared to their other cards (https://www.newport.com/f/near-infrared-nir-sensor-cards). It also works on CWDM + DWDM frequencies too.
 I hope this doesn&#x27;t come off as a promoting a product persay, but wanted to show off a fantastic tool I&#x27;ve used for years, to my fellow colleagues.

                              <span>Hello, Can anyone point to a “best practise” network design for a branch office using dual active-active sdwan devices?
 Specifically, wondering how is suggested to connect the Sdwan devices to the LAN ie using iBGP? Or Ebgp?
 How do the devices do active-active? Is there a floating active IP address or what?
 Do you need to manipulate traffic (with BGP) to send it to the primary device or how does it work?
 Thanks

                              <span>I work for a small company that has one remote office in Malaysia. There are around 20 employees in the office. Our headquarters is around 160 and located in Maine. 
 I’ve been struggling to find a solid solution for reliable connectivity. We have on prem ERP and CAD software as well as file shares. 
 We are currently testing a China Telcom SD WAN solution. It gave us a modest increase in bandwidth (6M). I expected the latency to increase due to last mile hops. Latency went from 280ms to 300ms. The problem is that we still have more than acceptable packet loss. There are periods of 10-20% loss. China Telcom’s support has been unable to assist us with troubleshooting this packet loss. I’m close to pulling the POC and going back to the IP-SEC tunnel between our firewalls. 
 My goal is to provide stable connectivity. Any thoughts or suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

 I am 27 years old and I am working as a network administrator for 1 year at a pretty big ISP in Romania. Before that I worked for 4 years in technical support (networking) at the same company. My question is, what is the next step I should take after the network administration? I would love to learn cloud, but I have no experience in programming, and I have seen job postings that were pretty demanding. Do you have any other advices? What should I learn further? Python? AWS?I know 1 year in network administration is not much, but I am still learning and trying to become better at it.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey community, 
 I wanted to start a discussion on network architecture. Specifically, I&#x27;m curious about your experiences with stacking in the Core layer. Do the networks you work on allow for this? What are the pros and cons you&#x27;ve encountered? 
 On one hand, there&#x27;s the benefit of having a single management and reduced dependency on STP, bundling of links (ether channels), eliminating need for HSRP but on the other hand there are also the potential downsides such as a single point of failure and upgrades difficulty in software upgrade’s especially in critical operations environments where downtime is extremely difficult.
 Let&#x27;s hear your thoughts and experiences!

                              <span>Client has a really old VNX san that still appears to have some production servers on it. In the past I used to use a mobile version of Firefox to address accessing older equipment via web browser.
 At first I received an SSL Cipher mismatch issues in Firefox which I was able to address ria changing the minimum TLS flag. However after that I get the following error - Error code: SSL_ERROR_UNKNOWN_CA_ALERT
 Just wondering what you guys are using to access old/out dated equipment?

                              <span>My boss’s boss is urging me to apply for a sysadmin job within our company. I know that I’m a good worker, I make shit happen and always on top of my ticket queue. 
 I’m currently a T2 support for about 6 years now. Our Sr sysadmin guy unexpectedly quit and now our our sysadmin guy moved up. As a T2 support, I handle SCCM stuff, MDM and escalation from our Tier 1s and very well in my comfort zone. 
 The new gig comes with a 8K paybump but probably stressful as heck especially during adjustment period for me. I took a peek at the sysadmin guy’s queue and I got terrified. Lots of unknowns and things that I wouldn’t have any clue how to do. Is this normal? I haven’t accepted the job yet as I told both my boss and his boss that I’ll be thinking about it over the weekend. 
 It took a lot from me to get to this expertise level to a point that I don’t even get stressed anymore since I’m very comfortable at doing this job. How did you guys made the jump? 
 When I first became a T2, I was stressed AF and lost some sleep. Me, being a young Dad l, with 2 young boys makes me want to turn down this opportunity. My spouse thinks I will absolutely kill this job once I get the hang of it.

                              <span>Joined a company where so far we have been accumulating old gear. Our current e-waste vendor does not take hard disks.
 I have accumulated around 100 old disks and that might go up to no more than 1000 in the next few years. The CYA disposal way is to destroy them ourselves.
 Anyone have a specific recommendation for some simple safe and cheap destroying device? 
 We have stuff like a drill press available but that seems more laborious than it could be.

                              <span>Last year I started a new position with a relativity small IT team supporting a very complex and geographically diverse set of IT assets. It&#x27;s been really frustrating since so many tools and processes which are common in most other IT organizations seems to be missing entirely from this one. 
 ​
  
No ticketing system
 No project management system
 No change management system
 No systems documentation or runbooks
 No systems monitoring tools
 No out of band management
 No system imaging solution
 No asset management solution
 No software deployment solution
 Inadequate data protection for core assets
 File shares residing on fast SSD storage but without snapshots
 VM&#x27;s hosting databases running on slow HD storage
 Multiple instances of vSphere, each with their own VCSA, but with no HA clusters defined
 ESXi hosts all maxed out with no remaining capacity to vmotion anything off
 Electrically overloaded datacenters, PDU&#x27;s, UPS&#x27;s, etc.
 Most server hardware well past EOL
  
The list goes on an on. Each day I am discovering some new problem.
 While the IT manager admits some of this is problematic, we&#x27;re in the process of building out yet more complexity without pausing to fix any of these underlying structural deficits. This leaves me wondering whether I should just toss in the towel and go look for another job.

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting real tired of lazy sysadmins who don&#x27;t document anything then expect other people to support it.
 These are the people I don&#x27;t feel guilty for calling after hours or when they&#x27;re on PTO to ask basic questions because of the lack of documentation when something breaks.
 Are they even teaching documentation in schools? I don&#x27;t remember ever being told to document or even how to document. 
 Even certs like A+, Net+, CCNA, or the few mcse courses I&#x27;m familiar with. None of them talk about the importance of documentation. The closest might be LAN/WAN diagrams or taking backups.
 My company even provides access to an online learning system and there are no specific courses on documentation or technical writing.
 Any time I work on or deploy a new system or software, there&#x27;s usually a combination of three types of documentation I create; End User (if needed), information for the IT team to support/troubleshoot and personal notes (such as articles referenced during setup, steps to reproduce or other notes that wouldn&#x27;t be beneficial to the team.)
 Even two or three sentences about something could save someone in the future time, headache and hassle.
 Most of the time, I don&#x27;t create documentation for others - I create it for myself so I have something to reference in the future or can send to end users to minimize their need to reach out and bother me.
 Gah!

                              <span>I started a new position recently and I haven’t had to do endpoint management for years. I’ve been a VMware, servers and storage guy. Anyways, my only 2 requirements are endpoint deployment (I used to use ghost back in the day; that’s how long it’s been since I had to do this kind of stuff) and patch management. All other features are just a nice to have. Intune and SCCM are not an option. I know there’s Ninja One and Atera (among others). They seem to have what I’m looking for but I’d like to get opinions outside my head. What are your recommendations? Edit: thanks for the input folks. I appreciate your suggestions. I’ll dig in to them.

                              <span>After all these years there has got to be a term or relevant XKCD about these kinds of folks. I&#x27;m sure many of us work with one, or have worked with one. 
 The person who intentionally sets things up in such a complicated way that only they know how to administer it, maybe to feel a sense of importance or job security? 
 We have an admin who refuses to use a windows computer and does everything via Mac, even though our environment is 99% windows. We have a small team of media relations people who use Mac for graphic design, video editing, and a few apps that are specific to Mac. This is around 3 people. 
 This same admin, when tasked with rebuilding a Windows 2012 file server, insists on using Linux/Samba because it &quot;will probably play nicer with the Macs&quot;. This is 2023, I highly doubt a Mac can&#x27;t connect to a Windows SMB share. At the same time, he also insists on running BIND DNS inside a FLAR container on Solaris, when he is the only one that knows Solaris - these boxes also haven&#x27;t been patched in years and run insecure versions of BIND.
 What do you call these people? Does anyone else have similar stories?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m a new system administrator at a company that recently had a major server failure, and it was quite the experience. The server was hosting six production VMs, and due to a single PSU failure and motherboard issue(My finding), it completely failed. The worst part was that the previous system administrator had not backed up the critical databases.
 As the new guy, I was tasked with recovering the databases, and I was totally freaked out. I tried to recover the databases, but the server was unable to POST the ESXi, which made things even more challenging. After some trial and error, I decided to unmount the server from the rack and take it to my desk. I disassembled the server, removed the RAM, cleaned it with a vacuum, and rested it for over 10 hours.
 To my surprise, the hypervisor loaded successfully, and I was able to dump the six database files from one VM. However, the server suddenly went down, and I was unable to shift the dumped files. I tried again, and after a few attempts, the server worked for two hours before crashing again.
 At this point, I knew I had to act fast. I backed up everything and restored the system the next day, which was a challenging task, but I managed to get it done.
 I&#x27;m curious to hear about your experiences with server failures and database recovery. What are some of the worst cases you&#x27;ve encountered? And how did you handle them? Let&#x27;s share our stories and learn from each other.

Recently I learned about port security which can be used to prevent someone plugging in a router and connect unauthorized devices to the network. As I&#x27;m a noob, I asked GPT to help me prevent someone plugging in a router, and TADA I got my answer. https://ibb.co/7RKpsrG 
 Do you also use it to learn things that you wanted to do and didn&#x27;t get answers quickly as expected or too lazy to search? BTW, is it going to lessen the number of jobs by having idea about many things?

 Zero.
 I made a post of a while back on a different account about hating my manager. He manipulated and micromanaged me, spoke to me like crap, threw temper tantrums, screaming, the works. He&#x27;d give really excessive praise one minute and then absolutely rip you to shreds a few hours later. My mental health was seriously suffering. It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for me to just get drunk alone after work to cope with his bullshit. I remain convinced he is narcissistic. 
 I followed the golden advice of this sub and got the fuck outta there (with a nice pay rise too!). Working my notice period didn&#x27;t go quite to plan (they then started to target me specifically, even in front of HR) so I just said fuck it and never went back.
 I am SO much happier in my new job. Is there fuck tonnes to do? Yes. Does my manager want updates on every little thing and start screaming at me the second he misunderstands something? Nope. He is so chilled. I don&#x27;t think this guy has ever stressed about anything in his life. 
 Apologies for the client click bait title. I guess all I wanted to share was that if you&#x27;re unhappy, just leave. Despite the &quot;impending recession&quot;, the IT market is still going strong. Thank you guys, I love this community.

                              <span>Hi all- We have an existing RDS cluster with 8 session hosts and FSLogix that works reasonably well for ~80 users. The customer is interested in a RDS load balancing option that will consider CPU/RAM utilization on the session hosts in determining which server to put a new connection on. The built-in load balancing that the RDS gateway does is basically only number of users, with no consideration around metrics. It looks like there are a few third party apps that do this. Does anyone have a recommendation around this, and most importantly - can it be added on top of an existing RDS deployment? We&#x27;re not interested in rebuilding things if we can avoid it. Thank you!

                              <span>I need to find a solution to replace our numerous scheduled robocopy batch jobs on multiple computers.
 The most common configuration is weekly, daily or on demand copy of files from one or up to three directories to a SMB share. It&#x27;s currently deployed on ~100 computers which are in an isolated network which has no access to the internet or any cloud services.
 Goals I&#x27;d like to accomplish are
  
some kind of monigoring to keep track if a planned copy job failed, didn&#x27;t start or didn&#x27;t finish i.e. client was turned off, client couldn&#x27;t reach the network etc.
 (optionally) some kind of dashboard
 easy to deploy and configure for our first line
 possible to run with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account
  
Couple of products I reviewed either:
  
reliead on java (too many problems if a client relieas on a different version of java, also a resource hog),
 cloud (not acceptable security-wise),
 relied on a dedicated server as a worker (bottlenetck).
  
This is a last resort question before I start to design my own solution. Any input appreciated!

 Visited again 2 years ago and it was garbage.
 Visited just now and it still requires considerable amount of time troubleshooting.
 I have device targeted apps in Intune across alot of SMB clients working no problem, so the enrollment process is working as a prerequisite to Autopilot, just fine.
 First Autopilot throws a 0x81036502 app error. Attempting to pull MDM Logs from Autopilot GUI on client throws an 0x800700 Access Denied error.
 Attempting to dump the logs on c:\ through cmd fails with same error, ok fine MS says cannot dump on root.
 Tries to dump on USB stick and then again all new 0x000000 error.
 .... Autopilot still total garbage.
 At this point its still more reliable to enroll with an install/demo user, hand to client and change primary user.

 A few months ago at my job, I managed to transfer 5PB of data across continents with just these tools tools - rsync, gnu parallel, tmux and gdu. Had to use these tools because the environments didnt allow to install any other ones. This was my first time doing a transfer of such a scale with such tight constraints on tools and managed to complete it in approx. 3 months. Given this information, I wanted to know what the wider market thinks of this. How much would you give this effort out of 10? Or on a scale of (1) I&#x27;d hire you for triple the pay (2) Ok. Back to work (3) Meh, who cares! Thanks!

                              <span>I was one of a few students to be recommended for a paid internship as system admin woot! Two years ago I decided it was time for a career change so it has been a lot of hard work to get to this point, and I am kind of at a loss.
 I am super excited but have no idea what to expect and feel completely unqualified. Being in my third semester of a community college, and having done a lot of self study/homelab stuff and kicking butt in a CTF competition is what got me recognized and recommended for the position, but I don&#x27;t think those experiences will amount to much in the face of real infrastructure which is an awesome opportunity to learn, but I am very nervous.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a late night of dealing with this issue. We had a notice in one of our old R720 that a drive in the RAID10 went offline. I went out and replaced it like normal. The system is setup with C: as the OS and D: as has the Hyper-V files.
 Typically, a rebuild for this array takes about 12 hours. Right now, it&#x27;s estimating 12 days! The odd thing is, the entire system has slowed to a crawl. Any IO on C: or D: brings the system to a crawl. Programs lock up for a few minutes.
 Looking at the event logs, and I&#x27;m getting a bunch of the following events:
  
Event 9, Hyper-V-StorageVSP - An I/O request for device &#x27;C:\Virtual Hard Disks\XXXX.vhdx&#x27; took 10675 milliseconds to complete. Operation code &#x3D; READ16, Data transfer length &#x3D; 4096, Status &#x3D; SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS. We are getting this error for both C and D drives.
 
Event 129, percsas2i - Reset to device, \Device\RaidPort0, was issued.
 
 We also use VeeamOne and are getting disk latency alarms for both drives.
 I am able to export the VMs across the network to a different system without any issues.
 At this point, I&#x27;m thinking maybe a raid controller or backplane issue. Any thoughts? I&#x27;m super tried so pardon my if my post didn&#x27;t make sense.
 Notes: Yes, I know the R720 is ancient. Everything on it is backed up and safe.

 I&#x27;m trying to come up with a decent naming convention for gMSA (Group Managed Service Account). What do you recommended?
 e.g 
 dev_sql_gmsa
 prd_exch_gmsa

                              <span>Where do you guys document all of your employees application and role access? Currently I have everything stored within Google sheets but there must be a better method for this. For more context my company has about 50 employees and about 5 different departments. Our only directory of employees is Google Workspace. Curious to hear if anyone else in a more startup environment has any advice here, that is better than just a google document.

 I can&#x27;t find a way to store a position number and then create the rules based on the range of position numbers. Example - Position 100 - 200 is accounting, 201 - 299 is Human Resources and so on. 
 2 questions - where can I store the position code on AD and how do I create a rule based on a range for integers?

 A few jobs I was interested in required ccnp, but on the programming portion at the time I was clueless. 
 I&#x27;ve gone through all the materials for ccnp, but I have many certifications already. I really feel like certifications are a never ending rabbit hole. People want palo and cisco certs, but I&#x27;ve also been told nobody cares.
 Regarding python in a week&#x27;s time I&#x27;m already automating backups, checking network states, and delving into programming massive amounts of switches at once. 
 I have ccna security, SonicWALL, Aruba professional etc. 
 Many are still interested there&#x27;s just some jobs that require these certifications. It&#x27;s impossible to collect them all.

                              <span>A community centre I help out with wants to upgrade its wifi provision from a couple of cheap unmanaged 802.11n APs to something a bit better with centralised control and management. We&#x27;re looking at about 5 APs and using a cheap L2 POE switch to power and sort VLANs etc.
 Traditionally I&#x27;d suggest an Ubiquiti Unifi setup, as while the hardware costs are a bit higher you didn&#x27;t need to worry about licencing going forward. However their licencing model seems to have changed, and while buying the APs with a 3-year licence isn&#x27;t too expensive, it does raise questions as to what the costs will be for renewals.
 Can anyone suggest another managed wifi system I could look at and recommend? Budget is an issue otherwise Ruckus and Meraki would be on the table, but I want to avoid the really cheap and nasty solutions as the cost savings would be wiped out in maintenance/service calls

                              <span>Hey All
 By deafult most switch and firewall don&#x27;t have ACL to block Inter VLAN traffic.
 Is there a security need for this? 
 For example I split Data, VoIP and IoT in separate VLANs.
 They can&#x27;t broadcast across VLANs however devices still can be pinged.
 Should I created ACL&#x27;s to stop inter VLAN traffic?
 Let&#x27;s say a VoIP phone was compromised it can&#x27;t broadcast across VLANs. Is there still risk it can find way to other VLANs?
 Respect VLAN main goal is to reduce traffic and broadcast times on a network.
 Do you also use to to secure the network?

                              <span>Hello there,
 Is there a set of rules / best practices for monitoring firewalls? I mean, what are most to have parameters to monitor that are also brand independent and what comes to you mind as extra? Also, if you could mention any usecases with PRTG, that would be awesome. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Howdy- 
 I will be undergoing a hardware refresh at some point this year, replacing my FortiGate 200D and pair of Cisco 3750s, which are both already EOL or soon to be. 
 Currently the core switches act as the gateway.
 With the refresh, I am entertaining the idea of segmenting traffic at the Fortigate, or it being the new gateway. 
 Can the firewall handle that type of traffic? How would that topology look? 
 We are a medium size org, 150 users, 200 devices. No intensive workloads 
 Also currently 1GIG environment, looking to move to 10GIG

 If I connect a WIFI6E AP with a 5GbE port (on its spec it says the port works in 100M/1000M/2500M/5000M speed) to a 1G/10GbE switch (on its spec it says switch ports have auto-sensing 100M/1000M/10000M fixed ports), will the max throughput be 1GbE, or 5GbE speed?
 Thanks

                              <span>Has anyone had experience moving a nexus 3K/9K switch off the 9 firmware train onto the 10 train? The 3548-XL model has just started to have a suggested release of 10.2(5), and one of our customers wants their switches upgraded to it. 
 We&#x27;re willing to do it, but seeing as they&#x27;d be going up onto what seems like an already very well established firmware train, it&#x27;s going to be a lot of reading of release notes to try and understand if anything might break and what&#x27;s actually changing between the major versions. 
 Any actual real life experience whist I read several years of documents would be appreciated, thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I&#x27;m helping out a local charity with some of their IT stuff, a part of this is to move the infrastructure to the cloud to enable better remote working.
 Whilst cloud infrastructure is my bread and butter - Local networking is not a strong suit and I&#x27;m struggling to find a suitable solution.
 My aim is to have the users VPN into the office (In a tunnel all mode kind of mode), and for the cloud resources to then be reachable that way.
 The charity does not have any real onsite networking gear besides an old Technicolor Router, so I&#x27;m wanting to put in place a low-cost hardware solution for a VPN that users can connect to from their laptops. I&#x27;ve done this previously with Sonicwalls, but fear that these might be out of budget. Is there a good low-cost alternative?

                              <span>Hello guys, I’ve a client who sent me a picture of a device testing ports, to demonstrate the ports were not functioning correctly. The device appears to be testing PoE, but for the block of 12 ports all at once, instead of just one. I’ve asked them for info but they have no idea (or willingness to check) who made it or the model etc.
 So, does anyone happen to know about these types of devices, or what this is called? Or something that achieves the same thing? I’ve searched and searched, but only find single port testers. My team has the need to test PoE on switches, often times several dozen, so a device that tests multiple ports like this would be really useful. Thank you!

 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to setup Apache Guacamole (Docker) with LDAP authentication but I&#x27;m getting the error below even when I&#x27;m adding the extension to the right directory, does anyone know how to fix this error? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;m working on linking up an older building with only 50 pair Cat3 voice and RG59 coax, about 100 ft away from another fiber served building. Permitting and utilities work for fiber will take a while. Besides a point-to-point radio, are there any good enterprise/commercial grade MoCA adapters or point-to-point DSL modems that anyone can recommend for 100+ Mbps?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 At a loss and need some help.
 We are a small/medium sized business. 70ish people. Have a Watchguard Router and Unifi AP&#x27;s/Switches.
 Ran into an issue last week where our 16-XG died. Would keep shutting off randomly. Couldn&#x27;t find one available immediately, so had to reroute the cables to a different switch on the rack while we found a replacement.
 Got a USW-Pro-Aggregation to replace it.
 Switched everything to the new one, thought we were all in the clear.
 Started getting emails around 11/11:15 at night that VPN/network was down. Reboot the Watchguard and everything is back up and running. Get the same messages in the morning around 6:30/7 pm. Watchguard reboot fixes it again.
 More of the same all week, thought I might&#x27;ve plugged a cable in wrong somewhere, and that was causing issues. Gone over all of them, and everything looks to be fine. Thought maybe our backups were causing the issue, since they run at around 11pm at night, kinda made sense.
 Turned off Backups last night, same thing happened.
 Turned them back on tonight, and same thing happened.
 In the Unifi Console, the amount of clients on certain switches doubles. The switches at times show a Down speed of 79641 Mbps, but average 300-1000Mbps. Clients also show a huge download. But on the PC&#x27;s I can&#x27;t see anything being downloaded. Looks like there&#x27;s a ton of traffic from the backups using Wireshark. But my knowledge of Wireshark is very limited.
 The only way to get things going again is by rebooting the Watchguard, or one of the network switches.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Because of this thread, I brought it up with my therapist and was just diagnosed conditionally as inattentive ADHD at a late age. I have another appointment with a doctor that is going to go through some things with me to give me a &quot;second opinion&quot; on my conditional diagnosis.
 A month ago when the post was first put out there I read it in full, comments and all, and almost everything that people were putting out there seemed to jive with how I am. 
 I dive deep into MANY MANY things/hobbies I&#x27;m interested, I misplace things easily, I jump from topic to topic, or task to task at work, and many other things that jived with the post/comments.
 My therapist also explained that many folks who undergo many stressors during a young age, like I was brought up, don&#x27;t usually get diagnosed with ADHD. Their brains bar for stress is much higher and it&#x27;s usually chalked up to that. 
 I want to thank /u/sobrique for bringing this topic up and leading me down an enlightening path. 
 I have recently seen on reddit posts after the above post that ADHD is very heavily linked to alcoholism and I with alcoholism. I don&#x27;t drink during the day( or even think about drinking alcohol), and only at night a little too much and things have become unmanageable with relationships in my life. I have been seeking help with alcoholism for quite some time, I had a long hiatus from alcohol and fell back in recently after some stressful situations. I am hoping that this diagnosis, with a coupled medication(dopamine levels normalizing, and not partaking), can help me get off of alcohol and get the old me back. 
 I have blathered on too long and need to go to bed now. I thank you all for being you and reading my post. Their is hope in this world and I love you all. Thank you.

                              <span>I am being asked to get a small business HIPAA compliant. I do M365 setups and administration all of the time and I understand how to enable MFA, legal holds, transport rules, etc. just fine. But even after spending the last half hour on google I can&#x27;t seem to find anything that actually spells out what makes a M365 tenant HIPAA compliant. Everything is just a damn advertisement or article that eventually ends in &quot;Get a free consultation with XYZ&quot; and I&#x27;m like... I know how to do all of the things individually, I just need to know what rules need to be followed so I can put the darn controls in place.
 Is there somewhere I can read the exact requirements/guidelines? Thanks folks

 Are there any decent corporate browsers anymore that aren&#x27;t Chrome or Edge? I&#x27;m actually considering looking at Firefox.
 Edge was actually a decent alternative to Chrome for a bit but they continue to add so much ridiculous bloat to it that it&#x27;s a joke now and I&#x27;m convinced whoever is in charge of that team is on drugs. The list of things I have to disable on Edge via GPO was already huge.

                              <span>We are currently using wrike for many PM stuff as well as ticketing system, which I find to be top basic for proper tracking of IT tickets.
 I&#x27;m newer here and we are a 2 man IT dept that will expect to blow up from 40 or so to nearly 200 total users.
 All we do is cloud based nothing on prem (fyi).
 That said, I want to search for an easy to use ticketing system that we can learn to configure and have our users to use it to submit tickets instead of hitting us up on teams or calls. My goal is to streamline support so this casual walk-up stops and folks submit a ticket.
 Also this ticketing system needs to be hosted by them, as we so not have servers on prem. 
 I have used service desk by manage engine, service now but never as an admin of them.

 I cancelled a Google Calendar event and this was the message I received to the email address the invite was sent from (regarding the cancellation notice).
 I looked at documentation from the recipient&#x27;s DNS (mx1.privateemail.com) and also Google, and my basic knowledge isn&#x27;t helping. The recipient&#x27;s documentation suggests Google rejected this message, but I&#x27;d normally see this the other way around, where the recipient rejected it.
 Did the recipient&#x27;s server reject this due to a high probably of spam? Or did Google reject this and it not send it because there was a high probability of it being spam?
 Thanks for the help

                              <span>Looks like Microsoft released a script to patch Windows RE to fix Bitlocker CVE-2022-41099. See https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41099
 The whole thing made some waves about 2 months ago, like in https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10atdqe/is_bitlocker_forever_compromised/ or https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/108qsob/winre_patching_is_this_new/
 And now Microsoft is giving us a script to fix the issue (for good?): https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5025175-updating-the-winre-partition-on-deployed-devices-to-address-security-vulnerabilities-in-cve-2022-41099-ba6621fa-5a9f-48f1-9ca3-e13eb56fb589

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been sick all week and out of work loop. My boss decommissioned our old Domain Controller, as new ones was set up to take over, and as I show up today none of our printers can no longer scan to e-mail. 
 Our print server is run with SafeQ, but no changes were made to the server or printers. They are all set up to use the SMTP of Exchange 365. So now I&#x27;m wondering exactly what was set up on that old DC that wrecked our printers?

                              <span>Is this a viable option for a corporate intranet with multiple vlans? I don&#x27;t think so, especially with a management network for iDRAC.
 How would you attack iDrac management on a network with no firewall seperation between corporate/guest and iDrac. When the argument is &quot;oh theres no dhcp and theyll be on different subnets anyway&quot;

                              <span>We are running a few older Dell servers that run iDrac 8 and use the java web start for remote viewing. We have been trying to move to openJDK for our Java needs. Has anyone had any luck getting these older iDracs to work with openJDK? I have tried to download a version of OpenJDK 8 (tried both MSI and zip), neither had the javaws.exe. I then tried OpenWebStart, that threw an error when opening the virtual console screen. 
 If you have a solution, would be greatly appreciated.

 I am looking for a hard drive erase bootable program that is free and will wipe the hard drive securely. I want one that supports UEFI so switching bios to legacy mode isn&#x27;t required. Does anyone have any recommendations? I tried Dban but that looks to require legacy boot.

 Is there a way to do in from Exchange? I couldn&#x27;t find anything.
 I tried adding the Room calendar to my calendar. I can see the meeting but there&#x27;s no option to cancel although I have added myself for Full Access.

                              <span>Got tasked today with creating a technical plan to find out if our enterprise is ready for Windows 11. 
 The obvious stuff I can think of (hardware requirements, is software compatible). 
 But what are other things to consider or any caveats?
 We have 99 percent of Windows 10 already, with some Windows 7 for specific tasks. 
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Thought I would post this in case others haven’t thought to leverage Connectwise to install the Office update for CVE-2023-23397. We have 700 on premise domain joined Windows 10 machines in offices and remote/home locations. Moving to Intune soon but not there yet.
 Here&#x27;s what we have done making it a breeze:
  
Notified staff that any MS Office applications left open on the screen would shut down @ 11:00 when we sent the command.
 WOL all office based devices
 Highlighted all machines in Connectwise and sent the command below
  
&quot;C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe&quot; /update user displaylevel&#x3D;false forceappshutdown&#x3D;true 
  
Any machines online updated there and then including machines not logged into.
 For the 300 or so machines not turned on, as and when they have been coming online, they have checked in with Connectwise and the original queued command has then run updating office.
  
Along with using https://config.office.com/ to track progress, In Connectwise we have also used a custom property to store the office version/build and then scope a session group to this to keep track of unpatched versions.
 Command for Custom Property: 
 Get-ItemProperty -Path &#x27;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration&#x27; | Select-Object -ExpandProperty VersionToReport 
 Session Group – Subgroup expression (remember to update refresh custom properties):
 IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE &#x27;*16130.20306&#x27;, &#x27;PATCHED&#x27;, IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE &#x27;*16026.20238&#x27;, &#x27;PATCHED&#x27;, IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE &#x27;*15928.20298&#x27;, &#x27;PATCHED&#x27;, IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE &#x27;*15601.20578&#x27;, &#x27;PATCHED&#x27;, IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE &#x27;*14931.20944&#x27;, &#x27;PATCHED&#x27;, &#x27;NOT PATCHED&#x27;)))))

                              <span>Good Afternoon,
 I was reviewing Microsoft Defenders &#x27;Experts on Demand&#x27; costings, and have seen this has now been rebranded to Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting.
 After talking to the Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting team, it seems we&#x27;re not eligible for a few reasons.
 So my question, does anyone have any alternatives to the &#x27;Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand&#x27; option, to support our Microsoft Defender environment in for any scenarios where incidents are too advanced for our inhouse IT.
 I am not looking for an alternative to &#x27;Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting&#x27;, just the &#x27;Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand&#x27; option.
 Kind Regards,
 Max.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I&#x27;m the developer and owner of a web application that&#x27;s grown in popularity (and so visibility) over the past few years. In the last month or so, this has brought something new our way with a series of what I&#x27;m quite certain are DDoS attacks. Nothing that would crash Facebook, but HTTP requests for our landing and login pages at a rate of ~1000/second without follow-up for the page&#x27;s resources. Attacks are happening maybe a few times a week.
 I&#x27;ve been building an IP blacklist from the points of origin, am rate-limiting these pages by IP, and have split login onto its own server, so that when these pages get flooded most of our users are not impacted. All of that has done a lot to mitigate the effects of these attacks.
 What&#x27;s the long-term game, though? Should I be concerned that we&#x27;re seeing regular attacks, or is this just a product of seeing more traffic? Are there other measures I should be taking? Can I be a better citizen of the internet by reporting points of origin to somewhere?
 Thank you so much for your thoughts on this!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been an admin for a few years now, but despite my efforts it seems like the back side of our server racks always end up a mess. When I have the time, I will go through and try and clean up cables and get everything looking nice and neat, but I find it very frustrating since it seems like I keep making shortsighted decisions that I have to fix later on. 
 I used to have a similar problem to this back when I did more development work. I would struggle with naming classes and variables, but I eventually learned that using standards and good principles helped me get past those issues. Is there some sort of equivalent for server racks? It feels like an odd question but, I&#x27;m running out of ideas here... I&#x27;m also getting tired of having to unplug a bunch of stuff before I can slide a server out for maintenance.
 To provide some context I&#x27;m mostly dealing with Poweredge servers, with a few other oneoff devices mixed in.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am posting this issue here for visibility. Early this morning, our exchange 2019 cu12 Jan SU crashed due to high CPU usage. I checked event viewer and saw two errors as the one shown below per second for 11 seconds before the server crashed. 
 An TLS 1.2 connection request was received from a remote client application, but none of the cipher suites supported by the client application are supported by the server. The TLS connection request has failed.
 Event ID 36874 Schannel source. 
 This occurred last Thursday. I am currently installing the latest SU...
 Have you experienced this issue? 
 Thanks!

 -What other documentation would be considered standard or mandatory?

 Here is the background: 
 I have about 15 workstations in my infrastructure. 
 I have a primary and a secondary active directory. 
 The FSMO roles seem to be well configured, and yet some PCs are randomly connecting to the secondary active directory. 
 ​
 I can&#x27;t figure out why this is happening and would like to force all my PCs to connect to the primary ad only.
 Do you have a solution? 
 ​
 Thanks for your help! 
 Sorry for bad english :)

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 I am just thinking about adding Rapid7 InsightIDR to my security stack. Currently, I am using Graylog, SentinelOne Complete. Additional to that, I am doing some manual scans with Greenbone.
 ​
 InsightIDR looks good, but is quite expensive for my (small) network of about 300 endpoints.
 ​
 What do you think? Are you using InsightIDR? Are you happy with it?
 ​
 Thank you for your thoughts

(which seems hard to get without signing up for a sales pitch). Any input is much appreciated; thanks, everyone!

 We are using Intune and will in many cases set up a laptop locally and ship it to the user.
 Currently the computers are just deployed with English US. But many locations need different timezones.
  
 Is there any way to automatically update the timezone and regional settings based on the location of the device? We would very much like to keep the display language in English.

                              <span>So I ran the provided script against our Exchange Online and it found several findings in the audit log at the end. Some of these findings date back to 2007. We have several findings from 2022 and 2023 as well. Are you guys running the cleanup as well? I&#x27;m having some trouble with what this all means and what the resolution path is for users that have these findings.
 The only thing from MS I&#x27;ve found is to just update the client, for users with findings are you guys resetting passwords as well? Just looking for more guidance.

We’ve noticed this since last patch cycle but hadn’t found any patch causing the issue in testing so the timing may just be a coincidence.
 Edit ; this is a VMware hosted VM

                              <span>Have a bit of a weird one and I am not sure where to start on this. 
 Users have been emailing external people and some have started coming back saying there is a PNG on the email. 
 This PNG is a blank 1x1 attachement with a file name like: 
 0e79bd18-2e8b-470a-bd12-bab865673dc1
 Ive had the same user email me and my external email address and this attachment has been missing from both the emails. 
 It looks like its present on an email that was only sent internally but un-sure if something may of been forwarded in that body and then edited out. 
 We have exclaimer which im edging towards being the problems but my knowledge with this system isn&#x27;t the greatest. Just wondering what other idea people have as to what it may be?

                              <span>So we have PingID for SSO and MFA and have our M365/Azure authenticate through it. Here recently we&#x27;ve had some key users get locked out of AD constantly. This is because the authentication requests go to our DC to authenticate each SSO authentication, and because it&#x27;s a brute force attempt, it&#x27;s constantly locking out those users. 
 I reached out on multiple occasions to PingID and they dismissed it as &quot;non issue&quot; or pointed the finger back at us. I finally got some escalation and was taken semi-seriously at pointing out this issue (exploit??) and here was there recommendation: &quot;Turn off AD lockout&quot; What? So remove a security measure to open up an even bigger risk? Let them brute force the crap out of each user until they get the correct password, then move on to the next steps? Why would we give them that ability? We&#x27;ve asked Ping to provide logs of where the attacks are coming from, IP&#x27;s, location, something. They refuse to give any. Their dashboard doesn&#x27;t provide logs because they never (yet) have made it past the first authentication factor. It only logs on second factor.
 Ping recommends buying another product (Ping Federate) to solve this issue, but has not provided any details on how that fixes the issue. We also don&#x27;t feel we should have to purchase more products from them to fix &quot;their&quot; issue.
 Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m stuck. Azure shows no logs. Purchased Azure AD P2 hoping that would help. No change in Azure AD logs. Nothing showing where the authentication attempts are coming from. Tried various geolocation and IP reputation blocks on Ping, nothing because it doesn&#x27;t block until second factor. What else could be do to stop the AD Lockouts without &quot;turning off AD Lockout&quot; as Ping carelessly suggested? Anyone else experience this with PingID, or another provider?

 I have a SQL Failover Cluster object called SQLCLS like below. I have done AD Security assessment via Purple Knight software. But I am getting a vulnerability like below.
 What should we do ?
 Description This indicator looks for computer accounts that have not rotated their passwords in the last 90 days. These passwords should be changed automatically every 30 days by default. Likelihood of Compromise Computer accounts should automatically rotate their passwords every 30 days as they are prime targets for attackers. Objects that are not doing this could show evidence of tampering. Result Found 1 computers whose password has not changed in the last 90 days.

                              <span>Okay, we have a working calling plan already setup with users being able to both receive internal and call external numbers through MS teams. I assigned this user the same license as the other people that are able to call, but this user is only able to receive external calls, it gives the error:
 Couldn&#x27;t complete the call
 With your calling license, you can only call people within your organization. Talk to your IT admin to change your license
 ​
 when the user tries to call an external number. Any advice what I should check next?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 In lights of the recent Outlook exploit that is only affecting Win11 machines / windows server 2022, I&#x27;m trying to use Intune to display all the Windows 11 machines we have.
 Within Intune &gt; Devices &gt; Windows, on the &quot;OS Version&quot; filter, everything displays &quot;10.0.1xxx&quot; or &quot;10.0.2xxx&quot; I&#x27;d have assumed that it would show &quot;11.0.0&quot; or something similar for a Win 11 machine, unless I&#x27;m mistaken?
 It might be worth noting, our current Windows 11 machines were upgraded from Windows 10, not Windows 11 out of the box.
 Appreciate the help! :) And again, apologies if I&#x27;m potentially being silly at all here.

                              <span>Finally outing myself as an idiot and saying I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing often. I know I&#x27;ll likely get ripped for this but I can&#x27;t take it anymore.
 I&#x27;m still in education for IT (tech support) and how I was taught was and is lacking. They expect people to know already the things they&#x27;re supposed to teach. The basics were taught online during the pandemic and clearly failed with me, and other things they expect folk to know as a given, but I don&#x27;t.
 My classmates had lifelong advantages and access to all manners of tech - and I never had before.
 I wish I had found a way to know more before I started my education, but even then how would I have even known where to start?
 I constantly feel stupid and I&#x27;m behind in my work immensely. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a confidence issue, or a skill issue…</span>

                              <span>What are your experiences with password manager command line tools.
 ​
 I wanted to get some long term real live usage feedback from you, since it&#x27;s hard to find not sponsored and not auto generated reviews nowadays.
 ​
 I already use a password manager for my private day to day logins, so It&#x27;s easier to remember the master pwd than all the ssh keys, and other tokens and logins. I have to switch often between systems, and to have to spin everything up is a pain, and keys/tokens in a set up script is an absolute no go. Being able to have access to all the keys from the console seems grate. 
 ​
 I use keeper as my private pwd manager and I&#x27;m happy with it, but 1password seems attractive too.
 What are your takes regarding these two?
 Maybe you all have another suggestion?
 Or another good solution? 
 My criteria:
 - simple commands and quick access to the basic functionalities (I don&#x27;t need to manage it through the console, i just want to access)
 - my sysadmin at work should be happy
 - mobile app and browser extension (if on the go or having to access smthng through the browser)

                              <span>Hi, 
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to extend the visibility of teams calendars (before judgement is passed, we are a small business and everyone is fine sharing calendars, consents are signed and filed). So we have manager&#x27;s team, where MD is the top manager and I can view all people directly reporting to him within the list of those calendars, but how do i include sub-managers team&#x27;s into it as well? 
 Also, how do i enable employee reporting to sub-manager&#x27;s to be able to view to full team as well? 
 I was hoping it was achievable through &quot;manager&#x27;s team calendar&quot; as it&#x27;s autodiscovery kind of feature without any setup for the users, rather than manually sharing or setting each mailbox to reviewer etc. 
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated, many thanks.

 I was tasked to setup a WiFI System for a business Partner in one of our buildings.
 I&#x27;m thinking of a cloud managed solution, because I would like to do all management from my office. Do you have any Recommendations which system to use?
 We are talking about 3-4 Access Points, which can be connected by wire.
 Thanks in advance!

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

 Hello All,
 ​
 Thanks for taking the time to read this post :)
 I need help. Configuring insightIDR rapid 7:
 A cloud-based SIEM built for security teams in need of a solution that can quickly detect and respond to threats in today&#x27;s ever-evolving hybrid and multi-cloud IT environments 
 The Issue: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/ldap-troubleshooting/
 For this setup im using windows 11 home edition and kali linux but for some reason i keep getting the server 91 error. I&#x27;ve tried more than 7 types of configurations scenarios - which have all failed.
 Collector won&#x27;t see or collect information through LDAP query 
 Clearly I&#x27;m missing something that i am not aware of...
 If someone can point me in the right direction i will be eternally grateful:
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey there, since I can&#x27;t find anything that works for me, I&#x27;ll try to ask here.
 I&#x27;m currently trying to configure a new Microsoft hosted mail-adress linked to our heating-system to the alarm-smtp-service, but because of its age, I guess it still uses port 465 for smtp, now I can&#x27;t find a way to send it and there is no extra slot to configure the port. Whenever I use the Powershell SMTP for testing on ports 25 and 587 it works like a charm, 465 doesn&#x27;t go through at all.
 Is there a workaround for this, or should I just use an external mail-provider for that?
 If I didn&#x27;t elaborate enough, please just tell me, maybe I can provide more info :)

                              <span>Little backstory: I&#x27;ve been working full time now for a little bit over 6 months as a developer, but I&#x27;m also a Jack of all trades on the Sysadmin part since there is no one else.
 The issue we have is that the networks IP addresses are stored in some Excel files which are :
  
Difficult to update
 A PITA to use to add any more info than the name and IP of the device
  
I&#x27;m looking for a better solution, I tried netbox but it seems to be overkill and too much tailored to DC usage which we aren&#x27;t. We do already have some of our equipements mapped using DNS names and reverse PTR in our DNS (which I also needs to migrate from a 15+ y/o server) which are monitored using zabbix. But Zabbix is only a monitoring tools, not a network mapping/inventoring one. My boss/coworker also tried at some point using Mediawiki, but the issue remains it&#x27;s a PITA to maintain.
 So, fellow sysadmins, what do you recommend to replace those old Excel files ?

                              <span>Hi admins
 I build a domain with 2 DC&#x27;s. The secondary was added trough the setup as a DC.
 Now if I&#x27;m trying to resolve from a client a server, it shows its only using the first DNS.
 But if I try NSLOOKUP &quot;HOST&quot; &quot;IP-Adress of second dns&quot; it works.
 Why is the client not using the secondary DNS? It&#x27;s all right setup on the NIC configuration
 ​
 Edit: I shut down the first DNS for testing.

 What is the best way to do this and has anyone had any issues doing this?
 Has anyone done this? Run into any troubles?

                              <span>tldr; ever said no to a job out of pure concern for the product the company offers 
 I was contacted by a company recently for a job that looks quite neat.
 As I looked into the company I found out it is a (huge) debt collection agency. If they collected debts only from companies I&#x27;d probably be fine.
 But they also collect from the normal day to day person, say some poor sod just getting behind on bills due to unfortunate circumstances ending up collection horrible interest rates and something that was a couple hundred ends up in the thousands. I&#x27;d sort of be making money from making people miserable. Call me a bleeding heart or whatever, but that&#x27;s the way it is.
 So I decided that just wouldn&#x27;t fly with me.
 I&#x27;ve worked with things that may be considered unethical as well, legal intercept amongst others, but all I ever heard were people conspiring on fraud of various kinds. I was fine with that.
 So, boiled down, I wonder if anyone else ever said no to a job due to the product the company offers?

 I’m having to take an online class for a new PaaS thing we’re getting at work, and apart from the actual content kicking my butt, the so-called teaching method is driving me nuts… I need to have two browser windows open, one with the course material and videos and one with the lab environment, and an ebook open in its own app; the course material references the book, and the book directs the labs. 
 I haven’t taken any classes in probably 15 years because I learn best by doing not trying to ingest knowledge with no application, and I’m finding the whole experience to be less than optimal; jumping between three different environments breaks concentration, videos aren’t conducive to skipping back to review info, and I don’t feel I’m learning anything. I have two big monitors on my desk, which should be enough space for all this but it still feels inefficient. 
 My boss tells me I should take more classes when (if? Lol) I complete this one, but quite frankly, if this is the new normal for online learning it sucks.

 You don&#x27;t need Intune for this either, I guess it works based on the UPNs logging into your tenant to the O365 Apps.
 You can then also go into &#x27;Servicing&#x27; &gt; &#x27;Monthly Enterprise&#x27; &gt; and roll out the latest version to a set amount of PCs (or all) and set a deadline of say 1 day to get updated. You probably would not want to do that every month, but there is flexibility.
 This may be old news, but I logged onto a dozen different clients and they did not have it turned on, so I guess not a lot of people know about it.

                              <span>I would like some recommendations on how would be a good thing for everyone. Here&#x27;s some scenario I consider : 1 week on per person with rotation each week. 
 Designed by day. Ex Monday, Tuesday #1 / Wednesday, Thursday #2 / Friday and weekend (in case of major emergency or major patch) #3
 4 off and rotate so everyone has a week off at some point.
 Half week #1 and #2 then #3 and #4
 Any other suggestions and what would be the best in your opinion? 
 Take good care guys,
 Edit because I realized some crucial information was missing.
 The production is running 24/5 but our team is working 8-5 with 1 hour lunch break abd 15 min break AM/PM. Our team don&#x27;t really need to be on premises 24/7.

 For frustrating reasons I won&#x27;t get into right now, one of my pops has run out of spare 1550 40km 10G-ER optics and I desperately need a replacement to bring up a failed backbone circuit... On a Friday night/Saturday.
 Does anyone know where I could pickup a 10G ER optic Saturday (mar 18). Or someone in the Denver area willing to make a trade?

                              <span>Hello everyone, i have a consideration of building a network for data center.. It&#x27;ll only be for IoT devices that&#x27;s related to the dc operational needs, like cctv, electrical or temp sensor, etc. There will be 5 floors, and approximately around 17 thousands of ip or endpoints will be used.
 So i&#x27;m considering using vxlan for the sake of IP efficiency and broadcast storm prevention, since there&#x27;ll be 5 floor and the switches will be put everywhere.
 Is there a best way to do the segmentation? Considering using a /17 subnet in one vlan, i&#x27;m a bit afraid of the domain failure. If I use dedicated / different vlan for each floor (by floor vlan segmentation), i can&#x27;t see the benefit of the vxlan is utilized. (And also, i think there&#x27;ll be unused ip since the allocated subnet can&#x27;t be used in different floor) If I use dedicated / different vlan for each specific IoT category, i&#x27;m considering about the dailyops, since there&#x27;ll be no thing such as ISE or ClearPass in place..
 Any advise / suggestion will be much appreciated, thank you in advance

                              <span>I got fiber installed between our units. I know, should have researched it first. The specs are as followed:
 Genspeed indoor TB riser cable
 900um tight buffered
 4 Fiber BendBright XS SMF 
 0.7/0.7/0.7 dB/km at 1310/1383/1550 nm (1383 nm uncabled)
 What sort of equipment can I use to tie this into network? I would like to use 1gbps for now and upgrade to 5g or 10g in the future if possible.
 I currently have HPE switches. I know you get SFP module I am just unsure about the exact specs needed. 
 Also should the terminations be SC or LC?

                              <span>I have a bit of an issue, and I am by no means a networking expert, so please be gentle....
 I have 11 sites, interconnected with Prisma ION-1000 SD-WAN devices. Most of the sites have 2 ISP connections. We have been using DHCP on most of the Verizon boxes we use, but have run into issues of connectivity between several of the sites. This week, they replaced the ION device at one of our locations, and we additionally asked Verizon for a static IP for the location. They assigned the IP to the wireless box and provided us with the info. As I was digging into the settings and info today, I realized that the IP they had assigned to us is the IP of the Default Gateway of one of our other devices. I remember seeing this previously, when configuring 4 other Verizon devices for distribution to locations, and thought it odd. The new device has connectivity issues, and I am unsure how to fix the problem, or if this is even possible, in this configuration? Am I missing something, or can I configure something specifically to alleviate the problem? Thank you, in advance.

 ​
 I have a strange behavior on my company network and after many hours, I can&#x27;t understand or find any logic.VLAN&#x27;s are configured on Fortigate 80F firewall (VLAN ID24 for guest network, on 10.4.24.0/24 with 10.4.24.200 GW) and I&#x27;ve tagged the VLAN ID 24 on my Netgear S3300 switch.
 When I connect through wired cable a Windows 10 laptop, everything is fine. My client received an IP from DHCP delivered by the firewall, I get my IP, gateway, mask, DNS... and I can get outside through my gateway normally
 But when I connect a laptop with a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Centos or a device with a Linux kernel), I get an IP from DHCP but I can&#x27;t go outside and I can&#x27;t ping my gateway.
 I&#x27;ve tried with 3 linux (live usb boot) differents, same behavior.
 I&#x27;ve verified the routes and eveything seems to set correctly
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 0.0.0.0; 10.4.24.200; 0.0.0.0; UG 20100 0 0 enp2s0
 10.4.24.0; 0.0.0.0; 255.255.255.0 U 100 0 0 enp2s0
 ​
 If some kind soul could help me to understand what is going on :)

                              <span>So we finally have a rack scheme draft: https://i.ibb.co/hMvWWCS/rack.png for our K12 school. Up to 700 users, 600 students, a lot of them are young. students devices 1:2., will be 1:1 in a couple years.
 Rack Allotment: https://i.ibb.co/VBQRw3X/Screenshot-39.png
 Racks are connected with 10Gb/s OM4 fiber optics cables.Asking ourselves how many routers we should plan.We thought about just one firewall router, configured in high availability mode (if one fails, the second one kicks in). So, just one router at time which will be providing both LAN routing and LAN to WAN routing.
 Assuming a VAR who specialises in networks planning, is working on this, do you see any weak points in this scheme? Any comment is highly appreciated

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Recently got into this weird issue.
 My Macbook M2 cannot seem to connect to certain private IPs using certain protocols (as stated in the title). Let&#x27;s say the private IPs are all in the range of 192.168.0.0/16, my Macbook is in 10.0.1.0/24
 - I can connect to some hosts in 192.168.12.0/24, by their open ports/listening services (say HTTPS)
 - I cannot connect to other hosts in 192.168.13.0/24, by their open ports/listening services. Even telnet to ports do not return anything (which seemed like an indicator of a firewall in between)
 - However, there are no firewalls or access lists in between my Macbook and the destinations - I confirm this since this is the network that I manage and own, and there have been no anomalies detected. No routing configuration changed.
 - I can ping/traceroute using ICMP to the hosts
 - Another colleague&#x27;s Macbook, in the same source as 10.0.1.0/24 can connect to mentioned host without problems
 - I have done tcpdump with the following commands, which return no packets if the traffic belongs to one of the affected flow (say the host I&#x27;m trying to connect to is 192.168.13.13)
 sudo tcpdump -nnvv host 192.168.13.13 0 packets captured 0 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel 
 - For a certain Window DNS server in 192.168.13.0/24, I can use it to resolve the DNS queries (via dig). I cannot, however, connect to it via RDP (while I was able to just one week ago). Tcpdump displayed DNS requests/responses, ICMP requests/replies, but no RDP traffic even coming out of the Macbook
 ​
 This has recently happened. I&#x27;m currently on Ventura 13.2.1
 ​
 Please assist me in this case. This subreddit does not allow crossposting from r/macbook, so this would be a duplicate thread :)
 ​
 P.s: I have also restarted my Macbook a few times. Not gonna work with such trick

 My manager wants to find a workaround to keep both of them working until the technician comes.

 What&#x27;s the best way to do this?

                              <span>Hi 
 I’ve been experimenting with application recognition and finding it a bit hit and miss. For example, google Remote Desktop seems cannot be recognised with 4.5.0 along with many others that are listed. In the old days anything with application awareness needed to be updated fairly regularly to stay up to date with application signatures. Is this a reason to run a pretty current software release? Not sure how good VMware SD-Wan is at application awareness but would have thought pretty good ? 
 Cheers
 Juan

                              <span>Apologies if similar cases have been asked before, but here&#x27;s the situation:
 We have IOT devices out on the field, and these devices are hooked up to modems. These modems have generic 4G SIM cards in them. The IOT devices use this public 4G connectivity to push data to an FTP server unsecurely. CTO wants to change this. CTO wants to put the FTP server behind a private subnetwork, and he wants to have the 4G SIM modems connect to a VPN with a peering to the private subnetwork with the aforementioned FTP server.
 Here&#x27;s the thing: I&#x27;m not sure how this works. The usage of 4G SIM cards means that the IP address is dynamic or keeps changing. Furthermore, the modem only supports some old L2TP/IPSEC protocol. As the CTO wants this to be on Azure, I&#x27;ve read about Azure Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site, but I don&#x27;t know how to relate this back to these modems.
 Does anyone know how this is accomplished?
 The traffic goes from public 4G to VPN Client to Azure VPN Gateway subnet to private network with the FTP server.

                              <span>So my investigations are still running.
 What I have collected so far:
  
Ubiquiti is a few steps below professional grade brands, as a whole
 Aruba series gets a lot of fans and seems to be a good overall solution
 Juniper Mist APs growing strong
 FortiXXX strong on firewalls, weaker on switching
  
This brings me to these ideas:
  
Use Fortigate for firewalling
 Use one-brand setup for switching, to keep things easier to manage
  
At this stage, I miss some thoughts about Juniper switches..... Is there any user who has an experience with these devices?

                              <span>Hi all!
 I’ve been hired as a network engineer somehow and they want to build a new DC. My boss is requesting my input on having perimeter and internal (local network facing) firewalls. However as per my understanding, the main idea of that is for the DMZ, and we don’t have any need for it currently since all of our public services are in the cloud. Is having 4 firewalls worth it in that case? Are there any other use cases?
 ISP ——&gt; Perimeter FW ——&gt; DMZ ——&gt; Internal FW ——&gt; Network 
 Right now we purchased 2 Fortigate firewalls for the perimeter, and we’re thinking of adding 2 Palo Alto FW’s.

                              <span>Hey all,
 We&#x27;re mainly Macs (managed by Mac only MDM), but have a handful of Win devices that aren&#x27;t managed atm. Normally I&#x27;d go straight to Intune, but since our org doesn&#x27;t run on M365 (Apps for biz is the highest we go), Intune isn&#x27;t the best option price wise. So looking for recommendations for other Win MDMs.
  
Hexnode looks interesting, and is cheaper than Intune.
 Scalefusion is a hard no due to their sales tactics.
 Managengine is a no due to some reviews in this sub...plus it&#x27;s more expensive than Intune.

 Even when you manually update the definitions to the latest, the older versions still show as needed in the WSUS console instead of disappearing as superseded. 
 Is there a fix for this?

                              <span>Fellow Sysadmins I need a laugh this week. I’m currently interviewing for a full time remote job. Got to the final round of a MSP and when I mentioned tech stacks they begrudgingly admitted their customers are heavy ibm legacy Java enterprise web applications users and the ticketing system is BMC remedy from 2009. 
 These systems have caused so much grief over the years I simply could not imagine working on them full time. The amount of security advisories alone can send your teams mental state to oblivion. 
 I felt bad turning them down but the hiring manager was very professional about it. Even mentioned hiring staff was becoming increasingly difficult as young or old hires are well aware these products reputation precedes them. The support teams are anemic and on a month to month biases vulnerabilities could pile higher than a dung beetle rolling shit. Anyone else have a vendor they simply won’t work anymore, with would love to hear why humorous or not.

                              <span>I’ve been working with this one client for a few years. They’re a break fix client, and I was trying to get them to approve some network improvements at one of their sites. It had an EoLed routers, switches, APs, the works. Additionally, the whole network was flat (a single subnet for their security system as well as their guest devices), and full of holes: ports 22, 80, 443, were open. They had some vulnerable VPN server running as well… it was a mess, and the whole thing needed to be overhauled, if not just dumped gasoline on. 
 Because there was a pile on of vendors who had performed work on this network over the years, there was also, of course, zero documentation. 
 When I went to segment the network, almost every device that had been installed had a static IP that was set inside of a password protected console. The job which should have taken a couple of days quickly turned into a nightmare. I had to track down ghost vendors. We had to call alarm companies. I had to get in touch with the people who installed a stupid TV remote, which only they had software to manage. After I called them, they asked why they “couldn’t access the TV remote’s management directly via the public IP address?”
 I learned to hate the static IP with a passion.
 So here’s my public service announcement: please set your damn static IPs via the router’s DHCP sever! That way they’re easier to manage if you need to move things around.

                              <span>I wrote a PowerShell script to patch our various versions of Office in one go. I figured that I would share. It may take some tweaking to work in you environment if you are using non-ProPlus versions of 2013, 2016, 2019, or 2021.
 We use Windows Update for Business with a generous Quality Update deferral period. I wrote this script with that in mind so the deferral period gets temporarily disabled. I also threw in a similar function if you are using WSUS.

 This is a game changer, and it&#x27;s a great tool to improve productivity. I wonder how much Microsoft will charge for this, and maybe they will come up with E7 and E9 licenses soon.

                              <span>So if any remember my story I was a desktop support tech that ended up being single IT person for an organization as “network administrator” with a small raise with no training hand off or help. I believe I have been trying to do the job of about 5 ppl. Initially I even stayed full nighters and work next day without sleep. There was so much demand and pretty much have been treated like garbage. There have been many crying alone days and near a complete mental breakdown. I found a new job and gave my notice and what I feared would happen is happening. They will try to bully me into a consulting deal. I gave them one and a half week notice as I had not clearance yet from new job. They’re saying I have a moral obligation to stay longer to train someone since I’m the only person that knows these systems for years. I told them I will write all documentation necessary. I know they prob asked their lawyer as a lot of legal terminology is used when talking with me so that tells me they’ve been asking their in house lawyer what are their options. They tried to promise matching salary and hiring more ppl but I don’t trust them and they’re bullies. I’m glad I didn’t tell them where I’m going as I’m starting to see their ugly character hidden thinking about ways to threaten me in one way or another. Idk how they do it as I know they’ve bullied others that have resigned into something similar. But I want nothing to do with them. I need to focus on my new job. They’re saying things will break and I leave them in a very bad position.
 Any advice is appreciated to how to handle this situation. I know once I finally say no to everything they will look for ways to threaten me or get back at me or get me in the hook w signing something that will make me liable. All advice is appreciated.

                              <span>For me AT&amp;T will always be near the top of my list. It’s like every time I want to activate a phone it’s a new kind of request they have never handled before and confuses the hell out of them. Also why is the phone call quality to the phone company always so bad? AT&amp;T Internet down? Good look using the “express ticketing” system! You need an “asset ID” to get started and as far as I can tell that information has never been provided to me. Have you ever tried navigating the AT&amp;T portal. It may as well be in an alien language. In one location we have a smaller company that resells AT&amp;T service and a network engineer answers the phone by the third ring. I highly recommend buying AT&amp;T from a company with better customer service. 
 A lot of companies just want to kick the ticket back to you by always asking for more stuff. After a week of that, we usually figure out the solution on our own, or just give up. Jamf has been irritating me by doing this lately. 
 Microsoft? They have never resolved an issue for me. I don’t even try to get help from them anymore. 
 Ring Central. My “customer success manager” doesn’t respond to my emails and has never followed through with anything they promised…not once. 
 Shout out to Meraki for being available 24/7 and their level 1 support really knows their stuff. 
 Which company has been pissing you off recently?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t mean to add to the rants here but I&#x27;ve encountered plenty in education and judicial settings.
 First off, they&#x27;re perfectly fine with telling me that an issue is my problem because &quot;IT&quot; yet nearly all of their equipment needs to involve me at some point. Microphone not working? Must be IT&#x27;s problem. Can&#x27;t pick up that person in class? IT&#x27;s problem. Then they give shitty customer service when users need help with their system. Finally, send it to their &quot;vendor&quot; who basically does everything for them. 
 Oh, you have 30k of equipment in a shitty rack not mounted to anything with NO ventilation, and yet you wonder why your BiAmp goes berserk when it&#x27;s burning itself up in the rack you spec&#x27;d, with zero space between components?
 And the arrogance... I started out remodeling auditoriums. I know the technologies they use. The issues they&#x27;re trying to solve have existed for decades.
 Yet, they never report directly to IT, they report to someone who thinks their shit is magic and they are exalted from on high.
 Does anyone have good strategies to:
 1) Hold them accountable for their work product?
 2) Understand that this is a PARTNERSHIP, not an IT vs AV fight?
 3) Help their managers understand that they are not gods
 Thanks everyone for letting me blow off some steam.

                              <span>I started with a SMB that had previously employed an MSP and now am their only and first internal IT person. The MSP used Kaseya as their RMM and gave me access to it. Now that I&#x27;m wanting to move away from the MSP, I&#x27;m working on implementing our own tools to manage our devices. We are pretty much a Microsoft shop because it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m familiar with. I&#x27;ve already enrolled all of our Windows devices in Azure/Intune and wanting to replace Kaseya. I know there are many unattended remote control solutions that would replace what I primarily use Kaseya for, but one thing I can&#x27;t seem to find without an RMM is something that gives live device inventory: what PC&#x27;s are currently on, users that are logged in, IP address of the PC, last reboot time, last agent check in time, and hardware details. Azure/Intune give some but not all of this. Most importantly I&#x27;d like to know what computers are on and connected and if anyone is logged in. I&#x27;m sure you can run custom scripts with Powershell and/or Microsoft Graph, but looking for something on a web interface. Is this possible with any of Microsoft tooling, and if not, what other solutions would provide what I&#x27;m looking for? I know RMM&#x27;s are geared towards MSP&#x27;s so simply looking for something for myself for internal use to monitor devices.

                              <span>I have several clients with Meraki Go Switches. At each office, POE dropped early this morning. Any non-poe devices are working fine, but phones/AP&#x27;s all offline.
 I am hoping this is a firmware update, and nothing malicous.
 Anyone else seeing this?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I am just looking for some advice on the best way to lock down three android tablets&#x27; chrome access, limiting it only to a few specific sites.
 For some context, they are new tablets and the client already uses 365 for their directory on their computers.
 Is the use of Intune too much here? Is there a much simpler way that I am missing?
 ​
 Thank you in advance for everyone&#x27;s comments.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am a big fan of silent software installation.
 And I&#x27;ve been told our NAV 2018 would be OK to run as a fat client, on our client pcs.
 So I want to build a silent installation script with our configuration setup.
 But I seem to be unable to find anywhere, that states the config.xml syntax for the silent installation of the software. I even tried to ask ChatGPT - which by the way, gave me the closest to something that could potentially be the correct syntax.
 Though the syntax it gave me, was two different variations. And none of them worked, after adjusting the values to fit our environment.
 ​
 So I am hoping, that someone smarter and more experienced than me, has a template or can point me in the correct direction, to get this application installed silently.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion I need some professional feedback, if I&#x27;m just lazy or come to a kinda correct conclusion. Most of our central services is already hosted by an MSP, but not this (and they don&#x27;t want to).
 So we have an alarm system to mobilize our workforce in an event. Central Server; calls a list of numbers; maybe do it again. I got this system handed over with following specs: old desktop pc; 2 LineCards for connecting to a PBX via ISDN.
 Now we came to a point, where we want to have geo-redundancy and multiple tenants. In the fist meeting we came to the conclusion it would be alright elevate the pc to a VM, connect to the PBX via VoIP (which I already planed). Create a second VM do the same, connect to a second PBX and use the build-in clustering mechanic from the software. Sounds easy enough with an second MSP which is selling the software.
 So my point is: In second thought I remembered there is a cloud solution for this software. Now I&#x27;m kinda torn between self-hosting or SaaS. SaaS, would solve my and my team lacking knowledge in PBX-tech and geo-redundancy (or at least outsource it). As the system is kinda critical, I&#x27;m questioning the reliabilty of the cloud, which would be better than right now, but if we self-host we can call the internal deskphones without external calling.
 TL;DR: would you move a critical alarmingsystem to the cloud or not?

                              <span>I am using no-ip.org for dynamic dns, with a TP-link router.
 Everything seems to work fine, router automatically changes my Ipv4 address for the domain i chose.
 I have set the port forwarding for port 80 4444 8096 and none of them is accessible over the internet, using the domain or the my IPv4 address.
 But it is accessible in my local network using domain or the ipv4 address or using internal ip obviously.
 When i turn off the port forwarding domain and ipv4 accessibility stops workings, so i thing port forwarding is working fine its just not accessible over the internet.
 Can someone please guess what may be the problem here. It would be really helpful. (I dont wanna use any more services like ngnix etc)

                              <span>I&#x27;m part of the decision making team between the two. Both will be monitoring anyway (contact company uses NinjaOne and we are deploying Intune). The main decision is regarding patch/package deployment. We will also be deploying Defender.
 To my knowledge NinjaOne doesn&#x27;t support cellphones, correct? Or tablets? Only devices that can be joined to the tenant.
 I can&#x27;t find a good comparison. Can someone educate me please?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Recently I tried to open FACEIT&#x27;s Anticheat (FACEIT is a third party matchmaking system for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) and discovered that it refuses to run unless the Process Explorer&#x27;s kernel driver PROCEXP152.SYS isn&#x27;t loaded (it is installed if Process Explorer is run at logon)
  
https://images2.imgbox.com/25/65/y3BdTtRF_o.png
 https://support.faceit.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014237259
  
After contacting them the answer I got was 
  
If the tool is prohibited which it seems it is, then FACEIT AC will not be able to run - this is 100% intentional. 
 Keep in mind in order to play on FACEIT you must comply with our technical requirements when it comes to FACEIT AC and we cannot make any adjustments based on individual concerns or issues.
  
and after asking the reason it is blocked
  
I&#x27;m afraid we will not disclose to you the reason behind this change for security and privacy reasons.
  
is there any vulnerability or weakness known for Process Explorer? It blocks the most recent version of it, 17.02

                              <span>We have a hybrid Exchange setup. Email is filtered from the Internet to our on-prem Exchange by a 3rd party email filtering service. Once email hits our internal mail servers if the recipients mailbox is in O365 the email is forwarded to O365 over a send connector. Outbound mail for on-prem users goes out through 3rd party filtering service. O365 senders mail leaves through EOP.
 I am reviewing the non-accepted domain report on the O365 Exchange admin home page and I see a large number of emails listed in this report. These emails originate from the Internet and are routed from on-prem to O365 mailboxes. I am assuming they are not being delivered but I have not heard anyone complaining yet. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the ability to dig into the results from the report. So what I have been doing is taking the domains listed there and using message trace to track emails by the domain. I don&#x27;t see anything getting blocked. Can someone explain what I am apparently missing here? Are the emails really being delivered but for some reason since it&#x27;s coming from our on-prem servers they are marked as non-accepted domains? If that is the case how do I fix it?
 Thanks in advance-

                              <span>Currently, we are using WASP and manually exporting and importing assets into FreshService. Right now API support for our inventory system is non-existent. We are looking for something to replace WASP. We looked at SolarWinds and it had autodiscovery tools for Macs but not for mobile devices which is the majority of our inventory along with Chromebooks. The API support for FS and Jamf is outdated and does not work like we want it to. It would be nice if the users and locations of our devices synced. FS does have an inventory system but we are mainly using it for Ticketing. Any ideas? Thanks!
 Edit: The way I&#x27;m hoping it will work is to have Jamf/Sccm/Google sync with the Inventory system and then sync all that information into FS through an API.

 We need to do a pentest for our ISO 27001 certification. We have contacted a company which is specialized in security/ pentesting, but we got a offer for 10.000 euro so my company wasn&#x27;t happy and said that I need to do it. The pentest should be internal and external, so I thought about scanning open ports, but further I don&#x27;t really know what I should do. Do you have some suggestions?
 Thanks!

 What do you consider best practices in a DR plan for recovery from sleeper malware?
 For example, let&#x27;s assume you have immutable backups, how long do you retain said backups for recovery? What approaches do you use to ensure the system is clean and you hit RPO with an expectation that system restores would likely come from older backups.
 What other practices and strategies do you use?

 ​
 We are running a MSP business and I&#x27;m wondering what sources do you check to keep informed about exploits / CVEs
 ​
 The past 2 weeks were insane, Veeam, fortios and outlook exploits that needed to be patched. Are there like tools or services that send emails or work with telegram to keep us informed so we can patch immediately and not like 2-3 days later.
 ​
 So I&#x27;m curious what you guys use to track this news

 We are upgrading to a Cisco 9800 Wireless Controller, we have to buy yearly DNA licenses for each access point - Is this the new thing? Do we need these licenses? It just feels like everything is a subscription now?
 Makes me angry!

 The output doesn&#x27;t actually say what it found rather who, date, subject. Many thanks

                              <span>Good morning everyone, I am writing to get information about Windows updates. Is it possible to switch from an older version of Windows 10 (let&#x27;s say 1809) to a newer one without an end of support (for example version 20H2)? I have many devices in company management on Workspace ONE and i wanted to understand if it was possible to upgrade the version. Thank you.

                              <span>Hey guys, currently setting up a phishing campaign and need some help for the networking configuration. For example I bought the URL - example.com. Internal VM is hosted at 1.1.1.1. Public IP address is 2.2.2.2. Routed 2.2.2.2 to point to example.com. The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can&#x27;t be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I&#x27;ve got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid&#x3D;516313 and to open the landing page I&#x27;ve configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2. Thanks!

                              <span>Yesterday i noticed that the local security authority protection is deactivated on my machine.
 I turned it on and rebooted the machine. 
 After rebooting, the security badge still indicates that a reboot is required and that the machine may be vulnerable. 
 Googling the issue shows multiple people having the same problem, but the blog posts i saw talking about the same problem date back to 02/23/2023.
 Is this still an ongoing issue? Is this a bug in the newest Microsoft update?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 We currently use withsecure EDR which gives us the ability to block various downloads through a browser plugin. If we decided to switch to another EDR product without this feature, is there any third party tool which can do it? It&#x27;s a shame you can&#x27;t GPO it, as the only option I can find is &quot;block dangerous downloads&quot; not &quot;Block these files..... .exe; .iso; .img;&quot;
 Thanks

 It contained a list of potential service/functionality impacting changes Microsoft is making, and the dates the changes take effect.
 For the life of me I can&#x27;t remember what it was called, who posted it, or exactly where it was posted. Hoping someone on here knows what I&#x27;m talking about and has a link to the post.
 Cheers!

 My question is: Can I safely remove all the unused Certificate Templates from AD. I need to remove the unused certificate templates without effecting our production environment.

                              <span>Hello, I have decided to go &quot;fresh&quot; and use Mailgun for a new project, but so far I&#x27;m having a terrible experience with deliverability. Things are so bad, that I get &quot;Relay access denied&quot;, when I try to even mail my own Gmail account or Domain.
 But the best part is, when I have created a ticket, they have told me first to check my DNS (I did), and next &quot;they can do nothing about it&quot;, I should contact Gmail myself.
 Let me get straight: I&#x27;m paying you money and you tell me I need to do your work and fix your deliverability issues?
 That&#x27;s not the first time we opened tickets. In the past months multiple times we have caught them being randomly flagged as spammers, or detecting &quot;unexplainable relay access denied&quot; errors in our mail.log.
 We are using exactly the same tech stack and we never saw these errors with Sendgrid.
 Is Mailgun really so bad, or I am doing something wrong?
 Honestly, at this point I&#x27;m looking for an alternative (Stripe is not an option, due to local regulation).

                              <span>Yesterday I saw a video about new Intel Xeons from Linus Tech Tips. My jaw dropped when he said they are going the chiplet route like AMD since I was afraid they will do that.
 Pretty much all of our clients use Oracle Standard 2 on Intel hardware for our product. We can&#x27;t use AMD because if licensing. Essentially if you have an AMD Epyc with four chiplets, you need FOUR CPU LICENSES. Yes, really. Which means you would need the Enterprise edition which costs more than I want to know (ranges of tens of thousands of Euros).
 Now that Intel does the same, there are multiple options.
 a) Oracle will change their licensing (highly unlikely) to allow chiplets
 b) It will not apply to the Intel implementation (it is a bit different to AMD)
 c) We start working immediately on moving our product from Oracle
 d) Our customers will need to just buy old, pre 2023 servers. This sucks because at some point supply will dry out.

 They seem not to handle their unblock requests. We reported outbound IP&#x27;s of Microsoft Exchange online many times. But they are still blocked. How is it possible that they even manage to put Microsoft 365 mail servers on a blocklist? 
 Even if they remove an IP from their list, they seem to block another one instead...
 Also you have to enter your name and company details for every lookup or removal request. This is very annoying.
 On the Website are no contact details at all. Just on the Validity website you can fond a form to enter your contact details so a sales rep can contact you. There is not even a field to enter details or a description.

                              <span>Hi, not sure if this is the right sub to ask, please point me to the right one if you know. I have to implement a speed test server with packet loss and ftp test. The argument from the client is that http is a stateless protocol but ftp is a stateful protocol and http will be hampered by the time it needs to reconnect with the server.
 I found that major browsers recently end the supports for ftp and most js ftp clients are in nodejs. So I&#x27;m wondering whether it is still possible to connect to ftp server using js. Any web technology that will be able to do that, like web workers, websocket, webRTC?
 If web technology is impossible to do, what are the other options? Thanks and really appreciate any advice.

                              <span>I am attempting to host a Windows shared drive across a StS VPN. Below is the network configuration along with IPs. I am also pretty new to this so go easy on me lol
 ​
 Site 1 - Where Shared Drive will be hosted. 
 USG Pro4 - 
 Server Address: 76.XXX.XX.XX
 Shared Remote Subnets: 10.0.5.0/24
 Remote IP 108.XX.XX.XXX
 Key Exchange Version: IKEv2
 Encryption: AES-256
 Hash: SHA1
 DH Group: 14 
 Options for PFS and Route Based VPN checked, Route distance &quot;30&quot;
 ___
 Site 2 - Needs access to Shared Drive 
 Datto DNA Appliance 
 Local Ispec ID: 108.XX.XX.XXX (Same as &quot;Remote IP&quot;)
 Remote ISpec ID: 76.XXX.XX.XX (Same as &quot;Server Address from Site-1) 
 Remote Subnets: 192.168.1.0/24
 IKE Mode: IKEv2
 Encryption Algorithm: AES-256
 Hash: SHA1
 DH Group: Group 14: 2048 bit
 (Option for &quot;Dynamic Phase 2&quot; disabled, Dead Peer Detection Enabled)
 ​
 With this current configuration I can ping the gateway of Site 2 from Site 1 but I cannot ping vice versa and I am starting to get frustrated. It&#x27;s confusing as there are multiple differences in language between the options. 
 Perhaps there is a better option?
 Any ideas would be greatly and thoroughly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I recently implemented some ties between a small number of racks in a DC using FS 24 fibre MTP polarity solution. We used all SMOF components (standardising on SMOF in the DC) consisting of: 24F Type A Cassette  24F Type A trunk cable  24F Type AF Cassette. This works and allows standard A-B patch cables on either end when patching. Essentially Port 1 maps to Port 2 on the remote cassette (rolling the fibre). However, there was a bit of confusion during installation as each A cassette had to match with an AF.
  
I understand polarity with the 3 solutions for MTP-12 (Method A, B, C). Are these exactly the same for MTP-24? 
 Could we have achieved the same result using 2x 24F Type A cassettes, and a 24F Type C trunk cable in between? 
 What are others doing for inter-rack patching in the DC - sticking with straight-through 1-1 polarity (A/A/A solution) and using A-A patch cables on one end, or using the inter-rack MTP to roll the fibre (either with a A/A/AF or A/C/A solution)?
  
I&#x27;m also looking to break out some 400G and 100G ports to 4x100G and 4x10G respectively.
 My understanding is I would use a QDD-4X100G-LR-S or QSFP-4X10G-LR-S connecting to a 3 x 8F MTP cassette (each cassette could break out 3 ports from the switch) using a MTP-12 Type A trunk cable. Is this the best way of breaking out ports to 4x standard duplex LC connectors?

 My answer was that as long as it isn’t statically assigned, the phone would follow any DHCP / Network settings of the home office environment.
 Am I missing anything here? This was raised by a young person, so, wondering if it’s a possibility a gap on their end or if I’ve missed something?

                              <span>At my company, we have two routers and two internet service providers. One is supposed to be a backup circuit while the other is our main one. Some addresses get routed out of our backup while others use our main. The reason why this is an issue is that our backup ISP is having issues and is affecting our customers. On our switch before the router we have a static address pointing to a VRF. I do know we should maybe use VRRP between the routers.

Officially, only Anyconnect SSL VPN is supported, but in theory, if the FW supports site to site VPN, it should also support IPsec VPN. Does anyone have experience with it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m running a VxLAN EVPN fabric with Cisco NX-OS 9.3(11), which has a DCI to a legacy DC (DC1) I&#x27;m migrating away from. The DCI setup uses EVPN multisite for the border-gateways in the new DC (DC2) and vanilla vPC VTEPs in DC1. I&#x27;m transitioning from a classic setup in DC1 with VRRP on the SVIs, to distributed anycast-gateway in DC2. The plan was to stitch the vlans between DCs via the border-gateways, then per vlan when half the hosts are migrated shutdown the VRRP SVI and bring up the anycast-gateway SVI.
 I&#x27;ve realised that for vlans I&#x27;ve stitched across the DCI, I can&#x27;t reach the anycast-gateway address from hosts in the legacy DC. The VTEPs in the new DC just don&#x27;t advertise EVPN routes for those interfaces. I guess this makes sense conceptually, as the anycast-gateway is intended for hosts directly connected to the leaf. However I do need some hosts in the legacy DC to route via an SVI on the border-leafs in the new DC as part of the migration process.
 As a workaround I tried spinning up an SVI with VRRP on the border-leafs in DC2, which I thought would be a valid workaround which I could then transition to anycast-gateway once the vlan was emptied from DC1. But the SVI is suspended as soon as I remove fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway from the SVI config.
 Is this a known behaviour in VxLAN EVPN with anycast-gateway, that you can&#x27;t combine a FHRP and anycast-gateway on the same leaf? Or perhaps a specific limitation with Cisco NX-OS?
 I was hoping to avoid having to extend all of the L3VPN constructs to the vPC VTEPs in DC1 as this is a manually managed DC (new DC is operated with Apstra) and this would increase the complexity.

 We are using Avocent ACS8000 Console Switch which uses Termviewer to show console connections. When trying to perform password recovery on an NX-OS by sending the break command CTRL + ] it closes the termviewer rather than sending the command through the terminal. 
 I have seen some forums suggesting sending the break command by using the options menu in the termviewer, but there is no menu for these termviewer windows inside the console switch gui&#x27;s.

                              <span>hi all 
 This might seem like a stupid question , but we have an app at work the misbehaves under some conditions but only when the latency is high. i&#x27;ve tried to set up a spot with bad wifi connection but it&#x27;s a bit hit and miss, and difficult to quantify... is there any way i could simulate this. i&#x27;m running a unifi stack on the network at work, but i have an edge router and access to a bunch of other equipment if needed , problem is i dont know where to start looking. 
 ​
 if it makes differnece the (android) device we run the app on has both wifi and Ethernet 
 ​
 Any help or hints appreciated

                              <span>I have a Cisco 3860. I have configured it so much that I have it all memorized and down to a couple minutes at this point.
 I configure the switch and everything works.
  
I add my trunk port
 I add everything to the right vlans
 I give the switch an ip address
  
And boom, internet flowing and access to everything is there!
 So I try copy running-config startup-config then reload. My configuration is gone.
 I re configure and try write memory and reoad. Then all config is gone.
 So I re config and try write mem and copy running config back to back. Every time it says it is writing the config.
 What can I look at to hopefully solve this problem? Thanks.

 Run a simulation that shows the packet capture of this occurring.
 At the exit and re-entry into the network (on the Router) create a ‘Wireshark packet capture equivalent’ using ‘simulation mode’ that uses screenshots to show the data in a technical document for senior management to use to prove that it was your targeted users MAC and IP address and explain the layered information. 
 ​
 ^the above is the information give. I just need someone to configure a network with a PC, server and router and the rest I have some idea of what to do.

 I am hoping this is a firmware update, and nothing malicous.
 Anyone else seeing this?

 I&#x27;ve tested both using netmiko_send_config or send_configs_fom_file (scrapli) both are sending the commands but not initiating the &#x27;commit&#x27;. Am I missing something obvious here? Thanks!

                              <span>Peplink routers have emerged as a leading choice for businesses and individuals alike, thanks to their innovative features, reliable performance, and user-friendly interfaces. 
 One of the most distinctive features of Peplink routers is their patented SpeedFusion technology, which enables users to combine multiple internet connections for increased speed, reliability, and security. This technology allows for bandwidth bonding, seamless failover, and intelligent load balancing across different types of internet connections, such as DSL, cable, fiber, and cellular.
 I had the opportunity to choose a Peplink Balance router for multi WAN support, load balancing and failover solution, which I liked a lot, but at that time I realised that it holds a very small market niche, and it is not very popular. Peplink might not have the same level of brand recognition as some of the more prominent players in the networking industry. This could be due to a combination of factors, including limited marketing efforts, a smaller advertising budget, or the company&#x27;s focus on niche markets. Consequently, many potential customers might not be aware of Peplink and its offerings.
 What&#x27;s your experience with Peplink, if any?

The access point is the « ruckus r320 » and only has 2 ports « poe in » which is plugged into the wall and « 12vdc » (not plugged).

                              <span>Hey guys, currently setting up a phishing campaign and need some help for the networking configuration. For example I bought the URL - example.com. Internal VM is hosted at 1.1.1.1. Public IP address is 2.2.2.2. Routed 2.2.2.2 to point to example.com. The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can&#x27;t be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I&#x27;ve got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid&#x3D;516313 and to open the landing page I&#x27;ve configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m having issue with LTE routers, losing connection and not coming up. Cisco 1100 LTE routers.
 ​
 I built a EEM script that would reload the controller if SLA icmp check status goes down.
 ​
 I think it worked last night, but I&#x27;m wondering if it would loop and trigger again if the first try would not work. If the state needs to come &#x27;up&#x27; again, in order for the script to run again. Not sure, and I would prefer it not to happen that we would again need to reboot the router manually for the connection to get back up.
 ​
 So here is the script. 
 !
 track 1 ip sla 1 reachability
 delay down 30 up 30
 !
 !
 ip sla 1
 icmp-echo 1.1.1.1 source-interface Vlan1
 ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now
 !
 !
 event manager applet Backup_Failover authorization bypass
 event track 1 state down
 action 2 cli command &quot;enable&quot;
 action 3 wait 2
 action 4 cli command &quot;conf t&quot;
 action 5 wait 2
 action 8 cli command &quot;controller cellular 0/2/0&quot;
 action 9 cli command &quot;lte radio off&quot;
 action 9.1 wait 10
 action 9.2 cli command &quot;no lte radio off&quot;
 action 9.3 cli command &quot;exit&quot;
 !
 ​
 **
 ​
 So it looks like it worked last night, but I would prefer it to rerun again if the state would not turn &#x27;up&#x27; in 5 minutes or so. Wondering if that would happen? or does it loop as long as the state is &#x27;down&#x27;?
 ​
 anyone good with eem scripting? :)

 However, I&#x27;ve been looking at our Wi-Fi, as for my apprenticeship portfolio I have to show certain things and I noticed that it was 802.11ac with 2.4GHz. Am I missing something here, please could someone explain?
 Thanks :D

                              <span>Hi guys. I&#x27;m trying to determine the best purchase option for an IDF that will house a switch that will need 5 ports to connect AV equipment to. As we only need 5 ports, I&#x27;m looking at the Cisco Catalyst 9200 Compact 12-Port PoE+ Switch | C9200CX-12P-2X2G-A switch which is fanless . I don&#x27;t know anymore about specifics i.e. exactly what AV equipment, power requirements.
 Will this suit our needs? Also, is it likely to be rackable in some way (I can&#x27;t tell)?

                              <span>I remember in the olden days there used to be something called “Small Business Server.”
 We have a very small standalone site with about 20 users where they are adamant about only having one server to manage.They don’t want to virtualize it and run separate machines as VM guests either. One server only.
 However it’s not recommended to add additional roles such as print servers to domain controllers. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment-print-spooler
 Same for file server and WSUS.
 Is there any equivalent to SBS in 2023 that’s supported for running a domain controller plus other roles on the same server?
 The only thing I can think of would be to configure direct IP printing, configure updates from Windows updates online and using SharePoint Online using a spare workstation for hosting any needed local file shares for things not hosted in SharePoint Online..
 Also, at this point, they are not interested in Azure joining workstations and getting rid of the domain.

                              <span>If you pay premium for support for faster response SLAs, and all they have to do to &quot;satisfy&quot; that SLA is send a canned response email within the allotted time (or maybe a quick clarifying question), and then screw off for several hours before actually providing support on the phone or remote session, why bother paying? Microsoft of course is the biggest offender, but lately Veeam does it too, and likely several others.
 Edit: my complaint isn&#x27;t about techs being lazy or whatever, I&#x27;m talking about the enormous gulf between marketing and support capacity

                              <span>So I have been in the IT business for the past 34 Years. Aside from society generally going off the rails lately I feel lately that I am living in the twilight zone of horrible customer support. It is just not one vendor but most. They all seem to be relying on chat support and extremely inept level 1 support people. And the quality of support is really horrible. Maybe I am getting old but there seems to be a massive sea change happening lately that is not good. It feels all wrong to be honest and makes me truly worry about the next 3-5 years. This is nothing specific about a specific vendor but just an overall feeling. 
 Maybe it is just me.

                              <span>Hey, I accidentally rebooted the hyper-v server and not the VMs … now the server is stuck on the stoping hyper-v services blue screen (all the VM were running and in prod before the reboot) I am worrying about the VMs and for the server since I’m remotely working this week. Hyper-v is installed on a poweredge.
 I guess I have to go back in the office and shut down manually the server if it’s not restarting by his own?
 That’s my first job, I’m stressed
 EDIT : IM BREATHING AGAIN, everything is online !

 From telling me to open/forward EVERY port to my pbx to telling me I don&#x27;t get a sip ACK/RINGING because u use a specific vendor as a dumb modem before my firewall. You won&#x27;t get any real awnsers, only wild guesses.
 &quot;You need to open port 20000-65000&quot; But not knowing where and why I sit here and wonder if in this field even the experts don&#x27;t know wtf is going on.

 Like wtf why must you call me my guy. Literally just jumping on to press a button. It doesn&#x27;t require a full on discussion over the phone where you&#x27;re probably going to try to talk me into installing the same printer for five other people without tickets. 
 How do you guys deal with users who insist on a call when it doesn&#x27;t make sense for one?

                              <span>As an IT Manager, I feel like I&#x27;m a &quot;jack of all trades master of none&quot;. I have about 110 users. I&#x27;m the only IT person. more than 70% of staff is remote. I do a wide array of tasks.
 I get frustrated because, for the most part, I get to spend about 15 mins thinking through something and then something else pops up. I feel like this has a negative effect on my career and my ability to focus. And I&#x27;m developing a habit of not focusing on one thing for long periods of time. I&#x27;ve had a coworker that was diagnosed with ADHD said he thought I may have it, but I&#x27;ve never investigated it more than speaking with him about it.
 Do any of you feel like you have limited time to think through something?

                              <span>We are quoting a customer to move from direct Microsoft Enterprise Agreement to our CSP/MSP. I tried posting in the MSP sub and didn&#x27;t get any replies. Today they have a line item for a product called &quot;Exchange Online P1 SU Exchange Online Kiosk Per User&quot; with SKU &quot;TRA-00065&quot;. This customer is not government and insist that Microsoft agrees this is OK for them to use. This product is confusing as they should not exist on the same line regardless. At a high level, Exchange OnLine kiosk has 2gb, EOL plan 1 has 50gb, and EOL plan 2 has 100gb. I googled and found this same product name and SKU in the wild for several government entities, such as https://www.coquitlam.ca/DocumentCenter/View/9568/23-036-RFIQ---Microsoft-Enterprise-Agreement-Renewal-and-Software-License-Management?bidId&#x3D;
 The goal of this product was to increase their F3s to have 50GB inboxes, which aligns to Exchange Online Plan 1. I am unable to compete as they are paying almost $1 for this product. Has anyone run into this before or can otherwise decode why/how kiosk and plan1 are combined into one product? Any other thoughts appreciated!

                              <span>I had a brief stint in the public sector early in my career, where 2-2.5 hour lunches were common, people actually felt like people, and work effectively stopped at 4pm on most days, if not much much earlier. Obviously, pay was not good but I reckon that the mental stability that the job overall provided was much more important. Almost everyone came from a private background too, so they knew what a golden job they had gotten. 
 The things I do in one day at my current job by myself, it was done in weeks with a team, if not months (some minor upgrades, or deployments for example). The slower pace of the job actually benefitted everyone’s mental and physical health, and people seemed happier for a fact. Anyways, I’m nearly mentally drained and I hope to get back in the public sector hopefully sooner than later

                              <span>I am trying to see if anything exists for a digital hardware acknowledgement form. From what I have found, nothing can do this. I have tried Adobe Sign but do not see a way to pull in information from either an Excel document, SharePoint list, or any other source, specifically Azure/Intune/EPM.
 Basically, I have a .csv of users and devices and I want to send out hardware acknowledgements to each of them, where they can either sign or approve. 
 I have tried Power Automate, Microsoft Word (mail merge) and now Adobe Sign to no avail. 
 Are you guys still doing paper forms, or how are you handling deploying new hardware and having users sign off on it?

 ​
 So when trying to search in a specific mailbox, when choosing the exchange location I get a preview list of &quot;100 items&quot; 
 https://i.postimg.cc/mr35fPWs/image.png
 ​
 and when I try to search for a user I get 
 &quot;0 items
 No data available&quot;
 even if it&#x27;s one that is in the first preview list of 100 users...

 Any ideas ?
 ​
 Thanks in advance !

 I know we saw some email filtering breaking a few weeks ago (source), wonder if this is another attempt by Microsoft to make a change?
 Just want to gauge with others to see if you&#x27;re also seeing a spike or if it&#x27;s just us. TIA!

 I&#x27;m relatively young in the IT space. Started my first real job around the XP end of life. It seems like every OS update, Microsoft takes away all the functional shit real IT people would use, then slowly just adds it all back over the next 2 to 3 years. Then after that it&#x27;s acceptable and that&#x27;s when I switch. Same story with 10 and 8. 
 It&#x27;s crazy this multi billion dollar company goes through the same cycle every time. Why? Just my morning shower thought.

                              <span>Currently have DUO but just now got MSFT 365 E3 licenses (we&#x27;re a bit behind).
 Anyone have any preference between the two? Our DUO pricing is very cheap as it&#x27;s part of a Cisco enterprise agreement. We&#x27;re currently federating Azure access to Duo but are considering just dropping duo out of the middle. Currently using duo for traditional MFA access fora few on-prem resources and SSO to various SaaS items

                              <span>Noticing this more and more, Barracuda setup requires a rule to essentially disable 365 filtering. Since doing this, almost all phishing attacks that 365 detects are let through - due to 3rd party filter override.
 Is there any way to only allow 365 phishing protection to continue to work via a mail flow rule or similar, with Barracuda in place? I had notifications turned on each time a phishing email was allowed by override, that&#x27;s how I found out this was happening. Barracuda doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing a very good job with these, also have their impersonation protection which also kind of sucks.

                              <span>Hello all admins
 I created a Hyper-V Cluster on Windows 2019 with a single point iSCSI Storage for my final exam. Now I have on every Clusternode NIC-Teaming with each 2 NICs activated:
 - 2 NICs for iSCSI
 - 2 NICs for Domain-Network
 - 2 NICs for the Hyper-V Cluster
 ​
 After creating the Cluster all the NICs of both nodes are in the same Cluster Network 1. Is there a way I can separate them so I can choose which functionality they should be?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I am looking for a remote control software for a vendor to use to access on of our machines. They want to be able to see the screen (which is easy) and type on the keyboard (which is hard). 
 The trick is I cannot install anything on the laptop the vendor needs access too. All solutions seem to need that agent. 
 The only glimmer I have found is Teams allows this with Edge, one day, but not yet. 
 So I am looking for any solutions you have run across that would require no agent installs, on the laptop and allow in remote access to keyboard in a pretty restrictive environment. Think DOD kind of restrictive. 
 Webex, Chrome Remote Desktop, Bomgar all are out as they require agents and installs.
 Thanks in advance![

 Everyone likes to rag on the office suite but there isn&#x27;t anything that comes close to what Microsoft&#x27;s products can do. Or do it without spending hours tweaking and configuring.
 For admin work, Powershell runs circles around other scripting languages (and this is coming from a biased Linux admin).
 I could go on for hours but now I need to go log on to my Windows 11 workstation to SSH to Linux servers all day.

                              <span>We have a windows application that is currently running on 2000+ computers and we are searching for a simple tool that could handle deployment for us.
 The machine on which the application is running is set up using ansible which works great. After the setup is completed, we install and update our application using psexec.
 Psexec is quite terrible because we have to push a new version of the application and handle problems with machines that are offline.
 I&#x27;m one of the developers of the application and we are currently trying to find a tool that would help us update the application and potentially take care of restarting it in the case of an error. I would guess that there must be many tools specifically designed for this kind of problem but I cannot find anything.
 Note that I&#x27;m not searching for a tool that can manage and install all the applications on the machine (Azure Intune, PDQDeploy). That is the job of our infrastructure team and I don&#x27;t want to invade their work.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ve been always struggling with doing on-call duty. No matter how hard I try I always get overwhelmed with alerting software and prioritization of incidents. I can&#x27;t keep my focus level consistent for the 8-9 hours duration of the shift. My ADHD definitely does not help with that either.
 Can someone recommend me some resources on becoming a better on-call engineer? How to prioritize better, how to handle incidents and not getting overwhelmed all the time with the alerts or errors thrown at me by Icinga or any other monitoring tool.
 Probably the easiest way would be to renegotiate the terms of the contract, so I wouldn&#x27;t be put in an on-call rotation, but honestly for me that feels like being not fully qualified to do my job and makes my impostor syndrome kick me even harder.
 Do you guys have any suggestions for me?

The issue with putting it in the sub CA server is that in the install instructions I found online, I need to remove the CA role and add the Online Responder role. I don&#x27;t think I should remove the CA role from the sub CA. First time setup so I appreciate any help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m walking the dog this morning thinking about how much time I waste thinking about incoming packages and where they go and if they were used and did the customer ultimately end up getting billed for the part.
 The ticketing system does not handle this well and spreadsheets are a mess. I absolutely hate using access because it is not in the cloud but it does everything I need as a single person, and in less than an hour I can go to database that will show me a dashboard of what I want to know and generate reports.
 I know there&#x27;s so many cloud options right now but every time I try something new there&#x27;s something that is not quite straight forward and takes more time to figure out and just leaning on my old trusty Microsoft Access skills. I wish I had time to learn as there are so many cool cloud tools these days, and sure if a customer is interested in a specific product I will learn everything about it and become an expert in it. In this case I&#x27;m falling back on access because I&#x27;ve already spent too much time dabbling in Microsoft Teams, messing around with building a small ticketing system within to organize tracking packages. When it comes to learning more for the sake of non-tangible endeavors it is often put on the back burner.
 And I&#x27;m not wasting time posting this because I can walk my dog and ponder at the same time.

 How to create a multi language Windows 10 image - Benno Rummens 
 This seems to have worked and my ISO states the following:
 Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool Version: 10.0.18362.1 Details for image : D:\sources\install.wim Index : 1 Name : Windows 10 Pro Description : Windows 10 Pro Size : 15.900.935.165 bytes WIM Bootable : No Architecture : x64 Hal :  Version : 10.0.19041 ServicePack Build : 2486 ServicePack Level : 0 Edition : Professional Installation : Client ProductType : WinNT ProductSuite : Terminal Server System Root : WINDOWS Directories : 31375 Files : 115933 Created : 7-1-2023 - 06:29:04 Modified : 14-3-2023 - 12:20:54 Languages : en-US (Default) nl-NL 
 The Windows installation shows the following: 
 Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool Version: 10.0.18362.1 Image Version: 10.0.18362.30 Reporting online international settings. Default system UI language : nl-NL The UI language fallback is : en-US System locale : nl-NL Default time zone : W.

Fallback Languages en-US 
 Yet when I run setup.exe the installer will tell me that the language is not the same and thus I cant keep my files and settings, am I missing something here? Does some specific language translation file need to be merged?

But in the bitlocker settings and group policy settings it&#x27;s enabled. I have had several users having this issue in my company. Am I missing something in settings? Does windows update reset the TPM?

                              <span>We recently discovered that Exchange Online transport rules, which includes mailbox forwarding configurations, forwards messages before EOP content filtering. The design decision overall makes sense, it’s just not optimal for some use cases. The end-result for forwarding to third-party systems, like Zendesk, is that messages flagged as phishing still get forwarded to the external system because the forward occurs before the content filtering by design. Some of these third-party systems have far less sophisticated content filtering that EOP.
 Short of implementing a legacy-style content filter, where you change your MX records, in front of our entire exchange environment, any ideas on how to forward messages after content filtering? We are also open to paid services as part of a solution, if there isn’t a good way to do it in the native Exchange Online platform.

                              <span>I have an issue with my Server 2019 Remote Desktop Deployment. Worked find for months... Now it doesn&#x27;t show the &quot;collections&quot;. Can&#x27;t find an error in Event Viewer and it seems like no one has ever had this happen before (and document it)! I was up until 1:30am trying to figure this out. Closest thing I found is people have this issue when the server hasn&#x27;t been added in Server Manager, but mine is listed there (and adding to a different computer same issue). I even removed, RD Services, rebooted, readded, rebooted to no avail.
 My company doesn&#x27;t offer any time-in-lieu or overtime... I&#x27;m starting to get really burned out

                              <span>Hi,
 Is anyone else seeing issues with Teams calls at the moment? We are getting a lot of reports (and I&#x27;ve seen it myself!) of audio dropping out for a few seconds while the video continues as normal.
 Microsoft haven&#x27;t issued any advisories, I can&#x27;t see any errors on our network, all updates are applied (Windows 11 22H2).
 Tearing my hair out.

                              <span>Hello experts. I realize many of you don&#x27;t use MSPs since you are sysadmins but maybe you can help me.
 I&#x27;m new to the job and in charge of the ERP side of applications and so there&#x27;s an MSP whose been here years and stays for back ups and such. I&#x27;m also responsible for them. This works since it gives me time to focus on business applications kind of thing and avoids 2am phone calls.
 The company has always bought the M365 licenses through the MSP and I&#x27;m not too cool with this. I am thinking we shouldn&#x27;t be tied to them like this. I am looking at Dell as a license reseller, they are cheaper too. Naturally the MSP has all sorts of issues with this.
 Do you all prefer to be more provider/vendor agnostic? What do you think on this topic?
 Thank you kindly.

                              <span>So Fortigate moved their licencing model from Fabric agent to the ZTNA, Though SSL still supported it now pushes the use of ZTNA, my question is, when we renew licences for EMS, will my forticlients still work? Our EMS server is on version 6.4.3 and the Forticlient Endpoints are on version 6.2.7 and 6.4.0 in our environment. We only make use of the SSL VPN feature and all we care about is getting our work from home staff continuing with their work.

                              <span>Hi
 ​
 I need to do a project for school and wanted to set up a WDS because we also need one at my company. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m completely new to this and only knew about WDS but today I saw an article about MDT and that I should use this instead of WDS for creating the imagen using WDS only for the PXE boot.
 ​
 We have many different clients ranging from Lawyers to construction companies. I wanted to create an image for every company and boot via PXE so that I only have to choose an image and then the PC should install and set up everything by itself (programs, settings, domain, pc-name, etc). The user should only log in and start working.
 ​
 My questions are:
 ​
 -is that possible?
 ​
 -what exactly are the differences between the two? Why should I use MDT over WDS?
 ​
 -what would be the best way to set that up?
 ​
 -does that work wih Windows 11 images?
 ​
 -do you know some good up-to-date articles I could use?

 With CVE-2023-23397, the attacker sends a message with an extended MAPI-property with a UNC-path to a SMB-share on the attacker-controlled server. No user interaction is required. The exploitation can be triggered as soon as the client receives the email.
 The connection to the remote SMB-server sends the user&#x27;s NTLM negotiation message, which will leak the NTLM hash of the victim to the attacker who can then relay this for authentication against other systems as the victim.
 Exploitation has been seen in the wild.
 This should be patched in the latest release but if needed, the following workarounds are available:
  
Add users to the Protected Users Security Group. This prevents the use of NTLM as an authentication mechanism. NOTE: this may cause impact to applications that require NTLM. 
 Block TCP 445/SMB outbound form your network by using a Firewall and via your VPN settings. This will prevent the sending of NTLM authentication messages to remote file shares.

                              <span>Consider a scenario where there is a pair of SANs that are replication partners with each other. Both are populated with FIPS 140-2 validated self encrypting drives so data at rest is encrypted. When one array does block level replication to the other array, does the data remain encrypted while in transit? 
 My assumption is yes since there&#x27;s no need for block level replication to understand any of the file contents in order to function. So it&#x27;s just sending 4K chunks of previously encrypted 1s and 0s over the network. 
 Can one of you experts help enlighten me?

                              <span>In recent years, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning have become increasingly important in practically every aspect of our lives. Based on these technologies, there are also promising identity and access control strategies. But what function do they truly play in identity and access management?
 The use of artificial intelligence to find anomalies in user behavior is one strategy being studied in this context. Algorithms examine user activity within a system and spot any unexpected behaviors that might point to a security problem. In this approach, possible assaults can be discovered and countered at an early stage.
 In the area of authentication, there are also interesting methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Systems that examine a user&#x27;s voice or behavior to confirm their identification are one example of this. With no further user action required, high security authentication can be accomplished in this way.
 The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in identity and access management is, however, being questioned by certain critics. One explanation for this is the possibility of faults with these technology. Users may be mistakenly blocked or unauthorized users may obtain access to secured systems as a result of a flawed system.
 How do you feel? What role do artificial intelligence and machine learning play in identity and access management? Are they a risk or a promising technology? What strategies are already in use, and where do you see room for advancement?

 https://i.imgur.com/dA6U0St.jpg
 Background: i am working for an IT company. To be able to install email app and other company related apps that are in Microsoft, I need to install this profile in my phone.
 I read the privacy fine prints before installation.
 It says, if this is company smartphone, company will know all apps I installed and has full control
 If its “personal smartphone”, which is in my case, they can only manage company-related apps that are installed thru company portal and will not have access on my photos and other apps on my phone. But they have access to the info about my phone (model, serial number etc)
 So I understood the difference, however upon checking the Manage Profile itself, which in the photo above, it seems that its more than that. It feels like i am giving the full control of my phone.
 I wanna ask network administrators here what can you really see when someone installed company portal and installed this kind of management profile on their phones.
 I understood by definition (at least the info they disclosed) the limit of what can be accessed but i would also like to know how possible it is to get all information (photos in cloud, list of all apps installed etc.) if a company network administrator will intentionally try to access everything using the management profile installed.

                              <span>good morning,
 i am studying self encrypting drives, and a functionality is to only use the dek function without an external password or Auth Key...but i am a bit confused...what is usable for security if leave only dek enabled ?
 this article says...
 https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/self-encrypting-drives
 &quot; We know what you&#x27;re thinking. If your data isn&#x27;t being fully protected, then what&#x27;s the point of even buying an SED? Does this mean that an SED can be hacked?
 Well, given that SEDs encrypt your data and store its DEK internally, you&#x27;re still being protected from common software-level attacks that seek to steal, alter, or delete your most sensitive data. &quot;
 dont get it...what protection can give me a basic dek only based sed disk?
 thank you

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin,
 I&#x27;m trying to run WordPress in a clustered setup on a 3 node Docker Swarm cluster and a MariaDB Galera cluster. However, the servers I&#x27;m using are very small and don&#x27;t have a lot of RAM/CPU.
 I&#x27;ve tried using Gluster and Ceph to sync or distribute WordPress files between the servers, but it resulted in website response times that were 10x longer. As a result, I&#x27;m currently using Syncthing to sync the mounted folder between the servers since it doesn&#x27;t impact read performance.
 I was wondering if anyone had any advice on a better way to set this up given the limited resources of the servers. Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m having an issue with some users.
 We are using Exchange Servers, and Outlook client for Windows.
 Sometimes, we have to remove users from our AD, since they are leaving the company. Our AD is synced to the Exchange Servers, and so, if the account is deleted, everything linked is deleted too.
 BUT, in the Outlook client, if someone still has the calendar from the deleted user, in his shared calendars, then Outlook will keep trying to connect to this calendar, then prompt the user for a password, and eventually not sync his Outlook anymore because it can&#x27;t load this specific removed calendar.
 Is there anyway to monitor this ? Some users have +50 loaded calendars, and finding deleted ones is kinda messy... I don&#x27;t know, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking. :)

 Does putting admins in the “protected users” group help prevent this attack?
 What other ways to prevent this attack?

 We are Hybrid 365 E5 with all best practice in place (MFA, CA policies etc). We have Mimecast in place and have worked with support to tune and harden it. We have MDO configured to Microsoft best practice as a 2nd mail security layer but with all this in place it appears that CVE-2023-23397 has exposed the fact that we should be restricting outbound SMB traffic from untrusted networks to mitigate this whilst awaiting our fleet of devices to receive the MS Office patch.
 We have been following this guide Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network - Microsoft Support however when we enable this verbatim, we find the the &#x27;override block rules&#x27; aspect of this doesn&#x27;t appear to work and our connectivity to our DC&#x27;s breaks. 
 Has anyone successfully deployed this method and are we missing an obvious &#x27;gotcha&#x27; which is catching us out.

 When i swapped in the GBooks drive to the Zbook i cleared TPM booted the drive installed drivers but im getting a TPM malfunction error when trying to login to office.
 Swapped back in the old drive and it works fine. Swapped back the drive and both laptops work fine on respective laptops. 
 What am i doing wrong? I didn&#x27;t have access to disable bitlocker on the first drive before but i do now. Is there a process for hot swapping?
 These are work laptops connect to the domain.

                              <span>This took me god damn hours to find before. I work for an MSP here. The clients environment is as follows: 
 RDS Environment: VMware Horizon 2111 Patch 19067837 
 Hypervisor: VMware ESXi 7.0.3J
 Hypervisor Management: VMware vCenter 7.0.3 Patch 19717403 
 Server Version: Windows Server 2016 (Being upgraded in the next week!)
 File Server: Windows Server 2019
 We use FSlogix profiles for the user management with profile redirection and managed Start and Desktop. 
 All holy hell broke loose when i released the update FSLogix 2210 (2.9.8361.52326), we were getting a black screen for users on logon, but as this was a managed change, we did this first in a test environment. However this consists of 15 users to ensure full testing complete. (Barring in mind they are 500+ users strong) 
 Well after much deliberation, i came across this fix through Microsoft forums! god forbid it took me 2 days after they posted it, to find it! 
 FSLogix Release Notes - FSLogix | Microsoft Learn 
 This fixed my issue with the latest update, but so you don&#x27;t have too! i thought i would throw this out there and prevent a potential disaster elsewhere! 
 The dust has now settled!!!!

                              <span>Hello there, Our whole domain infrastructure exists in Azure - virtual machine, virtual network etc. We&#x27;ve got few VPNs set up, to connect to it - one virtual gateway with few address spaces. The issue is, every few days, our local addresses lose connection to virtual network (so the domain). Tried checking basic logs on azure, but there&#x27;s nothing there. Any ideas, what could be causing the problem? Thank you.

 It is no doubt that OpenAI made a breakthrough with GPT-3 and way to go from them honestly, but I&#x27;m getting bugged from the big picture i&#x27;m seeing here, I feel like they&#x27;re hyping things up by introducing GPT-4 and the GPT language is ending up being associated with their name like they own the technology then you start hearing about GPT-5 being in developpement here and there which is like they&#x27;re trying to sell you the next iPhone, and I can&#x27;t help but recall when Microsoft tried to own the internet somehow back then. I&#x27;m all for the advance of technology but I hate when these firms start getting clearly money-driven. what do you think?

 One of the things we need for that is Pin Pads and for most of them we use the company Global Payments.
 And ho boy they have been slowly grinding me down with the amount of crap they pull with me.
 Can&#x27;t share everything, but I have probably over the past few months called them a few dozen times for issues with their garbage products and terrible service.
 Pretty sure at this point in their new trainee manuals, that if they get me on the phone they are to after the call dowse the phone in holy water and burn it, as I am the enraged Devil furious with their shit.
 So a few issues with them :
  
Their support staff don&#x27;t have email. This is one of the biggest issues and one that leaves …</span>

                              <span>Not getting much traction in the Intune subreddit
 ​
 I have 5 users out of 2000 on Full Azure AD with never ending issues. Intune isn&#x27;t Enterprise grade yet, but we are being forced to go to it due to Microsoft removing features or making legacy onprem features hard to manage going forward or not adding new features.
 The next low hanging fruit on the issue tracker is Wi-Fi.
 We have 3 Wi-Fi networks.
  
CompanyWifi
 CompanyGuest
 CompanyBYOD
  
How can I block using Intune the ability to connect or see CompanyGuest and CompanyBYOD
 In GPO I just create the profile and add the guest and BYOD to blocked list and click don&#x27;t view blocked wireless networks. I know it works because I have it right now working.
 Even with the CORP profile deployed via Intune it doesn&#x27;t automatically reconnect sometimes and they just see the CompanyNameGUEST and assume its correct. As the GUEST password is on the board room they can connect. 
 They then create support tickets saying network shares, apps and things aren&#x27;t working. The Guest and BYOD are on different VLANS and are blocked from accessing internal resources. I have told them not to connect to Guest or BYOD but ignore me. 
 We have had 25 cases so far this year just from the 5 Full Azure AD users regarding Wi-Fi and not able to access stuff and us finding they are on the wrong Wi-Fi. If we extrapolate that over 1000 odd users, we will get a shit load of tickets.
 This was such a simple thing in Group Policy but looks like moving to Intune and the Modern way is costing us more time for support and costing more money as we now need to licence everything and loosing essential features.

                              <span>Greetings gentlemen and women. I have an old machine in production that is running a UIC machine and the operating system on the computer is dos 6.2
 What is the best way to back it up so that I can see if I can get the software for the machine to run in vdos or dosbox? I don&#x27;t have an idea drive to plug in and use the backup tool in dos. Though does that back up the whole file system and os like a clone, or does it just back up the files?
 I have a star tech USB to IDE reader and have taken the drive and plugged it into win 11 hoping to use macrium and image it. To my chagrin, and what I should have realized, is I guess win 11 will not read fat16 and it says it&#x27;s a 2tb drive that needs to be initialized. Obviously that would wipe the data so that wouldn&#x27;t work.
 Tldr: Need to backup and old dos 6.2 machine and realized that win 11 wouldn&#x27;t read the data. Pls help. I&#x27;m assuming linux would do it, but am unsure how.

                              <span>There will obviously be more posts relating to American companies as the US population is 10x that of Canada.
 So for Canadian network engineers, please let me know of good companies to work for in our role. If you prefer not to say the company, the industry would be good.
 I feel like outside of the big banks and American companies with Canadian branches, it’s slim pickings for decent paying network engineering jobs. I live in Toronto but still feel this way.
 Hopefully I’m proven wrong with your stories/experiences.

                              <span>We are in the process of upgrading our perimeter from Palo Alto to Forcepoint with multiple ISP connections. In the process, we are wanting to put a bridge between the firewall and the ISP so we can take advantage of the extra IPs in a /29 or /28 if needed. I&#x27;ve recommended managed switches for these locations as many of them are automated sites with no personnel. I&#x27;m getting pushback on 2 issues. Our security consultant is recommending we put in unmanaged switches. They are cheaper, they can&#x27;t be compromised from the Internet (cue scary music) and if a redundant link goes out you just ship out another cheap switch. Secondly, if we did go with the managed switch option, he is insisting that the OOB mgmt port doesn&#x27;t plug into our trusted network but instead goes through the firewall. Apparently plugging it straight into the trusted network would immediately cause a security audit to fail. Thoughts on these 2 items?

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I have a questions regarding Cisco Anyconnect VPN and blocking certain ports / protocols out to the internet.
 Currently our VPN is full tunnel and we have ACL objects defining what systems / servers they can get to on-premise via our inside interface. How do we go about controlling what clients on the Anyconnect VPN access outbound to the internet? Is there a specific ACL i need to apply for this?

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m trying to plug a 1G/10G dual rate LR sfp+ into a 100/1000 SFP port, and it seems to work. My port comes up, but the remote 3rd party is seeing low Rx light (-35dBm) and it&#x27;s showing as down for them. Auto-neg seems to be successfull.
 My device is a Juniper SRX1500.
 I think this suggests a L1 issue so need to check patches/crossconnects, but just wanted to specifically ask if an SFP port can take a Dual-Rate SFP+ transceiver.

 I am looking to get some second opinions from you guys -- so thank you in advance! 
 We are a network with about 300 stacks and we are currently documenting what ports are patched where with spreadsheets. 
 From the research we have done, it does not seem apparent that there is a great solution to the documentation of the specifics of what is patched where, but rather focusing on identifying what device is connected, etc. 
 We are using Cisco switches. Any advice for what I could further look into, or what tools you all use, for tracking and documenting patches? 
 Thanks! -W

                              <span>We have a few grizzled, old 5400zl switches that I&#x27;d like to get premium licenses for. Problem is HP doesn&#x27;t sell them anymore. They started giving the licenses away for free with the switches the last few years they were selling them, but these were from before that time. Am I SOL or does anyone know of some way around this?

 Can I do a write erase, apply the new config, then write mem? Trying to push it out with ansible so just wanted to make sure if I do things in that order that the new config will be applied to the startup config.

I have configured split tunneling and in the ASAv conguration for the &quot;Users&quot; profile there is only 10.0.0.0/8 as &quot;secured routes&quot;. Today I checked that there are two more hosts there - DNS servers that are configured on ASAv. Can someone explain to me why they are there? Is there any way I can remove them? This is not a problem, just a cosmetic issue....

 I work for a federal facility. We are a team of 2 sr admins and 2 jr admins, with seniors being GS12 and juniors being GS11. I am a junior and as a GS11, I make right around $80k/year. I also have a CCNP and working on becoming more profecient with python and other network automation tools.
 We are coming around the end of a complete network upgrade, which included all new equipement, as well as new single mode fiber throughout the building. We went from a simple commercial network with an ASA, router, core switch, and access switches, to a new network with many devices that are new to all of us.

                              <span>Just wondering if there&#x27;s any established standard or recommendation for this? We have one building with 65 access layer switches (in 18 stacks) connecting back to one router. I think this is a bit excessive and would like to break this LAN segment down into smaller pieces.
 Am I being too conservative here, or is this a lot of switches in one segment?

                              <span>Hi
 Currently we (SP) are planning IPv6 support for our customers. Currently we are running an IPv4-only MPLS core and connecting customers using L3VPN blah. blah. After researching it seems there are 2 possible methods, either keeping it easy and keep running IPv4 core and implementing 6VPE or Dual stacking the core and run IPv6 with SRv6 while keeping IPv4 next to it. The 2nd one looks like such an headache as we do not have segment routing implemented in our IPv4 core but looks more futureproof.
 Is the 2nd option even plausible? and if it is could anyone here with some more experience in usage tell me why &quot;you&quot; would choose one over the other? Thanks!

                              <span>Here is the situation:
 Router 1  Airmax AC Rocket  Powerbeam AC  Router 2
 I need to send a Q-in-Q link between Router 1 and Router 2. I would &#x27;pack&#x27; the Q-in-Q on Router 1 and Router 2. Airmax devices would only need to transport the Q-in-Q outer VLAn without stripping the inner VLANs.
 Can they do that?
 I know for a fact that Edgeswitch devices, while they can&#x27;t pack Q-in-Q and on paper do not support Q-in-Q. However if you pack the Q-in-Q on two other devices that support Q-in-Q, a Edgeswitch will happily transport the Q-in-Q without issues.

                              <span>Hi all, long time lurker but first time posting.
 I have a Supermicro server with 24 bays and almost exactly half of the drives don&#x27;t work. From the RAID card BIOS they read as 0/00 size, and the card refuses to pass them through to the OS. I&#x27;ve even tried them in my personal rig (LSI-9750) and it spits out a &quot;Not supported&quot; error. I&#x27;ve tried the drives in 3 different servers, with 4 different RAID cards and I&#x27;m at a loss here.
 I guess I&#x27;m just looking to see if anyone has had something similar. The most I&#x27;ve found is incompatibility with 520 byte formatted drives but I&#x27;m at a loss here.
 Let me know what you all think, I can post pictures as well if needed.

                              <span>Ninite works great for approved and supported apps, but is there anything for bundling other enterprise applications that are not widely known, or are perhaps even custom, such as powershell deployments, or custom .NET apps?
 I sincerely wish Ninite Pro did this since it has a management interface for remote auditing and management support.

                              <span>So some context. I work at a university with about 200 staff and 600 students. 
 Our IT team is a helpdesk of 4, 3 system and network admins.
 We&#x27;ve got a lot of systems. On top of your basic infrastructure (AD domain controllers, wired network, wireless network, storage servers, virtualization servers, backup and replication, firewall, etc. etc.) we&#x27;re also managing, Microsoft 365 tenant (Azure AD, SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive etc. Loads of admin work with no one dedicated to looking after it all), two MDM platforms for all devices (Jamf for Mac, InTune for Windows machines, again without a dedicated person to look after it), logging and monitoring system, cyber security, and countless other systems and infra that seems to just be growing.
 What&#x27;s it like in your organization? Is there someone who&#x27;s role is to look after specific components of IT, or at least an SME for each component? For a while now it&#x27;s just felt like help desk is running around mad trying to put out fires (users who can&#x27;t connect, machines that dont have correct software, incorrect permissions, general computer issues, etc.) And then the system and network admins just get dragged into helping, meaning that any project work (and there&#x27;s a lot) is borderline impossible to devote attention to

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Good Afternoon,
 I’m hoping someone can guide me in the right direction as we’ve hit a bit of a brick wall.
 We’re using Apple Business Manager &amp; MDM (Microsoft Intune). Within Microsoft Intune we have blocked access for syncing, Apple ID’s and iCloud for regulatory reasons.
 I’ve been asked how to get contacts from an Android device onto an iPhone device, however, after looking almost everywhere it’s either a case of it needing some form of Apple ID/iCloud, it not supporting MDM devices, or it being a contact-by-contact process, which isn’t scalable.
 Does anyone have any form of alternatives?
 Kind Regards,
 Max

                              <span>I&#x27;m in it. Advice is welcome. 
 I&#x27;m moving some devices from a 3rd party print software, I&#x27;ve made the access/nat rules needed, it works for the 800 other devices I&#x27;ve pushed this to.
 The only ones that aren&#x27;t working properly are the fiber locations. I&#x27;ve tried to test from shell using 9100 and it fails. Rules are standard across the board for all 800 locations.
 Does fiber just use a different port for printing?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m out of options here, so I&#x27;d love to pick some brains from people who are wiser than me here. Has anyone else noticed the atrocious behavior of M365 Apps, specifically Outlook, on the Dell Latitude 3500&#x27;s? I&#x27;ve had anything from the application simply not opening, to it disconnecting from exchange, and other spontaneous issues. Everything stays up to date and it seems to only affect our 3500&#x27;s, not our Latitude 5000&#x27;s. The only way solutions I&#x27;ve found are rebuilding the Outlook profile, M365 repairs, and if all else fails a user profile rebuild. 
 I don&#x27;t mind doing my job and fixing these issues, but it&#x27;s getting to the point where I&#x27;m just genuinely having my time wasted with users having the same Outlook issues over and over again. Hell, I&#x27;ve even completely wiped and redeployed a machine and that same issue happened again. Microsoft has been no help and recent updates have done nothing. 
 This is such a simple tier I/II issue that I&#x27;m genuinely just getting my time wasted on. I&#x27;m tired of running a repair or rebuild every two weeks.
 So, basically, have you guys encountered this? If so, have you found any other reliable fixes?
 Also, if you think I should copy this to another sub Reddit, let me know.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had this loose thought in the back of my mind for many many years and never really looked into it as I&#x27;d come to conclusion it was overkill. But I&#x27;m trying to challenge my own assumptions and bias&#x27; more so here goes. 
 I&#x27;ve wondered if we should move the PDC FSMO role to another DC the day before we do maintenance to that server. 
 If it goes wrong you don&#x27;t have to do an AD authoritative restore, just a regular one. If it runs into issues the pressure is off to resolve them. Depending on size of forest it&#x27;s could be more than 1 day.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Had an issue last week after installing the February 2023 update (KB502289) on 4 separate devices running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 that I wanted to pass along, because I haven&#x27;t been able to find any similar issues out there.
 I believe this actually began back in October/November when we started seeing daily incidences of NETLOGON error 5719 (that we only noticed now, in hindsight). A couple of days after installing KB502289, users complained about data shares not being accessible. We noticed that the ACLs on each server weren&#x27;t listing domain members, and that led to figuring out that the secure channel/trust relationship was now broken on each of these servers.
 Tried multiple fixes including:
  
rolling back update KB502289
 Secure Channel repair
 domain unjoin/rejoin
  
None worked, and we ended up just moving the data off of the servers (as we had planned to retire them later this year anyway) and re-creating the shares. We&#x27;re still not 100% certain how this could have been remedied if we were forced to keep the servers in production.
 I&#x27;m fairly certain that this issue was caused in some part due to Netlogon protocol changes/hardening but I can&#x27;t prove it, and I&#x27;m somewhat concerned about how this could end up affecting other servers in our enterprise further down the line. I know this Netlogon hardening is considered a KABOOM so I&#x27;ve been trying to mitigate against issues, but wasn&#x27;t anticipating this one.

                              <span>Hey there,
 ​
 I am trying to figure out a good system to achieve the following design:
 ​
 I have a plethora of clients that give me VPN access to their individual sites. I would like to have my own VPN server on each site, that allows my computer to connect to each site, on demand (not an always-on system) but have it in a reverse connection fashion (so the client does not need to setup port forwarding and IP assignments on their public interface).
 ​
 I was looking into OpenVPN appliance, with a reverse connection policy.
 ​
 Has anybody had a similar scenario they needed to achieve? Thank you for any replies with help.

 I have no Azure knowledge, does anyone know how I can proceed with gaining access to the portal?

 New role: 68k, 20% travel. With multi national company with 10k employees. The role is hardware deployment and upgrades only. With limited access to ticketing system and ect.
 I&#x27;ve been in IT for 6 years + I personally feel like this taking a step backwards. There&#x27;s no room for advancement in new role unless I move out of state. It was made clear that this just hardware role.
 I barely slept, this big decision in my career.
 Thank you for your advice in advance.

 We are an MSP and I have been looking into creating a &quot;baseline&quot; script to apply to all new Office 365 tenants. Essentially, I want to create something that will increase the Security Score (so basically using the Security Score criteria as the guide for the configurations).
 I have been digging around Google, as I assume someone has already done this. However, I have come up empty handed.
 I was just wondering if anyone else has done this? If not, what is your process to ensure all of your managed Office 365 tenants are configured securely?

                              <span>that several of my job duties that i perform on a semi regular basis have actual job descriptions and are positions in and of themselves. and not only THAT, but get paid 10 to 20k more than i make currently..so im thinking maybe i should get certified that way i have a leg to stand on when i put in for these positions or demand a raise before i walk out the door. 
 so im looking on MS page and every sharepoint test i see has been discontinued, anyone know if they have an updated cert path for that? also dynamics 365? which test to search for?

                              <span>The new iPad Pro external display support is pretty neat. 
 However, it appears that the Microsoft Remote Desktop app doesn’t support full screen on the external monitor, even if I change the resolution / set it to auto / etc. 
 Has anyone found a workaround?

 EDIT We are a small team, there&#x27;s just myself and the network admin and we are already stretched thin. Trying to tackle this has us both ready to down a bottle of Jack during the work day.
 After purchasing we find out that the quote we got to replace our UTM FULL GUARD doesn&#x27;t contain the email protection so that&#x27;s another 10k we have to pull from budget.
 1) You can&#x27;t just take your config and transfer it, you have to send it to Sophos and they will run some type of voodoo magic to make it compatible. But not all of it.
 2) You have to rebuild all of your firewall r…</span>

The reality is that they don&#x27;t want to carry a laptop to and from the office so they leave a laptop at home where it never goes online to get application and security updates. Their defense is that they don&#x27;t want employees leaving them in cars on days they don&#x27;t go straight home. They all have Bitlocker enabled and we live in Virginia, it doesn&#x27;t get that hot to melt the laptop. How do you guys handle this?

At my current job we have all of the back end stuff working for bitlocker but have to manually enable bitlocker. 
 Does anyone know how to set up this user experience where bitlocker is enabled and to the user they are prompted to create their password? I wasn&#x27;t involved with the development at my old place so am not familiar with what to do. Thanks!

 I’ve got an absolute shoestring budget, and limited external support. We were donated 2 physical servers : totally blank.
 I’m trying to implement the absolute simplest and cheapest solution turn these to vm hosts.
 I was thinking either ESXi or CentOS w/ something like VMware workstation or oracle box.
 I&#x27;d love to hear thoughts and alternatives!

Whichever browser the user does not use, receives the updates but will scan as being out of date until the browser is launched. I have been looking for policy settings I can use to force the application to update even if not launched but I cannot find anything. Does anyone know how to achieve this?

Now we have requirement to collect dnsdist snmp info as agentx and forward data to main snmp on server, but issue is how we it is gonna end up? like there will be same oid with different infos. Is there any convinient way to handle it without seperating hosts on nagios?

                              <span>Hello, I am in the midst of migrating to a new dfs file server, and during testing I have been able to migrate my documents and pictures folders etc, and they migrate over. However the Desktop will not redirect and is remaining in the old location. I have verified the old policy does not apply, and is not enforced. The OU I am in is a test OU with inheritance blocked as well. When I run gpresult /v I see that other folder redirects are listed, but there is none for the Desktop. Is there something I am missing?

                              <span>First exposure to recruiters from abroad:
 Approached by a recruiter based in the UK, who found me on a business related social media site. 
 Agreed to talk about the offer: company/role/wage etc. Company is local to me (not UK)
 After our talk he sen&#x27;t me an e-mail wanting me to reply by copy-pasting a text he appended:
 &quot;I, {my name} confirm that {recruiter name} of {recruiter company} has discussed the role of {job title} at {company they want to refer me to} and confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative.
 I understand {recruiter company} are passing my basic details and CV to {company they want to refer me to} on my behalf and are doing so with my express agreement. The Data Privacy and Retention Policy of {company they want to refer me to} is available from {link to company they want to refer me to} {company they want to refer me to}.&quot;
 ​
  
The &quot;confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative&quot; + no time limit for how long is fishy to me. If it were only for the company he&#x27;s selling me to, I wouldn&#x27;t really mind though.
 But is it really meant that way? What if I don&#x27;t accept the role? Would I need to terminate the contract with him/them being my sole representative?
 The link goes to the homepage of {company they want to refer me to}, where I couldn&#x27;t find the Data Retention Policy. I can understand why they need to refer to the {company they want to refer me to}&#x27;s Data Retention policy, since they send my CV over, but wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to link to the {recruiter company} Data Privacy and Retention Policy? Or both?
  
Is this BS? Am I being overly cautious? 
 Thank you

 How do people keep records/create logs for any changes made within IT?
 Is there an open source bit of software that can be used or anything?
 Cheers

 One time I was asked to resolve every event log error in the windows server estate
 Now I Laugh about how futile that was and wondered who had come up with the idea and why my time could not have been spent in a more useful way, I guess I was a very cheap resource 😂

                              <span>Hi everyone. We have a request from a client to find a solution that does BOTH patch management (Microsoft patches but also 3rd party apps patches) and vulnerability scanning for about 500 pcs. So far the only thing that I could find that does these things is Languard, but after a few days of testing the trial I&#x27;m not confident to recommend this. It&#x27;s very slow, freezes a lot, agent deployment does not work 99% of the time, looks very dated, etc.
 I really liked Rapid 7&#x27;s Insight VM for vulnerability assessment but this doesn&#x27;t do patch management and the client doesn&#x27;t want 2 sepparate apps... There&#x27;s also Qualys that would work and I like it, but they have huge prices, it&#x27;s enterprise level solution.
 So, in a nutshell, do you know of any solution that can do what I need and doesn&#x27;t cost my weight in gold? 
 Thank you!

 As someone who is not experienced with AD, if we set a rule that denies users/computers from changing their domain or reverting to a workgroup. is it possible to move these users to a different domain if all of our domain controllers fail?

 Have you seen this before?
 Maybe a problem on the adminsdholder, since I have another alert concerning it? (I tried to reset the permissions on the adminsdholder, without success).
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi! I recently noticed that in Windows 11 start menu, folders are only shown when there are at least two items in the folder. If you have a folder that you have added to %appdata%\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs And the folder only have 1 item, the item will be shown ”normal” in the startmenu. However, the folder will still be shown in %appdata%\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs 
 Is there any register value to change the ”minimum item in start menu folder”?

                              <span>I have a customer who is getting an error saying their Roaming profile is only partially synced when they log in. Two users have reported. They are onsite, connected directly to the network. Upto date Windows 10 installs. The domain was originally an SBS, then migrated, currently on 2019 std. Any tips on this?

 Does anyone have experience with this tool or ever heard of it?

 ​
 I discovered Z-push a while ago, in every documentation I find it talks about integration with Zimbra. 
 ​
 In my case I have a server with Directadmin and exim with more than 10k mail accounts running and I would like to know if it can be integrated with my system without having to migrate everything to Zimbra.
 ​
 I also have a CalDav and CardDav server running, so I understand that it could be configured for z-push to use both servers.
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey guys, really stuck here. We use different gens of Surface Devices in our domain, mainly Book 2 and Surface Pro 7/8 - since approx. January people complain about not beeing able to share their screen. This only happens solely on Surface pro 7. You plug in the usb dongle, click the .exe on the usb share but nothing happens.
 Funny sidenote: it works with all guest devices, it works with our lenovo notebooks, it works with surface book 2, only about 30 Surface Pro 7 dont work.
 We use CS-100 and CS-200 and appropiate Clickshare Buttons, all on the latest firmware.Windows Version is 20H2, soon 22H2 on all machines, also no GPO that prevents USB since it works on all other devices. We are really struggling atm - no eventlog nor barco log show problems. We tried deleting local profiles, we downgraded firmware...
 Does anyone experience the same?

 They were doing a reply all and it was blocked by our mail security so I allowed their domain to relay which helped but now it is blocked by their own mail security as it is mail to themselves originating from an IP that does not belong to them. I guess they can allow our IP to send mail as them? but is there a better way to do this? I feel we should not be bypassing security and making exceptions.

                              <span>Looking for some tips and advice and maybe others are sturgling with the same problem.
 All our users have a laptop with always on vpn. We split tunnel some stuff like teams/onedrive to not kill our internet connection. Normal web traffic goes trough the vpn and firewall rules.
 Lately we are detecting large amount of traffic from alot of windows 10 laptops to some ip bloks. Mostly 8.238.22.x, 8.238.23.x, 8.238.177.x, 8.238.179.x and 152.199.21.x ranges. It show as port 80 webtraffic and they are big data blocks and causes our internet connection to clog up. Also we are europe based and the ip blocks seem to be from usa. (nsa stop spying!!! :p ) We can kill it with firewall rules but we need to get to the source of this.
 Stuf we tried/considerd.
  
It all started pretty much at the same time and only are win10 laptops.
 Checked if we missed ip block update from microsoft but that is not the case.
 Tried to find something about the ip&#x27;s but can not find anything more than Level 3 communications.
 Ran malware bytes on laptops confirmed they had this problem and nothing found
 When a range is blocked at some point the laptop stops trying to connect.
  
Anny and all tips would be very welcome. At the moment I am trying to get my hands on a laptop that showing this so i can try to see if I can get the proces with netstat but at the moment no luck.

                              <span>So for the longest time I have been terrible at linking a title with something - this goes for anything, examples such as:
 - Names for people
 - Titles for subjects
 - Area names like street names, site areas, ect...
 I am generally quite intelligent and managed to get by with this limitation as although I struggle with the titles, the knowledge I pick up quite quickly. However, as an IT apprentice this has been effecting me more and more, especially for my portfolio.
 For my portfolio I have to fill out a KSB table (Knowledge Skills and Behaviours) where I have met each topic, e.g. applying the appropriate skills/techniques for secure working. Every time I go to look at it I feel a little overwhelmed and not sure where to start due to this weakness. 
 Moreover, when providing on site support, as I am first/second line support, it can be difficult for me knowing where things are. Although I know where users are as I have learned their names after being there a while, if someone says one of the clock in machines isn&#x27;t working I have to get them to describe where rather than just saying the area name.
 I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure where on reddit to ask this, so if there is a better place please advise me :) However, I thought this would be a good place as my issues are effecting my ability in my career and I am sure someone else has likely experienced this.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 So I&#x27;m looking into an issue with a few surface pro 9s where the on screen keyboard doesn&#x27;t auto appear even when there&#x27;s no typercover or keyboard attached. It doesn&#x27;t even seem to detect tablet mode. I&#x27;ve tried playing about with all the settings that should enable the touch keyboard but don&#x27;t know what else to try. 
 ​
 Has anyone had this issue before and managed to fix it? The machines were built with SCCM so maybe it could be an issue with the image, GPOs or something in the task sequence.

 I can manually input a mobile number into AzureAD, even though the field should be greyed out. I thought ActiveDirectory had lost authority over AzureAD but our MSP has said there&#x27;s a &quot;Microsoft bug&quot;. Anyone else aware of this?

                              <span>we are running a proof of concept on Microsoft teams through a Citrix VDI environment using the teams machine wide installer that installs in c program files that seems to lack features over the full version. Citrix hdx optimized is working and we are on the latest version.
 we are experiencing intermittent issues with users getting kicked out of calls, webcam quality poor or not working, no noise cancellation so can hear dogs barking and keyboards. 
 Going to be hard getting people to want to use this as the last 3 years they have been using a well known cloud based video conferencing tool features like noise cancellation however we are paying for e3 e5 office 365 licences and suspect that is our path forward
 Just wondering if anyone else has been in the same position, fielding why is teams so crap through citrix questions etc and has any advice, feedback, suggestions. If you have been in this position what was the outcome?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on AD DS machine. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 My question is : Has anyone had any problems after changing this hardening?
 thanks,
 ​
 Vulnerability :
 ​
 Description 
 ​
 When non-privileged users can link GPOs at the Domain Controllers OU level, they havetheability to effect change on domain controllers as well as potentially elevate access and change domain-wide security posture. This indicator looks for non-default principals who have write permissions on the GPLink attribute or Write DACL/Write Owner on the object. Likelihood of Compromise Just being able to link GPOs doesn&#x27;t provide the whole picture. An attacker would need to find or edit a GPO that contains the instructions they want to achieve. However, i fan attacker can find an existing GPO that meets their needs, then having this write permission gives them thekeys to the kingdom. Result Found 1 objects with write permissions on the GPLink attributeat the Domain Controller OU level. OU&#x3D;Domain Controllers CONTOSO\Enterprise Key Admins Allow: Generic All on: All Properties DC&#x3D;contoso,DC&#x3D;local Allow: Generic All on: All Properties contoso\Enterprise Key Admins

                              <span>It is my understanding that if I install the 2023-02 Security Monthly Rollup patch or the 2023-02 Cumulative Updates, the fixes that were released on 2022-01 is also applied as part of the patch.
 Now I have a 2012 R2 server in which the patch level is at 2023-02 rollup patch. I thought that if I try to install the 2022-01 monthly rollup patch, it will give an error that says &quot;update not applicable&quot; since a latest monthly rollup patch is already installed - but for some reason it did not and I was still able to install the old patch.
 ​
 Would there be any changes in terms of security by installing a much older patch? I now wonder what changes would there be by installing an older patch?

                              <span>Hey folks, I’m one of the devs behind Netdata, a free tool that lets you keep an eye on your servers and apps. I wrote a blog post about how to monitor Windows Server like a pro, what to look out for, what to measure and so on. It’s based on my own experience and some research I did. Here’s the link: https://www.netdata.cloud/windows-monitoring/ 
 ​
 I’d really appreciate your feedback on the post and the tool. Do you think it covers all the bases for Windows Server monitoring? What are some of the headaches or issues you run into when dealing with Windows servers? What would make Netdata more awesome for you and other users? I’m not trying to sell or spam anything here. I just want to learn from your insights and suggestions so that I can improve Netdata for you and others. Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts.

 ​
 I&#x27;ve got my SC-200 this Friday, previously attempted it and failed by 1 or 2 marks, I got 684 and needed 700 :(
 ​
 Work gave me a 2nd exam voucher and I realised we also have access to measure-up for free so I&#x27;ve been going through the 117 Qs they have but am I better using exam dumps? Measure-up offer money back guarantees if you can hit 90% in succession (confident I can do this easily with practice) but would I be better spending my time on the exam dumps instead? 
 For dumps my colleague recommended Prof-IT (work subsidised buying this so I have access to both options).
 Overall I find Measure-up better personally in terms of interaction/gui/features.
 ​
 Any thoughts welcome.

                              <span>Hi 
 We are a small MSP who seem to run into problems, when we are experiencing more complicated issues with our customers&#x27; different copiers. These are issues that seems to relate to their drivers and the interaction with the rest of the network/print server ecosystem. 
 Our experience when contacting the different Copier/Printer suppliers is mostly rejections saying that the issue is with our systems - e.g. once we had a technician connect a laptop directly to the ethernet port on a copier, print a page and conclude that there was not a problem printing to their device. While I can understand the technician&#x27;s point of view, in regards to his domain with technical support of the copier itself, I am guessing it is fairly few organizations who buy a copier for one person to connect directly to it via ethernet cable.
 Other times they will say we can only use one specific driver without further explanation, even though their own company supplies both Universal and PCL and PS variants.
 We try of course to be diligent in our testing and problem solving, but when we cannot find fault in our systems, we need somebody to turn to. It seems it is very hard to get the suppliers of Copiers/Printers to take what seems to be issues with their drivers and the interaction with other IT systems seriously?
 So I am asking for advice on how you handle issues with copiers, where you have tested different configurations in regards to network, server setup and drivers with no luck
  
Do you buy special support from the copier/printer manufacturers?
 Do you have a secret hotline?
 Any other tips?
  
Thank you!

 I&#x27;ve never seen this particular pop up before, only when changing default browser, never when deleting the chrome icon.
 Anyone else seen this?

                              <span>Hej,
 is it possible to have following setup: 
 serverA with
 Roundcube
 ManagedSieve plugin by Dovecot / Pigeonhole 
 serverB with
 Mailboxes
 Postfix 
 All postboxes are on serverB, unfortunalty they can be migrated yet to other system and on serverB no webmail is possible. So I would like to use serverA with rounducbe, IMAP&amp;SMTP connections are working fine but also I want to use the filter options in rounducbe, so a managedSieve is needed. Can I set it up on the local roundcube?
 So e.g. the local Sieve in manageing the filter option if set up in roundcube, like thunderbird would do it? 
 Currently I just get a timeout or couldn&#x27;t connect to managedSieve server and I wonder if this is even possible or not.

                              <span>My organization is entirely on-premise (AD, ADFS, domain clients).
 ​
 As I understand, it is entirely possible to configure on-premise only WHFB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-cert-trust-adfs
 ​
 My question is -
  
Once I enable ADFS as the CRA, and configure DNS for device registration - who/which devices will be prompted to register?
 Can I allow/enforce registration only for domain-joined devices, and all other devices will just authenticate as usual without using WHFB?
  
​
 I&#x27;m trying to &#x27;allow&#x27; WHFB in my organization, but not to &#x27;enforce it&#x27;.
 Because not everyone who will authenticate against my ADFS are using a domain-joined laptop.
 We want to allow WFHB for domain-joined corporate devices, while those logging in from their personal devices (non-domain joined or even joined to someone else&#x27;s AAD) are not prompted to register (since the registration would fail, as we are on-prem only).
 ​
 i.e. if you try to access https://intranet from a domain device, you are prompted to register/use WHFB
 if you try to access https://intranet from a personal non-domain device, you are not prompted to register and can just use &#x27;regular login&#x27;

                              <span>Hi, I have some users that are local admins on their laptops and some that are not. Does anybody know if it makes a difference when installing Admin by request, if the end user is a local admin or not? Does the software still work the same in either case or should I make all users either standard or local admin first before installing?
 EDIT: I have just thought why my question does make sense
 I was told to install the software onto my domain laptops in a kind of monitoring mode before enabling &#x27;Require Approval &#x3D; ON&#x27;, but if that then makes all my standard users local admins this is not good.
 So, if Admin by request is installed on to a stanadrd users account and I then leave it in moniotor mode, which is,
 Allow run as admin &#x3D; on
 Require Approval &#x3D; off
 Does this kind of make all standard users local admin users until approval is enabled?

                              <span>im looking primarily for what specs/protocols I need to get a switch to push a vlan to an ip phone/by oui and or be able to have the phones second port(switch port) be on a different vlan.
 back story: I inherited a situation with about 40 Polycom vvx-501 and tds managed ip hosting. They have two cisco 2960xs and a cisco router.
 we own the phones and are looking to move to a new provider. Our budget is tight and the ceo hates spending on networking. I noticed if we let the new provider lease us switches we end up paying $4200 over 5 years for two Extreme networks 210-24 port units that we dont get to keep at the end.
 for that price I figured we might as well get an aruba instant on 1960 48 port poe version. Then eventually another 48 port non poe. then I can roll out some of the POE thin…</span>

                              <span>Hello folks, my company plan to purchase almost 1000 Access Points and controllers for our distributed network. We prefer on prem products for controllers. As APs we don’t think its a good time to switch to WiFi 6E so we prefer WiFi 6. We are Cisco shop but there is a problem with their shipment date, 400 days last time i asked them. Also they are not giving much discount even with a big purchase. So we look into other vendors like Aruba, Extreme and Huawei. So for those who worked with multiple of those vendors how do you compare them?

I have configured a small topology in EVE-NG, basically I have a Cisco Router configured as PKI Server, it can deliver certificates to other routers and cisco ASAv, but when I enter Fortigate GUI and go to certificates, CA &gt; SCEP and I enter the server url which is http://1.1.1.1 (Loopback interface for the cisco router) and I get an error. Even if I try to generate a CSR for the same url, it creates my certificate and it appears in the local certificates list but it&#x27;s not validated.
 Should I just go for another SCEP solution? Isn&#x27;t the cisco router capable of sending certificates to Fortigate firewalls?

 We currently use Lumen, formerly CenturyLink. Our experience with them has never been sticker worthy and it continues to worsen. We would like to start moving a different direction but I would like to see recommendations from others.
 Who do you use, or have used in the past, that was actually great to deal with. It actually wouldn&#x27;t hurt to know which companies to stay away from as well.

                              <span>I have two Cisco routers configured the same with the same server. For some reason one of the routers has no packets coming in or out. It&#x27;s not communicating with the server at all. Everything between both routers are the same, just one does not want to work. I have checked if anything is different between the two, but there&#x27;s nothing different in the SNMP config. The server is pingable. Anyone have any idea what would be causing no packets to go in/out.

                              <span>Wondering if I am over reacting or not. One of my employees has been using dual nics to connect to the WAN and our management network at the same time. Is this as risky as I think it is. Are we basically connecting our management network to the open internet? Or is this normal to do?

                              <span>I am having trouble with a laptop wireless connection to an Epson projector. Originally, both the laptop and projector were connected to the office network over the same ssid at the main router. The projector is assigned a static IP address, which allows the laptop to connect to it over the router. However, something is causing a huge amount of lag in the connection. The router appears to be working fine for all other devices, however for the projector connection there is tremendous lag at times. My solution for this was to purchase a wireless access point. So now I am trying to connect the projector to the network through the access point (with a different ssid) while the laptop remains on the main ssid. In this configuration the laptop cannot find the projector. The projector successfully connects to the network with its static IP, however on the laptop side it can’t be found. I thought that as long as the projector IP remained the same, it would not matter how the projector connects to the network for it to communicate with the laptop. What am I missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m noticing reach-ability to 4.2.2.3 has significant packet loss, starting around 3/12, anyone else notice the same. Its one of 2 locations we use for verifying internet connectivity, other destinations aren&#x27;t seeing similar issues. Doesn&#x27;t appear i can attach a log but its clean and available (more or less forever) and started consistently having issues up/down losses with aprox 16-17% packet losses. Edit - 4.2.2.3.
 ​
 Also just to provide clarity we test with 1 ICMP per 60 seconds, nothing terribly overwhelming, I wouldn&#x27;t imagine we&#x27;d hit any kind of DDOS threshold.

I tried to make a dynamic route between the devices&#x27; fiber ports but somehow it wont work. Logs are flapping between exchange and down and the reason is too many transmissions. I searched in the internet and the solution I only find is MTU mismatch or MTU misconfig. I tried to fix this problem but the adjacency still doesnt form and logs are still flapping between exchange and down. What do you think is the reason behind this? This is my first time handling inter-vendor routing. Thank you.

                              <span>I am about to use Eve NG with the Windows Server either 2019 or 2022.
 I have a i9 13900KS 24 Cores.
 I will upgrade it to 128 GB of RAM.
 I have about 3 TB of a external SATA I want to use.
 As far as RAM and processing power, to have a enterprise environment running with switches , routers, firewall and clients. That should be more than enough RAM to push through?
 I know it depends on how large the environment is , but realistically just to have enough power for run at least a moderate enterprise environment with the listed above?

                              <span>Given the following scenario: 
 -VLAN 100 with a DHCP scope with 8h lease time
 -VLAN 200 with a DHCP scope with 8h lease time
 -Accesspoint in bridge mode with ~ 30 clients on a switch port with untagged VLAN 100
 ​
 -&gt; The AP is putting clients in the VLAN 100 where they get a DHCP address. So far so good.
 -&gt; When I change the vlan to VLAN 200 untagged on the switch port, all clients immediatly ask for a new DHCP address and get an address in the VLAN 200 DHCP scope. 
 -&gt; My questions are: Why is this the case? The lease time is 8 hours, so shouldn&#x27;t the clients at least keep the address for 4h before asking for a new one? Or has this something to do with the clients not being able to reach their gateway in VLAN 100 anymore and therefore asking for a new address?

 Can someone help with configuring Extreme AP410 via the cli. I need to configure wi-fi with authorization indication using WPA Enterprise specifying AAA radius. And also please explain how you can configure the vlan for a specific ssid. For example, I want the ssid &quot;test_vlan_100&quot; to be accessed in vlan 100.

 Thanks for any help.

                              <span>I have been working in IT for well over a decade, almost all of it being help desk. My current role is a mid-tier system engineer role for almost a year. Most of what I do is user account management, a little data center support, exchange 2010, shared drive access management, airwatch/WS1, and some other light system duties. I am very interested in endpoint engineering with O365, Intune, SCCM, Exchange Online, and Azure.
 I have done some work in O365 and Intune from a help desk role a couple jobs ago. My current company will be migrating to O365 later this year, with me being part of the migration.
 A friend recommended a powershell book and I started building scripts for some exchange tasks.
 I haven&#x27;t used SCCM itself, I used KACE and Empirum. I reached out to one of the engineers to show me SCCM and she&#x27;s going to let me shadow her for software packaging and pushes.
 Besides just shadowing others, what are some resources I can watch, learn, and do myself to get a jump start? My job has plenty of downtime and I want to fill that time to learn more things.

                              <span>I am splitting up my flat network into 3 zones, A, B and C all with a firewall in between. Zone A will house ICS, Zone B will house servers and Zone C will house users. Currently I have 2 domain controllers that mirror each other on the flat network. A handful of users will need to authenticate across all 3 zones.
 What should I do with the domain controller to keep it secure. Should I keep it in the user zone and place read-only DCs in the other zones? Should I keep it the servers zone and setup DCs in the 2 other zones with one-way trusts? Should I setup stand alone DCs in all 3 zones and create those user accounts accounts the 3 DCs? My paranoia is that if my one DC gets compromised then users can&#x27;t log into the 3 zones. My ICS zone needs to be the most secure.

 I have used it very sparingly - basically finding a script online and just changing the options.
 Basically starting at zero.

                              <span>Hi,
 i work in IT support of a Company with around 4500 employees - the default Smartphones we hand out are Samsung A53s 5G.
 So recently an employee left the company and we got a like-new A53 with Android 13 back to hand out to the next user.
 He did a factory reset but didnt remove his google account - so we cant access the device. Even a factory reset via recovery mode doesnt help. The phone always ask&#x27;s for the last registered google acc.
 Does anyone of you have an idea how to bypass Samsung&#x27;s FRP? I would prefer solutions without sussy external software.
 I saw some youtube videos how a guy accessed bixby with talkback (Android 12). Via bixby you can access some stuff like browser or settings... but it seems like this has been fixed with Android 13 - i at least could not make it work.
 Thanks for your ideas/solutions!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for input of anyone who has used a vendor to come in and teach an IT department how to handle users with better customer service. 
 I have inherited a group that truly &#x27;means well, however their soft skills are sub par. They are receptive to self improvement. I would like to find someone to teach my guys some methods to provide the best support possible.
 The positions of this team are all over the board... literally the entire IT department. 
 All suggestions, opinions, feedback are welcomed. Thanks!

                              <span>Left my SysAdmin job last year for burnout. A colleague who went on to become CTO of an ecomm company reached out in Feb to check in on me and see if I was open to some contract work. 
 I’m sick of spending my savings so I said yes. 
 Essentially, they fired their old head of ops because of a massive crash around Valentine’s Day. 
 The CTO wants me to come in and basically rebuild the department in the image of the company where we worked at together. 
 There’s 2 other junior IT people I’ll have at my disposal who I will be training up. 
 If everything goes good, there’s the potential to stay on or if I don’t want to, the pay will allow me to take some more time off. 
 Any tips on scoping this out and making good? Mistakes to avoid?

 I work for software company that has multiple software products. Each team that works with each product is kind of like their own company, in a way. Anyhow, a large corporation recently acquired about 5/8 of these software products and all of the employees working with these software products have all had to join this corporation. The rest of the company stayed behind. One of these individuals who worked for the part of the company that got acquired was our sysadmin. He had been the system admin for several years and by the looks of it, documented nothing. There are no procedures, processes or anything anywhere. Nothing. The server room is a disaster, no cable management, a ball of cables the size of a small vehicle in the middle of the room and a huge disintegrating b…</span>

 However I also noticed that the website is gone and can no longer be accessed. Would this be related to the SPF record and A record change as well?

 I wanted to see if any of you have a policy that handles employees replacing or providing compensation for damaging company hardware. So, we have two accidental damages that are out of warranty. We are a fairly new non-profit. No purposeful or constant damage has occurred. I was asked by HR to find out and create a policy for it. We are located in Little Rock, AR, USA

                              <span>We want to change our krbtgt Password that has pwdlastset attribut from 2001(!).
 Our domain Forrest Level ist W2016 and we dont have any old XP or 2003 Clients. There are no AD Trusts that have to be considered. 
 This is the klist output:
 Client: user @ domain
 Server: krbtgt/domain@ domain
 KerbTicket: RSADSI RC4-HMAC(NT)
 From my understanding of the kerberos and the pwd change process, nothing can go wrong here (except if i change the password rapidly two times in a row).
 But is there anything I need to consider when changing such an old krbtgt Password with RC4 Ticket encryption still in place?

                              <span>I like where I work generally and I am in the top 5% for wages in my area. For protection I am not going to name positions but lets just say our &quot;Director of IT&quot; has been making life hard for IT in general. Doesn&#x27;t want SNMP or other types of monitoring as &quot;The IT staff should be doing that every day&quot;, we must make tickets for issues ourselves because &quot;It would make IT look unfriendly to have the company submit tickets&quot;, Cant use password managers like Keeper or OnePassword because &quot;that would be too controlling&quot; for the staff, can&#x27;t bring the company under one brand of computer because &quot;it is simpler to let workers use what works best for them&quot;
 ​
 The list keeps going on and on. It feels like he does not know how IT works or is just actively working against IT. We can&#x27;t have him removed because the owner thinks he walks on water and s**** roses.

                              <span>I got laid off at the begin of the month. 
 I got a coupe in person interviews setup. 
 Last time I interviewed was 5 years ago. 
 Should I be wearing a suit to the interviews or is that over kill now?

 ​
 Does anyone know how to create a KQL alert for when a user is having 2 MFA app Authentication Methods configured? By default we have 1 app MFA method and Phone SMS setup, but if a user setup app MFA method for lets say a tablet, or another phone, then we want to have an alert on it.
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 I have two domains and need nothing but registration and DNS from my registrar.
 Besides the incessant nagging, I do remember there were DNS issues, but I cannot definitively recall what they were... I think some problem with quad records and some limitation with A records for subdomains.
 Any recommendations for the best alternative? Again, I don&#x27;t need any hosting/email/marketing/junk.

We were dealing with an issue where an off brand software that we don&#x27;t support failed for one of our higher ups and we were tasked with fixing it. I did what I could, contacting the devs for assistance and failing. My co worker managed to pull it off doing the same thing I did. It&#x27;s very confusing to me and I feel like I don&#x27;t know how it managed to succeeed where I failed so many times. I can&#x27;t even tell if there&#x27;s anyone else in the same boat as me. It&#x27;s confusing and a bit disheartening.

                              <span>We have a few Windows Server VMs on-prem. All of them except for our DNS/DHCP server are not super critical. Even if our DNS/DHCP server was compromised or died, we have a back up of the configs that we could just throw on a new Windows server instance. Most other VMs mainly just serve as app servers for facilities, or jump boxes for ScreenConnect. We run Veeam backups, but they&#x27;re not being off-sited. They could go down and people could still do their jobs, but we&#x27;d still have to rebuild things for them.
 If we were ever compromised, the org would not really be heavily affected, but we&#x27;d probably spend quite a bit of time setting new things back up. My question, is should we invest the money and time into making sure we have off-site backups if the information is not super critical? Or are things more critical than I really think?

                              <span>So i’m working as IT support and in this new company i’ve never had experience to troubleshoot Mac, fuck, i’ve never seen in my country that someone using Mac. 
 So, its not that hard to be Mac administrator but here is a problem that i saw first time today. I had to wipe one laptop and to install a new MacOS and for some reason even after wiping and cleaning HD they are still asking me to put Apple ID which is weird because i don’t have it ( guy left company ) and even after erasing Mac it’s still asking me to put apple ID. 
 My HR department sent him e-mail but i doubt he will tell us his password so my question is what should i do next ? If i try to reinstall MacOS from USB stick, will i still have same problem ?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Another long time lurker, fist time poster. Sorry for languange (not my first language) and if i missed community.
 So, my company is IT company, dealing primary in software developement. We are part of companys that are privaty held by one person. No compay helds share of other company, one person is phisical owner of all companys. Also owners wish is that our compay deals with all IT related problem.
 So the problem is, that people from this companys are freaquenty working in some other company ( in this group of companys) and bringing their PC&#x27;s around, making a mess with licence tracking. It is not realistic, that when a person is tasked to work at other company for a period of time, his PC will be sold to this company and then (after he is finished) soled back to primary company again.
 So our idea is, that my company (IT) would own all the PC&#x27;s and server, and leasing it to other companys. We can easly track where some PC is (majoraty of month), and invoiced the proper compay for monthy usage of this PC. But i cannot get the information if this kind of bussines model is legal from Microsoft Windows OS stand point? We would like to do the same with servers (Win Srv 2019 Datacenter for hosts and Standard for WMs).
 Can we buy PCs and laptops with OEM Win PRO licence and lease them to other companys?
 Thank you for pointing me in right direction, i will gladly provide additional information. And off course leagal and financial teams will be involved before pulling the trigger on the decision.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m looking for a recommendation for a product that folks have used and are happy with. I think ultimately we&#x27;d like a single product for endpoint security, but that may not be possible. 
 The most pressing issue is endpoint content filtering and https decryption. We need to be able to control URLs per-user or per-user group, and when we enable certain URLs (office365 for example) we need to re-write http headers to allow login only to certain tenants (similar to this KB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions ) However, we&#x27;re going to want to control this for more and more cloud providers (adobe cloud, google workspaces, aws, etc) and each has a slightly different way they want the http header re-written to be able to lock down which users can login. 
 The above is my most pressing need right now, and cisco umbrella can do this when using the more advanced flavors of the product and the cisco AnyConnect agent on the endpoint, however it&#x27;s limited to like 6 cloud providers at the moment, and not flexible. 
 So please let me know if you have a product you are happy with that can do the above. Now ideally this product would also replace our AV/Firewall/EDR as well, but that&#x27;s sort of a secondary goal. 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello there, 
 how can i give our front desk the permission to adjust the bookings (from other colleeagues!) in our room ressources?
 She already has full access to the rooms and can delete the bookings just fine.
 But she can&#x27;t adjust the times. They are greyed out in the scheduling assistant. She also can&#x27;t invite other persons.
 As far as i know they were able to do that in Exchange on Prem. At least they told me that they were.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Good Morning Sysadmins,
 I am a bit unfamiliar and i am looking for more experienced sys admins personal experiences. Last week I created a few new subnets via the meraki dashboard and deployed the corrresponding firewalls accordingly. (In the past I&#x27;ve only worked with subnets that have already existed.
 Is there anything else I can do to prep network after creating new subnets. Ex dhcp/dns server settings? 
 Thank you

Maybe I&#x27;m just blowing this out of water but is this overreach? Could this be a potential security hazard? 
 What&#x27;re typical policies on sharing IT policies with the general public?

                              <span>How would you approach in terms to data backup with given scenario: 
 - All the data is stored on a Synology NAS 70TB capacity
 - There are 50TB of data and 4 million files
 - There is an unused old/outdated Isilon cluster with 289TB available
 - Not all data has the same criticality and many of them files are GigaBite sized could points or HD video. Loads of photos too 
 To me the easiest way would be to use Hyper Backup on synology to Isilon but when configuring it says &quot;no modules available&quot; and given Isilon is on a very much outdated version and this cannot be reverted (rsync 2.6.9 version) I would love to hear any ideas and create a nice discussion topic

                              <span>Our small company has recently suffered the tragic untimely loss of a much loved member of staff. My question is, what do we do with the mailbox now? What is the accepted &#x27;protocol&#x27;? Do we redirect and issue an auto-reply saying the employee is deceased? Do we say nothing?? When an employee leaves under normal circumstances their mailbox is archived and their email address is added as an alias to someone else&#x27;s mailbox who picks up any emails.
 What do you do? We don&#x27;t have a HR dept to ask.

Also I only control the UK side. My boss was asking me should we still be using skykick. I have no control over this application at all and tbh have no idea what it does or what it&#x27;s for. Could someone give me a quick rundown on what it is and if it&#x27;s something you think we should still be paying for. Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 I have been working as an IT-apprentice now for 1.5 years (my first job in IT ever). I have mostly done first line support for the company, this including installing new PCs, setting up new users, printers, phones, meeting rooms etc.
 In about a month there will be a subject test for me to get a certificate of apprenticeship.
 I just recieved what the last two apprentices had to do and I have no idea how to do this stuff as I have not done this type of stuff before, ever.
 In short what I have to do:
 &quot;Set up a new IT-system for a school/business.&quot;
 - Three servers: two Domain Controllers and one Fileserver
 - Install two clients with windows and configurating them
 - IP range/segment (?)
 - Set up and configurate: AD, DNS, DHCP, Print and Document Services, Shares, Public and personal space.
 - Set up GPO for public and private
 - I also need to set up a switch, wich the two clients and printer will be connected to.
 The servers will be virtual (VMware)
 I have googled, but not sure what Im looking for.
 Im not asking for a full guide, but rather a nodge in the right direction. 
 This test will be over five days, I will also need to plan, document and evaluate my own work before presenting it.

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I&#x27;m setting up some systems for the first time so I wanted to check best practices and security before implementation. I&#x27;m working for a SMB, the time has come to replace our old fileserver which contains over 20TB of files over the past several years. Currently, this file server&#x27;s a windows server with multiple SMB shares on for pretty much all work across the business. 
 ​
 A new Dell ME5 Powervault has been set up running RAID10 with a single large LUN &amp; volume. I have several queries on the best practice and configuration having only really worked with small setups single hosts, local storage etc. I&#x27;d like to ensure this is done properly.
 ​
 1) Should I just attach the Powervault on iSCSI using windows iSCSI Connect on a VM, then place the NTFS files direct on here? Or would a large VHDX be better for any reason e.g. performance, security, backup then mount this to Hyper-V? Or even multiple smaller VHDX&#x27;s due to the size? 
 2) Security wise without too much impact on performance what is best e.g. CHAPS, Full disk encryption on the PowerVault, separate VLAN between the Powervault and Hypervisor? This would be done using a core switch, I don&#x27;t have separate hardware I could use for isolation. 
 3) Is robocopy still the best method using MIR or /XO and ran before and after cut-off of the old server shares?
 4) Any other advise on best practices and security?

                              <span>Hi guys
 I want that domain users can restart a specific service. I was able to set the permission with sc.exe.
 So far so good. But with this settings the user is also able to just stop the service, what I dont want. So I want to deploy a cmd script, instead of advising the users to do something in services. So the users can just double click the cmd script and the service will restart.
 Even though I granted the access for the user to restart the service (it works in services), the access with cmd (net stop &amp;&amp; net start) is not granted. Is there a possibility?
 Best regards

                              <span>I have been using the same Logitech M-U0007 mouse &amp; MS ergo keyboard (the one with the weird bump) for like 3-4 years and I love them. Other coworkers seem to dislike my keyboard though :(
 Lately i&#x27;ve been having some performance issues with my mouse and it looks like the sensor is dying.
 I would like to know what my fellow Sysadmins use. Do you use regular company provided KB and mouse set or do you supply your own?
 I&#x27;m treating it like recommendations and i&#x27;m interested in the different kind of hardware.
 My hands are quite large (I know, I know) and I prefer an ergonomic design with side buttons.

                              <span>Hey All,
 Having an odd issue, we have half a dozen staff using Macs for creative work and over 40 staff on windows devices. The windows devices have 0 issues with the SMB V3 share. Our macs also seem to work fine, i&#x27;m able to download and upload large files fairly quickly no issue.
 The problem we&#x27;re having is InDesign saving to our servers SMB share. A 15MB InDesign file with a few images linked takes 40 seconds to save both when opened from the server and saved back or worked from a local source and saved to the server. I can copy a few GB from the same device to the server in less time with finder. If saved locally InDesign saves instantly. If copied and pasted from the macs local drive to the server it&#x27;s also instant. InDesign feels like it just spins for 35s before trying to create a file.
 Has anyone else experienced this? We&#x27;re using InDesign 18.1 on a 2017 iMac running Monterey 12.3.1 and a 2020 iMac also running the same OS and InDesign version. I&#x27;ve tried earlier versions back to 17.0 with the same issue still occurring.

                              <span>I have been working in IT for 10 years, started as a sysadmin and spent the past 5 years as a DevOps engineer. In each company I&#x27;ve worked for, I&#x27;ve faced the challenge of managing tedious requests from developers, like restoring databases after they&#x27;ve broken them or granting access to databases for investigating bugs, creating new repositories, adding users to it, service restarts, redeployment requests etc...
 Sometimes, it can be overwhelming and tiring to manage these tasks. I&#x27;m curious to know if other DevOps/system engineers feel the same way. Do you also find this part of your job to be frustrating and tedious, that you try to avoid it and start procrastinating?

                              <span>Good morning.
 I want to configure an Ubuntu VM with SAMBA to create a shared folder.
 We currently use AD in my organization.
 Is there any recommendation to do it in the best way?
 I am referring to the security issue.
 Can I use CLAMAV to live scan the shared folder?
 The VM with Ubuntu, would only be used to create that share.
 Greetings and thanks in advance.

 Is it possible to create a windows bootable from a vm? It would save us a lot of work reinstalling tools and migrating licenses.
 Thanks for any tips!

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I am going to struggle to articulate what I&#x27;m looking to achieve here because I&#x27;m not sure how I go about this. 
 We currently have a suite of software delivered by a third party application - kind of like adobe creative cloud but for engineering.
 Now we had a policy change that means we no longer allow any user to be a local admin group member on any client endpoint. We instead use LAPS for the odd occasion when admin right sis needed.
 Before this policy change, the software suite was run via a service whose user was in every local admin group on all user endpoints, so this service no longer works and we&#x27;re struggling to use other methods such as intune due to the size of the applications etc.
 So I guess what my question is, how do I make a service have the ability to run things as an administrator in the users login? 
 The applications we install are all based on a network share and currently I run the application as the local (LAPS) administrator and then pass user credentials to access the share. Very clumsy. The alternative I have setup for now is a script that deploys via intune its mounts a drive as system using hardcoded user credentials in the script to mount the share as a drive then manually running a shortcut for the executable (this is hit and miss). 
 My assumption is to run the service as system, but I don&#x27;t think that this would be able to access network shares and also be able to interact with the user session for the install.
 Apologies if this is not very clear.

What are the different job descriptions/options, what&#x27;s the difference day-to-day, and can you rank how shitty or not they are in terms of work-life balance and general vibes / the wanting-to-roblox-scale?

 I just connected new domain controller DC2 (2022 server), the dhcp service has been left on the DC1 (2012 r2) server, The problem is that no dynamic client updates appear in the dns of the DC2 server. When I run dcdiag there are no errors. Is it normal behavior that dynamic client updates appear only on this server where DHCP service is running, or should it be synchronized to all DC/DNS servers?

                              <span>So I got a non-standard request that I haven&#x27;t encountered before.
 A client has a company-issued laptop that will be used by remote/outsourced staff based overseas and as consequence of that, they&#x27;d like this laptop to be prevented from joining public WiFi networks but to still be able to join any WiFi networks that are considered either home or corporate networks.
 This a Windows 10 laptop joined to an Azure AD domain.
 I&#x27;m unsure of any built-in method in Windows that can achieve this and the client&#x27;s current AV solution also doesn&#x27;t have this functionality built into it (Webroot Endpoint).
 I know you can block a Windows device from joining specific SSIDs but Windows only determines a network is public/private/domain AFTER joining it via NLA, so on a technical level I don&#x27;t see how the OS would know that particular network is &quot;public&quot; before being joined to it and therefore know that it&#x27;s not allowed to join it?
 Is this something that you&#x27;d only be able to implement via 3rd-party software?
 Are there any Azure AD-based security policies that could achieve this?

We&#x27;re financially secure on just my income, but I&#x27;m thinking of working a second part-time IT related gig for additional income. We&#x27;ve been making great progress towards buying our first home in our HCoL area, and I would like to continue saving or at least not dip into our savings if possible. Anyone working 10-20 hours per week on a side gig or just a part time primary job? Thanks!

                              <span>I am working with some huge datasets (journal entries from our ERP) and we have had performance issues connecting the TXT files directly to PowerBI in the past. I’d like to load the data to a database first and then connect to PowerBI via SQL to improve performance.
 My background is more in visualization so I have not had to set up a database before. Are there any recommendations on databases that take into account learning curve for a newbie? There may be some data transformation involved as well but that can be done in PowerBI.
 I was thinking of SQL Server but wanted to get some opinions. Thanks!!

As part of the onboarding process, i&#x27;ve been tasked with figuring out some &quot;baseline&quot; searches and queries to save that would be useful. 
 What are some of the most useful &quot;canned&quot; or custom queries / search functions you&#x27;ve utilized, that you couldn&#x27;t do without? 
 As an example, in Tanium for instance it might be useful to get all workstations that need a reboot. For this, the query would be: 
 &quot;Get Reboot Required from all machines&quot; 
 What are some examples of some &quot;go to&quot; scripts, queries etc that you use frequently? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>We are in the process of migrating to Windows Server 2022 for our custom remote app and have found issue where the application loses focus and problems with the published apps border.
 We&#x27;ve tried several resolutions including adjusting to classic theme, remote FX, RDP bitmap settings etc, without a resolution.
 The focus issue appears to be specifically related to the version of mstsc on the local computer as the focus issue occur on older versions on Windows.
 Just wondering if anyone else has had issues and found a fix?

                              <span>As the new network engineer for a certain company, I have inherited some...less than stellar network design choices. Regarding TACACS, I have had to make due with what&#x27;s available until new equipment arrives. In the interim, I am trying to do some AAA implementation and getting hung up on a specific set of commands I&#x27;d like to restrict if possible.
 I am trying to restrict the Tier 1 techs in a way that allows them to manipulate a VLAN&#x27;s tagged/untagged ports, but there are other commands under &quot;vlan&quot; I&#x27;d like for them to not be able to access. So, to add a port to, say VLAN 10, as untagged it would look like this:
 switch(config)# vlan 10 untagged ethernet 16 
 The problem is, it seems that I can only either allow no access to the &quot;vlan&quot; command tree or allow all. I say that because I do not know and have not been able to find a way to tell TACACS to allow the user access to the list of VLANs (since they are user defined) or the port number. I&#x27;ve tried using an asterisk after the &quot;vlan&quot; entry like so:
 vlan * untagged ethernet * 
 And other variations of this, but nothing has seemed to work. If anyone has any advice I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it, I would prefer not to have to give them access to the whole &quot;vlan&quot; command tree.

The issue is that I feel like there is a possibility that these IP addresses can be compressed to their optimum CIDR equivalent. Also, there is IPv6 addresses in there as well.
  104.44.41.24/30 104.44.41.32/32 104.44.41.34/31 104.44.41.36/30 104.44.41.130/31 104.44.41.132/30 ... 
 I am not sure what would be the best way to approach this. If I write something from scratch, I am absolutely confident that it will be terrible. So, I am hoping that someone smarter than me has already figured out this problem.

                              <span>Hello!
 We are troubleshooting packet loss issues at a office location. Essentially I am working with an MSP. When I arrived today colasoft ping tool showed a 10% packet loss out of around 2000 packets. Troubleshooting showed that the loss was only occurring with traffic north of the firewall, the next hop is provider equipment. 
 Some notes about the configuration: - the firewall (watchguard firebox T80) has a static public address on the WAN interface - the provider router (technicolor, not really familiar) is supposed to be in bridge mode and claim that is the case
 The problem currently; - when the provider router reboots, things seem fine but gradually packet loss percentage begins to climb over the course of the day - when I run traceroutes, I see the provider router as a hop. When I…</span>

 I&#x27;ve tried every method I can think of, but I cannot get these certs to work.
 I have a very simple setup:
 Cloudflare DNS (Proxied) Subdomain (sub.domain.tld) &gt; Web Server&#x27;s Public IP Address &gt; Cisco ASA with port forwarding on 80 and 443 to internal web server &gt; Windows Server 2022 running IIS 10.
 I can hit IIS on HTTP/80 but nothing I do will allow me to get an HTTPS connection.
 On web browser clients outside of my network, I get &quot;Invalid SSL Certificate Error 526&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve tried both &quot;Full&quot; and &quot;Full (Strict)&quot; SSL modes, I&#x27;ve tried revoking and reissuing the certificate, I&#x27;ve tried including and excluding the wildcard and root domain along with the subdomain I want to secure, I&#x27;ve tried usin…</span>

                              <span>The remote dc is connected to us through a fiber ring (ospf) from our core to a MRV but from the outside the public IPs are say 100.1.1..0/24 . We have a year to move our stuff back on-prem. Currently we&#x27;re working on updating our own public IPs (from 2 ISPs) into a BGP set up (2 routers). Is there a way we can configure the BGP to make migrating our services back easier? like including the 100.1.1.x network in the bgp mix? Or should i treat these as two separate projects?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to learn and implement a network management tool to cover Calix E7 Shelves that contain EXA and AXOS network cards. My department is mostly interested in Zabbix since its open source, but I have heard that there are better tools out there such as SolarWinds and LogicMonitor. I am also concerned because from an compliance standpoint, Zabbix is internationally headquartered. As an ISP, is it safe/reasonable to implement a foreign, open-source network management tool?
 On that note, does anyone have any experience with a tool that would allow for automation, security monitoring, and data logging for an ISP network? As we may move away from Calix equipment in the future, interoperability and accessibility are important.

This prompts a text interface menu &quot;Manager Mode&quot; where I have to select an option like 1. Status and Counters... 2. Switch Configuration... 3. Console Passwords... 4. Event log 5.

 Is there a way to SSH in directly to the CLI? I guess my google-fu is lacking

                              <span>Hello, we have a relatively complicated network setup that I have tried draw below to help explain. Currently we have two campuses linked together by a Siklu Etherhaul Wireless device (spec&#x27;d at 1gbps but really we get around 600mbps). We are a few days away from commissioning a new leased fibre circuit(using Openreach here in the UK) at 1gbps. We use this kind of site to site link in several location and we will be getting the full 1gbps throughput. I want to be in a position where by default, the switches will use the more reliable and higher bandwidth fibre link, not the WiFi.
 My concern is that by default, spanning tree will look at the two options for routing the traffic, see that they are both technically advertised as 1000mbps and just decide to use the WiFi.
 Can anyone advise how I can forcefully set the fibre link as the default in SPT?

                              <span>Previous ISP installed a microtik router that allowed us to use multiple ports for our different static IP addresses. 
 New ISP has given us a modem with a single hand off. Would the solution here be to install a dumb switch after the ISP modem and plug in our 2 separate firewalls to the switch and assign static IPs?
 2 firewalls, yes I know. One is for a 2nd company that needs traffic as separate as possible from the other.

                              <span>So I have a question on how acceptable this is. I have a property where all of the inner vlan routing is done at the firewall level, the level of communication between vlans is relatively small and it has never been an issue.
 ​
 We recently installed a new security camera system and I am looking to relieve the new traffic now moving through the firewall from the camera to employee VLANs. My initial thoughts were to add IPs and a static route on our L3 core switch (that we currently do not use for any routing) and change the gateway for the camera vlan to point to the switch. I would keep the gateway of the employee vlan to the firewall, but the L3 switch would also be in the subnet sending the video feeds from the camera vlan, I was also planning on setting up the switch ACLs so just the camera ports are allowed through the switch.
 ​
 Does that sound reasonable? I could also change the DHCP scope for the employee vlan to the core and set the default route to the firewall on the switch, but the traffic to the camera vlan from employee is pretty minimal.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve just finished my CCNP Enterprise, but I&#x27;d really like to take it one step further and get a CCIE. I&#x27;ve been learning from the official Cisco courses for the ENCOR and ENARSI exam (from cisco learning networks store), but unfortunately there is no single course there, that would prepare me for the CCIE EI lab. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on what course/courses to take over the next few months/years to prepare for the lab?
 I&#x27;m thinking about starting the official course for the ENSDWI. That would probably prepare me for the SD-WAN part, because although I have some experience with it, but to learn how to set it up from 0 it totally different from just operating it and making some changes to it.
 Unfortunately at my company we don&#x27;t have any clients, that would use Cisco SD Access, so I&#x27;m also looking for a place, where I can at least do some labs with the Cisco DNA Center. Also a bit more some BGP and MPLS practice wouldn&#x27;t hurt, but I think that can be simulated by GNS3 or some other network sim.
 Do you have any preffered courses? What did help you to earn CCIE (or how are you preparing for CCIE)?
 Thanks

                              <span>We had some emergency funding for this during the pandemic and then it fizzled out as people transitioned back to working onsite. Suddenly the org is now hiring and shifting to hiring remote only workers for a significant number of users. Technical remote support in my experience has been very involved. This seems like a good time for administrative meetings to discuss a support structure, funding and more Human Resources to support this. Is anyone else experiencing this? What are you doing?

                              <span>So - I was recently voluntold to help get a new network implemented for a nonprofit I help out at. Sure! I forgot how much i forgot however, it’s been a hot minute. Hoping you all can help get me on the right path.
 Setup: all 1G managed switches, Some connected by copper some by fiber/SFPs. Low low client count (under 100). There’s also a cable company provided gateway/router which spits out 192.168.0.x DHCP addresses internally. They also pay for two static IPs 10.x.x.x that currently go to some standalone ubiquiti server that routes them and handles the wifi internet access point traffic currently. The idea is to retire all that soonish. Keep if we must.
 All i wanted to do was set up this new network of switches i mentioned above on its own subnet (192.168.2.x) and everything on that subnet would be static IPs - and connect it at one place on ine switch with (i had assumed) A static route so anything not .2.x would get pushed to the cable company gateway/router and to the outside world. The .2.x subnet is for a POE camera system for them so thats why i was thinking keep it separate.. flawed? There’s also wifi 6 access points they want to add later for internet connectivity, and retire the old ubiquiti setup.
 Is this the right idea? Or should i swap over everything to be on the .0.x subnet? Should i leave everything on DHCP?
 Thanks..

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have some issues with the networking thought you may have the same experience or you could help.
 We are running QEMU/KVM on Dual Epyc servers (256 logical core) with Mellanox dual 40G connections. When our customers were pushing more than 50k pps and a few hundred mbps starts to drop the VM&#x27;s packets. However, the server load and the network load are very low almost nothing.
 We were start tune the network and the Kernel of the host as AMD/Intel recommended to see how it goes. Started using Vhost and multi-queues but now we are seeing a heavy load on the CPU from the Vhost/network which is higher than 70% of the CPU time with only a small number of VM&#x27;s on these servers. Around 60VM&#x27;s with low usage on CPU and 500Mbit (110k pps) on the network. The two Epyc 7h12 with 256 logical cores are pushing around 80 percent of the CPU and more than 60 percent of it is from the network/vhost. Now we don&#x27;t have packet drops but under a heavy CPU load.
 Here are the configurations and changes we made.
 We have started with this 3 months ago
 -netdev tap,id&#x3D;nic0,ifname&#x3D;$TAPIF,script&#x3D;no,downscript&#x3D;no,vhost&#x3D;on,queues&#x3D;8 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev&#x3D;nic0,mq&#x3D;on,vectors&#x3D;10,mac&#x3D;$MAC 
 Still had packet loss.
 Latest config. High CPU load but no packet drops.
 -netdev tap,id&#x3D;nic0,ifname&#x3D;$TAPIF,script&#x3D;no,downscript&#x3D;no,vhost&#x3D;on,queues&#x3D;2,poll-us&#x3D;50000 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev&#x3D;nic0,mq&#x3D;on,vectors&#x3D;10,rx_queue_size&#x3D;1024,tx_queue_size&#x3D;1024,packed&#x3D;on,mac&#x3D;$MAC 
 This is how we create a network interface
 ip tuntap add $TAPIF mode tap user $َUSERNAME multi_queue
 Any idea?
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a large fiber project and I&#x27;m curious as to what type of transceivers I need. We have fiber switches ina central location sending data to homes. In most all cases, we put a media converter on the home end and connect an ethernet cable to their router. But rarely I will need to connect to an sfp port on a router. What are the requirements for the tranceivers? I need a downstream on the switch end and upstream on the router end? Do the brands need to be the same? Do bi-directional transceivers work on either end? Please forgive my ignorance on any terms I&#x27;m using here. Advice appreciated.

                              <span>I think, from the network operator perspective, the Remote Monitoring feature (RMON) is just adding new MIBs to SNMP MIBs and it helps to monitor network statistics for better network visibility.
 What can I use instead of RMON to have good network visibility? Sflow or something similar could be a good alternative, ya? What would you suggest to replace with RMON?
 Apart from that, A sound box with REST API support or NETCONF support, could give the network operator what RMON provides, right?

                              <span>Pardon if this is not allowed though not sure where to post.
 Have to post on a throwaway as I have colleagues here that frequent the subreddit.
 My country&#x27;s economy is currently in free-fall at the moment and need to start looking to get out as there really isn&#x27;t any sort of comprehensive or cohesive plan to get themselves out of this mess. I have family in both of the mentioned countries though my Dutch is a bit stronger than my German I guess.
 Checking if anyone on /r/networking knows the status of job market in those markets , and what skills are sought after there ? Have started scouring the job sites to get a reasonable idea what to expect though would be nice to get some opinions from actual grunts on the ground.
 Have 10+ years experience on the enterprise side of things . Have some AWS certs and busy burning through Azure and DevNet certs at the moment just to cement that I have knowledge in these areas as I deal with these at $dayjob but never really got the time to write the exams.
 Thank you to all that reply

                              <span>Say I have corporate network A, if I am connected directly to corporate network A, and the public (static) IP address of network A is whitelisted for the Postgresql database, I can connect only on my very first attempt. After which all connection attempts fail.
 If I am connected to network A via a VPN, (same network, same public IP) the connection works fine every time. 
 When running a traceroute to the database URI directly from network A, the requests time out at servers owned by the corporation running our managed firewall, but they claim to outbound traffic to Azure on port 5432 gets blocked. 
 When running traceroute connected to network A via VPN, it immediately just times out. 
 Does anyone have an idea of what might be wrong here?

From November 2022 through early January 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and authoring organizations identified the presence of indicators of compromise (IOCs) at a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency. Analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an APT actor, were able to exploit a .NET deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in Progress Telerik user interface (UI) for ASP.NET AJAX, located in the agency’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for remote code execution. According to Progress Software, Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX builds before R1 2020 (2020.1.114) are vulnerable to this exploit.[1]

                              <span>Past: I am a nearly 25yr system engineer that has mainly focused on VMware, storage, systems management and motioning. Starting as helpdesk in the late 90s and working up to infrastructure ops team manager, then back to contribute after a re-org. 
 Current: SysOps focused on infrastructure - compute and storage. About 70% on-prem/30% AWS.
 Future: Moving some of the environment to GCP, signing on with Snowflake for our data and reporting source. Manager has mentioned over the next few years our roles (2 Sr engineers incl me, 1 Jr engineer) will be migrating to more of a data engineering role. 
 My question for the hive: Where do I start my knowledge migration? I&#x27;m heavily involved in the Snowflake build and rollout. Should I start to focus on SQL, Python? Look into PowerBI and Looker (GCP)? I&#x27;m not feeling overwhelmed yet, but feel if I wait too much longer to get new knowledge learned, I&#x27;ll start falling behind. I&#x27;d like to stay on top of it all as much as I can.

 Hi, I am basically the only IT Guy in this place so I handle everything from preventing hacks to right down creating sites and password resets..
 Logic here is: that guy knows IT lets ask him to do all the work that is related to computer 
 So can someone please help me with this, if you have any experience.
 Basically my employer wants to setup a landing page on all the pcs in out company, so when someone opens a browser they get this site as the homepage to they can just open all the company sites without going around asking for links..
 Something similar to linktree

                              <span>Hello fellow admins, I come seeking your advice and knowledge on the best way to structure file permissions. Ideally the best-practice methods.
 The organization that I&#x27;m working for has struggled with file server permissions for 10+ years. I am a recent to the company and as I have to work and set permissions for users, their current mess makes it extremely difficult to follow some kind of structure for setting permissions.
 What I&#x27;m working with:
  
Global company with parent and child domains.
 Share permissions list various security groups.
 NTFS permissions have security groups with Full Control permissions.
 Security groups that are part of other security groups that are part of other security groups.
  
My first course of action is to remove all security groups from the Share permis…</span>

                              <span>A year and a half ago I was dumb, needed my first IT job and they were the only people that would hire me. Help Desk Agent at $12/hr, worst fucking place I&#x27;ve seen. Users so dumb that I wouldn&#x27;t trust with a car, let alone a computer.
 Then I went back to college, dropped that shitty job, got an internship at $30/hr; got 4 IT certifications, working on cool tech I never thought I would touch in a million years. Life&#x27;s pretty good, and have been at my current employer since.
 However, these recruiters at TEKsystems will not leave me alone. They keep calling me at odd hours of the day asking me if I want to work for pennies, they keep sending me emails for job listings that are asking for the whole IT department in one person. No matter how much I tell them I make, a new recruiter comes by every week or two and does the same thing. It&#x27;s like a bad ex that won&#x27;t leave me alone.
 My advice to the new people trying to break into IT reading this is to never touch TEKsystems, and to never give them your information. There has to be a mom &amp; pop shop near you that&#x27;ll be much better to work for, these parasites will just keep calling you no matter what. Learn from my mistake.

                              <span>At a loss for this - have you ever seen a VMWare VM, running 2016/SQL Server, that will periodically become unresponsive to RDP or console (while responding to ping) as if it was being overutilized - but VMWare (and separate metric collection) shows CPU usage is near zero and RAM usage dropped? It always clears up after a few minutes.
 We have a dozen servers with exactly the same software and only one is doing this; vMotion to another host doesn&#x27;t affect it. Nothing in the event logs leading up to it (other than AG disconnect notice during it) that&#x27;s unique. Persists after reboot. No indication in metrics of high CPU or RAM usage or high disk latency or queue length or anything leading up to the event.
 Did something in last month&#x27;s Windows Update really FUBAR it? Any idea what to look at?

 I could probably see a spinoff of this sub, turning into a weekly sysadmin recap podcast, but until then (if it ever happens) I&#x27;m curious if anyone has some recommendations for industry relevant podcasts, blogs or the like. Recently started listening to &quot;Grumpy Old Geeks&quot; and I periodically check out BleepingComputer amongst a few others, and looking for other places to check out.

                              <span>In two weeks I’m starting a Senior Admin job with absolutely no understanding of Powershell/Automation. 
 Unlike now, it wasn’t all the rage when I was in college so it was never taught to me. (I also didn’t go to a good school so that doesn’t help lol.)
 Management has made it clear that my focus should be streamlining their operations, making the IT department more efficient and organized as a whole. I’m sure that automation is going to need to play a big role in this, but again I’m clueless on this stuff.
 What path should I take to start my automation journey?

 I&#x27;m still getting into stuff but some things no one has the credentials for, or they can&#x27;t give me a solid answer on how things are setup. It&#x27;s kind of stressful but kind of fun at the same time. A big concern is getting into their Meraki cloud setup. Their AD is a mess but I can handle that and some of their servers haven&#x27;t been updated in 6+ months.

But starting today when I type in Adobe acrobat, the letter P has a line at the bottom, it does not happen to any other words and I cannot find a single solution online. I reinstalled, and it is up to date, PC didn&#x27;t go thru any updates either. Below is a link to a screenshot, typing in caps does not create the line.

                              <span>Hi,recently I have received a remark from the security team about short SSH host key on one of our servers. It&#x60;s 1024 bit, and as far as I know today&#x60;s standard is 2048 at least, even if 1024 bit length key is not broken yet.I&#x60;m just wondering what is a real attack scenario based on short ssh-rsa host key? Supposing (hypothetically ) the adversaries derived private key from public, what are those keys used for? What the attacker can do with that? I understand that host key pair is used for a host authentication, but is that all? Does it take part in key exchange procedure?
 Thanks

Also if the server is in headoffice and Client wanna connect to server then the only solution is VPN or there are other safer way to achieve this ? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never used Terraform and Kubernetes and the project hasn&#x27;t started yet, so if you think I should switch technologies feel free to let me know. I usually use Docker and Puppet.
 ​
 Suppose I have 3 dedicated servers and a VPS
 ​
  
A Dedicated server running Postgres on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running a Go server on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running Python sever on Kubernetes
 The VPS is used to monitor those servers and for admin tasks
  
​
 I have the following questions:
 ​
  
Let&#x27;s say that the Postgres server is running low on resources, does Kubernetes notify me to buy a new server? 
 
If I need to set alarms manually to buy a new server, then what are the best practices? How do you decide when it&#x27;s time to buy a new server? 
 
Can I buy a new server and not add it to any cluster and let Kubernetes decide if it wants to add it to any of the clusters mentioned above? Can I have servers on standby and then Kubernetes either use it for Postgres or Go etc?
 
How to protect against DDOS? Do I run all the clusters behind Cloudflare Or Do I buy additional firewall servers and run the clusters behind the firewall? Is it easy to set up Cloudflare?

 So essentially, we&#x27;re starting a new project, and we&#x27;ll need at least 3 servers and a VPS as mentioned above, the project might scale up and if it does, I want to have answers to those questions so I know how to act.

                              <span>All I hear is my manager slating someone who said something to him once, therefore we don’t help them. Or we put roadblocks in place so they can’t have what they request, using the excuse of GDPR or PCI. I won’t go into specifics but it’s pretty clear he’s lying, sometimes it’s just unrelated entirely but users buy into it because he bombards them with buzzwords and tech language. Overhearing it gives me second hand embarrassment. Someone complained once about wanting a different ISP because the last one let us down at a major event (this is true), all of a sudden my manager fucking hates him and refuses to assist him. Ever. 
 We also only choose suppliers that are his friends. The companies we choose get paid double what anyone else would charge, some work we could actually do in house as certain team members are actually certified in that area, but we choose to go with some random external contractors who charges insane amounts. 
 I don’t know how he’s getting away with it. Nobody dare question him because he confuses them with jargon and gets majorly defensive. 
 It’s making the job really rubbish, it feels like one vicious circle. User requests support with purchasing new software &gt; user complained about IT once &gt; we refuse to assist them &gt; user buys new system themselves anyway &gt; system gets implement with no support from us, constant roadblocks, dragging our heels &gt; poor end users get issues and ring for help, we refuse. It’s so fucking awkward as the person answering the phone to deny them assistance.
 I do this job to earn money, I know it’s not personal, but honestly it makes me sad how far behind we are with technology and not giving end users a solution that would really improve their work.

                              <span>Dear fellow sysadmins, seeking your advice on how to address a recent phishing email incident in our organization. The email successfully bypassed our existing security measures and landed in one of our executive&#x27;s inbox. The concerning part is that the email display name was cleverly spoofed to appear as our internal HR department, despite coming from an external email address r12fdf@icloud.com.
  
 I&#x27;m wondering if adding our HR department email group (hr@mycompany.com) and other similar department email groups as a &quot;user&quot; to be protected from impersonation in Microsoft Defender anti-phishing policy would prevent similar spoofed display emails from reaching any of our user&#x27;s inboxes.
  
 I would appreciate any suggestions, insights, or alternative solutions that you might have in this regard. Thank you for your help in advance! On M365 Exchange Online and Microsoft Defender.

                              <span>Hi, I was just wondering, if one wants a hardware token, why one should buy a yubikey ? Linux seems to accept any USB stick as a hardware token, as long as it&#x27;s initially configured by the pam library. Alternatives such as nitro/solo/only key exist, and known brands such as kingston and verbatim have models on which Fido protocol is implemented.
 So what would be the point of getting a pricy yubikey ? Because yubico partners with big services providers ? Is a &quot;pam homecooked&quot; hardware token not crossplatform ? not accepted by these service providers ? Is yubikey the answer only because it embed additional NFC hardware/feature ?
 I&#x27;d appreciate any teaching from you guys

                              <span>So long story short…I’m the sole IT guy at a nonprofit. Walked in the door and everything is dated, 2960’s, Sophos acting as router and FW and old ruckus wifi that can’t handle zoom calls on my MacBook. I came from a Cisco powerhouse, previous company was all in on them, but they had deep pockets. I was thinking Meraki for the network side, but I also see a lot of mention of Aruba. Looking to replace the above, plus we also have 4-5 other offices with 1-2 switches.
 Thoughts?

I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to do as I have to set a static route to the BGP neighbor via the xfrm that&#x27;s bound to the tunnel. Since I have two ports and two interfaces, I&#x27;m lost on how to configure it. Any thoughts? I understand BGP, but I&#x27;m new to it, so go easy guys.

                              <span>Hi we are looking at building a low latency MPLS/WAN deployment. We currently use SDWAN this is great but it runs over the internet. We currently see 15-20ms between sites. We have 2 x RO 5Gb on 10Gb connections at 4 key sites. One issue with this design is the latency is too high for our old applications. The other issue is the MTU is around 1300 usable with the SDWAN headers. 
 What I’m looking for is to put point to point connections between each of the sites. We already have 2 links between 2 of the sites that are 10Gb OSA giving us sub 1ms latency between these sites. This means I need 3 more point to point connections and 2 routers for each site. 
 Total 5 OSA links. 2 already in place. 8 routers with at least 4 x 10Gb connections on each. 
 Any advice or thoughts would be great. Thanks

                              <span>When we’re requested to perform an internal loopback for a carrier to their customer (since we perform last mile for them) it seems there’s a different procedure for our wavelength devices that we monitor through EPNM. Another department sets the loop and I believe I hear both customer and carrier need to be sending light. Could someone that understands this process perhaps provide a little detail as to how this works?

                              <span>Im designing a huge building with upwards 3000 switches on the Access layer. The distance between the access layer and thr core switches exceeds the limitation of Multimode optics (upwards of 1km). To minimize the cost of Single mode transceivers i have decided to add a distribution layer in the middle. This, in addtion to now enabling MM optics , enables better segregation of the network as I can bring L3 closer to the access layer.
 Client however does not like the distribution layer i the middle and whats to go Sm between Access and core.
 Still trying to convince the client that the 3 tier topology is best. Are there other advantages than the ones ive mentioned?
 P.S the core switches are big enough to handle either topology.

I thought about sniffing traffic and the MTU should be the largest fragmented packet, but this feels too complex and might be wrong for some of the interfaces. Is there a MTU negotiation protocol so I can find it easily? Or any other easy way for determining MTU only by sending/ receiving packets? Thanks in advanced!

 I have a few questions about the Mikrotik CCR2004-16G-2S+. I would like to run the router in a data center and was wondering, if it supports LACP and having multiple ports for just a single network? Also, is it suitable for Mass-IP-Whitelisting? I&#x27;m planning to give it instructions on what IP addresses to allow via API.
 Thanks in advance.

(Also, that switch has a fan failure). The switch I want to remove contains the SFP. I did some reading and am still a little fuzzy on what is going to happen. I have a spare sfp to move into the switch I plan to keep. My thoughts are:
 Backup Config
 Power down switch, install new sfp, configure vlans.
 Backup config
 Power back down and remove the stacking cable.
 Look in irf and look for &quot;missing&quot; switch and remove.
 Does this sound correct? Will the remaining switch automatically retain the config along with the ip address that is already assigned?
 Anything else I am missing or not thinking of?
 Thanks for any advice/assistance.

                              <span>At the moment we are looking for an improvement in our data centers. We have two separated DCs that have redundant layer 2 dark fiber connections (not in use). In both datacenters are collapsed core topologies which are then connected to the campus core. The datacenter Vlans are routed from the respective collapsed core, i.e. the SVIs are located on the core VPC pair. The VPC peers share the gateway IP using HSRP.
 Since we want to connect both datacenters with layer 2 and the vlans should be available in both datacenters to move VMs back and forth comfortably, the question is how to solve this in the smartest way. My extensive internet research, unfortunately, has not brought a perfect solution. In addition, the documentation is often outdated (OTV/DCI etc.).
 One often mentioned possibility is to have 2 gateways in the DCs with two HSRP groups, but this does not seem to be a suitable solution. I was thinking of pulling another layer into the topology, so that the collapsed core layer becomes the aggregation layer. Above then comes a real core layer with all SVIs and again HSRP gateway. One VPC peer of the core layer would then be in the first DC and the other VPC peer in the second DC.
 Does anyone have an idea or a suggestion or is there no getting around VXLAN for such concepts nowadays ?

 I&#x27;m in the process of implementing a network which has QoS enabled. We want to test all 1G interfaces at a high utilisation (99%) and passing the results to the customer. The testers being used are Exfo FTB-1 devices
 See below link to image of the network topology, the test scenarios and utilisation results.
 https://i.ibb.co/pyXvkZG/Ether-BERT-Test-Setup.jpg
 I’ve noticed an issue when testing the 1G interfaces of ROUTER-01 via the SWITCHES. I’m only seeing 76% utilisation when I expected closer to 100%. On further diagnosis using our testers, I am only passing 10% though the ROUTER-01 1G interfaces and then only 10% from SWITCH-01 via the interface ROUTER-01 connects to.
 I feel it may be related to the QoS config limiting the traffic (particularly the traffic testing at 10%…</span>

                              <span>Is it possible to have to APs connect and behave as if they were a very expensive Ethernet cable?
 I have two devices in different rooms that require an Ethernet connection, but there’s no physical connection to one of the rooms. Can I use a wifi ap to send wifi into that room, then pick it up with another AP and connect that to a switch/devices etc?

                              <span>The company I&#x27;m working for is attempting to set up a connection between a control shack and a piece of equipment wirelessly. They have purchased 2 Silex AP-100AH (which appear to be 802.11ah wireless access points) to communicate with each other between the equipment and the control shack.
 Is it possible for these two pieces of equipment to actually communicate with each other? It&#x27;s my (limited) understand that WAP&#x27;s can&#x27;t communicate with each other (unless they have a bridging feature). Am I wrong to think we need at least one BR-100AH which is a wireless bridge? What would the optimal network topography look like for this arrangement? Thanks!

                              <span>I am preparing to install some nexus 9ks to replace our old nexus hardware. While I don&#x27;t plan on making many changes during the upgrade process I am trying to get a feel for what I could be with them. So far I have been looking into potentially moving toward VXLAN and possibly leveraging guestshell to do occasional validation testing of network throughput using iperf or something. Not sure what I could use as a client to test against a 100gb network, but the switches are very oversized currently.
 However I know there is a lot more I could look into. Even if I don&#x27;t use it I enjoy learning interesting things and what I learn today will likely get used when the next absurd network requirement is asked. This is my first time having the opportunity to plot the future of a smaller datacenter and I don&#x27;t want the network to ever be the reason why something can&#x27;t be done (hence the current plans for VXLAN).
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions or avenues of research!

                              <span>I went down a rabbit hole the other day looking at PVLANs after dismissing them as not useful for me about 15 years ago. I can see some corner cases where they could be useful but they often just seemed unnecessary. It seemed like a way to drive segmentation without having to resubnet. 
 What use cases have people used them in?

 Simple networking question
 Hey, all. I’d consider myself to have intermediate network knowledge and I need some advice. …
 Currently I purchase 2 static IPs from my business internet provider. I use one for my public router, the other is for the company’s Fortigate which tunnels to corporate. The setup has worked well, but I’m slightly limited. 
 Since I’ve converted to VoIP, our non business class routers don’t do a good job handling traffic for 10 phones, even with QoS on and SIP disabled. 
 Currently, I’ve migrated the phones to behind the WAN. The Fortigate handles them much better, but I’m limited. There are blocked ports, some of which affect phone provisioning. The Fortigate is corporately controlled. I’m able to access the UI, but it’s connected to FortiManager for its config. Making any changes that large would throw a big red flag. 
 Should I keep the two statics, or should I save money and migrate to a single DHCP? If so, what can I put behind the modem to manage traffic (on the cheap!). Can I provision a managed switch to handle the ISP, QoS for the phones, and separate the traffic for the Fortigate? Do I have to buy something expensive like a Ubiquiti VLAN capable device? I’m open to any ideas.

It seems that a lot of these programs are built into the HR software, like ADP and BambooHR which we really don’t want. Can I get some recommendations or some ideas on how to get a handle on this?

But still he emails the vendor and includes the sys admins on a weekend no less. 
 What would you say or do?

                              <span>The Internet of Things. I hate this crap myself. Why do kitchen appliances need an internet connection? Why do washers and dryers? Why do door locks and light switches?
 Maybe I&#x27;ve got too much salt in my blood, but all this shit seems like a needless security vulnerability and just another headache when it comes to support.

                              <span>Sanity check please -- I have AAD-joined laptops that need to be added to InTune. Of course, it should be possible to check a box somewhere and have them auto-enroll the next time a domain user logs on, but from everything I&#x27;ve found, it isn&#x27;t. I have to either AAD unjoin/rejoin the devices, or have the users sign up manually -- either is a pain for remote devices that are scattered everywhere. I&#x27;m hoping someone can tell me I&#x27;m wrong. If I&#x27;m not wrong, I&#x27;d love to know a good reason (security or whatever) that this isn&#x27;t possible, because I just don&#x27;t get it, and the situation must come up all the time.

 Since the company already uses Microsoft 365, that somehow uses the Azure infrastructure, is there any particular method I should use when creating the Azure account?
 I&#x27;m going to keep searching and ask the Microsoft 365 support, but any tip coming from this sub will be really helpful.
 Thank you in advance.

 We have full credit card and drivers license inmformation stored insecurely in our POS system. I notified our CIO who notified our CFO and only new information has stopped being entered because I told the staff doing it to stop. They&#x27;re still storing physical copies and information that was uploaded has not been removed.
 We&#x27;re only reporting a single IP address to our PCI auditor (we have more than 100.) I and another team member notified our CIO and he has taken no action to remedy this situation.

My boss was (is) a raging narcissist who, while good in IT (once upon a time), is stuck in tech methods that are 15+ years old. This means that his way is always the right way, and he would gaslight you into obedience, and he demanded &quot;respect&quot; that he was right. So not only did we have to do things in ways that were wrong, we had to agree that he was right about it. 
 There were many instances where we were fixing/installing/changing something (either in infrastructure, or otherwise), when I knew it wouldn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>not sure if this is the proper forum or not, but I took the angle as the populus here has some influence in decision making of this type so looking more for an answer from a personal experience type of level
 So one of my other challenges is hardware vendors switching to subscription support models and software vendors ditching prpertual licensing for that sweet...sweet stock inflating continuous revenue stream (I&#x27;m looking at you Citirx and VMware!)
 We&#x27;re currently looking into upgrading our current Exchange 2013 environment (yes...I know its EOL beginning of April...grrrrr) and were looking into on-prem for depreciation and CAPex, but that was deemed too expensive so the upper&#x27;s considered O365 because it was a less expensive hit this year as OPex.
 Now, the C-suite is involved and I can&#x27;t do anything while it is discussed further. Discussions have been going on for over a year and a half and I am still at square one when either way, I could have been done already.
 I mean...it&#x27;s not like Email is a lifeblood of a business or anything /s
 My question...is it possible to depreciate expenses like O365 and subscription VMware/Citrix licensing?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Luckily for me, I am a part of a company that decided to cheap out on their VoIP implementation, meaning we are using a system that is horribly outdated. We are using a &quot;Zulty&#x27;s&quot; system that has a phone app you can download, but half the time it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.
 For example, if you receive a phone call, answer it, then end the call, you have to be sure you re-open the app, or else you will be stuck on &quot;On the phone&quot; status, meaning any additional phone calls will not ring to the app until you open the app again.
 So, my question is, has anyone ever had to deal with a situation where you need to route it through something else? Even if it is to route it through something like Google Voice, etc. we are dealing with a call group (our helpdesk line) that is hit or miss if the person on-call is receiving the phone call, because the app is terrible.
 My experience with VoIP is limited as you may be able to tell, but any suggestions are great. We can&#x27;t move to another system with just that number / phone group as it&#x27;s a part of a contract, however just being able to get a phone call through something whether it&#x27;s through another app that is better would make our lives so much easier.
 Thanks if you have any ideas!

                              <span>I’m still fairly new to IT and am tasked with preparing Windows laptops for new employees and replacements. 
 I’ve been doing the prep manually, but would like to switch to automating this terribly slow process, which includes:
  
Windows/driver updates
 8-10 App installs
 Debloating 
 Admin account creation, Name change, etc.
  
They don’t need to connect to a domain/GPO or use O365 licenses, just installing an agent for communicating with our remote mgt solution (not Intune).
 Would FOG, WDS-MDT, or another free solution be best? I’ve used VMs before and imaging drives with dd but prepping ready-to-go images is new to me. 
 Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

 the iSCSI-Server itself has 8 times 480GB hard drives.
 ​
 Now I&#x27;m not sure if this even makes sense anymore. Should I put every hard drive into 1 raid or makes it sense to split it up?

                              <span>So. My current org is a bit of a hoarder and we&#x27;re clearing out space for new projects. And are throwing out about 2 shelves worth of PDP-11 documentation manuals.
 I&#x27;m too young (1995) to properly know what is there. But most of it seems to be about NSX-11 which seems to be a 1970&#x27;s real-time OS for PDP-11 computers. As well as some Fortran references for it also. 
 Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have the time or space to store it. To consider digitising them. I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s valuable.
 So ideally, I was hoping to try sell to a collector. But would definitely consider just giving it to a good home and maybe pay shipping (depending on location). I&#x27;d just hate to see it destroyed if it still has value.

                              <span>I am currently managing an Exchange Server 2016 that is working in hybrid with Office Online. However, the server is old and slow. I am considering decommissioning the server and moving to Exchange Online only. I wanted to share my thoughts and get some feedback on whether this is possible or the correct way to go about things.
 First, let me explain a bit about my current setup. Our organization has been using Exchange Server 2016 for several years now, and we implemented a hybrid deployment with Office Online. This allows us to have the benefits of both on-premises and cloud-based Exchange, including password and directory synchronization. 
 However, as we continue to evaluate our IT infrastructure, we are considering moving to Exchange Online only. There are several reasons for this, including cost savings, security, and reliability.
 So, is it possible to decommission the Exchange Server 2016 and move to Exchange Online only? We want to keep our AD syncing with Azure and our passwords syncing. I read this article (below) that says we should keep an Exchange server online, but we are at the point where I&#x27;d either need to spin up some new VMs or go Exchange Online only.

                              <span>Client has about 75,000 users that need access to between 2 and 6 platforms each. Currently we run a SAML IDP with a custom authentication process that reads from multiple databases, no central user storage or management, authentication is a function of a matching email existing in certain locations and the values of various database columns.
 There is no single source of truth for user information. Would like to store users in one place along with roles/permissions management. We transmit some of these as SAML attributes currently, sending what is relevant to each service provider.
 Most of these users are low value, not paying customers or employees and the client deemed Okta too expensive, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d go above $0.25 per user but they&#x27;ll happily pay tens of thousands for us to set up something free.
 It&#x27;s not exactly my wheelhouse and I&#x27;d be doing this entirely on my own with a restrictive timeline/budget so I need some advice. Would like to stick with SAML auth since I know it works on all things users need access to and I have a decent understanding of it at this point. Could Azure AD suit these needs? That&#x27;s my 2nd choice after Okta but the presentation to me as a developer isn&#x27;t as clear.
 I&#x27;m leaning towards a cloud product recommendation and help setting it up vs something we&#x27;ll have to install, configure, host and maintain, because of the severely limited resources, but may have to go with something self-hosted due to budget constraints.

 This script first defines the name of the app to be blocked. It then gets the path to the startup folder for the current user&#x27;s Terminal Service profile from the registry. If the startup folder exists, the script checks if the app is already there, and if so, it exits. If the app is not there, it creates a shortcut to the app and adds it to the startup folder. Finally, the script outputs a message indicating that the app has been blocked on startup.

                              <span>Hello fellow admins! I&#x27;m experiencing the strangest issue with my Lenovo Slim 7 Carbon. Intermittant touchpad operation. It just seems to &#x27;lose&#x27; my finger. I thought maybe it&#x27;s dirty, or dirty fingers, but for some reason, I&#x27;ll be moving my pointer and suddenly it stops. I then have to wait for it to decide to work again. No issue with using multi-fingers to scroll, zoom, etc. Just the single finger Has anyone else experienced this? As you can imagine, this has made remote access more challenging than usual when I can&#x27;t use a mouse.

                              <span>I have a windows server with a data volume that’s over 200TB that I need to back up. I am aware of MS 64TB VSS limitation and my go to Veeam backup won’t work. Is there any software out there that would allow me to backup this volume? I am backing up to a storage server running FreeNAS. Any suggestions would be much appreciated

                              <span>Ok, so I&#x27;ve been in this space for a few years, and have worked with servers from HP, Dell, Cisco, even a smattering of supermicro and fujitsu. But we got about 40 servers from Lenovo about two years ago, and they have been nothing but a constant headache. Which fine, A bad firmware here, a faulty driver there, it has happened with all of them. The problem comes down to the support. 
 Their support has NO clue what they are doing, Every time we call in, we have to explain the situation to them multiple times, We demonstrate the problem to them, and they cannot comprehend what the issue is. Like they&#x27;ve never done break/fix before in their lives, and so troubleshooting steps are foreign to them. Their knee jerk reaction to any issue is a motherboard swap. We&#x27;ve had the motherboard on a system replaced 7 and 8 times without resolving the very obviously firmware issue. 
 The techs they send out are all contract, and other than replacing system boards have no knowledge or desire to do anything beyond swapping boards, there have been several times they have failed to update serial numbers and other things (I believe they have all been IBM techs). 
 The newest experience has me laughing, We opened a ticket for a power supply gone bad, and they somehow confused us with another company, and Now we&#x27;re invited to a teams meeting monday for their issue. 
 Has anybody had a good experience with Lenovo support for servers? any tips? 
 When I did desktop support, I LOVED Lenovo thinkpad support, they had amazing support processes, and super knowledgeable people, fast response times, etc. It has been the exact opposite with the servers.

                              <span>I launched a software licensing service not that long ago. As a Software Vendor (I made a desktop app that I was looking to to sell), I found existing Software Licensing solutions (FlexLM, Sentinel, Wibu, Nalpeiron) were either prohibitively expensive to adopt and difficult to use, or just didn&#x27;t have sufficiently robust capability.
 I think looking at it from the software Vendor&#x27;s perspective is only part of the problem, since many end users also complain about licensing (more so than the vendors!). Looking through other threads, some of the big issues that kept coming up seem to be:
 - Easier to &quot;steal&quot; rather than install and activate correctly
 - Difficult to get buy in from higher ups to switch to a software with easier to work with licensing policies. We&#x27;re talking monolithic On-Prem License servers with UI from the 90s that have never been updated used to enforce concurrency.
 - There is no single agreed upon standard, every ISV might have their own definitions for floating licenses, a seat, or a user-based license provisioning. This inconsistency makes SAM automation a nightmare.
 - ISVs sometimes prefer to prevent piracy rather than deploy in an environment that they cannot control (in a VM, for example).
 - Hardware Dongles aren&#x27;t going away.
 - Node Locking fails often for many reasons (MAC address isn&#x27;t persistent; you attach a new dock and the device fingerprint changes etc.). 
 What else could be improved to make licensing software less of a headache for everyone? #opensource

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 We are looking at deploying WPA3 on our APs for our AD managed devices.
 Currently have an 802.1x WPA2 GPO with computer cert based authentication setup.
 Issue running into is our DCs are still server 2016, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to setup WPA3 within the GPO settings. Server 2022 does have that option for WPA3, so would it be possible to just introduce a brand new 2022 VM into our DC environment to apply these settings? Planning on upgrading all DCs to 2022 by the end of this year, but just want to start testing WPA3 802.1x right now.
 Thanks!

 We’re backing his NAS of 26 TB up to backblaze at the moment. Have any of you run into a company storing large active media files and if so what was your storage solution for a good price and what did the workflow look like?

                              <span>Lately I have been dealing with a ton of miscommunications and issues arising from users of all levels just not reading an email I have sent to either inform them of something or asking for clarification. 
 Things like &quot;Hey I tried calling but you weren&#x27;t at your desk. I left a voicemail and this email is a follow up when can we meet to get thing done&quot; only for a few days later I get a call from a supervisor on how I hadn&#x27;t got thing done cause user never responded to me
 ​
 to multiple emails about people needing to set up their new account for something only to have someone furious at me that they where never made aware of new account and they don&#x27;t have time to create a username and password.
 ​
 Even simple things like asking for clarification on a problem, then not hearing from a person till they walk by 3 days later and ask if i have a solution for their problem that I wasn&#x27;t even sure what the issue was. 
 ​
 Even in the last staff meeting I mentioned I would distribute my quick presentation via email only to loudly hear an employee say &quot;Well no one reads your emails anyway&quot; 
 ​
 I have been looking for my out (though i know this problem is everywhere) but it seriously just makes me feel like i am losing my mind when things end up being My fault cause someone doesn&#x27;t read their email.

 Then employee B does 3000 tickets in a year, has feedback on 40 of them, and has worse numbers because he&#x27;s exposed to more tickets and customers. Would you still just take the average rating based on the amount of feedback tickets received? Picture of reference of what i&#x27;m referring to:

 Jeez, navigating this comment section is a minefield. Seems like a lot of people are drawing conclusions from me asking a question, when I didn&#x27;t necessarily say anything like that. So to answer a couple questions:
  
I have to present SOMETHING to upper management when I&#x27;m justify a pay increase or promotion, or the opposite. KPI&#x27;s are necessary unfortunately. I wish I could…</span>

 New integration to enable Zoom + Meet interop (if you have conference hardware for either) to join one type of meeting from the other.
 Something I&#x27;ve been waiting for in the last few years but can finally put the pitchforks away. Turned it on for the org and it was seamless in picking up Meet links in my calendar invite (we are a Zoom org with Mac minis/iPads as conference hardware, Google Workspace as calendar source).

                              <span>Hi all. A small company I help has moved all users to Passwordless . Now they ask how to get emails on their iPhones. App passwords no longer work as basic auth is disabled.
 Any advice? Thanks
 UPDATE: So far, the option of using TAP (suggested by u/zm1868179) seems to be the best option to try. So far, looks promising; although the TAP is supposed to stay active for 60 minutes, my outlook profile on iPhone is still active and still fetching mails. Not sure when the system will ask to log in again, but definitely not after 60 minutes. Will update the post.
 P.S. TAP is cumbersome as this has to be created by an admin, but it is kind of okay for a small company

                              <span>So I was using Nutanix X-ray to test some brand new clusters this week. Some of my tests were failing vMotion. Backup system grabs any VM not in a policy and backs it up to a default policy. Network was super slow this morning. Net team found our backup clusters were maxing out the wan. The test VMs which are terabytes in size were backed up and were being replicated to other sites. I owned up to it and we all had a good laugh.

 We&#x27;re being tasked with deploying it for easier onboarding.
 I&#x27;ve found some tutorials here and there but looking for some formal training that I can give to a team for everyone to get brought up to speed.
 Any recommendations other than digging through MS docs and watching youtube videos?

 Example: Test Environment A would patch 3 days after patch Tuesday. Prod Environment A would patch 12 days after patch Tuesday.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a decent patch tool for a multi-domain multi-site enterprise environment that supports this capability?
 Ideally the tool would be able to patch Windows and Linux OS environments as well as third party software (Acrobat Reader, Zip utilities, ect), but the biggest need at this point is Windows OS updates.

 Active Directory was a mess. I&#x27;ve mostly straightened that out and reorganized OUs and such. They finally agreed to the purchase of a ticketing system. That got funded today....Really happy about that. I am sick of getting calls, emails, team messages, skype messages, texts, and office pop-ins. They are finally receptive to purchasing a remoting system. 
 But what really pushes my buttons are that the Leadership is stubborn on wanting all users to have administrative access to everything! I&#x27;ve showed them university SOPs. I&#x27;ve cited my state&#x27;s government SOPs on admin credentials. I&#x27;ve told them I do not fill comfortable trading convenience for security. 
 My reasoning for posting this would be to ask for advice. Does anyone have any &quot;scary&quot; stories I can let my leadership read. I&#x27;m looking for cautionary tales that will scare them into submission! Also looking for advice on how to handle these asshats!
 Thanks

                              <span>After 20 years with all our stuff in the same server room I have the opportunity to design a new one. This is not a major installation, no raised floor CRAC or fancy fire suppression system. What might I incorporate into the design and layout to make things a bit more efficient and my life a little easier?
 Space is not finalized yet but it will be a minimum of 180 SF for four racks. Maybe a lot more. I will be installing ladder racks and Netfloor tiles. I will install new Ethernet throughout the office area too. It will have redundant cooling and a dedicated electrical subpanel.
 If enough space is available I plan to install a standing bench for equipment staging and diagnostic work.
 -edited to add, I did a very thorough cost analysis of moving to colo or public cloud, not going to happen-
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Looking to deploy a handful of MDE Plan 2 licenses to a few endpoints for some testing, turned on the 25 license pack trial and assigned the license to a few endpoints, deployed the necessary Intune configuration policies to turn on EDR and right away noticed that it unlocked some security reporting UI features across all devices.
 As an example the advanced threat hunting schema tables now include Device prefixed tables, and it has details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for P2.
 My intention is to keep most devices on Plan 1 while having a subset of devices on Plan 2. 
 Why is the portal letting me see details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for the higher tier? Is there some setting that can restrict this and filter out the noise down to P2 licensed devices only.

                              <span>Does anyone have an easy way that they update Reader DC for the company? All new installs have auto update and install set on by default but our laptops don&#x27;t stay on for a full 3 days so the timer resets and I have machines that are out by several versions. I have been looking online for powershells or just using the installer but those options don&#x27;t seem to work anymore. Adobe on their websites just says to open the menu and check for updates. I don&#x27;t want to have to do this on every machine. I have everything else automated for updates in our domain but Adobe. I use PDQ Deploy/Inventory if that helps.
 So back to my point, does anyone have a way to force a manual update for Adobe Reader DC?

                              <span>Hi, title is somewhat misleading
 I want to get certified, as of now i was sort of just thrown into the IT part of my job as i was &quot;good with computers&quot; and to be honest i love it, i&#x27;ve been doing it for the better part of 5 years now, setting up Intune, managing O365, creating a hybrid environment, setting up servers, FTP, Azure, Print servers, file servers, etc.. 
 I&#x27;ve been thinking/studying to take AZ-900 but what other Certifications would you recommend which would help me prove that i know what i say i know if you catch my drift.
 I would like to learn more about Security and Microsoft as well as Networking
 I did think about taking Security+ and CCNA but as i dont do any Networking in my job it&#x27;s hard to learn it as i&#x27;m not working with it daily
 Thank you for reading and your response! And thank you for any tips!

                              <span>So we have a client that uses an email to send personal information and documents to their clients. They specified that the email has to be able to send encrypted messages and multiple users need to be able to read and reply back to emails from it. No problem! we can set it up as a shared mailbox, and enable encryption on it.
 However, a phone call with the user, she also now mentions that she also needs her front desk to be able to log into the account to send scanned documents from this email and not just a shared email. This makes it a little more complicated because you now have to have a license attached to it for it to be logged into. No worries though, we can do this we just enable MFA (Now that it&#x27;s going to be physically able to be logged into), give read/send permissions to the needed users so they can access from their email, and enable Encryption on the email. All done!
 Third call with the user comes, she now mentions that the email will be used for SMTP from a 3rd party with their application that they use to send out contracts, documents, etc. This is where it gets complicated, I have no idea how to keep this email secure with MFA (As far as my understanding, SMTP will not work with MFA enabled), we now can&#x27;t change the password, or it&#x27;s going to break the application from sending emails, and now we have 4 different people inside of this email that has access to personal, sensitive information.
 So my question is, how would you go about it to make this account secure and meet the requirements. We can make another account if needed and makes sense to do so.
 Requirements
 1) Allow SMTP
 2) Possibly Disable Login, if not then enable MFA.
 3) Allow shared account access from multiple users.

                              <span>I have a Dell R540 12 bay with 1 CPU and 96GB of RAM, it also has a Boss card and a 4 x 1Gb NIC installed in the raiser card slots. 
 I noticed there is a PCIe 16 slow with two other 4 or 8x slots betside it that are beside the riser slot. Does anyone know if these slots work and how do I add cards because I installed a intel x520-DA2 into it and the ports blink on the outside of the card but the card isn&#x27;t seen by the system bios, idrac, nor Windows which is very odd!? 
 Thanks,

                              <span>Not technically sysadmin, so please delete if not allowed. I have asked in r/cybersecurity, but you guys are also knowledgable, so asking here too.
 I&#x27;d like start hosting some cyber-security competitions for some kids. Something like these: https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/guides/top-cybersecurity-competitions/, but ones that I control to whip out and use outside of competition days.
 Essentially, the way I see it working is that I produce a linux VM, make some insecure changes (no updates, passwords changed to 1234, password requirements, chmod 777 some config files, random executable in home dir, no anti-virus, etc.) and then get the kids to find and fix those changes, and get scored on the number of fixes they do.
 I can do all this with scripts etc. to check various scenarios and build the images, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any ideas on where to start or if they have an idea of scoring or any issues that should be included.
 Thanks in advance!

 I tried preparing the text in a mail and then copy &amp; pasted it over into the field however, the final notification mail then has no formatting at all. No line-breaks etc.

                              <span>Hi!
 I use WSL2 Ubuntu distribution for my development stuff and sometimes i need to access my Windows&#x27;s localhost from WSL. There is an IP in /ets/resolv.conf that can be used to access Windows but firewall blocks all requests from WSL by default, after some digging i could not find a way to fix it with firewall rules so i tried to disable firewall just for WSL&#x27;s virtual network adapter and it worked.
 Here is powershell command, that i use: Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Public -DisabledInterfaceAliases &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot;
 I does the thing as i said but the problem is that every time i disable/enable firewall with it, firewall spits out permission prompts for every program that i already permitted before. Sometimes it is very annoying, especeially when permissions are reset for my DLNA and network sharing sevices and i can no longer access my PC via local network.
 Is there something that i&#x27;m doing wrong? Would appreciate any advice on how to configure firewall to allow outbound requests from WSL environment without having to explicitly set permissions for every program again every time.

                              <span>Has anyone else noticed a big uptick in Microsoft 365 sign in issues reported the past two weeks for people running Windows?
 ​
 Various apps from Word, Outlook, Excel to OneDrive all repeatedly prompting to sign in with their M365 credentials over and over. 
 ​
 Not seeing any pattern to as it seems to be impacting all Windows clients from local AD joined, AD joined with AADconnect sync, AzureAD Joined, Windows Hello, Regular password, or even basic workgroup. All same problem all in the past two weeks all different M365 tenants.
 ​
 ​
 The workaround is to 
  
open Word and click File - Account - Sign out all accounts
 
Then log off, log back in as a different local admin account and delete the folder: C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPluginxxxxx\
 
Then reboot and log back in to Windows profile and sign back into the apps again.
 
 ​
 But even with that some people get the problem again the following day.
 ​
 Anyone else seeing this?

Do you need any view to show to your boss (you know, to feel informed and &#x27;in control&#x27;)? Are you using any of them for NOC display or do you prefer dashboards like Grafana?
 The customer I am helping right now has created some simple diagrams about memory, CPU etc for switches, some temperature sensors from the server room, and UPC battery levels as tracked in the software they use for monitoring. This is, however, some really old version of the software and the view with diagrams needs to be scrolled so no use in displaying them on the monitor screen. Also, they need something to show/display to the boss which is rather general, and colorful but &#x27;not too alarming&#x27; (should not be screaming about some newly detected problem too early, more like day average situation overview).
 Any advice? What would you put on the &#x27;boss dashboard&#x27; about your network? What type of view would you do just to help you/your colleagues do their job?

                              <span>Hi all, I hope I&#x27;m allowed to ask this here, if not please let me know where I might be able to find help. 
 I started an internship a few months ago and was tasked with setting up a HA cluster with a few test servers, after about 2 or 3 weeks I figured it out and got it set up. Keep in mind I am studying Computer Science, so my knowledge on networking and system administration is limited, honestly not sure why they gave me this work to do. 
 Now a few days ago they gave me access to a live server they want me to set up and I ran into an error I don&#x27;t know how to fix. 
 I am using two Window server 2019 and running mssql 2019. I wanted to set up the failover cluster, but when running the validate configuration wizard, I get this error:
 DHCP status for network interface &#x27;servername&#x27;.&#x27;domainname&#x27; - Ethernet0 differs from network Cluster Network 1.
 The servername and domainname is filled in, but I just left it blank for security reasons 
 I have tried googling the problem, but I&#x27;m not getting any luck there. Also no one in the office knows how to work with databases, and the one guy that does kinda know what is going on, is very busy with other stuff so I can&#x27;t bother him too much.

                              <span>Hi,
 This has been something I&#x27;ve been breaking my head over the last few days:
 - Newly installed VEEAM v12 server on Server 2022, no firewall active, 3 NIC&#x27;s in an LACP trunk. VLAN dedicated for the connection to the backup repo, VLAN for management of the backup server.
 - Newly installed Linux repository server, firewall disabled (for testing), installation of veeam agent went fine through SSH, LACP bond of 4 NIC&#x27;s untagged in backup VLAN.
 - I can SSH into the linux repo from the BS, no problem.
 - Trying to create a backup gives a connection error on port 2501 and it fails.
 - netstat on the linux host shows a connection from BS ip to host on port 2500 and 2502... 
 netsstat -tulpna | grep veeam
 tcp6 0 0 192.168.30.11:2500 192.168.30.10:65210ESTABLISHED 21672/veeamagent
 tcp6 0 0 192.168.30.11:6162 192.168.30.10:65311ESTABLISHED 20282/veeamtranspor
 tcp6 0 156 192.168.30.11:2502 192.168.30.10:65313 ESTABLISHED 21881/veeamagent
 ​
 Any suggestions on the cause?

                              <span>Most backup software lets you do synthetic backups where your client backup is &quot;incremental forever&quot; but every so often a full backup is assembled.
 How often are you running those full backups and especially with workloads that are large but with a low change rate where you&#x27;re just backing up the same TBs of data every time you take a full backup.
 I guess there&#x27;s no right answer just trying to read the room on where it&#x27;s headed.

 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Since The Breach Of All Breaches in December October August, we have been investigating alternatives to LastPass.
 So far we&#x27;ve explored Bitwarden and 1Password, and I&#x27;ve also had a couple of brief flings with NordPass and Dashlane. None of them come up to feature parity with LastPass, but 1Password&#x27;s security architecture was compelling.
 However, last week I came across Keeper, and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve found that is enterprisey enough to have everything we&#x27;re after, without being a full blown PAM/PAW solution like CyberArk. 
 The features we&#x27;re after are:
  
Azure AD integration for login and user provisioning
 Custom templates for records
 Granular sharing
 Ease of use for &#x27;normal&#x27; users
 Actually secure
  
Does anyone having any experience with Keeper to either say they&#x27;d recommend it, or recommend completely avoiding it?
 I&#x27;ve heard bad things about their Firefox plugin, but I will be doing a trial personally to validate that.
 Also, does anyone know of any in depth security assessments carried out by independent security experts that can validate that their security architecture is good?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to write small programs most likely with simple GUIs that I can put on other computers. (For now just simple things like editing a value in .ini or .xml files, etc). Python is my go-to but since that requires having Python installed on the PC it&#x27;s running on...
 Is it worth trying to learn batch or PowerShell, or seeing if I can transform Python scripts into .exes? Or perhaps something else entirely?

                              <span>One of our clients is experiencing an issue I haven&#x27;t come across often on MS365.
 There is a shared mailbox used by the sales team. Periodically they&#x27;ll get hit with waves of 50-100 per hour bounce-back notifications or &quot;Mail Delivery Failure&quot; messages. It&#x27;s all mail servers responding with limited details, as in they don&#x27;t include the original message, and from what I can tell the headers are not original so I can&#x27;t glean much info.
 I&#x27;m still not 100% certain if this is originating with us. I&#x27;d like to confirm if someone has gained access to the outgoing SMTP and is sending from our mail server or if it&#x27;s spoofed emails being bounced back to our spoofed email address.
 Does anyone have any helpful advice?
 The only useful info I&#x27;ve found so far on the backend is that &quot;Real-Time Detections&quot; show the incoming &quot;Mail Delivery Failure&quot; emails as quarantined malware emails. It lists us as the recipient and the mail servers as the senders.
 Where do I go from here?

                              <span>I often see rants here about working conditions. So here is mine!
 I LOVE my job. We have a strong development team that is super fun! We go for drinks, talk shop, talk smack and in general have a good time! We support each other when we need to complain about feces for brains business people and help each other when needed.
 My job itself is very challenging and I get a lot of freedom in developing our infrastructure. The expertise in our team is skyhigh and I learn everyday. Every few months when I look back and I am amazed at how much I learned. I am allowed to make mistakes, no hard feelings. 
 Our team leads have vision for the future and know how to communicate this. As far as I can tell this vision is in line with the developments in our field.
 I get to be responsible for processes and I get to criticize policy and processes. If spearhead an effort to change something people listen with an open mind. Often people will think along with me and enable me to actually make a difference. 
 I work exclusively with Linux systems we fully administer ourselves. The only windows in my life is the labtop because thats policy. 
 The lunch at work is cheap and amazing in quality for what you pay. 
 Sure there are bad days and good days. The business is terrible at software development lifecycle. We get involved way too late. There are large problems with understaffing in our team. But in general the good far outweighs the bad. 
 I LOVE my job.

 Checking the logs and the ufw rules I noticed a large chunk of those entries were from IPs assigned to Digital Ocean.

Items suggested to write about include working preferences, likes / dislikes, and other personal details. It isn’t compulsory. The general expectation is that something is written.
 Question:
 How do you handle these requests?
 If you don’t agree with it, how do you handle it?
 If you agree with the idea, what do you write?

 The app essentially reads the settings from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App.
 Problem is that all computer accounts are in a single OU and it&#x27;s beyond my decision &amp; control to re-organize them in different OUs. And the requirement is the App needs to be configured based on user&#x27;s role, so it needs to be User-specific settings. Computer is shared by multiple users shift work.
 What could be some creative ways to allow the app to be configurable via domain GPO and User-specific? Some ideas...
  
Insert them into HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App but the App would not read it there.
 PowerShell script on login to apply the settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App. But the settings also needs to be cleared on logoff so the next user&#x27;s settings can be applied? Or maybe clearing the settings isn&#x27;t necessary since the next user&#x27;s settings will just get re-applied.
 Etc...

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a DevOps consultant since late 2021. So far it has been un-fulfilling. I basically did this because everyone on my team left my old job aside from a couple people, including my manager leaving and it was the only easy option to get off the sinking ship. I&#x27;ve been a Systems Engineer previously for about 10 or so years.
 I can either go back to my old job possibly but no one on my team is there aside from two people, or try to find a new job that is remote only. I&#x27;ve been fortunate that my last 2 jobs out of 3, I&#x27;ve put my heart in and have gotten promotions and been able to do things that helped the company. With my latest it&#x27;s just not the same.
 Has anyone been in the same boat? There are some people that got me here at my current job and I feel like I might burn bridges but I want to have that fire back in. I just feel like I work best devoted my time to fix things at a company as opposed to coming in, doing a project and leaving. I hate the feeling of starting a project with a bunch of new people and rinsing and repeating with other new people. It causes so much anxiety for me. I prefer to go to midsize company and pave the road and make a name for myself (based on my previous jobs this has worked out...)

                              <span>Im trying to come up with a resolution for an issue at work. Im a desktop support engineer but do not have access to configs for the switches. I have an end user whose mapped drives are suppose to connect automatically at start up but they don&#x27;t. The drives show up with red x&#x27;s and only when you click them it turns green. From my understanding windows runs a script at start up when it is configured to connect mapped drives automatically. Is it possible that the windows script is timed to run before the stp forward delay timers reach zero and move the switch port into a forwarding state? If so, portfast is most likely disabled. Just looking for some insight before I decide to escalate this ticket.

                              <span>Aloha all,
 I work out in Hawaii, and we have 2 offices on 2 islands, served by 2 ISP&#x27;s - Office_A is served by HawaiianTel on the island of Maui, and Office_B is served by Spectrum on the island of Oahu.
 Question: why do I get 2 different traceroute results from either location when running a simple traceroute between the 2 sites?
 From Office_A to Office_B, it&#x27;s 14 hops, that actually runs from Maui -&gt; Oahu -&gt; California -&gt; Oahu.
 However, from Office_B to Office_A, it&#x27;s just 9 hops bouncing from router to router on Oahu before heading to Maui.
 Why wouldn&#x27;t the traceroute results be more or less the same?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve identified a situation where traffic from a cloud provider is slow from a specific ISP. After discussions with both the ISP and the cloud provider, they are essentially pointing fingers at each other. 
 Obviously traffic shaping from the ISP is a very possible scenario- but aside from that, there could be issues with the traffic between the ISP and the cloud provider server- right? Of the parties involved, who would be responsible for sorting that out?

                              <span>Ok, so hopefully someone can advise here.
 We have quite a complicated setup which I&#x27;ll miss a lot of information out to keep this brief... we have an OSPF instance (OSPF 20) with our ISP. The ISP advertises several routes to us including a default route and a route to one of our remote branches among DCs.
 We also receive a route to our remote DC from another OSPF instance (OSPF 10) with our internal routers. This is redistributed into OSPF by the neighbor route as an E1 route.
 At present, the route to the remote DC that is making it into the routing table is the one from the ISP (OSPF 20), while we want the traffic to route internally via OSPF 10.
 I&#x27;ve tried a few ways to fix this but can&#x27;t seem to crack it. I though using a route-map against a distribution list on the ISP OSPF instance to set the metric higher would work if I matched the route I was interested in, but it seems to filter out all routes from the ISP EXCEPT the one I want to affect.
 I feel like I&#x27;m missing something crazy obvious here, any chance one of you geniuses can help me out?
 Thanks

                              <span>Networkers of reddit,
 This issue first came up with a client that couldn&#x27;t process their CC transactions after coming back from lunch. Essentially they could not resolve xyz domain and further examination revealed other domains also not being able to be resolved but 95% of domains on the internet are being resolved.
 Ive pegged it down to the Fortigate(s) simply because if we Ethernet into the back of Comcast modem DNS resolves to these specific domains. Alright so then I remembered our own business uses Comcast business and also has a Fortigate 61E and I can reproduce the problem on our network. I even noticed now I cant even hit the slickdeals website to which I was just checking it out last week on my machine. OK so I if i know the IP and setup a forward zone on the DC to the IP for the domain it routes and comes up. If i setup my machines DNS to googles/openDNS/comcast DNS it still will not resolve. If i nslookup using another DNS server besides the domain controller it will not resolve. I feel this eliminates the windows DNS DC(s). Packet captures show the DNS requests going to the DC out so I dont understand why the requests are timing out. I can double check the WAN packet capture but why would it fwd DNS request for certain domains and not others?
 No changes have been made to the Fortigates OS 7.x on any of these separate sites and neither have any web filtering rules other than blocking foreign countries inbound. There are no external connector feeds to 2 of the sites and ive disabled them on our site. I can replicate this problem across 3 different places across the city the only correlation being they are all on comcast business using fortigates across multiple workstations. Software upgrades on the fortigates are manual so I can only think of something being bugged, exploited or i need other ideas. I hope ive explained enough to get some insight from you guys.

                              <span>Ran into a very interesting problem yesterday, so I thought I would share it here. 
 We have a small network in one of our outlying buildings consisting of a Sophos Firewall, and an Aruba switch. There are 3 subnets, LAN, WiFi, and the VPN.
 Yesterday users on the Wifi and VPN subnets were unable to connect to the Server on the LAN subnet, and vice versa. Connections LAN to LAN work flawlessly. No configuration or hardware changes had been made. 
 We noticed after doing some discovery that when attempting to ping PCs on the LAN subnet from any other subnet the packets would timeout 92% of the time. There would be a long series of timeouts, then a brief period (about 30 seconds or so) of connection that would work fine, then the connection would start timing out again for about 8(ish) minut…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re standing up a new site, management didn&#x27;t heed my warnings of lead times issues for our first-pick cisco hardware, so now I&#x27;m scrambling to find an available alternative. I&#x27;ve searched for suggestions between Aruba and Juniper, but I&#x27;m running into a lot of trouble comparing their exact specs. The short of it is, I need a 1RU, 48GBE (SFP+ / multgig a bonus, but not priority), POE+(at least 10 ports), L3 managed(or &quot;2+&quot;), with dual redundant PSU (Field replaceable preferred, but not required). 
 The closest I can tell, I should be looking at the 3810M or EX4100 series, but would really appreciate any input. If anyone could point me to a matrix that actually compares multiple brands, I will send you a digital kiss as well!

 https://imgur.com/a/YdH3qUU
 From my understanding the firewall should be between the nexus switches and a router that performs BGP
 My questions are:
  
Am I right about the placement of the firewall and the BGP router?
 If the firewall doubles as an IPS, does that change anything?
 Does this require 2 firewalls?

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting asked a lot for these so they may be worth learning more for everyone. 
 CCNP(some require but being asked less for it)
 R&amp;S: People are asking for Aruba, Extreme, and Arista more and more. 
 Firewalls... Palo and Fortinet ... anything is good 
 NAC: Clearpass or ISE, my forescout experience matters not. 
 NetDevOps: Being asked about Python and Ansible now a lot of the time. 
 Security: Massive Pandora box, asked for anything pretty much.

                              <span>Just trying to get an idea of how difficult this upgrade is. I do a little admin work on our Checkpoint firewalls (2 physical fws + 1 virtual mgmt/smartconsole). From what I gather, the mgmt console should be upgraded first and then the actual firewalls. Can I just call support during the upgrade in case it doesn&#x27;t go smoothly or will i need pro services for something like this?

 ​
 Two issues.
  
When trying to &#x27;write&#x27; or &#x27;commit&#x27; get error that Invalid input detected at &#x27;^&#x27; marker
 Need to edit/remove the network command listed in above article. I applied the wrong /30 IP address. 
  
I&#x27;ve tried:
  
disabling BGP, renabling
 Importing config file that I created before making BGP commands

                              <span>Regardless of which firewall we are using from one of the popular brands like Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, or Sophos Fortinet, PA, Cisco or Sophos, what is the best way to allow a user to establish SSL VPN from only a specific device?
 While researching, I found that many of the admins suggest using PKI certificate-based authentication. However, I am concerned about the downsides of using a cert-based VPN.
 Firstly, certificates have a limited lifespan, which means I will have to monitor the age of all issued certificates continually. 
 This could mean a lot of effort, especially if we have so many VPN users.
 Secondly, not all regular users are knowledgeable enough to install a certificate on their device, which would mean that I would have to bring the device in to have the certificate installed. This could be a repetitive process because the certificate has a definite lifespan.
 Given these concerns, I wanted to ask the community: what is the best way to restrict SSL VPN access to specific devices while avoiding the downsides of cert-based VPN? Are there any alternative methods or best practices that I should consider? 
 Any insights or recommendations would be appreciated.

                              <span>As I am a storage/vmware admin at my current role and our network team is looking into moving away from our current network setup. We are currently using Xtreme switches and core and moving on the Fabric. 
 While my SAN switches are now not routed over the core and are different from my TOR switches. My 4 SAN switches are running standalone, 2 in each datacenter connected to each other. 
 Now with Fabric incomming our network team want to use the same switch for TOR and SAN network both routed over the core, is this a good idea ? 
 Currently i&#x27;m running a test cluster with a vmware host connected to 2 frabric switches for TOR &amp; SAN and that traffic is running over our old core X8 back to our old SAN switch and our storage appliances. What I am seeing atm is there are only a few test VM&#x27;s running on that host, but the latency is high. I wonder if this setup is a good idea or if it&#x27;s better to keep SAN completaly seperated from the other traffic like it is in our current setup.

                              <span>This just came up while configuring a new NAC deployment.
 Fairly common scenario that I&#x27;ve not thought through before. You have your relay agents (whatever they are) configured with a pair of dhcp servers to cover your ass. When the relay agent receives a request, does it forward to both, round robin, or some sort of stateful decision tree? Just finished reading rfc 1542 (best, most detailed description I could find) and I&#x27;m no better informed on the topic.
 At this point, I&#x27;d love to throw together a lab and experimentally check what a dozen different devices do, but have a few too many projects I&#x27;m behind on. Anybody already done this legwork?
 Whole question is because I stumbled upon instructions to setup the NAC mgmt port as an additional relay target and it will passively sniff for DHCP fingerprinting. Obviously clients get DHCP either way, just with more delays if there&#x27;s some form of load balancing. But RR would mean fingerprinting is inconsistent across devices.

                              <span>Fellow Networkers, 
 I’m looking for advice. Our 7K’s have many VRFs, SVI’s and PortChannels configured. What is the least impactful method on how to migrate VPC’s, L3 uplinks, and SVI’s? Our 7Ks are advertising with OSPF with a floating static route as a backup. We can’t afford downtime during the migration.

 I have my Bachelors and a CCIE:Routing and Switching and about 10 years of Network Engineering experience but I think my hold up for teaching at a university is that I do not have my masters degree. This is for jobs in the US.

                              <span>I used to love running cEOS in GNS3 because it gave me a Cisco-like CLI + MCLAG while also being more lightweight and less throughput constrained than Arista&#x27;s vEOS. 
 Recently I&#x27;ve moved to EVE-NG as my platform of choice, and it&#x27;s great, except I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to start a docker container with (1) startup commands and (2) environment variables, both of which are required to run a containerized EOS. The EVE-NG team has not given much support on this subject, so I here I am asking you fine folks for help.
 Has anyone here gotten cEOS and/or custom docker images to run in EVE-NG?
 EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted? If you do a search on the subject you&#x27;ll find that there is only ONE resource talking about how to run custom docker images on EVE-NG, but that is using docker-in-docker, which I want to avoid due to the performance tax. (The whole reason I&#x27;m using cEOS is to get better performance...). Plus the use-case for docker-in-docker is much more complex than starting a container with simple environmental variables.

                              <span>Hi!
 I installed an ER8411 VPN router in our office and I configured an IPsec VPN. My client device is a Windows 10 PC on another network. It connects to the VPN using TheGreenBow.
 I get good speeds, around 70 MB/s for file transfer, which is good for me.
 The problem I have is weird, and probably something I don&#x27;t know. When I try copying a file from any remote device to my local client, it will allocate the client&#x27;s ram for the size of that file. If I start a 5GB file copy, quickly the Ram usage will ramp up by 5GB. I need to transfer 60GB files, so that&#x27;s a big issue. Once the transfer is done, it DOES NOT free the ram...
 I do not have that problem if I launch a copy from another drive or a local NAS.
 Any idea or explaination?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 Was wondering if someone can provide an example of how to configure MEC on a Cisco C9500 that is configured in a StackWise Virtual Link, please? 
 For example: 
 In Arista, they use MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation). I know how to configure MLAG in the Arista using Port Channel and MLAG configuration. To do so, I select the interface, for example, interface ethernet 2, under that interface, then I create the “channel-group 20“ with the number and mode. Then I move to the interface “port-channel 20”, and associate that port channel with the mlag number (let’s say 20 as well). I&#x27;ll do the same on the second switch so both switches know they are part of an LACP/Port-Channel with MLAG connection in case switch one goes down. 
 Just need to know how I would configure MEC on the Cisco C9500 in a Stackwise Virtual mode.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am running into an issue at work that I am unable to figure out and I was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on to what might be happening.
 I have a device on my facility floor that is using a Static IP of:
 10.239.134.177
 255.255.255.0
 10.239.134.1
 The DNS servers are set correctly as well.
 When I run an ipconfig /all
 I get 2x IPv4 Addresses:
 10.239.134.177 (Preferred)
 255.255.255.0
 Then I also get a second IPv4 Address:
 10.255.255.241 (Preferred)
 255.0.0.0
 It is causing issues on my network because the second address seems to be taking priority.
 When I reboot the machine it only shows 1 address, but after about 15 mins the network icon in the taskbar gets a yellow triangle saying (no internet) and when you run the ipconfig /all you see the second IP has come back.
 The device does have 2 NIC&#x27;s but one of them is disabled and we are only using one.

 This is a link to the screenshot of the ipconfig.
 Thank you for any help you can provide.

I&#x27;ve done a few searches here, and also online, for a like replacement that comes in under $1000, and can&#x27;t seem to find anything... I need a unit that does: - RJ45 cable testing - Remote mapping - Cable length measurement - Link testing (PoE voltage, speed/duplex, polarity) - LLDP/CDP port ID - Ping testing with user-entered IP/gateway info
 It seems the NT800 is not sold any longer :( Any units out there that do the above at a sub-$1K price point?

                              <span>I encountered something funny today. In the far far dark corners of our network with gigabit switches cat 6 a whole domain and all the fun stuff, crammed in an old dusty panel was a Netgear EN104TP 10baseT hub sitting there serving a single computer, plc, and some industrial hardware. 
 I am by no means a network professional but this has me curious. Could a hub cause problems for the rest of a network if used at its extreme reach, or is it ok so long as it doesn&#x27;t cause problems among the devices it serves?

                              <span>Cisco switches in a school, we&#x27;ve got a port downstairs that is on the wrong vlan, but I can&#x27;t find which switch and port in the MDF it connects to (previous admin set vlan by switch port as far as I can tell, but didn&#x27;t label the patch panels or leave any documentation). I&#x27;ve tried show mac address-table on each one and see nothing. At this point I&#x27;ve connected a laptop downstairs that&#x27;s on a continual ping so I know it has connectivity on the port, but I can&#x27;t find the mac address for that laptop. Catalyst switches, mix of models. Any help appreciated, as a ton of small children are due to arrive any moment and make this job a lot more difficult.
 Edit: Issue resolved. Thanks everyone who responded. I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the last you&#x27;ll see of me, hopefully next time with smarter questions than I had today.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a BGP routing solution for a multihoming site which would automatically do traffic engineering based on set of pre-configured rules. Specifically I&#x27;m looking on measuring latency and download/uploads speed of certain IPs, hosts and web urls, such as Amazon S3 buckets.
 I know that I can adjust manually things like local weights and preferences for outgoing traffic and to influence incoming traffic with AS route prefixing and announcing smaller prefixes to some of the transit peers, but I would want to automate this.
 Do anybody know any such product?

I started researching and listening to podcasts about it. It seems a lot of people see this as the future especially since 5g, and the cloud is becoming more and more relevant in our lives today. Just wanted to see if any network engineers or anyone who understands software defined networking had an opinions on this.

 Does anyone have any recommendations of a good local telecoms provider in LA that can help me get this sorted, and potentially provide some basic remote support for times when technical team members are not on-site?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ve been working in an engineering team for a few years now (ISP). Mostly phasing out older stuff, helping out our SD teams and working on incidents that occurred. Also we&#x27;re occasionally involved with on-boarding new clients, fitting their needs. And other projects (think: new PoPs etc).
 Honestly, it kinda feels &#x27;stale&#x27;. I like to play new shiny stuff once in a while. play around with it, see if it fits our use. For example software/tooling for QoL, other hardware, else. 
 Reflecting on other engineering teams in other branches e.g. motorsports; they have engineers with a clear goal: win a race within certain rules. I don&#x27;t think we (as NWE&#x27;s) always have these clear rules. There is -however- one clear goal: it has to work. It mostly does not matter how (no clear rules).
 How would one create some kind of &#x27;race&#x27; to squeeze every bit from a router. Having no jitter, or making sure you lose no packets in transit? Otherwise, i don&#x27;t really feel being an engineer but more like a janitor.

 I want to hear about some real world use cases which this can be applied. 
 Please share helpful web resources, if any. Thanks

                              <span>Are there any cheaper/smaller firewall appliances that can do greater than 1Gb to 10Gb firewall throughput that don&#x27;t have a lot of extra features. I don&#x27;t need more than 2x SFP+ ports, don&#x27;t need VPN capability. 
 I&#x27;ve tried looking at all the big names and they either have models that have all 1G ports or have ones that have way more 10G ports and features than I would need and can afford.
 The only options I&#x27;ve found so far is NetGate TNSR appliances, or Ubiquiti ER-8-XG-US.
 Edit: Cheaper would be &lt;$10k USD or around that target.

 I&#x27;m not sure how or why IT became the &quot;hey you know how to do computers so why don&#x27;t you fix the fridge on your downtime&quot; role but absolutely and with certainty fuck all of that noise. Stand up for yourselves and stop letting douchebags tell you how to perform, what to do and do things that aren&#x27;t in your job description. 
 It&#x27;s amazing how many people bend over backwards, skip lunch and drive themselves up a wall for selfish assholes who don&#x27;t give a single fuck about you or your mental wellbeing. Put your phone on DND, eat lunch and make people wait. Stop being a pushover pussy and you won&#x27;t have to come to reddit to vent and hate everyone every morning at 9AM. 
 Have some self respect and stop self loathing. Our jobs are difficult enough. You don&#x27;t need to hate your position because you don&#x27;t have enough self respect to stand up to people and tell them to fuck off very nicely.

                              <span>Obligatory sorry for grammar/punctuation as I am on mobile.
 I put up a post over a year ago complaining about policy and management at my job, you can view on my profile. TLDR of that post was management was changing policy flip flopping back and forth and making our jobs harder because of it.
 I spent a lot of time at the old place complaining, and wallowing in my self pity. Thinking that I wasnt good enough and that there was no way another company would hire me. I blamed management for my unhappiness which is partially true but in the end it was my fault for staying and letting them make me unhappy.
 On the flip side yesterday I had my 6 month review at my new job that went spectacular. I found a place that is supportive and listens to employees to improve the company. It&#x27;s not perfect by any means but no where really is. Since I&#x27;ve been here my mental health has improved, I&#x27;ve been eating better and I&#x27;ve lost ~60lbs. I&#x27;m learning more than ever and have the ability to move up in the company.
 Please remember that no job is worth your health. If you are not happy or your health, both physical or mental is declining, leaving is better than staying. Yes I&#x27;m aware that is easier said than done it took me almost 10 months to decide and actively look for another job but it worked out in the end.

                              <span>We’re a smaller team, our manager left last year and someone was brought in but ultimately didn’t work out.
 This time I put my name in the hat as did another coworker (he applied the first time as well but was passed up.)
 I met with our CTO today and was told that the organization was going with the coworker over me, essentially because of seniority even though I’d be a better fit.
 This is a guy who
  
Calls people on their days off because he’s too lazy to spend five minutes looking for an answer
 Has to be told/shown multiple times to do something (I’m starting to wonder if he can read and write)
 Does nothing to improve things and does not work smart
 Won’t take ownership of stuff and will try anything to push work off to others or weasel out of it
 Staff outside our main office specifically complain about him
  
What’s worse is I was given permission from our other coworkers on the team to use as a reference as well as a respected manager outside our group. I don’t believe he had any. While I haven’t seen his resume, I don’t believe he’s the better qualified candidate (other than being in IT longer.)
 The boss says the decision was not his and leadership/hr overruled him.
 I may give it a few months to see how things pan out but I’ll likely leave if I can find an employer who’ll match or beat my benefits.

 It seems like a waste of time having to answer IT questions through Teams chat when we can just find the answers quickly ourselves ya? Currently stuck with a minimal helpdesk system without any of these kinds of features.

 This malware can bypass all boot protection on any Windows Box but it needs to run as admin to do so.
 Once a devices is infected it is really hard to remove. The malware infects the bootloader and runs in kernel land.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a couple of polls lately with no-code options and would love to see how this sub feels about using or trialling one.
 I think for me I would be very skeptical but assuming &quot;it&quot; could do everything I needed and worked out more efficient, then I&#x27;d be very interested.
 I&#x27;d be especially interested in what people think a no-code solution wouldn&#x27;t be able to do...

                              <span>Hi all. Just started working remotely for a sensitive financial institution. They provided me a laptop and said I cannot use any of my home monitors to attach to it as it’s a security risk. I never heard of this before. Any truth to this? Anyone aware of what the risk might be? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>It&#x27;s 2:58 pm, I haven&#x27;t had a break.. 
 The phone keeps ringing off the hook, and my half eaten Wendy&#x27;s cheeseburger sits hardening on my desk. 
 I am paid 1/4 of what the people I&#x27;m helping are making, yet I am expected to know the inner workings of every software or complicated piece of equipment that they rely on.
 Ironically it is them who are allowed to slack off and complain to no end when something doesn&#x27;t go their way.
 Every day there is another self important asshole who thinks their job is more important than everyone else&#x27;s.
 Ironically, it is these same &quot;overworked&quot; and &quot;stressed out&quot; individuals whom I see heading to the cafeteria 10+ times a day, when I haven&#x27;t finished my lunch in a week.
 I am only one man to 600 tech inept employees. 
 My question is, why is there no computer competency test for positions that are paying $100k + a year?? What is this absolute bullshit.
 Would you hire a carpenter who doesn&#x27;t know how to hold a hammer?
 It&#x27;s twenty twenty fucking 3 is it not?
 Rant over.

                              <span>Starting yesterday, most (dozens) of my Windows Server (2016 /2019/2022) have been failing to apply Defender definition updates. In the Defender event logs, I get this:
 Microsoft Defender Antivirus has encountered an error trying to update security intelligence. New security intelligence Version: 1.383.1379.0 Previous security intelligence Version: Update Source: User Security intelligence Type: AntiSpyware Update Type: Full User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Current Engine Version: 1.1.20000.2 Previous Engine Version: Error code: 0x80508007 Error description: Your device is low on memory. Close some programs and try again, or search Help and Support for information about preventing low memory problems. 
 Tried numerous ways to get them to install (MPCMDRUN commands, downloading the direct installer from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates, etc.). Always ends up with the same 80508007. None of these servers (mix of physical and VM) are low on memory or any other resources. The last successful update version was 1.383.1289.0 (from 3/8/2023).
 Is anyone else seeing any issues like this?

 For context remote users use SonicWall VPN and my experience is the fastest fix is a simple reboot. Emailed instructions; will send texts if asked; I will even take a phone call and politely explain to reboot. &quot;Hey just reboot and your issue will be solved. This thing just hangs up from time to time.&quot;
 After a few minutes The number of times I hear the words &quot;Did that; same error&quot; only to find their uptime being over a day is increasingly annoying. 
 This feels new and I think people are getting dumber and lazier. Been in IT 20+ years and I thought we&#x27;d be passed this.
 For those young sysadmins feeling like you wont be needed in 20 years because people will know technology. I can safely say YOU&#x27;RE SAFE!

 No idea if other countries do this but in the UK its common for kids (age 15-17) before they go to college to do a week or two of &#x27;work experience&#x27; .
 Anyway, this kid is coming here as he wants to get into IT and/or Dev so he&#x27;s spending 2 days with our software engineers, 2 days with our test equipment design team (we&#x27;re a manufacturing facility) and he&#x27;s with me for one day on Monday. He gets to rate the experience so naturally there is some friendly competition amongst us as to which was more interesting, and I only get one day.
 ​
 What the hell do I trust a 16 year old child with that:
 - is engaging and not intensely boring
 - shows a good overview of what working in an &#x27;IT&#x27; support/ops environment is like
 - can be explained quickly as time is limited
 - doesn&#x27;t involve giving him the keys to the kingdom or other such compliance nightmares
 - doesn&#x27;t involve me talking at him for 8 hours.
 - can be done in production because I&#x27;m not in tomorrow, only found out about this on Monday and haven&#x27;t had time to set up any kind of lab he can happily break

 ​
 I have a lot of experience with Fortinet, and their quality flat out sucks. Apply a fix... break another thing. Apply a fix to that... break another thing... and so on.... Oh.. and &quot;we didn&#x27;t fix the issue in this major version line.. upgrade to the next major version to get the fix.&quot; Seems like it has gotten worse over the last year or two, to be honest.
 ​
 Looking for opinions from folks who have experience with both vendors.

                              <span>We are setting up a new HP server using RAID 1 for x2 OS drives and RAID 10 for x8 Data Drives.
 As it stands the OS drives are in slots 1 and 2, with the rest being allocated to data.
 When I go to create the Logical Drives using Intelligent Provisioning, I can see that, there are 4 drives allocated to Port 1 on the RAID controller, 4 drives allocated to Port 2 on the RAID controller, and 2 drives connected to Port 3 on the RAID controller.
 The issue is that the x2 OS drives are intermixed with the x8 drives and not separated under port 3 for the expansion bay. Does it matter which drives are connected to which ports on the RAID controller? Or should I just be able to cut up into logical drives no matter where the drives are plugged in?
 Edit: and also from a sysadmin perspective, what would be the least confusing configuration for this setup. To have the OS drives in bays 1 and 2, or have them in the last slots 9 and 10 and be in the expansion bay.

                              <span>Hi, 
 We are 3 people rotating on-call during weekends.
 User 1 - Week 1
 User 2 - Week 2
 User 3 - Week 3
 User 1- Week 4
 etc. 
 But i can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to add on-call that&#x27;s reoccurring every n weeks for each user.
 As it is now i have to update the schedule every 3 weeks, since i can only figure out how to add on-call for one specific weekend by adding it with dates.
 See the picture here for how i&#x27;ve done it so far.
 Thanks!

The usual steps to fix it seem to be working, but I need to find out what&#x27;s causing it all of a sudden. It seems to be different people at different times over the last 2 weeks. Is there any way to find out what might be causing this error? When it happens they can&#x27;t sign into any office or outlook apps and clearing credential manager seems to fix it. But our queue is getting filled with new users having this problem all of sudden and it&#x27;s taking up time to fix each user.

 Do you use some tool, software, or anything to have all your notifications from each different app, in just one place, one control panel? (Desktop) (Like a mail client, but for all apps like whatsapp, messenger, discord, reddit, email, github, etc etc..)

This sends our customers an email saying &quot;this email was deleted and not read&quot;. 
 Is there a way to stop this? We have disabled &quot;Read Receipts&quot; in outlook web, but the emails still happen. Apparently &quot;Read Receipts&quot; are not the same as &quot;Not Read Receipts&quot;.

 We have a Sharp BP-70C45
 ​
 And Odd thing is happening. We have MS365
 I have setup scan to email with smtp auth(Option1)
 I cannot use Direct Send(Option2) as it need to go to external recipeints as well
 I cannot use SMTP Relay(Option3) as it is a dynamic IP, I tried but it fails/does not work, even if I put the dynip on the sfp and connector
 ​
 So what is happening is I cannot scan to email to multiple recipients in my domain
 ie ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com)) it gives me a time out error on the printer
 ​
 I can send to a single recipient in my domain ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 I can send to multiple external recipients to any external domain([userext1@ext1.com](mailto:userext1@ext1.com), [user2@extother2.com](mailto:user2@extother2.com))
 ​
 But if I try to send to multiple users in my domain ie([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com))
 it will give me a timeout error on the printer 
 OR 
 If I try to send to a mix of external([user1@somedomain.com](mailto:user1@somedomain.com)) and internal([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 It will send to the external but will give a timeout error for the internal. 
 ​
 So not sure if its something with the printer or MS365, anyone seen something like this before

                              <span>Hey All,
 Just looking for some advice. I have been looking at creating an internal Ansible infrastructure from scratch for our small team. The master server setup and inventory is quite easy and the box is easily screwed down re: the security as far as OS and access for certain groups, correct access rights, logging, locked down firewalls as well. You know, the sane usual settings.
 One thing that really worries me is the fact that in order to use the Ansible setup properly we are going to have to create keys that have no password, are exempted from 2FA rules and can switch to root level access. 
 The information on these servers &quot;is the business&quot; so if our data got lost it would be the end of the business if that makes sense. If the box got compromised it would be game over.
 In order to get the key they would have to exploit some creds to get into the box but its the sheer lateral movement/access that is gotten if these keys are misappropriated that worries me.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hey guys!
 ​
 This whole Exchange Online / Hybrid-Configuration topic has been bugging me for a long time now. I hope someone might be able to help me.
 ​
 Following scenario: We have a Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online and an on-prem Active Directory (NO AD Connect). So at the moment we always have to create two users: one for the M365 tenant / Exchange Online and one user for the on-prem AD.
 ​
 Is it possible to merge the on-prem AD users with the M365 users? I did find some tutorials on how to configure Azure AD Connect using soft and hard matching. BUT: I also read on some forum, that you must have an on-prem exchange in order for it to work properly (no further information was given). This on-prem Exchange is just used for communication between Exchange Online and the on-prem environment (no mailboxes etc. needed). How do I have to configure that on-prem Exchange? Just install it, configure hybrid mode and start creating users withing on-prem Exchange? Do I have to license the on-prem Exchange?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Just wanted to give a headsup about this issue. We got two brand new Lenovo SR630 V2 servers with Broadcom 57414 NICs. Installed Lenovo ESXi 7.0.3 image from Lenovo site, see that the 1gb NICs show up in VmWare but 10gb nics 57414 don&#x27;t show up. Troubleshooted half a day, installed latest firmware but nothing. Device itself is visible in esxi cli but not when calling esxcli nic command.
 Finally found theres an issue about it: https://datacentersupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/servers/thinksystem/sr630v2/7z71/solutions/tt1001-broadcom-57454-ocp-and-57414-ocp-nics-do-not-appear-in-uefi-after-flashing-fw-to-222173
 Downgrading the firmware back to 219.0.29.0 and then the nics showed up in VmWare
 Quite a big problem if server is unusable out of box and promised fix is coming by the end on April.

                              <span>Hi !
 I don&#x27;t know if the community of r/sysadmin might help with my issue, see it as a message in a bottle and mods feel free to delete if it doesn&#x27;t fit this sub requirements! 
 I&#x27;m having huge trouble with a OOM issue when running MariaDB :
 - Server specs : https://pastebin.com/qXCbBWLM
 - InnoDB Status : https://pastebin.com/p9aNVWqT
 - MySQLTuner report: https://pastebin.com/xfvVt1Nv
 The main issue is that even though MariaDB is allocated 20Gb for &#x27;innodb_buffer_pool_size&#x27;, it goes way up in memory consumption leading to this graph :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5hxodSj)
 As we can see in this graph, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to an activity spike :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/Y12CECY)
 And if we take a look at the buffer size (the issue started when the &#x27;lowered&#x27; was 1Gb so we went for 24Gb and lowered it to 20Gb) :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5hxodSj)
 I already tried to tweak some MariaDB configurations but struggle to find the culprit of this OOM issue. There is only MariaDB running on this server and the kernel log file shows me that only MariaDB is consuming RAM when the OOM occurs.
 Is this only an issue of too low RAM to run this database ?
 Any help is welcome and if I can provide any other information just ask, I&#x27;m getting reallllyyyy desperate ! Thank you for your reading and have a good day !

 I know that the client resolver on W10 switches to the second DNS server after trying and failing with the first server for 1 second. But when does it switch back? I know it does after a restart, but what about during regular operation? From my findings, Windows doesn&#x27;t &quot;balance&quot; between servers. It sticks with the first one until the 1 second timeout.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have an on Prem AD server which sync&#x27;s out users to AAD using Azure AD Connect.
 Recently the On Prem AD server went pop which obviously has stopped the sync. My plan over the course of the next month was to Fully migrate away from the on Prem server anyway as there is no need for it any more. All of our Microsoft services are cloud based. We have no on site applications. All machines are connected via Azure and linked up to intune. So really all we use the on Prem server for is creating accounts. 
 My question is... What would the implications be of just leaving the server in its current state seeing as though I was going to be getting rid of it anyway. Do the current users get converted to Cloud users automatically 
 ...or is it advisable to restore from backups and carry out the steps of stopping syncs at both ends etc.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 Im currently trying to add servers of differents domains in the server manager.
 I&#x27;ve added them by ip, then I&#x27;ve used the &quot;Manage As&quot; button to specify domain information.
 Eveything is working fine and all the informations about the server display (services, logs etc).
 But when I close the server manager and reopen it, the informations are gone and I have to click on &quot;Manage As&quot; on each server, to specify domain information again.
 Is there a way for the domain information to stay veen when i restart the server manager ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been working as a sysadmin for a couple of years now and I work at a company that has 500+ people working, not a small company, not a huge either.
 Our CIO left the company and the process to find a new one just finished and they landed with a CIO with 20+ years of experience in the field, after a few talks with the new CIO and he seems to have a lot of knowledge.
 My only issue is that he decided to change our entire OS infrastructure, from Windows to ChromeOS. I&#x27;ve asked him why the change, he said &quot;ChromeOS is more secure and faster&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve never used ChromeOS, so I don&#x27;t know what to expect on it. 
 I&#x27;m half tempted to learn the OS to improve my skills and knowledge, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t wanna waste time learning something that I might not use much in the future if I change jobs or he leaves (the previous company where he worked started the transition back to windows after he left, the employees weren&#x27;t happy with ChromeOS). 
 What do you guys think on this transition and what would you do in my shoes?

 We have a remote desktop but one piece of software is not compatible with it (I know ... why did they buy it.. )
 Portnox also authenticates users to connect too the on-site WiFi, if this solution could also authenticate end users to use on site WiFi that would be a plus!

                              <span>Hi everyone, this will be a long post, so bear with me.
 The issue started a couple of years ago, where an employee bought an Surface Book 2 with Win 10 Pro, x64 for daily work. Everything went smoothly at the beginning. The user could access the on premise file shares and work with all the company files, also the transition from the company network to the internet and access via VPN and so on, almost everything was running fine.
 The only exception was one particular vm Win Server 2019 on which a CRM was running and presenting a smb share to the users, from which they could start the applications. This software is designed, that everything can run directly from the server, you only have to have access to the network share and start the application.
 And with this Surface device, the issue…</span>

 ​
 I need to run a script, when a user does disconnect and reconnect to his/her RDP session on Windows 2022.
 ​
 What I tried is, to do this with a task manager job:
 If there is a new event 25 in Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational
 --&gt; Extract the &quot;User&quot; variable and start a script
 ​
  Event/UserData/EventXML[@Name&#x3D;&quot;User&quot;]  
 and then:
 -File C:\Batch\test.ps1 -TargetUsername &quot;$(User)&quot; 
 ...but the variable is always empty.
 I also tried &quot;%username%&quot; but this one is always filled with one special user (I do not know, why) and not with the &quot;reconnecting&quot; user.
 ​
 Can you give me a hint on how to solve this?
 ​
 Thank you and best wishes

                              <span>Good morning,
 a quick question... currently we are thiking to use the Lansweeper agent to retrieve the system configuration of various PC outside the domain.
 We have already an inventory and I am able to format that inventory according to the Lansweeper import format.
 I haven&#x27;t yet tested it but according to the search I did, I will not able to sync the item on the inventory with the information retrieved by the agent deployed on the same PC.
 Am I in the right?
 Is it avaiable if so any workaround?
 ​
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am not sure if this is the right sub but let me try. I work in accounting (EU) and every month i have to send 3-4 seperate files to 120+ different clients. The files are always saved in a folder named 01_jan, 02_feb ect. The content of the mail is always the same for every customer except the name. Is there any program out there that can automate this or even just a par of it? Do you have recomendations?
 Best Regards.

                              <span>I am dealing with a fairly large Nutanix infrastructure 40+ nodes across several clusters and locations. We use it like you you would use a vmware or any other hypervisor to just run VMs. Nothing special no fancy services or scripting. 
 When I say every single upgrade I have done has failed or taken 8+ hours for something that should be 2 at the most, I mean every single upgrade. I can&#x27;t find a single redeeming quality to this system. Every issue requires SSH access to the controller VMs, and either a pile of CLI or direct intervention from their support staff. In a 10+ year career I&#x27;ve never talked to support so much in such a short amount of time. Every firmware upgrade of the underlying host turns into a multi hour nightmare with crazy 2+ hour timeouts before a failure message. Every single feature down to what should be the simplest thing is manual, or a ratking of python scripts behind a sleek UI with bad progress reporting. Something as easy as upgrading the VM guest tools is a manual process with no automation. 
 I don&#x27;t understand, what&#x27;s the value add? How is this company maintaining customers?

But I want to think outside the box a bit; can we put some more safeguards on exactly who can encrypt data? Can we wholesale disallow via GPO the use of encryption on the OS? Can the OS/Admin have a system-wide &quot;skeleton key&quot; that can decrypt data regardless of encryption keys used? It can&#x27;t just be about backups and malware prevention, cybersecurity needs to neutralize the threat itself, to de-fang encryption-abuse. Is anybody in cybersecurity thinking along these lines?

I know my way around PowerShell well enough to create advanced functions and make basic graphical interfaces for my scripts. Would like to expand my horizons and learn to automate everything I have learned to automate in PowerShell in Python. Any recommendation on courses or books?

                              <span>Preface: Inherited setup
 We are a smallish organisation with 20 sites + 1 Datacenter headend all on MPLS. We currently have all the backup IPSec tunnels terminating on the core router (network core and MPLS headend) in the DC but I am looking to move the tunnels to a new/repurposed router to avoid SPOF.
 We have onprem (Datacenter) domain controllers and Office365/Azure AD in a hybrid setup.
 Hardware:
 Core router - Juniper SRX4600 in HA
 Repurposed Router - Juniper SRX1500 in HA
 The SRX4600 is beastly enough to handle the existing and future tunnels but I am just looking at a cleaner way to tie everything in. FYI - We are in locked in for a further 3 years with our MPLS provider.
 What is everyone doing nowadays with backup tunnels (besides ditching MPLS altogether for SDWAN and SASE/CASB :))

                              <span>A question for the ios-xr users out there - 
 cut over to a new firewall and moved the L3 interfaces from the router to the firewall behind a transit vlan 
 Prior to the cutover the interfaces were all being advertised out on bgp using network statement and route policy. Upon moving the interface to the firewall it appears that the router is no longer advertising those subnets into the BGP peering. Why could this be?
 Changes made: Transit subnet/interfaces created on router Static routes added to point routers to new location of the subnets Old interfaces deleted
 Troubleshooting: Pings to otherside of transit interface - pass Routes in local table - pass Advertised routes - fail 
 Please ask away If you need more info

                              <span>Long time lurker and first time poster. Thought I would cross post this from the K12 page just to see what insight you all could provide too.
 Looking into new wireless hardware for this next fall for my district. I feel like reviews are all over the place... I&#x27;m hoping maybe you all can share your experience and advice on what has worked best for your district.
 We are a small district. Two buildings with 1200 students and 200 staff. Our environment is somewhat mixed. Students are 1to1 iPad, staff are 1to1 Mac Air, Chromebooks for assistants, and office staff have windows desktops.
 We are currently running 3 year old Aruba switches and 2 year old Unifi AC HD AP&#x27;s. While I really haven&#x27;t had many issues with the AP&#x27;s, used Unifi in other districts and businesses for the last 8 years, I&#x27;m concerned UBNT may not be as focused as they use to be on the networking end.
 I&#x27;m considering staying with Unifi and purchasing U6 Enterprise AP&#x27;s. Testing with them so far has gone well in classroom.
 But, I&#x27;ve also been considering Ruckus, Extreme or maybe Aruba based on bids I&#x27;ve received (I don&#x27;t have any experience with any of those 3) I have had Meraki and I&#x27;m not a fan of the Meraki licensing model or hardware.
 Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I am looking for at least 4 cassettes in 1U. 4 is fine.
 I could do FS but rather not. I&#x27;m looking at LanShack as they have it in stock and can get me 2 panels with 2 cassettes each quick enough.
 I normally use Panduit Opticom units (FMD1/2) with their cassettes. It&#x27;s about ten times the price almost compared to LanShack. Panduit stock is really slim at the moment anywhere I look. 
 Never used LanShack before. Anyone used their cassettes? Are they reliable?

The problem is that every time I connect via AnyConnect to xxx.com (for example) it pops up a window for me to validate the VPN downloader plugin. Is there any way I can disable this? Is this an inherent part of connecting to Remote VPN? Interestingly, the VPN downloader is only initiated if I connect to xxx.com. On the other hand, if I connect to yyy.com, the window to accept the VPN downloader does not pop up for me.

 I&#x27;m curious to know how other organizations handle this issue. Who takes charge of the cameras and NVRs in your workplace?

                              <span>We have been experiencing a strange DHCP issue the last few days. We are using Juniper Ex4300s as an L3 gateway, with UniFi access switching and wireless.
 Clients will send DHCP Discover to the router, which is then relayed to a Windows DHCP server. The server then sends an Offer, which is received by the client.
 This is where we run into issues. The client sends a DHCP Request, but the request never makes it to the Juniper gateway. This is mostly affecting our WiFi, so I am thinking it is the UniFi APs, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a resolution to this issue.
 DHCP Snooping is disabled. We have tested several different firmware versions on the APs, to no avail.
 EDIT: This is affecting wired clients as well.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve got a client with a Catalyst 3850 stack, running on some old ass code 3.6.3. (bad i know, they arent even under support by cisco either)
 ​
 The issue they&#x27;re having is ONLY the primary/master switch in the stack is functioning. All 3 other switches&#x27; interfaces aren&#x27;t working. All commands show the stack is functioning as normal however...
 &#x27;show switch&#x27; shows all switches are a part of the stack no problem.
 &#x27; show switch stack-ports&#x27; shows all is good with the stack cables
 Nothing in the logs is showing anything out of the ordinary, except for %SPI_FC-3-HIGH_WMARK_REACHED: Number of messages in the queue for channel 11 has reached maximum. Which i&#x27;m reading is a known bug on this code... shouldn&#x27;t be an issue with stacking.
 We&#x27;re able to reload all other switches individually with &#x27;reload slot x&#x27; command, and reloading all other switches (except for the primary, because we dont want to reload the working one during business hours) didn&#x27;t seems to fix it. After reloading the other member switches, they join back into the stack just fine. 
 ​
 The member switches&#x27; ports are simply just not coming up. It&#x27;s showing no link activity like there&#x27;s no cable even plugged in. Tried bouncing the ports, and unplugging/replugging in cables, no luck.
 ​
 Has anyone ever ran into this? The plan is to reboot the whole stack tonight after work hours to see if that fixes, which i&#x27;m hoping it does. It has an uptime of 2 years also.
 Any advice would be appreciated!!
 EDIT:: The reboot fixed it! Of course next step is to get them upgraded. Thanks for the responses.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We&#x27;ve had Cisco routers on order for over a year now and their ETA keeps getting pushed further out. I am wondering how prevalent different virtual router products such as VyOS, TNSR, or even CSR1K/CSR8K are in the enterprise non cloud environment for replacing traditional ethernet routers used for internet edge and private WAN connectivity. I understand there are some (very) large and small businesses that make use of them, but would like to understand how &quot;ready&quot; are they to replace traditional hardware-based internet/WAN routers? Most discussions around VyOS tend to be around home use rather than enterprise and VyOS/TNSR seem to be only occasionally mentioned in enterprise networking related discussions.
 Also, does anyone have experience with technical support for either? VyOS looks to be &lt; $20K per year for unlimited installs and 1-4Hr support SLA. I feel I&#x27;d have a better time convincing management to try a products other than Cisco if they can be assured that they have decent support. There also aren&#x27;t many concrete performance numbers published for VyOS but anecdotal evidence suggests that 10Gbps+ should be achievable even when hosted on ESXi. Are there any &quot;gotchas&quot; to look forward to with hosting any of these on ESXi as far as functionality, stability, and performance?
 Thank you all for taking the time to read this.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m suffering with speed client speed issues with one of our stacks of Dell5548 switches (5 members).
 This presents as speed tests (iperf to a server, another client on the same stack or to WAN) performing at 0Mbps-990Mbps (speed fluctuates massively per second per client).
 We have 2 10Gbps fibre uplinks from our core in a port-channel, I&#x27;ve tried shutting each of these in turn to see if its a link issue but obviously the issue persists on the stack itself so I don&#x27;t think its a link issue.
 The switches are stacked in &quot;Ring&quot; (port 1 on switch 1 to port 2 on switch 2, down to switch 5 where port 1 goes back to port 2 switch 1).
 I&#x27;ve tried enabling BDPUGuard on all non-trunk ports to no avail. Our core stack is our root bridge for RSTP. I&#x27;ve added (and then removed) portfast fro…</span>

We have a number of legacy industrial printers that do not support Wifi, but the area they&#x27;re in has no drops (additional drops aren&#x27;t an option).
 From my understanding I can configure H303 or H500 AP&#x27;s to join the wireless, then allow access via their built-in Ethernet ports. I&#x27;ve been googling around but am not finding much; can anyone point me in the right direction?

 We&#x27;re trying FS.com switches to fill this role (I also looked into Juniper, but their 8 port switches are still stupid expensive for this use) and they read like they have all the features and more than we&#x27;d need, at a very low price.
 Ok, so I&#x27;ve got the FS2800 series 8 port switch with 2 fiber uplinks. The CLI is reasonable and accessible via serial. I can define VLANs and trunking etc. All good.
 However, when plugged into our distribution switches on a tagged port, I cannot ping or ssh to the configured interface.
 Their documentation (as expected) isn&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;m just wondering if I&#x27;m …</span>

                              <span>We are in the process of combining multiple tenants one one physical network in an office location. Looking at dynamic VLANs as an option to simplify the networking setup. 
 Each org will have “private” resources (i.e. NAS) and also share a few “public” resources (i.e., printers). 
 First question — it’s a fairly small office. In total we’ll have less than 20 dynamic clients and we’re currently using a Meraki device. What hardware will I need to accomplish this? 
 Second — for shared resources (i.e., printers) what’s the easiest way to have a device span multiple vlans in this way?
 Anything other questions I should be asking?

                              <span>My boss recently has come across some access switches (3750x and 9200) that he noticed some differences across the configs. What is the best way to take a golden config and push out something that ensures all other switches have exactly the same config as the golden switch?
 We have Cisco Prime, not sure if that has a feature to do this. But I am also somewhat comfortable with python and ansible. I know with ansible, I have done ansible diff to find differences, just not sure how to go about enforcing changes based off that.
 Just trying to find an easier way than wiping all the switches and putting a new config on them.
 Thanks

 I have a ruijie smart switch. I have 3 internet connection. I wanna add this connections to vlan1 with a server. Server will connect this wan connections with virtual ip. Clients are connect to server as gateway but clients are in different vlan. They can&#x27;t access to server. How should i make vlan settings. 
 Server has one cable for connect to switch. For short I wanna create two vlans and one device can access both vlans.

Should I just reply to him and tell him I can&#x27;t do this or is it better that his boss knows he&#x27;s trying to get me to pretend I still work at the company by calling the merchant and letting them know to increase the limit of the online payment processor. Either way this blew my mind...

 However, other executables launch fine without this.
 What causes this?

 Any ideas how to alert Microsoft of this so they can evaluate and correct any issue and get themselves unlisted?

 imo the simpler the better. The problem with Manage is it&#x27;s so bloated with features I would never use, and I cannot use even if I wanted to because the permissions are completely jacked in our environment.

                              <span>If you need a very simple, basic way to send an email from a script, or app in user context use mailto:
 This avoids dealing with SMTP, or Outlook COM automation, and will work with whatever email client is installed.
 PowerShell version:
 Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web #create to, subject, body $EmailURL &#x3D; &quot;mailto:someone@example.com?subject&#x3D;test-subject&amp;body&#x3D;Hello world!&quot; #URL encode it $EmailURL &#x3D; [System.Web.HttpUtility]::UrlEncode($EmailURL) #URL will now look like this %22mailto%3Asomeone%40example.com%3Fsubject%3Dtest-subject%26body%3DHello%20world!%22 Start-Process $EmailURL 
 To make body formatting easier you can do something like this:
 $body &#x3D; @&quot; Hi, This mail is a reminder. Please confirm ASAP. Thanks &quot;@ 
 VBA version:
 EmailURL &#x3D; &quot;mailto:someone@example.com?subject&#x3D;test-subject&amp;body&#x3D;Hello world!&quot; EmailURL &#x3D; ENCODEURL(EmailURL) Application.FollowHyperlink EmailURL

 My situation
 Worked my way through the standard sysadmin role to now being more of an IT (project) management role.
 I work in an international organization with IT colleagues spread in lots of countries.
 I am working from HQ but mostly my role is supporting/managing local IT colleagues and to make their life easier.
 These local IT colleagues purchase hardware based on HQ recommendations mostly, albeit these are often not hard recommendations - in areas like accessories (keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.) there is a lot of flexibility on purchasing whatever fits the local organization best, although there are selected recommendations in some areas.
  
 We want to provide all IT colleagues with a repository of recommended hardware in all general categories.
 What would be the best way to go about doing that?
 Ideally it should:
 * Cover basic information for all relevant device models divided in categories (mouse, keyboard, etc.)
 * Provide reviews/insights from other local IT colleagues (e.g. 5-star rating, comments/reviews)
 * Include links to our recommended resellers for purchase
  
 We do have confluence and SharePoint available as tools.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience with SharePoint myself and I do know that confluence will struggle once you work with lots of information on a single page (especially tables) - which is bound to happen after some time of adding hardware to the list.
 Neither of these options (at least as far as I can tell) would provide an easy way of achieving the goal.
 We also have ServiceNow but I don&#x27;t think this use-case fits an ITSM solution.  
  
 Did any of you do something similar already?
 If yes, how did you do it?
  
 I appreciate any input you could share with me! :)

                              <span>Good morning!
 We have a Ricoh MFP that&#x27;s used to do the normal office stuff. Due to a move an a migration we had to change some back end accounts and now we can&#x27;t get the Scan to Email to work with Microsoft.
 It&#x27;s very puzzling. We have for sure narrowed it down to a Microsoft issue but it&#x27;s not an OU thing, it&#x27;s not MFA (it&#x27;s off for this account) we have the correct username and password and yet it&#x27;s still failing.
 Any troubleshooting ideas would be very welcome.

                              <span>Hey everyone. I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has seen this. 
 My company has a sever in each site for file share (among other things). The share structure is the same for each center, so are the permissions. I wrote a powershell script to build the share and add permissions. It works fine, the file structure is right, looking at the permissions, they look fine. 
 But the user don&#x27;t actually have permissions. They should, but when they try they get a permissions access denied. Doing the permissions manually it works fine. 
 Anyone have any idea why powershell permissions fail, but by hand does not?

                              <span>Good morning everyone. Can you give me some recommendations of software that can be used to automatically keep our network inventory up to date. It would need to be able to inventory servers (both Windows and Linux), switches (HP/Aruba), access points (Aruba), firewalls (Palo Alto), printers, and maybe a few other device types. This solution would need to be able to scan multiple subnets, and preferably filter out just the device types mentioned (for instance, I don&#x27;t need this tool to inventory desktops/laptops).
 As a bonus, does anyone know of any software that could scan web servers and keep an inventory of all websites hosted on those servers (we are a state agency, and host a LOT of websites)? This can be a separate solution from the above recommendations.
 Thanks for the help!

 I&#x27;m in northern Indiana, close to the Chicago area, FYI.

                              <span>I realize I’m preaching to the choir in a sense, but about once a week a director will come into the IT office for us to help him set up a Zoom meeting. It’s not that hard and doesn’t take a lot of time but it’s frustrating that he’s done this for weeks in a row and refuses to try to do it himself.
 I’ve walked him through it 5 times and he still has no idea how to even start. I suggested an aptitude test to my coworkers and they agreed, but one wasn’t put in place.
 What do you guys think? Should there be an aptitude test for management positions?

                              <span>I just graduated college a few months ago with an information systems type degree. I have an over hour long commute 1 way to work. Pay is good. I started full time a few months after graduation as a Sys Admin 1. I am terrified. I feel like I don&#x27;t know anything and ask too many questions to my team of less than 10 supporting almost 1000 with all sorts of MS365 and AD and SCCM things which I never heard about in school. I dont feel like I belong. There is so much I don&#x27;t know. I love PCs and I love hardware an I get along with most of the users and they like me. I just feel like I don&#x27;t belong. I am the youngest by about 10 years on my team with everyone being there for a long time and being pretty close. They have got me working with vulnerability management and it&#x27;s interesting but I feel like I don&#x27;t know enough to do much. I can look at the CVEs and find the KBs online but I don&#x27;t know where to go from there. I just feel like I am in way over my head. I don&#x27;t feel like I know enough or can do enough to really do much. I dont know what to do. I don&#x27;t even know if this post is appropriate but I don&#x27;t know anyone else who understands and I don&#x27;t want to talk to anyone at work about it. I feel like it would only lead to bad things if I went to a coworker and was like &quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing and I am extremely nervous about my job. I just want to do well.&quot; There really hasn&#x27;t been any training mainly just 5 minute crash courses do this do that click this. Then left to my own. I am absolutely terrified of fucking this up. I got such a good job with amazing pay and benefits out the gate and I feel like I don&#x27;t fit. Thanks for reading.

 Does anyone have any experience with docking stations that work? I&#x27;m going crazy trying to find a proper docking station that works reliably.. 
 I&#x27;ve tried so many different devices, all kinds of Lenovo to Iiglo to belkin. I just purchased a Lenovo 32&quot; monitor with built in docking and it works great, but it doesn&#x27;t have an ethernet port or any display output for daisy chaining several screens which is a big minus.

 currently i&#x27;m trying to set up the connection to multiple NFS-Shares on the same Server (This setup is non-negotiatible)
 First i set up the connection to 1 NFS-Share which worked fine after some tweaking. A part of this journey was to create 2 keys in
 HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default
 The keys are &quot;AnonymousUID&quot; and &quot;AnonymousGID&quot;.
 Now the Problem is that with a different NFS-Share i will have different GID&#x27;s, but regedit doesnt allow a second key with the same name.
 How i can i make this work with 2 different GID-values?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to connect 4 different iscsi targets provided by a NAS with powershell. I don&#x27;t want to connect them all at once but rather separately, one at a time (first target1, then target2 and so on).
 So far I&#x27;ve had success geting the target names with get-iscsitarget and piping this to a select-string which then chooses the target I want to connect (target1 for the first target). I then pipe that to connect-iscsitarget but here&#x27;s my problem: This will assign the first available driveletter to the target. I want to assign specific letters, for example target1 gets W:, target2 gets X: and so on).
 But I cannot for the life of me find the command needed for this. All I can find is how to get driveletters from already connected targets and similat stuff.
 Any ideas? Am I missing something here?
 Thanks and have a good one!

                              <span>Hi,
 I was wondering if AD CS has an option to revoke an old certificate if a computer requests a new computer certificate.
 We have several machines who are getting rebuild every week which request a certificate with our CA. I would like to have the certificates which got request before the client got re-installed to be revoked, but I dont see any option which allows me to do this.
 Does anyone know if this is an option within AD CS?

                              <span>Hi All
 Yesterday we had an alert from Microsoft 365 Defender (our Licenses are on 365 E5) notifying us of “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected “. Yikes!
 To cut a long story short, our security stack has contained the threat and the single device in question is nuked – We looped in 3rd party security to sense check everything.
 The threat was a Gootloader infection and Google suggests this is particularly nasty and sophisticated. The payload is a zip file with a .js file inside and from our investigation, the .js script needs to be executed, launched via WScriptexe. We implement best practice in our IT stack and are on-top of hardening our environment where ever possible. In this instance the payload was downloaded to a temp directory where Applocker blocks execution. But had the zip/.js file been downloaded to the desktop, it would have potentially executed.
 1 suggested rudimentary mitigation for this is to change the file association of .js files (via Group Policy) to open with Notepad so if a user does click a .js file, it will harmlessly open in notepad - We have done this. 
 But I have seen further recommendations to do the same for .vbs, .vbe, .jse, .hta and .wsf. I’m wondering if anyone else does this and if this could break anything for end users?

 I&#x27;m looking for some advices how to integrate him back on the team. He was a valuable member of our IT Support Team prior to his illness but I&#x27;m currently have no idea how to approach his return. 
 Anyone experienced something similiar?

But out of these ones, the one that stands out the most for us was the Netwrix one due to the &quot;activities&quot; approach, the capacity of using phantom accounts, etc.
 I want to know if there are ppl here familiar with them.
 First time posting here tho :0)

                              <span>Hi all, potentially not a question for this subreddit but I am a sysadmin! 
 My boss has handed me his old work issued Samsung A10 that is completely locked down using SOTI mobicontrol. The kicker is that the company that this phone belongs to doesn&#x27;t exist anymore and so we are unable to get an admin to unlock the phone. Furthermore, I have contacted SOTI directly and because the company doesn&#x27;t exist anymore they don&#x27;t have permission to unlock it so they can&#x27;t help me.
 I can&#x27;t seem to figure out a way to unlock it - they have me beat at every turn.
 - Developer options is blocked
 - In recovery mode, there is no option to factory reset the phone
 - I am able to get into the settings for about a minute before the mobicontrol kicks in when I restart the phone - otherwise settings is completely disabled
 - The factory reset setting is completely greyed out.
 - In recovery mode, the bootloader is blocked out | when I try to open it, it just says downloading forever with a green screen
 Any methods I can try to get this phone reset or alternatively get soti mobicontrol off the device? Or is the device doomed for eternity?
 Any help would be much appreciated!

                              <span>Without going into detail, I gave a family member of mine a beautiful enterprise laptop that I got for free out of a HW refresh a few years ago. For some reason this relative decided rather than going to me when they had a problem they would run straight to the local &quot;repair shop&quot; as he apparently was chatted up by one of their staff while he was at the chippy.
 This &quot;repair shop&quot; (and I use this dubiously) has made a fucking botch to put it lightly. They claimed he had a virus and that his &quot;hard drive&quot; (actually an SSD) was destroyed by it and he would need a replacement which he happily agreed to. They installed a &quot;new&quot; hard drive and sent it back to him, obviously with slower performance on acc. of having an SSD swapped for a HDD and no effort made to reinstall any of the laptop&#x27;s basic drivers which can be pulled off the manufacturer&#x27;s site with a few minutes on Googles, so this relative had no sound, no WiFi (lucky they use a cable connection, really!) and a prompt to activate Windows.
 When they took it back, they had the sense to call me this time. When I went back with this relative, they had kindly replaced his hard drive with a &quot;solid state drive&quot; and would only charge him £150, what a fucking deal! I actually had a look at the laptop at the shop and it was in the same state as before, no effort to reinstall any drivers, probably was just the same SSD they took out reinstalled and sold back to him at cost, and a prompt to activate Windows. I quite bluntly told them to fuck off, gave them an earful and walked out with my relative and the laptop in tow. Considering either legal or lethal action to get these tw@s to stop bothering him.
 Also, the fucking screws are threaded on the underside so good luck to me getting into that fucker again. At least they had the decency to install another SSD but that&#x27;s nearly £100 of this relative&#x27;s money down the fucking drain.

                              <span>Long story short, and long before my time at this business, someone decided to use free gmail accounts to be used as sign ins for free slack accounts. Ouch.
 We&#x27;ve just made the move from Slack to Teams, and I want to close the gmail accounts completely. These accounts don&#x27;t have phone numbers or alternate emails for verification, and I got through 10 using my mobile number but even after waiting a week I can&#x27;t use it any further ( Unavailable because of too many failed attempts. Try again in a few hours. )
 What&#x27;s the best way to either get in touch with Google or otherwise get these accounts blown off the face of the earth?

                              <span>Just looking for a bit of advice here..
 A friend of mine works at Company A, and they have just been purchased by Company B.
 Both Company&#x27;s have their own MSP, neither have any in-house IT.
 Company B&#x27;s MSP are charging £11k to migrate Company A&#x27;s O365 Tenancy away from Company A.
 There are 25 Users in this tenancy.
 I think this is very excessive in terms of cost, but I am not 100% what is involved so maybe it is correct.
 Does anybody have experience with this and can indicate if this cost is reasonable?

 When you reorder the shared calendars in Outlook then close it down and reopen they go back to the default order?

                              <span>Hello,
 we currently have a strange issue.
 Our customer has 6 AVD session hosts with FSLogix in use.
 The issue: Sometimes a specific program won&#x27;t start anymore on the vm a user is connected to. They have to connect with one of the other session hosts. On that session host it works for 1-2 days and afterwards the same issue occurs.
 The software is not installed on the vms but is started directly from a mapped network drive. It doesn&#x27;t add or edit registry keys and only caches files in one specific folder in AppData. We already excluded that folder from the FSLogix redirection but it didn&#x27;t make a difference.
 The only solution that works is to delete the FSLogix profile and create a new one.
 Additionally, Excel doesn&#x27;t seem to work great either. Users have to restart it every few minutes because of freezing and crashing. Same thing, if the FSLogix profile will be deleted and be newly created it works again for a few days.
 So it seems there is something wrong with FSLogix. We already updated to the newest version and tried both normal caching and cloud cache.
 Weirdly I couldn&#x27;t find anything or anyone on google regarding to this issue.
 Did anyone of you experience similiar issues or has an idea how to fix this? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi. 
 We have Roaming Profiles and Folder Redirection reasonably heavily deployed amongst our on-premises clients. Recently a number of our long term staff who were very experienced with setting these up and troubleshooting issues with these have left, and the replacements we hired have no experience. RP and FR have been pretty stable for us, but we get a couple of issues a month I guess, and we aren&#x27;t really having much luck getting on top of them. 
 I am keen to track down some resources on setting up and troubleshooting Roaming Profiles, including slow logins, errors regarding logging on with locally cached profile, and other common issues like a new profile directory being created locally each time a user logs in.
 I&#x27;d also be interested in tracking down information on how to turn off roaming profiles if we want to stop using them, without losing the profile data and just general troubleshooting in this area. 
 Totally happy to pay for training materials, just really keen to get the new people up to snuff so we don&#x27;t spend hours and hours troubleshooting and or fixing RP Issues.

                              <span>Hello,
 we have had a strange problem with our print server (Win2019 1809) for quite some time.
 If employees try to print a document in the morning, it is sent to the print server, but not printed out immediately. The document is not printed until an admin connects to the server via RDP connection. After the RDP connection, all documents are printed out. This applies to all printers that are connected via a print server.
 1.) The print server can be reached permanently via ping, even in the morning.
 2.) LAN card (Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power) is not checked.
 3.) VMware Tools up to date
 I suspect that during the night some service hangs up. However, I have no idea which one.
 Have you already had a similar phenomenon and can you give me a tip in which event log I can find it?

                              <span>Hi all,
 A few months ago at my job, I managed to transfer 5PB of data across continents with just these tools tools - rsync, gnu parallel, tmux and gdu. Had to use these tools because the environments didn&#x27;t allow to install any other ones. This was my first time doing a transfer of such a scale with such tight constraints on tools and managed to complete it in approx. 3 months. Given this information, how would you rate this work? 1) Based! Would hire you for triple the pay 2) Ok 3) Meh!Unimpressive.

                              <span>HI! 
 Im working at a startup selling saas. 
 We have just got our first client in eu and are looking at more in other countries and struggling to figure out how to respect data sovereignty. 
 We have a very basic IIS server mysql server and this runs everything. We would like to place a server in eu and other countries, and store the data and files for those countries users, on those servers.
 The catch is, there is a few &quot;global&quot; databases that need to be accessed on all servers. 
 Running the application on our current server and using a database in another country does not seem to work well due to latency. I have tested installing IIS on this second location, using a different domain and connecting back to our global databases so only certain requests have additional latency. 
 But this all seems really stupid, surely there is a better way.

                              <span>For anyone that uses teams and uses audio conferencing, does anyone know a way to setup where people that use teams from their phones and other devices to connect have a way to set caller id for # within O365 somehow so when they call from their phone, it shows who they are rather then a phone number. I know I can enable anonymous but when you have 30-40 people calling in, would like to be able to identify who they are. I assume their no way to do this but wondering if anyone have a idea how to identify people by their number.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a young guy and I have a part-time job as an administrator for a medium-sized company. 
 Most of my job is fairly easy work for someone who usually kinda enjoys troubleshooting stuff and 99% of the time all it takes is a bit of googling and the ability to connect the dots (especially when it comes to stuff that someone before me has set up)
 ​
 However, the amount of pure bullshit I have faced over the last few months working this job having to do with Microsoft&#x27;s products is starting to really get on my nerves.
 ​
 Every single week there is some new weird fairly mundane issue with one of Microsofts apps.
 - one week it&#x27;s someone&#x27;s Outlook randomly not being synced between the web version and the client.
 - one week it&#x27;s someone&#x27;s Teams that decides to just completely freeze if the ca…</span>

 Typically would your domain controllers also be DNS servers, or would you seperate out those roles? Also, (assuming an on-prem deployment) where do you place domain controllers &amp; DNS servers? Do campuses &amp; large branches often have their own, or are they coming back to a central data center?

 DEV: Hey dasreboot, that certificate you put on the server doesnt work
 Me: What url are you trying to use?
 DEV: Im on the server and its https://localhost:8080
 Me: neither localhost nor the ip address is listed on that certificate. How did you think that would work?
 It wouldnt be so bad except that they bring it up in meetings. &quot;I&#x27;m blocked cuz dasreboots certificates dont work.&quot;
 Had one tell me last week that the problem was that we were using a self-signed root cert. 
 I swear everyone in the entire group thinks certificates are just magic.

 In the past 24 hours, we sent notification of a node failure impacting your cloud server listed above. 
 Despite extensive efforts, our attempts to manually recover your cloud server were unsuccessful. 
 Our engineering team is currently deploying new instances with the same operating system and IP assignments. You may also deploy a Backup, or Snapshot on a new instance, with a new IP if you prefer. 
 Our staff will be applying a two month account credit for the affected services shortly.

Their extensive effort was about 3.5 hours. No technical explanation. Probably running RAID 0.
 Absolute legends...
 Time to restore I guess...

                              <span>I read a really good article a month or two ago from a security person (I think) who basically said
 &quot;I used to play pranks on people who didn&#x27;t lock their computer. Now I just lock it for them. If I see someone in a coffee shop walk away and leave their computer unattended, rather than being a dick I just keep an eye on it until they come back&quot;
 Obviously heavily paraphrased - but that was the jist of it. 
 I know it is a long shot - but I am trying to find this article again and drawing a complete blank. Every time I try to google it I get hundreds of pages of search results for the best pranks to pull on people who leave their computers unlocked.
 And yes - switching their mouse from right to left handed or rotating their screen 90 degrees is amusing, but not what I am looking for right now...
 Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.

 Looking for any insights from folks that have or had used it. Good, bad, and ugly. Also if there are alternatives that do the same or close to the same. It’s pricy - I think doable but pricy. Thanks in advance.

 They had this reported issue the weekend before last. At the EXACT SAME TIME, one of my larger clients that is on Zscaler started having a similar issue as well, which Zscaler claims to have &quot;resolved&quot;. But the ROOT of the issue has nothing to do with Microsoft. Zscaler is sending traffic out the wrong data center. 
 All of our traffic at the same time this incident was posted, started routing out through their Mexico data center. Despite me pointing out numerous times that these two issues seem related, support wouldn&#x27;t accept this because that posted issue talks about 365 (even though it&#x27;s only 365 simply not allowing logins due to some Zscaler traffic/routing/geo issue.

                              <span>In the last week I&#x27;ve gotten a bunch of reports from different users about getting &quot;We&#x27;ve updated your phone number&quot; notification emails from Capital One. Most of these users don&#x27;t have accounts with the bank so were reporting phishing emails.
 I thought it was a standard phishing mass attack posing as a bank then hitting lots of people to try to get people with an account there, but after looking into it they&#x27;re actually coming from Capital One. At least they&#x27;re coming from the same IPs and domains as confirmed legit Capital One emails. 
 So far we&#x27;ve gotten at least a hundred of these emails. They have all the looks of a phishing campaign. They&#x27;re hitting old and disabled accounts as well as current legit ones. 
 There&#x27;s nothing malicious I&#x27;ve found in the emails. The embedded links all go to the correct sites. So I&#x27;m not sure what the point of the emails are. 
 I&#x27;ve reached out to their abuse email address, but doubt I&#x27;ll hear much back. 
 Has anyone else seen anything going on like this?

                              <span>MSP I work for uses Addigy for all Mac devices, and wants to add ABM into the mix. Problem is, we have a couple hundred Macs we manage already, and I&#x27;m not seeing a way to add them into ABM without first wiping the machine and using a fucking iPhone to magic wand them into ABM. I know Apple is stuffed to the gills with fuckery, but there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s that fucking stupid, right? Right???

                              <span>Quite often, I have to deal with this situation. Is it just me?
 Ticket : COMputrer borken
 Description: none
 Me: (After spending 5 minutes gazing into the abyss, forces self to call user)
 &quot;Hi, can you walk me through what exactly you are experiencing?&quot;
 User: &quot;Well, I got up this morning and had coffee. My coffee was cold so I warmed it up. One minute ought to do it, but sometimes it&#x27;s too hot, so I put an ice cube in it. I don&#x27;t like putting ice in my coffee, because it&#x27;s supposed to be hot. If I wanted iced coffee I would have got iced coffee, its different, ya know? I might be the only one in my family who likes coffee except my Uncle Jim who is the only other one who likes it. Now that&#x27;s funny because he hates cats but I love cats. My cats names are...
 1 hour and 0 pauses for reply later
 ... and then I flushed the toilet and sat back down at my desk. I turned my computer on and my icons on my desktop &quot;look different&quot;. Can you make them &quot;look normal&quot; again? I liked that layout better!
 What on earth does their workday look like? Good Gravy! Where do they find time? Why do I have to engage in extended social foreplay just to get an answer to a simple question?

                              <span>I did it. I screwed up.
 I have 2x 2019 domain controllers. Deployed and promoted 2x 2022 DC&#x27;s. Waited a few days for replication to happen. Moved FSMO roles to the new DC&#x27;s, demoted the first 2019 DC. Shutdown the 2nd 2019 server... then all hell broke loose. Apparently, the 2 new DC&#x27;s are still waiting for initial replication to complete. The old 2019 server is saying it&#x27;s been 392 days since it connected with a partner and won&#x27;t replicate with any others until it does so.
 I screwed up by not checking my DC logs before shutting removing the first DC. Let that be a lesson to everyone doing an upgrade. Always check your logs.
 Now I am stuck with 2 DC&#x27;s who are waiting for initial replication to complete with another DC who thinks it is too out of date to talk to anyone. What are my options? How can I tell the old DC that it can replicate with other devices? Can I force the new DC&#x27;s to believe what they have been transferred is a complete sync?
 EDIT:
 I was able to resolve my issue by going on to the 2019 DC and changing the MaxOfflineTimeInDays to beyond the number of days that the DC thought it had been disconnected by issuing the following command and then restarting the DFSR service:
 wmic.exe /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path DfsrMachineConfig set MaxOfflineTimeInDays&#x3D;450
 After that, I forced replication on both the new 2022 DC&#x27;s who were able to complete initial synchronization. Thanks to everyone for their help!

                              <span>Hello, 
 We are writing to inform you that a vulnerability has been discovered within a Veeam® Backup &amp; Replication™ component that could allow an unauthenticated user request encrypted credentials that could lead to them gaining access to backup infrastructure hosts. This affects all Veeam Backup &amp; Replication versions. 
 We have developed patches for V11 and V12 to mitigate this vulnerability and we recommend you update your installations immediately. If you are not the current manager of your Veeam environment, please forward this email to the proper person. If you use an all-in-one Veeam appliance with no remote backup infrastructure components, you can also block external connections to port TCP 9401 in the backup server firewall as a temporary remediation until the patch is installed. 
 Veeam has a long-standing commitment to ensuring our products protect customers from any potential risk. As part of this, we run a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) for all our products. In mid-February, a security researcher identified and reported this vulnerability for Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v11 and v12 with a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating high severity. We immediately reviewed and confirmed the vulnerability and developed an update that resolves the issue.
 If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact Veeam support: https://my.veeam.com/#/open-case/step-1
 Thank you,
 Veeam Customer Support

                              <span>Over the years I&#x27;ve amassed a pretty long list of things I&#x27;ve learned how to do only to find that I actually kind of hate doing them, or had a past experience so bad it&#x27;s soured my opinion beyond the point of ever considering a return. 
 I&#x27;ll start with my top 3 never mentions:
 Networking past a layer 2/3 switch. I&#x27;m plenty capable of doing all kind of fancy things with networks, but truthfully I just hate it. I can&#x27;t stand doing network planning and carving out subnets, managing VIPs, QoS, all the VLANs, etc. etc. It&#x27;s just boring and tedious to me. I learned my lesson early when I temporarily took over for a netadmin position at a previous job while we looked for a new one. Never again. Now I pretend like the only thing I know about networking is related to hosts and proxies.

We are currently pushing for NIST 800-171 and CMMC Level 2 but, my organization&#x27;s current stance is causing some serious issues within the company. Currently we seem to be getting multiple tickets almost daily about users monitors, keyboards, and mice not working when they go to sign in for the day. If I turn off certain DMA protections everything works like it should. I have proposed to my management that we should consider disabling these for the sake of making this easier for our users. Can any of you chime in on how you are dealing with these issues?

                              <span>I work in an industry/company chocked full of users past retirement age, but typically they’re very with it or switch to consulting before losing their sharpness. 
 However my whole team (servicedesk) has noticed a very senior manager starting to really behave strangely. We’re very astute when it comes to noticing brain fog, tiredness, distraction; it’s none of those things. 
 Is there anything I should do other than provide more attentive support? Let HR know, or an even more senior leader?

I can play around with my own system, but want to avoid accidental/ignorant configurations that lets malicious actors in. Also, breaking the network stack will be pretty upsetting to family. I&#x27;ve searched for a while for training with an online environment. All the results are video courses, books, or company courses.

I’m trying to add a user to a folder through the security tab to give them access to the folder but I get a message saying “Remotely setting permissions on the folder at the root of a share removes all inherited permissions from the root folder and all subfolders. To set permissions without removing the inherited permissions dick No and either change the permissions on a child folder or make the change while logged in locally. Do you want to continue”
 I tried looking online for solutions as well as on here but I couldn’t find any and was wondering if someone could help me on here.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have two domains which are no longer existence, and haven&#x27;t been for a long while.
 I want to cleanup the metadata of that domain in our primary domain. Trusts etc. are still visible (transitive trust) and in sites and services they are still visible.
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it, ntdsutil is no option because there isn&#x27;t a DC anymore for that domains.
 I am not certain what my options are now? Does any one of you ever encountered this?
 Thanks in advance,
 Kind regards,
 Roy

                              <span>Not sure if this is going to apply to anyone but if you are using a on-premise Radius/MFA Server in a Microsoft environment I highly recommend transitioning to SAML. 
 In particular my company just upgraded from some old ASAs to a MX-105 in HA, it was a bitch to set up the static routes between a old Cisco switch and a MX. One of the perks is being able to configure SAML in Azure AD. It just seems like alot more wholesome and customizable way to allow and configure Anyconnect VPN access with MFA. 
 Feel free to comment or DM me if you have any questions or want help!

                              <span>This might be a long shot... But I&#x27;m hoping that somewhere out there, someone has faced the same issue and maybe even found a fix.
 We have a bunch of Windows 10 Pro clients, and some Windows 11 Pro clients, which were initially on-prem domain joined, but have since become hybrid joined with AAD.
 My issue is that our users (about 500) have license for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, but only about half of the clients are running Business, the rest is stuck on Pro.
 Now, for some reason, it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to find any documentation on how this edition change actually works or should happen. Everything on MS, both on Learn and TechNet concerns Enterprise only, and even our CSP&#x27;s licensing experts couldn&#x27;t give a straight answer. (The first guy I spoke to, even claimed that there was no such thing as &quot;Windows 10 Business&quot;... o.O )
 Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a KMS key specifically for &quot;Business&quot;, because if there was, I could just have the clients run a slmgr script silently, and that&#x27;d be the end of it -- and &quot;just buy E3&quot; (as another &quot;expert&quot; from our CSP suggested) is not en option either.
 Any insights, pointers or even encouraging comments are highly welcome and greatly appreciated.

Anyone run into this. Seems to happen only in one ou (so far) I&#x27;m the support guy who has to tell the users that the stuff they had saved on their desktop is now gone.

                              <span>Howdy.
 I am a fairly new sysadmin, bit over 1 year of experience. Having to start to deal with DNS a bit more now, and while i understand the very basics, most of it is still quite confusing to me and im struggling to follow guides because i don&#x27;t have a great understanding of the fundamentals. Are there any guides, series, certs, websites that go in depth about DNS?

                              <span>Hello, 
 As a student, I have been assigned to create an app that solves a specific problem. I have come up with an idea for a Hyper-V manager app that I think would be useful. However, I want to make sure that my app is more comprehensive than just monitoring Hyper-V. Therefore, I would like to hear your thoughts on what features are lacking in existing tools, like Windows Admin Center or any other tools you use, that you believe should be included in a Hyper-V manager app. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin!
 I am reaching out to ask what would be a nice thing to do for some admins that helped me out. Quick background, I started a new job a few months ago and was put in charge of building up a small mobile network with VMs, VoIPs, printers, WiFi, etc. I had a few people that came in and helped me put it all together. We had our first event recently and were complimented on how well everything ran. There were some issues to iron out but for the most part, it went really well. What would be the best way to thank them for their efforts? Keep in mind, they are not part of my organization, I am not a manager in anyway, I have no power to increase their salaries or get them a bonus. Thinking either taking them out to dinner or getting them each a small gift or something else. Any ideas on what would be good?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me. I work in the education sector as a Network Admin and I&#x27;m looking to clear down user profiles en-masse using PDQ Deploy and Powershell but I&#x27;m running into a few problems.
 We have over 1000 students here all with roaming profiles and 400~ PCs, we are looking at getting rid of roaming at some stage but that&#x27;s by the by.
 So, I tried the following scripts in Powershell:
 Get-ChildItem -path &quot;C:\Users\*&quot; -Exclude Default, Administrator | Remove-Item -Recurse -verbose 
 And simply:
 Remove-Item &#x27;C:\Users\*&#x27; -Exclude Default, Administrator -Force -Recurse 
 The problem is, I&#x27;m getting an Unauthorized Access error. This happens despite running the script with elevated privileges, even locally.
 It has deleted the empty files and subfolders in each account, but leaving files like NTUSER.Dat and &#x27;My Documents&#x27;.
 Would I need to run a script to take ownership/give modify access to all these folders beforehand? Or is there a better method for doing this?
 Thanks in advance.

 some of my users are getting the error &quot;there are not enough system resources to complete this operation&quot; when they are trying to access the address book, no matter which address list they are trying to access.
 i tried all the basic, opening in safe mode, creating new profile, online fix of the installation,reinstalling, moving to a different office edition(2016 to 2019).
 further more tried to activate legacy caching mode, and disabling caching of shared folders.
 when i reinstalled on one workstation it worked fine for a day or two and stated giving the error again

                              <span>Is it possible to make user accounts data shared across multiple PCs? 
 What I mean is, when a user logs into any pc in the domain, the data from the account is loaded onto the PC, so the user has always the same desktop and data.

                              <span>Hello fellow Sysadmins.
 A C220 M4 with the latest recommended firmware I am working on displays the following fault messages on latest version diagnostics at Server Health:
 PSU1 PSU1_PWRGD: Power Supply sensor for PSU1, State Asserted
 PSU2 PSU2_PWRGD: Power Supply sensor for PSU2, State Asserted
 The server has two 770W PSU.
 All other subsystems report healthy condition, including CIMC. I have read on Cisco site that there is a similar bug in v3 firmware and it was fixed. I am using v4.1g firmware.
 Research
 How to resolve this situation ?

                              <span>Hey guys, we are currently planning to renew our WIFI infrastructure and want to implent a stable mobile voice solution as well. We wanted to use VoWIFI so we can keep the smartphones that are in use allready.
 We are a manufacturing and metalworking industry with about 400 employees thus having alot of machinery as well as office workplaces.
 We just had a site survey done and the results show that we need to roughly double the amount of APs that are currently in use if we wanted to use VoWIFI.
 That brought up some questions:
 1. What is your experience with VoWIFI?
 2. What is your experience with VOIP Apps on smartphones in daily use?
 2. In what cases would you use VoWIFI and in wich DECT?

                              <span>My company has a shared o365 mailbox for customer support and I wonder if I can fetch statistics for that mailbox. The information I&#x27;m looking for is, 
  
How long does the mail stay unanswered? 
 Individual statistics of who responds, and how many % of the emails they respond too.
  
As the mailbox probably is fairly old, it would be helpful if it was possible to only measure the last X months, otherwise time of employment would impact the stats. 
 I&#x27;m waiting to get a MS o365 admin account, but the people that create them are a tad bit slow. I hope I posted this question in the right sub. I&#x27;m a bit new to all this, having done a drastic career change into IT admin in my mid 30s due to an injury.

                              <span>A client has asked us to replace their old server, with a newer one. 
 Single Domain, 25 users. Folder Redirection and Roaming Profiles. 
 The server was originally at the start, a 2003 SBS server and over the years has been migrated to new hardware with whatever version of Windows was current at the time. The intention is to put Server 2022 on the new Hardware. It&#x27;s currently on 2012R2
 Given how many upgrades it&#x27;s had, we are wondering about whether it would be better to create a new domain from scratch vs trying to do yet another upgrade. There seems to be legacy GPO&#x27;s going back many many many years and we are a little worried that there is stuff in the system now that could be problematic. 
 Before anyone asks, yes they require an on-prem server for another cycle as their LOB application doesn&#x27;t have a cloud equivalent for another 2 years at least. 
 One of the main issues is moving the profiles up and setting them up on the new domain etc.
 ​
 Interested in your thoughts on that.

 I am trying to run a scheduled task to open a URL on a daily basis. I tried using a powershell script with the Invoke-WebRequest command but I keep getting an Invoke-WebRequest : ERROR 
 So I instead set up a scheduled task to run a program (Chrome) and in the argument I added the link to open. That worked fine BUT the scheduled task remains as &quot;Running&quot;. I checked the box to end after one minute but it remains running. Is there a way to stop it?

                              <span>Looking for guidance on an environment with Azure Password Hash Sync Enabled with having Azure AD device joined systems only (No Hybrid). We are slowly migrating client systems to Azure AD joined devices. There are a small handful of on-premise application/file servers remaining in the environment.
 With password hash sync, Users with expired passwords are allowed to access cloud resources normally. However, the rub begins where said user with Azure AD Joined system attempts to access an on-premise resource, which prompts for credentials (Because the password is expired). Simply wondering what the general guidance is to keep passwords synced back to on-premise AD for users logging into Azure AD Join systems. The on-premise AD Password policy matches the Azure Password policy.
 I was thinking about setting &quot;EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers&quot; from this article https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronizatio. Per this setting, the password would need to be changed on-prem first to initiate the enforcement process.

                              <span>Currently have 2 VMW clusters, each using a single Nexus 9300 for all traffic
 For resiliency, we are adding a 2nd Nexus 9300 standalone switch to each vmw cluster(all 10g), and uplink to the distribution switch on separate 1g MMF (Eventually the dist switch will be upgraded to 10g) In case I am explaining poorly, I drew a map, below
 Should I uplink each 9300 to it&#x27;s partner? (as shown in green on the image at https://pasteboard.co/7rlWvcdFysaz.png )
 Or will this cause spanning tree problems? note I do not want to do Virtual Port Channels , as I want each switch to be completely separate

                              <span>Consider the following hub and spoke topology where each vnet spoke utilizes a different front-end IP on the respective load balancer within the hub network for forced tunneling for ingress traffic to be inspected by the pair of NVAs in the hub network.
 https://imgur.com/dYSzKUo
 We can assume that each NIC is assigned a route table with a UDR that points 0.0.0.0/0 to the respective IP (load balancer IPs) shown in the diagram. We can assume that the NVA&#x27;s are running active/active and are configured as backend pool members for each load balancer in the diagram.
 ​
 If both of the load balancer back end pools are configured in the following order:
 Load balancer in 10.0.0.0/24
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.0.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.0.11
 
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
 What would be the effect, if any, upon traffic if the order of one of the back-end pool members were reversed so that it is displayed as follows:
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
 ​
 To provide context, I am trying to understand in what instances does the order of the backend pool on azure load balancers impact and effect traffic flow, and what considerations need to be understood here for this to make sense.
 I would appreciate the communities thoughts on this to help my understanding on this subject.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m lets say a little rusty on routing, was just looking for conformation. sorry if my terminology is not spot on.
 I have an layer 3 switch (Aruba 8320) at the core of my network, it is doing all the routing and is configured with the final route as 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.0.18 (my firewall), however I want to re-route the traffic from VLAN 66 (10.66.0.0/21) to another device (different interface on firewall, as I can enable a captive portal for that vlan only). if these two devices are directly connected I assume the I do the following to re-route the traffic.
 Configure firewall interface: 192.16.30.5/29
 Configure layer 3 switch interface: 192.168.30.6/29
 Configure route in layer 3 switch: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.5
 the bit I&#x27;m unsure of is do I need to configure a vlan for 19.168.30.0/29
 interface vlan 30
 description Guest_Wireless_VLAN
 ip address 192.168.30.2/29
 active-gateway ip mac e2:ff:5e:ac:09:07
 active-gateway ip 192.168.30.1
 and change the route to: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.1 or keep it the same
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, I would like to know your opinion regarding how change and risk management is done in your organizations. I am particularly interested in risk management (not security risk but potential impacts due to change).
 The ITIL framework is useful however there is an element that I struggle with, potential customers impacts, normally when defining potential, we might think as the worst case scenario, but even small simple changes could have big potential impact if we consider a typo when adding a new policy in an existing vrf, someone might say deleting or modifying policies are riskier, and I would normally agree, but when it comes to typos, missing a statement, wrong IP, community tag, etc, could have severe consequences.
 In my organization we have defined these categories to come with a number, the number will fall under ITIL thresholds, P1-P4, these are the categories:
 Potential Customer Impact, it is based on the activity being performed and the amount of customers potentially impacted.
 Type Element, it is a grouping that depends on type of element, for example, a core IP layer element would have higher value than a Voice or Data(Application layer) element.
 Service Area, based on the geographical area that the element is providing services, example, it could be region of a country, a state, it could be within a city.
 Service Density, amount of actual services that the element is supporting.
 As you can see, Type, Service Area and Service Density are based on the element where the work is going to be performed, but the Potential Customer Impact is based on the activity itself only.
 My struggle is finding a good balance in the risk management for the activity itself as there are many details like typos or missing small pieces of configuration that could create a big impact even though the activity itself could be a simple one. 
 How does your organization manage risk from changes? What ideas can you share with me based on the above?
 Thanks in advance.

 Unfortunately rfc3768 comes with plenty of hoops and bugs on vyos currently and I was wondering what is the likely outcome if I disable rfc3768 support? keepalived will send GARP packages on failover and then resend it after a delay. Do you have experience with equipment missing/ignoring garp packets and not failing over?

 9405 Chassis based switch
 9364c Fixed port 
 Both above switch. provides 100Gbps ports and assuming they provide same performance but Which model is good for management/operation point of view? 
 We have 20 Racks and i believe 9364c should be enough to last long but just wanted to compare with 9504 chassis and see if anyone has any opinion on above two kind of hardware?

                              <span>Hi, I was wondering if you all could have a look at what I&#x27;ve researched as of today regarding a summary of coding modulations and let me know of any feedback you might have? 
 I have a section where there is a question mark in brackets regarding wider channels, etc.. and I&#x27;m unsure of this bit and what a wider channel technically gives you. Yes, I know it means more data being sent, thus faster speeds, etc.. but when it comes down to it, QAM 1024 is sending 1024 different phases combinations in each transmission either on 20Mhz or 80Mhz, so what is 80Mhz doing behind the scenes with QAM that 20Mhz can&#x27;t do? Is it sending more QAM 1024 transmissions?
 Thanks...
 Coding modulations are a way of sending more binary digits through each phase combined with transmitting more phase combinations …</span>

                              <span>Hi all I have a Fortigate 100F (running HA) and Juniper Mx4300 layer 3 switches. I am planning on creating multiple VLANS to separate network traffic/resources. I know I can create the VLANS and use IRB/SVI (logical ports) for the VLAN routing and connect the switches with trunk links and setup some DHCP forwarding (ip-helper) addresses on the IRB interfaces to leverage the DHCP ranges on the Fortigate 100F, But I wasn&#x27;t sure about the connection from the switch to the Fortigate. Is that considered a trunk link too? I would think it would just be a standard link and then you have the routing to the VLANs setup on the router with static/dynamic routes or whatever. Or is there an easier way to do this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 Does anyone have any suggestions of innovative ideas, either simple or complex that helped really add value to their team?

 Boss -
 I have an e-mail out to VAR to confirm lead times of both platform APs, but barring some notable surprise on delivery dates – I’m landing on Juniper Mist for (Corporate Office). As discussed briefly today, I narrow the conversation down to (3) primary areas of focus.
 Performance + Capability There were some noteworthy differentiators re: how similar functions are approached between the platforms. Mist APs were designed w/ an additional radio dedicated to nothing but collecting analytics for proactive correlation and RF optimization. Aruba has attempted to copy the same behavior…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 Recently I&#x27;ve configured HSRP on our core switches. Because of the physical limitations of our fiber connections, we only have one trunk interface as the heartbeat interface between the two core switches. I set Core Sw1 as primary for all VLANs and Core Sw2 as the secondary for all VLANs. The configurations were successful and when I pull the ethernet cable going to our ASA, the traffic still flows through Core Sw2. However, when I unplug Core Sw1, we lose connection on the entire network. 
 Quickly explaining our Core to ASA connection: the connection from Core Sw1 and Core Sw2 is a single cable connection from each of the Core Switch. We only have one ASA running on the network at the moment.
 What could be causing this problem? I brought up setting up STP root manually so that the VLANs have a cost to follow to the Distribution then to Core Switches, but my Supervisor is insisting that doesn&#x27;t matter. If I can get a clear technical explanation as to why our failover isn&#x27;t happening when Core Sw1 loses power it will be very helpful.

 My original plan was to use spare Meraki MS120&#x27;s as the breakouts, but the MSP said it was a bad idea due to licensing, despite me showing them a known working config for exactly this use case. Instead they recommended 2 dumb L2 switches.
 I&#x27;m not a network person specifically, but I can handle the basics of Meraki. I&#x27;m just not sure what config is needed for these 1000&#x27;s.
 If I follow what my plan was for the MS120&#x27;s, this is what the config would look like for the 1000&#x27;s
 How wrong is this? And if this is somehow the right idea, I&#x27;m assuming there is more to do on the config...any advice?

                              <span>Hi All. We are an IT consulting form and commonly perform site surveys for clients. Most of our clients have small to medium sized sites with between 5-20 APs. Lots of small warehouse clients that we do this for.
 Currently we use free predictive wireless heatmapping tools, and the free Wi-Fi analyzer tool to provide heatmaps and recommendations to clients. We basically use the existing AP placements and predictive heatmap tool to make an approximated heat map, then go onsite and use Wi-Fi analyzer to confirm the accuracy of the predictive heatmap and look for interference and optimal channels to set. It&#x27;s pretty manual but fairly easy/not complex for us to do.
 Also we help them by recommending Wi-Fi settings such as the channels, etc. This has seemingly been enough for our clients and they&#x27;ve been happy with the results. We&#x27;re able to make plenty of recomendations using our method.
 We&#x27;ve actually had clients tell us that another competitor came in and did a survey with other (paid) tools and the reports were overly confusing to them and took too long.
 We&#x27;re starting to raise our prices for site surveys more towards what our competitors are charging, so I&#x27;m looking into paid site survey tools to see if they can provide anymore value to clients or efficiency on our end. 
 What would ya&#x27;ll recommend? We do around 1-2 surveys a month, mostly for small clients like I described above. I would prefer something cloud based, something we can easily install/license on our laptops (for our team of 5 engineers), no physical tool, and affordable (don&#x27;t think we need something like Ekahau for these smaller surveys?). Right now I&#x27;m looking at NetSpot. 
 Please let me know what you would recommend and why.

                              <span>Anyone here familiar with Nokia and their certifications. I am interested in obtaining few of their certifications just because they have good opportunities internationally. One of their fundamental certifications that I would like to obtain is the 4A0-100 which focuses on Nokias product line service routing. Nokia does offer online courses but they are very expensive and it is very difficult finding self-study resources. I would love to know if you have any experience with Nokia or have any suggestions regarding their certifications.

 My issue I am having is that my ips are not routing globally. Just internally. Is their anyone who could assist me in the proper commands/config?
 I don&#x27;t mind paying someone to assist me.

                              <span>Symptoms:
 -OSPF adjecency fully established-No routes received over OSPF adjacency on either end-Traffic goes the long way around
 Cause:
 -I have accidentally skipped adding the OSPF point to point subinterface to &#x27;mpls ldp&#x27;.
 Question: Why did OSPF not send routes over a P2P subinterface, even when an adjacency was fully established, just because I skipped putting the subinterface into MPLS(accidentaly)? It seems that this is happening even before route-path-cost calculations.
 FYI it is fixed now. And it was the same on OSPFv3.

                              <span>As a result of a merger, we&#x27;re moving two schools into the same new building and we&#x27;re planning the new network accordingly. Within the first couple years, the two schools will operate independently, however staff from both schools will be sharing staffrooms, printers, libraries and halls. We want to ensure that, whatever the solution, network resources belonging to the two schools are safely kept isolated.
 At the moment, one school is running users and computers in a Windows Workgroup in a very simple scenario, while the second school has a more advanced setup, which is depicted here: https://i.ibb.co/8XVYw3F/unnamed-1.jpg
  
Core LAN (not into a VLAN) for on premise trusted Windows devices and AD servers
 Staff VLAN, for BYOD devices and mobile phones
 Guest VLAN for students :school chromebooks and BYOD
 Printers VLAN, shared with the above LANs and VLANs, inbound only traffic
 PBX VLAN, runs traffic from DECT and softphones
  
Assuming that, as for the merger, users and computers from the first school will be moved into an AD Domain, we could think of two possible choices:
  
Logically segregate users and computers using two domains, and two &quot;zones&quot;, which implies duplicating the above network design. Manage two domains, two isolated groups of WIFI networks, plus a shared network, which would be more tedious to manage, but maybe more secure, or
 Integrate users and computers into a unique domain, manage a shared network infrastructure, ensuring that a granular and hardened access control to resources is in place. More flexible, but more prone to &quot;attacks&quot; if not properly designed
  
Of course, brand new network appliances will be thrown in: switches, APs, routers and firewalls.
 With all the above in mind, what solution would you choose? What are your suggestions?

                              <span>I am looking into layer 2 wholesale solutions and would really appreciate some clarification on how IP addressing works.
 Local circuits provided by a wholesaler presented to colo as PPP over L2TP.
 How does IP addressing for customers work? The specific wholesale provider I&#x27;m looking into require a subnet for BGP links and for connecting their LAC to my LNS.
 Do I just use IP addresses within the same subnet I use for the BGP peering or do I use private IPv4 addresses and then CGNAT? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone. My new gig has me maintaining and standing up new IPSec VPN’s on almost weekly basis. It’s kind of my main role here to be honest. Before coming here I had 0 experience with IPSec but I’m learning as I go.
 I have a design question here… seeking wisdom to prevent me from possibly painting myself into a corner. Regarding the phase 1 ikev2 policies, specifically on the Cisco ASA… how should the order look and is there a better way to number all of them?
 Like should a more secure policy be a lower index number than a less secure policy? If you order and index them poorly – could anything be impacted?
 I guess there have been 3 network engineers here in the last 2 years and I see very random numbering... even a random ass Policy 71... it just screams bad design to me but I&#x27;m not familiar with the topic well enough to pin point it.
 Any tips/wisdom is appreciated.

                              <span>I proposed Netbox but it got shutdown very easily by the cybersecurity because it is Opensource. Therefore, it is very bad and not suitable for the environment. There proposal is Solarwinds products.
 I am not too familiar with Solarwinds IPAM. I have used it in the past, but it was so slow that I ended using an excel sheet. I really need to start documenting my network for my team and I.
 This is something I am looking for:
  
IPAM can do multi-tenancy something like a tenant can login and can only view and edit their own IP block
 Can record circuits, etc
 Can record VMs, Containers, bare-metal servers
 Has a capability of documenting racks in the datacenter
 VLANs, VxLAN and VRF information
 Can detect overlapping IP or subnets
  
I have never used infoblox and can&#x27;t really say much about it. At to this point, I need to provide my top 3 products that can be purchased so that it is suitable for enterprise environment. 
 Can you share the paid product you use and can it do a simple DCIM ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling to understand whether a switch is used when terminating L2TP sessions (originating from wholesale l2tp subscriber access). 
 My understanding is that the LNS is usually a router. 
 My confusion is that it&#x27;s common for the PPP L2TP traffic to be VLAN tagged. So you would need a switch to deal with this, right?
 Would really appreciate any help, thanks!

 As per title, could you please advise what could be a good solid replacement for that switch ?
 I would like to add 10+ Gbe connection to support next infrastructure upgrade but I don&#x27;t really know what are the good machines these days. 
 If possible something that not costs an arm and a leg ;)
 Thank you

                              <span>I need your consultation.
 Let me briefly explain the topic I am working on:
 I work on the topic &quot;satellite integrated terrestrial system&quot; and am trying to understand what dynamic functional split and placement of RAN functions.
 I am a newbie and have never been working on these topics. Reading publications and attempting parallel to understand the basic concepts of the functional split, network slicing, and RAN are inefficient for me. I can spend 3-4 hours or more on one 4 pages-paper.
 Could you please help me with understanding the following questions:
  
What is a dynamic functional split? Does it mean that the placement of central(CU), distributed (DU) and radio units (RU) can be changed during transmission?
  
&quot;dynamic&quot; - process or system characterized by constant change, activity, or progress.
  
I have found a lot of publications where Open-Ran is proposed as a promising technology for satellite-integrated terrestrial networks. For a next-generation wireless system, we expect a huge amount of data and such an integrated system can help with overload. Why does Cloud Ran (CRAN) not suitable then?
  
CRAN can support up to hundreds of gigabit data rates cost-effectively without degrading the performance.

                              <span>HI Folks. I just wanted to confirm what will be the destination against which the packet loss and jitter are measured on the VCE monitor page.
 From my understanding, it should be the primary gateway. I just need some confirmation.

                              <span>Hi there, trying to keep this question as straight forward as possible. I have a client who will be leasing the left half of their large building and working in their right half. They’ll be keeping the ISP hand off in the same data room and will have a large fiber run from the left half to the right. Nothing on the left half of the building will be connected to their network. 
 What’s best practice? Putting the firewall on the ISP side or on the client side of the fiber run? 
 Note: They use unmanaged converters now but I suggested using switching with SPF so we can manage it better and see connection quality, etc. 
 Thanks in advance! This sub is always super helpful.

You don’t have a “work family”, you just have your family. That’s it. I wanted to bring this up as some major changes happened with one of the companies I do contract/client work with. 
 I will not go into specific detail for opsec reasons of course, but this company is based abroad with many different people I know working in the IT department from many different parts of the world. Long story short, the company did a “special holiday week” right before the office was closed for the Christmas/New Years week in a half. The CEO bought lunches for the entire week (those that work in the office), let people off early the entire…</span>

                              <span>Hey all you smart people, kia ora from New Zealand! So we use an on premise version of ServiceDesk Plus (help desk tool) , and it integrates with Endpoint Central (endpoint management tool) they are both via Manage Engine, but looking around for alternatives. Our requirements are it needs to be ITIL centric and handle desktop management, remoting capability as well as handling change control, as well as the usual request /incident logging.
 For a user base of approx 1200 users.
 Anyone moved away from those products to others and have some experiences to share? (if you knew back then what you know now, post migration, would you have chosen another option etc?)
 Cloud is highly preferable for all the reasons.
 Thanks heaps in advance, I didn&#x27;t realise how many options are out there now, and they all promise the world... But I&#x27;d like some real feedback from the coal face. (and not gonna lie, would love to learn from your mistakes/regrets, haha)

                              <span>I took a new job mid last year. I like a lot about it, pays well. One if the things is we need to clean up a server environment. We&#x27;re AWS but they have a local environment in HQ.
 It&#x27;s an absolute mess. They hired me to run point and get it cleaned up along with being a Cloud Engineer.
 There are servers piled high with really resource intensive software. Some on the domain, some not. Nothing central. Easy to resolve. Basic stuff. But noone will hear me or they want to address 1000 things at once.
 There are these two dev servers just piled high. SQL, IIS, Visual Studio, and a huge swath of dev software. And they have developersiterally remoting in and working directly on the servers. Running massive processes in VS.
 I have told the CTO until Im blue in the face... Throwing more resources at these wint solve the issue. Well just keep adding resources. We need to split up some of it. SQL at the least.
 And he just isn&#x27;t hearing my actual point. Saying things like, it&#x27;s a lower env we can have sql and iis on one server. That&#x27;s not my point....
 I got a request this morning and there are two ways to do it. One takes 15 steps, the other way takes 2. The easy way is modifying the config. I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure which setting it was so... I sent an email asking, &quot;Which setting in the configuration is x?&quot; 
 This guy responds, &quot;Yes, you can do it in the config.&quot; It&#x27;s like no matter how I word it - he doesn&#x27;t take my goddammit point and I&#x27;m about to put my foot through a window.
 Like I make this very well and clear point and he says, &quot;Thanks for your inputs but its okay to have x y and z on a single server in a lower env.
 That was never my point. My point was - these vms are going to eat up every fucking thing you give them and well end up in a never ending loop of adding resources and you&#x27;ll never remember that I said it would happen. Instead you&#x27;ll just ask me, why does this keep happening? Like it&#x27;s my fault.....

                              <span>So I never really thought I&#x27;d be making a post like this but that&#x27;s only because I was too busy being an atta boy and not paying attention to the writing on the wall. 
 I&#x27;m a system admin over a very specific set of applications and systems. I&#x27;ve expressed my want to move outside of this role, however those conversations have been fruitless for the most part. I got an opportunity at another company for System Admin in a more traditional IT role. I spoke with my bosses today after telling them about the opportunity and I got the &quot;what can we do to keep you&quot; speech. 
 I feel like my biggest hurdle is my current boss. He knows half as much as I do, does 1/4 of the tickets I do, and delegates every.single.chance he gets. He&#x27;s not a managing Sr, he&#x27;s supposed to be a working Sr admin, which has been made abundantly clear to him via our chain several times, yet still there&#x27;s next to no production from his office. I can&#x27;t get a raise because then I&#x27;ll make more than he does, and I can&#x27;t get promoted because he doesn&#x27;t have any place that&#x27;ll take him, he has a bad work history within our department and is frankly lucky to even have a job at this point. 
 My question is...do I keep sticking around and trudging forward in the hopes that eventually the ice will break and I&#x27;ll get a chance to move? Or do I just pick up my toys and go play someplace else where I can gain traditional IT experience that will go towards my resume if I choose to move again later on? I&#x27;ve been at my current company for 16 years, which makes it harder to just pack up and go.

                              <span>Today marks the day that I can close a chapter.
 ​
 Six months ago, I started a new job, leaving a low-paying on-site technician position at a MSP for in house End User Support at a medium sized company. They offered me the job based on my troubleshooting and Windows admin skill. I was able to quickly get up to speed on the day to day tasks, and after about a month I started tackling a bigger project: the Windows deployment image that was set up by a technician who had left some time ago. It had been put in place in 2015 and has been trucking along ever since. Slowly gaining more and more issues as it aged, but not enough for it to be an emergency. It still worked at least.
 ​
 I began slowly poking at it. First learning how to replicate the image we already had in place (but with better B…</span>

                              <span>For those that don&#x27;t remember or haven&#x27;t seen. There&#x27;s a series of updates that have been released and are being released to address some encryption issues in Active Directory. 
 https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5020805-how-to-manage-kerberos-protocol-changes-related-to-cve-2022-37967-997e9acc-67c5-48e1-8d0d-190269bf4efb

 We were like many others in that the first update kinda broke things and we put in the entry to fix that issue. Then After the 2nd update we&#x27;ve added the auditing and we do see audit entries related to accounts that won&#x27;t work after the final updates. 
 We&#x27;re trying to get way ahead of this so we don&#x27;t have as many issues by the time all is said and done and honestly we&#x27;re really lost on how to handle this. We&#x27;ve been wondering if we need to automate the adjustment to all existing AD accounts and computer objects? Is this going to affect anything that makes an LDAP call instead of LDAPS? Are we overthinking it and it&#x27;s actually not a big deal and it all works itself out through all of the updates? 
 We just don&#x27;t quite understand everything that&#x27;s happening related to these updates and we&#x27;d rather cause some little bumps to get everything ready early versus one massive downtime issue when Microsoft sends out the last update and enforces the new encryption types.

 Today I have noticed a large increase in the emails being flagged by the &quot;Anti-spam outbound policy (Default)&quot; found in https://security.microsoft.com/antispam .
 Anyone else seeing this change? I contacted the users, they send these exact same emails daily and it&#x27;s never been flagged like this. I am wondering if Microsoft has tightened the definitions a bit?

It would help if HR told us when a user was no longer employed, but that is asking way to much I guess.
 ​
 Edit: Just to be clear, the emails to me are coming from the helpdesk. Getting them to submit tickets is not the problem, getting them to understand they do not have authority is.

                              <span>We had a customer report last week that they received an email from us requesting bank account details change. Normally I would put these down to the usual attempt but something is not right.
 Timeline:
 Email sent from genuine customer trying to make payment.
 Email returned to customer from a slightly different domain name with alternative bank details. It has correct email signature and some original text that one of my users has written.
 Customer queries with us and we realise what is happening and no payment is made.
 Provider contacted to block domain
 We use O365 and the user accounts have MFA. The password was poor for our user, so it has been changed to a new policy we are rolling out.
 Today it has happened again with a different customer and a different domain name - again very close to ours. They were going to make payment and the received a reply from a different domain but with text that looks like it came from us. One of the users involved is on holiday so I have disabled their login but this time a shared email account was spoofed. This account is disabled in AD by default (we are hybrid).
 Feels like we are being hacked somewhere. We are contacting our cyber insurance and I have requested the second domain be taken down. I have also reported to our email security/archiving company.
 Has anyone been affected this way before? What was the outcome?
 A worried thanks.

                              <span>Saw this PC gamer article last night. and immediately thought of this post from a few days ago.
 But then I started thinking - after decades of the &quot;older&quot; generation being just. Pretty bad at operating their equipment generally, if the new crop of folks coming in end up being very, very bad at things and also needing constant help, that&#x27;s going to be very, very depressing. I&#x27;m right in the middle as a millennial and do not look forward to kids half my age being like &quot;what is a folder&quot;
 But at least we can all hold hands throughout the generations and agree that we all hate printers until the heat death of the universe.

                              <span>Hey guys, just got hired at this new firm (60 ish employees) to be their one and only “IT guy”. We recently purchased some laptops and I’ve been tasked to create a golden image and have this installed on all the new laptops. Any recommendations on which software I should use? Or if we were to outsource this to a MSP, what would be an appropriate fee to pay? My background is in unified communications so I’m not 100% when it comes to real hardcore IT stuff. Thanks in advance!
 Update: thanks guys! Really appreciate the recos! Muacks ❤️

                              <span>I have a Dell X1052 switch, I have fully reset the switch to factory settings. The switch is using SW version 3.0.1.9.
 I setup a static IP on VLAN 1 that isn&#x27;t being used by anything else. When I attempt connect to the Web Interface I get the log in screen (using https) and after I log in I see &quot;please wait&quot; and then from after a minute or two I see on the console side that the connection is terminated but the browser gets stuck at Please Wait.
 Any suggestions on what I need to resolve this? Or should I RMA the switch, its got a lifetime warranty?
 Thanks,

                              <span>Hi all, i&#x27;ve read multiple sources even here on Reddit but i have a question for registry settings. We have a time sync issue with a hunderd of Synology NAS that can&#x27;t get the time from our PDCe.
 Is it right to configure HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32time\Config – AnnounceFlag &#x3D; 5 only on PDCe of the Forest Root Domain ?? All the other DCs in the forest (even other PDCe for child forest domains) and Member servers should have been configured with a value of 10.
 On the PDCe of the Forest Root Domain (the one that sync outside) what flag should i use for the peer list ? 0x1 or 0x9 ?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Still getting acclimated to this environment as the sole sysadmin - sorry if this is a dumb or obvious question. 
 We’ve got two Dell NX3240s running Windows Storage Server 2016 connected up to two PowerEdge R440s running an ESXi virtual server environment. When shutting the whole stack down, I’ve gone ahead and powered down all VMs and ESXi. Now on to the storage server. 
 Is there a best practice for safely shutting these things down? I’ve got a monitor, keyboard, and mouse plugged into them. 
 Since anything that would be accessing the storage cluster is powered down, am I good to just shut windows down, starting with the second storage server?

                              <span>Hi there,
 My manager wants to start using some form of MDM at our organisation, we haven&#x27;t used it in the past as the number of users and devices was negligible, but we&#x27;re at the point now where we need to start looking at implementing it. He is dead set on using Microsoft Intune/Endpoint Manager to do this. All our identity management is done via Azure AD. We essentially want to:
  
Allow users to log into any device using their Microsoft 365 account
 Deploy applications that the specific user is allowed to use, this should be able to be done on any device
 Push auto-updates, auto shutdown and remotely monitor devices
  
Is Intune/Endpoint Manager the ideal piece of software to do this? Are there any alternatives I could suggest even though my manager is dead set on it, as Intune/Endpoint Manager has so many features that we may not need? Also, are the requirements above feasible on Intune/Endpoint Manager?

                              <span>In order to increase room on the network for our rapidly growing office (with many lab devices as well), we decided to split the wireless network into a separate VLAN/subnet. That&#x27;s all well and good but our three printers (HP MFPs) are all Ethernet only. Our original subnet that remains ethernet based is 10.1.26.0 /24 and the new WLAN one is 10.1.29.0 /24. They are connected on the back end via our Cisco layer three switch and talk to each other fine. 
 People, when they&#x27;re hard-wired, are able to print with no issue as before. However, I noticed that when on the new wireless network, they are having trouble reaching the printers that they have added on the other, hardwired based subnet with the drivers they have (though of course they can ping and access the web interface IPs fine). So far the solution is to remove those old drivers (added through the basic Microsoft &#x27;add a printer&#x27; feature), go to the HP website and download/install the full official driver, skip past the step where it scans the network and can&#x27;t find anything, and then manually input the IP address of the printer on the other subnet of 10.1.26.0. This then seems to work for both the wireless and ethernet subnets. But it is a few extra steps and a bit of work for the users, who sometimes may get confused or don&#x27;t have time.
 Also, I noticed if you just use the basic Microsoft &#x27;add a printer&#x27;, &#x27;can&#x27;t find printer I&#x27;m looking for&#x27;, &#x27;manually enter the printer IP address&#x27;, it just finds some generic or universal print driver that is not the most descriptive or useful, as it can&#x27;t seem to find or offer an option for the actual precise driver.
 Anyway my main question is, is there a simpler way to do this, and advertise the printer easily and directly on both networks, or just make the existing printer installs on user machines work on both?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having an issue for a while where every time I reboot my PC the Xbox app gets pinned to my taskbar. I usually just unpin it and move on, but I finally got sick of it and decided to do something about it. I think I tracked the problem down to [C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\LayoutModification.xml]
 Is it safe for me to simple outright delete this file? If not, what does the default file look like so I can adjust it without accidentally breaking something? When trying to google the answer I get a ton of results on how make adjustments using it, but I can&#x27;t seem to find whether or not I can safely delete it.

                              <span>Yesterday someone tried to login to my Synology NAS through SSH. It was a bruteforce attack, so it was permanently blocked after they tried a few times. What worries me is that I really don&#x27;t know how have they done it. The SSH port that I&#x27;m using, which is not even the default (22), is only accesible through LAN and scanning it returns a closed port.
 Let me briefly describe my setup:
  
ISP router in bridge mode.
 Mini-pc running pfSense Community Edition v2.6.0.
 Synology NAS connected to pfSense.
  
​
 Pfsense config
  
upnp disabled.
 A few ports open for some of the NAS services, with the corresponding firewall rules.
  
​
 Synology NAS config
  
SSH is enabled and running on a port which is NOT open in pfsense. It is only accesible through LAN. I&#x27;ve tried accessing it through WAN and I can&#x27;t.
 SFTP enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 WebDAV enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 Torrent client running on a docker container. The TCP port is fixed and upnp is disabled on the client.
  
Was this hacker exploiting a pfsense vulnerability? Or maybe a Synology&#x27;s vulnerability? Or am I doing something wrong? Surprisingly, neither the SFTP nor the WebDAV had any intrusion.

                              <span>Hey there, 
 I would like to build some sort of GUI that my team can access through a regular browser that would run a powershell script using variables provided in the GUI and throws out the result. 
 For example I want to know which users are currently logged in on a Windows PC. I open the website
 search for &quot;Check logged users in a Workstation&quot;, get linked to the right page where i can enter the PC name, click OK and get the list of users requested. 
 Do you guys know any good tool to achieve this? Or have any ideas on how you would approach this?
 Thanks. 
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a class of 32 PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Version1809.
 Recently I&#x27;ve installed some software &#x27;Autodesk Inventor 2023&quot;. Since then. on around 2/3 of the PCs the domain accounts take around 10-15 minutes to load up, and when it finally logs in comes up with the error shown in the photo on this page (Except 2023 rather than 2019)
 https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Warning-1909-Could-not-create-Shortcut-Inventor-Electrical-Project-2019-Ink.html
 &quot;Warning 1909. Could not create Shortcut Inventor Electrical Project 2023.Ink&quot; when launching Inventor
 Any ideas what I can try. So far I&#x27;ve tried fresh uninstall and reinstall.
 Tried these instructions
  
Navigate to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk.
 Locate the folder labeled Inventor Electrical Library 2023.
 Right-click and select properties.
 Clear the Read-Only attributes at the bottom of the box and Apply. 
  
Also tried the master folder and subfolder and gave all users full access to read and write and modify where this shortcut is supposed to possibly be.
 I&#x27;ve also turned off Controlled folder access too via Windows Security. Local admin and network admin both log on.
 Not sure what else to try. Only thing I can think of is that the user domain accounts connect to a network drive and they can&#x27;t access their C:// drives (except admin). But obviously reads all the program data from the C drive.
 I&#x27;m baffled why it doesn&#x27;t happen on every single one though.
 ​
 Any tips for me to try?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Our server was hacked and everything deleted. The hacker wanted money to put it back. Luckily we had a backup file. But how can we make sure something like this never happens again?
 So far we have:
 - Deleted unnecessary user profiles (including the one used for this hack)
 - Banned the hacker&#x27;s IP address
 - Set the server to ban IPs for 24 hours after failed login attempts
 - Made extra backup files stored in multiple locations 
 Firewall was already on.

 The difference with me is that I have a mishmash environment. Two domain controllers - 2003 and 2008. The domain level is set to 2003. From 2003 I can not migrate to 2022 directly. But from 2008 already yes? I can&#x27;t find anywhere if after demote old DC 2003 and then upgrading the domain to 2008 I will be able to migrate directly to 2022. Only there is information about the R2 version. On File Services I have option to install Distributed File System and DFS Namespaces, DFS Replication.
 The next question is about the ip number of the new domain controller. I would like to leave the old ip number. That way I wouldn&#x27;t have to change the dns number anywhere.

 I have a problem and I can&#x60;t figure it out. Here is the ( https://imgur.com/ftNA1qc ) diagram about a part of the network, and the trouble. I have a Windows Server 2012, simple file sharing. When I try to pull the file from the server to the PC from the PC the traffic goes through the router 1, and I dont have a gigabit over the router, but when I copy a file from the Win Server to the PC it goes normally only through the Switch 1 with gigabit speeed. I don&#x60;t get it why it is going through the router? Same subnet ...
 Where should I start to trouble shoot? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 I need to upgrade a cluster from vSphere 6.7 to 7.0. The VCSA is already on 7.0. HA is currently activated.
 ​
 What is the best order for the upgrade? Would you attach the new ISO baseline to one host, then to the next one, etc. or to the cluster and remediate one after the other?
 ​
 Would you fully disable HA, or only do maintenance of single hosts?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

 We have a client who is currently hybrid with AAD Connect. They want to keep their AAD Connect to keep ADDS as the authoritative. Is this a supported configuration with moving away from Hybrid?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We have had a long running issue regarding Sophos XG Firewall. Users who log in to their laptops have access to the internet, and then when some lock their computers and come back to it, the heartbeats aren&#x27;t sent to the firewall and they&#x27;re blocked from accessing the internet until they restart the laptop.
 We have a 3rd party who provide the equipment for us and &quot;manages&quot; them, and we&#x27;ve been on at them for 18 months about this issue. Their response tends to be to run a piece of software that pulls the logs from the machine which is then sent to Sophos. We&#x27;ve done this for so long with no real solution to the issue. I get the feeling the issue is with Sophos as they don&#x27;t know (or care) why this is happening, so things are just stuck.
 I&#x27;ve been asked by my boss to find an alternative to Sophos XG Firewall, as a number of users are losing chunks of the day from having to restart their computers to get back on to the internet. The firewall must be user aware, so that we can apply specific rules to these users. 
 Can anyone suggest an alternative? One with good support would be advantageous.

I compared settings (DNS, IP, Hostname, custom setting) between a working and non-working IDRAC and they are equal.

 I found some Dell threads with people having the same issue, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a clear answer to me. 
 Anyone can help me out?

                              <span>Hey all!
 We&#x27;re experiencing an issue with some of the bigger call queue&#x27;s we have. We use Ringcentral integrated with Teams.
 The call queue is set on simultaneously
 When there is a member of the call queue out of office the other users will get an incoming call double (because of the Teams forward I think?). But when 2 users pick up at the same time, the caller is lost.
 Any one has an idea what&#x27;s going wrong here?

 I am currently using CIS Benchmark and it somehow breaks the system. Is there any option i can add to the command line so it only checks for miscofigurations rather than making changes to the system?

                              <span>Hey Guys
 What does everyone use for their &quot;what&#x27;s your computer name script&quot;
 I have used BG info in the past, but users don&#x27;t like it. Rainmeter was used in a past life but that was configured by the company that built the SOE at the time and looked way to complicated
 Looking for something easy. EG they double click on it, pops up a html page with the info. EG Computername, IP address etc

 Before we would stick a sticker and choose the name in SCCM during the build.
 But now with Intune and Autopilot you can&#x27;t do it and we can&#x27;t be bothered changing it in Intune as we would have to login to the computer etc. and that&#x27;s annoying and broke Azure AD once on the machine. I don&#x27;t mind if they are random but want to be able to get the name easy for the end user so we can connect using Spalshtop.

                              <span>I’m doing a migration for users from Gsuite (Google workspace) to Microsoft 365. One of the users was nervous because he’s currently enabled with IMAP and uses Outlook from his gmail account. The worry is, he organized folders and sub folders on his outlook already… will this user lose his folder structure after the migration to m365? 
 Note I will be utilizing bittitan for the migration. Thanks!

 Unfortunately they are not. Is there something i&#x27;m missing?
 does not resolve the issue:
 ipconfig /flushdns
 ipconfig /registerdns
 net stop/start netlogon 
 I&#x27;ve tried recreating AD and removing and readding it as well as DNS.
 ​
 I&#x27;m thinking of just rebuilding the server from scratch if i cant figure this out

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I am looking for help/suggestions on a cisco design topology. I have a project where I&#x27;m moving data between sites that are geographically distant. I want redundancy within this system that will be using cellular as its backbone.
 I have visited the locations and completed cellular audits of the signal, bandwidth, etc. Were happy with the speeds and it appears for the most part connectivity shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. But we cannot have tons of reliability issues. So redundancy is important.
 I have IR1101 cellular routers at my disposal. I have attached a drawing to show this topology.
 My questions is:
 How do I steer traffic to use one cellular connection as primary and when this connection fails use the other cellular connection? Policy based routing? if so, can you expand on how this actually works and maybe link something I can gather more information on the config its self. I am a working Network engineer but I have not done this specific config before. Funny enough, cisco makes this 100x harder than all other manufactures. Also costs 4x. But I have the routers so that&#x27;s what were running with.
 Key Notes:
 Cellular SIMs are Private static routable IPS. These are not accessible from anywhere outside of this Private subnet provided by carriers. Meaning The VZW sims can talk to one another, and the ATTs can. But not between the two carriers. In addition these SIMs cannot reach the internet. Internet cannot reach them. (this is a paid service from the providers)
 I am starting with simple site-to-site VPN tunnels. redundant setup. Tunnel 1 between VZW sims. Tunnel 2 ATT SIMs.
 With this setup, I figure all I need is to tell the router. &quot;Hey always use VZW Cell interface, if it fails, go out ATT interface.&quot; Since both cellular connections are live, and they both have tunnels. The failover is simply switching the interface the traffic is going out.

                              <span>hi guys!
 i just switched back to an iphone and got a big surprise ... none of the wifi scan app works
 after a little digging it seems apple blocked access to the metrics needed by thoses apps
 ​
 ive seen some post about the WiPry 2500x but the device cost 900$ ... might aswell keep an android in my backpack for that price ....
 is it possible to use other adapters like Alfa cards ? ore any other external device i could use for that purpose
 i already have a Netool.io so i can still perform network discovery and pcap etc... i only need a solution to monitor WiFi RSSI and see channels

Problem is when failover occurs. The inside interface is no longer passing internet traffic. I can ping the inside interface from the inside network but now internet traffic is allowed. I have been working with TAC forever and 4500 switch tack blames firewall, firewall tac blames switch. Because of the way the firewall fails over and keeps the same IP address but on the other firewall makes me think there is something with ARP table that is not allowing the IP to change for that MAC address. I am looking for any ideas. We are a manufacturing 24/7 so I can not just reboot the 4500. I have performed forced redundancy failures and it is not specific to which switch is the supervisor.

 ​
 After a long journey, I was able to regain control of six /24 IP blocks that my organization purchased back in 1992. I then put a few of these IP blocks to use, but have ran into a snag. Apparently, since these blocks have never been used on the outside internet, they were listed on the SPAMHAUS PBL. 
 The only information SPAMHAUS lists is the following:
  
Removal procedure 
 Removal of IP addresses within this range from the PBL is not allowed by the netblock owner&#x27;s policy.
  
The bolded is frustrating as I am functionally the netblock owner, yet I see no option for submitting a removal request anywhere. 
 My idea is to put in a ticket with ARIN and with Lumen(whom is our ISP), but wanted to know if anyone else had any tips or ideas?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Im using a brocade two icx6610 and the config is as follows 
 Switch 1: 
 Vrf mgmt1 
 Vlan 10 and a ve on that with ip 172.16.1.1/29 and in vrf mgmt1
 Switch 2:
 Vrf mgmt2
 Vlan 10 and a ve with ip 172.16.1.2/29 in vrf mgmt2
 Vlan 20 and a ve with 172.16.2.1/24
 Now the problem is vlan 20 dosnt always have a active link in it. When all the eth links in the vlan are down the 172.16.2.1 network stops being advertised and disappears from all routing tables. How can i keep it propagating with no links up?

                              <span>I am trying to troubleshoot why traffic from my router-based GRE tunnel is not taking the next-hop up ASA IPSEC tunnel to my destination site. Both sites are set up with a router configured for GRE using a Loopback interface as the source and destination at each end. However, I am not seeing the traffic from my A end routing over to the B end ASA via the IPSEC tunnel. 
 The IPSEC tunnel is policy-based using a crypto map and an ACL defining the interesting traffic to be the Site A Loopback IP going to the Site B loopback IP. And NAT statements are in place for that traffic. 
 Is there something I am missing? 
 Is there any

                              <span>I&#x27;m having some issues getting communication across one subnet in my network. I&#x27;m running a 10.0.0.0/26 net which has my access points on it. I have the control software running on a 10.0.3.0/26 net. I can ping the APs on the .0.0 net but 80 &amp; 443 (as well as probably the ports for AP communications) seems to be blocked. I have various web servers running on another 172.16.2.0/24 net that I can connect to just fine over 80 and 443. I don&#x27;t have any port forwarding rules set up or such. Running the latest version of Untangle as the router and using a Ubiquity switch in between. Haven&#x27;t had the issue with any other nets. Tried to specifically set a port forward rule and still didn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to help advise a friend, and would really value some guidance on how best to approach.
 This is a commercial space, with a suspended ceiling (concrete, with a 1-1.5m gap, then metal grid with gyprock). Here are some photos:
 https://i.imgur.com/u7NDv7G.jpg
 https://i.imgur.com/ethejqo.jpg
 https://i.imgur.com/HdHXRJp.jpg
 I noticed a few things with the existing cabling that seemed a bit strange.
  
Most of the cable is loose-laid over the ceiling grid.
 Some cables is zip-tied to threaded rods, that are used for the HVAC ducting (which I assume is somewhat better, right?).
 Several open plastic takeaway containers of liquid - not sure what it is? Maybe leaks?
 Several pieces of old clothing/rags up there - I assume from construction, or somebody left their overalls?
 Exposed electrical wiring
  
Firstly, does anybody know of any photos of a *good* data cabling setup in a suspended ceiling? (So I can show them what it should ideally look like).
 The closest I could find are these - but they don&#x27;t really show the final complete setup:
 https://i.imgur.com/pRtuEgN.jpg (Source)
 https://i.imgur.com/DhnwC2P.png (Source / Source)
 Secondly, what&#x27;s a way to describe to a non-technical person, why the above are issues? Or why it might cause issues when they try to add new cabling etc?

                              <span>First let me preface this with I have very limited networking experience, but I am at my wits end with a recurring issue that feels like no one else wants to figure out so I&#x27;ll learn how to. hopefully. 
 With this out the way, periodically (always during core business hours) we have really bad network performance, dropping packets from site to external, from site to data centre. But performance inside the data centre to internal devices is fine which leads me to believe that something on site is doing something to an external entity. 
 To give you some idea, we have site connected to a data centre via fibre and then from that data centre firewall out to the internet. 
 I don&#x27;t even know really where to begin with this, the only evidence of the issue is poor network performance, packets being dropped to servers in the DC and to the internet. Im hoping to be able to at least figure out where the traffic is being sent to and or from and from ether i can then figure out what and why and ultimately how to deal with this. 
 I apologise if this is not the kind of post you folks accept here.
 Thanks for reading

 Hope all is well
 I wish if anyone has worked with AT&amp;T and can help please do as I have been struggling since weeks.
 I have a connection to AT&amp;T with public IP address subnet assignment (/29) which I need to use statically on the FW in order to be able to establish an IPSEC tunnel to another location. 
 Juniper SRX -- Modem -- Internet
 The issue am having is am not able to ping from the FW (Edge device) to the Internet nor to the modem IP address.
 I have read through what so called IP passthrough and tried several setups with no luck.
 The modem type is : BGW320-505
 Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi! I am fairly new at my job where we mostly cater to Enterprise Customers - I have been supporting SMB customers in my previous job for the last 7 years - I am quite overwhelmed by some of the discussions and I am making efforts to really study especially the fundamentals to have a good understanding.. I&#x27;d like to take some advice from the people here in terms of what would be a good start in learning Network Design Fundamentals? Enterprise Networking to be specific, are there recommended trainings in Udemy, Linkedin, etc. that discuss Network Design and how to build a good and reliable design and understand its data flow as well. 
 Thank you.

                              <span>I am aware that a network professional should plan a site and choose appliances and brands depending on several factors, such as:
  
Reputation and Reliability: A brand with a good reputation for quality and reliability is likely to be preferred by a network engineer. This is because they need to ensure that the network is up and running smoothly at all times, and any downtime or failure could result in significant losses for the organization.
 Compatibility and Integration: A network engineer may choose a brand that integrates well with other devices already in use in the network. This can simplify network management and reduce the likelihood of compatibility issues.
 Features and Functionality: Different brands offer different features and functionality, and a network engineer may choose a brand based on the specific needs of their organization. For example, a brand that offers advanced security features may be preferred for a network that handles sensitive data.
 Cost: The cost of networking devices can vary significantly between brands, and a network engineer may need to balance the cost with the needs of the organization. In some cases, a more expensive brand may be preferred if it offers better performance or reliability, while in other cases, a more affordable brand may be preferred if cost is a primary concern.
  
Having said so, for our next school site (900 users) we could opt to continue using Ubiquiti devices which have an overall good price to performance and reliability ratio. However, within the community, there are several experts who keep on snubbing Ubiquiti as if it were an unreliable or less-enterprise grade devices.
 Given the the above brands, and the above thoughts, if you were asked &quot;Ubiquiti, why yes and why no&quot;, how would you reply? What is Ubiquiti missing compared to the other two brands, apart from a poor support, which is essentially community based?

                              <span>As the title says. I am trying to build a route-based VPN between an ASA and a NSX-V. If this might be better suited for r/cisco then feel free to let me know. The ASA 5515 is current NAT&#x27;d behind another firewall. Ports 4500, 500, and 50 are DNAT&#x27;d to the ASA. This is where my knowledge of networking starts to fizzle out as I believe a lot of the issues I am running into are because of NAT-T and potential limitations I might not know of or how to get around
 The NSX-V is connected directly with a public IP. I am connecting the on-site ASA to the cloud hosts NSX-V. In the snippets below the 216. is the NSX-V and the 10. is the ASA. All Phase 1 settings match and what is interesting is that if make a change to the tunnel on the NSX-V and save (like disabling and re-enabling PFS) the tunnel acts like it comes up on port 500.
  6 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 302015 10.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 216.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 Built outbound UDP connection 9147 for Outbound:216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) to identity:10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) 
 However after about ~30s I get this error and the tunnel continues to loop on port 4500
 4 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 750003 Local:10.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Remote:216.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Username:216.xxx.xxx.xxx IKEv2 Negotiation aborted due to ERROR: Auth exchange failed 
 I saw in this VMware article that states potential issues with NSX-T and IPsec with NAT-T. So I would assume that same behavior is to be expected with NSX-V. I configured the NSX-V to only be a IKE Responder so that only the ASA would initiate the tunnel but I havent seen any change in outcome. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77288
 As a test I tried to build a policy-based IPsec tunnel to a USG I get somewhat similar behavior where Phase 1 completed however after that the tunnel is torn down and the reason being User-Requested. 
 Just a little stumped, if anyone wants to toss some knowledge into my beggars cup. It would be much appreciated :)

                              <span>Hi Folks !
 I&#x27;ve been studying Spine-Leaf/Clos networking design for cloud native data centers for quite some time. Now is time to put the hands onto work !
 Where I live (Brasil), we do have few options when it comes to good equipments and fair prices. Mainly white box ones, being QuantaMesh and Arista the closest (EdgeCore models available are not ONIE compatible, so ...).
 So, for our case, based on price capabilities, we have the following models to be purchased :
  
Arista 7050QX-32
 QuantaMesh T1048-LB9A
 Nexus 2048T
 Nexus 3000 (3048TP) and 5000 (5596T)
  
The preference is for white box switches, and only Arista fits that requirement (we&#x27;re evaluating SONiC and Stratum primarily). QuantaMesh has models that does, but 10048-LB9A seems to not be compliant and doesn&#x27;t support ONIE.

 I happen to get my hands on an &quot;old&quot; Linkrunner Pro, which theoretically has the ability to generate Reports on a PC. However it requires the Software &quot;Linkrunner Connect&quot; which was supplied via CD-Rom- which after all those years- is lost by the previous owner.
 ​
 Do you guys have any hints, on how to connect? Will the newer LinkWare connect with this device,?
 ​
 Any help would be highly apreciated

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a reorganization of a relatively small data center into something resembling a decently designed, modular network. It&#x27;s of a size where it doesn&#x27;t need anything more than a collapsed core with ToR switches acting as a access. It&#x27;s going to be L2 access for now because of equipment availability. Also because of its small size, I&#x27;m not doing any overlay networking.
 However, some of the hosts are VMhosts like ESXi and it occurs to me that they have their, virtual switches internally. Other than providing basic VLAN infrastructure, they aren&#x27;t doing anything in terms of service provisioning, port density is a nonsensical concept for a vSwitch, and any interconnect to physical switches is, at most, going to be doing basic trunking/tagging.
 So, how do these fit into the outline of the infrastructure? I&#x27;m trying to get this design to be scalable -- small right, but possible to grow and evolve without major rip and replace of the whole thing rather than piece by piece over the years -- and data center networking is something I&#x27;m not deeply familiar with. Do you just ignore their presence, beyond ensuring there is no possibility of them causing L2 issues?

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 I’ve got this odd issue the with the VMware sdwan / Velocloud Edge 510-LTE. I have about 150 and randomly they drop their LTE interface. It’s just not there. The debug thinks so too. A reboot doesn’t fix, firmware upgrade doesn’t fix. I have to pull the power for a bit and reconnect to resolve. Across my fleet I’ve got usually about 5 with this issue. The SP can’t work it out and VMware’s reply is it’s not a priority so they get to it one day.
 Curious if anyone seen this ? I though initially heat related but I’ve demonstrated it’s isn’t. 
 Cheers 
 Matt

                              <span>Hola Amigos!
 I have recently been bumped into an Admin role and I&#x27;m still learning while working. 
 Our department will start a rollout project where the team needs to replicate the AD group memberships of one device(lets call it OLD) to another(NEW device).
 As the rollout team will be replacing an OLD device and provide the End User with a NEW one, they want to mass replicate the memberships as they will be targeting to replace about 15-20 devices a day. 
 I currently have a PowerShell Script that can perform this task but can only do 1-1. I also tried making a script(using google) that can perform this task but for bulk using a csv but I have not succeeded yet. 
 Could anyone please help me with this or tell me about a solution that they use regarding this task? 
 Cheers!

 UNI &#x3D; University (College)
 I am in need of advice. Small office shop here, 40 staff.
 We are getting a new staff member starting soon but they are a permanent remote worker, about 2 hour drive away from the office. (I can visit them in person if it is required)
 The issue is this new staff member will be working out of their UNI dorm.... off UNI provided wifi.... which is the same network as every other UNI student, dorm, cat and bloody dog. In the beginning of the year one of our biggest Universities in our region had a ransomware event and it still is not fully operational, this whole situation makes my spider senses tingle.
 Issue:How the hell am I meant to secure that computer? We have MDM, GPO&#x27;s, antivirus etc but usually you have a private network bet…</span>

 I have been asked to design a new super duper infrastructure fit for the business needs - great that&#x27;s something interesting to sink my teeth into.
 ....to then be told OTR that no matter how good my design is that this project will be farmed out to a consultancy to do the design for us - seems like a great use of my time.

                              <span>So, looking for advice on if this will work
 Have a public website with domain, currently using two nameservers at the registrar.
 Those NS&#x27;s are hosted by the same company, and if that company has an outage, none of my (A), (CNAME), (TXT) or (SRV) records are going to resolve.
 My thought is to setup a Hurricane Electric free DNS account at and add just two of their name servers as the third and fourth entry:
 ns1.he.net
 ns2.he.net
 T so if a lookup is made for any of the records during an outage of the first two NS, it will (FAIL), (FAIL), (RESOLVE he.net DNS).
 Now I don&#x27;t mind keeping the two DNS server entries up to date manually, there are like 10-15 records in total. But does anyone see any issue doing this that I am not thinking about?

                              <span>I swear I&#x27;m at my wit&#x27;s end with this issue, hoping someone can provide some insight: 
 We finally configured DMARC for our domain about a week ago. Everything was functioning fine, reports were coming in correctly, and then we decided to change the email we were receiving reports at to better filter them. Since then, emails to some domains (not all) are bouncing with &quot;554 5.7.5 Permanent error evaluating DMARC policy&quot;. 
 All our records are checking correctly with spf/dkim/dmarc checkers, and all the records have propagated out correctly.
 DNS host says check with your email provider (Google), Google says &quot;your records look fine, turn off DMARC or reach out to every domain you&#x27;re getting that error from and ask their IT to add you to a whitelist&quot;
 Is that the answer? Are we doing DMARC wrong? Our current record is just &quot;v&#x3D;DMARC1;p&#x3D;none;rua&#x3D;mailto:dmarc@ourdomain.com&quot;, still getting bounces.

                              <span>Small business network, 7 public facing web servers. Mostly IIS but several servers are running various versions of Linux.
 To this point the Network Administrator has had the responsibility of purchasing and managing the SSL certificates on the Internet domain registrar. No issue there.
 Previously, the Network Administrator stood up the base server, and the WebDev installed the Internet Web service. The Network Admin would download the appropriate Cert and private key and make it available to WebDev
 New people have come onboard as WebDev, and they seem to have the attitude that it is the Network Administrator&#x27;s job to maintain the certs on the various servers.
 QUESTION: Whose responsibility is it to install and maintain the certificates on the Internet Web servers? 
 A) Is is WebDev that installed and programmed the web server, or is it the
 B) Network Administrator who has been purchasing and managing the SSL certificates on the Internet domain registrar?
 EDITED TO ADD: Currently there are no set policies. The responses to this question will help determine a course of action to take in a Monday afternoon meeting. Thank you!

                              <span>Can anyone tell me why I&#x27;m getting so many of these weird requests to my server?
 I&#x27;ve been getting so many of these every day. Right now my fail2ban has 100+ ips in a banlist.
 A lot of the IPs are from Iran, and it seems the URIs they&#x27;re requesting is some kind of video stream? I thought it was advertising / accesslog spamming, but I looked up the hostname (sal5660.online) and there appears no record of the domain existing.
 IPs come from mobile providers as well.
 Was my server IP previously some kind of botnet C&amp;C or something?

 Any suggestions on a solution that has the same features? Looking to use SSO for it as well.

Technically, the submission email should come from the person who submitted the form. Instead, all the submission emails are coming from my email address even though someone else submitted the form. Is there a way to get the submitters email? 
 What i have tried so far but failed to solve the issue:
  
Get user profile (v2) 
 Turned on form setting to people in my organisation and record name option.

                              <span>I purchased an older switch off of ebay in order to upgrade my internet network at my home. I know enough to be dangerous, but I&#x27;m running into issues setting this up in my home network. 
 For my main controller, I&#x27;m running an Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro at 192.168.1.1. I have a few other subnets off of that, but this one for this switch is 192.168.4.0/24.
 I set the ip address of the switch as 192.168.4.2 255.255.255.0
 I set the default router of the switch to 192.168.4.1
 I then setup the dhcp-server pool...
 ip dhcp-server enable ip dhcp-server pool home network 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 excluded address 192.168.4.1 192.168.4.10 excluded address 192.168.4.100 192.168.4.254 dhcp-default-router 192.168.4.2 dns-server 192.168.1.1 lease 1 0 0 deploy 
 After setting this, I can run &#x60;show ip dhcp-server address-pools&#x60; and it shows me the correct configuration and that I have one active lease for the dhcp server pool, but for whatever reason either i&#x27;m missing something from here or i&#x27;ve done something wrong that just above my scope of knowledge. Either way, i&#x27;m looking for help. 
 Anything you can contribute I would greatly appreciate.

                              <span>During the 2020 lockdowns we got fairly settled with a remote working configuration that involves our remote team using RDP on a thin client of sorts, remotely controlling a remote Windows 11 Pro workstation (via a VPN). We then either use a work smartphone for VOIP calls, or using remote audio redirection via RDP. Remote audio redirection works OK if latency is low (under 30ms), but we now have someone who has over 150ms ping to their remote workstation. Unfortunately this causes VOIP calls to have a LOT of lag (probably about 1000ms latency or more) and is generally not great. Before I send out another smartphone, I wanted to do a little bit of digging to see if there are better remote audio solutions available.
 When doing some research I found that some people were experimenting with to passing through a USB audio device, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to do this on a Windows 11 Pro workstation - I enabled the group policy option for RemoteFX USB passthrough on my client PC but I still can&#x27;t seem to find this as an option.
 Other people have suggested installing VOIP software on the local machine - but having to flip flop between the local and remote environment sounds really annoying.
 The last thing I&#x27;ve discovered is a tool called sound-over-rdp, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any feedback as to whether it&#x27;s a good tool or not. It also is a little bit on the expensive side of things, would rather not drop nearly $3k AUD for 5 users / servers.
 I did also find an open source project called USBIP-Win that allows for USB redirection, but it seems pretty complex. I had a quick look at their github and I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;d solve my issue to be honest.
 Any suggestions on the best practices from here would be greatly appreciated!

 ​
 ​
 There are a lot of recommendations about the sizing of the windows page file. What I am looking for is the correct placement.
 ​
 We are using SSD disks on storage inside VMWare Environment.
 ​
 My questions are :
 ​
 1- Adding page files to other disks may increase performance up to the maximum ?

 2- if I put the Windows Page File (Pagefile.sys) on the same disk where database or log files are located. is it correct ?
 ​
 thanks,
 Kind regards,

                              <span>Hi,
 I have 1 email address linked to a custom domain. The domain is hosted on name.com, and the email is hosted via Microsoft365
 I&#x27;m able to send and receive mail from within my outlook client just fine.
 I followed the &quot;Enabling DKIM&quot; guide from learn.microsoft on the following link:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dkim-configure?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide
 Additionally, I also followed the github guide on https://github.com/duocircle/Office365-Setup-DKIM-DMARC-SPF
 By following the guides, I added 2 DNS records for my custom domain, and waited 24h to verify this in the dashboard. After 24h the verification succeeded, and the tool at https://security.microsoft.com/dkimv2 reported that DKIM was set up successfully. 
 However, 48h later, messages received from this email address still report 
 dkim&#x3D;fail (no key for signature) 
 In the header.
 SPF and ARC are both reported as pass.
 I tried to verify the DKIM records via an external tool (https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action&#x3D;dkim), which reports:
  No DKIM Record found 
 Could it be that I need to publish another TXT record with the shape?
 v&#x3D;DKIM1; p&#x3D;76E629F05F70 9EF665853333 EEC3F5ADE69A 2362BECE4065 8267AB2FC3CB 6CBE 
 And if so, does anyone know where to get this kind of information?
 I&#x27;m out of ideas on what to try, to make the DKIM check succeed.

                              <span>I wonder if there is a way to enforce a condition through GPO that if someone want to join PC to domain without Mcafee app being installed in the targeted PC it will prevent them from joining them to domain it&#x27;s like assessment checking if the application exist then it can be joined to domain.
 Other ways AFAIK deploying through SCCM, but I wonder if there are assessment check or conditions before joining to domain or am just dreaming. 
 This task should be performed by our Helpdesk support team but sometimes they tend to forget to install the application manually in the targeted PC. 
 Your insight is much appreciated

                              <span>When you rename a user account in Microsoft 365 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/change-a-user-name-and-email-address?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide), there seems to be some consistency problems for the end user and their local device profile, even if you rename their profile, or disconnect their device from the AzureAD domain and rejoin the AzureAD domain. 
 Example: I rename Ben Dover to June Doe.
 When the user logins in to their existing Windows device (AzureAD joined) with their new email address (ben.dover@domayn.co), the first thing Windows does is show a their old name (Ben Dover). Then if they click on the Start button, their profle icon (for Sign Out, Lock etc), shows their old name too.
 Even if you rename their user profile folder and the relevant registry key (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/user-profiles-and-logon/renaming-user-account-not-change-profile-path) the same symtons exist. 
 Anyone else experiencing this and know a way to resolve it?

                              <span>Is there a free or open source software like bitlocker where a laptop locks, you enter your name and customized location every shift to unlock it and then when you reconnect the laptop back to the internet it will send a report back to the people who need to see it? 
 We have an issue where staff is essentially stashing and claiming laptops and leaving none for the next shift. 
 So even if a software like this doesn&#x27;t exist I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;ll be pretty easy to make one but figured I&#x27;d ask here first

                              <span>Some valuable words of wisdom I&#x27;ve picked up over the years:
 The cost of doing upgrades don&#x27;t go away if you ignore them, they accumulate... with interest
 In terms of document management, all roads eventually lead to Sharepoint... and nobody likes Sharepoint
 The Sunk Costs Fallacy is a real thing, sometimes the best and most cost effective way to fix a broken solution is to start over.
 Making your own application in house to &quot;save a few bucks on licensing&quot; is a sure fire way to cost your company a lot more than just buying the damn software in the long run. If anyone mentions they can do it in MS access, run.
 Backup everything, even things that seem insignificant. Backups will save your ass
 When it comes to Virtualization your storage is the one thing that you should never cheap out on... and since it&#x27;s usually the most expensive part it becomes the first thing customers will try to cheap out on.
 There is no shortage of qualified IT people, there is a shortage of companies willing to pay what they are worth.
 If there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way to OpEx it
 The guy on the team that management doesn&#x27;t like that&#x27;s always warning that &quot;Volcano Day is coming&quot; is usually right
 No one in the industry really knows what they are doing, our industry is only a few decades old. Their are IT people about to retire today that were 18-20 when the Apple iie was a new thing. The practical internet is only around 25 years old. We&#x27;re all just making this up as we go, and it&#x27;s no wonder everything we work with is crap. We haven&#x27;t had enough time yet to make any of this work properly.

                              <span>We had an old windows 2012 physical production server failed a few weeks ago. We had DB and file backups for that server. So, we ended up rebuilding the server from the backups. But it still caused a lot of impact, like almost 2 days of production down, and missing a few days of data. 
 After that incident, the boss ordered us to convert all physical servers to Virtual server. We still have a handful of old physical 2012 mission critical running. We use hyper-v for our VMs. Converting is easy, but expecting doing it on the weekend to minimize business downtime. We don&#x27;t have a lifecycle for servers, if they are not EOl and still running, we just let them run.
 Most of those physical servers are old ,I think a better approach is creating new server and letting the application owner migrate the data out!

                              <span>Hi everyone. I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 laptop (Win11 Home) that recently had its motherboard replaced through repair. There was no option for me to suspend Bitlocker as the Windows I have doesn&#x27;t feature that and my laptop stopped working, so I didn&#x27;t prepare for that situation.
 Right now, every time I boot my computer, I am asked to input my Bitlocker recovery key, which is an inconvenience (I have the key backed up). I haven&#x27;t been able to find solutions that match with this situation as most posts online focus on non-repair related issues.
 The Lenovo technician told me this: It&#x27;s because the serial number on the motherboard doesn&#x27;t match with the rest of the laptop. He suggested me that I should reinstall Windows 11, but because it was active when I booted post-repair, I don&#x27;t think this would work.
 I also found out that there&#x27;s a BIOS update, along with some other Windows updates that were there for the three weeks I didn&#x27;t have access to the laptop. But given that the situation I&#x27;m in with the Bitlocker Recovery Key is due to a repair and not a software issue, how should I go about this?

I discovered that at least one provider (in Germany) excludes ICMP traffic from their data usage calculations, allowing you to purchase the cheapest prepaid plan with the least amount of data per month, set up an ICMP tunnel, and effectively have unlimited data.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know who this may help, but here it goes. If you are in the process of transitioning from IWA (soon to be deprecated) authentication to connect AD groups/users to vSphere to LDAP, there is an issue that you may run into.
 ​
 If you are using an account that is a part of the Protected users group in AD, that account will not work. You will receive an error stating that vSphere cannot contact the LDAP server along with an invalid credentials error. I assure you, there is no connection issue. This is likely the issue. I would suggest creating a separate account and make sure that it is not a part of the Protected users group. This should fix the issue and allow you to connect through LDAP.

                              <span>Hello, hoping one of you fine people have come across this problem with Remote Desktop. Most of the time when I log in to my win10 work pc the screen does this flashing thing as if it was trying to catch up or refresh. I can get around the system while it’s doing this but it’s super slow. It will do this for about a minute each time. Say I walk away and the surface goes to sleep it does the same thing after waking back up and reestablishing the connection. I have a shit ton of stuff up on my desktop so I figured that has something to do with it. If I reboot the work pc it won’t do it for a bit but that’s super annoying with all the stuff I have open. 
 Here’s the weird part - today I was trying on my girlfriends MacBook and the connection was flawless. Soon as I connected it doesn’t even flash once and I can move around the system within seconds. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I’m currently using the staged rollout feature attached to a group for testing 365 authentication through AAD rather than ADFS. That is working perfectly fine and everything works as expected. I’d like to enable that for everyone but unless I’m reading the documentation wrong Microsoft seems to have the end state being the decommissioning of the ADFS server. We still need ADFS for a number of legacy apps but just want to take 365 out. Is there any way to do this other than populating my staged rollout group with the entire company?

 This is barely above minimum wage in the UK. I hope they struggle to hire someone for this role as that&#x27;s an absolute pisstake salary. It&#x27;s crazy being in this community and seeing the salaries of our American counterparts and here in the UK, the pay for IT jobs seem to be getting stomped down regularly for some reason. &quot;Urgently needed&quot; as well, what a joke!

                              <span>It&#x27;s ridiculous that some &quot;sysadmins&quot; here will agree to facility requests, management problems, one-off end-user requests, and all sorts of other BS.
 You are system administrators. Not building administrators. Not user administrators. Not adult babysitters.
 If you can&#x27;t set boundaries for yourself and you say yes to every single request that lands in your office, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time in this field. 
 You&#x27;re in charge of keeping the systems up. That&#x27;s it. If the system is running fine, you&#x27;re researching, optimizing, and upgrading.
 Does the legal team investigate why the TV in the lobby doesn&#x27;t work? Do the accountants change the lightbulbs? Does the sales team find videos for HR policies?
 Quit being the company bitch. Your job is just as hard if not harder than anyone else&#x27;s there. Take some pride in your work.

                              <span>Hello Reddit, 
 I have been working as an sysadmin for 6-7 years and have always been dumbfounded that we have 4-5 WSUS servers, one for each of our customers VM environments that we host. I was told when I started that this was best practice when it was setup but seems like a big fat lie.
 My questions is as follows:
 1) Is it even possible to have 1 WSUS for all the servers for a more seamless environment or is it really best practice how it&#x27;s setup today. Seems like allot of wasted space.
 2) Would the WSUS server need to be on a domain?
 3) Does anyone have any tips what to do?
 Thanks in advance! 👍

                              <span>This is more a topic of curiosity than just hating on the cloud. I myself and very wary of the majority of computing being consolidated to a handful of major cloud providers. I know we here are not going to change the world as decision makers greater than us are driving this change.
 What am I curious is if any company of substantial size reversed their cloud journey. Move thing back to a data center when smart like VMs infrastructure. If so, what drove that reason? 
 My biggest gripe about cloud is the constant flux of change. It is almost impossible to mature what we are doing when the tech evolves rapidly every two years now. Half of Azure features always have a “Preview” tag on it. For me, the lack of stability would be my reason to not become a cloud first company. Not ignore it, but not see it as the answer to all my problems.

                              <span>Looking for a way to uninstall certain components like publisher and access from a current install of windows on several machines silently, and remotely. This would be the equivalent of going to the appwiz and clicking change and unchecking the components that are not needed. I am not looking to completely uninstall the application and reinstalling, which mean a ton of updates to install over again.

 Has anyone had experience doing this? Internet search yields no good results.

                              <span>So I was just talking about this with a friend. I have a small zip file of pictures of my wife and son. Obviously, all pictures are 100% appropriate for work. I like to have those images as a wallpaper as a slide show. So every four hours or so the image changes. 
 My buddy said that&#x27;s a security risk. I am aware of the practice of hiding data inside of images...but if I really wanted to do that I could probably find a way to do that. 
 Personally, I&#x27;ve found those background images to help me especially when your having a bad day. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi Sysadmin,
 So I’ve got a upcoming task at work this week. I need to replace 3 x old APC UPS Units with 3 x new APC UPS Units. I’ve never done something like this before, but it can’t be that difficult, right?
 I’m planning to do this out of hours. I’m thinking, first of all, shut all infrastructure down properly - this includes: 
 Sophos Firewall, User/Server Switches, Physical Servers, Physical Workstations, QNAP NAS Devices, ESXi hosts, Equallogic SANs. 
 Then, power off the current UPS units and unmount them one by one from racks. Remove one old and replace with one new. Connect all power cables as they were before, and power up the UPS’s. 
 Then just a case of confirming everything is back online and working as expected.
 Am I missing something? Anything important to keep in mind with this sort of task?
 I’m excited because these new UPS’s we’ve bought have NICs, so we can setup monitoring/alerts and check on them (if needed) remotely.
 Thanks!

 In the last few months, we have seen a concerning rise in instances where a clients mailbox gets comprised by a malicious actor and our org is then the recipient of phishing emails. Because the hacker has access to email correspondents between us and the client, contextually crafted phishing emails are being used. Our business is insurance and smaller clients often have little or no IT security and this is becoming a weekly occurrence.
 We are Hybrid 365 E5 with all best practice in place (MFA, CA policies etc). We have Mimecast in place and have worked with support to tune and harden it. We have MDO configured to Microsoft best practice as a 2nd mail security layer and a mature Knowbe4 security awareness program in place as well as multiple other layers of security (Fortinet, Group…</span>

                              <span>I ran the ForensIT profile migration wizard which migrates an existing profile to a new environment (from domain to workgroup, or vice versa). Doing so deletes encryption keys from Chrome&#x27;s &quot;Local State&quot; file, similar to changing a password, and Chrome lost the saved passwords. When the user logs in from the migrated profile, Local State&#x27;s encryption key is replaced, so tools like Chromepass don&#x27;t work, as it tries to use the new Local State encryption key. They didn&#x27;t login to Google to backup.
 I know the password from the old environment\profile, but switching the profile back still assigns a different SID. Am I screwed without the Local State file? Is there at least a way to find the encryption key? I can then add that to the Local State file and then use the user&#x27;s password to decrypt it.

                              <span>A couple years ago, the company I was working for was acquired by a much larger corporation. They never said my job was safe, but the people I was working with reassured me my job was going to be safe. Long story short, after a year, I completed a ton of migration work (pretty much everything) but immediately after I was sent on my way. (I don&#x27;t hold a grudge against them, I get it, they had teams to do what I was doing by myself.) I did all the sysadmin work and the netadmin work. We would hit up a trusted MSP if I didn&#x27;t know what to do with the networking side of things. 
 Before the acquisition I was doing everything outside of ERP work. I&#x27;ve been in the sysadmin role for over a decade. Anything Windows that you throw at me I&#x27;m fine with... Some linux i&#x27;m ok with. I&#x27;m pretty good with configuring network equipment, not super advanced. But I&#x27;m comfortable with configuring switches and firewalls. Not an expert, but I can work my way around it. 
 When recruiters hit me up, about 75% of them want some intro level NOC role. Others are trying for a senior networking role. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready for a senior networking role right now, but I think I could be ready within a couple months if given the opportunity. 
 Sorry, I&#x27;m kinda rambling because I&#x27;ve had a few beers and I don&#x27;t know what to do.
 I&#x27;ve had multiple interviews. I&#x27;ve made it known what I&#x27;m looking for compensation wise. So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m outpricing myself. But I&#x27;ve never even been lowballed with an offer. 
 I&#x27;ve gotten interviews but not for every job I&#x27;ve applied for, so maybe my resume is garbage? I just don&#x27;t know what to do.

                              <span>Hello everyone, Im pretty new in this field but I have some knowledge in security. However I am faced with a challenge in which I need some clarity and advice. I took up a new job at a company that sells ERP systems and I have been tasked with securing the client&#x27;s servers. Luckily and kinda unluckily too we run the system on windows servers.
 My superiors are currently adamant on keeping RDP open when the server is public facing so as to make any configuration changes remotely. I suggested to him that this is a very insecure method of operating and that is when he tasked me with coming up with a solution for it.
 Upon some research I came across the following:
  
Change the RDP port to a port outside the well-known ports range. This is cool, but it doesnt solve the problem since the port …</span>

 Has anyone gotten support from Microsoft and were they actually helpful or am i pretty much out of luck?

 The past two companies I have worked for barely have servers that you can play around with and if they do, you can only do so much on them because the IT teams either don&#x27;t let you touch certain features because they would break certain processes. I know I am very limited in my IT knowledge because I have been a level I-II tech for the past 6-7 years working for two companies and staying way too long at each. I thought this next company would be a good stepping stone. However I feel like I have gained just very limited cloud tech support knowledge with not enough experience in any major cl…</span>

                              <span>Config consists of a MX-01 that has bridge domains for layer 2 connectivity for directly connected devices. MX-01 has an Extended-Vlan-bridge to another MX-02 that has Vlan-vpls encapsulation with the interfaces directly associated to the VPLS routing instance. Which then this VPLS Instance extends the VLANs to the remote sites. MX-02 is a iBGP RR with dynamic tunnels to 10 other sites to create a full mesh. The issue that seems to be happening is the BD is re advertising learned MACs from the remote VPLS sites as its own. Indicating the wrong LSI reachability. And also randomly creating loops with the MAC addresses.
 Is this just the nature of the beast in this setup? Or is there a way to prevent VPLS from readvertising learned mac&#x27;s across the LSI&#x27;s? Or would EVPN be a better fit?

                              <span>I use gateway redundancy on Juniper MX routers based on EVPN, bridge-domains, IRBs with same IP/MAC and ESI-LAG to switches. I have a deployment where it has worked flawlessly for several months already. Some time ago I tried to deploy same design to other site that has several times higher MAC/IP count, specifically around 5k MACs and 30k IPs across many vlans. First problem I ran into, was per-interface MAC and MAC+IP limit in bridge-domains. I figured out how to increase those limits and decided to try again. To better describe what the config looks like, at the bottom of the text there is example of config. The configuration of second router is similar. I did not include BGP with family evpn but EVPN signaling works fine, I checked that by elected designated-forwarder on both routers.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got myself stuck trying to work out how much of our 1Gbps uplinks between switches are being utilised. Our monitoring pulls back input bandwidth and output bandwidth, and our uplinks are fibre with 1Gb SFPs.
 So if the output bandwidth is 100Mbps and the input bandwidth is 100Mbps, then the total bandwidth would be 200Mbps. But because it&#x27;s a fibre pair how does one affect the other? Is there 1Gbps up and down simultaneously or is the bandwidth limited by the SFP?
 Any pointers gratefully received.

                              <span>Hi there, I am overviewing as a consultant a network implementation plan in a school, however I suspect that the property of the school to save on costs has asked the general contractor, who is in charge for designing the infrastructure, to follow a minimalistic approach.
 WIFI access points are for now designed to be in corridors instead that in classrooms! See a frame captured from the building plan: https://i.ibb.co/BghXC0F/Screenshot-79.png
 Don&#x27;t you think this is a bad WIFI design? Can those APs satisfy network requests once the school will run 1:1 devices in each classroom? Will high density APs be required? Walls are basically plasterboard partitions....

Legal approved to start fresh and delete all past data. I noticed that Some stuff in the system is gathering data correctly but other stuff is just showing errors and has wrong configurations. Is there anyway to just blow out the current data on ADAudit Plus and start fresh?

                              <span>Hi all. Wondering what the consensus is with regards to versions of Apache and/or Tomcat that come via a Vendor supplied app or package. That is, software x comes as a product but underneath the hood, it&#x27;s all driven by an Apache backend. Are you handling updates to Apache outside of the vendor or are you having to lean on the vendor to supply an entire new package with inevitably already out of date versions of these packages?

 Some how our C level management got the idea that they wanted to be a company that bases themselves on higher education employees. Our IT manager at the time hired the best fit for the job before this but was strong armed into preferring college graduates. The manager was forced out because he pushed back too much, so they hired a new manager named Simon about six months ago. Simon was a used car salesman until about 8 years ago then he got an IT management degree from a for-profit college. Since then he has spent about a year or two at each job, “cleaning them up” then moving on. He has no technical ambition and thinks a lot of it is stuff you can just pick up.
 On his second day, Simon pulled all of the system and network admins into a meeting (about of u…</span>

                              <span>I got hired in as a System Administrator role in an $100 million revenue Automotive company about 6 months ago... this job is so stressful, and I feel so under qualified. I worked as a mom and pop hardware shop PC repair technician before coming here and was very forthcoming with my skills, knowledge, etc when I interviewed for this role and they hired me.
 It felt like a lucky break and I was so excited to work in a real professional and corporate environment under an IT professional that has been in the biz for almost 30 years. 
 This was not what happened.
 My RM set me down and introduced me to a Team I&#x27;d be working with for support that i needed and they are based in India so I could come to them with any help I need. 3 weeks later, my RM leaves to UAE as well for an indefinite amount of time. Before he leaves, he gives me the most barebones training ive ever received and basically just told me to watch and learn and ill pick up everything i need that way. Every time I need access to something or to help someone out, I have to reach out to someone on my Team in India to grant access, monitor bandwidth, configure DNS, you name it, I pretty much have to ask someone to assist me because either I don&#x27;t have the tools, or the understanding. Maybe it&#x27;s a good thing as I don&#x27;t know exactly what to do with the tools in the first place.
 Is this normal to be hired in like this and feel totally out of place and just constantly questioning if I&#x27;m doing a good job? Are there any tips anyone could give me or maybe empathize a bit?
 Any support is appreciated, 
 Much thanks!

                              <span>In 2020 it was revealed that Finnish psychotherapy clinic Vastaamo had suffered a data breach and patient records of over 30 000 people had been stolen. Many details on this might be interesting to sysadmins. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vastaamo_data_breach)
 Now the case is in court and details about Vastaamo&#x27;s IT systems have been published. Ville Tapio, Ex CEO of Vastaamo is on trial for data protection crime. Suspected hacker has been detained and is being investigated for aggravated data breach, aggravated dissemination of private information, and extortion.

                              <span>Microsoft licensing is obviously confusing as hell and our VAR reps do not seem to have the answers to this question. We do not use O365 (we are on GSuite) but we do want to get Intune working to manage Windows devices. Our main requirements are to get Autopilot working so that we can just mail new users laptops without having to image, use Intune to manage endpoint policies, and use Intune to manage updates (especially feature updates) for older versions of Windows 10.
 When I researched this previously the &quot;EMS E3 (Enterprise Mobility + Security E3&quot; license was supposedly the best option to get all of this. Our VAR seems to think, however, that this does NOT include Autopilot or the ability to push feature updates. Does anyone know if it does or does not? We would likely not use the security features (currently on Crowdstrike) unless it integrates well with our other security products. We are a non-profit so we are hoping we qualify for the non-profit licensing discount but our VAR also thinks that we may not (no idea why they think this). 
 We were also recommended to use this 3rd party site which also makes it seem like EMS E3 does not include Autopilot. However other people have told me that it does and that this site is incorrect.

 edit: This link makes it sound like EMS E3 MIGHT be all we need? But it is not quite clear:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/licensing-requirements
 TLDR: What is the cheapest licensing option to get us Intune + Autopilot + Windows Feature Updates patching ?

                              <span>It has been YEARS since I&#x27;ve setup SNMP from scratch (actually, only in lab 20 years ago) and I&#x27;m getting old.
 SNMP server installation and setup was easy. No problem with the community name, read &amp; read/write, starting the service, etc. But I&#x27;m missing something.
 I want to setup the SNMP service on the network so that we can leverage the native SNMP capabilities in Domotz. I want to get any/all SNMP alerts transmitted via the Domotz client to a distribution group.
 BTW - this network has NEVER seen SNMP. So it&#x27;s a brand new installation.
 But something doesn&#x27;t feel right. I think I&#x27;m missing a step with configuration? Or security? We&#x27;re only starting with SNMPv2 at the moment. I have no idea how to setup v3 yet.
 Any ideas here? Any way to confirm its functionality? Most of the papers I&#x27;ve read have been awful.

                              <span>Microsoft has been encouraging the use of modern authentication for years, yet one of the most common applications in the world, the current version of Adobe Acrobat (Reader included), does not support it. If you try to establish a connection to (business) OneDrive or SharePoint, it&#x27;ll just stall out and do nothing, not even apprising you of the issue.
 That is, unless your 365 tenant still has the SharePoint policy which controls legacy access on &quot;Allow,&quot; then it works fine. But we don&#x27;t and don&#x27;t want to revert that setting just for this.
 Adobe is obviously a major company with the resources to have upgraded their products for this a long time ago--many others already have, including much smaller companies like Foxit. This leads me to wonder if it&#x27;s purposeful: maybe they want you to use the Adobe Cloud instead of SharePoint.
 There&#x27;s a sad little UserVoice entry about this with 8 votes currently (I think more reflective of the obscurity of what the problem is, perhaps combined with many tenants still not going to modern yet, than lack of interest):

                              <span>Preferably open source, preferably free, definitely hosted in-house, but anything that isn&#x27;t too ridiculously expensive would be considered.
 There&#x27;s so many options, most of which either a) have zero documentation, not even system requirements, b) won&#x27;t tell you what it costs until after a demo (that will inevitably be a waste of time with high pressure sales pitches), c) obscenely expensive (with subscription fees), or d) so complicated to set up as to be impossible (see a)).

                              <span>Just had an interview with a company that reached out to me on LinkedIn. It was for a sysadmin position. I get on the interview, and they&#x27;re looking for someone who can:
  
Do T1 Support for all their staff (worldwide)
 Do sysadmin duties like maintain their inventory/MDM
 Build out on-prem infrastructure and networks
 Deal with office facility issues, like changing light bulbs or calling a plumber. Because that makes sense.
 You are on your own, for the most part.
  
I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to say compensation expectations in an interview, but when asked, I gave my range. I thought, surely the pay would be massive to compensate with the laundry list they want this person to do. They came back with, &quot;that&#x27;s pretty high, and a lot more than we envisioned for this role.&quot; Cool, hire someone else then, because that&#x27;s my worth in this position!
 By the way, this is not a small company. I&#x27;d consider this a mid-sized global ~300 person company.
 These hybrid roles that mix several departmental duties on one person are getting way out of hand.

                              <span>For context our offices are western US and the agent is WFH in eastern US. Ex-employee reached out about a month ago with USB issues on his device. No worries there just instructed him to ship the broken laptop back to me once he received the new one I had prepped and shipped to him. Not too difficult
 Well the employee no call no shows his job after the second laptop showed as delivered and his managers are unable to get a hold of him. 
 I instructed finance I believe it to be wise to withhold his final paycheck until we receive our equipment. Sadly finance did not heed this advice maybe due to certain laws I&#x27;m unaware of, But we are now out the two devices and my parent company is telling me I need to follow up and get them back
 How do I proceed with something like this? Is local police an option in this context? 
 Thanks for any advice.

                              <span>Close to me, a company&#x27;s azure admin account was compromised and Microsoft sent them an invoice of 300K+ that only took the perps 4 days to spend. 
 ​
 That makes every azure admin a whale.
 ​
 This is not a post mortem post, instead I want to know how a decent whale organizes his workstation with security in mind, also to endorse/enforce this best practice to his henchmen. 
 ​
 These are the dimensions in that warped space :
  
use multiple VM&#x27;s and RDP into them / use an RDP manager
 you can have multiple Displays
 
you can use the Workspace feature
 you can use RSAT tools / PS remoting
 per RDP session you can configure whether 1 or 2 displays are involved
 some mice have programmable buttons that help you scroll thru Workspaces
 you can use 65&quot; TV screens if you want, IT is not poor where you work 
  
​
 These are the limitations:
 Must use 2 identities: a personal and an admin identity
 The admin account can not have access to Outlook or internet : vsphere/zabbix/jira .. only 
 The bare metal should be a Jumpstation as per MS best practice
 At least one VM for personal Identity, where Outlook lives and for general/genuine Internet work
 ​
 ​
 Challenges
 Many admin task involve cookbooks .. that are online.
 Workspaces are great until you discover that VM&#x27;s you RDP into have workspaces as well. Your programmable mouse gets confused/freezes, forcing you to use the keyboard to &#x27;pop&#x27; into the right level.
 You have to screenshot an error on a VM, but then waste time to find where your Outlook instance lives to get it sent to the ERP people.
 Running wayland on the bare metal for your three monitors isn&#x27;t plug and play, nor is getting portreps working in linux
 You want Teams running as a singleton in your setup, but discover another instance has the camera locked. Or fights with Skype for Business for the dial tone.
 Your employer expects you to multi-task, obviously.
 ​
 ​
 How can it be done ?

 I am finding myself having to be super careful when giving a suggestion or recommending some improvements because some of the more senior members of the team don&#x27;t seem to like it, I feel some of them see it as I&#x27;m trying to challenge their knowledge or the hierarchy. Is there ever a win win situation here?

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m a one-man shop and I&#x27;m supporting an environment with a domain controller on 2012R2. I&#x27;m replacing this device as it is EOL in October, I need some help with best practices and ease of transition/migration.
 I&#x27;m not planning on performing an in place upgrade, I&#x27;m working on getting new hardware and licenses for a fresh install.
 I&#x27;ve read some information about adding the new server / DC to the existing one and then making it the primary and feel like this is the best way to go...however I want to add an additional difficulty into the mix. Currently the domain name is named with a prefix &quot;abc.TLD.com&quot; Since I&#x27;m not doing an an in place upgrade I want to fix this and change the domain name to just the TLD. I&#x27;m also not sure why this was done in the first place, is there any particular reason to do this that I might not be aware of?
 I want to hear your insights from anyone that has had to go through this on what is the best path to take. I&#x27;m primarily concerned with the downtime a new domain will cause as some of the equipment wont know how to find their dependent servers using DNS as well I&#x27;m concerned that permissions will be broken and how to best go about moving over OU&#x27;s and security groups etc.

                              <span>Starting off with the caveat that I am pretty well employed and salaried at the moment. But I&#x27;m far from an entry level position. 
 My frustration comes from my personal email being absolutely flooded with recruiters offering absolutely terrible wages anywhere from $14 to $19 dollars an hour, mostly for helpdesk but on occasion for more specialized/skilled job roles. 
 Or my friends/colleagues/people I meet at conferences/seminars etc who manage larger IT departments than I do complaining about not being able to quality help desk/generic PC support techs. They talk about people talking themselves up in interviews and ending up being completely incompetent. When I ask what they&#x27;re looking to pay it&#x27;s always $16-20 dollars an hour, but inevitably the pay isn&#x27;t up to them but some idiot in HR…</span>

 When trying to &#x27;move&#x27; a call between Mobile and Desktop, the &quot;Join&quot; button on the Teams desktop client does nothing. 
 I am able to move from Desktop to Mobile. This is happening with multiple users and multiple computers in our organization. Teams is updated (1.6.00.1381 (64-bit)) and I&#x27;ve tried to sign-out, and clear cache.
 To be clear, I&#x27;m talking about &quot;Join a Teams meeting on a second device&quot;. Clicking the Join button on the desktop app does nothing.

                              <span>I recently got authorized for a considerable amount of money to invest in our IT department. What should I invest it towards? We are a k-8 school that utilizes Chromebooks, macs, ipads etc. They&#x27;re pushing for STEM programs also. I was thinking of putting it towards some MDM or other monitoring/security programs or even something that would reduce administrative overhead. Any suggestions?
 Edit: we have a little over 200 students using Chromebooks as well as about 30 plus staff that use eye devices or their personal cell phones. They used to use jamf but they stopped using it they were also using netvision but also stopped using that so they&#x27;re going off of Faith at this point and I&#x27;m trying to configure whatever I can through Google workspace which is what they have the devices on.

                              <span>Hello all!
 I just started at a new company and its my first time working with shadow volume copy. Shadow copy is setup and set to go to a different hard drive. We have set limits (screenshot below) but we have one file that is 90.9GB in size and I can&#x27;t figure it out. Does anyone have any ideas of what it could be or where I could look?
 ​
 I also noticed that the big file name is at the end of all the other files.

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello fellow Sysadmins. 
 english isn#t my native Language so keep that in mind &#x3D;) Thanks in advance.
 First some information about the setup: We are using a SRV2019 Standard as an AD/DNS/DHCP Server. Newest updates and so on.
 Recently we had to register a website with a special character (ü) in the domain name field. When i try to resolve the name with nslookup  i get that the domain has not been found : Server failed. When i try the translated XN- adress it works. Is there a way to enable the translation of XN-Adresses(IDNs) ? I&#x27;ve tried to google obviously but the results are very bad. 
 Also when i do a nslookup from my homecomputer (W11) the address is translated to the XN-Adress.

                              <span>Hi everyone. I wanted to share the documentation for a project I&#x27;ve been working on in the school district I work at. If you&#x27;re not familiar with RDS, it basically allows large amounts of users to rdp into a host or hosts that have a shared resource pool, and Guacamole is a browser based RDP server. This will allow us to cut back on computer labs and allow students to use windows based software on their chromebooks. When I set out to make it this way I could not find any clear documentation on how to set this all up and have Azure SAML working so I wrote some up in case anyone else wants to give it a try!

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m little bit out of options with this one. Please advise. 
 The environment:
 Few Windows and Linux servers on the same network, which itself is firewalled, but no firewalls between servers in the network. One downstream WSUS server that&#x27;s keeps Windows servers in the network up to date. No domain or DNS.
 Two of the servers are Windows 2019 SE HYPER-V hosts with few VMs. Let&#x27;s call them HPV01 and HPV02. 
 Apart from the purposes of the VMs and IP addresses, these hosts are identical.
 HPV02 now lost the ability of accessing some shares on the network. There was no change in the configuration. Shares from the server itself are still accessible by others. The error message:
  
Network Error
 Windows cannot access \10.0.0.11
 Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose. 
 Error code: 0x80070035 The network path was not found. 
  
The address is correct, perfectly accessible from all the other servers in the network. Even by the VMs on the affected host. 
 It also lost access to the WSUS share by IP, but it&#x27;s possible to access this share by WSUS server name, even tho there&#x27;s no record in the hosts file. (how?)
 I tried all the possible solutions I could find on the internet. Lot of them for example here.
 Thank you for any advice.

                              <span>Hey guys, I recently installed Zabbix and I am using the Windows Template by Zabbix Agent2. It’s pulling in a lot of info. I mean every single service that’s running. What templates do you use and what are some of the most important things to monitor on let’s say a DC with DNS ? Or a share point server.
 What templates do you use besides the Windows one by Zabbix ?

                              <span>Hi, we are using proxmox, it is an older version, VE 5.4, yes I know it is not supported anymore and we are planning an upgrade soon. We have 3 physical servers in a cluster.
 But we are having an unusual problem with it for some time now. It randomly freezes and nothing can get it back except reboot. Keyboard input, network, VMs, GUI, everything is down. If we connect monitor to the server we can see CLI, but unable to interact with it.
 Error that repeats itself in the logs just before the cluster freezes is: kernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.h:47!
 We did some research and only documented case I can find is from oracle https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/2903057_1.html. But we dont have an oracle account and can not see the article.
 My question is if anyone had the same issue, if yes did you manage to solve the it? Or if it is ok to ask that here if anyone has an oracle account and is willing to send me the info from the article mentioned abovo, of course if there is something of interest for this specific problem in the article. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>This is happening across probably five or six vendors over the last year. Like the title says, if it isn&#x27;t a critical P1 outage, the vendors seem to express zero interest in coming to a resolution for my problem in a timely fashion.
 With currently two of my tools from two different vendors that we are paying good money for, there&#x27;s so many issues that are affecting the usability of the tool that it&#x27;s practically worthless in it&#x27;s current state and we are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a tool that we can&#x27;t use because of issues with it. I have had to reach out to our CSM multiple times for both companies because the support technician keeps on saying that he will get back to me by the end of the day but two days later I haven&#x27;t heard anything. I reach out to the CSM, and then magically within a few hours I have a support engineer beating down my digital door asking when we can schedule a phone call. The phone call takes place, I give them what they need, they say that they will get back to me. 2 days goes by with not a peep from them. Re-engage the CSM, and the cycle repeats. 
 With our firewall vendor, it takes an average of 8 days for a resolution, even the most simple of changes. I&#x27;ve brought this up to management multiple times and they say that we don&#x27;t have the manpower right now to take our firewall duties in house nor do we have the manpower to research and negotiate a contract with a different firewall management company.
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a staffing shortage or just poor management, but this is incredibly frustrating because I have management at my company asking why these issues aren&#x27;t resolved yet and I hate shrugging my shoulders and telling them that I&#x27;m in a perpetual state of waiting for support to get their act together but it&#x27;s the truth.

                              <span>I am dealing with a cert issue on our on prem exchange 2016 server. Our main email domain is different than what was used on-prem also. Newbusinessname.com vs OBN.com (if that makes sense). The cert on the on-prem machine is for the OBN.com and half our users don&#x27;t even have that alias anymore, just the newbusinessname.com as their primary. There are no mailboxes on it, it is just a smtp server at this point or used to create new accounts. Accounts are on-prem by synced to Azure. All email is using Exchange online. First, do I even need this on-prem server? Second, what is the real need of an on-prem server? I am guessing I need it to handle the on-prem accounts email attributes. 
 I am just tired of cert errors and users being prompted for passwords for the old exchange server that just sits there and relays an email every now and then.

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best way to go about recreating Python&#x27;s virtual environment functionality, for a nice fresh Windows install? 
 I&#x27;m looking to create a persistent, separate clone of my installation that can handle its own program installs, config, etc without affecting my &quot;clean&quot; install. 
 If it sounds like I want Windows Sandbox, kind of - but I want it persistent. I know I could make a recovery image of my current windows install, but I&#x27;m trying to AVOID needing to restore to a previous date, and I want to use both &#x27;environments&#x27;. I considered using a VM with an image of my setup, but AFAIK I&#x27;d end up with significantly reduced performance. Lastly, I know SOME applications allow you to install to single users, but some of the tools I need required admin. 
 The end goal is to keep my work tools separate, along with their associates config / dependencies / quirks within Windows; while my &quot;main&quot; environment stays clean and proper. 
 I know very little about Docker, but I wondered if I could put all those apps&amp;dependencies into a container, and run them that way?
 Appreciate any input.

 We’ve recently hired a couple of Helpdesk technicians and looking to document their training needs as well as training that has been provided. 
 Just wondering if anyone has a templated document that they currently use before I start building one. Appreciate every business is different. 
 Just don’t want to re-invent the wheel so to speak. 
 Cheers,

 I say this means we need thre connections, my colleague say&#x27;s we just need two. 
 Who is correct? There is a Semla-bun at stake.

                              <span>Hello,
 it is me. Again.
 I am lost on this one and hope to find some aid.
 For my organization I have setup an IKEv2 VPN on our firewall. And it seemed to work fine, as my coworkers all use it without problems. But a few days ago one of our users approached me and asked when their problem is &quot;finally solved&quot;.
 Which problem? I wasn&#x27;t aware that there even is a problem.
 We had a few major internet outages three weeks ago, but those were resolved by our ISP. But since then, their VPN connections drop regularly, like every 1-2hours. The users thought, that these two problems were somehow related.
 While windows is still telling them, that the VPN Connection is connected, the firewall already decided to drop the connection, probably because of the DeadPeerDetection.
 I don&#x27;t know who to ask exactly. The firewall is a fortigate. The OS is windows, and the vpn profile is setup in Intune.
 Does anybody have a tip for me? What can cause such a behavior?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;d like to set up centralized Log Management for our Company.
 I&#x27;m kind of new to that topic and thus looking for recommendations...
 What we would like, if possible, to collect Logs from:
 On prem (across VPN connected locations):
 - vSphere Clusters
 - Virtual and physical Windows servers (Server 2016+)
 - Virtual and physical Linux servers (Centos7, Rocky Linux)
 - Various Cisco Networking Devices (can forward to e.g. rsyslog)
 - Possible Windows Clients as well?
 Also we&#x27;re running machines/endpoints/containers on:
 - MS Azure
 - GCP (Google Cloud)
 - OTC (Open Telecom Cloud)
 We&#x27;re monitoring environments (at least part of them so far, WiP) with Icinga2, so integrations to that may be nice as well.
 So far I took a quick glance at Graylog and ELK, they seem to be the most prominent and obvious choices to look at. But I&#x27;m unsure about what of our environment may or may not be supported, so experiences are very welcome.
 Of course, alternatives to the two are as well.
 Thank you! :-)

 At first we&#x27;ve deployed the script using user configuration but it&#x27;s not ideal because it asks an admin prompt. So we&#x27;ve done it using computer configuration but it just doesn&#x27;t want to be deployed.
 Is it a recurring problem scripts that doesn&#x27;t work as GPO? Or is it just us?

                              <span>Does anyone try to make AD mirror their organisations HRIS systems?
 For computer users that&#x27;s easy (already in place) But for non computer users, can an account be created which resembles more of a placeholder or contact?
 I&#x27;d really like our Active Directory to be as closely aligned to HRIS as possible but for all the users who don&#x27;t actually log into a computer this seems not so straightforward.
 Just in case your wondering what some use cases for this crazy ask is....
 I need to add all internal company phone numbers to the global address list and as HRIS is always the source of truth which syncs to AD, it seems logical for the users in the organisation to all appear in AD whether they are a computer user or not.
 Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you as always, wysadmin&#x27;s

                              <span>Hi All, 
 Has anyone been seeing long delays with opening Safe Links re-written in Outlook and Teams?
 Delay can be anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes.
 Started yesterday for our tenant (UK) and still seems to be on-going.
 Opened a support case with Microsoft who initially advised that it was expected but pushed back mentioning that the delay is not normally this long. 
 Have since been told that a sync object repair has been initiated and to wait 24 hours. 
 Obviously I could turn off the safe links policy in the meantime but would rather not if I can help it.

 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

We have users trying to connect to our enterprise network and they often struggle with the settings on Android, so they call our support and this is quite a headache to make them to configure the 802.1x wi-fi on their phones I&#x27;ve tried several parameters from this website : https://jasonmurray.org/posts/2020/wifiqrcode/ Either with the barcode app or the QR-scanner in the system settings but it doesn&#x27;t work. There&#x27;s very few documentation about it, are any of you managed to make valid qr-codes ? Thanks in advance !

 I feel like my manager doesn&#x27;t know how much I contribute! Very busy day to day! On the other hand, another member within the team, I feel like he just play on his phone all day...
 Should I redirect all the requests to my manager and ask the manager to delegate all the tasks and request within our team???

 ​
 anyone know how to the retrieve the product license key for windows server 2016 standard * DELL OEM* version
 ​
 slmgr returns only the last 4 digits or so, and the original license keys docco / sticker is gone.
 ​
 failing that on reinstall will it activate with the already activated license key (given hardware hasn&#x27;t changed)?
 ​
 hope that all makes sense.

 I have looked at:
 - GPO (only default domain policy is applied to everyone)
 - Fine grain password policy (we have none)
 And can&#x27;t figure out why the one user cannot reset their password due to &quot; This password does not meet the length, complexity, age, or history requirements of your corporate password policy.&quot; in SSPR
 They have the same license as everyone else in which they all have no issues resetting their password.
 We have a hybrid AD setup where Azure AD has been setup on an on-prem domain controller connecting to Azure.
 Is there anywhere else I can look at to troubleshoot?

                              <span>We have an older application that was administered by an older, career, administrator. Well, he hit his 30 year mark and retired (to be fair he earned it). 
 We hired a younger system administrator and he assumed administration of a number of services, to include the application mentioned earlier. 
 The vendor of said application no longer exists, but we’ve been able to keep it running on a windows server 2012 R2 (ha remember service packs?!) virtual machine. 
 Well, windows server 2012 R2 is going EOL this year. The young administrator asked what he should do and well no one really had a good answer. So the young admin must have taken a shot of whiskey and said fuck it because before we knew it he had upgraded the server to 2022! And the old application is still up and running as if nothing changed! 
 The young administrator has earned himself all sorts of street cred with this, honestly, ballsy (maybe reckless) move! Us senior admins and engineers all want to fast track him with more responsibility! 
 I told that story because I don’t see that kind of risk taking by junior admins and honestly I kind of loved it!

                              <span>Hello all, 
 So I have a scenario that I’d like some advice on. I have an HP enterprise blade server with a single NIC in it that has two ports. It’s runner Windows Server 2019 with a Hyper V instance that I’d like to Run Untangle on. Now the question is, can I use one port on the NIC as Hyper V’s WAN and the second as a LAN for the internal network that would then be handled by Untangle, or should I just create a scope within Win Server to issue IP’s Via DHCP on the NIC’s second port, or is any of this even possible because I have never attempted it myself. I understand it’s an odd request and it’s more for a Proof of Concept rather than production, but I’m trying to prove a point to a manager that took one network class and now believes themselves and expert. 
 I’m in essence trying to create a network on this blade while getting a DHCP assigned address from the actual production network at work. Running that traffic through untangle to a layer 3 switch/router then out to two Layer 2 switches that will then assign addresses to plugged in devices. It’s a mess admittedly but again this is a proof of concept. 
 I thank anyone who has advice or comments in advance.

                              <span>According to what I know, lower metrics are preferred, but in this case, we have two vEdges routers (MPLS and Internet routers) that are both advertising default routing by using the command &quot;default-info originate,&quot; in OSPF.
 The current problem is that the client claims that there are subnet traversing to MPLS routers, which are meant to traverse through the Internet to reach public servers. Upon checking the configuration. The MPLS metric is set to 50 and the Internet to 1, respectively. Internet should be preferred based on the metric they have. Another thing, there is only one point-to-point connection between each router and the core switch, I am unable to access or control those core switches. (refer to the diagram w/ issue)
 https://ibb.co/hRsGv29
 I&#x27;ve now tried setting the MPLS value to 1 and the Inet value to 50, and apparently they claim it works. Do you believe that this is possible, particularly in multi-homed connections? (refer to the diagram FIXED)
 Thank you

                              <span>We&#x27;re starting the process of transitioning from 5508 WLCs to 9800-L-F WLCs. Our existing 5508s have around 100 APs (all 2700 and 2800 series) connected. I have the new WLCs set up in the same vlan and the plan is to eventually join the two WLC pairs in a mobility group to ease the transfer and eventually install all new 9115 APs but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m asking about today.
 I have the 9800s configured and I have one spare 2702 AP that I&#x27;m trying to get connected to it.
 5508 IP is: 10.1.50.135 (/25)
 9800 IP is: 10.1.50.132 (/25)
 I set up an isolated DHCP server with option 43 set to the IP of the 9800s and made sure the test AP would reach out to this DHCP server for an address. This part is working. The problem is even after a full wipe (format flash:) and reload from scratch, and after seeing a console message that it properly receives the .132 address from the DHCP server, it then reaches out to .135 anyway and I have no idea why.
 Here&#x27;s some selected console output to show what I mean:
 %DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface BVI1 assigned DHCP address 10.1.50.232, mask 255.255.255.128, hostname AP0081.c4fc.d39c %CAPWAP-5-DHCP_OPTION_43: Controller address 10.1.50.132 obtained through DHCP AP has SHA2 MIC certificate - Using SHA2 MIC certificate for DTLS. %CAPWAP-5-DTLSREQSEND: DTLS connection request sent peer_ip: 10.1.50.135 peer_port: 5246 
 This is after a full wipe and reload so I don&#x27;t think there can be any leftover config pointing the AP to .135

                              <span>Hey guys,
 has anyone had experience with Fortigate&#x27;s SSL-VPN in conjunction with a free token alternative? 
 Unfortunately, since it involves a high number of users, the FortiToken is not economical.
 Since I couldn&#x27;t find any other experiences after weeks of research, I&#x27;m still stuck with the following constellation: 
 (free)radius server (with Google Authenticator PAM module) as well as (open)LDAP server, which performs an AD user query.
 Active Directory is not mandatory.
 Greetings!

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m creating the floor plan for a new building in ExtremeCloud IQ. There is a giant refrigerated section of the building that uses metal-coated foam insulated wall panels like this:
 https://www.kingspan.com/us/en/products/controlled-environments/cold-storage-panel-systems/ks-shadowline-interior/
 Does anyone know approximately how many dB loss those typically cause? I only ask because when drawing walls in their tool, they only have selections for concrete (12dB), drywall (3dB), brick, and just common stuff. I just want to know what type of wall would be the best substitute.
 Thanks!

I created VLAN 110 on the core switch at our main site assined to a trunk port interface. The VLAN routes from the core firewall to our 2nd location&#x27;s MPLS router which then reaches the firewall. That&#x27;s where traffic stops. On the switch at the 2nd location I have added the vlan with an ip helper address to point back to our dhcp server at the main site. Everything in the firewall seems to be correct, but for some reason the route isn&#x27;t passing through. Can anyone give me an example of a switch config that might be missing or would be necessary to allow VLAN 110 to pass through?

 Call center voip every hosted in cloud and customer is reaching cloud using mpls. Sometimes the calls are not clear or have mumbling scratchy like there is some packet loss. 
 I want to know what should be trouble shooting approach here on all the devices in the path how to know where the issue is. Is it on customer onprem where agents are sitting or in mpls by the service provider or is it in network of cloud provider or is it the server in the cloud itself? I&#x27;m blank right now where to begin and what tools to use as a network engineer who isn&#x27;t a voice engineer? I just have to look from the network perspective if the problem is on the network level or not. 
 Please help.

                              <span>Hey all! 
 My team and I are working on a upcoming large/arena scale sized VR experience and some people would like to know what the best or most suggested routers for this setup would be:
  
60&#x27;x80&#x27; total coverage needed
 6 Meta Quest Pros, all using Wifi/Airlink
 6 individual desktops to power each individual headset
  
The headsets need to be able to talk/communicate to each other but do not need internet access, this is a local multiplayer experience. Wifi signal/coverage is extremely important too for quality to remain at the desired level. These are the general questions suggestions we are hoping someone could shed some light on:
  
What routers do we need to buy?
 And how are we doing the connections for each PC to each headset?
 Won’t each PC to headset connection require multiple routers?
 With each PC to VR headset on a separate connection and router?
 And then these routers cannot cover the whole space, so don’t we need a mesh network or wired connections to each of the routers in the ceiling?
  
Any help or recommendations on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Can we log user command activity on Cisco prime or ise?
 I know that we can do it on ise but how long can ise store those logs for? Can it do it for 1 year more than 1 year etc?
 What about prime and which one is the better option for storing logs.
 And when I talk about logs I&#x27;m talking about all commands which a user types into the cli on a switch/router etc.
 We are trying to figure out when some vlans were created on our core as these have no description and no svi associated with them. No Mac addresses associated with them either so thinking on whether to delete them or not but need to know who and when they were created and why.
 We use both prime and ise.
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a hard time finding documentation on how to do this. 
 I&#x27;ll have 10 Mesh APs(MAPs) out in a parking lot and I want to make sure a failure on the Root(RAP) doesn&#x27;t take down the whole mesh.
 I would want to have two RAPs both wired back to a switch.
 How do I accomplish this without taking down the network with a loop? 
 I&#x27;ve seen documentation on ethernet daisy-chaining but I don&#x27;t think that fits this use case. 
 I&#x27;ve other posts that hint that you don&#x27;t need to worry about spanning-tree as each MAP will only use one path back to wired network anyway.

The whole billing to CC is getting out of hand and I&#x27;d like to set them up to be paid like any other vendor(whatever the accounts receivable people do). I have done some digging and it seems like the Starlink communities are full of people who don&#x27;t get why you would not want to be billed via CC for several hundred different connections in a company.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to figure out if there is a way to open a port for a host on the other side of a Policy based IPSec tunnel. The reason I want to do this is because most of my sites sit behind a CGNAT and I&#x27;m not able to open up ports on those sites firewall. Well if I do it would be pretty useless haha
 The current network setup involves OPNSense in Azure as a hub and the sites connect to is so the can reach each other. They also use OPNSense as their firewall as well. 
 My subnets for each network are the following
 Azure: 10.0.0.0/24
 Site A: 10.1.0.0/24
 Site B: 10.2.0.0/24
 Site C: 10.3.0.0/24
 So basically what I&#x27;m trying to figure out is if I have a host on Site A is is possible to open a port on the Azure side of the tunnel and forward the traffic to back to the host on Site A?

                              <span>I have a company laptop that refuses to complete the connection to an updated Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. I&#x27;ve tried all the troubleshooting steps I can, and the adapter works flawlessly with the same hardware but a blank computer so I&#x27;m thinking it must be something about the GP/setup on the domain computers that&#x27;s preventing it from completing the connection.
 When you press win+k it&#x27;ll happily find any miracast screen, but it&#x27;ll try to connect and then fail after about 20 seconds. I tried the troubleshooting steps below but everything seems fine. DXDIAG has it as supported, firewall is setup to allow wireless displays so I&#x27;m at a loss. I had a poke with Event Viewer but I&#x27;m either not looking in the right place or there&#x27;s nothing there that indicates an issue.
 I am not the IT team, they&#x27;re not supporting this and don&#x27;t really know what miracast is and fed back that &#x27;we don&#x27;t support 3rd party apps&#x27; - this is not a 3rd part app so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s been inadvertently blocked due to something else.
 Oddly, it used to work about 3 years ago, then coming back off lockdown it now does not.
 Steps I followed below:

                              <span>Hi all,
 Long time lurker on the sub and just had a few questions. Bit of background of myself, currently a helpdesk guy looking to learn networking to move into a network admin role one day. The other day my boss showed me one of our comms room with a rack of live networking equipment. The rack consisted of multiple Aruba switches/controllers and Cisco router stacked on top of each other.
 My question is how would you go about moving all this equipment to another building? Would it simply be a process of unracking all the equipment and cables --&gt; move equipment to another building --&gt; rerack all the equipment and plug in all the cables?
 Another question is how do you guys keep track of which cables are plugged into which device? I&#x27;ve seen network diagrams before but are there diagrams for which cable goes where?
 My guess would be you would need to save the running configurations on all these devices and take pictures of all the cabling.
 Is there anything else you guys would consider?

                              <span>Hi r/networking!
 This seems to be the place to ask about EVE-NG. I&#x27;m a relatively inexperienced network engineer at a company with a corporate EVE-NG Pro server. Each employee has a username to access it.
 We can see and access each other&#x27;s labs, but when I try to access a device I get presented with a generic bash prompt. Like it&#x27;s allowing me to access the emulator without the device image being present. 
 Is there a way for two users to simultaneously work on a lab together? If so, how do we go about it?

                              <span>So, some background, my company&#x27;s security cameras are connected to a Windows 2016 server. It&#x27;s a new system, and the video quality is extremely choppy and bad. I reached out to the security company&#x27;s helpdesk and they suggested nic teaming 2 of the nics to increase bandwidth. So I added nic 1 and nic 2 to a team along with the settings the help desk suggested. As it&#x27;s adding the nics, it immediately errors out and states Faulted, not found on both nics, then the redundant nics 3 and 4 drop their connections. When I realized that the security camera server had no network, I immediately called a senior analyst over, and then the server became unresponsive. Since it was unresponsive, we rebooted it. It stayed on the &quot;restarting&quot; screen for apx 5 minutes and then blue-screened. Also, before it became unresponsive, I attempted a windows troubleshoot, and it gave me a &quot;drivers&quot; error. What could have caused the server to freak out.

 EDIT: I decided to blur out the company name. If people are concerned and want to know the name, then please message me. If a moderator allows the use of their name in this post, then I might add it back in.
 I&#x27;m posting this here because I find it hilarious. I&#x27;ve brought up the issue in 2 separate phone calls to the company, and 3 separate tickets on their online site. This all started toward the end of the summer of 2021.

                              <span>I just spent 2 hours looking through the internet for the user manual for this KVM&#x27;s manual to find the default username and password. Tons of results for the IP enabled version, as well as some other unit with a K in the model number, but NONE for this EXACT model. Those units have a different default username and password.
 So, I&#x27;m putting this on the internet for posterity. Hopefully Google scrapes this page and no one else is stuck in the same spot as I was. 
 B020-U08-19 Default username &#x3D; BLANK B020-U08-19 Default password &#x3D; BLANK
 RESET THE PASSWORD BY TAKING THE COVER OFF THE KVM AND JUMPING THE PINS LABELLED RESTORE DEFAULT PASSWORD, AS SEEN IN OTHER MANUALS AND VIDEOS. 
 Hope this helps!

 They need to be able to find out the server name and IP to be able to connect to their database with this third party app.
 I’m like, here is the server name and IP and let me know if they have any issues….
 Chirp chirp….
 Poor students.

Everything from flickering monitors to the inability to wake up monitors to display ports just stops working. And yes I&#x27;ve tried everything....literally everything. I&#x27;m ready to move on. 
 What have you all had success with?
 I&#x27;ve tested the Plugable brand docks and have had no issues so far (almost a year in service) so I&#x27;m leaning toward that brand. 
 Thanks!

 Is it took much work to highlight the text and copy and paste it, so I can do the same instead of having to type it in by hand from your screenshot into whatever tool I am using to try fix your problem?

                              <span>Trying again as I lost the post I just typed. 
 Why do leavers from a non tech background of the role they work in, think it&#x27;s acceptable in 2023 after they have decided to part ways with the company to demand a leaving &quot;rider&quot;, after they handed the notice in?
 head of business and approvers above this allow it when they know it&#x27;s more work to make a corp device into a personal one. Doing all of the admin alongside to make sure there is no data leak. 
 Then the business describes this year the same old thing we have no budget to invest in new systems, hardware, infrastructure or give bonuses due to the economic world. 
 We work incredibly hard all of us to keep the business running in a stable robust environment to prevent from breaches and other unknowns. I can say that and other IT admins will hopefully respect that. 
 Yet it just feels when you see a leaver asking you about the process of keeping my IT business assets when I leave it&#x27;s like do we owe you that. It&#x27;s not yours. It&#x27;s the businesses. Yes you have a phone number that&#x27;s the businesses line number. Your iPhone the one that says property of XYZ.com is again a business asset. Also the laptop which is a corp laptop with a corp image on it with corp licensing on it is not yours they still seem to think it&#x27;s ok to ask for this when they leave like it&#x27;s a sentimental thing ? 
 Then it comes your manager asks you to make sure they transition you off everything and give them the guidance you should of done this and that. In work hours when you have other actual jobs work related jobs to be doing. 
 Why do businesses not stand up and have a stern stance on this. They have a HR team they have policies and procedures and we chase users for not bringing kit back and holding final salary payment but the odd who dosent want to let go demands they want IT hardware as a parting gift. Opinions?

Our servers hiccuped lightly middle of last week, then died completely Friday morning. They have been down ever since then, they were able to partially restore all of the drives that aren&#x27;t needed for the day-to-day work yesterday but the drives we need are still MIA. 
 I&#x27;d estimate the files take up maybe 10TB of space, nightly backups exist.....they are just having one hell of a time restoring them apparently.
 This is a company that does over 100m of revenue a year.

                              <span>I had an interesting discussion with a co-worker today and told him how I was using ChatGPT to help me write/improve some powershell code. He said he would feel a little weird using it for work...like it&#x27;s not his work. I said, &quot;no...just another tool in the arsenal. How long have you been using StackOverflow or google to copy code?&quot; You have to know code to tell it what to do so it&#x27;s not like some dude off the street can explain how to create a complex function in powershell. 
 Anyway, how many other sysadmins have been actively using ChatGPT? What have you primarily used it for at work? And do any of your coworkers know? I&#x27;m a bit reluctant to even mention it to anyone else after that conversation.

                              <span>We have one specific system (laptop) where a user is somehow being added to the Administrators group. 
 We thought the user got the Administrator account password and was adding themselves to the Administrators group. That might not be the case here. 
 The user really isn’t computer savvy. They also haven’t made any changes ever to the system while having Administrator privileges. 
 We did change the Administrator password on that system a few weeks ago. We haven’t touched the system since. It seemed like maybe it was indeed the user making the group change somehow because it stopped for a while. Today, their account popped back into the Administrators group. There is no record of the Administrator account being logged into or used in order to make the group change. They are just magically in the Administrators group again. 
 We originally thought it was something related to the original sysprep of the system because they would get added to the Administrators group at almost every login. That doesn’t seem to be case here since it stopped for a while. We’re thinking it might be some system service or an application they launch that is adding them to the group?
 Any ideas on how to trace this? We’re already using Event Viewer to track the group change being made and confirmed in the GUI that they are indeed in the Administrators group.
 Any other ideas how this is occurring?

                              <span>/rant Based on a true story:
 I was asked to create a NAT and firewall rule set from an external IP to a 3rd party controlled server dead smack in the middle of an important internal subnet.
 I have zero reason to believe anyone has set up comprehensive local device firewalls on the other devices in this subnet.
 I pitched the idea that they either review their individual firewalls, or create a DMZ for their new server, and only allow inside access to the items the 3rd party box &#x27;needs&#x27;.
 NOPE! We&#x27;re going to blast a goddamned hole in the perimeter with no further thought given. I have the proof in email that this is the choice that was made.
 Not only would I like to tell them to make these awful configs themselves, I&#x27;d like to tell them I won&#x27;t help them when they get owned, and they should request someone else.
 What is the point in doing a job badly, and dutifully taking part in bad practices? I can get paid to do shit work in a thousand other places where nobody is experienced or conscientious enough to notice or care. I tried for something better, and now am subject to bad choices by unqualified high ranking functionaries.
 The second something goes wrong, I&#x27;m checking into the E.R. with a fatal case of &#x27;I Told You So&#x27;, and they can find another technician to bail them out.
 Nuts to these clipboard cowboys.

                              <span>Ok I&#x27;ve been in IT for 20+yrs now. Maybe Microsoft did make this change I didn&#x27;t know but I can&#x27;t seem to locate any documentation reflecting this information that my superior told someone. Did Microsoft change this &quot;behaviour&quot; recently for windows 10/11?
 &quot;This is a ridiculously dumb Microsoft change.
 Shutting down your PC doesn&#x27;t restart your computer. (not intuitive and a behaviour change recently)
 Restart, is the only way to reset and start fresh.
 In effect if you shutdown and turn on your PC every day of the year. It is effectively the same thing as having never restarted your PC for a year. At the end of the day you should hit the &#x27;Restart&#x27; button instead of shutting it down.&quot;

 Putting aside the pieces on it blocking ads as a revenue source for things like Youtube, is there any security risk in using them? Or it all a benefit from helping to block the rise in malwaretising?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll share as much detail as possible as this problem hasn&#x27;t waivered. Keep in mind this is my first step up from IT specialist to sys admin so bear with me OGs.
 We are operating on a 2016 Windows Server and this holds all of our drives. The business is about 100 people. In November, I installed the .NET Framework 4.8(KB5020614) and the Update for Windows Server 2016(KB5019964). I have had non-stop issues with connectivity to the drives ever since. The errors string from &quot;local device name is already in use,&quot; to &quot;Target name is incorrect.&quot;
 I have found limited success in doing ipconfig/release-renew-flushdns. It&#x27;s usually a 50-50 chance that the issue resolves after that. If I use the IP address to the server in the file explorer address bar, it immediately pulls up; its the complete opposite when I try to call it by its name \\server1\. I&#x27;ve checked the DNS and DHCP to see if they&#x27;re properly communicating and there seems to be nothing wrong(not ruling them out).
 As recent as yesterday, I have started to force our user computers to use a different IP through the IPv4 in adapter options. For instance, I&#x27;ll make 192.168.8.113 go to 192.168.8.204. I have found complete success with this and the most odd part is I can set the user machine back to automatically grabbing an IP address which will revert it to 192.168.8.113 and it instantly works. 
 It seems like I&#x27;m forcing the previous session to end and renewing the lease on the DHCP ??? I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m open to all suggestions as my boss(the owner) grows in irritation. 
 Thanks ahead of time.

                              <span>Hi all, Company pretty lax in terms of its approach to BYOD.
 Something that i want to fix. I need to determine which users are utilising BYOD and how they are doing it to work out a plan of action.
 We use O365 and have DUO+Okta.
 Ideally, i would like a report of some description that shows logins from non-corporate devices.
 DUO reports do not give me the hostname of the device the user is logging in from, and i dont believe Azure logins do either. 
 In an ideal world i would just turn on the posture settings of DUO and see who screams, but that isnt going to go down well.
 I need to demonstrate the scale of this to upper management so they realise how many people do this and realise the exposure we have with data on personal devices etc etc. 
 Can anyone think of a good way to determine which devices logins to O365/DUO/Okta are coming from?
 Was thinking whether the install log from O365 apps gives telemetry of the device its installed on?

                              <span>Hello! I have a question regarding following topic/usecase. 
 We have here a classic on-prem Environement with a hyper-V cluster and mainly Windows Servers in Production. Now we have a new system that will run &quot;dockerized&quot;, that environement is a composition of 7-8 containers that run together to deliver that service (mysql, redis, nginx and some other images).
 How do you deal with that &quot;in general&quot; regarding the management of such stuff?
 Do you create a bunch of linux hosts virtualised inside hyper-V and manage them with some container orchestrator (any tips - can be commercially backed and cost something)? So, something like a virtualized cluster?
 Do you build something completely &quot;aside&quot; like a bunch of synlogy nas with docker support? or even a complete new hardware cluster?
 Using windows servers for docker stuff does not make sense imho. 
 Thanks for any recommendation :)

                              <span>Hello,
 I support about 200 users in one company but need to support about 100 in other companies. I had been using real VNC but the customers hate it because I&#x27;m not on their computers so they have to invite me and right click is a challenge.
 I tried out meshcentral and it looks great but the developer may stop working on it.
 I need something very easy to use like teamviewer but probably more affordable and they seeem like the used car salesman of remote support.
 I definitely need multi monitor support.
 Quick assist is free but doesn&#x27;t let you see when the pop up for admin comes up to install something and my users don&#x27;t have local admin rights.
 Thanks.

 Logging in the Browser works fine. Just PowerShell is stuck. Tried it on several machines, all the same.

 Anyone experiencing the same or knows how to fix this? I tried in PowerShell7 and it works, but we don&#x27;t have PowerShell 7 installed everywhere.

                              <span>Ok so while typing what was going to be the original post this has started working, but for no apparent reason. This has now gone from a request for help to a quest of understanding.
 So a while ago I was doing some fiddling with a client Synology, had created a new backup folder, unmapped the old one, attempted to remap the new one. &quot;Invalid Password&quot;. Ok sure, that happens sometimes, thing is I didn&#x27;t actually need the drive to be mapped as the backup software (backup assist) could see the location and access it with the given details so I figured it&#x27;d be fine. Decided to fix mapping the drive after the next scheduled reboot.
 Everything was not fine, turns out that despite being able to see and access the NAS, when attempting to actually perform the backup task it would fail as &quot;unable to access the network location&quot;. Keep in mind, all I have done is make a new 2023 subfolder in the backup folder (we&#x27;re MSP, they like it that way) and try to map it back after removing the 2022 folder.
 So I make a new user, try to map it with that, nope, same thing. Despite being able to log into the device with these same creds that Windows doesn&#x27;t like.
 After that I restart things, bash my head against the wall a bit, find some other people who had similar problems that came about as the result of a setting change (none of mine have, double and triple checked), so I come here, begin writing my post, and mid way through I decide to try to map it one more time.
 It fucking works.
 And I haven&#x27;t even done anything. I didn&#x27;t even have to type the details in, it just immediately worked and mapped it like there&#x27;d never even been a problem.

 Our app is built in javascript and we use hubspot as CRM. We are losing tracking data on users signing up with SSO. In CRM, all those users show up as &quot;User created through offline sources or integration&quot;. Product/Tech team is way too busy to figure it out for me. Anyone has any experience with this? I would love to get you guys more answers if you think this post needs a little more details. Please help as I have been researching a lot with deadends. Thank you so much!

 If you have an NVR seggerated into it&#x27;s own VLAN and is port forwarded, would you just simply assign it a public DNS like google or still use internal (with ACL restricting that VLAN to only communicate with DNS server on tcp/udp 53)?

                              <span>With the data breach that happened for LastPass, I see many people (rightfully) being critical of LastPass but also recommending other similar services like BitWarden?
 I can see using KeePass on a local device for obvious reasons can be more secure, if you know how to keep the KeePass files away from others, but why do people consider BitWarden to be a safer alternative to LastPass? Is it just that LastPass has been breached and BitWarden not (at least to our knowledge) or is BitWarden doing something different that puts them ahead of LastPass?

 I want to know what are some of the account recovery processes you have found are good in the case that someone looses MFA app/phone/recovery codes.
 I’ve found some great flows but wanted to see what I haven’t thought of.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using the Windows Server Essential Client backup for a few years now, but I&#x27;m looking to upgrade from Server 2016 to Server 2022 and client backup is removed.
 What are some good backup solutions? 
 I like the ability to PXE boot to restore my clients.
 I&#x27;m currently testing Macrium and Veeam.

                              <span>hello :)
 we have a big problem at our RDS System and our Print Server.
 I need more time to analyze it but i dont want the users to always call it so we can restart the print spooler.
 So here is my plan:
 i activated the log funtion in &quot; Get-WinEvent Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational &quot;. If the problem occours we can see it in the Event-ID 821 (which gets created everytime a print happens on the client that tells you the status. if its status 0x0 everything worked, if its not 0x0 there was a problem. In our case we always get the status code 0x6BA: example: https://imgur.com/a/kAOQJf3
 So i want an workaround for our endusers that automaticly checks if there is something different than Status: 0x0 in the 821 Event.
 The Question is how to do it right? I can create an trigger in the taskscheduluer for event 821 but keep in mind that in event 821 the successfully and failure prints are listed. Is there a way with custom XML-Filtering? 
 Can someone give me a tipp or example for the right direction?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all - about to be running a migration to get us the hell off of box and onto sharepoint instead.
 ​
 Opinions of sharepoint aside, one of the biggest problems I have right now is shit data in / shit data out. Does anyone know of a good, reliable way to deduplicate data either in Box or in sharepoint?
 This box environment is an unholy mess and despite asking repeatedly the various leads have somehow not gotten around to cleansing their own data - meaning there are duplicated folders all over the damn place.

                              <span>Hi,
 A have about 90 static websites that will be deployed over 2 webservers at 2 public cloud providers. I want to put a load balancer in front of them to auto failover. But I don&#x27;t want to bother setting up and managing a HAproxy or KEMP. I&#x27;m now looking at cloudflare, which costs 5 euro a month per site. Are there any alternatives I could be looking at? 
 Thanks

                              <span>We have a wildcard DNS entry for a couple of our domains. On one of them we are seeing an massive amount of traffic toward non-existing subdomains. We had this the first time in the beginning of February with about 2,5 million request over 4 days. Annoying but not something our webserver could not handle. Did an abuse report to Azure as it was an IP address in their space. 
 Yesterday at 1am a new scan started, again from a Azure IP address. Did a new abuse report but after 750000 request I had enough and blocked the IP address around 2pm, to my surprise the second I blocked te IP address the pattern moved from 1 IP address to random IP addresses from all over the world. At this moment I have more than 19000 IP addresses. The rate of requests has slowed down but still we see around 15000 requests an hour. 
 Anybody experienced this?
 My idea is removing the wildcard entry and just add the necessary subdomains to our DNS (would be around 70-100), my co-worker however things it is useless.

 Just thinking each time you exclude a user or make a change to the MFA policy it wants to exclude the admin account. This could easily catch someone out and they accidentally exclude an admin so it has no MFA
 Also yes I&#x27;ve got a break glass account with multiple 2FA methods. Don&#x27;t like having an account without MFA

                              <span>Morning all,
 Work for a CSP and we have an Excel sheet that we copy + paste each month to record backups for customers, each backup type (i.e. offsite or onsite) and what we back up (physical server, VM&#x27;s). To record success/failure - each cell has a tick box. We get emails to a specific shared mailbox for the backups, so the process of recording the backups is to check the folder for a given client, tick if the expected backup succeeded, go on to the next (and of course if there isn&#x27;t a tick, investigate why).
 Problem being that it&#x27;s pretty slow to load several thousand tickboxes and as soon as we create a new backup/new customer it completely drags it down. We create a new document every month. It&#x27;s been this way for a few years but given the recording of backups takes 30 minutes a day and feels like a early 2000&#x27;s solution - feeling there&#x27;s got to be a better way.
 What&#x27;re you doing to record your backups?

                              <span>Our company has gone fully remote over the last few years and might be looking at terminating a remote employee. We are a fairly small company and to be honest, haven&#x27;t had to fire any once since we have been full remote. I still need to work out the details with HR, but I got the impression this will be over a teams call. Our business works with a lot of customer data that this individual has access to, and want to cut that access almost instantly after the call. Here is a bit about our environment:
 User has a laptop that is Intune enrolled. We have our DCs in Azure and use a lot of the typical MS services such as teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.. This particular user has some of our customer files SharePoint doc libraries synced with OneDrive to his local machine.
 If while we are on the call, his password is changed, SharePoint and files access removed, doesnt this take some time to sync? I believe the last time I removed some ones Azure files access, they had it for several more hours. Is this the same for Sharepoint? We do have &quot;Automate&quot; installed on his machine, so I could force a reboot, but if he is not on the VPN at the time, the password might not sync and still be cached. I did some research and saw there is a registry item that can be changed.
 Although I could wipe the machine with Intune, I do want to be able to go through the machine and make sure he does not have local files that need moved to a project directory on the network. 
 Will a password change instantly cut his access on his phone as well, or do I need to revoke those tokens as well?
 I would appreciate any suggestions to make this as streamlined as possible, its not something we are particularly excited about having to do, but they are leaving us no choice.

                              <span>Wondering if anyone has an answer to an issue I have with the Number Matching process on MS Authenticator.
 I have browsers setup to open two tabs for two separate systems when a user launches a browser.
 When a user opens a browser and number match is enabled, the user gets two different two digit codes for entering into their authenticator app. One for each tab.
 Is it possible to have a single code for the two tabs that are launching simultaneously or is this just the way it works?

                              <span>Hi,
 I need a way to analyse if OS packages (OEL/RHEL/Ubuntu/Debian) are vulnerable to a CVE&#x27;s. Most vendors have an oval file that describes &quot;package with version lower than XXX is vunrable&quot;.
 I have an ansible playbook that gathers all the packages and writes them to a server (a file per host)
 I know there are a lot of tools and ways to see if a system in vulnerable to an CVE (oscap/vuls...). But nothing that is actually without installation of the tool on the server itself.
 So I was wondering if there are tools/scripts that just have a parser of OVAL with an input &quot;a package or a package list&quot;
 something like
 cvereport.py -i server_packages.list -o oval file.
 I know oscap-ssh exist and that might be a solution. Vuls also looks like it is agentless but I want to avoid having &quot;another inventory to maintain&quot; (ansible and vuls)

 I have to point our Public DNS A record to CNAME. I have the following plan and just wanted to check if this looks ok or any input. 
  
Change the TTL to 10 minutes for A record.
 Delete the A record.
 Wait for 20 minutes before the cache will be cleared and check from different computers to be sure that A record is dead.
 Create CNAME for this deleted record.
  
If anyone has some suggestion then do let me know.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m a senior sysadmin and devops engineer and had been the sole IT guy at a startup.
 When the startup began ramping up production, we added another sysadmin to our team whose resume looked great, who interviewed well, and came with good references. We discovered pretty quickly, however, that he had only worked in Tier 1 and in many ways was even greener than someone straight out of school.
 In his first week, he broke our PowerAutomate workflows by messing around with our Azure Automation Account... as in he deleted it and attempted to recreate it but denied having touched it. Nothing else explains how the client ID changed, nor why the API permissions were incorrect and the callback URI&#x27;s were missing. This ended up being extra work on my plate getting everything running again.

                              <span>So this may be a stupid question and maybe I&#x27;m reading too much into it, but here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m unsure:
 I deal with Cybersecurity Insurance Questionnaires for our clients. A lot of times it&#x27;ll ask if server databases are encrypted at-rest, and from my understanding and from what tools we use, this is basically asking &quot;Is Bitlocker enabled on server data disks?&quot; and the answer is typically No.
 However now I have this question for a client who&#x27;s servers are all Azure VMs. These do not have Azure Disk Encryption enabled, which from my (potentially limited) understanding, means Bitlocker is not enabled on the virtual disk. However, Azure VMs by default live on Microsoft&#x27;s data centers, and the physical disks in those data centers have server-side encryption (SSE) 
 So my question is... does this count for at-rest encryption as far as this cybersecurity questionnaire is concerned? Because from my (again, probably limited) understanding, at-rest encryption is intended to protect against someone getting access to the physical disk, and sure this would prevent it if someone broke into the Microsoft data center and somehow stole the disk this VM lived on so that would seem to make the answer to the question &quot;Yes&quot; in the most technical sense. But if someone gained access to the Azure environment &amp; stole the VHD file, then Bitlocker isn&#x27;t enabled on that file and could presumably read all the contents then it&#x27;s like... was at-rest encryption really even on? Is at-rest encryption explicitly a protection against physical data breaches? Or should at-rest encryption include VM disk encryption when the server in question is a VM?
 Or maybe I&#x27;m thinking too hard about this?

                              <span>Hi,
 We just started to receive a few calls from users informing us, that some Microsoft Apps on iOS seem to be stuck on updating.
 Looks like they are being offloaded by iOS, guessing by settings &gt; general &gt; iphone storage, but to my suprise, the offloading setting isn&#x27;t even accessible/visible under settings &gt; app store &gt; app offloading.
 Unfortunately, those devices are DEP and MDM enabled AND the Company Portal App (Intune) is also offloaded, so those other apps are never gonna get updated due to &quot;broken&quot; devices. 
 Best workaround is to fully reinstall the device, which is cumbersome.
 ​
 Does anyone have a clue on how to prevent or undo this? I couldn&#x27;t find an MDM switch for this Intune or on the web.

                              <span>We managed a bunch of RDS Collections for several customers, we deploy the RDP file that is generated as part of this that you can download from RDWeb after the collection is setup, this is the file that&#x27;s digitally signed as part of the setup - generally this just &quot;works&quot;.
 All of a sudden yesterday morning we got a report of an error on a customer when trying to connect into their collection, the error appears when double clicking the RDP file:
 &quot;The digital signature of this RDP File cannot be verified. The remote connection cannot be started.&quot;
 Interestingly, some users still worked fine however, and these were users sat next to each other in the same office.
 Now, we&#x27;ve seen issues where the signature can throw off the RDP file sometimes so we edited the file in notepad and removed both the &quot;signscope:s:&quot; and &quot;signature:s:&quot; values, this allowed it to work, obviously this bypasses the whole &quot;digitally signed&quot; part of the file.
 We checked the usual before this, ensuring all the certificates were valid etc. (they were) and no weird updates had been applied to clients or the relevant servers (they hadn&#x27;t) so we deployed this file to affected users.
 However, we then got a report from another customer with the same issue, then a third reported the issue. Our initial thought being some sort of CA issue, but two of these customers used Sectigo, the other was R5/GlobalSign so that ruled that idea out.
 We couldn&#x27;t find a reason for this so eventually just had to remove those two lines from the files and it seemed to resolve the issue. A cursory glance around the Internet only really flagged this issue when using self signed certs, we aren&#x27;t.
 Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! At the moment we have only seen this at 3 (maybe 4) customers but obviously don&#x27;t want to see this get more widespread!
 As an additional point, the RDP file &quot;breaks&quot; regardless of where it&#x27;s used from, so it doesn&#x27;t look to be the originating network that&#x27;s the issue.

                              <span>It is true that in order to do that, the solution is laid out in the open as : Buy Power BI embed license, register an app in your Azure AD and generate a token in order to embed the report URL inside an iframe without authentication prompting out. But, is it possible to do that without going through the cloud based solutions and architectures, by just having an on prem Power BI Report Server and doing all the work through developing a solution that makes the embedding of the needed URL for a given Power BI report without having to authenticate, just by passing a token through the url ? Thank you.

                              <span>Hi have set up a RDS environment and it works fine. But when connecting from outside the domain, RDP seems to respond slow, a 20 second timeout and then proceeds to connect. But when inside the domain, it works fast. According to my wireshark capture, RD gateway tries to do LDAP to clients DC and not it own. Anyone have any tips?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have some question to ask here. Is it the size of recycle bin in the server too big, can effect the performance of that server or take space from it? I have client that never clean their data in recycle bin and now the deleted data in recycle bin almost 200++ GB and now they have difficulties to clean from recycle bin as it spike the memory up to 100% when do the deletion. Please advise.

 Type a command on a wrong keyboard

 I’m coming from a C8540 where this was an AireOS option in AP groups and I feel like this should be configureable within an RLAN profile on the 9800.
 Trouble is, only way I’ve found to enable the LAN ports is in the per access point configuration. Got 1000 of these to deploy and there must be default or global way to do this. Anyone come across anything that I’m missing?

                              <span>Hi all
 Trying to get into deeper networking and I&#x27;ve been wanting to get into monitoring/analysis on my network so I&#x27;m looking to get some recommendations for this
 I have a couple of scenarios in which I&#x27;m trying to monitor/log certain packets being sent from a machine to the internet. 
  I have two PCs sending some data to a specific destination that I want to monitor on and store for analysis at a later date. Data is not encrypted on the wire.
 I have four PCs that sends some data out to the internet that I want to run through a self built TCP proxy to simulate some network conditions without running the proxy on any client.
 I was wondering if any of this is possible straight out of the switch itself via some configuration/port mirroring or if it&#x27;s possible to build a proxy machine with 2 quad NICs where I could basically bridge 2 ports for data to come in and out before it gets sent to a switch on the network where I could maybe run my proxy on the to monitor and maybe alter data being sent between the NICs.
 Don&#x27;t know if any of this is possible so any help would be gladly appreciated.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello Again, Reddit! I&#x27;ve come to ask for some help with a port forwarding issue I&#x27;ve got going on.
 My edge/gateway device is a Sonicwall TZ215 running SonicOS 6.X. I have an A record as sub.domain.tld on my public DNS that points to this device&#x27;s WAN interface IP. No issues there.
 My internal host is a Proxmox host running a few web servers. I have a port forwarding rule on the Sonicwall to reach the Proxmox web UI from the internet on HTTPS/TCP port 8006. I have an SSL certificate installed on the Proxmox host for sub.domain.tld. This works perfectly.
 I am now trying to add more web servers to this subdomain on other ports, i.e. https://sub.domain.tld:8443 and http://sub.domain.tld My issue is that I get an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in my browser for any other port.
 My NAT configuration for the other two web servers that I&#x27;m trying to reach matches the NAT configuration for the working web server, the Proxmox host on https://sub.domain.tld:8006, except I created a service object entry for HTTPS/8443. That&#x27;s the only difference. Still, I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.
 I did a packet monitoring in the Sonicwall appliance to try to isolate the issue and I see the traffic is being dropped to the internal hosts using 80 and 8443, due to &quot;Error code 40 (Enforced firewall rule)&quot;.
 There isn&#x27;t any kind of p@cket trac3r or traffic simulator like ASA has so I&#x27;m kind of at a loss. There really aren&#x27;t any other firewall policies set up since this is a really basic and new configuration, so I can&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;d be anything conflicting.
 The reachable web server and the non-reachable web servers are in the same network zone as defined by the Sonicwall, so it shouldn&#x27;t be an access issue either.
 I can reach the web servers both internally and on a separate network segment for VPN. 
 I&#x27;m stumped, any ideas? Thanks in advance for anyone&#x27;s input.

                              <span>So I was an SE at Verizon for a few years and one of the things that I did not realize before coming there was the distinction between an ILEC and CLEC. I realized that ILECs had certain legal obligations, but I didn&#x27;t realize how different they were organizationally.
 Verizon (when it came to networking services, at least) was essentially split into 3 different companies:
  
Verizon Business (Long-Haul Network Services + CLEC)
 Verizon Telecom (ILEC)
 Verizon Wireless
  
I never quite understand why it was that ILECs were treated like different legal entities, as nothing I read suggested it has to be that way... I&#x27;m not sure if all service providers do this, but I know for sure that AT&amp;T does. So for you old timers in telecom who understand a bit of the organizational/legal considerations surrounding networking, can you explain to me why it is that ILEC &amp; non-ILEC services are often split into different companies?

                              <span>just got off the phone with our AT&amp;T team. Trying to get a hold of what we get as service from them, POTS, Network connectivity, Fax lines (no one knows who is using them). As you can see accounting is a mess with AT&amp;T. 
 ​
 The team from AT&amp;T says it is extremely difficult for them to look into their own accounting system to find out what they are billing us 🤷‍♀️ We are also transitioning from a managed billing consolidation to internal ap team and need to setup AT&amp;T as a vendor. 
 ​
 I want to do the process right, but at the same time want to run away from AT&amp;T. 
 ​
 My internal team is telling me that AT&amp;T owns a lot of last mile circuits for many of our facilities. 
 ​
 Any thoughts on how to approach this ? 
 ​
 Essentially it&#x27;s a mess out there. Any help / guidance will be appreciated.

                              <span>Just thought I&#x27;d do a PSA for this in case anyone runs into this issue again. We had a request to make some NDI capable cameras work with OBS over our enterprise wireless (this particular SSID had to be created on our older Cisco 8510 due to the APs involved). The cameras themselves I believe are Mevo brand.
 After making some tweaks to get the cameras connected and accessible from the Mevo mobile app (client isolation was turned on in the WLAN config so easy fix), the next issue was that the devices were not being discovered as NDI camera sources in OBS. NDI uses mDNS but I was having issues finding the specific service string so we could add it to the mDNS snooping allow list. Ended up doing a packet capture to find it: 
 _ndi._tcp.local.
 Simple enough but even searching this in Google now that I know the answer didn&#x27;t bring in a lot of results so I wanted to post this and hopefully it is helpful to someone in the future.

                              <span>I have a building with 5 stacks of Cisco C9200L switches. Across all of those I have one VLAN which is our AV VLAN with about 180 devices of various types of AV equipment from Teams Rooms to Dante microphones/speakers, amplifiers, control systems and Crestron NVX encoders/decoders. Everything works perfectly fine. 
 I’m trying to add a new audio conferencing solution that needs to connect to some cameras using ONVIF for control. The main system sends out a discovery to the network to find any cameras. The cameras can also be manually added but then after populating the details it sends an ONVIF discovery probe to get all the details of the device. These processes don’t work at all on the AV network. If I change the addresses of these devices to any other subnet it works. 
 My assumption is that there’s too much traffic flying around on that network and the messages are getting blocked somehow. I’m at a loss as to how to rectify it though. All the stacks have 10gig uplinks with no saturation, igmp snooping configured, igmp querier set to collapsed core Nexus. Any ideas what I might be missing?
 Edit: I got it. It was an issue with MTU and jumbo frames.

 Sorry if this is a dumb question. we&#x27;re going to have pro services work on it and I just want to get more insight into the project. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Anybody out there have Silver Peaks deployed on their network? I’m curious if anyone else experiences extremely long Orchestration times? Ran into an issue where someone had the labels swapped on our MPLS interfaces, went in and deleted all the tunnels because they were still showing src and dst as two different MPLS carriers. But it takes over an hour to orchestrate the changes.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to find a good source of what actions are hardware accelerated in particular device. For example if I would like to know if BGP best path calculations are handled in hardware on isr4331 how could I know that? Because official cisco data sheet isn&#x27;t really useful: &quot; High-performance multicore processors support high-speed WAN connections. The data plane uses an emulated Flow Processor (FP) that delivers Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-like performance that does not degrade as services are added. &quot; They do mention about hardware acceleration for ipsec but nothing more than that.

                              <span>So I am trying to redistribute some specific static routes into my OSPF process, basically any static routes with a next hop of 10.27.4.1 should be redistributed.Can anyone advise a simple way to do this? At the minute I&#x27;ve created a prefix-list/route-map permitting the routes individually, but obviously this isn&#x27;t hugely scale-able going forward.
 I saw a blog post that mentioned doing this with the next-hop option in a prefix list:
 ip prefix-list STATIC-NEXT-HOP seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 match ip next-hop 10.27.4.1 
 but I can&#x27;t actually find this as a valid Cisco command anywhere, and even if it is it isn&#x27;t available on my C9000.
 Seems there must be a simple way to do this but I can&#x27;t figure it out right now!
 I also tried an access list with &quot;permit ip any host 10.27.4.1 &quot; and feeding this into a route-map but that didn&#x27;t play along either.

                              <span>Hello community, 
 Long time lurker here. For the past 2 years I set up my own company and I have been working as a B2B contractor as a network engineer. This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).
 Won&#x27;t get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it&#x27;s one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC&#x27;s for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They&#x27;ll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant. 
 The reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I&#x27;m single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I&#x27;m curious what is the status of remote work where you&#x27;re currently at ?
 This contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence. 
 Since the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ? 
 Also, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to me in private.

 I cannot find any info about this on Google but i&#x27;m sure Cisco makes different digest for same key that used in AAA configs. I verifed it with Clearpass cluster also.
 Are you familliar with this?

 Feel strange asking this as someone who has done networking for about 25 years now but this just seems so weird to me. I have never interfaced with Cisco Nexus before, and have no idea how this network is setup(other than badly). Just got access to the devices today.
 I&#x27;m trying to setup monitoring of the switches and one of the Dell switches is giving me trouble. It&#x27;s not an issue with the switch, the issue is I can&#x27;t ping that switch from some systems on the network but can from others. There are two switches side by side 172.16.1.23/16 and 172.16.1.24/16. The problematic one is .23, I cannot ping it from at least 2 different windows servers(internal windows firewall is disabled) on the same subnet but can ping it from a linux server on the same subnet. I assumed at first …</span>

Every iteration of a speed test provides different results not to mention each brand of speed test also provides different results. Regardless if the speed test is over vpn tunnel or NOT on the vpn tunnel it is inconsistent as well. Is there generality/commonality constraints or variables that I can use to educate the pseudo Network person on why they are not getting full ISP bandwidth and why it is inconsistent?

 ​
 We have purchased an Aruba 2530 48G (J9775A) switch which i plan to use to replace a number of really old HP procurve 2512 (J4812A) switches, they are currently connect by Fiber module (J4853A) 
 Do you know what the equivalent SFP module would be for the Aruba? im unable to cross reference the parts?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>What are best practices when it comes to gaining visibility into OT networks, so that one can start better segmentation and applying more security, and in the end safely extracting data that resides in the OT enviorement? 
 Im having several discussion with both Cisco, OT vendors and customers regarding the best way to start such projects. Some says that SPAN/RSPAN into Micosoft Defender for IoT or equivalent product is sufficient, others say that SPAN will create problems and one must get Cisco cybervision and switches with sensors.
 Anyone have experience or some advise on what to keep in mind in different scenarios? I know that the Cisco solution works fine, but in big networks it will get really expensive.

                              <span>I have been looking for a Trainee Network Installer job for a couple of years now but there haven&#x27;t been too many in my area.
 I am wondering if I should get a CCNA certification to maximize my chances of landing a role but I&#x27;ve heard from interviews (I&#x27;ve asked if the company offers this cert in interviews) that it&#x27;s not required to do the role and the same goes with CNCI.
 There&#x27;s an trainee installer role I&#x27;ve been interested in but they don&#x27;t offer CCNA certification, only the CNCI. 
 I ask because taking CCNA will come out of my own pocket and if a Network Installer firm doesnt specifcally look for it and says its not needed then I wouldn&#x27;t take it. I know that CCNA is one of if not the most popular IT course so it shocks me that a trainee position in a network role doesn&#x27;t offer it as part of their programme.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am in the early stages of getting started with Ansible for some network automation. Currently, use cases are small for now (update helper-addresses, NTP servers etc) but I expect to go further down the rabbit hole and maybe leverage it for full site deployments.
 Anyway, one of the things that is being discussed is integration with Jenkins CI/CD. As a pure network engineer, I honestly have no idea how Jenkins works and what is involved with it and why it would be beneficial to us but none the less I will need to research it.
 So first question, is there any resource out there (book, blog, youtube etc) that gives some good insight into Jenkins purely from a network perspective? 
 And finally, is Ansible Tower considered CI/CD? Ansible Tower to me seems just like a GUI for pushing playbooks which would obviously make it more user friendly for someone who want to push a playbook but not have to write the code in Ansible. Example, would be that I create a bunch of playbooks and someone else who is not fully up to speed, could just come along, modify the variables to the relevant devices, and then push it out. Is this what Jenkins tries to achieve?

                              <span>Hi, as TAC is telling me they can&#x27;t help before tomorrow i figured i might give you guys a shot. 
 We have a new Firepower1150 we are attempting to add to our FMC. We see traffic arriving on both ends using TCP dumps, however it keeps throwing a &quot;could not establish connection with device&quot; error. 
 In the pigtail logs i see the sftunnel establishing, then it seems like it keeps looping on this &quot;sfmgr:sfmanager [INFO] Waiting for RPC service to be published on peer&quot;
 If anyone has encountred this issue before any and all help would be apreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been experiencing a weird issue with my production dell L3 router S6000-ON. Once a week or soall of its port-channel members ungroup and then immediately group back up (I have lacp long-timeout set). I turned on RSTP and LACP debug events but it essentially just logs the fact that those ports ungrouped and not the reason why they did it in the first place. No alarms or other environmental thresholds were reached. I&#x27;m trying to find some kind of event or traffic burst in my network to explain these events but it is difficult. I&#x27;m trying to think of ideas of what I could check to figure this one out.
 I changed the firmware from the older to the latest but it didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.
 ​
 I noticed some possible causality on one of my access switches connected to the router. I was migrating my router from old hardware to new and the issue of port-channel flapping moved to the new after moving this particular access switch (although I can&#x27;t be sure). I noticed that port-channel for that switch has counter for &quot;giants&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure if that can have any affect on the switch itself (giants &#x3D; packets that are greater than the MTU size).

 Am working with a partner on industrial SD-WAN deployment , we are evaluating more than one vendor. The question is : Does Versa has industrial/ruggedized ? I could not locate any within data sheets!
 Appreciated.

                              <span>It took me almost all day to track this down, so I just thought I&#x27;d share. Early this morning, I was investigating what appeared to be packet loss on our several hundred megabit fiber internet connection. I contacted my ISP and had them check everything, but everything was pointing to our core router. 
 On the router itself, I noticed dozens of connections from our internal workstations on the LAN, going to handfuls of the same destination IP addresses located at various Akamai CDNs on port 443. The issue had gotten so bad, that I had to block the offending connections at the router level just to stop it from causing all of this packet loss, because it was maxing out our internet connection, and our Mikrotik CCR1036 router couldn&#x27;t handle it.
 At first, I thought this had to have been Wind…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 Are there any guides for how to administer FIDO physical security keys like Yubikeys for an entire team/organization?
 The biggest hurdle I would expect to see is a user losing their key. I don&#x27;t understand how organizations which require all users have physical keys handle this on an administrative level, and I am struggling to find any real world examples/best practice documentation on it. 
 I understand for any account fully controlled by your organization (such as Microsoft 365) that a lost key can be handled from an administrative portal. But how do you handle a lost or broken key on accounts that you do not have full administrative control over, such as a social media account? If you require your staff to register a backup key, does that not create other issues (my knee-jerk reaction is end users would end up carrying the backup with them so they can always have it to register both at once, or would forget to bring in the backup key so it never gets registered, both of which defeats the purpose of the backup key) or do you require that the IT department register additional keys on MFA setup?
 Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this just something that sysadmins just deal with? It would seem to me that the best way of solving this would be if a YubiKey/similar product could be &quot;paired&quot; so that one key could register both itself and a cold backup key that is stored elsewhere (held by IT in a corporate use case) without having to carry both.
 Thank you for any insight,

                              <span>Bunch of layoffs just happened and I&#x27;m inheriting basically the entirety of the I.T. department responsibilities besides our I.T. director (who was not apart of these layoff decisions). My manager was pretty shit at documentation or even letting people know when changes occurred. 
 I&#x27;m a desktop support guy and need to learn a bunch of things VERY quickly. I only have my A+ certification and have very limited (if at all) network, server, or security knowledge. I&#x27;ve done some things but it&#x27;s not something I would&#x27;ve put myself in charge of.
 Besides jumping ship, I&#x27;m looking for some resources to up my game up rather quickly. My director is going to attempt to get the company to pay for some trainings for me, but budget was the reason layoffs happened so.... we&#x27;ll see.

 I think it could be KB5022405? Is there anything we can do to fix the issue this update causes? Or is there a reason why Microsoft did this on purpose?

                              <span>Says &quot;The Guardian&quot; this morning. The machines are complicated and incomprehensible, and take more than five minutes to learn. “When I see a printer, I’m like, ‘Oh my God,’” said Max Simon, a 29-year-old who works in content creation for a small Toronto business. “It seems like I’m uncovering an ancient artifact, in a way.” &quot;Elizabeth, a 23-year-old engineer who lives in Los Angeles, avoids the office printer at all costs.&quot; 
 Should we tell them that IT hates and avoids them too, and for the same reasons?

                              <span>Hello, I have set up a DFSR on my server A. The folder is called &quot;share&quot;, and it is replicated on my server B. All this is working fine, but my question is: is it possible that if my server A is down, my DFSR switches to my server B, because when I stop my server A, server B does not take over. I have enabled sharing on the replicated folder on Server B, the path is correct, but when I click on the folder in question from a client machine, it cannot access it. There is no problem with NTFS permissions or GPOs, I am testing on a dedicated ESXi. Server A has the role of ADDS, DNS, DFS and DFSR. Server B has the role ADDS, DNS, DFSR.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Specifically, Chrome (of course). One of our customers had a previous RDS setup where some process/software on the backend was terminating any Chrome sessions when a user disconnected their RDS session, in order to free up the memory/CPU cycles. Been doing some light searching around this today and have not seen any good solutions so far. 
 Anyone have a way to do this with native tools? Perhaps something along the lines of using PS to output disconnected sessions on each session host, then outputting the processes each session has, looking for chrome.exe?

                              <span>My internet has been dropping daily for the last couple of weeks. I restart the modem and everything is fine. I try to call support and I am not permitted to speak to a human unless I go thru the troubleshooting process which will have me restart the modem. That will fix the issue. There is no way to report an intermittent issue. 
 Any way on to the issue: my ssid is similar to xxxxxHome. After not doing the modem reset, I got to a tech. They said that any ssid that contains the word “home” causes issues. Must be a new feature, because the ssid hasn’t changed in years.

                              <span>I’m looking for the most successful ways of doing this. It seems it makes sense to consolidate the application with the least amount of data and configurations. 
 Have you done this?
 What did you do to help convince stakeholders that the chosen tenant was the right one?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello folks,
 it&#x27;s hard to find a lot of info regarding this topic. What self service solutions exist that offer the ability to offer forms and scripts to teams to order stuff like VMs, IPs, etc. pp. and also have the ability for something like an approval workflow where certain teams have to approve certain orders?
 Thanks already

                              <span>Ok, so I have a real strange one. Windows 11 (why did I upgrade)?? Outlook 365 (NEWEST VERSION) after about 4 hours becomes unresponsive and when restarting the application it will get stuck on LOADING PROFILE. Like all good sysadmins I did my google searching forever on this and there is not one thing (rebuild profile, reinstall Office, repair OST, rebuild OST, turn off bad add-ins that do nothing but slow you down, reset the navpane, everything) that hasn&#x27;t worked. The ONLY thing that works is once it gets into that state, a quick reboot fixes it for another 4 hours. I keep saying 4 hours because it&#x27;s been close to clockwork when it happens 4-5 hours later.
 Talk about an annoying piece of crap. We all can have our rants on crappy MSFT software updates and programming. However, I have had a few other users with the new version of Outlook with similar issues, but the beforementioned methods have worked (but it eats up precious time none of us have). The difference with my users is they are all Windows 10, and I was the idiot that was smart enough to upgrade to Windows 11.
 Any thoughts? Other than the IT guy is an idiot (I hate that I can&#x27;t even figure out my own stupid issue)? Sure, I can drag MSFT into it (and probably will if I can&#x27;t get it figured out) but I thought I would turn to the much smarter guys first.
 Edit 1: Outlook will still hang even with an attempt to load in Safe Mode...
 Edit 2: I have deleted fully all OST&#x27;s and rebuilt from the server twice now, not that either..

                              <span>Hello,
 I have currently issues with installing KB on WSUS itself. I downloaded the .msu file from microsoft catalog and when I try to install it on the WSUS server it keeps failing with the error message: 
 &quot;Some updates were not installed&quot;
 Error example: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hyTrLMmPo2E/hqdefault.jpg 
 It&#x27;s the same behaviour for all KBs.
 I have tried to run DSIM to clean the windows updates on the server but no luck:
 DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
 Myserver is a virtual machine on Windows Server 2012 R2
 Any ideas to advise on this matter please?
 Thank you guys!

                              <span>Seeing lots of RD gateway issues today: &quot;The digital signature of this RDP File cannot be verified The remote connection cannot be started&quot;
 ​
 Happening across many companies and different Windows servers from 2012 R2 to 2019.
 ​
 The cert on the RD Gateway is fine but the certs are all issued by Sectigo so perhaps that&#x27;s the issue.
 ​
 Quick fix is to backup the RDP file and remove the signing details from the end. 
 ​
 Is anyone else seeing the problem?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Currently using Sophos EPP for Endpoints which comes with Web Filtering included. Moving to SentinelOne for AV, so need another product to fill that gap. Our Endpoints are mainly laptops that can be in the office, WFH or WFH on our corp VPN.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of options; Mimecast Web Security, DNS Filtering products (Umbrella, WebTitan, DNSFIlter) and nothing has blown me away. All have weird quirks, seem quite easy to circumnavigate. I hear the next &quot;step&quot; is to go to some form of CASB, but wondered what your thoughts were?

 ​
 I&#x27;m running 3rd software on Windows Server 2016 on VMWare.
 AFAIK , The idea behind the so-called &#x27;best-practice&#x27; of 1.5x RAM has its roots in the 1990&#x27;s when RAM was very expensive. 
 There is a lot of advice out there talking about setting the size to 1.5 or 2 times the size of the memory that is installed.

 To this extent i would love some feedback on current (2022/2023) ressources / implementation guides or even books on this subject. 
 Most of what i find is either 2+ years old or mainly general descriptions.

                              <span>So a weird question I know, but I work as a computer tech for a office products company. We provide IT services to whoever wants it from computer repair/ upgrades to installing and troubleshooting whole networks. My co worker and I would like to move away from the computer repair side and more onto networking stuff like switches and routers and setting up networks. Anyone have a idea on how to do that?

                              <span>I have two 2016 DCs that are outdated. The KB (KB5018419) update, which broke Kerberos, was not installed. After a successful installation of the latest CU (Feb 23, KB5022838) that includes a Kerberos fix on DC1, I encountered the error (Event ID 37: The Key Distribution Center (KDC) encountered a ticket that did not contain information about the account that requested the ticket while processing a request for another ticket).
 Updating DC2 to the same CU did not resolve the problem.
 Additionally, the printers shares are broken, and the main issue, an oldy software that uses SMB1 on two servers (2008 and 2003)- shares are not accessible by PC name anymore, only by IP. SMB1 is disabled on the rest of the servers and PCs in the domain.
 any tips?
 i guess error might dissaper after 5 days with renew kerberos tickets but the rest.

 I have two DC-servers in my home environment with Win Srv 2022. Both have been running since last summer without any problems. I have a few other servers and some desktops connected to mydomain.local.
 A month ago i switched out my firewall at home to a box running OPNSense. At that time i also started using VLANs. The plan was to move everything out from default LAN and i started moving some servers to VLAN 100 (MGMT) (they were already joined in the AD at that point).
 IP numbers of the servers in question:
  
DC01 192.168.1.201
 DC02 192.168.1.202
 ADM01 192.168.100.140
 APP01 192.168.100.151
  
The DNS on the domain controllers is:
 1, Second DC
 2, 127.0.0.1
 The DNS on the other servers are

 I still have a few years to go to retirement so there&#x27;s still a chance but, for now at least, I fee liberated!

                              <span>Understand that cctvs are prone to hacking and I just happen to have one installed at my house recently. I’m keen on setting up a VLAN for my CCTV at home to minimise chances of my CCTV being hacked, as well as reducing the chances of other devices in my home network getting their security compromised.
 How do I go about doing this and does it cost a lot to setup a VLAN for my home CCTV? It would be great if I could have an idea of the exact equipment I need to purchase as well as a cost breakdown. Further, is it really necessary to have a VLAN set up to prevent an occurrence of hacking in a home network?
 I don’t have much technical knowledge in this aspect so a layman explanation would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

 In our environment we have some problem with inserting online pictures in office applications. 
 If you try to insert (or search) there is the following message:
 Its in German, so in English it would be something like &quot;Something went wrong. Try it again later.&quot;
 Anyone know this? 
 I googled it and there was some posts like &quot;internetoptions&quot; but didnt helped.

 We are working with a company who are on Google workspace. We are having a lot of meetings with them using Teams. We have added them to our tenant as guests but find they have a lot of issues joining. What is best to advise here? I&#x27;m thinking of telling them to use the web app and not log in to avoid any account/compatibility issues.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ll try to keep it as short as possible and go straight to the point:
  
Within our company we all make use of Office365.
 We make use of a Hybrid Azure AD system.
 One particular colleague has the issue that he keeps losing connection to the Exchange server within Outlook. This always happens after 1 or 2 hours of working.
 All other applications keep working fine.
 He closes Outlook to restart it again, yet Outlook won&#x27;t start anymore then.
 He has to reboot his laptop to make it work again, only to have the same problem occur after 1 or 2 hours again.
  
I&#x27;m running into a dead end what I can try here, this is what I&#x27;ve tried so far:
  
Quick repair of Office in Control Panel
 Online repair of Office in Control Panel
 Reinstalling Office
 Enabled Wireless Radio Control within BIOS (read somewhere that enabling this could help with the issue, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t).
 Reset the user&#x27;s password through www.office.com, while connected directly on our company network (to make sure the sync between Azure AD and our on premise AD is done correctly, as this has been an issue sometimes in the past).
 Removed the Outlook profile and made a new profile.
 Probably countless other things that I can&#x27;t think of right now.
  
Does anyone know what else I can try? It&#x27;s getting really annoying, especially for the end user.
 ​
 Thanks a lot for the help!

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 quick rant here but I need to get some steam off.
 I had a Website and some other lightweight stuff on my Oracle Cloud running.
 I was using the always free tier and was really happy with it until this happend:
 My Account got permanently terminated without ANY Reason, If you try to talk to support, they will just tell you that they cant do anything and swiftly close your Chatwindow. No Support Numbers are working whatsoever.
 So my quick piece of advice, do NOT use Oracle Cloud. 
 Love you all, have a nice day. &lt;3

                              <span>I belong to a school that allowed me to create my username, which is also my email address, and password from the web. No in-person on-boarding. 
 Those credentials (SSO) allow me to sign into macs and windows computers, not only the one in my desk but also any public terminals (library), albeit my documents only stay on my desktop Mac (they don’t sync to any Mac I log into). 
 Staff can bring their own devices and are able to use their SSO to access MS office, PeopleSoft (student information system), VPN, Adobe, DocuSign, Canvas, etc, all of which are downloaded directly from the developers or are web-based. Mixing personal documents with work documents isn&#x27;t discouraged because the important stuff (student records, financial stuff) can only be accessed on campus with school WiFi or a VPN for remote work.
 It seems only on-campus Macs and PCs are managed with MDM. If an employee prefers to not use their own computer for work, they can be issued an on-campus computer, in which software is downloaded through a program. 
 What is the technical description for this type of system? How can one replicate this for their own organization? 
 Is it easier to use cloud based products and manage a SSO instead of deploying and managing devices?

                              <span>Hello,
 We are about to migrate some customers to azure ad joined devices. They are all domain joined right now. We would love to keep the user data / settings and move it to the new azure ad joined profile on the device. It would also be great to migrate the installed printers to the new profile. How would you guys handle this?
 Edit: As some extra information, the reason why I am asking is. This company has users who feel very special, entitled, we already have to do some 1 on 1 sessions to make sure everything is allright. So we will touch all the devices, but some of them are not very IT knowledgeable and would freak out because there printer is not working or something is wrong with their device
 I have no issue in using third party tooling if it would make life easier for the users...

 I’m having trouble making much sense of sticking around here.
 Are there any job boards or sites that show companies willing to relocate/work visa sponsor someone? Just myself and a couple of cats… want to get far away from all of this.
 Looking for I.T. related sites/information that you can pass along to help me out.

 I am using Veeam-One for a small environment with 5 hosts and about 100 VMs. Although retention is already on &quot;1 month&quot;, I am reaching the 10 GB limit of the database.
 As the SQL-standard-license is quite expensive for such a small setup:

 Are you aware of any good methods to reduce the data-usage without using important features of Veeam-One?

                              <span>Hi, has anyone had any experience with Dialpad VoIP system in Australia/New Zealand. We have recently shifted a portion of our business to use the cloud service to replace the previous telephone system but have noticed significant latency issues especially at the start of calls. My gut feeling says as the call session initiates with the &quot;Global SIP Network&quot; as they call it, it gets rerouted quite a bit which slows it down. I&#x27;d just like to know if anyone else has had subpar performance for Dialpad in Aus or NZ?
 Note) Did an Ookla speed test with an end user today reporting issues and they 278 down 114 up with 4ms to server, so I&#x27;m thinking very unlikely an issue on our side.

                              <span>I&#x27;m winding down my tenure with my current company. Leaving on good terms after 5+ years. The senior engineer is going on vacation for 2 weeks at the start of April. He floated the idea of me freelancing while he&#x27;s out. I&#x27;ve covered for him before. What I haven&#x27;t done is freelance. 
 I haven&#x27;t committed to anything yet. What considerations would I need to have in place before accepting an offer like that? Want to make sure I&#x27;m not putting myself in a bad spot if something goes sideways while I&#x27;m covering.

                              <span>Hi!
 (I have kind of the same issues as mentioned in this thread.) 
 I am working with ansible automation towards different cisco switches in my company and I have specific issue with VTY lines on IOS-XE 17.x 
 So on 17.03.04(9600) it looks like this: 
 9600(config)#line vty ?  First Line number 9600#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 
 And on 17.06.04(9300) it looks like this: 
 9300(config)#line vty ?  First Line number 9300#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 line vty 16 31 
 And that in itself is okey(pretty f&#x27;ing annoying tho), but the problem is when i try to remove excessive lines.
 On the 9600 it&#x27;s no problem, but on the 9300 i get this error:
 % Can&#x27;t delete last 32 VTY lines 
 Anyone has experience with this, and what did you do to solve it?

 I spent some time searching, but I am not able to find the right resources for my problem.
 My goal is to be able to login using SSH with my keyfiles using putty.I found this article: https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1000178166/3467af6a/configuring-an-ssh-user
 but, I am not able to import my public key. Am I missing something?

                              <span>Heyall. I work for a small WISP (about 1200 customers) and there&#x27;s a lot of stuff I am needing to learn. Learning Cisco and learning Linux have both been &quot;easy&quot;. I put easy in quotation marks , because yeah the subject matter is kind of difficult, but at least there&#x27;s plenty of resources out there. LTE does not have nearly the amount of learning resources. 
 We just bought some licensed LTE spectrum , so our CBRS LTE will now be accompanied by real licensed LTE. 
 Id really like to know how all of this stuff gets implemented. Ever since I started here back in August of last year, I&#x27;ve been trying to find some reading material or some sort of course on this stuff but not really sure where to start.
 Anyone here know LTE pretty well? If so, what resources did you use to develop your proficiency on the topic?

 I am trying to integrate Checkpoint firewall with Aruba ClearPass for TACACS. I couldn&#x27;t find any dictionaries available for CheckPoint in ClearPass or even the profiles. The plan is to configure basic AAA services with Checkpoint read-only, read-write and super admin roles. Can anyone please help me with the configurations to be done at both Checkpoint and ClearPass side?
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>I have added a &#x27;Custom field&#x27; within Netbox&#x27;s wireless groups to obtain the URL for WLCs to manage my APs. The custom field includes the WLC&#x27;s IP and port.
 These objects are further called into custom &#x27;links&#x27;, that will show as a button called &#x27;Wireless management&#x27; with the underlying url defined as https://{{ obj.cf.WLC_Managment.address}}:{{ obj.cf.port }}
 As I&#x27;m using the wlc IP address and the port as the object type, the URL always includes the subnet mask as shown below
 https://10.1.1.10/24:4343
 I can use &#x27;text&#x27; in custom field instead of an &#x27;IP address&#x27; object and get around the issue, but would like to see how I can use the IP address as an object and remove the subnet mask from the URL.
 I tried the following but that didn&#x27;t work
 https://{{ obj.cf.WLC_Managment.address | split(&#x27;/&#x27;) | first }}:{{ obj.cf.port }}
 anyone know how do I get the url as https://10.1.1.10:4343 in netbox

                              <span>I am trying to perform a little market evaluation of the top players for remote worker solutions in this post COVID world of 2023, and try as much as I can my Google ability has failed me, I wonder if I can reach out for help from community to get the basic info I need to present.
 What I simply need is some (very unscientific) numbers for what peers are using for your remote worker / remote access solutions, that I can then just reference in a &quot;top 5&quot; or so solutions I can dig a little deeper in some further comparative research.
 Can people just post the solution they use, or upvote if someone has already posted the same solution.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all I set up policy based routing yesterday and it was all working fine.
 Vlan 1 10 40 to use wan1 Vlan 20 30 50 to use wan2
 Odd thing today
 Vlan 10 and 50 are picking up dhcp but not internet Vlan 30 still works fine and so does vlan1 - these are on different wans so the internet is working fine on both wans.
 I&#x27;ve restarted DNS. Renewed dhcp etc but can&#x27;t figure out where it&#x27;s going wrong.
 UI edgerouter X is the router.
 Any ideas where to start looking? TIA

On a central building I will install a 19 inch rack with all the goodies, including a metal 12x dual-LC termination box for the single-mode fibers. Now I am looking for a small, preferably wall mount box, to terminate the fibers in the other buildings. Must exist, but I am probably looking for the wrong thing on Amazon and other sites.
 The buildings will all get a 4-fiber cable, with two dual-LC connectors. Any tips appreciated.

I recently added a web server on the cloud and I want the load balancer to include this server in its configuration. Do I need to establish a VPN between the two on-premises servers and AWS to make this possible? is there any better way to do so? is it a bad design ?

                              <span>Slightly strange request....\
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with setting up temporary wifi and internet for a building. There are 3 floors and each floor is c. 80m x 50m. The floors are largely open - no walls, just empty space. We do not have access to the building&#x27;s internet and we may (or may not) have access to normal consumer-level electricity supply.
 It just needs to be be there for a couple of weeks. 50 wifi temperature sensors will beplaced on each floor and will connect to the wifi and transmit their small amount of temperature data to a cloud service.
 I&#x27;m thinking we will likely need three 4G mobile internet routers (one per floor) and then a wifi access point (or more than one) for each floor. And possibly a UPS for each floor to supply the power to them - although hoping that electricity will be possible.
 No floor-to-floor cabling will be allowed and only minimal, exposed cabling allowed on each floor.
 So I guess my questions are chiefly:
  
Will one WAP per floor be able to deal with 50 low-data devices and the 80mx50m area?
 If so (or if not) what devices would you recommend
 Anything else I ought to be thinking about?
  
Thx

                              <span>Hi guys,
 a consultant is strongly proposing us to use the router in object to substitute old Cisco Asr1002 as BNG, and to be used to terminate our geographical links between our datacenters where VPLS / VXLAN / EVPN are concentrated to make DCI 
 Do you have experience with this router? Aside from the china vs US competition, its cost/hw_specs is quite unbeliavable, and when something is too good to be true, usually something is hiding... 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hy all,
 I have an interesting problem. We are a small ISP/MSP and our upstream provider told us that users from two of our /24 IP ranges send very excessive DNS queries asking for the IP address of a.root-servers.net (their engineer told me that there were times when it surpassed google by a significant margin, even distorting their statistics for site queries).
 Now I am wondering what could even cause this; especially as there is very little overlap in infrastructure between the two IP ranges (and one of the ranges have a significant infra overlap with other unafected ranges)? Have any of you seen anything similar ever? Could it be a bug caused by a auto update of a common CPE brand?

                              <span>Hello,
 We support some customers which are doing DMVPN , they mainly create multiple vrfs , one for the DMVPN it self , another for breaking out guest traffic and so on, i want to understand what is the purpose of the RD under the VRF on the local CE Site? isn&#x27;t supposed this rd value be configured on the PE Instead ? what is accomplished by this configuration?

                              <span>So, we work for a real estate company, roughly 300 people. The CEO, CIO and President have built a habit of calling our help desk techs directly (or emailing / chatting in Teams), anytime they need IT assistance (even non-emergency ones). They have never submitted a ticket, which is what we want them to do. But they won&#x27;t listen, no matter how kindly we ask.
 their secretaries typically will submit tickets for them. But that rarely happens since they don&#x27;t go to their secretaries first when something goes wrong.
 Part of us is like, &quot;eh, they are at the top of the pyramid.. whatever.. just help them then open a ticket for them and move on.&quot; Another part of us is like &quot;no, they need to follow IT policy like everyone else!&quot;
 Just curious if this is an issue for the companies you work for? And how strongly you enforce the &quot;open a ticket before I can help you&quot; policy with the &quot;higher-ups?&quot;

                              <span>Hi all,
 just hoping for some assistance. 
 It&#x27;s a bit of a noob question, but im struggling to understand and implement 802.1x auth on my office&#x27;s wifi.
 I&#x27;ve created an nps server, added the Meraki AP&#x27;s, added the secret to the AP&#x27;s, and configured meraki to go to the NPS server. But my sticking point is installing and correcty configuring the certificate my boss gave me for the task.
 I&#x27;ve had very little to do with certs and whilst I understand the concept of pki I don&#x27;t understand how to implement in practice.
 Like I put the ssl cert in the personal store on the server and the 802.1x policy then let me choose it as the certificate to authenticate against. But then what part do i need to add to a users computer, and how do i get that out to them?
 I&#x27;ve just become massivley confused and would love if someone point me in the correct direction.

                              <span>So during an unscheduled conversation with my manager the bomb was dropped. I have to pick either be all in as a manager or be an admin/automation. This meeting was not contentious at all, the company is great and I&#x27;m still enjoying the time. But now I may have to lay down the ones and zeros and pick up the PowerPoint.
 It all kind of feels like the time I was with my dad when he told my grandma it was time to give up the car keys.
 So a bit of soul searching.
 I&#x27;m curious of your thoughts.

                              <span>So one of my end user computer got a BSOD today when he tried boot into windows. I have tried a couple of things such as re-plugging the HDD, resetting the BIOS, performing System Restore, Booting into Safe Mode but as you guess it, everything failed. The error persists, now I&#x27;m down to the last resort which is to reinstall windows but before going thru that, I was wondering if there is any other things I could try?
 Edit: I have also tried running chkdsk /f /r and sfc /scannow but both didn&#x27;t help much. The chkdsk didn&#x27;t find any bad sector. The disk have 4 partition and everything is correctly labelled such as C: Windows, D: New Volume, and also 1 Recovery partition and another system reserved partition. It seems like it does detect the HDD but couldn&#x27;t access the boot sector? I might be getting the wrong idea but that is what I understand.
 Edit 2: I decided to just reset the PC since I don&#x27;t have all day and user need it fast. I thank you for the suggestions that everyone gave me.

                              <span>In a new environment with poor documentation, I think past sysadmins have been lazy and removed inheritance deep on file shares. I would like to run a scan from the file servers to show me any folder that deviates from the parent folder on permissions. This way I can validate its business purpose, give it a proper security group and put users back into it. Then I can update new hire request forms to ensure new employees have the right permissions from the start.
 Any program or script to do this, or is there a better way then just nuking from the top and hoping I do not expose confidential info?

                              <span>throaway account out of an abundance of caution.
 I work full-time IT at a non-profit organization and there really isn&#x27;t a ton of work to do. I work under an IT director and we&#x27;re just a 2 man department.
 My boss is a total workaholic and it&#x27;s hard to get him to delegate stuff to me, so I feel like working with him is a competition in my own head to try to jump on top of any work to be done because if I don&#x27;t do the work within 5 minutes of it coming up, he just does it.
 Because the org isn&#x27;t terribly large, we end up running out of work to do pretty quickly, and I start to get a little nervous that I&#x27;m not doing enough, or that I might get laid off or something if I don&#x27;t continue to prove my worth to the org.
 The org I work for is actually awesome. I know a common perspective people have is to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck because &quot;coporate overlord dont care about you, employee,&quot; but this org has been amazing to everyone with very generous compensation, org-wide raises that consist with inflation and THEN some, great benefits, and an overall healthy and productive environment/community of people.
 So, I really want to be doing more and being more useful because I feel like i just don&#x27;t do anything all day and it&#x27;s eating away at my soul every night lmao.
 anyone got any good suggestions? how do you keep growing when there isn&#x27;t a fire under your ass?

                              <span>I did two interviews recently and was offered the sysadmin job. However since they only gave me midrange on the salary I counteroffered near the top end and then they just said &quot;I had withdrawn myself from the position&quot;. This was after I pointed out it was a 100% onsite job and that their offer was not commensurate* (edited, thank you /u/mudclub) with the cost of living in the area, especially housing. 
 There&#x27;s a big difference between withdrawing and being lowballed.
 I&#x27;m interested to hear from my fellow sysadmins on how salary negotiations have gone from an offer to employment or to just turning your back on a potential employer.

                              <span>This seems crazy to even ask, but I&#x27;d love to know if people have done it. I have a four post rack with adjustable depth where the post is a bit too close to the door. As it happens, it&#x27;s about as empty as it&#x27;s going to be right now. One server and one storage array that needs to remain on. And another server I can shut off.
 Has anyone ever, with equipment mounted, slid the posts forward or back? It requires loosening a couple nuts, but they&#x27;re in a track so it doesn&#x27;t look like any equipment could actually drop. But obviously I&#x27;m most concerned about vibration, and that&#x27;s the top reason I think this is a really bad idea. All three sets of rails mounted in the rack are adjustable depth.

 For those of you who use Veeam, what storage target(s) do you use? What target would you use if money was not an issue?

                              <span>Who remembers the Sun v880 (like a 16U, 300 pound behemoth)? - if you did not extend the legs from underneath the rack in to the aisle and pulled the server out for maintenance, it would pull entire rack over with it.
 Or the Sun rack with the PDU in the base, and when you were running cables from under the floor in to the rack, you&#x27;d inevitably hit the damn power switch and shutdown 1/2 the rack (IF... you cabled your power supplies correctly).

                              <span>So, I started testing out the new craze that is ChatGPT, messing with PowerShell and what not. I&#x27;s a nice tool, but I still gotta go back and do a bit with whatever it gave me.
 While doing this, I saw a ticket for our MS licensing. Well, it&#x27;s been ok with everyhting else I have thrown at it, so I asked it:
 &quot;How is your understanding of Microsoft licensing?&quot;
 Well, it&#x27;s been sitting here for 10 or so minutes blinking at me. That&#x27;s it, no reply, no nothing, not even an &quot;I&#x27;m busy&quot; error. It&#x27;s like &quot;That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m out&quot;.
 Microsoft; licensing so complex that AI can&#x27;t even understand it. It got a snicker out of the rest of the office.

                              <span>I initially had the whole story outlined, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary as I know this happens to all of us. What do y&#x27;all think is the best way to handle such situations?
  
Karen clients: User thinks they know what they are doing, messes up, then calls IT. I offer solutions and the less practical one is declined in favor of the more expensive/complicated one. Then they call my boss/co-worker/etc., who gives them the exact same [simpler] solution, which they take, and claim I never offered it.
 Agent 99 situation: My boss/co-worker/etc. already knew of the situation and my solution. Then they offer the exact same thing as if it was their idea.
  
EDIT (FEB-28-23): The most common and upvoted suggestion seems to be document, document, document. At this point I don&#x27;t know how much is paranoia and how much is reality. We are down to 40% staff and it&#x27;s either document or let things go. This particular situation is a wireless network with lots of environmental, feeder controls and alarms for live animal experiments. The person who put it in place was fired and the documentation is all out of wack. At the same time that the Karen client is adding/moving things in the network without consulting. Literally 0 minutes to sit down and Document everything in the ticket, as it flows so quickly and the karen does not read them (and once claimed IT almost killed their experiments)

                              <span>We&#x27;ve used Umbrella and DNSFilter but looking to move away from a paid client for budgeting purposes. Any tips for still having some sort of DNS protection/security. We don&#x27;t do much filtering but would love to still protect against ads, trackers and malware. Easy enough to enforce Quad9 on-prem but what about roaming devices? Use Intune to set or force a DNS server? Any tips? We have Bitdefender but it appears to mostly do broad category filtering.

                              <span>We handle lists for users now. We get request for group membership/managers/creation. We would like to get owners/managers to start taking on this responsibility. Because these lists are on-prem, and devices are in Azure, there’s not much users can do to manage these lists. I’m curious as to how you handle this on your end. I was thinking about possibly migrating these groups into Azure, but not too sure on any repercussions of that change. I also thought about a 3rd party tool, but it may not be worth it, if there is something I can do with what I already have. Appreciate any thoughts or comments you may have. Thanks.

 Quick question here. I am creating a 16TB storage array for a video surveillance system and was wondering what Allocation unit size would be best for this type of system? I was thinking 4096. Also, ReFS? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I work 9-5, Monday to Friday. I do my fair share of late nights too to get through the work. My manager will consistently schedule meetings for late Friday afternoon, and it absolutely wrecks my head. And these are not short meetings, they are usually big topics that could definitely wait until Monday
 I think he is a major **** for doing this so often. I want to keep my Friday afternoon free to tidy up loose ends, schedule my diary for the next week, etc. NOT to start something new. I want to finish at 5 to spend time with my kids, have a beer and relax. 
 He does not have family and lives alone so I think he doesn&#x27;t have much of a life outside work. 
 Any ideas how to approach? An invite just landed in my diary for 16.00 this Friday. I&#x27;m feeling very annoyed and don&#x27;t want to attend, but what excuse to use!

                              <span>Hello, I have configured a HP server, with local disk drives, with 2 RAIDs. I had to provide a name for the logical drives and accidently provided the same name for both RAIDs. Is this an issue? I can not change it now.

                              <span>Wondering if anyone has came across this before. A VM has been migrated to Azure (a handful have) and since then RDP takes 2-3 minutes to log on. Just sits on &quot;welcome&quot; then eventually logs in. These migrations were done before I joined. Everything in the subscription that has been built fresh logs in straight away, migrated VM&#x27;s all have this issue. Not a massive problem but this is stopping me installing our MFA app as rdp times out before can get in, had to uninstall it via powershell in the end. Anyone come across this behaviour before?

When researching it, it seems that another machine is trying to connect with it using ciphers that are not supported on that machine. How can I find out what machine it is coming from? Is there any logs with more info that I can check?

                              <span>Hi, hopefully this is the place i can ask these types of questions. Ok so, i want to create a task when an app closes itself or someone closes it, with task scheduler i want it to run the app that has been closed and only run the app when it really is closed. I hope it can be done with task scheduler, anyone know how can i do this?

                              <span>I built a Domain controller (Windows 2022) on VMWare workstation. Static IP address of course. Server is named HomeDC.home.local. I Also installed ADCS. I then installed a Windows Server to act as a web server to demonstrate the process of requesting a certificate AND certificate revocation. After adding the certificate to the default website on IIS, opening the page, webserver.home.local, says the server session is not secure. I can see the certificate on the web page, yet it still says its not secure. what am I missing?

 This is what I&#x27;ve done so far;
  
Checked to make sure the Schema version is compatible with Server 2022 (it is)
  
Code:
 Get-ADDomain | fl Name,DomainMode Get-ADForest | fl Name,ForestMode 
  
Created the new DC&#x27;s, installed roles
  
Code:
 Install-WindowsFeature -name ad-domain-services,DNS -IncludeManagementTools 
  
 Promoted the new VM&#x27;s to DC&#x27;s in AD

                              <span>Seems like many of the legacy systems I interact with as a user have this. Banks, web portals for hospitals, and the like. This is where a user logs in with their credentials and then is shown the &quot;security image&quot; they picked out, like an airplane or a flower or some other random object. The page usually says something like &quot;make sure this is your security image!&quot;
 I can&#x27;t imagine this is supposed to sway those with criminal intent, is it supposed to prevent users from logging in to other accounts?

                              <span>Hello,
 i wrote a thread some weeks ago about performance issues on our RDS farm. I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).
 So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.
 For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. 
 Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). 
 I&#x27;m quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users. Its quite hard to see the real workload on other infrastructures. 
 So, could some people tell about their sizing in situation there the users doing a simiar workload?
 Thanks

 We have some users who need to be able to amend the COM ports in Device Manager on a regular basis, however we don&#x27;t want these users to have domain or local admin access. Does anyone know is this is possible and secondly, could this be done by Group Policy or via Regedit?

                              <span>We&#x27;re in the process of designing our back-up strategy in Druva. Druva offers a &#x27;Data Lock&#x27; option which prevents your back-up data from accidental/malicious deletion. 
 Let&#x27;s say an IT administrator accidentally back-ups a 5 TB VM with Data Lock enabled. (which should not be backed-up at all) We would than have to pay for the storage consumption for this VM the entire year? There is no work-around to overcome this? 
 I know this is the purpose of immutable back-ups, but cost is also a big factor when using cloud back-up solutions like Druva.

 As a form a security mesure for my school project I want to only allow a computer to join the domain if a computer account was provisioned in the domain.
 The expected behavior is that a randomly named PC can&#x27;t join the domain even if it&#x27;s using correct credentials.
 I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation online (Or i&#x27;m not using the correct words), do you have any idea on how to do that ?

I know I need to wipe and re-enroll them with a new enrollment profile to get them into AAD fully, but if i were to offline the domain controller, would they continue working from AAD?
 Or do i need to wipe and redeploy the entire business in one go? I&#x27;m guessing not because that seems impractical for large business.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We have a client coming on board for support and would like a VPN. Normally we&#x27;d configure an SSTP VPN but in this case port 443 is already being routed to their webserver from the internet.
 If I forward another public port (say 414 as an example) to 443 private and point to the VPN server, would this work?
 I&#x27;d wager the connection address on SSTP client on other connecting windows endpoints would be vpn.CERTNAMEHERE.co.uk:414?
 Can you poke holes in that theory or point me towards a better solution?
 Besides another static IP that is referenced on the DNS entry to get to the WAN IP I&#x27;m struggling to come up with ideas.
 TIA!

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am new in a company and have noticed that the Windows firewall is deactivated on almost 3000 servers. The reason: The effort to configure the firewall is too great or the Windows firewall would be pointless anyway. I would now like to change this situation and gradually activate the firewall on all servers. The problem is also that the necessary IPs and ports are hardly or not at all documented.
 ​
 Now my question: How would you proceed to achieve this goal? Simply switching on the firewall would instantaneously paralyse most servers. Firewall
 My idea would be: First document the active connections with netstat and write corresponding rules, then activate the firewall with Allow-Any for a certain time and then study the log to find more IPs and ports.
 ​
 I am curious about your suggestions and thank you in advance for your ideas.

                              <span>We usually don&#x27;t get information from HR when someone&#x27;s manager changes for example and thus cannot change those attributes in AD.
 How do you guys manage attribute changes (like department, title, manager etc.)? 
 Do you let HR do it themselves? If yes, via which way?

 I&#x60;m posting this for a colleague that has a problem on an VM running Windows Server 2019 about Task Manager.
 After you open task manager and on the tab Processes only Status, CPU, Memory are displayed and disk is missing. when he tries to enable the option its not available, its greyed out.
 The account used is domain administrator but this happens with a local admin account as well.
 Did someone stumbled upon this or could you help us with the direction to check with might cause this, maybe some settings in the registry.
 Thank you,

 https://files.fm/u/5fmkv6s36
 I also tried this script but unfortunately this profile continues to be active:
 Get-ItemProperty -Path &quot;C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Packages&quot; | ForEach-Object {Remove-Item -Path &quot;$_\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin*&quot; -Recurse -Force | Out-Null}
 ​
 Do you have any idea how to permanently delete this profile?

                              <span>Hi There,
 I am having an issue in our enviroment which i can&#x27;t crack yet. 
 We migrated to M365, and let people work on their workstation. We offer some apps (including M365) as remote apps through RDS. We use Windows Server 2012 R2 (yea yea i know, we are upgrading asap)
 For the people saying, why don&#x27;t use the local M365 apps. Our back-office system only works good on TS-systems and needs Outlook and word for some functionality. 
 The issue is, when people open attachement in this outlook app or from our back-office system. The outlook &#x27;home&#x27; page (The page with inbox and all your e-mail) stays as the focused the screen. The openend attachement or e-mail from our back-office system stays behind that outlook screen until you open it from the taskbar. 
 I am getting the feeling it is an Server 2012 R2 issue or a remote app issue. When we used RDS with desktop for our users, they didn&#x27;t have this issue but we used Office 2010 then and Exchange 2013.
 Thanks in advance,
 Kind regards,
 Roy de Jonge
 p.s. English is not my primary language, i am sorry for any mistakes in spelling or grammar.

 Is there a reliable method to block signing into Azure AD joined devices if user has an active Global Administrator directory role. Is this also possible via Conditional Access? Or should other means be used?

                              <span>Can someone confirm my thoughts on Group Policy Link Order.
 My example is:
 I have a group policy object assigned to an OU named Site1.
 With 2 GPO&#x27;s applied, which apply the same setting, on one the setting is Enabled, the other the setting is Disabled. One GPO is named PolicyObject1 and the other is PolicyObject2.
 PolicyObject1 has a link order of 1, PolicyObject2has a link order of 2.
 PolicyObject1 will be applied first, then PolicyObject2 will be applied, overwriting PolicyObject1.
 Am I correct, and if so, please can you provide some Microsoft Documentation regarding this? I&#x27;m fairly sure this is right, but I need the documentation to prove it. Thanks :-)

                              <span>Hey!
 We have been tasked with designing and deploying WiFi for an entire property of 150+ units, we are thinking about using UNIFI AP’s along with a cloud controller to handle the volume of devices. Any ideas for UN/PW management? We were considering using UNIFI built in Radius but that requires a UDM which can’t handle the amount of AP’s or PFSense Free Radius however unsure the smartest way to connect the 2. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello, 4 months ago I enrolled to Junior Network Administrator job because the previous Network Admin left. Before that I used to fix network issues on a basic level remotely. I was chosen because I was very interested in networking, internet and I would study at home while others wouldn&#x27;t. I have learned to configure switches like Alcatel, HP, 3Com, Nortel, Dlink, Dell, Netgear on a basic level. Vlans, port isolation, loop protection, troubleshooting why it wouldn&#x27;t work. We have only mikrotik dude to monitor entire network. We use only mikrotiks.What would be the best network monitoring software to monitor network for free? I can&#x27;t take care of my network if I can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on in it properly. The dude only displays bandwith after 24hrs. Service up, down with notification to telegram is setup so we can react quickly. Zabbix + grafana, prometheus + grafana?How to take care of network properly? What to monitor? What are free gpon monitoring tools? Zabbix seem to increase cpu load of gpon. I have basic understanding but I want to get better and take care of my network. I have to take care of a few data rooms, switches, security, I need to see what&#x27;s going on my network in switches, gpon, I want to get better at this. I was working for free to get any experience previously just to get hired somewhere. I found my favorite thing. Networking. When I like this, I have motivation. Could you help me? I need good material how to take care of network properly. Thanks. I&#x27;m not alone there&#x27;s a Senior Network Admin that takes care of servers, the work load is huge, when to learn? :) I want to help him. I&#x27;ll put less stress on him by taking care of my side of network. Help me a bit. Thanks! I feel like CCNA + Mikrotik Courses would be best atm. Which I&#x27;m going for.

 The ceiling is gyprock, then there&#x27;s a ceiling cavity roughly 1-1.5 metres high, with manhole access, then a concrete ceiling above that.

 There are existing cables run in the cavity - lighting, data, AV etc., as well as HVAC ducting
 There are some existing vertical metal rods, and some of the cables are cable tied to those - however, in general, most of those are loose, and there aren&#x27;t that many rods.
 My question is - if you were running new CAT6A cabling in this space - would you put the cables in some kind of conduit? Or how else would you keep them supported and tidy, and also in case you wanted to change them later? (I seem to remember something vaguely about supporting them in bundles, but can&#x27;t find the reference).
 Or would you just loose lay the cable on the gyprock ceiling itself?
 Or what other techniques do people use?

                              <span>Hello networking !
 I have a quick question for any pro installers out there. 
 I&#x27;m in the process of commissioning my new recording studio and I have my friends teenage son who&#x27;s interested in systems integration/audio production (kids these days) on site after school to help out with testing and to learn some wiring skills. 
 I&#x27;m teaching him to terminate RJ45&#x27;s and having him try to make some short ethernet cables (the first of which have been deliciously atrocious) and I wanted to give him a sense of what would be expected in a pro environment in terms of skills.
 I&#x27;d categorize my personal networking install level as apprentice+, this will be my third studio I&#x27;ve wired and with various other projects I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ve terminated maybe 600-700 cables in my &quot;career&quot;. I had to terminate about 60 cables for this one and I messed up 2. 
 From the audio wiring perspective I&#x27;ve probably terminated 6k balanced channels and I&#x27;ll mess up maybe 1 in 150ish. 
 My question is what the error rate would be for a professional installer, I&#x27;m guessing it would be 1 in 200ish but frankly I don&#x27;t have a clue. 
 Any edification would be much appreciated, also would be curious as to how long it took any of you to learn this skill.

                              <span>Potentially a daft question but which SFPQ modules and fibre would I use to connect a 544+FLR QSFP to the 40gb port on the nexus?
 Also is this normally what one would do? It’s for a storage server to a bunch of hypervisor for virtual disk storage.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I work at a small company. Recently, I have been tasked with setting up a VPN server so that employees can access certain company resources remotely. I contacted the ISP and requested a static IP address block. However, I am unsure how to respond to the ISP&#x27;s followup question about the configuration.
 For context, we are using CenturyLink/Lumen as the ISP and our hardware is part of the Unifi family. We originally planned to use an OpenVPN server, but recently discovered it was possible to run a VPN server directly on the Unifi hardware.
  
Your new LAN IP block is aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa/29 and it is statically routed to bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb. However, how would like us to configure the new IP block on the managed CPE, is there a specific interface you prefer for us to configure the new block on or statically route it to your LAN (Which next hop IP should we use) so you can use the whole /29 block?
  
What does &quot;interface&quot; mean in this context? Is this something on their end, or does this refer to our own hardware? Should I tell them to statically route the block to our LAN and provide the local IP address of our (network gateway? router?) as the next hop?
 I apologize if this is a stupid question, but our consultant has not been much help with this and I am a fish out of water here.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I work in a small business (just a bit bigger than mom-and-pop shops) and I have encountered an issue. We are expanding and have bought a building about 100 yards away for part of the office to move to. We have already installed a new modem/router from our ISP on a separate account and have it up and running. Now that the situation is explained I want to know the best way to go about this problem. 
 The people that are moving from building A into building B still need access to a shared file that is hosted on one of the windows computers. (not the way I would create a file-sharing system but it is what I have to work with.) The plan is to connect the network from building A to the new building B so they can access the locally shared file. I want to configure it so they can access the locally shared file on that network but the new ISP connection will handle all of the actual internet access. 
 Any help or recommendations would be appreciated. Feel free to ask about anything I left out.

Below is a copy of what I&#x27;ve written up in that period. If there are any mistakes or adjustments that need tweaking or adding to it, then please feel free to say.

 Electromagnetic radiation signals transmitted at certain nanometers are what allows for the use of different waves and rays (xray, UV, radio waves etc...) The lower the nanometer (on the right of the picture), the more energy that is outputted from the signal and can pass through certain objects (human skin/tissue, but not bones, such as xrays) to that fine a detail, and t…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I am looking for a UPS battery backup for some our network equipment. The switches are located across the building, but our main area includes Netgate 7100, 2 Ubiquiti Switch Pro 48 PoE, and a UNVR.
 Netgate 7100 - 120W while idle should be at 20W
 2 x Ubiquiti Switch - 60W with 600W (PoE), up to 660W per switch
 UNVR - 100W
 ​
 I would like to keep things running for approx 10 minutes. Any UPS recommendations? What should I consider when buying UPS?

                              <span>Any time systems or helpdesk or apps team or whoever is asking about a route/switch/firewall issue, I answer their questions or provide info and typically include a snip from the output I used to gather said information. 
 It&#x27;s just occurred to me that I never see anyone else do that, and I&#x27;m wondering if this is an obnoxious habit on my part. 
 It originated from dealing with some of the server folks or helpdesk folks seeming to imply I&#x27;m responding with &quot;it&#x27;s not the network&quot; without actually looking, so instead I prove I&#x27;m looking and showing them what I see to sort of &quot;nip in the bud&quot; any implication that I&#x27;m being dismissive, but now I do it out of habit. 
 Am I just an odd duck, or do some of you folks do that too?

To my understanding it should support it just fine, but I cannot for the life of me get it to work with a cisco switch using AES256C. I don&#x27;t think we have any devices on our network that use 256 that aren&#x27;t cisco. 
 I can snmpwalk to that device successfully, and I have the same credentials configured within Netdisco (Which I believe USES the net-snmp library) but no luck at all no matter what I try. 
 Netdisco works great with our AES128 devices.
 Any tips on what I can try to get Netdisco to communicate to devices using AES256 or AES256C?

 I&#x27;ve looked into the original datasheet, in a cisco live presentation and looked for the chip specifications (Qumran-AX) but I rly couldn&#x27;t find what i need

                              <span>Hey All, 
 So I’m new to packet loss issues – this is my second network job but first time I’ve had to deal with it. So it seems like there is intermittent packetloss stemming from one specific device in our network… our Nexus 7706. At random times nodes all over our network stop responding and the common denominator is they are all patched to the 7706. They don’t all go down at once but when an event occurs you can be assured it’s patched to the nexus. It’s very random in both the time it happens as well as the devices it happens to – but again all uplinked to the 7706. 
 So my question is – where would I begin on troubleshooting this? Any real world advice here? This is where those damn ccna books do nothing for you… and unfortunately I’m a one man shop so I don’t have anyone to seek guidance from.

There is a second ISP that connects to the HA firewalls and the equipment from that ISP has multiple ports for WAN and a WAN switch isn&#x27;t needed on the second ISP link.
 It is a 24 port switch and I plan on using interfaces 1-12 for the WAN VLAN (to avoid using VLAN 1 and all 24 ports). I&#x27;ve already added the WAN VLAN and added those ports to that VLAN.
 The mgmt interface will be used for local access/configuration.
 Here are my questions (so far).
  
I&#x27;m going to confirm LLDP isn&#x27;t active on ports 1-12.
 I&#x27;d like to configure SNMP to only send data to my internal SNMP server. I&#x27;ve seen switches/network devices that have fields/commands to send SNMP data to specific servers, but I&#x27;ve also left those fields blank and I can still log into my NMS and pull SNMP data from the switch given I have the correct information.
  
I&#x27;m currently reading through the 3900 manual to confirm the LLDP and SNMP commands, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions that I may be missing to avoid leaking out data/information that should be avoided on the WAN side.
 Traditionally we&#x27;ve never done anything fancy to WAN switches, they are just L2 switches that we throw into the mix and we&#x27;ve also never had any management other than a local console cable IF a change needed to be made. Going forward, I&#x27;d like to change this and given that I have a local network port for management, I&#x27;d like to secure this switch the best way that I can.
 The default credentials have already been changed.
 Thanks.
 Edit- In other switches I&#x27;ve used, the management port is usually listed as out of band. I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case for this 3900 switch.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m experimenting with a Juniper SRX and it seems static routing isn&#x27;t as straight forward as it would be on a Cisco.
 I have my SRX connected to an L3 switch, with a network either side. On the L3 switch I&#x27;ve issued the static route command and set next hop as the Juniper interface that connects to the L3 switch.
 I added a static route in on the Juniper also, with next hop as L3 switch interface. However, when trying to ping from the Juniper network into the L3 network, my gateway comes back with destination net unreachable. In fact, when I logon to the Juniper over SSH, and try pinging the L3 switch interface, I get &quot;no route to host&quot; and when I look at the Juniper routing table, I see an entry for the L3 switch interface listed as a &quot;rejected&quot;.
 I read somewhere that you can&#x27;t simply add a static route onto a non point-to-point link on a Juniper. If that is the case, can someone explain how I can configure a basic static route on here?
 Many thanks

                              <span>I have a small mobile IOS router/switch device that is used for traveling clients. Essentially just a single site-to-site vpn back to an ASA, with a built in switch module. There is a single WAN interface where the crypto map is applied. This interface is public facing and is designed to be plugged into any commercially available IP (hotel, i.e. airport hotspot, etc) 
 We’re debating whats the better security practice on setting up controls on the WAN interface to only allow the IPSEC and ISAKMP traffic in. Is there any advantage or better practice to using ZBF on that port than just a simple inbound ACL that allows only those protocols though? Seems like the same end state from a security stand point

                              <span>This is a small segment of our network, so this is really just one of the VLANs. We have about 70 houses (and a business office, and a school, and ...) that share a single internet connection. All the VDSL modems connect and work well. They can talk to the router, 172.23.72.1 and to devices on the other VLANs (172.23.68.10 for example). However, they cannot talk to each other and I&#x27;m baffled.
 The DSLAM is a Huwai MA5600/MA5800 with 4 VDSL cards. Transparent VLAN setup in the DSLAM. Everything gets an IP address fine. Each DSL modem has a &quot;public, but private&quot; IP from our internal network and then does NAT for devices in that house.
 DSL A cannot talk to DSL B. I&#x27;d like to be able to put a server/NAS behind A and access it from B. Presently, if I have a server behind A I can only access it from other VLANs on the network or devices not connected to the DSLAM.
 Anyone have any ideas what I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hello, I have small business where there are two computers that are nowadays connected to 1Gbps switch that is plugged to the rest of the network. These two PCs would benefit from faster lan as they both work with the same data stored on one of those PC. The question is - can I add 10Gbps lan card to both and connect it directly without switch, while keeping the connected by 1Gbps switch? Or would this double connection intrferee? I don&#x27;t need faster connection to the rest of the network. I&#x27;m on tight budget, I was thinking about buying something like zyxel XGN100F (~150USD each) to both PC and premade optical cable (~20USD). Switch with two SFP ports would add ~180 USD that i would like to spare. Thanks!

 I&#x27;m currently designing a 3U electrical box, and in the past have used these 19&quot; rack mount Hammond enclosures. However, for this project, I could really A. use the extra 4 inches and B. all the racks it&#x27;s being put into are 23&quot; anyways. I know Hammond (and others) have 23&quot; rack mount shelves... but I really need an enclosure. 
 Any chance I can have the best of both worlds? Thank you in advanced!

We have looked at using MAP-T in some new areas since our supported customer router supports it. Does anyone have any experience with MAP-T subscriber management? What solutions are there to automatically assign blocks of ports to subscribers using DCP. We have Infoblox and could script this type of thing, but I’d rather have a solution that just works out of the box.

                              <span>I have a collapsed core in vss, and my L2 access switches are hanging off the collapsed core. The only L3 device is the collapsed core. I would like to separate some network from the global table using vrf lite. I want to start with the oob ports. I checked the Cisco docs but didn&#x27;t find how can leak routes between the global and vrf lite within the same collapsed core switch without sending the traffic to the next hop (provider). It is more like a inter-vlan but one of the SVIs is in global and the other is in vrf lite.
 Is there an easy and proper way of accomplishing what am trying to do?

 Preferably their spine series Z or leaf S series. Thanks a lot!

Checked AP configs and up time. AP isn’t rebooting and last join time is also stable. From client debugs, observed the following:
 EAP-PARAM Debug - eap-params for Wlan-Id :1 is disabled - applying Global eap timers and retries
 Found a bug and applied the workaround to disable aaa override but the issue is still there.
 WLAN configuration looks fine.
 Cisco 5520 wlc 8.10.171.0
 Any suggestions or ideas about this issue?

                              <span>It was tough to come up with a title to sum up what I&#x27;m talking about but here are the details:
 We&#x27;ve got half a dozen offices and we are in the process of changing the WAN vlan at each one. Here&#x27;s a very simplified diagram of one site with a made up subnet:
 https://i.imgur.com/lIDZX3R.png
 Like I said, this is a very simplified diagram but the part in question is accurate. I used the green arrows to show how traffic is flowing from outside to the local LAN. During this change I&#x27;ve got a constant ping going to a host inside the local network from another location across the MPLS.
 The process is:
  
I ssh into the WAN switch from outside (MPLS)
 Select all 4 interfaces at once
 issue the access vlan command
  
At this point I lose anywhere between 5 and 10 pings and then the connection comes back up. Now, I&#x27;m reasonably certain that the lost pings are caused by something to do with the MAC address table on the switch but I&#x27;m not 100% and I&#x27;d really like to understand specifically what causes the brief disconnect. I started labbing this up in GNS3 but I quickly realized that the switch emulation isn&#x27;t good enough to accurately simulate this scenario.
 If this isn&#x27;t enough detail I&#x27;m happy to provide more in order to help identify what&#x27;s happening.

                              <span>We have an M365 group that is being used for office-wide communications. Some users complained that they are not receiving messages sent to the group (in their inbox). We discovered that some of them have changed their Follow in Inbox settings to the &quot;Only Replies to You and Events&quot; option. I found a way to force a setting change for members, whether they are subscribers or not, but nothing is stopping them from manually changing this setting gain the future. 
 Get-UnifiedGroupLinks $Group -LinkType Member | % {Add-UnifiedGroupLinks -Identity $Group -LinkType subscriber -Links $_.Guid.toString() -Confirm:$false} 
 Is there a way to permanently force a particular setting on a M365 group and prevent members from changing their setting?

 I work as a security engineer for a MSSP, where in one of the projects i am responsible for identity security and PAM - i was almost burnt out and took some time off (a week)
 Yesterday was the first day off - and i start getting calls on what to do with this and that? By my clueless colleague. Who could have put some effort into learning crap… WHEN I WAS NOT ON LEAVE!!!
 I mean - you gotta hire if you want good talent and i am in no way an expert in what i do but man the dependencies 😒

 How do I deploy a registry entry to a GPO on my server? Can I somehow restore the &quot;Registry&quot; GPO option?

This is due to the proprietary pinout of APC Smart-UPS serial cables.
  
Today I needed a USB to serial cable for a switch&#x27;s console. That switch is on the other side of a huge building, so I wanted to test it before making the trek. I had found an old radioshack usb-serial adapter and plugged it into an inventory laptop, installed putty and went to the rack to look for a serial port to test it on. Ah ha! Look right here, an unused one on this UPS. Let us see... what&#x27;s that beeping... ... why is my phone ri... oh shit... zomg wtf really!?

                              <span>Spearphish attempt came as a fake reply to real e-mail that was several years old, from a vendor that had an email compromise.
 The attachment is a password protected zip with the password in message body and something about being unable to send the attachment otherwise (very true in this case).
 Extracted first payload contains large .htm which uses HTML smuggling to drop a second zip file with same password while putting up fake Office 365 page telling you how to open it.
 Second payload contains an .img file which mounts a filesystem and includes a .lnk shortcut to unleash the nastiness.
 From here everything is deeply obfuscated and resistant to being run in a sandbox. Proceeding any farther would require downloading payload files from the Internet and alerting the sender so this is where I stop for now. Even posting the filenames they use could leak information. I will say that the payload files all date from June to November 2021.
 The whole thing closely matches the technique described here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/
 So that&#x27;s fun.

We have now completed an exhaustive investigation and have not seen any threat-actor activity since October 26, 2022. During the course of our investigation, we have learned a great deal more about what happened and are sharing new findings today. Over the same period, we invested a significant amount of time and effort hardening our security while improving overall security operations. In today’s update, I’ll review those measures and highlight additional security steps that we are taking.

                              <span>So we have this guy that works... &quot;works&quot;... with us and we&#x27;ve noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don&#x27;t have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I&#x27;m working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn&#x27;t have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn&#x27;t really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don&#x27;t really have.
 So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it&#x27;s not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.
 NOTE: 1.) My boss can&#x27;t fire him, he&#x27;s been trying. 2.) He&#x27;s tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn&#x27;t work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as &quot;All you can do is talk to him.&quot;

                              <span>My company is pushing for certifications again; seems they aren&#x27;t as high as competitors are. Their solution? Tell people to go get certified at MS and they will reimburse for the exam fee.. for some certs... as long as its in your &quot;role&quot; (so Servers can go for Azure, Desktop for M365 and you cannot leave your lane), No time off to do them, its either during the 40-50 hours you are &quot;allocated&#x27; to a project or on your personal time. No reward for completion except a &quot;badge&quot; (ie congratulations email) if you complete several (&quot;its expected you complete training as part of your role&quot;).

 Anyone else in the same boat?

                              <span>So as the title says I believe that the company has lost all their data. There was a storm overnight that turned the power off for a while and when everyone came in this morning computers turned on like normal except the &quot;server&quot; (Win10 machine with all shared files on it). Basically the machine would not boot windows. Plugged the SSD into another computer and saw the data was RAW instead of NTFS. I have to format the drive in order to use the SSD again. They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren&#x27;t even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there&#x27;s an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they&#x27;re cheap and refused saying they&#x27;d do it on their own.
 Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V. SSD has Been sent to data recovery center

Due to the CEO being married to an optometrist, I was asked to evaluate her office network...to call it a disaster would be kind. Now I apparently own IT for this office. :\ I need to get rid of the Netgear home router ASAP, and am initially inclined to use a Watchguard T25, but these are pretty pricey when hardware and license are included. Wondering what others have used that provides solid security with granular control?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I am about to buy a new laptop, for my job. My job consists of a basic office work, excel, word, outlook and little bit of graphic design, photoshop. In my free time, I like to play games, mostly Dota 2, warzone.
 So I started to look for a laptop, for office work. I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 € (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). 
 Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? 
 My best options I found on the web so far:
 Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,
 Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black 
 All of these are approximately 800€ (you can suggest different). Besides that, I am have a desktop PC at home, mid tier gaming machine, but sometimes I work from outside my home. I dont have any laptop right now.
 Thank you your replies, I appreciate all of the advices and shared experiences.

                              <span>We had a major power event at our main data center yesterday. Maintenance was being performed on our UPS, something went wrong and we lost all power to all of the racks including our production Nutanix cluster (5 hosts, ~120 running VMs) and our main backup repository (Dell Data Domain). I was shocked when we powered everything back up and there wasn&#x27;t a single data corruption issue (that we have found). In hindsight, I know I should have shut everything down gracefully ahead of time but they assurred me it was routine thing that they do all the time and it wouldn&#x27;t cause any issues. That should have been the red flag.
 The point of my story is....we&#x27;ve come a long way in recent years in terms of preventing data corruption. I remember a time when pulling the power on a SQL Server while running would almost certainly mean recovering databases from a backup. Chalk one up for progress.

Recently we hired a few guys, but they are directors title, mostly ask for project reports/ status or just talk, like get this done this week and get that done next week.
 At the end , still nothing much is getting done. We have 2,3 guys doing the work, and 2,3 guys project coordinator/ director, just keep asking for progress/ updates. I know project coordinator and those director title actually provides high level planning and decisions making functions! But still us needs to make things happen and get things done! The IT department head recently just told us , if no progress / updates with projects , will directly impact our performance reviews! So bad! what’s the issue there? What should I do? I feel like I work my ass off every week, busy with tasks here and there and daily operations tasks! I am quite new to sysadmin roles!

                              <span>Morning fellow nerds and geeks,
 I need some advice on my career trajectory. I&#x27;ve been working for a company for 10 years and I recently moved into a management slot overseeing our department. It&#x27;s a small shop, but a really good company and I was really enjoying it.
 Fast forward to a few weeks back, and we were bought out. It&#x27;s looking like I&#x27;m going to be back in a sys admin position. While it&#x27;s not terrible considering I have the same wage, seniority, and WFH, I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;ll hurt me moving back into a management slot. I&#x27;m concerned that the longer I&#x27;m out of the position, the harder it&#x27;ll be to move back up.
 What is your experience with this? Is my concern unfounded, or should I start looking again? We&#x27;ve not moved over to the new company just yet, but it looks like there&#x27;s no management slots available and likely won&#x27;t be for some time. The current staff have all been there for a long time and don&#x27;t look to be moving on anytime soon.

 I am getting a remote job. They will provide me with a laptop to use. My friend says they have done VPN audits in the past. Is there anyway to get away with my location saying I&#x27;m in us when I&#x27;m not?
 I&#x27;m thinking:
 -just use a proxy to change ip and not draw attention by encrypting data?
 -set up laptop at friends house and just remote login to work?
 Any other options? Please help

                              <span>Hello! My parents have a business with a large variety of jackets in 3 different locations with over 1000 jackets. What I want to do is make a inventory system which can be accessed from each of those store locations using a barcode system with a barcode reader and a inventory software. 
 Simply my goal with this software is to see: - Quantity of a certain product by location - the sizes available of the product
 I dont need the software to be linked with the cash register.
 For example if a product is sold. I want to scan the barcode and decrease the quantity of how many of the products is left.
 Or the exact opposite. When new products arrive i want to print a barcode and stick it on the product and then enter it into the inventory system.
 I understand that for this i will need
  
multiple barcode scanners
 barcode printer
  
Have you guys ever worked with this type of software and also which software is the best and cheapest for this system.

 But I wanted to verify they are working correctly before start building my raid 1
 So I planned this
 First I will do Long Sanitize Overwrite in SeaTools latest version
 Then I will do Long Generic Test read test
 If no errors that means drive is perfectly good
 Can we say that?
 Also started 3 disks Sanitize Overwrite and looks like gonna take 48 hours is this expected?
 In task manager i see some of the disks gets 100% then gets reduced and gets 100% again. randomly. not all the time 100% used.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I work for a mid-sized company of about 160 users.
 We&#x27;re currently looking for a secure web gateway kind of product. We previously ran a POC of Netskope, but this didn&#x27;t turn out very well for us. We&#x27;ve looked at other solutions such as Zscaler, Perimeter81 and Cloudflare One, but I&#x27;m curious to know what others have used in this space and how effective those products have been.
 The main things we are looking for are:
  
Filtering traffic(DNS, HTTP, Network based, etc..)
 Can provide some kind of secure access to non-public facing web apps.
 Has some kind of Malware filter for web traffic.
 Detects shadow IT usage. - Defender for cloud apps does some of this, but doesn&#x27;t seem super robust.

                              <span>Not come across this issue before so hoping someone else has. I have a customer with an Epson 7830 printer but his laptop will not detect it via USB. 
 Printer works fine on other laptops, his laptop works with other USB devices, no AV or Firewall blocking it. The only thing I noticed is it once said low USB power when I initially started troubleshooting so I got a powered USB dock but no joy. Also tried various USB cables.
 Just wondered if anyone had any thoughts? I&#x27;ve sent the laptop to Dell but it&#x27;s come back saying USB ports are fine (which I assumed).

 I would like to stop using AD admins for logging on to systems - for this I would like to create an AD group that will be set up via GPO as local admin on our servers&amp;clients.
 Even though there are no admins that are only assigned to certain areas - does it still make sense to create one AD group for clients and one for servers + 2x individual users that can either access all servers or clients as local admin?

                              <span>My company is looking into buying a monitoring and reporting service with basically the feature set of MXTOOLBOX.
 Blacklist monitoring and alerting, SPF, DNS, DKIM and DMARC Checks (+RUF) and so on.
 But as mxtools, dmarcly and so on are from outside of Europe, my company isn&#x27;t keen to buy non-GDPR compliant services ( and our procurement apparently doesn&#x27;t want to get into international payments...). 
 Long story short - my research wasn&#x27;t really successful, so here&#x27;s my question to you: Are you aware of any such email security service hosted in Europe?

                              <span>Hi all,
 My team has recently expanded from a couple of people to a much larger group. We now need to securely store some passwords and logons that the team collectively need, eg for accessing administration websites. I am looking for a suitable piece of software (Win Server) or website that would allow us to store these securely and ensure access for the team, while allowing us to grant / restrict access to specific individuals. Ideally this would be cheap, or free, as we are education/public sector.
 TIA

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have the problem that the Windows 11 Click-Here-To-Upgrade keeps displaying in Windows Update. 
 A GPO is active with the setting &quot;Select the target Feature Update version&quot; set to 21H2. The GPO gets applied to the laptop. In the registry I can see that it correctly shows the target build, but the Windows 11 upgrade message stays.
 Any idea&#x27;s? Thanks.

                              <span>Hey guys, I apologize because it&#x27;s probably a dumb question but im new in the sysadmin world (started the apprenticeship earlier this year) and was tasked by my boss to implement an app called Make Me Admin (https://github.com/pseymour/MakeMeAdmin) into our Azure and write a powershell script that, when executed, would install it and also change the setting of the app to grant the user admin rights for 60 minutes instead of the default 10 minutes.
 On the github page OP said to change values one has to go to
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin 
 But after installing the app, that key does not appear in that path (or any other path), so do I have to create it manually?
 I also wrote some PS code to create the key if its not there with my veeery limited PS syntax knowledge and some AI, but it also doesnt seem to work. While it does install the app (if its in the same directory as the script for now), it does not create the key.
 $software &#x3D; &quot;MakeMeAdmin 2.3.0 x64.msi&quot; $msiPath &#x3D; Join-Path $PSScriptRoot $software if (Test-Path $msiPath) { Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList &quot;/i &#x60;&quot;$msiPath&#x60;&quot; /quiet /passive&quot; if (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ProductFilter -Filter &quot;Name&#x3D;&#x27;$software&#x27;&quot;) { Write-Output &quot;&#x27;$software&#x27; is installed.&quot; # Create the MakeMeAdmin key if it does not exist if (!(Test-Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin&quot;)) { New-Item -Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\&quot; -Name &quot;MakeMeAdmin&quot; -Force | Out-Null } # Set the AdminRightTimeout value to 60 minutes New-ItemProperty -Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin&quot; -Name &quot;AdminRightTimeout&quot; -Value &quot;60&quot; -PropertyType DWORD -Force } else { Write-Output &quot;&#x27;$software&#x27; NOT installed.&quot; } } else { Write-Output &quot;MSI package &#x27;$software&#x27; not found.&quot; } 
 Sorry if the post sounds confusing, I am lost myself rn haha

                              <span>Hi there,
 Please bare with me as my windows admin experience is nonexistent. At the corp. I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.
 So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP&#x27;s so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP&#x27;s just results in the run around. 
 Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?
 I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.
 ​
 Many thanks

                              <span>Heyho fellow Sysadmins,
 we are using a Slack-App to do our permission management. The user fils a short form, a superior and myself accept the form &amp; then I set the permissions manually on our Domain Controller (which is a Synology NAS). 
 So now I want to get this automated. The goal would be to only hit the &quot;accept&quot; button in the slack-app and the permission for the user get set automatically and also get removed after a set date.
 I don&#x27;t really know how to do this technically.
 Maybe you have an idea or direction on how to achieve this, so I can do some further research. :)

 No issues turning DKIM on for domain.mail.onmicrosoft.com but when turning this on for custom domain I just receive &quot; CNAME record does not exist for this config.&quot;
 Should this even be on for the domain.com domain?
 LearnDMARC states:

 &quot;I see you&#x27;ve included a DKIM signature.
 I couldn&#x27;t retrieve the public key from selector1-saundersarchitects-onmicrosoft-com._domainkey.saundersarchitects.onmicrosoft.com and verify the signature. The Auth Result is invalid. &quot;

 I had just assumed that MS did MFA like everyone else with paired app TOTPs and therefore the option to use 3rd party with apps
 Just heard about number matching and enforcement imminent
 I tried the MS auth app w number matching and user experience was aweful. Also it forced me to register my private device to the company, something I can’t expect of users.
 User base is low tech low paid shift work care staff. This needs so be SIMPLE
 I’ve been rolling out SF MFA this last year to different orgs and it’s a breeze.
 Can someone give me some pointers? Also willing to pay an hour or two to help determine my MFA strategy.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m preparing to setup Linux VM deployment for our application team, the goal is to setup a basic VM via template and then deploy the OS and all standard configurations automatically.
 The distros will vary, depending on the requirements, but overall they will deploy Ubuntu (22.04 or 20.04) and RHEL (probably 9, maybe 8).
 For lifecycle management like updates and config changes we will probably be using Ansible, but how could I automate the deployment process across those distributions?
 I am aware of kickstart, but afaik this is a Fedora/RHEL based tool, would it be possible to deploy Ubuntu as well?
 I&#x27;m asking this, because Ubuntu has it&#x27;s own deployment tools, if I get this right, which is Autoinstall/Cloud-Init, and I would prefer to use only one method for both distros.
 What would be the best approach to this, otherwise?
 I&#x27;m sorry if something seems unclear, I&#x27;m pretty new to linux administration (dipping into it right now)
 All answers appreciated!

 I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right subreddit, if it&#x27;s not I&#x27;ll remove my post.
 My boss asked me to remove all local admin users from the domain. Doesn&#x27;t seem too hard so that&#x27;s going to be easy. The hard part is supporting the users which have the local admin accounts.
 Some users need to change their IPv4-Address to work with servers. I fixed this with the local group Windows 10 has which is called &quot;Network Configuration Operators&quot;. All users which need to change their IPv4 Address are automatically added in this Group via a Group Policy.
 Now I wanted to know if I can do the same thing with allowing users to create bootable USB-Drives and give them the permission to partition USB-Disk Partitions. 
 I checked the builtin Windows 10 groups but didn&#x27;t find a group which could enable this. Maybe someone can help me with this?
 Thanks in advance!
 Sorry for my bad english, english isn&#x27;t my first language.

                              <span>Hey All, We have a few Brother PTE550W that we use for asset tags, general labels, etc. We love the labelers, they work well, charge lasts a long time, labels last on devices etc.
 Any tips on designing them in P-Touch editor and getting the alignment to keep when transferring them to the labeler templates for use on the device? We can use the software or the app, but it&#x27;s so nice when it does work that you can just enter in a pre-set field or two and it prints the same everytime.
 For a simple two line label, with two &quot;titles&quot; the alignment never lines up.
 I know some of you guys use p-touch so thought I&#x27;d ask before I pull my hair out over a darn labeler.

                              <span>Hello /networking! 
 I&#x27;ve been fighting the classic &quot;no internet&quot; globe at our primary location for 2 years. It seems to rear it&#x27;s ugly head every 6-10 months and of course this Monday was a classic explosion of multiple computers not allowing Outlook to function even though the internet was connected. I&#x27;ve spent hours...nay days on this. 
 Our standard fix has been:
  
&#x60;sfc /scannow&#x60; &#x60;DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth&#x60; [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet] EnableActiveProbing set to 1 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] NoActiveProbe set to 0 &#x60;[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] DisablePassivePolling set to 1 restart computer 
  
I finally realized that an nslookup with &quot;server 131.107.255.255&quot; to any request fails...pcap shows no response from the server what-so-ever. Confirmed the traffic is being passed by the firewall and no clear blocks from anti-virus. 
 I can do a DNS request all day from other networks and IPs. I have access to a number of sites and all of them respond instantly to a dns query to the classic nds.msftncsi.com IP. Any recommendations on how to find out if MS is blacklisting my primary site IP? Who/how do I contact Microsoft regarding this?
 The above fixes have worked previously but of course today, something has changed and 3 computers continue to not function even after the fixes. I do not have IPv6 running on this network. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks for any rabbit holes I may not have run down. This has me frustrated and stumped. I think the fact that DNS isn&#x27;t responding is my smoking gun but I don&#x27;t know how to take it to the next level.

                              <span>I was explaining to someone today about why we haven&#x27;t adopted the LB sandwich for our NVAs in azure, the reason being that we use a lot of active directory and kerberos and neither of those should be natted. And they asked a good question...
 If the LB sandwich is so popular how are all the people using it out there handling their AD and kerberos? I don&#x27;t actually know.
 Can you all enlighten me to your general setups when it comes to NVAs and authentication? Thanks.

                              <span>My fellow Redditors,
 I am redistributing BGP from my router into an OSPF process located in a VRF (Area 1). My router is connected to the Neighbor Router via Area 1. Area 1 is configured as a stub area. 
 My understanding of a stub area is that it blocks Type 5 LSAs. I am redistributing into the OSPF process that includes the stub area. Since my path would be BGP -&gt; OSPF (Backbone Area 0) -&gt; OSPF Area 1 (VRF) -&gt; Neighbor Router (Area 1), does the Stub router located in OSPF Area 1 deny the Type 5 LSA coming via the Backbone area? 
 My understanding is that a Stub Area does not allow an ASBR to exist within it. My router that is redistributing BGP -&gt; OSPF would be considered an ASBR. However, since I&#x27;m going from OSPF Area 0 to OSPF Area 1 in a VRF, does the VRF act as an ABR (and not an ASBR) thereby allowing the Stub area to receive the type 5 LSA?
 I understand the simple solution is to configure the Neighbor Router as a NSSA. However, this may not be a possibility. 
 Am I overthinking this? It is as simple as I am coming from BGP -&gt; OSPF and the Stub Area prevents that type 5 LSA from entering it (VRF or not)?

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been working on a project that involves taking the existing network of 192.168.1.0, splitting it up into VLANs and creating additional VLANs to allow for a Data Network and Voice Network. I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.
 My configuration is as follows:
 ASA
 int g1/1 - Outside
 int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)
 route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 
 Core Switch
 vtp mode server
 int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)
 switchport access to vlan 10
 int vlan 10
 ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 80
 ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 90
 ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 
 ip routing is enabled 
 So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found so far:
 I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN
 I can&#x27;t ping the other way around
 DHCP is working. I&#x27;m able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.
 I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x
 I can&#x27;t ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks 
 There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Does any one know of any good open standard or general best practice guides for all things networking? I have several documents from vendors, but am looking for more general/not vendor specific material to read up on. Currently work as an entry level engineer at an MSP and am trying to provide a little more value when doing health checks/reviews on customer environments. I am guessing a lot of it just comes with experience, but I’m always being asked about best practice design/architecture, configuration, etc. 
 Thanks!

 I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.
 The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. 
 I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. 
 Am I misunderstanding anything? Would anyone be willing to explain how this might look in a L2/L3 router&#x27;s config? I feel like I am missing something simple.

                              <span>Now that encrypted DNS is becoming more common and Android is supporting this by default a question I believe is very stupid just popped in my mind. TLS certificates require domain names to work so DNS over TLS only works if you provide a hostname instead of an IP address, but if the device is connecting to a network for the first time and the DHCP server only provides the hostnames for the DNS servers then how is the device going to resolve the hostname to connect to the DNS server in the first place? Also, what if I&#x27;m connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option? What is the best way to proceed?

                              <span>Hubs, not switches. We have a site where we need to mirror all traffic in/out of the firewall to a switch port, so it be processed by a security appliance. The issue is that the main switch (Ubiquity) only allows mirroring of one port. This would be fine, except that I have redundant firewalls, with automatic fail over. The second FW is connected to another port on the switch.
 My thought was to put a HUB between the firewalls and the main switch, then plug the monitor into that.

Engenius&#x27;s marketing materials indicate that they can be operated in a &#x27;standalone&#x27; mode without a controller, but it&#x27;s not clear to me if the standalone mode is basically the same UX and per-AP features that you&#x27;d get with the managed options, or if the standalone mode is basically the same as the older EnSky user interface.

                              <span>We mostly have cisco, but still have some Junipers in the wild. Before coming here, 0 experience with Juniper. Anyways, I making a change and trying understand what the functional difference (if any) is between these two commands. 
 set interfaces ae8 native-vlan-id 1 set interfaces ae6 unit 0 family ethernet-switching native-vlan-id default 
 After doing some reading, I think it&#x27;s just the difference in setting that actual ae8 interface to native vlan 1, whereas the second command is setting the logical ae6.0 interface to native vlan default which on this switch is also vlan ID 1. So vlan default &#x3D; vlan 1. Wouldn&#x27;t each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?
 The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don&#x27;t know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing. I feel it has something to do with the above commands.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 we have been running our GGC for some years now, and it gives a pretty constant 1:3 bandwidth saving. We just got our Akamai appliances and I&#x27;m curious how much that will be, probably higher peaks but less consistency. As we don&#x27;t have private customers directly Netflix has not been interesting for now, but I could see huge savings on networks with many private customers.
 ​
 Which appliances are you running and how much Bandwidth do they save for you?

                              <span>Years ago I seem to remember these being available, like a large cable comb with a clamp, you could bundle your patch cords together, hold them in place, replace the switch, and reconnect all the patch cords in to their correct locations. My Google-Fu is failing me on this one.

                              <span>We have been using Nautobot to document and automate out network, and I&#x27;ve come across a use case that I dont think it caters for. We are about to deploy out first WDM campus network, making use of OADMs to split out specific colours along the fibre path. As far as I can tell, Nautobot doesn&#x27;t cater for WDM usage on a fibre path.
 So 2 questions.. is there a way to make it work in Nautobot? If not, what are you using to record and document your WDM deployments and what do you like and dislike about it?

                              <span>We are currently in a proof-of-concept phase for building a centralized network infrastructure for 32 schools, all connected to two datacenters where all servers and core network components will be placed. Our customer has access to Alcatel-Lucent switches with a significant discount. My last experiences with Alcatel were not the best, with them being tedious and slow to configure, but that was about 12 years ago. We primarily use Cisco and Dell for core and access switches these days and I am currently thinking about sticking to what we know best or just going with Alcatel to save money. We are planing to use stacked 48 Port 1G PoE Switches as access switches and 48 Port 25G switches witch MLAG as core switches.
 What are your thoughts and experiences with Alcatel?
 Features that are important for us (apart from stability and support of course):
  
configuration through a CLI interface which can be automated with ansible
 stacking for access switches, MLAG for core switches
 a solid 802.1X implementation with multi-host support

                              <span>Hello Everybody
 We use Sophos for our AV and MTR
 Currently running around 50,000 per year based on last year&#x27;s renewals. It doesn&#x27;t come up until October.
 95% of our users already have Micrsoft E3 licenses which includes defender. 
 Its currently disabled in Intune.
 Would using Defender + Huntress ( Managed Cybersecurity Platform for SMBs and IT Providers | Huntress ) be a good replacement?
 We already use Micrsoft E3s plus a few E5s.
 The users that have business basic don&#x27;t use computers anyway. 
 Am I stupid for thinking of using Defender and not Sophos

                              <span>We can&#x27;t create Windows images on drives not formatted in NTFS. But you can transfer a completed image from an NTFS drive to, let&#x27;s say, a portable exFat formatted drive. Would this somehow break a Windows image once it&#x27;s time to be used?
 FYI, the images I&#x27;m creating are from the control panel --&gt; backup and restore (Windows 7) --&gt; create a system image.
 Edit: My concerns is about corrupting the image because of storing it or transferring the it to non-NTFS formatted storage. I&#x27;m not trying to install the image on a non-NTFS drive.

We want to segment internal access for admins, operations, developers through the use of a VPN solution with MFA and zero trust them based on AD group membership. The problem I am seeing that it doesn’t scale to well as 100’s of users wil need access to multiple environments and the reconnecting and reauth to these diff environments is becoming problematic. Any ideas how to solve this?

There are several things that would be super helpful from setting up MFA to pointing them in the direction of SharePoint, sending them to our quick cyber security reminders video, etc. I could always create a batch file or something with a script flag and send them to a checklist or SharePoint communication site. Just wondering if there’s something more “elegant”.

Im currently wanting to reign that management in some. I absolutely want individual admins to retain full management of their sites. But not be able to go outside of their realm. Many of these sites are OUs under a domain, so domain admin gives full reign across enterprise level organization. Right now, it&#x27;s a real cluster f.
 Im looking at a few different products that will allow us to centrally manage AD and Group Policy using a more delegated approach and added auditing. Pulling away from traditional AD tools and bringing things home to a central interface. 
 I would love to hear some suggestions from other admins on what they are using or have used, pros and cons.

 I really love networking so I have been looking at any opportunities that I could do additionally to my full time job. I have looked into Upwork but I cannot get my profile approved because they say the market is saturated. I honestly don&#x27;t really care about the pay, i&#x27;d even look into doing consulting as volunteer work if there were any opportunities around. I appreciate any help!

                              <span>One of the things I’ve been tinkering with lately is FRR. Really impressed with the features, along with the CLI.
 Just about any routing feature I’d need is present, not to mention the performance is pretty impressive.
 One of the things I don’t see in FRR’s documentation, and this was confirmed by some of the FRR devs as well, is there’s no Netflow/IPFIX/Sflow capabilities.
 Obviously FRR is intended to be a routing suite, and that’s understandable, but has anyone here using FRR found a library for this purpose on Debian that is actively maintained and has enough flexibility to be considered viable for being used alongside FRR?
