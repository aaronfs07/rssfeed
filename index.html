                              <span>I am trying to run my wsl2 ubuntu instance in MobaXterm, however I am seeing strange behavior.
 After a reboot when I try to mobaxterm, then run the wsl sessionI created, it shows a blank screen, then nothing. It may close on its own or show &quot; Network error: Connection refused&quot;. I tried changing the connection methods, none of them worked.
 The only thing that worked some times after a reboot is to delete the session, then rebuild it. Works perfectly again. But this does not work every time.
 What is this, a bug? Anyone else running into this?

                              <span>I have been struggling with a good short metaphor or description between the difference of, knowing what buttons to push to get an outcome, and understanding what those buttons do.
 Ie. Understanding the buttons to push to create a Microsoft team, and understanding each of the options truly, not just following instructions, and how best to use those options.
 Or
 Knowing that a reboot solves a problem, vs knowing WHY the reboot solves the problem.
 Any suggestions on a clearer and concise way of describing the difference?

 After installation on Windows Server 2019, when opening the software, a gray screen appears and it is not possible to continue:

 On the other hand, on a different computer with Windows 11, after installation the software opens and works normally:

                              <span>Hi,
 I’ve got an issue I run into every month with a specific server when patching. When shutting down after the monthly CU has been prepared the server sits at Getting Windows ready… for anything up to a couple of hours.
 This is the only Server that does this.
 It has the following roles 
 AD Domain Controller File Services inc. deduplication 
 The server is a hyper-v virtual machine
 When I open resource monitor on the hyper-v host I can see a lot of disk activity, but oddly it’s on the vhd that acts as the storage location for the file services on the server. 
 There is approx 4TB of data, all small files.
 Can anyone advise why the update process seems to be so interested in that location? Is this normal from others experience of large file servers?
 Any insights much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi!
 iam not sure if its matter where to start robocopy cmdlet.
 For example:
 Source: MS Fileserver
 Target: NetApp Volume
 Would it make a difference to start my robocopy job directly on the source server instead of an admin machine on the same network? When I start the job on my admin machine, would it be a additional hop (cache) for the files, so the copy would take longer?
 ​
 Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some level of understanding with Cisco Hyperflex. We will hopefully getting official training on it soon, but my team is being asked to take over a multi-site Hyperflex solution that was created by, well lets just call them non-IT people to be nice, and my first impression is that it wasn&#x27;t built right. But they insist they followed all the Cisco recommendations. So I have some questions I&#x27;m hoping to figure out before I get called at 3am on a Saturday.
 First, the way these systems are configured is there is 6 VMware hosts, all with 6 SSDs in them, then the 7th server is the Hyperflex management server or something. Each server has a single NIC with 2 ports, 25Gbit, connected to two different switches. Those NICs are handling anything Hyperflex, VMware DRS, VMware Management, storage, and VM traffic itself. 
 Questions:
 1 - I&#x27;ve always gone with the school of thought that 1 single dual port NIC isn&#x27;t very good for redundancy, but they insist this is the Cisco recommendation, are they really right?
 2 - I also would never shove everything through those two nics, is this also Cisco&#x27;s recommendation?
 3 - The storage in VMware looks like iSCSI, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get hands on. Where does the iSCSI adapters on the VMware host connect to as a SAN provider? Is it the management server? What happens when it crashes?
 4 - Is the Hyperflex storage like VSAN where there is a replication delay? if so, how long is that delay?
 5 - They told me DRS should be turned off for Hyperflex. Is that true? IF so, why?
 I guess open ended, is there any other tidbits of info you can supply me? Imagine that you are being asked to support a pair of these systems in different geographic locations, without ever seeing the damn thing ever.
 That&#x27;s me

                              <span>For a project, I need to transfer the disks from ESXi Gen9 server to Gen8 server. I think there will be data loss due to different raid cards but is there a way to do this without data loss?

                              <span>I have been handed a setup with a few ext HDDs with vhdx files that was used for a recovery on a hyper-v setup. 2 of the 3 ext HDDs I can mount the vhdx files, however the last one won&#x27;t mount and my suspicions are because the ext HDD is formatted at fat32. 
 The end users had access to the contents on this vhdx which was mounted on one of the VMs from this ext HDD. I just can&#x27;t see how that was possible considering hyper-v won&#x27;t even boot a VM with this vhdx added, regardless it can&#x27;t even be mounted to be explored.
 Is it possible to mount or attach a vhdx stored on a fat32 drive so we can explore the contents?

                              <span>Office 365 DOS Attack
 So this week we suddenly had a load of users who all needed their account unlocked. Upon investigation what had happened was we had external attempts of multiple logins to azure ad power shell that had failed and triggered the lockout policy.
 The attempts were clearly scripted as we had hundreds in a matter of seconds, all from different countries. The logins have since died down.
 I could find a conditional access policy to specifically block Azure AD power shell but found a post where you can block all apps then allow all the apps you use. This makes me nervous so currently have it in report only mode.
 This got me thinking how easy it would be for a malicious actor to do a DOS attack on a company which could cause a real outage and if there is a true way to protect against these attacks?
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a great opportunity to setup networking equipment for a small, gaming lounge. Current setup is using business ISP router/ap. 
 Budget: startup business, so $1000 USD range for initial install. 
 Devices: 3 Gaming PC&#x27;s (6 total in future) 3 Gaming Consoles (3+ more in future) 6+ smart TV&#x27;s (more in future) Security cameras 6-10 (currently none installed)
 Initial recommendation is ubiquiti (Dream machine pro, 48 port switch, AP&#x27;s, cameras)
 Want more recommendations - what&#x27;s your go to for this type of &quot;all in one&quot; appliances. There is no dedicated IT, possibly just me on weekends (lol).

                              <span>So we just moved into another building. I was supplied with the Static Frame-Route IP. I&#x27;m having trouble getting the Meraki online, it states ethernet connect to local network &quot;Static Frame-Route IP&quot;. However, I can&#x27;t connect to the Meraki dashboard. For now I will set that problem aside as I foresee a larger problem. We have another partner that has their own appliance and must be completely separate from us physically. Before we had a switch that would split that connection and let them pull down their public IP, the problem is I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s going to work in a leased line situation where they typically have a /32 for the PPPoE connection?

                              <span>Hello Net!
 ​
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted in on-prem DC?
 ​
 So, as we know, traffic in CDN networks is mostly outbound and the ratio can be 1:99, where only 1% are requests from the Internet to the CDN, and 99% are responses from the CDN to the Internet. On the one hand, we are obliged to use a firewall and requests from the Internet to the CDN service must pass through it. But should the return traffic go through the firewall? For example it might be possible that traffic from the Internet is only 1 Gbit/s, while outgoing traffic can reach hundreds of Gbit/s and it seems unreasonable to use firewall for outgoing traffic, because we trust our servers, plus we need a more expensive firewall. But on the other hand, if the return traffic won&#x27;t pass through the firewall, the routing setup will be a bit tricky, plus we&#x27;ll get asymmetric routing and so on...
 ​
 So, again:

 Since this is a isolated test box, I was hoping to use the loopback ip for my fqdn. I guess there is some external dns checks????
 I guess the question is how can I test without creating external dns records, etc.

 But the client wants the encrypt email functionality on their RDS server, where they all primarily work, working with the Outlook app directly. 
 Three different things occur depending upon how you click the Encrypt button in Outlook, when composing a new message:

 The core Network guy is too new and swamped with lots of work and I have a vendor which manages the firewalls but I need to get quickly across firewalls , site to site vpns , NAT in palos in that order and maybe some azure express routes too. 
 have the basic understanding but need to get a little deeper into it 
 Anyone here able to provide a 101 type video on the topic from say YouTube or tutorial/how to articles on the topic. Also there should be a trial Palo VE edition I could setup in my lab too am guessing. 
 Muchas Gracias!

                              <span>We are seeing an issue with client explorer.exe processes leaking handles on our SMB servers and causing them to be overrun.
 Within a few hours of opening a session in some cases we can see handle count for explorer.exe reaching 250,000+.
 Seeing it on mostly Windows 10 but also Server 2012 R2.
 When I run handle.exe tool it just has like 200,000 entries all in the root of the share and this is often without any applications running or files being opened (i.e. the share is just mapped/user has opened a connection to it at some point)
 Thought it might be AV or Windows Updates but have temporarily disabled AV and installed latest patches but problem still occurs.
 Not sure how to investigate why explorer is just continuously opening these handles and then proceeding to not close them/letting them just pile up. Thought it was a server issue but this is happening across multiple different SMB servers/independent storage systems.

                              <span>Today I upgraded a JIRA app called BigPicture on our productive environment. I&#x27;m not a professional JIRA admin, but I do 1st and 2nd Level Support aside from my main tasks.
 The company paid around 6500 $ for the license for that app.
 By default, the app creates a database dump whenever you upgrade it.
 Cool, I thought. Upgraded it with few clicks. Closed the ticket – went on with my day thinking that it worked out fine. Nope. I received an E-Mail that the entire configuration from the users was gone.
 I looked into it and, yes, all the things that they were working on were gone. Communicated the situation to my other admin colleague and to the key users. Then I tried restoring the data from the database dump. This did not work because the database scheme has been upgraded as well, and we would have to revert the app to the older version to make the restore file compatible.
 So, I went into test environment, downloaded the older version of said app, installed it, but no. It did not downgrade. Apparently you&#x27;d have to uninstall the app first and then reinstall the older version. Sure thing, so I did just that (on the test environment) and tried to restore the backup there. Failed. Nothing happened when I click on the button to restore the data. And I also cannot restore the data on the test environment as the database dump only applies to the prod environment (due to the upgrade).
 Note that this is not the first time that this happened. We&#x27;ve had the same issue with this app around 1 month ago, where I created a ticket. Apparently it was a bug, which then got hotfixed. (We even tested it and it worked). But now we are back to where we&#x27;ve been in the beginning. I reopened the ticket, and I&#x27;m still waiting for feedback.
 Got a message that this issue has been perceived very negatively, and I understand. Now they want me to get the app working ASAP or I might get fired, but there&#x27;s not much I can do.
 Yikes.

 Some good tool for keeping track of everything i have my pipeline as i tend to be unorganized and forgetful unless I have good documentation. 
 This is purley for personal use to gain an upper edge in my role as infrastructure/application manager. 
 I don&#x27;t mind having to host and /or set ut a lot of it on my own part. I find that enjoyable.

 WIll be greatful for all suggestions, just started looking into it, but I thought i would throw out the question to see if anyone had some suggestions on the top of their mid.

                              <span>How do you all name your domain (cloud or prem) PCs? 
 I use asset tags and am considering just naming computers by serial. I wholly manage a hybrid Azure enviro w/2k machines and 45 servers and I’m tired of buying asset tags only to deal with them being peeled off or falling off. 
 My asset system is easy to manage and assign to users/facilities via asset tags, but it’s all the same to me how they’re named since I can find them and their primary users through many pipelines. 
 Hybrid Azure w/SCCM co-manage, all windows workstations, servers are all on ESXi hosts. Hosts, arrays, and network switches have the same asset identity schema.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Earlier this year I shared an OpenSSL cheat sheet and it seems to have been received well by this community. I&#x27;ve made a few typo corrections and wanted to share the latest version.
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; OpenSSL Cheat Sheet v1.7 Direct Download &lt;&#x3D;&#x3D;
 The cheat sheet includes these commands and various flags/arguments and notes for how to use them:
  
openssl rsa
 openssl genrsa
 openssl dsa
 openssl gendsa
 openssl dsaparam
 openssl ec
 openssl ecparam
 openssl pkey
 openssl genpkey
 openssl x509
 openssl req
 openssl pkcs12
  
The most up to date version of this cheat sheet will always be available at pracnet.net/openssl, at the moment that is v1.7, so feel free to use the direct download link above. (no registration or e-mail sign ups required)
 The cheat sheet is a part of a course I teach on OpenSSL, and if you use OpenSSL for troubleshooting and inspecting SSL/TLS, you might want to consider the whole course. Since it&#x27;s coming up on sale season I figured I&#x27;d also throw in 1000 free seats to the course on Udemy:
 Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/openssl-cheatsheet/?couponCode&#x3D;B7B7EEF874F9D43D1AB5
 Udemy Code: B7B7EEF874F9D43D1AB5

                              <span>Until recently we had users running RDP sessions on a Windows 2012r2 server, and were able to shadow their sessions without issues.
 We now run Windows server 2022 RDS session host, and shadowing shows black screen with only user mouse showing. I understand this problem started with server 2016. Any suggestions as to what can be done on the server-side to fix this issue?

                              <span>Evening fellow SysAdmins. We have been a long time GWorkspace customer and have been pretty happy overall. We now have to begin expanding our email retention and archiving requirements. Google has Vault with unlimited space and retrieval options for an add on. I&#x27;ve read pros/cons using Vault, compared to another 3rd party service, especially in how it performs and for lack of some features. It seems so much easier to get Vault and administer from the same &quot;Dashboard&quot; though rather than another service pooling all our email and using a side vendor. I was hoping follow members, either uses a service that works with Gmail very well, or their direct Vault product and what their take is on it. Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I don’t know how others feel about this but I have gotten to the point that I get pissed off when friends or acquaintances ask me for IT help. I don’t want to do IT when I’m off the clock from my job. I feel like we work in one of the few professions in which people think they can just reach out to us for a free fix. I don’t ask people for free haircuts or to come clean my house for free. Why do they think they can just call or text me with their IT problem and expect me to give them an answer? I paid money and spent a lot of time to get my certs and education. My solution to this has been to tell people, “sure, I can take a look at that. My diagnosis fee is $50. I can’t guarantee I can fix it but I will take a look and we can go from there.” I actually just got my first client like this. It was meant as more of a deterrent but I got a client. Lol. Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to see what others think.

                              <span>A little background I&#x27;m in my mid 30s had a pretty bad burnout and am now in a 6 month IT course (IT security).
 I&#x27;m pretty much ahead of my class due to having been an IT nerd all my life.
 My question is, do managers/companies/colleagues care more about your knowledge or your ability to get stuff up and running.
 Tldr: Should i focus my spare time during these classes on focusing on theoretical information or actually do stuff and get it running.
 For eg we have a little project where we have to setup an AD environment. It&#x27;s really basic so for fun Ive virtualized everything in proxmox, got a virtual opnsense router in there, adding a backup and monitoring server, looking to get it liked to azure somehow ...

They continue on (in the ticket) to say that they have already requested access to this site, months ago, and nobody helped them. In today&#x27;s ticket, they did not include the domain they needed access to.
 I looked at the ticket history and sure enough, they did submit a ticket months ago. That ticket did include a domain and at that time the tech notes on the ticket were.
  
The domain resolves and opens on a few computers that I&#x27;ve confirmed access on. Please confirm that you&#x27;ve typed the domain name/website name properly. I am keeping the ticket open for a few days, please let me know when you are available to perform further testing from your machine/location.
  
The status on the ticket was changed to &#x27;waiting for user response&#x27;, which keeps the ticket open and informs the user at least once a day that a ticket requires their attention. It does this for 5 business days then closes the ticket if there is no reply from the user or if the tech doesn&#x27;t modify the ticket in some other way.
 The user ignored the notes from the first ticket that &#x27;they put in months ago&#x27; and I&#x27;m sure this user is bad mouthing IT. &#x27;I can&#x27;t get to this site, this is dumb, I already put in a ticket, they never help me!!!&#x27;

                              <span>I have our domain controller set to sync from 1.us.pool.ntp.org, which is working, and all member servers seem to sync to the domain controller when I run w32tm /query /status. Yet I&#x27;ve noticed several NTP errors in event logs starting on the 15th for time.windows.com. Apparently the backup NTP peer after the domain controller is time.windows.com, and when I run w32tm /stripchart /computer:time.windows.com /dataonly /samples:10 I notice that it&#x27;s erroring out a lot (70% error rate). Anyone else?

 I moved and have worked for a private company for a year and I am still shocked by how different things are, lack of documentation, lack of planning, lack of contracts etc etc
 At the factory there seems to be so many production stops due to ancient hardware, and sadly we in IT are involved too because some of that hardware, e.g. weights are connected to servers and computers too. At a meeting where we were in…</span>

 example.com is the public domain, ad.example.com is the internal-only domain. Lookups to records under ad.example.com will succeed against the internal Samba domain controllers will succeed but will fail against public DNS servers.
 As we can see, a lookup for rt.example.com returns the CNAME, but then doesn&#x27;t &quot;follow up&quot; to get the IP address, even though a lookup for rt73a.ad.example.com returns the IP address.
 The context is that I currently don&#x27;t want rt.example.com to be accessible over the internet but I might want that in future. Was hoping to be able to that without requiring a change of URL used to access it.
 Is DNS supposed to behave how it&#x27;s behaving for me, or is there some setting I need to change to get the behaviour I want?

Just thought I&#x27;d make a new post to see if the update DID resolve the Kerberos issues for anyone that rolled the update out and removed their original registry edits. Us gunshy sysadmins with no test environment thank you regardless.

                              <span>We are replacing the old DCs in our organisation for cyber security which has made us create new print servers. All the printers are installed and work from the servers in the configuration we want, using dns for port names etc.
 Now because of print nightmare we are trying a work around to install the printer drivers via intune and then a login script to map the printers after the drivers are installed.
 Here comes the issue, we have noticed that all of the printers with v4 drivers are being installed with MS point and print driver. The printer with v3 drivers are installing with their appropriate drivers.
 We have found that some of the V4 drivers are not installing, so adding that to the driver install script, removing and re-running the login mapping script, it still adds the printers with point and print. 2 of these are for the main office and need user preferences enabled so they can select trays etc. But point and print doesn&#x27;t enable that. Without that we cannot shut off the old DCs.
 Now we don&#x27;t want to disable the print nightmare registry key or amend it to a state where it is not 1 as this will be picked up in the cyber security audit in March 2023. I am at a loss as to what I can do to bypass this issue. It seems odd that all websites on the Internet state V4 is the answer to fixing it but V4 is causing the problem.
 At the moment we cannot move to a driverless system as we need to get new printer contracts first.
 TLDR; printers with V4 drivers are shown installed with point and print and is not suitable for our environment.

                              <span>I am in IT for a Navy Organization and we currently use AppLocker in our environment. AppLocker is set to block anything to do with OneDrive, however it keeps getting reinstalled during every monthly patch. As far as I know, its not a requirement for any other apps and we have already been blocking it for a few month. 
 What this ends up doing is making is users constantly see &quot;blocked by admin&quot; and error messages. This does not effect functionality but it causes an uproar from users.
 My suggested solution is to disable OneDrive usage via Group policy but actually &quot;allow OneDrive&quot; via AppLocker to prevent these messages. 
 Is there anything Security/STIG related that makes my idea sound like a bad one? For reference this is the policy I want to enable.

 Any and all input would be great regarding your organization, file storage, or just security guidelines in general. I do have the OneDrive V2R2 STIGS as well. But I wasn&#x27;t sure if there are any other overarching guidelines I am missing out on.

                              <span>I have a few servers (2016 and 2019) that the start menu doesn&#x27;t work on.
 If I run:
  
Get-appxpackage -all shellexperience -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
  
The start menu will work after reboot until you log off and log back on. 
 I have tried running various powershell commands to uninstall then reinstall appx packages, copying over the SystemApps folder from a working server, deleting the shell experience folder from appdata for all users, exporting appx registry keys from a working server, and deleting and recreating profiles.
 The only thing that works is the command listed above, and that&#x27;s only temporary. 
 I&#x27;d appreciate any ideas on this one, I think I&#x27;ve exhausted google.

 We notice that when phishing emails do slip through Mimecast’s net, in some cases these are categorising as phishing by Microsoft Defender.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 One of my clients has an old infrastructure (Server 2012) and they want to go serverless (AADJ + Intune) as much as possible and migrate most of his data into SharePoint but there are SolidWorks files that still need to stay on-prem and I am wondering if need to keep the file server and upgrade it?
 If a windows server is still required for SolidWorks, I also need a dc for authentication, right? I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep the DC...Do you guys have any tips or recommendation for that kind of scenario?
 Thank you very much for the help !

 Possible update culprit? Both installed 14/11/22

 or
 Security KB5019980

 PS: Currently testing by removing the security KB5019980 but have had no results thus far.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m not versed in the ways of the sysadmin but i have to work with daily users fixing little and larger stuff (Helpdesk).
 I like my job but i don&#x27;t know what to do anymore for a specific individual. 
 This person is paranoid, delusional and thinks the entire world is following her and changing stuff behind her back.
 It started years ago, she claimed her skype account got hacked multiple times, she couldn&#x27;t reset the password since she never got the reset mails.
 Turns out her recovery address was a gmail address and she never cleaned that up so the mailbox was full.
 She doesn&#x27;t want to clean it up so she can never reset any service she claims has been blocked or hacked that is connected to her gmail address.
 This person does not accept nor want to hear any rational explanation.
 She claims all her phones, laptops (private and work) are being monitored and things &quot;change&quot; the next time she logs on to any device.
 For years we ran scans with antivirus, antimalwares etc ... nothing is ever found except some harmless cookies.
 We can never verify if anything she claims is true since the &quot;present situation&quot; cannot be compared to the &quot;previous situation&quot; since all files are always locally on her laptop or at home or anywhere else where we have no backups.
 Finally we got her to place some documents on our internal network drives with the specific question to only follow what happens to these files while she works on them. (She really didn&#x27;t want to put them on the network) This way at least i can look into the backups to see what has changed. But even that doesn&#x27;t prove anything.
 What would you do so you could &quot;prove&quot; that either she changed something or at least see what changed and by whom ?
 This person can tie you up for hours and days complaining we don&#x27;t do enough to find the culprit on her work pc and i don&#x27;t know anymore what i could do to help her.

 Cheers,

                              <span>Hi All
 Further to my post about using Azure/365 non licensed users. I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.
 A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.
 Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).
 I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at other threads on here about other VPN hardware providers and I&#x27;ve heard a general concensus of Cisco anyconnect and Palo&#x27;s global protect. As being great options 
 There&#x27;s only a few concerns/requirements I&#x27;m looking for.
  
Pre-windows login auth to domain servers for new user authentication
 Saved credentials that can be used with said pre-windows login
 And multiple gateway options for fail over to redundant ISPs
  
For requirement #1,2 we have a few branch offices with a decent amount of turn over so new users are always signing in and out of the domain&#x27;d pc so a saved set of VPN credentials that user&#x27;s can&#x27;t see and don&#x27;t need to be reentered for an employee to authenticate to the DC to is a must
 We currently use Watchguard fireboxes with IPsec clients as they allow prelogin auth with saved creditials, but my only gripe is that the VPN client doesn&#x27;t allow for multiple gateway options with out making a new profile, that users have to swap to and sign in again on. (The VPN client has to swap gateways on its own as I don&#x27;t trust my users to toggle to the back up, and to toggle back to the primary when connection is stable again.) 
 I&#x27;m hesitant at the Cisco option as I don&#x27;t have much Cisco CLI expertise.
 We have about 25-35 VPN endpoints at any given time. 
 We are a full windows org and only IT uses VPN on phones (mainly to just test if the VPN connection is working)

                              <span>We have for some time been installing printers by hand because drivers would require admin permissions to install the printer drivers.
 Today we updated all of our Konica Minolta print drivers to v4 and non-admin users can install printers without admin permissions.
 Is it really this simple?! We have been fighting with this issue since PrintNightmare hit last year.

                              <span>Task &#x3D; migrate all users (8000+) homedrive data to onedrive but replicate the myDocuments structure(home drives vary from 1gb up to 30gb) 
 I have found that i need to identify and exclude any onedrive shortcuts in all users onedrives as well as:
 1 prevent them being moved via robocopy (we are lifting and shifting all onedrive content into a &quot;documents&quot; folder for each user)
 2 prevent any files being moved from users homedrives going in to any onedrive shortcuts folders, this is to prevent personal files being uploaded to SP or a Teams SP site. (Happened in testing...)
 Currently I have a robocopy to do a move (it&#x27;s more complex than this example) :
 Onedrive root -&gt; Onedrive\Documents Hdrive -&gt; onedrive\Documents
 Issue being folders are merged and onedrive shortcuts will upload content to whatever sites they are part of.
 This is a task set out as we can not use the provided onedrive migration tools due to some clash with known folder redirection and pther issues that i wasnt part of initially. 
 Any ideas? Or am I over complicating things.
 I have created a complicated powershell script so far that does alot of prechecks (network,diskspace,homedrive space required, etc) but this actual lift and shift part just gets more complicated when I look into the nitty grity bits.

                              <span>Hi, i’m an italian IT admin for some different companies, i started my business 1 year ago and i have 5 year of experience in the IT administration field (i started almost from zero and during my engineer graduation i worked a lot in this field). Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider. Thanks in advice

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m newbie with windows server. 
 When we install the printer in the server, it does not auto install on computers inside the domain. 
 I created a policy which is called Print Nightmare, but it did not work and I needed to seach it by myself. 
 Other problem that happened is that if I installed the printer first in one user the error 0x000002e4 comes up, but if I login with Admin and install it, and then login with the user and install it, there is no error. 
 Is anyway that I can install in the server and automaticly the printer shows up by itself ? 
 I do not know if I explained it well.

 Newly promoted sysadmin here, previously lower IT-manager with background in programming, and the only IT-guy for the company.. I&#x27;ve been tasked with coming up with a redundant solution for our internet-connection.

 But, it&#x27;s not working after I follow perfectly, still, I can create new passwords randomly for new users. What can be the issue here? Does ec2 really allow to implement of this on the os level?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I want to test my Samsung SATA drives since some of them cause trouble when recording large video files over time, causing drop frames. Seems to be due to the SSD not being able to keep up the pace. I know the usual suspects like Samsung Macigian, Crystal Disk, Smartmontools, etc. 
 But it seems none of them gives me a comfortable way of dealing with slowly degrading disks of different types and vendors. Do I really have to go into the specific SMART attributes and check on the significance of each one of them, also having to monitor them changing over time? 
 For ex. my not so good old 840 Pro (256GB) passes all tests and currently gives me 56 CRC errors and 5216 wear leveling count. I also suspect that any kind of bad sector checks also don&#x27;t really work with SSDs as they trim the bad cells away!?

                              <span>I mean, I truly feel bad for the engineers and other employees caught in the crossfire but I can&#x27;t stop myself from enjoying the emerging clusterfuck. But I&#x27;m fairly certain they&#x27;ll land on their feet and have multiple offers already. 
 I&#x27;m also not really an Elon hater but seeing him disregard his employees after the take over (firing indescriminately, forcing long hours, reverting work from home and now that ultimatum his mailed out) I can&#x27;t help but smile a little with the chaos that&#x27;s ensuing. It reminds me of all the bullshit finance, HR and sales have put us through in past projects without repercussions.

                              <span>Hello. I’m looking to figure out an oversubscription model for our WAN locations. We have many branch locations that are fed by MPLS services with no current option to add local internet access. Our wireless is centralized and we have no appetite at this time to change to flex-connect. 
 So, knowing this, I’ve landed on a minimum bandwidth of approx 3.5Mbps per client. I haven’t nailed down the amount of clients yet but I have a method to figure that out. What I’m struggling with is how much oversubscription to go with. 2:1, 5:1, 20:1? Or any other insights you may have. This is a healthcare environment, so a large portion of our guests are transitory, but while they’re here we want a good experience. 
 Thoughts? Totally to open to suggestions. 
 Edit: sorry for spelling, grammar. Mobile sucks. :)

                              <span>Hi all!
 it is some kind of a theoretical unequal-cost load-balancing question.
 Let&#x27;s imagine that we have two parallel connections between two routers 400M and 700M, or any unequal M:N ratio.
 What we have now for load both connections M:N ratio (let&#x27;s forget about Mice and Elephant flows).
 E.g. if we have Cisco from both sides - we have an proprietary EIGRP for this, which does an excellent job with this.
 So question - what if we have two different vendors on different sides (or one non-Cisco)? 
 What options do we have? BGP + DMZ Bandwidth Community? Static M:N routes? Do we have another non-Cisco proprietary solution for this?
 Is there anything else?
 I will be glad for detailed answers with explanations, Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Good afternoon,
 I work Helpdesk for a printer company and had an interesting situation that seems to be network related.
 The printer had a static IP, .0.24. I enabled DHCP, rebooted and it grabbed a 0.250 address (no APIPA). Also confirmed they were on the same Wi-Fi as the computer. The IP would not respond to pings and the UI was not reachable but the IP could be seen in an arp -a command. The MAC matched the printer. Typically, if you cannot ping it’s either on a different network or offline completely, and with this being visible in arp, a good Wi-Fi connection status and the printer rebooted, the only thing I could think would be to reboot the router. Any thoughts on what could cause this?
 Thanks very much!

 You&#x27;ll need the provisioning info from RingCentral. I found it under Phone System, Phones &amp; Devices, User Phones. Clicked one of the devices, clicked Set Up and Provision, then clicked Set up manually using SIP. Pick the correct outbound proxy based on your location.
 At this point, you need to decide whether to use TLS or not. It&#x27;s your choice but I recommend using it. The instructions below work for both. Copy all the information down because it contains information you&#x27;ll use below.

This assumes you have a fresh device without any existing config
 I installed the latest firmware which at the time is 6.60A.367.001
 Do the normal stuff to add IP&#x27;s, DNS, NTP, etc.
 If you&#x27;re using TLS then you need to upload the root certificates. They can…</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m a SrNE for a global biotech company and we&#x27;ve been running approximately ~2k+ C9300s spanning the globe for a few years now. Over the last 3 months we&#x27;ve been experiencing complete failures at a very alarming rate. We&#x27;re currently running IOS-XE v17.3.5.
 Switch failures have occurred for various reasons, entailing:
 - PoE capability of switch death (Non PSU related).
 - Switches experiencing faulty boot flash requiring more RMAs.
 - Switches randomly bricking with no lights whatsoever. Just a complete and total death.
 - Switches randomly bricking and giving &quot;BOOT FAIL W&quot; error on console and non-recoverable. Can&#x27;t even access ROMMON. Validated via Cisco bugID CSCwb57624, but not recoverable via power cycle/reload as noted in Workaround: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb57624
 Further, after our team pushed Cisco to how unacceptable this has been, they came back acknowledging a potentially faulty batch of many of our C9300s with corrupted DIMM.
 Guys... In my 15+ years of networking and having managed C3750/3850s for the majority of my career, I&#x27;ve never experienced or witnessed anything like this from Cisco.
 For years now, I haven&#x27;t been fond of the direction Cisco has taken their Catalyst platform with moves like axing Catalyst IOS, consolidating IOS-XE to catalyst hardware, and their continued merakification of Catalyst which lacks the tight integration needed for rock-solid stability (IMO). 
 Cisco&#x27;s moves have mostly felt more like cost-cutting measures than anything truly beneficial or innovative from an engineering standpoint. It&#x27;s all giving me FirePower vibes which is why Palo is now dominating that market-space.
 Anyone else running C9300s in their environment at scale?
 Any failures?
 What software chain?
 I can&#x27;t imagine our org is the only one experiencing this.

                              <span>When adding VLAN to switches, do you have to provide an IP address for the VLAN? Or is that only if you need to access the switch over that IP?
 ​
 In other words, can you just add the VLAN and assign the ports without assigning an IP? 
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We are currently using a NAC product that&#x27;s pretty expensive. We are using it to dynamic tag VLANs based on Active Directory OU. So, if the user is in the &quot;Monkeys&quot; OU they get assigned to the &quot;Monkeys&quot; VLAN.
 Can this be done with something like NPS or FreeRadius? I&#x27;ve been checking documentation and I&#x27;m getting mixed signals on how easy this would be to configure with FreeRadius (seems like it doesn&#x27;t play well with AD, requires Samba, etc.) and I have no experience with NPS, but the documentation seems pretty straightforward.
 Any recommendations on how to dynamically wireless users to specific VLANs via AD group/OU without paying out the ass for a NAC?

                              <span>Quick background first - Got about 10 years of professional networking experience but I have NEVER touched proper enterprise grade cisco equipment. EVER. Mostly worked in places that couldn&#x27;t afford or didn&#x27;t need all those features and a new ISP that did a Juniper/Calix combo. FINALLY started working for an employer that has the scratch for Cisco with Palo Alto for Firewall.
 TL;DR: I&#x27;m very green on what Cisco hardware can and cannot do.
 We are getting tasked with stopping users from being able to communicate directly with each other within their same subnets. They only need to communicate with specific servers and cloud services.
 With Calix, I was able to use a protocol called Mac Forced Forwarding (MFF). In conjunction with DHCP Snooping and IP Source Verification, the switches forced all traffic to the gateway where a host was assigned via DHCP. My original thought was to use this and have the PaloAlto&#x27;s regulate this traffic. Well to my surprise, these catalyst switches (9200, 9300 and 2960) do not have this feature. Seems to be limited to ISP grade switches.
 I tried using Switchport Protection (Private VLAN Edge) and this worked when the workstation where on the same switch. But it allows me to communicate to other workstations on other switches. While all of my access switches do trunk back 1-to-1 to the core switches. If I put those switch&#x27;s uplinks into protected status as well, I might get what I need. Still &quot;testing&quot; this out. 
 I&#x27;m also looking at VACLs but I haven&#x27;t fully grasped the cisco mapping features yet.
 Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to tackle this requirement?

                              <span>I have what I thought is a simple problem but the way the documentation discusses this is confusing to me.
 Setup
 Firewall &gt;&gt; 1820-8g &gt;&gt; WiFi AP
 My WiFi AP has 2 SSID (VLAN 1 and VLAN 1003). All I want to do is be able to pass through both on one port to firewall but all tagged traffic is currently blocked.
 I think what I need to do is set all ports as Untagged for VLAN ID 1 and Tagged for VLAN ID 1003? This seems weird since I don&#x27;t want to &quot;tag&quot; incoming traffic I just want it to pass through if already tagged. Is my understanding correct or should both VLAN ID be shown as Tagged?

                              <span>I have inherited a network where we have a single peering with an ISP using a private AS on our side. We advertise a single prefix (which we own) to them which they then advertise to the internet on our behalf.
 In RIPE, there is an empty ROA configuration where it shows the current AS numbers advertising the prefix (i.e. the ISPs AS) and we can just pick one and click to create an ROA to match. Private AS numbers do not show up here and cannot be configured as origins.
 I recently added an ROA to try and reduce the risk of a BGP hijack of our prefix. Shortly after creating the ROA, the ISP stopped accepting our prefix and of course it dropped off the internet. The ISP wasn&#x27;t able to give much information as to why this happened but by removing the ROA, it came back up soon after.
 I&#x27;m assuming what happened is, the ISP had a filter on their router which looked up the ROA for our advertised prefix, saw it originating from a private AS which didn&#x27;t match the ROA and then dropped it. Would that be normal behavior for an ISP? Would they not trust the private AS as they were the ones who provided it to us in the first place?
 Or is using an ROA just not possible where the originating AS is a private one?
 We do have a public AS that was recently assigned but have not started using it just yet.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and a lot of times when we are spinning up a new site, ISPs will provide a /30 for the WAN and then a LAN subnet (usually /27 or something similar) for public IPs to be assigned. Is there a reasoning for this rather than just including the ISP gateway in the provided public IPs? We usually have a firewall at the edge but when provided with this ISP set up, we have to use a router to bridge the WAN and LAN. Just wondering if there is any reason behind this configuration?

 Anyways, I am looking a for a book that&#x27;s basically self contained/will give me enough information that I can read it and say &quot;ok, I know how this works and can sort of make a mental model of it in my head.&quot; I tend to read books cover to cover/work through as many problems as I can along the way.Ideally I&#x27;ll only need one book.
 Current recommendations/on my list are
 - Comer, Internetworking
 - Tannenbaum&#x27;s Networking textbook - Networking a top down approach
 Thanks in advance for your advice

 Was wondering if anyone on this forum could shed a light on a strange issue I&#x27;m seeing on a network. 
 I have a VRF (all configured correctly as reachability to other subnet across the MPLS are reachable fine) presented on a port facing a host (windows laptop) the IP facing this host is:
 192.168.0.1/24 
 The host laptop is on:
 192.168.0.2/24
 I can ping the laptop fine sourcing the gateway interface on the router and the host can ping the gateway, however it is unable to ping other hosts inside the VRF on other sites (the laptop can ping the gateway to these other sites just nothing sat behind the gateway). 
 To remove any possibility of it being an MPLS issue I created a loopback interface on the router where the above 192.168.0.0/24 subnet sits: 
 Loopback100
 10.10.10.10/32 
 I still cannot ping the host 192.168.0.5 sourcing this loopback. I instantly assumed the host default gateway was wrong as I could ping directly connected but no further, however the hosts address/subnet mask and default gateway are 100% correct.
 ​
 Was wondering if anyone had a similar issue, the router is question is a Cisco ISR 1100.

                              <span>Hey!
 I am working as an MSP for Small Businesses (&lt;10 employees). None of our Customers have Services that are available through port forwarding nor do they use VPN connections. They have a proper professional Endpoint Security Solution (with Firewall) installed on every device.
 Now to my question: Does it make sense to deploy a &quot;Next-Gen Firewall&quot; into their network? I don&#x27;t really see any benefit they would get out of an expensive Firewall compared to say a small MikroTik Router doing NAT (properly configured of course, VLANS etc.) . I heard that all those fancy things like Deep Packet inspection come with their own Downsides that i would rather not deal with. (And my Endpoint Security Solution supposedly does the same thing but right on every device with little to no configuration)
 Do you think the added Security weighs out the cost of buying, monitoring and maintaining a Firewall for such a business?
 I personally would think the money is better spent on awareness trainings for the employees than on such a device. 
 What are your thoughts?

 Is there a tool or technique that can tell you if a wifi network is under- or over-utilized?

                              <span>Hi, as the question states, does anyone know if Teams tags it traffic with the correct QoS tags before it reaches the network port or access point?
 If not then does anyone have any suggestions how to identify the traffic across a multi vender OS estate? I would&#x27;ve considered a GPO to tag it with the correct tag if it was an all Windows estate but since MAC and Android are involved to, I was hoping Teams already pre tagged in traffic.
 We use Meraki MR46 access points and there is no option to build a custom rule based on source ip address annoyingly to as I know Teams has a predefined source port range it uses across the board
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking at implementing wireless QOS across our wireless estate.
 With this mainly comes the need to prioritise Microsoft Teams traffic over anything else first and foremost.
 I have read a few Meraki and 3rd party posts/blogs on setting it up with no real answer to this question...
 Do the default rules (or custom ones for that matter) shape traffic themselves on the AP&#x27;s or are they only a means of tagging certain traffic with the correct QoS tag?
 The reason I think the AP&#x27;s might arrange traffic and shape it themselves is because the option to &quot;Shape this traffic&quot; is there on the default and custom rules to.
 I haven&#x27;t really been able to find an answer to this.
 Our link speed bandwidth across this new site we are building is more than enough! But since there are going to be a lot of people wirelessly &quot;hot desking&quot;, wireless will be even more prioritised than wired. With that comes a need to make sure all the AP&#x27;s prioritise traffic such as Teams (mainly) etc... over others like YouTube etc... 
 If the default rules do shape traffic on the AP&#x27;s into low/high priority queues behind the scenes then they will be enough for what I&#x27;m looking for here given that the default tags from Meraki seem to be correct across the board for things like VOIP and Teams etc...

While I do have some good experience, I don’t feel confident in my current skills. Have any of you guys gone through this phase before? Any tips that you might want to share? Thanks!

                              <span>Anyone else or just me? The amount of trouble and drama that these cause me is unreal at times. Absolutely hate the things!
 In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!
 We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4&#x27;s, 220Xi4&#x27;s, ZD500&#x27;s and ZT610&#x27;s. 
 A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn&#x27;t being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. 
 So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don&#x27;t really want to know. I&#x27;d sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!
 Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I&#x27;m an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn&#x27;t half stress me out when these things go down.
 It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result. I also find printers the most mundane sort of things to be dealing with which I suppose doesn&#x27;t help!

                              <span>Like the question stated in the subject, who&#x27;s job is it to retrieve company equipment from terminated employees in the remote workforce? My HR Dept is tasking me with reaching out to the termed employee and coordinating the return of equipment. I dont feel like it should be IT&#x27;s responsibility. I do believe that I should provide the list of equipment but not be the means of recovering it. I am curious on everyone&#x27;s thoughts and what procedures you all might have in place for this.
 Edit: I would like to thank everyone for your feedback. A little more background here, small IT Dept, I am a lone Sysadmin with one tech support rep. We have a company of about 225 employees and I report directly to the COO. I posted here because I keep getting put in situations of having to deal first hand with termed employees. And of recent I was put in a situation to meet up with a termed employee at our offices on a Saturday when no one is there. I have drawn the line here and documented my concerns in an email to HR and management. Thanks for the reassurance that I am making the right decision here stepping up to management.

 Working with an internal Tier 1, needing to call an SaaS vendor tier 1.
 I don&#x27;t know how you (internal/external) deal with us idiots.
 I just know the good/excellent tier one are easy to recognize... they quickly move up, and I miss them immediately.
 Note: I work for a large University/Hospital. YMMV.

In a snubbing fashion he mentioned Bitlocker since its the only encryption that can be used on Windows laptops. Am I wrong for thinking there are alternatives? I remember years ago there were.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and I am fairly new to my role. I have a head on my shoulders to not do something like this.
 A client has a server that was setup about a year ago. I was working on the server recently to install a TPM chip to have BitLocker setup and come to my surprise; I didn&#x27;t see a RAID controller; and then I went into Disk Management and confirmed my suspicion. 
 Disk 1: 500 GB: for OS
 Disk 2: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 3: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 4: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 5: 2TB Unused (Empty) 
 https://imgur.com/a/Y46NSS7
 Server is PowerEdge R540 128 GB Memory / Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz 
 Client has about 7 VMs being ran on this span of 3 hard drives. Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn&#x27;t know this yet. 
 I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?
 Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well. I was thinking of doing a RAID 1 for that.
 How would you go through and handle this issue and prevent as minimum downtime as possible to get this s*** fixed?

                              <span>I would love to throw myself into say a 6-month contract, fully commit to it, do the best job I can, learn as much as I can, save up as much as I can. And then when it&#x27;s finished take 2-3 months off to travel and such. Rinse and repeat.
 Is this viable? Or would it be seen in a negative light by employers, having all these &quot;career breaks&quot;? The way some people make it sound is if there is a 1-month gap in your resume, questions start being asked. 
 I appreciate any feedback! I feel like I need a change from the normal work lifestyle of indefinite mon-fri 10 hour days for the next 30 years until I retire. Contracting seems like it could be a good way to keep things fresh, experience different infrastructures and learn new skills. And generally seems to be better pay, I&#x27;d likely earn the same if not more even with the time off.

 Currently we don&#x27;t and I have no problem with it, but my boss is annoyed some people ask for headset when they might have had one already.
 My thought is maybe some kind of Microsoft form and some how targeting new hires with it.

There are plans to remove this server. I am looking over the autodiscover settings in users outlook to troubleshoot disappearing shared mailboxes. 
 After Reading microsoft&#x27;s documentation, i&#x27;m a little lost.

So, everything is saying I will find a redirect to a redirect xml. I am seeing a list of words with the names of the discovery items and 0 as the dword value. The list contains autodiscover-s.outlook.com, and our owa, which isn&#x27;t reachable at the time. This is the first time I have seen -s. My DNS is a CName: Audotdiscover that leads to autodiscover.outlook.com. 
 How do I change these settings globally? Should I change this? Is this even a problem? Do you have additional resources/information? I know OWA is unreachable, and that might be causing some of this problem. 
 Thank you for any information you can help with.

In any case (ignoring the previous post please) what advice would you have for a mid level Sysadmin hoping to progress to be an IT manager.
 How many years experience should one have, how many certs one should study IF they are necessary.

I also want to make SSO work seamless from domain joined workstations from the Desktop apps (Outlook, OneDrive) and from browsers.
 So far I believe I need to configure password hash synchronization and then also Azure AD Seamless SSO? Is there a minimal level of M365 license required for this? Any lesson learned? Thanks.

                              <span>This could be a fun one for me. So I have an engineer working in a closed network environment with hardware. He&#x27;s currently using socat to connect COMM/Serial ports from his hardware into his system over PCI. His system runs some specialized software that re-packages information and the goal is to pipe it out to another system that&#x27;s expecting the traffic to come from a modem interface.
 There&#x27;s a few different types of modem emulation software I see on the web, but does anyone have any input or experience using them?

                              <span>My place of employment uses IE compatibility mode in Edge for dozens of sites. New info had just been updated on November 8th. Its hard to tell from the FAQ but does anybody if this will remove enough of IE that it will break IE compatibility mode in Edge permanently?
 &quot; Note: The retired, out-of-support Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be permanently disabled on certain versions of Windows 10 as part of the February 2023 Windows security update (&quot;B&quot; release) scheduled for February 14, 2023. &quot;

                              <span>Made a script that basically locks down DCU, updates on a schedule, and applies a BIOS password to both the BIOS and DCU. It also hides all notifications and does not auto-reboot or prompt for it.
 We have all Dells and some desperately needed updates, this script does that and even changes the bios password if a existing one is already applied. Obviously this can all be changed to fit your needs.
 The regkey adds and take aways in the scripts are because that how we know if something is install or found in intune.
 This also takes away Dell bloatware. All in all im proud of it, took a while to fine tune it but it can always be improved. Just thought Id share.
 There is a Install, Uninstall, and detection script so it wont install on machines that arent Dells.

 My situation is grim to say the least, new to IT my site lead just left, only 5 months of experience and I had to migrate the COO&#x27;s computer to another one. Made a BitLocker though means of USB and thought I saved the recovery key but I did not. I saved the recovery key instead, Is there anyway to work around this? the COO will not be back in office to get his USB till Monday.

 We are trying to use the command prompt net group from a local login on a workstation.. This workstation is on the domain, but I&#x27;m logging in as the local user: .\localuser and not the domain\user.
 Command prompt code below: net group MYDOMAINGROUP /domain
 I can&#x27;t get the command prompt above to run on the .\localuser, but I can get it to run on the Domain\User. How can I get this to work on the .\localuser?
 The image below is a screenshot and results from the command prompt. The left command prompt is run as a domain user. the command prompt on the right is run as a local user. The local user is getting an System error 5 occurred Access is denied.. Does anyone know of any group policy objects or ways to get a local user to successfully request information from the domain controller? example

                              <span>Hi, we have an old unsupported application on our system, it has been decided that this needs to be isolated from the rest of the network due to it no longer receiving security updates.
 This application consists of a database which resides on a Win 2019 Std server with an associated service which facilitates client&#x27;s access to said database. Users have a client application which is installed on their Win 10 Pro machines which is used to access the database residing on the server.
 Both the server-side application and the client-side application would need to be isolated.
 Does anyone know of a solution I could use to facilitate this?

                              <span>Not too long ago, the email server market was spread across lots of different mail server products: Exchange (of course), Axigen, Ipswitch Imail, Kerio, Lotus Domino, MDaemon, Postfix, Neon Insight, Qmail, Sendmail, Smartermail, Sun Messaging server, Zimbra, Communigate, Mailenable and many others. Now, it seems, in the corporate space, due to the appeal of Microsoft&#x27;s vast product suite, most companies have moved or will be moving to Microsoft 365. Question: Is this setup healthy? This might be exaggeration, but in years to come, since all data will be housed and managed by one company (Microsoft), will we even need the SMTP protocol?

 Some rough specifics: 
  
The room is 30&#x27;x30&#x27;, with a 10&#x27; ceiling. 18&quot;-24&quot; raised floors.
 This room is not actively cooled, anticipated btu/hr is &lt;50K
  
What I&#x27;ve looked at thus far in the past couple of weeks (All units within the 3-5 ton range):
  
Dual Liebert PDX11&#x27;s with condensing units
 Dual Liebert Data mates/min mates with condensing units
 Dual Stulz MinSpace EC

 Cyber security is often very dry, confusing, and uninteresting to the average user. Ninjio has training which I think is informative, entertaining, and easy to digest. 
 Since we&#x27;ve started using them, our security instances have gone way down. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Checking previous posts on the subreddit i see how little regard people have on them, and this will not help matters. Their main SSL certificate expired 4 days ago. Tried to create an account to reduce the amount of captchas to fill for unblocking while handling a range of IPs that seems to have gotten a few IPs blacklisted there for some reason, the confirmation email required to activate the account never arrives (which makes sense if they use the certificate on their SMTP, providers would likely reject email from a server with an expired cert). And when using their contact form to let them know i get the very helpful response of:
  
An Error Occurred!
 Error:
  
And nothing else. 
 So, if anyone has an alternative way to nudge those people to go and fix their SSL, please do so. In the meanwhile i guess it&#x27;s captchas time...

 My problem is that I have racked my brain over a user issue which I cannot seem to solve using the obvious means and after lots of research online. What&#x27;s worse is that the user is already pushing hard and escalates things with our manager (yes he works in the it department as well).
 My question is whether it&#x27;s ok or not to admit that I don&#x27;t know how to resolute an issue, especially after exhausting all options I can think of.

I am looking for a product that will notify me via a message box popup or notification message while sitting at a windows 11 workstation for a few physical doors. I imagine that something like an IoT magnetic sensor exists, but most just seem to send notifications to phones - I want the popup on the workstation so that I see it while working on the PC. Any help or suggestions are appreciated.

                              <span>On all our administrative GUIs (VMware vCenter, Storage Systems, Back-up solutions, SAN management, iDRACs, Container Environment), we configure AD authentication together with basic (local) authentication. This basic authentication is used as a &#x27;workaround&#x27; in case AD would be unaccessible, or someone messes up the AD binding, or makes a change on AD level.
 While there are already cases where we had to use the local user, it poses a huge security risk since these are static credentials and there is no policy in place to rotate them. 
 How do you guys approach this? I&#x27;m aware Microsoft doesn&#x27;t recommend password rotation anymore and instead advices to use MFA together with long/complex passwords. I assume this is not possible with basic authentication? Would you disable basic authentication completely? What happened where you than were lock-out because of an underlying AD issue?

                              <span>Looking for ideas on how we can perform server administration/desktop administration for a 2 man IT team supporting ~160 users.
 as it is now I log in as a standard user to my desktop. For any type of desktop elevation I need to perform, I use my la_first initial last name account. If I need to log into the file server for example, I use my ja_first initial last name account to log into any server BUT the file server and jump to the file server using admin share to do what I need to do. Create a folder, permissions, etc. 
 So that’s 3 accounts I have. Well my boss has only recently started practicing separation of duties and we are looking at ways we can standardize this for both of us. I’ve just been recently promoted to a Jr. Sys admin and am going to be given more access to servers. 
 How do you handle this in your org?

 Each time I run a threaded command like...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /MT:32 /Z 
 ... on the same location I get a summary report each time with differing file counts and sizes.

 The threaded command copies the files fine (when I check manually), but I need to prove the results after and the summary suggests an incomplete copy.
 The threaded command is wicked fast compared to the normal way, but I&#x27;m having to run a slow /L after the fact just to prove the file counts match.
 ​
 Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just doing something wrong?

 The provider is not important but since I found an automatic scraper for Google Translate, I am going to use Google. The problem is that after only a few translations, my IP gets banned.
 How can I have my work done? Have in mind that I don&#x27;t care how long it is going to take. I just want it done. 
 P.S. I was thinking about paying for a proxy server but then I am going to rotate only about 10 IP, which, in my assumption, will also get banned.

 I was thinking to go for professional version but I’m not entirely sure whether it will cause any legal/license issues to me later on since my professional version will be for Personal use.
 I asked company IT team and they said as long as it doesn’t prompt local admin credentials to be entered, I can use it. 
 Some clarity would be helpful here.

 Anyone have an idea how this works? I cant find any MS Docs about this. If I set the setting Manually it works as expected, but creating new sites doesn&#x27;t set it right. If I press Reset settings to org-settings it changes to the correct setting, thats the most weird thing. Anyone any tips?

                              <span>Is there anyone here who has experience using Snipe-IT that can advise on its capability for tracking a large volume of repairs and RMAs?
 For a Little context, we currently use an out dated system that was developed in house to manage movement of assets(we provide retailers with IT hardware and often install loan equipment while we repair or obtain replacement equipment for the customer). We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.
 I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having &quot;Location A&quot; and &quot;Location A-RMA area&quot;). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.

Our company wants to provide IPADs to BODs with MS O365 subscription which enables the BODs to edit or view files on O365, however on the other hand my company also wants that BODs will only save files locally and restricts them to upload files on O365 cloud. Is it possible to restrict them or we cannot restrict them

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been chewing over this scenario in my mind for ages and woke up today with it bugging me more than normal.
 If you&#x27;re a SysAdmin, technician or IT &quot;manager&quot; in a small/medium sized company, where you&#x27;re the only on-site IT presence, and your company outsources support for network/server infrastructure, workstation support, third party liaison, 365 management etc. to an MSP, how are you justifying your role?
 I work for an MSP and have to deal with IT staff like this all the time, and I really can&#x27;t imagine how they manage to keep themselves busy on a day to day basis.
 I understand that anything that requires an on-site presence can be immediately handled by someone like yourselves, whether it be plugging in a replacement HDD into a NAS or installing workstations, replacing cables or …</span>

                              <span>I want to keep this as tl;dr as possible.
 ​
 We have a few hundred notebooks and (Mini-)PCs in our company, and a few months ago it seems Microsoft introduced a (or a few) very, VERY annoying bug(s) when it comes to mainly DisplayPort connected screens... things still worked pretty much without issues, so I (we) suspect a random Windows Update as the culprit by this point.
 ​
 People have called many, MANY times by now about (but not only) ...
 ... flickering displays
 ... screens that randomly turn black mid working, yet Windows still sees them as connected so it suddenly becomes a &quot;ghost display&quot;
 ... random colors flickering
 ... screens not waking up once it went into Standby
 ... weird resolution issues when using Display to DVI adapters
 ... and so on...
 ​
 I am... really at my end here and so is the rest of our IT team. This doesn&#x27;t just happen on notebooks, this also happens on Mini- and normal full size PCs, it doesn&#x27;t matter what graphics card even. This happens on Intel... NVidia... AMD... and so far this almost exclusively is happening on DisplayPort connected screens. Almost all of those displays don&#x27;t have HDMI tho, or if they have most of the Docking Stations only have one HDMI out.
 So yeah, just a little rant about this...

 As in title, I am fighting those pesky MS Store apps. I removed MS Store from my &quot;golden image&quot; however user is still able to install apps that are present in Start Menu, Messengers and alike. I do not have InTune, I work with Pro versions of Windows. Anybody is able to point me in the right direction? What I want to achieve is to prevent users from downloading/installing those apps.

                              <span>Well well well, if it isn&#x27;t the consequences of someone else&#x27;s actions. Started very recently at a place and the wildcard SSL certs expired. (It was on my list of things to check but didn&#x27;t get to it in time.) No biggie, they&#x27;re renewed. Start popping them on everything that uses them. But I&#x27;ve never used/managed ADFS before, nor MS Dynamics 365 CRM. I walk through MS documents, get the certs setup for ADFS and get the Relying Party Trusts working again. I get certs renewed in the 365 Deployment Manager. Updated the CRM IIS bindings.
 I now get the login screen, and it logs in, but fails with: 
  
Error Details: ID4175: The issuer of the security token was not recognized by the IssuerNameRegistry. To accept security tokens from this issuer configure the IssuerNameRegistry to return a valid name for this issuer.
  
I don&#x27;t have cert thumprints in my web.config and as far as I can tell, everything is running the new cert. But it definitely isn&#x27;t, because something is failing. I&#x27;ve been googling and reading for the past day and haven&#x27;t figured it out. Any tips would be appreciated. If you help me figure it out, I&#x27;ll send you a local craft beer or donate to an animal shelter. Your pick :).

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty experienced with Varnish and VCL (sysadmin 2 years), but this seems to be an uncommon case because of a couple of factors.
 I have a new hitch/varnish server running as a remote caching proxy serving a node.js backend halfway across the Internet. The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can&#x27;t connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it&#x27;s serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -&gt; return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.
 How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000? There&#x27;s so many possible factors at play that I&#x27;m a bit lost. All replies appreciated.

                              <span>It’s a simple router on a stick setup. Switch is in L2 mode and the FG has 2 SVIs (Vlan 1 and 100). Port on switch is trunked, and default gateway is the FG. The FG is replacing a 2901 router, which I converted the config almost identical over to the FG. Works on the router but once I hook up to the FG, it dies. 
 Im thinking it’s a problem with the Virtual Interfaces being tagged with vlan 1 but I’m not sure. Seeing if anyone else ran into this.

                              <span>We host services for our clients in our datacenters, and they get access either through private wan connectivity, sdwan, or anyconnect. Usually we test circuits and such with iperf, but I was thinking it may be useful to setup a html5 speed test server on each of our datacenters that users and clients could be directed to with a url link. Opera would still be used for when we need to test isolated links. But for initial testing, it would be much easier than walking clients through iperf. 
 This isn&#x27;t something I want internet facing or anything, just for internal testing to our datacenters. 
 Has any one set something up like this in an enterprise setting? I see open speed test as an open source solution. But curious about potential security concerns because we would have to get it past security obviously. 
 Just looking to see if others have done something like this and what recommendations people may have.

 Hoping that someone can take the time to help me identify an issue that has been kicking my butt. Any help is appreciated, I&#x27;m at a level of stress I haven&#x27;t felt in years and feel like I am missing something glaringly obvious.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve recently inherited a network where there is a site to site link connecting several remote servers to our network. Their remote servers and our internal network are on a class C address range (192.168.x.x). When I am connected to our network, I am able to ping the servers that are connected to us through the site to site SSL VPN. However, when I am connected to the VPN on a remote network I am unable to connect to the servers on the other end of the site to site link, no ping, and traceroute displays nothing. The VPN network was configured as a class…</span>

 We have recently bought Dell switches with OS10, configuration is pretty easy with VLT and I find it easier to manage as well. But our Dell Account Manager pushed us to install SONIC OS in the switches and I found almost very few documentations online and almost no documented best practices. (I had to reach out to Dell Technical team to find out that MCLAG Keepalive is not possible when the Management port is mgmt vrf)
 How was your experience in deploying Dell with SONIC?

                              <span>This is my first time moving network equipment over to being on its own restricted management VLAN.
 I am using an old switch to practice a few things on first, so that I dont screw up production.
 So with that said, I pulled an old Dell N2024P switch out of the closet, flashed the latest firmware, and did the following which seems to have worked in terms of setting up a management VLAN. What I did:
  
Add VLAN 10 called &quot;Mgmt&quot;
 Assigned IP address 10.11.10.6 /24 to the VLAN 10 interface.
 Removed the IP address from the default VLAN 1 interface
 Marked ports 1-23 untagged VLAN 1, marked port 24 untagged VLAN 10.
  
So with that, I now can only access the management interface for the switch by plugging into port 24 and assigning a 10.11.10.X /24 IP to my network adapter. Great, this is fun…</span>

                              <span>I’m predicting that with the timing of this year’s World Cup, it will become a huge fad(here in the US) that will explode over the Thanksgiving break and just about everyone will have at least one game streaming during peak network time, won’t be surprised if there are some who have the PC, Phone &amp; Tablet going at the same time. Obviously NBAR and some traffic shaping would be an easy fix but I’m convinced our company leadership has compromising photos of our department head and when the higher ups complain about the quality of their video stream, he will pass the problem onto us to implement some sort of solution.
 Currently our internet link utilization averages around 75-80% and we just use QoS to ensure critical traffic is guaranteed bandwidth when there is congestion. Increasing the capacity of our pipe isn’t an option and we’ve tried for years to alter our network acceptable use policy(people LOVE to buy switches on amazon and plug it into both wall jacks in their office). 
 Any recommendation regarding how I can manage this upcoming problem? I’m assuming that we’re not the only team with this issue particularly South Americans who also have to deal with the time difference and beloved sporting event happening during work hours.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 One of the company I work for would like to test some chassis before deployment. They can recover some parts from a partner venture (ISP) before purchase a batch of those.
 Initial config would go as follow:
 ASR-9006-AC-V2 (2 fans, 3 pwrs both V2)
 2x A9K-RSP880-LT-SE
 2x A9K-8X100GE-SE
 Beside common BGP, OSPF they need to be capable of :
  
Multicast Routing Protocols (PIM, IGMP)
 Security package (SSH, SSL)
 SSO-NSF, FHRP, LACP, BFD
 MPLS (Traffic Engineering, Layer 3 VPN including VRFs, RSVP, EVCs, Layer2VPN, EVPN)
  
For what I can read online, I don&#x27;t understand what difference is between A9K-RSP880-LT-SE and A9K-RSP880-SE is there any limitation to the LT version?
 Also I can read that we would need to buy some licensing for VRF which is this A9K-800G-AIP-SE.
 Is there anything else that would be required in order to make this work?
 Obviously I could go and ask Cisco but I already know I would only receive a explainer with a BOM for ASR99XX which we are not interested in currently.
 If anyone is an expert, I would glady listen to advice.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping for some guidance here in regard to a wireless implementation. Side Note: I&#x27;m fairly new to wireless.
 The implementation is across two physical Locations where one is a giant freezer and the other is an Ambient Warehouse. The AP&#x27;s in each area are in their own AP Group and Flexconnect Group. 
 The issue right now is when handheld devices are in the Freezer they have no signal.
 From what I can tell when testing signal on site. My laptop stays connected to the Ambient Warehouse when inside the Freezer. All the strongest signals I see when standing in the freezer are from the Ambient Warehouse AP&#x27;s and very bad signal from some of the AP&#x27;s in the Freezer.
 The AP&#x27;s in each area are different models. C9115AXI-E and AIR-CAP1532E-A-K9. A 3rd party designed and configured this solution, and I am lining them up for a troubleshooting session.

 Has anyone got any recommendation on what I need to be looking at?

                              <span>Hi all, first post on here but I have utilized this subs info for quite some time.
 To paint the general picture. I recently started a new position and found myself needing to assign some of our available static IPs for new security cameras that were being installed. This led me to the IP spreadsheet that the company utilizes. I know that this is not uncommon, but I have never encountered one so inaccurate/outdated. A few basic NMAP scans showed just how bad it is.. but not to derail, I got approval to begin purging and updating the spreadsheets.
 My current process (only testing atm, I have not begun updating the spreadsheet) is an NMAP scan: nmap -sn -PR and: nmap -sn -PS. I also run a scan through the IP Address Management tool in the Solarwinds toolkit that the company utilizes. Finally, I will ping the IP from the local switch itself (if applicable).
 I know this technique is redundant and most likely not the most effective method. Thus, before I begin, I was hoping to gather any suggestions or techniques that others may use to ensure that an IP address is not in use.

                              <span>This is an FYI post. For the last 2-3 weeks we have been having intermittent flapping of connectivity within our Meraki AutoVPN network. We have 4 offices in a mesh topology. The event logs on our MX firewall would show entries for &#x27;VPN Tunnel Connectivity Change&#x27; and &#x27;connectivity: false&#x27; while specifying the peer losing connectivity. It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues. Hoping this post will save someone some time in the future.

                              <span>Hi guys. Im trying to improve roaming capabilities of clients inside a massive cinderblock building of concrete. The equipment we are running is as follows
 AIR-CT5520-K9
 Mix of Cisco 3800/9120 APs.
 I was looking at the WLC and saw a few potential settings to modify to improve client connectivity. The building itself has a pretty good density of APs (over 90) and we do not want to or think adding more is the correct solution to fighting concrete everywhere.
  
Want to change client roaming aggressiveness under Wireless ----&gt; 802.11a/n/ac/ax to a minimum RRSI threshold of -80.
 Changing RF profiles specifically for this building.
  
Any thoughts or tips you guys have used in the past for this type of environment?

                              <span>hey i was wondering today why the private ip spaces are exactly e.g. 10.x.x.x or 192.x.x.x etc. instead of e.g. 1.x.x.x and then up to say 3.x.x.x. I didn&#x27;t find anything right away, but maybe someone here knows. 
 ​
 And also another question about this. What other IP spaces are there? I know about 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16. But I also know that there are spaces like 0.0.0.0/0 and 255.x.x.x/x.

I am peering with my RP via bgp on the edge of my network, a direct connect, that router is configured to accept multicast now but due to an oddity I have a switch next. So it is foreign RP, router, switch1, firewall, switch2, multicast clients.
 For the switch1 how would you all handle it? Would you turn on layer 3 and route multicast between the router and firewall or just extend a vlan between the two.

                              <span>We have been experiencing a rather weird problem over the last two days which I am really struggling to resolve, even with the support of Meraki. I would really appreciate any words of advice. :)
 We have a Meraki setup within our office. We are utilising 4 MS210-48LP switches and 17 MR36 WAPs placed throughout our office environment. Client devices are connecting via Wi-Fi only and this setup has been working for the past year without any issues.
 Over the last few days, we had a few reports of users complaining of Wi-Fi drops. In the last 48hrs, the problem has snowballed and a lot of users are now complaining of issues.
 I myself and a handful of users have not experienced the problem. I can&#x27;t pinpoint any differences between our client devices. All clients are HP and running Windows 10…</span>

 I have been requested to disable all ports besides a MAC ACL. Which contains the laptops that are allowed in , moving free in between ports.
 question is how do I make the list synchronized in between two switches,
 and how do I make the list efficiently considering there are more than 50 different laptops.
 Thanks for your help (:

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I face an issue in my network environment, the detail is as following:
 We have 2 ISP with the IP&#x27;s (example) below :
 ISP 1: 103.45.24.0/24
 ISP 2: 203.17.25.0/24
 ​
 here is our brief environment: https://ibb.co/gv36xDx
 ​
 There is requirement from my manager whether is it possible, if we have app publish to internet where if the IP public from ISP 1 (103.45.24.0/24) - dnat to - Web Server is down or fail then the IP (103.45.24.0/24) failover to ISP 2. Otherwise, if IP Public ISP 2 down or fail then the IP failover to ISP 1 ?
 ​
 I have searched and still looking for anything about BGP who explain this explicitly but still have no clue how to configure it.
 ​
 I have basic knowledge in networking and make use GNS3 for lab and prove of concept before going into production.
 ​
 If there is a paid course or anything in particular or video tutorial that i can follow.
 I would like to take and pay for it.
 ​
 Really appreciate anyone who look into this.

                              <span>Hi,
 I ve 2 router and each router connect to different ISP with different AS number. 
 Router A in AS10 and announce 10.10.10.0/24 subnet without prepend and announce 10.10.20.0/24 subnet with AS_prepend AS10-AS10.
 Router B in AS20 and announce 10.10.20.0/24 subnet without prepend and announce 10.10.10.0/24 subnet with AS_prepend AS20-AS20.
 So the internet sends 10.10.10.0/24 to AS10 and sends 10.10.20.0/24 to AS20. But in recent days ISP of Router B has a problem and we aren&#x27;t receive trafic to 10.10.20.0/24.
 Is there any solution to ınternet knows 10.10.20.0/24 from AS10, without changing AS_prepend config. For example is there any command for when i notice again ISP B has a problem.
 Thanks,

                              <span>So, I set up a Ubiquiti network for a client last summer: Edgerouter-X + Unifi WAPs. Flat LAN: all on 192.168.10.0/24 (all good since then).
 Now, he has some Ethernet-capable CNC machines and a monitoring device (from Chatter), and the monitoring service told him to set up VLANs. So, he asked me to set up VLANs.
 I go out, set up VLANs as follows:
  
192.168.10.0/24 -&gt; VLAN 0 (default, original)
 192.168.20.0/24 -&gt; VLAN 20 for CNCs
 192.168.30.0/24 -&gt; VLAN 30 for Wifi
  
For the machines, we set static IPs since he uploads designs to the machines via FTP and he types in the IP address directly. Fine, good.
 I set the CNCs&#x27; static IPs as:
  
192.168.20.11 (later)
 192.168.20.12
  
VLAN 20 DHCP range is 192.168.20.101 to 192.168.20.200 to reserve the lower range for static IPs.

                              <span>I have been testing Juniper Access switches and Mist wired assurance recently. I have gone through testing all the features we require (802.1x, dhcp security, voice vlans and qos, switch stacking, etc) and it seems to check all the boxes. Mist is missing a few knobs, but we can accomplish these through CLI templates. What is everyone&#x27;s recent experience, specifically around ex4400 and potentially ex4100? We use MX routers and have had very good success with these. We also have been deploying Mist wireless with good success. My main concern is code and hardware reliability.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi!
 I would like to know if there exists scenarios where an 802.1Q tag is applied by the host from which the traffic originates rather than by a network device which forwards that traffic. I have yet to encounter such scenario.
 Thanks!

 All great answers everybody, thank you.

                              <span>So may be a dumb topic, by hey nothing gained if nothing ventured.
 So I pass CCNA last year in January which been sitting on collecting dust since I been focus on RHCSA which finally passed yesterday. So I realize I should look into ways on how to renew it. I think Continuing education credits would be the quickest but also going for CCNP would work as well.
 with the later however, it meant to go more in depth on networking which would be interesting. only problem why I&#x27;m a little hesitant is from a Odem book I had some time ago certain topics in the early chapter mention technology which was cisco exclusive. I mean that expected since its is Cisco lol, but reason CCNA get respect is that it try to stay as foundational as possible.
 So I want to ask anyone who made a jump to 301 to ENCORE (which I gather the most congruent pathway) just how similar are they in term of concepts. like a 20% differences, &amp; if so are said differences more Cisco&#x27;s exclusives protocols and such?
 P.S if anyone know where to find learning material which just touch the new stuff. pretty please let I know!

                              <span>I’ve recently come into the position of being the IT admin for a small video company with existing IT infrastructure and could use some help recovering a VPN that’s stopped working some time in the last 2 weeks. Now when trying to connect — all our VPN clients run macOS Ventura or Monterey — I instantly receive the following error message:
  
VPN Connection
 The L2TP-VPN server did not respond. Try reconnecting. If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator.
  
I’ve observed the same error message on both macOS versions mentioned.
 The public IP doesn’t respond to ping — which I know doesn’t necessarily mean anything other than all the ports on the router are stealthed, which is fine from a security standpoint — although all other network resources (authentication, NAS access, internet access from the inside) are working just fine.
 The network runs on:
  
A Ubiquiti UniFi USG-PRO-4 firewall
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Switch 48 US-48-500W PoE switch
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2 UCK-62 controller
 A Dell PowerEdge T320 running Windows Server 2012
  
I reached out to the previous IT guy, but he’s incommunicado. Then I found some Windows Server updates pending … those’ll get installed tonight.
 Any help, even diagnosing from first steps would be greatly appreciated!

As part of my bachelor&#x27;s thesis I was tasked with analyzing, deploying and testing flexiWAN Open Source SD-WAN solution so I can later compare it to other SD-WAN solutions on the market. Unfortunately so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find any meaningful resources regarding flexiWAN SD-WAN other than what you can find on their website, which is not much. That brings me to the question, does someone here have experience working with flexiWAN, who could point me to study resources or anything that would give me an insight into how the tech works ? Any help will be wholeheartedly appreciated :)

                              <span>Hey guys.
 Currently have a small network with a single ISP line. We are adding another ISP with matching address space. Our address spaces are from the provider and are too small to advertise with BGP. 
 Outbound traffic seems pretty easy and lots of options with FHRP/track objects/route maps/etc but was wondering about inbound traffic. We have an authoritative DNS server being hosted on-prem. Wondering if I could add multiple glue records with each provider&#x27;s address and have multiple host records to allow inbound traffic to failover.
 Also wondering the pros/cons of using VRRP vs track objects and a floating static route. Have labbed the scenario just having a floating static on the main provider tied to a track object and having the secondary provider router inject a default route into OSPF. If the primary goes down then the static will be replaced by the OSPF learned route.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m looking to get rid of a Fast Ethernet Bridge that links two nearby office buildings. I would replace it with an SFP Module that plugs directly into the main switches in each building. That said I want to make sure I get the right module.
 From what I see, we have a black (Multi Mode?) run that runs underground into each building. From there it goes into a beige box with multiple jacks. The beige junction box then connects to a Fast Ethernet Bridge using a Fiber Patch Cable.
 I&#x27;m not sure if you can tell from the picture but I&#x27;m pretty sure I need a MultiMode SFP Module for both of my switches. Any clarification\correction on the correct module would be appreciated.

                              <span>TL;DR: How do you use REST APIs to improve your monitoring abilities?
  
With the increase of focus on DevOps has led to performing many actions and automated tasks with APIs! You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. 
 What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? 
 Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. 
  
 Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? 
  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I&#x27;m not an application or web developer by any means, so I can&#x27;t speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I&#x27;m more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.

                              <span>Hi,
 In my company, we are supporting many remote office locations. A common complaint is to see that wireless or wired network speeds are slow (most engineers will be familiar with same). 
 Just wondering, what tools/apps you use to document and test network speeds in a global network environment?
 I am thinking of a way to benchmark network performance. i.e get an onsite contact to run a series of test on LAN/WLAN etc and to document the results versus what the expected results should be.
 This can then be used as the benchmark when future issues are raised to help understand if the speeds are compromised, links saturated or other IT issue etc
 Any suggestions on tools or similar processes or any thoughts in general?

                              <span>Hey guys, feeling kinda dumb on this one and I figured this would be the right place to ask a quick question.
 Does anyone know of a set of Visio stencils (preferably vendor-agnostic) containing pretty much all conceivable switch sizes - 8, 12, 16, and so on - with anchor points on each port? 
 I&#x27;m putting together some Visio diagrams of an existing network we&#x27;ll be taking over. It&#x27;s an absolute rat&#x27;s nest, and we&#x27;re likely going to tear it all out regardless.. but I&#x27;d like to write an as-built that encapsulates Layer 1, and review it with outgoing IT to make sure our cutover plan captures everything.
 edit: Guys, respectfully, I&#x27;m not looking for pointers on network documentation. This is a unique situation necessitating this visualization, and I&#x27;m just asking if anyone&#x27;s aware of a stencil set that might help accommodate it.

                              <span>Good morning,
 I am having an issue with my native VLAN assignment for some reason and I am not sure why. I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this
 BR-44-MDF&gt; show vlan members port 1/1/49
 vlan type status
 100 default forwarding
 112 qtagged forwarding
 164 qtagged forwarding
 184 qtagged forwarding
 188 qtagged forwarding
 601 qtagged forwarding
 When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with 
 Native VLAN: 1
 Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188
 I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn&#x27;t throw an error for overlapping subnets. 
 BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief
 Interface IP Address Interface Status
 vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up
 vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up
 I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>Do you have documented sleep standards for doing major, or at least non-routine work? I&#x27;m hearing more &quot;man, I was really tired, but I got it done&quot; comments from my team. One comment about how work didn&#x27;t go smoothly, but it did complete, but they didn&#x27;t sleep well the night before.
 It&#x27;s not something I ever thought about for our team, but other industries have such standards, so I&#x27;m curious what others think/do.

Even if you fluent with big boys like Cisco, Forti, Palo and Checkpoint (does Zscaler counts there?) there are many point solutions and vendors looking at some specific subdomains only, for example just datacenter mico-segmentation or only remote access.
 Is there some restless team of professionals giving it a try and showcasing GUI and declared features? Have you seen YouTube or series of blog articles?

 I’m looking for some advice on fiber carrier connectivity from Bermuda to U.S. the company I work for has an office and DC. Today they use Link Bermuda and another ISP but the cost is exorbitant due to data usage charges. A local manager brought up Horizon Communications but I’m looking to see all options available.
 Any advice is appreciated.

 I have notice that I&#x27;m getting alerts on 4 of our 13 Netgear switches for interface cpu() with operational statuses of 1 (up) and 2 (Down). Sometimes it shows down for a few minutes other times over 10 mins. The switches are still operational during this time as far as I can tell. Doesnt seem to be any coloration between model numbers either.
 The SNMP OID is 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.51. cant really seem to find anything on this OID for netgear kit. anyone have any pointers for me? 
 Models with this issue are GS748T V4H1 , 2x GS716T V2, GS724T V3,

                              <span>Hi, I have an area that has been recently fitted out and included an abundance of APs which I now wish to deactivate some. I was thinking instead to turn them into Air Monitors but I am a bit unsure as to what value I will actually see from these? I have configured an AP group as Air Monitors and put some access points in it but I can&#x27;t really see how I monitor or quantify the value they add or log what they are actually doing for our environment? We are running Mobility Conductors with 8.6 and we also have Airwave. Is there somewhere I can monitor the Air Monitors and see what they are achieving? Cheers.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Im trying to connect a copper SFP 10G (from Mikrotik) to a stacked C9300 to a DELL switch (that also supports 10Gb) but there is no link between them. I&#x27;ve tried different ethernet cables but no success. I tried the same ethernet cable to connect between two regular 1G copper port and it works so nothing wrong on the cable (it is a CAT6 cable). 
 I also tried to connect the copper SFP between the stacked switches (I connected one copper SFP in one port on the master switch and one copper SFP in the slave switch and connected an ethernet cable between them) and still no success, but Im not sure if you could do these tests between stacked switches.
 Either way, I also checked if that the interfaces are not in shutdown mode or err-disabled mode.
 I configured the &quot;service unsupported-transceiver&quot; to see if that will change anything but no success. 
 The setup I have is a stacked 9300 (two switches) and plugged in two copper SFPs, one in the master switch and one in the slave switch that goes to a dell switch so I can form a LACP between the stacked C9300 and the dell switch.
 Appreciate any help.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently reworking our corporation&#x27;s wifi and I&#x27;ve got EAP-TLS working, however I want to permit only a specific group of users from our local AD.
 I&#x27;ve got the CA up and running and publishing certificates all around to the computers (old setup) and I&#x27;ve got the ruleset for EAP-TLS working with GPO on the Windows domain computers.
 My problem now is that I need to permit access only to a specific group in AD as the ruleset just points to users/domain computers so everyone with a domain computer gets access.
 Once a user who&#x27;s not in the group logs on I want the authentication to fail.
 I&#x27;ve tried adding /users/domain computers AND /group/ as a requirement in the auth policy, but the group I added in ISE External Identity Source/groups doesn&#x27;t show up in the policy. I also removed a few groups and it doesn&#x27;t seem to update in the policy set or the condition library.
 Is this a known bug in ISE 3.1?
 I need the computers to log in to the wireless prior to actually logging into the computer so it can reach the DC for login, then drop out of the user is not in the specific Security Group.

                              <span>Hello Dear Subreddit, 
 I need to migrate a IPSEC Tunnel from a Sophos UTM to a Fortigate 200F.
 Remote Gateway is a Checkpoint Firewall. So far so good. 
 Now I face 33(!) SA&#x27;s which are established on the Sophos. Let me point you a picture:
 Sophos : Site A
 Checkpoint: Site B
 ​
 Site A got following Networks:
 192.168.105.0/24
 192.168.100.0/22
 and a Host 192.168.40.100/32 
 ​
 Site B:
 10.3.0.0/24
 10.2.0.0/24
 10.1.0.0/24
 10.1.7.0/24
 10.1.4.0/24
 10.1.6.0/24
 10.1.2.0/24
 10.1.1.0/24
 10.1.8.0/24
 10.1.5.0/24
 10.1.3.0/24
 ​
 I&#x27;d love to do SNAT on Site B, but I&#x27;ve never done that on Checkpoint. I know on FortiGate we can use 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and let the Policies do the Denying. Is there a way to do that on Checkpoint or how would you go about this problem ?

                              <span>I have a Japanese shitbox PR-600MI.
 I am trying to have traffic come into the LAN ports on the router and then get routed to my sperate internal network.
 The static routing doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. All of the LAN cables have to be plugged into the PR-600MI and there is no way around that aspect.
 I&#x27;m trying to fix the internal routing as the solution.
 PR-600mi network: 192.168.1.1/24 Linksys velop network: 10.10.10.1/24
 I had the Linksys velop on the 192 network but the pr600 was blackholing all dhcp requests and wouldn&#x27;t work.
 Tried changing it to a different subnet but now the pr600 won&#x27;t route to the 10.10 no matter what I do, including static routes.
 Does anyone have any experience with velop ? Maybe it is a Linksys side issue?

                              <span>I am very uneducated on this subject and just received a very well articulated ransom threat. This is very likely spam, but reading more into CobaltStrike, what it is and the capabilities of it. I am horribly underprepared. I have so many questions if anyone is open to pm I would love to pick your brain.

 I&#x27;m learning a lot already, but any points that might help someone brand new to this stuff feel free to say.

                              <span>So my company will be opening a manufacturing plant in the next year or so. I need to start planning the network for this location and am looking for any advice or things to consider when planning. I have built out dozens of networks in the past but they have always been for office locations not manufacturing and I am not sure if anything special is needed. 
 Any advice you can provide would be helpful. Thanks

Every solution I’ve tried (load website as screensaver but uses IE, optisign) has been completely unpredictable with our 15 minute Lock Screen policy. Has anyone had any experience with undedicated digital signage that could point me in the right direction?

Get to meet the local Technical manager, not really an “IT guy” but knows enough to be dangerous and has been covering things.

                              <span>Always interested to hear the kinds of traps to avoid when setting up something new. I&#x27;m making a completely fresh AD/AAD environment for fun, trying to mirror our current hybrid environment, and want to make sure I do it as cleanly and future-proofed as possible. It&#x27;s going to be my personal test environment, I&#x27;m hoping it can save me some trouble in the future since half the time there seems to be some little bug or security hardening that sneaks through unnoticed (or undocumented) for monthly patching. Plus it&#x27;s a fun project in general, I always end up taking jobs where it&#x27;s all set up already, never got to try making my own environment fully from scratch. So far I&#x27;m just building lots of Server 2022 VMs in Hyper-V on a spare laptop and using a free Azure account to see how far I can get, going to be a long road ahead to get everything like our work environment but hopefully will learn a lot.

                              <span>I had a group of help desk guys who would play RuneScape all day and would barely put in effort. They never went above and beyond for anyone and just did the bare minimum.
 I admit I’m not the best manager I’m a systems engineer who got thrown into management. I let the get away with a lot to try and avoid conflict. One day I got fed and told them no more games, no more messing around at work, and started opening tickets up for everything. I really turned up the heat. I ended our 2 day remote policy.
 The help desk guys started dropping like flies and quit with out having another job. I’ve re-hired new help desk guys and 6 months later they are the most efficient group ever and the company is even giving them a raise due to the hard work they put in.
 I learned my lesson as a new manager. I’m so happy that everything ended up okay.

                              <span>Anyone else seeing strange BSODs after applying either KB5019964 or KB5020614 (Patch Tuesday cumulative or .Net cumulative patch, respectively) causing baremetal Server 2016 hosts to BSOD? We are only seeing this on older (Haswell/Broadwell based) hosts. I checked chipset drivers, they are latest supplied by manufacturers. Culprit is the intelppm.sys driver, which seems to be some kind of power management service; disabling the service from Automatic Recovery allows the machine to boot normally again.
 Edit: I should add the bsod error is SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

                              <span>Good day, all! I am interested in what tools, applications or suites this community uses to monitor their IIS servers. My team would like to monitor for number of connections, system / site performance, etc, for our locally hosted server and it looks like any number of tools out there will work though there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any recent information or opinions from real Sys Admins.
 And so here I am, asking this community for your thoughts, feelings, experiences with the multitude of products out there. I don&#x27;t have any preferences (paid vs. open source, etc); I&#x27;m just genuinely interested in your reviews and recommendations before diving into any number of free trials and getting talked up by sales folks.
 Thanks in advance. Cheers!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in my current role nearly 10 years, and to be honest for the most part I really enjoy it. They&#x27;ve been pretty lacking in pay raises and bonuses though, and when a former colleague set me up with an interview, I took it - my first interview in 10 years.
 It went well, and they made me an offer which is nearly 35% above my current salary. Obviously it&#x27;s an incredible offer, and I&#x27;m delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it&#x27;s going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I&#x27;m accepting.
 Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I&#x27;m not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I&#x27;d need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who&#x27;s 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do the nursery run.
 My new prospective boss says that in his team, he&#x27;s super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I&#x27;m just.... Hesitant. I know that it&#x27;s because of my WFH lifestyle that I&#x27;m used to - I guess I&#x27;m just wondering, how do I get over this fear? Have any of you made a similar transition?

                              <span>Today I had my customer, who is in a highly regulated sector, come to me. We are in the middle of a datamigration from onprem to Azure Files. He asked how much it costs to backup the Azure Files. I give him a quote. His answer: &quot;Well that&#x27;s really expensive. I&#x27;m not sure if we need to do it. I mean, how often do you need backups? &quot;
 Well mister, you might want to contact your auditor and state that &#x27;indeed: we do not backup our most important financial data&#x27;. I got it al written down and escalated to my manager. I know that backups are required in this sector but the client itself apparently does not. My lord it&#x27;s only wednesday and I need a drink.

                              <span>How do I convince C level users that having one person in IT support and keeping Admin rights is insane. We have no security posture and whenever I mention security it is treated like it’s working against the company. As with many companies security is an after thought which is then ignored. As I have a life I’ve stopped working late to support the company because I need to have a work life a balance. 
 Development of course has many people many devops engineers but there is no infosec, CTO, CIO, Tech lead or anyone of the sort.
 P.S I know quitting is a good move considering I care more about the company than the owners but I want to see if I can find a way to get a managerial promotion and if I can save this ship. I’ll probably be leaving anyways.

The president wants me right there in the middle of the office to take care of issues but there is nobody to connect with. People only come to my desk to complain and sometimes I wish I had a (IT Dungeon) to hide in. I felt less lonely working from home in a help desk environment. Maybe this is just a rant but any solo IT people also feel this way.

                              <span>Hi, Will give a bit of info about current setup. What I have ready to go in and then the big question.
 So, i work with another IT guy in the company I&#x27;m currently at. Hes so behind the times but he has been here 10 years longer than me so people just go with what he says and people are afraid to say anything to him as we use this bespoke software that he keeps in his head, I&#x27;ve asked for years for him to show me but he never does, put in compaints that he hasnt shown me and nothing is done about it, its so frustrating. I actually found him running the backups from a 2003 server on a P4 a few weeks ago with an external drive hanging from it. He refused to stop running it so i took the RAM out of it. 
 Our sister company which is the breadwinner in this outfit use IT to max and there are 70…</span>

 The scenario is a disaster happens at the primary site. Everybody needs to login at the secondary site. (different FW, different VPN). We disable the IPSEC tunnel and we disable the FW policies between the two sites to simulate the disaster at the primary site. Everything works and is tested.
 I was just wondering what would happen when the DC in the secondary site can&#x27;t reach the DC&#x27;s in the primary site and vice versa. What would happen if there are some actions to be done at the DC in the secondary site during the business continuity test, like password resets, GPO changes etc. Will the changes sync without issues to the DC&#x27;s at the primary site when the connection is restored? Not planning on doing modifications though, just in case. 
 No Active Directory Sites &amp; Services configured, I know, it&#x27;s on the todo list :)

                              <span>Hey guys,
 as the title suggests, I would need to disable all kinds of anti spam measures for ONE mail adress in Exchange online, because Microsoft marks a lot of incoming as spam. Best way to approach this?
 Thanks already.

                              <span>So I have been looking into upgrading our systems from RC4 encryption to AES-256. The first time I turned it on it broke everything. DC&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t talk to each other at all. It was my first truly oh shit moment. Took down the company for 3 hours. Today I got sometime to go back and start looking at the issue . The password for the krbtgt account has not been reset in about 8 years. When I run the klist command it shows AES-256 connection from and to every machine I have looked at. The only exceptions is the krbtgt and our QNAP device. QNAP will be something I look at afterwards. We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time there. Anyhow, my thinking is it is still using RC4 because that was the last time the account had its password reset and to move it up to AES-256 the password needs to be reset. 
 ​
 Can anyone confirm if my thinking is right?
 I&#x27;ve been told by multiple people that resetting the password for the krbtgt account has not caused any problems. Has anyone had any issues with this?

 So patching up openSSL on linux servers were pretty easy. But i have not found a way to easily deploy it to Windows servers.
  
 Have anyone found an easy way to mitigate the vulnerabilities? Or do i have to go full on manual installation.

 During the initial conversations between us and them, all of a sudden our emails stopped being received. We informed them of such and did some investigations on our side.
 Initial investigations showed that WTHlogistics had 3 published MX records. 
 20 mailgate.wthlogistics.com 25 mailgate2.wthlogistics.com 30 wthlogistics.mail.protection.outlook.com 
 It appeared that our mailhost started sending mail to priority 30, which is then being accepted by the server, but then is not being forwarded on to their mailbox, so we politely informed them of this…</span>

As soon as I saw the participants I knew I was in trouble. I had about 15 minutes to fret so I wrote down some questions and did some deep breathing exercises. 
 I log into the teams meeting and there is my old boss whom I’ve known for about 18 years looking ghost white with blood shot eyes. He’s been a mentor to me for many years at times more like a brother than a boss. We have been through thick and thin and both survived numerous layoffs. He had to break the news that my company was letting go a large number of people across the board to reduce cost in light of inflation, rising material costs, supply chain issues, etc. My last day will be December 31st.

 While there are many guides that tell you how to do this, Nearly all of them seems to be relying on 3rd party software.
 I would like to create this drive using only builtin Windows tools, I have already done it with a MDT image so im hoping it can be done similarily with other images.

                              <span>So we recently bought a lot of different laptops. All brand new medium range dell/hp/lenovo.
 Some came with a usb c charger, others with the standard 19v brick. We had 2 very similar hp models with the only difference being the size but one came with a usb-c charger and the other one didn&#x27;t. 
 Why? Why are they still using custom 19v chargers when all of them are capable of charging through usb-c... 
 Sorry for this rant. It just annoys me that i need to have 10 different spares instead of a single standardised one.

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m a sysadmin at a big healthcare provider in the UK. 
 Our tools are showing &quot;brute force attack&quot; alerts because thousands of accounts in AD are being locked out. And i&#x27;m talking sometimes a dozen lockouts per account per day. 
 But here&#x27;s the kicker - we have no login failures. So there are no failed logins at all for 99% of the affected accounts. 
 We have no idea what is triggering the account lockouts. The source of the account lockouts is showing a web server we use for the website, so we were considering whether its AD-integrated web server which is causing the issue, but its also showing thousands of account lockouts originating from dozens of other assets/servers in the network. 
 We have a decent sized team looking at it but we&#x27;re coming up with nothing. 
 Any ideas here?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I wanted to send notifications from Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.
 I created a new azure user ie.: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com).
 I added this user to the group which exclude the user from any Conditional Access settings.
 I created NewSMTPBasic authentication policy (AllowBasicAuthSmtp true) and assigned it to the user
 I setup SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled : False 
 My settings of Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows are 
 smtp server: smtp.office365.com
 email: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 port: 587
 SSL/TLS: Yes
 user to authenticate: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 Password: password of [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com) 
 My problem is that it works only with above settings. If I want to change email address to any email like: [djwheele@domain.com](mailto:djwheele@domain.com), [anymail@domain.com](mailto:anymail@domain.com), any existing users in our domain it doesn&#x27;t work. 
 Did You ever had similar issue? Can You help me to solve it? Why I can send emails only to the user who is used to authenticate on smtp.office365.com ???? 
 Thank You in advance.

 Language barrier isn&#x27;t the problem - I can appreciate that they probably aren&#x27;t speaking English as a 1st or even a 2nd language, but much of the time it genuinely feels like pulling teeth.

                              <span>Apologies if this is the wrong place to be asking this question, but it is my first time seeing this issue before thought I would try my luck here.
 We have an on-prem environment using a local domain - just a standard dc server with AD and a RDS server - User1 is already logged on to the RDS server. Then User2 comes in to start their day logs into a Windows 10 PC which is domain joined and receives &quot;Welcome User1&quot; in the windows login greeting and User1 is then disconnected from their RDS session and User2 has actually loaded User1&#x27;s profile - desktop icons and all.
 Any ideas what may be causing this, I have tried the following:
 -Removed User1 and User2&#x27;s profiles from the Windows 10 PC and then re-added only User2 back on to the device but the issue is still occurring - User 1 no longer uses the Windows 10 PC just works on the RDS.
 -Removed the Windows 10 PC from the domain and re-joined to the domain. The RDS server itself is new only a month or two old has been happening ever since the RDS server was setup I was informed.
 any further suggestions on what else we can try here? - getting close to the too much time wasted - blow away windows and reinstall and see if it happens again.

                              <span>Hello,
 i&#x27;m having a issue regarding Skype accounts. We are currently working with Microsoft teams but all our suppliers (based in Vietnam and India) are using Skype personal.
 We can&#x27;t use our teams account to skype to them but we also can&#x27;t create a &quot;personal&quot; skype account beceause we have teams accounts...
 i would like to prevent to have users create skype accounts with their personal emails... how can i create a &quot;personal&quot; skype account with a &quot;business&quot; email adress.
 (FYI: Skype is still beeing heavily used at our suppliers)
 Thank you for the input and feedback!

 Does it need moving? (I don&#x27;t see any chatter about moving such a thing when Googling) or destroying and recreating? What does that mean for the existing MSAs?
 your responses always greatly appreciated

                              <span>I work at a company with a good MDM solution, they don&#x27;t want people using their personal, unregistered devices to access work email. Normally this works out fine and they get a &quot;blocked&quot; message when the mobile browser is detected.
 But recently a loophole was discovered - on Android phones at least, users have the ability to trick the system by enabling desktop mode and then logging in through 2 factor.
 This is possible because getting into email by 2 factor through personal computers is allowed. But we don&#x27;t want people on their phones doing it, otherwise what&#x27;s the point of using an MDM? This loophole was discovered only on Android but it&#x27;s possible it exists on iPhones too.

                              <span>Kinda lost on this one.
 A friend asked why when they google their website, when someone clicks the link for website on the right hand side (not the google returned link on the left) it redirects to a rotating spam URL for prescription viagra pills. If you browse to the URL manually and then click the website link on the right, it will redirect properly from that point on.
 If you click the returned website on the left it correctly goes to the site. Ping the address and it returns the correct IP as recorded in the ICANN lookup.
 Any suggestions? Site is hosted through GoDaddy and I have no admin controls, just a friend asking for help.

 I am trying to do redirection using iptables. The number one problem is that local connections do not go through the PREROUTING chain in nat. I also suspect that they bypass the nat table altogether because none of the connections are reaching my rules in nat. 
 Is it possible to redirect traffic from the filter table instead of the nat table? 
 Before I started, I was worried about redirect loops but now I&#x27;ll be happy if I get a redirect loop.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I was recently hired to a small company as the sole IT guy. I&#x27;ve had about two years of non-traditional Helpdesk experience at a different company handling their proprietary machines and software.
 The company I&#x27;m at now has about ~60 devices exclusively on MAC OS and no MDM, administrative directory or cybersecurity solutions in place. They want me to come up with a solution for phishing and other threats. I did some research on MDMs like Jamf Pro in conjunction with Apple Business Manager. I&#x27;ve also looked a bit at Barracuda for phishing. I&#x27;ve figured an MDM would be a good starting point but apparently need a strong knowledge-base to implement (lest I break something) along with some scripting.
 I&#x27;m honestly not really sure what direction to go in. Any resources for learning how to implement an MDM for Mac OS if this is the best route? Other suggestions?

Summary
From mid-June through mid-July 2022, CISA conducted an incident response engagement at a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) organization where CISA observed suspected advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. In the course of incident response activities, CISA determined that cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence. CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that the FCEB network was compromised by Iranian government-sponsored APT actors.

                              <span>Im trying to find the best way to setup a site to site vpn using two unifi gateways. The problem is one gateway is behind starlink so it has cgnat. What is the best solution for this? Is it possible with just the unifi gateways or will another piece of equipment need to be involved. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a &quot;flow&quot; type as well as a &quot;ip_flow_start&quot; and &quot;ip_flow_end&quot;. The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)
 As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. 
 I don&#x27;t think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.
 Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?

                              <span>Hey everyone! I posted about this a couple months ago when I was trying to get the hardware, but now that I&#x27;ve had everything in my hands and have been trying to work with it, I&#x27;m stuck. I&#x27;ve literally been trying for 2 months. We currently have 2 TRENDnet TFC-110 MSTs that link our two buildings together using fiber. With the help of some others on Reddit, I purchased these two items (https://www.fs.com/products/11774.html and https://www.fs.com/products/43465.html). I got 3 of each to have backups in case one went bad. My Unifi switches recognize both SFP modules, but I cannot get the two switches to talk to each other with the fiber line that works just fine with the TRENDnet modules. Does anyone have ideas? I&#x27;ve tried everything I know (switching the fiber connections, restarting switches, changing cables/modules) and I&#x27;m stumped. Thanks!

 Now, this hasn&#x27;t always been going on, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure what changed to make it begin popping up, but it&#x27;s causing a lot of issues with our AnyConnect Management Tunnel connections, as the mgmt tunnel will not even attempt to connect if the credentials prompt is up. Once you &quot;x&quot; out of the prompt, the mgmt tunnel connects immediately.
 Has anyone else run into this?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have some later generation Extreme BOSS switches with multi-link trunking or MLT downstream to some VMWare ESXi servers. We have four links from the switch to one of our servers for instance.
 Are we supposed to ONLY configure trunks (no other LAG/LACP/MLT) downstream to these hypervisors? I noticed we have an exponential amount of broadcasts coming in from these MLT downstream switchports.
 IE on Cisco: conf t int fa0/1 switchport trunk encap dot1q switchport mode trunk
 We don&#x27;t have a distributed vSwitch connecting to these switches.

                              <span>Hi, everyone I’m new to this sub and I’m just wondering if anybody is able to give me some advice on how to basically convince my boss to promote me from field tech to UC engineer. They have been looking for someone for about a year now, they hired someone recently but it didn’t work out at all, the guy did not know what he was doing so the position is back open. Put IT dept is finally getting rid off a lot of old and slow programs and I believe with me being young and eager to solve problems and make everyone life easier I should be a good fit. I’m just wondering what type of skills or metrics to look at I should bring to my boss to convince him on giving me the job. I already got Azure cert and I work Cisco devices all day so I know those.
 I want to bring these tools that I believe can help me do the job.

 To me it seems like cloud, automation and security are the big 3, but I&#x27;m more interested in discussion about tangible skills or tech instead of broad strokes, like just generally saying cloud. Stuff like more using Ansible to create vendor neutral configs or using Grafana to create single pane of glass dashboards.

                              <span>Got 3 iSCSI hosts and 2 clients using 2x mpio over two switches. We don&#x27;t have any VM OSes stored on them, just file, backup and archive storage. Used what I had which were cheap Netgear switches and now I&#x27;ve had to reboot a switch again due to a port or two locking up after 9 months of service. It is now unreliable and I need a replacement suggestion. Would like to go for 10G copper even though we have nothing with 10G just to be prepared. $2k budget each, 16 port or more. Nothing fancy. Don&#x27;t need managed/L3/redundant PSU/etc. Max switching traffic at full load would be 2Gbps/ea but backups never run during business hours so it&#x27;s unrealistic.
 I dug around for a bit. Is the Aruba 1960 any good for light iSCSI?

                              <span>Very simple question. Currently in my environment we have loopback address assigned to each our routes/switches and our routing protocol is BGP. It was my understanding that you want a loopback address to be passive. Is this only the case if you are using OSPF to form an adjacency with other device or is it best practice to do reguardless of the routing protocol?

 Thanks!

 For you seasoned architects and engineers. How would you go about gathering information regarding the topology, routing, documentation if this was you?

 Have and of you guys been able to keep your job after screwing up like that?
 Update: thanks for all the responses! I&#x27;m feeling better about the whole situation now, we&#x27;re able to laugh about it more here at the office. I&#x27;m not gonna get fired and I&#x27;m definitely not gonna make the same mistake again lol

                              <span>Hey everyone.
 I&#x27;ve been googling around searching for what would be the most practical solution to monitor our 6 /24 segments but I haven&#x27;t found a definite answer. (We&#x27;re a new and kinda small ISP).
 I&#x27;ve already set up a remote server that is monitoring these segments with Smokeping, but now we need a way to monitor them locally.
 I haven&#x27;t found any info indicating that you can configure Smokeping to use a different interface or to ping with all interfaces, so, the faster solution would be to set up one Smokeping instance per each of our segments?
 Does anyone know a tool or service that could do this?
 Sorry if my English is a bit clunky, it is not my first language.
 Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: I just need basic ping and packet loss monitoring, like ping to Google, AWS, Netflix, Facebook, etc.
 nothing more at the moment.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a problem with Azure Virtual WAN routing and was hoping somebody might have some insight. I also posted to /r/Azure but did not get any replies.
 For testing, I have created a network described by the network diagram at https://imgur.com/a/Yf0INds . In my scenario, I am creating a traffic flow from VNet_1 to 10.200.0.10. BGP is used between the VPN Branches and the VirtualHubs.
  
At first, the traffic flow uses path 1. This is expected.
 If path 1 becomes unavailable then the traffic flow uses path 2. This is expected.
 If path 1 recovers then the traffic flow continues to use path 2. This is not expected.
  
My expectations are mostly based on the routing scenarios from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference . My understanding is that path 1 should always be preferred if it is available because the Virtual Hub will prefer a directly connected route over a route from a remote hub. I would at least expect the routing decision to be deterministic.

                              <span>When deploying a firewall in a datacenter or even at an office (around 300 people or so), do you put the layer 3 for the lans on the firewall or keep it on the switches but still have the firewall learn all the VLANs downstream?
 I am wondering if there is best practice when it comes to firewall deployment or is it whatever makes sense to you.
 For much smaller deployments, such as an office with 100 users or less, to me, it makes sense to just terminate on the firewall but then again im not concerned so much about the inter-vlan traffic and the firewall policies are a bit more lax compared to a datacenter rollout.

                              <span>Looking for advice on how to resolve this dilemma, and thought it best to include a diagram that shows the current topology:
 https://i.imgur.com/Id3NwcL.png
 I recently added a second nexus to our core. For WAN connectivity, we have one MPLS link from the carrier plugged into the original Nexus. This nexus is learning the BGP routes from our remote sites just fine.
 The second Nexus, however, is not. Instead, it is learning the routes from the firewall via OSPF, as each site has a VPN tunnel to the firewall as a backup WAN connection.
 Is it possible for nexus2 to receieve the BGP routes from nexus1 in the short term? Ideally, we would get a second drop from the carrier to have an uplink in nexus2, and they could also establish it as a bgp peer.
 Otherwise, what are my options?
 I could add static routes for each remote subnet on nexus2, but that doesn&#x27;t seem ideal, either.
 Right now, the bgp config on nexus1 is as follows:
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/24 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 address-family ipv4 unicast soft-reconfiguration inbound always 
 And Nexus2, I configured bgp in case I ever needed to physically move the MPLS cable over.
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/16 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 update-source Vlan999 address-family ipv4 unicast prefix-list no-default-route in router ospf 1 redistribute bgp 999 route-map MPLS passive-interface default redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS route-map MPLS permit 10 match route-type external internal

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently just messing around with some network traffic of an infusion pump and it&#x27;s connection with the online configurator. The two are exchanging their communication via TCP. 
 I also did a vulnerability scan using GVM/OpenVAS and found out that the infusion pump is using an old/deprecated version of TLS (version 1.0).
 Now the data that is being exchanged is send in plain text (also a lot of sensitive data) despite TLS.
 I&#x27;m kinda new to networking and the whole security aspect that does with it so excuse my ignorance. However, shouldn&#x27;t the data be encrypted in some sort because of the TLS that is implemented? The way i understand TLS is that the data is being encrypted right before it is being send over the TCP-Stream and then again decrypted at the destination.
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 entry P1_MCAST_V111 { if { vlan-id 111; } then { permit; replace-dot1p-value 4; } } 
 Recently I created a link aggregation group consisting of two ports. According to the docs, VLANs should be assigned only to the master port, but what about access lists? Should they also be assigned only to the master port or to both the slave and the master?

                              <span>Hi, so besides Draw.io or Visio, what tools do people use?
 I&#x27;ve tried using Visio and it&#x27;s fine but I feel like the diagrams just aren&#x27;t as professional compared to some of the diagrams you lookup or see elsewhere.
 I&#x27;ve heard that MAC&#x27;s have great tools for network documentation but sadly I&#x27;ve never used a MAC.
 If you could list your top 3 best network documentation tools you use, what would they be?
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m a bit of a beginner so was hoping to get some pointers on how to achieve the below please. Apologies if my question appears ignorant. Any input at all would be greatly appreciated.
 I am looking for a way to streamline some aspects of my job by doing some remote commissioning of PLCs, BACnet gateways, Modbus devices etc.
 While I am completing these works at the moment, the site is typically under construction, so there is no internet access or core switch operational. I have to manually plug into network switches around the the site and configure devices that way.
 I have got my hands on a cellular 3G router and have got it configured so I can use it to remotely connect to a site PC via RDP and use that for remote commissioning.
 What I would like to achieve is being able to plug this 3G router in to any isolated network switch on site and be able to connect to and pull data from devices such as the PLCs and gateways dynamically and communicate with a remote PC rather than a local RDP.
 Ideal setup would be:
  
Remote PC at home (192.168.xxx.xxx)
 3G router plugged into switch on site (10.10.xxx.xxx)
 Applications on Remote PC at home able to communicate with IP devices plugged in to network switch on site (For example opening my PLC configuration program and plugging in the 10.10.xxx.xxx IP Address to be able to configure it remotely.
  
I have got the dynamic DNS side of things working and am aware I can set up specific connections via port forwarding, but I am looking for a more dynamic solution where someone on site can plug this router into any switch on site and I will be able to talk to any of the 10.10.xxx.xxx devices dynamically without having to set up dedicated port forwarding for each unique IP address.
 Is a solution like this feasible, or should I continue with the site laptop/3G router combo I am currently using for remote access via RDP?
 Appreciate your time and input.

 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.117.1.1.1.1.1.15 &#x3D; INTEGER: 2 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.117.1.1.1.1.2.15 &#x3D; STRING: &quot;centiAmpsAt12V&quot; SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.117.1.1.1.1.3.15 &#x3D; INTEGER: 11333 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.117.1.1.1.1.4.15 &#x3D; INTEGER: 9683 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.117.1.1.1.1.5.15 &#x3D; INTEGER: 2 
 Any help would be great.
 Thanks

                              <span>Is it normal for enterprise sized companies 10k+ employees , 300+ IT staff not to have IT project managers? 
 I work in a 50,000+ employee company with projects galore and no IT project managers. Each IT person has projects where they are the lead on. I personally have 10 large projects to manage and it’s chaos. I get constantly pulled into other peoples project meetings while trying to pull what ever resources I can into my projects. This leads to a stupid amount of unproductive meetings, no ownership, and nothing getting done. 
 I’ve told my managers they need to get some project managers on board, but am met with looks of bewilderment. Is this standard operating procedure at most large organizations?

 What does everyone do to minimize lost time on BS user issues? I feel like my important tasks are always put on the back burner due to the constant interruptions. 
 I&#x27;m a one man show. I do have the support of a MSP available and their usage approved, but is that additional expense warranted? It&#x27;s a small company but I&#x27;m managing their entire tech stack. So far I haven&#x27;t used the MSP for the help desk. Should I start? 
 I&#x27;m trying to juggle important changes to systems that will impact the efficiencies elsewhere in the organization but I end up spending my day diagnosing a printer that a user disconnected. WTH?

 Make sure you enter SLA request tickets as if you experienced this. That broke their SLA, and here&#x27;s the downtime description, &quot;Downtime: Any period of time when end users are unable to see presence status, conduct instant messaging conversations, or initiate online meetings.&quot; 
 As of this writing we&#x27;re at about 99.35 (which is less than 99.9%) - so we&#x27;re at 25% service credit but if they hit 99% that&#x27;s 50% service credit.

I thought that was some funny as shit.

I just wanted to share a funny work place story that happened today!

                              <span>This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m happy.
 We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it&#x27;s a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he&#x27;s giving me a 5, and they just say &quot;We&#x27;re good with that. Who&#x27;s next.&quot;
 After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.
 Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don&#x27;t want to deal with it in the morning.
 So, in a month, I don&#x27;t work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I&#x27;ll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.
 So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it&#x27;s really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you&#x27;ll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you&#x27;re everyone&#x27;s hero. And they&#x27;ll remember you&#x27;re the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.
 It&#x27;s good to be recognized sometimes.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve recently deployed Ubiquity Dream Machines at one of the locations I&#x27;m responsible for, and among other websites they want to see blocked, TikTok and 4chan are at the top. 
 Despite entering domain names, and in the case of TikTok, all of the many IP addresses, it still seems accessible. Even the &quot;Social Media&quot; catch all option is not blocking it in the Traffic Management section. 
 Does anyone else have any experience or ideas on how to do this? The domains and IPs suggested online haven&#x27;t been useful. I&#x27;m at the point where I will have to purchase additional software like openDNS, which is fine if that&#x27;s what is necessary, but I was hoping to avoid.

 According to the article, someone &#x27;high up&#x27; clicked on a bad link and it led to everything from their backups to payroll, scheduling, inventory, ordering and many other systems all being compromised. They also lost patient pharmaceutical info to the attackers.
 For this to be true it means a number of the most basic industry standard security practices were not followed, like:
  
MFA/Conditional access on remote access to email, VPN, RDP, etc...
 No separation of regular user accounts from admin, server and domain admin accounts
 Backups not immutable or air gapped
 Likely no &#x27;next gen&#x27; firewall UTM monitoring internal servers
  
It also just seems crazy to me that so many systems could be accessible from a single user credential. This is a company that had $30 billion+ in sales last year.

 I’m writing a resume for an AD specialist position and it’s crazy to list and remember all the big and small projects across my 20 in the business.

                              <span>So I am an intern, this is my first IT job. My ticket was migrating our email gateway away from going through Sophos Security to now use native Defender for Office because we upgraded our MS365 License. Ok cool. I change the MX Records in our multiple DNS Providers, Change TXT Records at our SPF tool, great. Now Email shouldn&#x27;t go through Sophos anymore. Send a test mail from my private Gmail to all our domains, all arrive, check message trace, good, no sign of going through Sophos. 
 Now im deleting our domains in Sophos, delete the Message Flow Rule, delete the Sophos Apps in AAD. Everything seems to work. Four hours later, I&#x27;m testing around with OME encryption rules and send an email from the domain to my private Gmail. Nothing arrives. Fuck. 
 I tested external -&gt; internal and internal -&gt; internal, but didn&#x27;t test internal-&gt; external. Message trace reveals it still goes through the Sophos Connector, which I forgot to delete, that is pointing now into nothing. 
 Deleted the connector, it&#x27;s working now. Used Message trace to find all mails in our Org that didn&#x27;t go through and individually PMed them telling them to send it again. It was a virtual walk of shame. Hope I&#x27;m not getting fired.

                              <span>Right now we have identified many different scripting/coding methods being used to automate processes like reporting, database updates, account modifications, SharePoint updates, and much more. Things like PowerShell (.ps1), Batch files (.bat/.cmd), Shell scripts (.sh), Perl scripts (.pl), Autohotkey scripts (.ahk), Python (.py), complex Excel/Access creations, SharePoint forms/automations, and custom executables from god knows where (.exe).
 Everyone who came before was handed multiple jobs to complete, as their peers left the company. And they managed to do it. They automated it to make it possible. But then they were poorly compensated. No raises, or even pay cuts. CEO makes 2 mil, yet they get dropped from 100k to 70k to make it happen. So they left. Now the company is relying on this automation, but it keeps breaking. Nobody has expertise to deal with so many different cobbled together pieces. They basically eliminated 20+ jobs through automation, then let the people behind all this stuff walk. We&#x27;re not even sure which servers it&#x27;s all running on (dozens of them at least).
 Any recommendations for dealing with this stuff (other than leaving)?
 Any tools that can log all of this, and try to map out what everything is doing, and on what servers?

                              <span>Basically we have a web application that all of our suppliers log into and do certain things for us. All of a sudden last week something changed and our users are having difficulties logging in. They are getting all kinds of TLS and connection refused errors. It works intermittently but when they are able to log in, page elements don&#x27;t load, it says quotes are submitted when they actually aren&#x27;t.
 It&#x27;s extremely old obviously, it can only run in edge on compatibility mode now, it was originally designed for Internet explorer. The kicker is that there&#x27;s been no maintenance paid on this and it cannot be updated without that maintenance, and the person who created it left the company 10 years before I joined. I asked around and there&#x27;s nobody that supports this app nor has there been anybody since the man who created it left supporting it.
 Now I have procurement beating down my door in a panic because nobody can do what they need to do. I told them I have no knowledge of this and that the solution is to cough up the maintenance to get this working but I was told that isn&#x27;t an option. My job duties do not include application support. I am a systems administrator. 
 I&#x27;m all for helping out where I can but what do I do?

                              <span>They have altered the file naming in AppData/Roaming. A template named head.office used to get you files named head.office_files, head_office.htm, head.office.rtf, head.office.txt 
 If your template or signature is still named head.office, the associated files now have the user appended ... head_office (user@domain.tld)_files, head_office (user@domain.tld).htm, etc ....
 Hopefully this means they are progressing with server-wide signatures (once for all devices).

 ​
 We&#x27;d like to replace our on-prem server monitoring system with a service based solution. We need to be able to monitor/alert on specific Windows services, network ports, MS-SQL triggers (resource usage, database availability, etc), server utilization and WIM.
 ​
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a way to sign subdomains as well with the same key?
 Ie.:
 foo.com
 *.foo.com
 I can&#x27;t find out how to do it and I&#x27;m starting to believe it&#x27;s just not possible.
 We just can&#x27;t set &quot;Domain&quot; parameter in opendkim.conf because we are sending emails with hunderds if not thousands of domains.
 rspamd is not an option because it&#x27;s too heavy weight (slows down the mail delivery singificantly at this scale of emails).

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Every couple of months we need to update some image files on 150 remote windows machines (not on the company network). Right now we have been doing it manually: using TeamViewer or VNC to remote into the machine and transfer the files. Is there any tool/software that can allow me to script the entire process so we don&#x27;t have to do this anymore? Thanks!

                              <span>So I had an interview with a recruitment agency today, was a general chat with the usual personality questions, from the junior consultant girl. Followed up with some more technical networking/infra questions from the senior interviewer. 
 Long story short, the senior said she&#x27;s probably got something VMWare lined up with a 3-6 month contract, and will called back tomorrow with a series of technical questions. I am a systems/network administrator with proficient L1-L2 experience, and even build servers both physical and virtual from the ground up, utilizing technologies such as Hyper-V and VMware on the occasional blue moon, or when the need arises. I have been doing this for roughly 10 years. 
 Now I understand while the market is pretty good for IT jobs at the moment, I can&#x27;t seem to get over the fact, that all these high level engineering questions get thrown at you, or something that is super specific to the business. Half the time it&#x27;s not even listed on the job advert and here I am thinking yep, a suitable sysadmin role only to be thrown curveball after curveball of things non related to original advert, or what&#x27;s listed on my resumé.
 Does anyone else experience these sorts of things in the application process and what sort of questions should I expect tomorrow? She knows I&#x27;m not VMWare certified but still stated that an 80% success on the questions will land me the job!!! 80%!!!

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 My environment consists of ten terminals and two file servers in different sites.
 The file server consists of drives:
 D-data
 P - fslogix profiles disks
 L - logs for storage replica
 All on OS server 2019
 ​
 During business hours I ran the test-srtopology command and then the entire network was disabled.
 I guess it happened during the ICMP traffic test or during perfomance tests.
 I honestly couldn&#x27;t find and understand why it affected the entry to the terminals.
 Because I performed the replication in general on a different drive from the profiles, I ran the test and the command on drive D.
 The logic says that there is no effect on the function but the facts show that the problem started close to the time I was working on the file server with the command I explained earlier.
 And the problem was solved when it was over.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help in understanding this, what was the problem?
 And is the storage replica solution suitable for file servers with a function like mine.
 Drive D contains regular files and documents.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>We have a lot of team co-ordinators and PA&#x27;s who have to cover for each other on a regular basis &amp; what this usually means is that calendar delegate settings are having to be adjusted all the time. Providing a user with delegate access using Powershell and the cmdlet SharingPermissonFlags is straight forward enough, the issue is then removing those permissions consistently. Getting access to a VIP&#x27;s Outlook profile to remove delegate access manually isn&#x27;t always convenient. Is there a way of removing delegate permissions through poweshell, so that the delegate no longer receives calendar invites?

                              <span>Hi all,
 The short text on this post is that I&#x27;ve been exploring backup options, we&#x27;re currently an Acronis house for on-prem backups, and I&#x27;ve lost the will to live looking at a 300% jump in costs if we want to implement backups for the ~8TB data we have in 365 through mailboxes, SharePoint and OneDrive. 
 We&#x27;re a nonprofit, and our 1.5 FTE staff in IT are supported by an MSP who want to resell us Veeam. We have Synology NAS for storing VM and database backups, distributed across 4 sites. I&#x27;m told the Synology 365 solution sucks but it&#x27;s basically free. I want to save £5k a year by using it anyway. I&#x27;m looking for more impartial opinions than I&#x27;ve been given so far.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>working for a small start up company with about 130 users. 
 Main problem i am faced with currently is tidying up the current AAD estate. 
 All applications are assigned directly to users in AAD rather than through groups, the problem i currently have is; 
 I want to assign applications through groups such as (Core Apps, Engineering, QA, Customer Ops) groups based on departments/roles within the business which will help in me automating application access. 
 My main concern currently is all the applications assigned directly to existing users, I wanted to avoid doubling up giving access but I&#x27;m struggling to think of a way to put everyone into groups, giving them the access they need and not creating duplicates. 
 Of course there&#x27;s the manual route which I&#x27;m happy to do but will be kicking myself if there&#x27;s an easier way to do it and i find out after. 
 Any advice or comments on me being an idiot are fully welcomed :&#x27;)

                              <span>Hi all,
 I know some people will defend the foreman with their live, but lets be honest:
 The thing is constantly broken. I tried using rhel sattelite, but I don&#x27;t want to buy a new license this year.
 Does anyone know a working alternative (preferable with a gui)? I want to auto-create a VM on my vmware infra structure and deploy an OS

                              <span>Given the “end of the tech boom,” and companies like Meta, Twitter and now Amazon letting go of a mass number of employees in a short period, I’m interested to see how these companies will manage their offboarding. What systems/processes would you put in place? 
 I.e. would you gift their laptops or pick them up? How would you pick them up if mainly remote employees? If gifted, what are the security risks? I know so many people who were left with blank, locked/unusable new laptops when they left their company. Seems such a waste, especially given the supply issues atm. 
 I’m new to all this, so I’d love to have some ideas in my back pocket just in case something like this were to happen at my company.

 I am salaried.

                              <span>Hi guys, we&#x27;ve got a Ruckus Virtual SmartZone Essentials box and for staff/student WIFI we use Radius to authenticate with a DC NPS server which then assigns a VLAN to route through the appropriate filter on our Sophos XGS.
 It works, but is a nasty experience, especially on Android where the user has to choose encryption type (LEAP, PEAP etc) and certificate - with Google Pixel not working at all. On desktop and Apple devices it&#x27;s tidier just taking the username and password.
 I&#x27;m being sold CloudPath as a solution but I just can&#x27;t wrap my head around why I need an extra product.
 I&#x27;ve managed to get a landing page to authenticate to AD which works OK, except for all the certificate errors for the Ruckus landing page and then for XGS.
 Anyone got an idiots guide on how to improve this or am I going to have to fork out for a proper onboarding solution?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Our Commvault 5 year deal is coming to an end.
 I&#x27;m not in that company so ling, so I inherited it with the job.
 It&#x27;s going to end in about 5 months and I was considering my options.
 I&#x27;ve been working with veeam before, so I am familiar with it, but also considering 2 more vendors, veratis and rubrik.
 I was wondering if anyone can offer some technical tips in 2 scopes:
  
Things to check when look for a solution, like deduplication and encryption for example 
 
Comparison with the vendors I mentioned from your experience. 
 
 My current setting in comvault is with a dell scv2020 and a server connecting the storge (called media agent).
 For comvault renewal I&#x27;ve been notified the server won&#x27;t be needed anymore but the storage is out of service.
 I can get 3rd party support for the storage, using it for a few more years and saving costs but I understand other vendors has their own appliances with internal storage and such, that will probably cost more to implement then using the storage I have now.
 I mostly backup DB, important data server and our vcenter.
 Also backing up to cloud, using metallic. 
 Any advises?

 I work at an org that has windows hello / face ID enabled for log in. This is causing a nightmare for the service desk because end users keep forgetting their password as face ID is just too convenient...
 Is there any sort of group policy or other setting we can change so our devices forcefully require the password to be entered once every 10 log ins instead of face ID?
 Cheers

                              <span>I’ve always loved linux and networking since I was a kid in highschool. My greatest project at that time was putting msfconsole on a jailbroken iPad mini. This project took me 2 weeks to complete (slacked off about half those days) but once finished it gave me biggest rush to see msfconsole load up, even if I did absolutely nothing with it. I knew I had to do this for a living. 
 fast forward, graduate college with a BS associates in computer programing because I hate school and couldn’t beat another 2 years. Finally get my degree at 20 and what do I do with it? Nothing. For 3 years. Since out of highschool I worked BS manual labor jobs. I always knew I wanted more, but didn’t think my degree would get me anything. Until 6 months ago. 
 Now, by pure luck, I’m a tier 1 sysadmin (skipped help desk completely) at a VoIP company, writing a script to fully automate the setup of a wireless modem in a fanless PC, to cut a two box implementation down to 1, and simplify the process for those who need to install the equipment. 
 Pinch me I’m dreaming. 
 There’s nothing like the feeling of rebooting a device, watching your logs show you over and over again a successful setup, and knowing the months it took to make this happen resulted in a (somewhat) stable configuration.

                              <span>I know what some might say right away, imposter syndrome, etc, and there might be some of that.
 But in other real ways I’m not good enough at my job and it’s hurting me, hurting the clients, and hurting the customers.
 There’s really two problems: one is that I’m tech-savvy and have a real knack for this stuff, but past a certain level of technical difficulty and outside of a certain level of emergency I lose focus and falter in knowledge. Like, if the server is down right now, I can figure outa way to get it back up. I might not be able to articulate how, but I’ll get it running again. But ask me to troubleshoot what happened after the fact and I’ll flounder. Similarly if you give me a bunch of machines and an end result, I can get them running… but are they configured correctly, or do they just “kinda work”?
 The second is I really have a hard time working hard enough or doing the work I need to be doing. If I don’t have a person calling now, I try to go to my ticket queue, and I can sit and stare at tickets or click in and out of them multiple times without doing anything. And that’s if I don’t give in to the temptation do something else entirely. I’ve blocked Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook on work computers during the day, and it helps, but I can still find ways to not do work. I have things that sit in a queue for days or weeks because I get so anxious I avoid them until I can’t any longer.
 I’m failing the rest of my team, and I feel like shit all the time about it. And that just makes it worse.
 I think about jumping ship to another job, but I actually like the company and people I work for, and I know it would only help for six months to a year, and I’d be right back where I started.
 I don’t know, this may not be the place to talk about this, this is less a technical conversation than maybe mental health mixed with discipline, but maybe some of you have some advice to help me get back on track.

                              <span>I was using explorer patcher to move my taskbar to top successfully before 22H2. But yesterday my computer got updated and the taskbar went back down. So, I tried a bunch of stuff until I managed to get it back on top and, as I found this instruction nowhere, I share here in case someone needs it.
 The difference between this solution and the regular instruction I found around the internet is that they all suggest editing values of a &quot;MMStuckRects3&quot; key, which was working for me before 22H2, but not anymore. The hack is to add a new REG_BINARY to the registry key below (create if does not exist):
 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MMStuckRectsLegacy]
 The name of this new value must be the device instance path (second property when navigating to Devices Manager &gt; Monitors &gt; (target monitor name) &gt; Properties &gt; Device Instance Path). Get everything after &quot;DISPLAY\&quot; and replace the other &quot;\&quot; by &quot;#&quot;, such as:
  
Device Instance Path: DISPLAY\PHLC056\5&amp;3C07B47&amp;0&amp;UID266
 Registry key name: PHLC056#5&amp;3c07b47&amp;0&amp;UID266 (letters in lower case between # and &amp;UID)
  
Using this as the name of the value, enter the following binary value:
 30 00 00 00 fe ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 3e 00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
 Restart explorer.exe or sign out/in and the second monitor taskbar should be at the top.
 Hope it helps!

                              <span>Heading to work, got a call from boss, couple clients down, they can&#x27;t connect to data center. So I head straight there. 
 Checked firewall it&#x27;s online. Connect to win server, can&#x27;t login, that&#x27;s weird i thought to myself. Decide to login to hypervisor instead from my laptop, sees clients vm offline, tries to boot one, says cannot locate vm disk, my eyes bulge. At that point I&#x27;m like WTF. I browser to the location of the disk.... Everything encrypted with ransomware. My heart skips a beat and i nearly stumble. No worries, i told myself, I&#x27;ll just fire up the replicas on the backup and everyone back up.....WTF replica encrypted too. Dig deeper, entire datacenter compromised. 
 Esxi + ransomware &#x3D; how da hell that happen? Stuff like that will make a grown man want to cry. I literally have sleepless night and when i do sleep it give me nightmares

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a one man shop, size is not huge, but pace of company, red tape, etc make it a huge workload which I personally feel we need at least 3 people, but that&#x27;s a different story.
 The CFO is the one directly over my purchases.
 They&#x27;ve been on a hiring spree, like 10 people a month, but I feel there is very little communication between HR and them and most departments or they&#x27;re too busy to pay attention to what&#x27;s going on.
 So every time I make a purchase of those 10 laptops ahead of time, I&#x27;m given a very hard time and the CFO&#x27;s attitude acts like I&#x27;m just shopping or hoarding, or maybe worse, stealing. So I tell him about all these new hires, and they keep coming and he always gives me a hard time.
 This is in addition to equipment that needs to be refreshed or fails. He gives me such…</span>

                              <span>So every Monday, I have a reminder in Outlook to add a User back to her Microsoft Teams. Sometimes I get busy and forget and she sends a pleasant reminder via text. (No, seriously, it&#x27;s very pleasant and to the point).
 But within the next week, she will disappear from her team. 
 If it matters, this user was an active member of the organization back in 2019, left to have a baby, and just came back this past month. Her account was never removed. Her sign-in was rescinded and her mailbox was set to shared. When she got rehired, we just re-issued her a Business Standard License and set her mailbox back up. 
 But every Monday, when she opens her teams app, it shows her as &quot;not a member&quot; of any teams, and she&#x27;s not permitted to join any unless I go through the admin portal and do it. 
 ​
 What could I be missing? Should I just delete everything and recreate the user entirely to be rid of this headache?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sysadmin working as a 1 man dept for a smb with about 150 employees. I handle 6 sites, 3 being remote. I manage all our systems and network infrastructure, so I have a lot of things on my plate. Also another task I manage is helpdesk support, most of which is simple password resets and on/off-boarding of employees. 
 Here recently I&#x27;ve been getting overly frustrated with some of the dept heads, they are down my neck with anything and everything when something isn&#x27;t going properly with their employees (Always the same employee) computer, etc. It&#x27;s mostly their sarcastic tone and wording that makes it seem like I&#x27;m just licking my toes in my office. When In the last few weeks I&#x27;ve been getting things ready to switch out our core switches and 4 of our sites Cisco ASAs and moving to FortiGate. A lot of behind the scenes things they have 0 idea about and I don&#x27;t even waste my breath explaining.
 Starting to really regret this job and looking into moving to something more enterprise level and dealing with end-user support

                              <span>I had my renewal meeting today and I knew this was coming and was prepared for it. What I was not prepared for is that Veeam is actually charging a fee to migrate you from the Socket Model to the VUL Model. This fee is as much as my renewal. In what world does this make sense? We want to move folks to our new VUL (which will increase me $2K per year on its own) but we are going to make their renewal cost double to do it? So, you want me to pay a fee to pay you more? You would think they would SAVE you money year 1 to get you into the new model. I&#x27;m no rocket scientist, but what idiot approved this or thought this would fly with customers?
 I know Veeam is the best, blah blah blah, but this was a kick straight to the face and honestly is disgusting that they think this is acceptable. I haven&#x27;t considered a competitor in 10 years, but this &quot;fee&quot; is hard to ignore. I&#x27;d go with not Veeam out of principle at this point.

                              <span>Some of you might know the problem.
 You setup meeting rooms perfectly. Everything is working as expected.
 First meeting over, nothing&#x27;s working anymore.
 Cables are no longer in the ports where they belong etc.
 What solutions do you have?
 I am looking for some tools/utilities to connect stuff in a way it can&#x27;t be removed for example but still &quot;looks good&quot;.
 Can&#x27;t glue it :) Would look a bit strange. When i did some research on the net i wondered that i could not find a lot regarding this topic. I would assume this is something a lot of us have to struggle with?
 Any tips, hints, links?

                              <span>Is anyone else having as much trouble as I am? I have an AAS and BS and 11 years in the field. I&#x27;ve applied to over 100 jobs in the past month without a single offer. I have had several first interviews though. I&#x27;ve gotten positive feedback from the recruiter (feedback is from the hiring manager). One even said they decided they weren&#x27;t going to hire anyone immediately, but asked if they could call me back in a couple of months. I&#x27;ve had probably 10-15 recruiters reach out but the customer always chooses another candidate. My current job won&#x27;t let me stay on after I relocate in a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m starting to panic. If you have any suggestions, I&#x27;m open to them!

 If there is a better sub for this question please let me know.

                              <span>My company has used Teamviewer for over a decade. In that time they forced us to purchase not one, but two different so-called &quot;Lifetime licenses&quot;
 When purchasing the first license they failed to mention that when they upgraded their software they would push a new version to our clients before we could have a chance to stop it, and then almost immediately prevented us from connecting to our managed systems without first upgrading.
 After we purchased these &quot;lifetime&quot; licenses, they abruptly switched to a subscription model.
 The cost of that subscription has increased by about 100% in the last 4 years, and now they&#x27;ve implemented really low device limits!
 So not only has my cost doubled, I would have to purchase additional licensing just to keep managing the same number of computers I have managed all along.
 Save your money, go with another vendor!
 **Edit**
 After sending an email to the entire leadership at TV, expressing my amazement that they intended to try to extort a final year&#x27;s subscription from us, the very rude person I initially spoke to, that kept incorrectly asserting that we always had device limits on our account, called back to once again try to offer me discounts to keep me with their company.
 I thanked her for giving me content for my most popular reddit post ever, and read off the contracts from 2015 and later to her on the phone. Now they&#x27;re going to go ahead and cancel us without trying to forcibly renew. Pfft

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a simple question with a probably not so simple answer.
 We have an Out of Office calendar that I wanted to automate a bit more of so that after people submitted their OOO reason they didn&#x27;t have to manually categorize the event with a specific color.
 To do this, I created mail flow rules on the Room Resource inbox that applied categories based on subject line text. This is working, but comes with a side effect that the attendees are showing on the meeting subject - example below:
  
MySecretWork Account - WFH; Out of Office; MySecretWork Account
  
I already went into the room resource and adjusted the following settings:
  
Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity outofoffice@domain.com -DeleteSubject $False -AddOrganizerToSubject $False
  
This was done so that the subject line wouldn&#x27;t be replaced solely by the organizer&#x27;s name. Attendees are now showing up on calendar though, which adds a bunch of clutter to calendar.
 I just want the meeting requests on the Out of Office calendar to look like the below:
  
MySecretWork Account - WFH
  
No extra info - just the actual subject line of the meeting request.
 Is this possible? I didn&#x27;t see anything on the Set-CalendarProcessing documentation page, but if there is a setting elsewhere that can achieve this (either GUI or PowerShell) please let me know!

                              <span>The server runs nicely when it runs.
 Never a shutdown event recorded in Event Viewer. Never.
 After about 4 days, I simply find the server is off.
 The unit was a refurb purchased from Amazon. No support contract.
 As stated, Server 2019. 
 I&#x27;m accustomed to at least getting a Kernel Power event or &quot;something&quot;.
 Has anyone seen this type of behavior? Any ideas? I&#x27;m baffled.

Let me know if I&#x27;m missing a major mark.

 I&#x27;m currently trying to roll out Windows Hello for Business for a small set of users ( three users in total ). I used this deployment guide from Microsoft to set it up:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-deployment-cert-trust
 So far, I&#x27;ve been able to get 1 of the three workstations / users to successful be able to use Windows Hello for Business. The other two keeps showing that PIN and Facial Recognition are &quot;unavailable&quot;. What I can&#x27;t seem to find is a way to troubleshoot why these other two aren&#x27;t able to use the service. Does anyone know where I can start troubleshooting the issue and help to correct it? TIA

                              <span>Our domain controllers (Server 2016, no CIS benchmark applied) were updated last night with the November cumulative update KB5019964.
 Since then, our Server 2019 member servers in the domain can no longer contact the domain controllers for GPUpdate, kerberos authentication etc. nobody can login to the 2019 member servers or authenticate against them with their domain accounts and the network card/firewall no longer get the domain profile and instead get assigned the Private profile.
 We are deploying the v1.2.1 version of the CIS MS-L1 benchmark to all our 2019 servers succesfully since it was released without issue.
 Only since last night do we suddenly have an issue.
 Does anyone else have this issue or know what setting in the benchmark is now causing this issue?

 I recently changed a bunch of users UPN from [jd@domain.com](mailto:jd@domain.com) to [jd@dom.com](mailto:jd@dom.com) and now some of the users cannot log in to their PC, with the SAMAccountName.
 Their SAMAccountName would be something like domain\domjd
 Has anyone experienced something simular to this before?
 Is there perhaps some registry etc. that needs to be changed?

                              <span>so from the research i did ive learnt,
  
and anyone who has the exported PST file in their Pc, can import it to Outlook and use it that way.
 to use this feature you need to have some specific license For the organization account first and another license specific license for the user account
 Exchange online Plan 2, Microsoft 365 E3, Office 365 E3 or anything higher will do for the org account
 And Depending on the license the organization has the employee account must have one the licenses below.
  
 Exchange online Plan 2 license
 Microsoft 365 E3 or Office 365 E3 license or higher
 Microsoft 365 Business Premium (Exchange only) license
 Office 365 E1 license with an Exchange Online Plan 2 or Exchange Online Archiving add-on license
 Microsoft 365 Frontline F5 Compliance or F5 Security &amp; Compliance add-on license
  
And one of these license as well assigned to them. Office 365 E1 license with a SharePoint Online Plan 2 or OneDrive for Business Plan 2 add-on license 
 are these correct?
 and also after exporting a mailbox, can i unassign the license and re-assign to another user? instead of buying 10-20 licenses?

                              <span>Hi,
 Our company has offices all over the world and some of them, namely in Asia have a lot of latency in accessing our fileserver which is on the other side of the globe.
 We contacted Aryaka to get a quote for a PoP solution but the price is absurdly high.
 Do you recommend any other type of company/solution?
 Thank you

 The Kafka website states that it is an event streaming platform, but I see many references to Queue or Topic with regard to Kafka and hence confused.

                              <span>Hi, have a bit of a weird issue and can’t find anything online regarding it. 
 I have a user that was put into a group when a site was fully cloud. Then they moved to hybrid and synced the groups with on prem AD. Now as this was a cloud user, we cannot remove them from the group. 
 Other users can be added and removed fine from the on-prem AD but this user is just stuck in the group which they need to be removed from. 
 I’ve tried syncing an on prem account with their cloud account and adding then removing, but they still are stuck in this group. 
 Anyone got any suggestions?

 I&#x27;m trying to understand what will happen in October 2023 when the Kerberos changes mentioned in KB5020805 enter the enforcement state without the ability to disable or override the enforcement.
 Will Server 2008 R2 member no longer be able to get tickets after enforcement? Or will this only affect domain controllers?
 I&#x27;m quite aware that the correct solution is to get rid of 2008 so I&#x27;m kinda hoping this will be argument I need to get it done.

Unlike traditional two-way radios, PoC radios offer a more stable connection with which users do not need to worry about being intercepted or experiencing frequent call drops.
 There are some reasons why PoC radios prevail over traditional two-way radios.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 So I&#x27;ve got a client who has started receiving the following message pretty frequently over the last month or so: 
 &quot;Trying to connect to: \\domain.tld\SharedData\fileshare&quot;
 It seems to occur mainly in Office apps ie Word, Excel, Project but then again these are the primary apps they use. I can generally replicate it by going File -&gt; Open, open any file, then go File -&gt; Save As and immediately I get the dialog box with the above message. Once it resolves (after up to a minute) and the document saves it doesn&#x27;t occur again for a period of time. To me that smacks of DNS but I can resolve the share via Windows Explorer or by doing an nslookup at any time before or after opening and saving and it resolves with no issues.
 Environment is Windows Server 2019 on premises Active Directory running two DCs in Hyper-V VMs on two different physical hosts. I&#x27;m running DFS Namespace with both DCs listed under Namespace servers. Less than 50 clients. Clients are all Windows 10 with two Windows 11 machines connected via either wireless or gigabit ethernet. Addresses are assigned via DHCP and both DCs are the only DNS servers assigned. Office applications range from 2016 to 365.
 It must be DNS (even when it isn&#x27;t lol) but I confess I&#x27;m not sure where to go from where or how else to troubleshoot. If you can access a share immediately via Windows Explorer, or have nslookup return an immediate correct result, what else is left? And yet the problem still occurs to the point that people are getting visibly frustrated.

                              <span>Hello all,
 In our Azure tenant we have recently imported 300 or so guest users and are now in the process of troubleshooting the 10 or so that have sign-in problems. Most of these problems are pretty clear and solvable, but there&#x27;s one that I can&#x27;t figure out.
 We invited this user with a [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address, and she tries to sign in with that address. When she does however, the AADSTS50020 error occurs, with a completely different [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) address:
 https://imgur.com/x2W1T6y 
 Now, AFAIK that error means that e-mail address isn&#x27;t known in our tenant, which is correct, since [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) isn&#x27;t invited in our tenant, [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) is.
 When I check the [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) user in our Azure AD, i can&#x27;t find the hotmail address anywhere:
 https://imgur.com/lLMJpPh 
 https://imgur.com/W1U5Vyj 
 My suspicion is that somehow the [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address is linked to that person&#x27;s MS account. 
 My question is, how do I solve this? I could invite [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) into our Azure AD, but the [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) is an old address of this person which she no longer wishes to use. So I need to solve this and have this person log in with their [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address.
 Any ideas? Thanks everyone!

                              <span>Hi all, I am studying Windows networking pretty hard at the moment and trying to understand the need for Microsoft&#x27;s Browser service.
 I understand that it doesn&#x27;t require dns, so what makes sense to me is that it is primarily needed for use in non-active directory network environments. Is that right?
 And/or is there some other reason for it being functional in active directory? I.e. does it actually provide something that active directory doesn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t?
 While I am here asking questions I will also ask, what in your estimation is the prevalence of non-Active Directory Windows networks these days? (I can see small offices/doctors/dentist surgery sized places not needing active directory)
 Thanks in advance!
 Fwiw I have googled and read several links but haven&#x27;t found anything that really helps me understand why it exists at all now.

 Does anyone know much about the security of them or if they can be managed centrally? Seems to me like they lack on this front and being able to sync to a corporate environment.

                              <span>Good morning or afternoon, fellow guys and girls.
 I have a new issue on some of my notebooks I have never seen before. We deployed a new Update to our Check Point VPN Client on ~ 100 devices. On a minority of the devices, the updated caused to kill the device&#x27;s connectivity completely. The WiFi Adapter still shows networks it can (and also can connect to them) but then reports &quot;No Internet access&quot;.
 An &quot;ipconfig&quot; reveals what&#x27;s going on: it shows nothing at all. It seems like Windows lost track of it&#x27;s adapters.
 Unfortunately, uninstalling networking devices does not do anything. Manually installing the Ethernet and/or the WiFi driver doesn&#x27;t resolve it either. The only solution we had until now was to completely reinstall Windows.
 Additionally, the Event Log does not show anything relevant to find the actual cause neither.
 ​
 Has anyone else had this issue and might know a solution that does not include calling the user to the office for a reinstallation?

 I just want to know what are support projects/Production support mean ?
 Like do you mean windows admin,azure admin, Linux admin, active directory admin, backup admin , Database admin..etc are known as produc
 If you say these are production support roles, what makes you think there&#x27;s no learning curve ?? For example) Active Directory and Group Policy itself an ocean !!! 
 If the above roles are not production support, then what roles are and what are their daily roles and responsibilities?

                              <span>Does anyone have any recommendation for a PCIE raid card. I have a client that is considering to use a workstation as a offsite backup/monitoring/metrics server. Since the server is in a remote location space is limited. We plan on utilizing it to run ESXI with one datastore to run a freenas server (to handle replications) and a few other VMs for monitoring and testing.
 Yes we thought about using freenas&#x27;s vm and jails but we opted to run it in an esxi environment.
 And before anyone starts saying anything we already have onsite and a remote backup solution. This is just a hey if we lose a lot of data lets see if we can restore here before we send in an order to recall data. 
 Obviously if you have any links (and yes ebay included) that would be great. Ideally we are looking for new pcie raid cards that can connect sata disks. Refurb units will be fine but we are looking for at least some sort of warranty to replace the card within a year if something were to happen.
 ​
 I was also thinking of getting this from newegg
 https://www.newegg.com/p/14G-0006-001G5?quicklink&#x3D;true
 And passing the card in to the freenas VM itself.

                              <span>I have two industrial machines that communicate via broadcast and multicast traffic. 
 I&#x27;m trying to block a set of ports and multicast addresses while keeping the other broadcast and multicast features working. 
 So far the devices I have laying around will only apply the firewall on routed traffic, not touching the devices on the same network.
 Looking for a recommendation on a device. Hoping to avoid a micro PC with two network ports: our setup is portable, people tend to yank power before worrying about shutdown sequences.
 Details:
 Broadcast is used for detection then multicast for actual communication, so both machines need to be on the same LAN to play nicely.
 They also use two realtime communication protocols at the same time, one protocol is nice and efficient, and the other one tries to hog the entire link to itself. The nice protocol uses IGMPv2 and the 236.0.0.0 range, the other protocol is a blackbox but uses 239.0.0.0 and opens ports 30000 thru 30007. I think if I could drop 239.0.0.0 and the associated ports I could solve my issues.
 I&#x27;m trying to add Point 2 Point wireless for long range comms using the lightweight protocol, but the heavyweight protocol seems to saturate the wireless bridge and the lightweight protocol can&#x27;t connect. Everything works OK enough with Wifi 6 links, but I&#x27;m trying for hundreds of feet in a noisy environment, with TP Link P2P or Ubiquiti P2P limited to their 100Mbps ports. Upgrading to the 5ghz P2P stuff seems like kicking the can down the road, since at 15 feet away the heavyweight protocol is laggy over 802.11ax.
 Googling around brings me to articles about &quot;Packet Filtering Firewalls&quot;, but without naming any devices.

                              <span>A bit of background:
 I&#x27;m responsible for deploying Android-based devices in MDU/manufacturing/healthcare environments. Anywhere from 50 to over 1500 at a time. The process involves updating the device firmware and enrolling into an EMM/MDM of some sort. Because of the nature of the industry, a lot of the time we&#x27;re forced to use guest Wi-Fi networks or a mobile hotspot to do so, which means we&#x27;re limited to running 4-8 at a time, and even then, still run into issues that require a reset and re-enroll of the device.
 That said: here are the back-end requirements needed to complete these steps:
  
For the firmware updates, an HTTP/S server (apache, IIS, nginx, etc.) w/ relatively quick on-board storage (SATA SSD or PCIe NVMe).
 For Google services and EMM enrollment, a decent (unrestricted) pipe to the internet.
  
I&#x27;m thinking I can kill two birds with a single device, but I&#x27;ve yet to find something that supports the following:
  
Wifi 6 router supporting HTTP/S server functionality and
 Cellular WAN functionality (5G or LTE cat. 16 or better) OR
 the ability to authenticate via RADIUS to hotel landing pages that require a last name and room number, for example.
  
My initial thoughts are to go with an x86 appliance such as the FW6D from Protectli, though I wanted to get your thoughts before I made a decision. 
 Thanks in advance!!

 For example, if neighbor 10.10.10.10 send me the community string 5555:1, I want to prepend all routes to that neighbor with my AS.
 The use case is so that individual neighbors can influence the path they take to get to some shared network resources.

                              <span>Last couple jobs were at a large regional ISP. I mostly did the capacity maintenances for the edge aggregation routers to the core, via ROADM. I’d add and drop fiber links from the ring, add the configurations for the new interfaces in IOS-XR, write the MOP, sometimes order equipment and deploy it to a hub, and either ran the maintenance or scheduled it to a overnight guy to do for me. 
 I also did new turn-ups of E-BGP peers on the CRS-16, and helped manage the core route reflectors. We were first escalation for outages as well. 
 I left work for FMLA reasons and my confidence is low. Most jobs are enterprise and not sure what to expect really. It’s hard for me to remember some topics I knew inside and out. Managed primary the underlay transport but did some MPLS L2VPN, L3VPN, and VRF stuff for enterprise BGP peering.
 Anyone have any tricks or tips to quickly catch myself back up? I find re-reading material I’ve already read to be difficult. It’s like the information is in the back of my head and the moment I read it again it becomes boring.
 Also having trouble finding interviews. I used to get several lined up and competing offers. Barely even getting responses from company recruiters. Often passed up and never even spoken too.

 An interface in NetBox (our DCIM) is updated &gt; A webhook is sent to a server &gt; A script is executed with a number of details about the interface (access/voice/trunked, etc) which launches an Ansible playbook enacting the changes made in NetBox.
 It&#x27;s working decently, but I&#x27;ve ran into an issue. One of the plays is meant to configure an access and voice VLAN on an interface, but it appears to be executing the commands out of order. Specifically, I think it is trying to disable trunk encapsulation before setting the interface&#x27;s mode to access (this particular interface was set to trunk prior to trying to run this test). I&#x27;m…</span>

                              <span>I almost posted this in r/homenetworking because the needs are so basic. 
 My friend has asked me to recommend a router for his small business office. They only need it for delivering internet to their staff laptops. They don&#x27;t have an internal network/domain or anything. All of their HR and Scheduling they just use websites for and all storage is google cloud storage. 
 They have equipment from Cox but the router constantly drops connections and has a weak signal at the far end the building. And it seems to be limited to 10 connections simultaneously when there are generally about 15 to 18 people in the office at peak. 
 They&#x27;re just looking for something that&#x27;s fairly simple to setup/manage, can deliver solid speeds, and allow upwards of 20+ users simultaneously. 
 It almost seems like any basic router will do the job, but I think signal strength was my concern as the office isn&#x27;t HUGE, but their internet comes in in one corner of the building so the router will go there, and have to pass through many many walls to reach the offices at the opposite end. 
 Thanks for any recommendations

                              <span>Hello,
 We are Cisco only shop and about to purchase a few new c1000, but due to long shipping dates, we also got an offer for cbs 220. 
 I understand that the CLI is limited but my question is how much it is limited compared to IOS? 
 And other than that, what are the main differences between the 2 switches? Note that we are probably not going to use stacking and additional power supplies. Is the cbs220 weaker hardware and performance wise compared to the c1000?
 Thanks.

                              <span>My company is purchasing a new office and I am pushing hard for large upgrades to our network infrastructure. We have an office of about 100 people, but can grow to 200 when we have remote users in the office.
 ​
 Currently we have a very basic network. The only redundancy we have is our firewall which I believe I am going to upgrade to Palo, but maybe Fortinet. The current switches we have are simply access switches. SG500X switches that are not stacked. I have been pressing to upgrade the configuration and it may happen.
 Do you think some type of Collapsed Core implementation is overkill for this network?
 I have been looking at possibly going Aruba for core and access or do i keep the SG500X&#x27;s and just get a 9200
 I am trying not to freak them out with pricing but now is the time to future proof some of our equipment so i have a good argument.
 Thoughts? Recommendations? Thanks.
 Edit: Adding a few notes on how our network is used.
 Email - 365
 SharePoint for some doc storage
 Data warehouse located in Azure (Tunnel back to office)
 2 Hyper V hosts basic servers (AD/DNS/Storage/Dynamics GP/RRAS)
 Datto which will most likely be decommissioned and will use our Veeam server as backup target along with NAS that will stay at our old office for offsite.

 I have one, but it feels very sketchy &amp; unreliable in different regards.

 I am a new network admin ordering a circuit for the first time. The ISP tech gave me the LAN/WAN and the Peer LAN/WAN. I assume the Peer LAN/WAN info is what I configure on my edge device and the other info is on the CPE device. 
 He also mentioned we have an &quot;internal LAN block which doesnt get advertised but you could utilize them and they get routed through your WAN IP&quot; Is there a name for something like this I could do more research on? I am at a loss for what that means.

                              <span>I have a script doing some checks on cisco IOS_XE switches with netmiko. Here is one example of what it is doing.....
 from operator import ne from netmiko import ConnectHandler from textfsm import TextFSM from pprint import pprint import colorama from colorama import Fore, Style from getpass import getpass User &#x3D; input(&quot;What is your username?&quot;) Pass &#x3D; getpass() with open (&#x27;Devices.txt&#x27;) as Devices: for IP in Devices: Device &#x3D; { &#x27;device_type&#x27;: &#x27;cisco_ios&#x27;, &#x27;ip&#x27; : IP, &#x27;username&#x27;: User, &#x27;password&#x27;: Pass } net_connect &#x3D; ConnectHandler(**Device) print ( Fore.YELLOW + &#x27;Checking Compliance on Switch &#x27; + IP) print ( Fore.YELLOW + &#x27;-&#x27;*80) List &#x3D; [&quot;boot network&quot;, &quot;ip boot server&quot;, &quot;ip bootp server&quot;, &#x27;ip dns server&#x27;, &#x27;ip identd&#x27;, &#x27;ip finger&#x27;, &#x27;ip http server&#x27;, &#x27;ip rcmd rcp-enable&#x27;, &#x27;ip rcmd rsh-enable&#x27;, &#x27;service config&#x27;, &#x27;service finger&#x27;, &#x27;service tcp-small-servers&#x27;, &#x27;service udp-small- servers&#x27;, &#x27;service pad&#x27;] output1 &#x3D; net_connect.send_command(&#x27;show run&#x27;) if all(List in output1 for List in List): print ( Fore.RED + &quot;Not compliant&quot;) else: print ( Fore.GREEN + &quot;Compliant&quot;) print(Style.RESET_ALL) 
 I am basically just doing different checks and the at the end I get a bunch of lines saying complaint or Not compliant.
 Is there a way I can summarize all these print statements? Like at the end say &quot;10 compliants and 2 not complaints&quot;. That way I don&#x27;t have to read down through everything, I can just get one line saying how many of each?
 Also want to point out that this will be run on multiple switches. So it would be nice to maybe at the end print &quot;switch 192.168.1.1 has 2 complaints and 10 not complaints&quot;. Or something like that. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Since upgrading our old ASA 5506X&#x27;s to 9.16 we have intermittent issues with them where they&#x27;ll drop the IPSec tunnel. I can SSH to the outside interface (access is restricted to our Corporate IP block) and reboot them and they come back up and will function normally for days.
 We haven&#x27;t encountered this issue on the 5508X&#x27;s that we have, only the 5506X&#x27;s. 
 This began occurring when we updated to 9.16.3.15 but we&#x27;re now on 9.16.4 and the problem is still occurring.
 We are in the process of migrating to FPR-1010&#x27;s but this issue is a PITA. 
 Looking at the syslogs it appears to happen each time the IPSEC tunnel is recreated.

 I am looking for a physical firewall that will allow me to block websites (ie: YouTube, Twitter) in my office network. And I want to limit the access to this firewall so that I can access to it only by plugin a laptop to it (meaning: no remote access to the firewall configuration).
 What device I am looking for?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hello! 
 I have a strange behavior.
 Our two SX550X-24FT 24-Port 10G switches (no stack) running on the same FW &quot;Version: 2.5.7.85&quot; and in the same rack, jumped after round about 12 months to a 100% CPU usage and a strange RAM usage.
 ​
 Both have the same output with sh tech-support: 
 ------------------ show cpu utilization ------------------
 CPU utilization service is on.
 CPU utilization
 ---------------
 five seconds: 100%; one minute: 100%; five minutes: 100%
 ------------------ components versions ------------------

 ​
 Last boot of the Switch:

 Start of the 100% CPU load:

 Switch02: 2022-11-13 11:46 AM
 ​
 Also noteworthy is, that the switch itself is responsive and runs completely fine!
 ​
 Has anyone experienced something like that ?

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m curious if Office 365 like Exchange Online or SharePoint Online or Teams be protected behind an SDP/ZTNA so that any user trying to login would need to be on the SDP network (instead of VPN). I know office 365 is pretty convenient as it can be accessed from anywhere.

 About how big of an IT department would you expect?
 Currently doing it all myself but curious if folks think that might not be sustainable?

                              <span>Hey everyone of r/sysadmin, I’m a young up and comer in the IT world and not even a sysadmin, been doing this for 2 years now. My journey started off at a local technical school where I was taught the basics of IT and networking, from there I got my A+, Net+ and CCNA. 
 Fast forward to today, and I find myself in a nice helpdesk position with a lot of downtime that in 5 months I have been able to completely study and pass my ms-203, my Sec+ as well as the ms-100 and now looking at the ms-101 as well as the company is paying for a course for my az-104. 
 Well, as I have been doing these I have been looking around at jobs because well, helpdesk isn’t my goal, I love working with the MS cloud suite and would love to get into a position where working with that stuff is my main responsibility, but everywhere I look, I may have some of the requirements, a lot of place are asking for many more years of experience, but the one thing I’m seeing most is that darned piece of paper I don’t have. A degree. 
 So that brings me to my question for you guys, if you have a degree, when did you get yours? I’m only 23 myself and kind of figure there’s no reason I shouldn’t just do it, and I was looking and a lot of the courses for an Associates in Cloud Architecting are for certs I already have, so I would think it would be a cakewalk.

How about 20,000 (who knows what the future holds)?

                              <span>I have a USB M.2 drive enclosure and it is amazingly fast.
 I would like to have it so that It has multiple partitions to boot from.
 I&#x27;d like one to be a full blown installed Windows 11 OS.
 and I like to also be able to boot into the windows 11 and 10 installers. 
 I thought at first the best way to do this would be multiple partitions but only one partition can be seen from the boot menu.
 Any suggestions on how i might accomplish this?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m having a conversation with management that many of us have probably had over the years, about establishing a formalised product lifecycle within the business (retiring devices after X period, replacing with new).
 Now I&#x27;ve done a lot of $$ number crunching etc on the relative costs and risks, but what they&#x27;re asking for is actual case studies about why product lifecycles are important, and the increased risk of device failures based on age of the device.
 I can find the government (AU) tax department info about expected product lifecycles, but I&#x27;m having trouble finding any actual case study analysis of why those are the expected product lifecycles. 
 Anyone know of any such studies they can share?

                              <span>Sorry if I come off as rude but I just feel like expressing my opinion regarding the stereotype in IT that we&#x27;re all supposed to be grumpy and unhelpful. At least that&#x27;s the perception, I&#x27;ve met so many people that will straight up ignore you if they haven&#x27;t created a ticket or booked in a meeting to solve an issue. 
 I feel like an alien for just being a happy-go-lucky chap willing to help out anyone and everyone. It&#x27;s a good feeling to be someone who&#x27;s reliable and a go to source for info or assistance. 
 I also see a lot of posts on /r/itcareerquestions regarding &quot;What are IT jobs where I never ever have to talk to anyone?&quot;. The answer is none. You will need to talk to people and being able to talk to people will make your life and others so much easier. 
 Just wondering if anyone else feels the same way as I do.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m starting to think that I haven&#x27;t become the &#x27;grumpy introvert&#x27; is because I have been in the industry long enough for it to crush my soul yet...

                              <span>UPDATE: We did find the file in the SharePoint Recycle Bin. It is showing as Deleted by SharePoint App. Why would the app delete files? How can I find the setting that is doing it and stop it?
 Also, just as important, how can I determine if other files are being affected?
 Original post:
 Hopefully, this is only happening on one file, but I&#x27;m not sure I would know.
 Document stored in SharePoint mysteriously disappeared. It is not in the recycle bin, but I did find an old version in our SaaS backup and restored that.
 Minutes after restoring the file to its original location, it disappeared again. We cannot figure out why.
 Additional information: I tried restoring the file to its original location, but it did not restore. I restored to a separate SharePoint site where it happily sits waiting as instructed. Then, I download a copy to its original location and it&#x27;s gone in minutes.
 Any idea what might be causing this?

                              <span>This is probably a stupid question but I’ve just worked my way up from a helpdesk role into a sysadmin role and need advice on ADMX records.
 I’m testing Windows 11 on a couple of devices now, to prepare for a gradual rollout of the new OS to 300+ domain-joined devices over the next year. I’m testing registry changes locally but will need them to be pushed out via GPO eventually.
 I want to update the central store from the ‘Windows 10 21H2 v2’ Template to the ‘Windows 11 21H2’Template but am worried there would be issues like some Windows 10 reg entries being removed as they’re not needed in Windows 11.
 Have any of you run into issues after upgrading the templates when it’s a mixed environment?
 TIA for your help, never done this before and the old sysadmin is gone so I have no one here to guide/train me apart from good old Google! I don’t want to make too many mistakes and have the higher-ups on my case just a month into the new role!

 So since a few months my printer decided to be a jerk and print a shadow of the beginning. I know it&#x27;s a cheap printer and the warranty has run out but normally HP got some good printers that work better than their consumer PCs and laptops.
 Anyway have a look and please let me know what you guys think. https://imgur.com/a/7S2nPe5

                              <span>Hey folks,
 Went down a random Wikipedia rabbit hole last night and came across the ECHO, DISCARD and DAYTIME protocols. Curiosity got the best of me and I enabled them on an old Raspberry Pi just to test them out. I think the DAYTIME protocol is handy, almost like a (slimmed down) NTP alternative, and the DISCARD protocol could be useful as a network-based /dev/null.
 What other protocols exist out there in the same vein? What use, if any, do they have in modern networks? What are some maybe fun or obscure protocols that can still be run on modern IP networks? I&#x27;d love more ideas to investigate here. Thanks!

                              <span>Is there a way (relatively easy and reliable, not super hacky) to unlock a Linux server full disk encrypted with LUKS?
 Either through a second machine reading console (eg, router), or a minimal SSH (in a separate small OS) loaded in boot time to enter the password?
 Servers need to be rebooted, and I don’t have physical access all the time.

 I&#x27;ve realized the company I work for uses the Chocolatey package manager to quickly deploy third-party and internal developed application on out customer computers. I have not much experience with the whole legal stuff, but according to the legal page on the chocolatey.org site, the use of the free part of the software is only granted for non-profit generating organizations.
 So now can we use the free part of chocolatey as a package manager or not?

                              <span>Hi, I have an issue that I can’t seem to resolve for a client.
 Essentially, we are receiving spam mails from accounts with a .top domain suffix The problem is, it’s constantly changing.
 For example, we might receive a mail from xxx.top and then the next day, it’s xyz.top
 How can I blacklist this?

 So I joined this company a while ago, and noticed we have Teamviewer installed on a bunch of customer servers for &quot;easy remote access&quot; 
 I know this is from pure lazyness as we have VPN access to all of the customers. 
 What do you guys think, is it considered &quot;safe&quot; enough to leave Teamviewer running when it&#x27;s locked down to our account only, and all users are only &quot;members&quot; in the teamviewer company. 
 I had the pros / cons with multiple colleagues about this, and both sides got good arguments. 
 What are your thoughts of this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Testing clearpass for network access control, just with wireless atm. 802.1x auth seems to work and users are prompted to enter their username and password. However the option to remember windows credentials is greyed out/can&#x27;t be ticked 
 Is this a setting somewhere or normal? I know about machine certs and machine auth but just testing user auth for this

Like, we do ssh to bastion via key file and then change the user with password to get main server key file access to do ssh from specific directory. So, for this scenario how should I approach it?

                              <span>I have worked as a sysadmin and devops for the last 15 years, last 7 years were in one company at the DevOps engineer and Site Reliability Engineer roles, but I had to quit for health-related issues. In my work I touched each part of the stack from hardware to Linux and Windows administration, to networking, monitoring, alerting, databases, webservers, data analysis and report building using SQL, troubleshooting issues involving many moving parts, log management, writing custom instruments in python, AWS, CI/CD, docker, incident resolution involving many people, so in general I’m quite familiar with modern Sysadmin and DevOps practices.
 It might look like a tremendous overkill for what I’m looking for, but right now my ability to work is quite limited, so I’m looking for small jobs involving server support and troubleshooting and some log and data analysis, which won’t take much of my time, but I can be oncall and available to fix issues on the need-to basis, and I can provide 24//7 coverage for critical infrastructure, first setting up some infrastructure for projects which concerns alerting and availability practices.
 I also did some mentoring for my friends concerning networking, linux, basic programming and server administration, because I like doing it. I even once wrote a Linux tutorial.
 I’m sure there should be demand for this and people would be interested in paying some monthly fee for someone skilled for looking after their stuff, but I don’t really know how to find it, because I’m used to working full-time in large companies. I tried but had no luck with Upwork for this, and I would like to learn places where I can find such gigs or talk to people and network.
 Thank you for your time.
 P.S. I didn’t write on reddit for a long time, but I was active here once, and for those interested, this is my old account: https://old.reddit.com/user/mwargh/submitted/ My Linux tutorial is here if you wanna look at my style: https://archive.ph/xDb8o

 Can you please suggest some ways to do so.
 PS : All the tutorials and posts I&#x27;ve found suggest ways to add a desktop environment of linux on windows, instead of &quot;remoting&quot; the system.

                              <span>Hi,
 i am currently using an on-prem RMM service for my clients. I currently allow NAT from known clients ips to my RMM ports. I do not expose those ports to any other IP.
 However, i want to use the RMM on client laptops when they are not onsite. I do not trust all these laptops, some are residential users and some are personal devices.
 Can i create a VPN (using OPNsense) to a &quot;dead in the water&quot; local network, using split-tunnel with the only route being to/from RMM ports, with no other traffic allowed? I basically just want to route RMM traffic so that it comes from a known IP.
 Is VPN secure used in this way? Is there any risk of clients reaching local network resources?

                              <span>Not sure how to propose this question correctly. We have one of our circuits coming in over coaxial. connection comes into the standard router provided by the provider and bridged to our our FW. we are looking to bring TV into our Break room. I&#x27;d like the TV Receiver in there. would a moca set up work? are their better options ? not looking to have more cabling ran. I&#x27;d like to use the existing ethernet we have ran. 
 Let me know if there are any further details needed to help design this run.

                              <span>Has anyone noticed a recent decline in the quality of TAC engineers / support? 
 I guess it depends on who you get / technology area but I’ve a couple of engineers recently who have been quite frankly useless!
 Most recently Nexus support. An hour on a webex of ‘investigations’ half of which was spent in compete silence with the odd chase here and there from myself. Eventually only to be told N9K doesn’t support disruptive upgrades which doesn’t even make any sense. 
 It just doesn’t seem to be the same as it once was…
 Edit: wow glad it’s not just me then! I’ll be writing a few emails I think!

                              <span>So, it seems like Cisco has amended the EoL announcements for the following products:
  
Catalyst 3650: 
 Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2024
 New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2026
 
 Catalyst 3850: 
 Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2023
 New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2025
 
 Catalyst 3850 fiber SKU&#x27;s: 
 Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 4/2025
 New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 4/2027
 
  
They basically seem to extend the vulnerability and security support by 2 years. As the Catalyst 3650 &amp; 3850&#x27;s will never get IOS XE v17.x support, IOS XE v16.12.x will be the last version to run on these. The EoL announcement for IOS XE v16.12.x also states:
  
Please Note: Catalyst 3650 and Catalyst 3850 platforms are not part of this EOL announcement. Refer to 3650/3850 Hardware EOL announcement for software support timelines.
  
Are we correct to state that with this Cisco is committing themselves to keep IOS XE v16.12.x alive for these platforms and fix future security issues might they be discovered? Because it seems like a lot of overhead to keep supporting such an old codebase. However these dates are important for us during budget meetings to help decide which devices to replace so we&#x27;d like to be correct in the interpretation.

                              <span>In the context of leveraging either/or for automating network services, and in terms of developing playbooks vs. writing scripts:
 Does anyone else feel like in the time it takes to learn Ansible, you might as well just learn Python? Python is so powerful and arguably easier to implement more complex tasks once you get the hang of it. In the time it takes you to learn all of the modules in Ansible, I feel like you could just learn Python.
 I also feel like the error handling and debugging capabilities of Ansible are horrible. I know Ansible is not a programming language, however, I’ve noticed a lot of organizations that attempt to treat it as if it is. 
 This post isn’t to crap on Ansible, I am genuinely curious why some of you prefer it. 
 I am well aware that Ansible is written in Python, no need to iterate that point when most of us here are aware of that.

                              <span>Hi all, So I am trying to understand the need for Microsoft&#x27;s Browser service. 
 What makes sense to me is that it is primarily needed for use in non-active directory environments. Is that right? Why is it still available in active directory environments (i.e. is there some other networking reason for it being there, or does it actually provide something that active directory doesn&#x27;t/can&#x27;t)? 
 Thanks in advance!
 Fwiw I have googled and read several links but haven&#x27;t found anything that really helps me understand why it exists at all now.

                              <span>I have a client that has begun to sublease their office space to other businesses. They are wanting these other companies to be able to book meeting rooms and other shared equipment. My client currently utilises 365 so all resources are available there via Outlook. I’ve been trying to search for a cloud or in-house hoisted solution but I haven’t had much luck. Ideally it would be good to give people access to an online portal where they can see all the office resources, see availability and put in booking requests.

                              <span>Hi alll,
 Preface: Using the OpenVPN server built into PFsense and using the OpenVPN Connect Client as it works across multiple platforms.
 I’ve been trialing OpenVPN with a MS NPS and the Azure MFA plugin installed. All is working well, I can press connect, get an MFA push etc
 However, i have been testing idle timeouts and have a potential issue. When the client times out, the session disconnects but will reconnect immediately and try over and over again, spamming Azure MFA. 
 On two occasions now, Push Notifications have just stopped working. I can’t get it to work again. I’ve removed the Authenticator device from the security portal, but when I go to add it back it fails (have tried via sign-in in the app as well which works), but still no push notifications. I have also checked blocked users in the multifactor authentication blade, but the account is not listed there.
 The only way I’ve found to get push notifications to work again, is to delete and recreate the 365 user, which is of course not ideal. 
 Has anyone experienced the issue with Push notifications being blocked? I raised a case with support but they have been absolutely useless.
 EDIT: The error code I get is Error Code: 500121

                              <span>Hi. Let say i have one hundred pc that i support. What is a good remote software i can utilize to connect? I would need to be able to connect even if user is not at the computer, so it would have to have capability to access without a prompt from user. I’ve used Teamviewer in past and it worked but maybe something better?
 Thank and sorry if language not perfect.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had about 4 Intel 545s drives (e.g. SSDSC2KW512G8X1) &quot;fail&quot; at three different clients (workstations) in the last year. They were installed in 2017-2018 when the drives were new and available.
 They don&#x27;t out-right fail but start to exhibit performance issues or have errors that prevent full system backups from completing (e.g. Macrium image backup).
 We are able to successfully clone them using ddrescue with a few KB of bad sectors detected.
 Firmware updates, trimming, and chkdsk /r do not resolve the issue with the drives and these drives have had the latest firmware on them.

                              <span>So far I’ve had the pleasure to get to know a lot of you here and this made me want to ask a very important question. 
 I recently climbed up to “Senior Systems Administrator”, and apart from the slight impostor syndrome, I’ve come to wonder, where do you go from here? 
 Yeah I did support roles, I put together servers, configure ESXi and RAID, design and implement Networks and Domains, perform migrations, etc etc. But what’s next? What are some higher positions that I can aim to get into? Why are some things that I SHOULD learn in my free time to improve? 
 I feel like I’ve hit a road block, I do all those things and I code and develop websites on the side, but I’m not sure where the road takes me from here. Especially that I’m currently not very happy at my current position and was advised by a lot of you here to find another position, especially one that gives me better vacation days per year. 
 My ultimate goal is to be happy, and to be fully remote/WFH. I’d like to hear it from the wise ones what they think I should do to improve and reach my goals. What did you do to reach your goals? 
 On a side note, should I get a university degree? I dropped out 8 years ago and became a commercial aircraft pilot, but due to the pandemic and the Grindy nature of the industry, I reverted back into tech. The only credentials I have for my field is my experience, tech savviness and my Network+ cert. 
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am working on automating onboarding and offboarding of on-prem AD users. This would entail creating mailboxes, assigning permissions etc.. . I am semi-confident I can write a script that can do all of this. My worry is troubleshooting a long script down the line. I am trying to ideally break it down so it can be well understood in the future by me and future IT staff.
 From anyone&#x27;s experience, what is the best way to break this down. My concern with multiple scripts is passing data between them in a non-janky way.
 Any thoughts on an approach that is not 1 script. Whether that be using a tool like power automate, Jenkins or something similar.
 I do already have a script that pulls our user status from our hr.

                              <span>Hi, 
 For past few days we have been having a weird network drives issue. User can open an excel file and work on it and save it. If another user opens that same file, work in it and then try to save, it says that another user has it opened. It also creates a .tmp file in the same folder as well. 
 I checked the permissions, recreated the shared drive, Move the files over to another partition and recreated network drive. Same issue...
 Anyone seen this before?

                              <span>Evening All, 
 I&#x27;ll be up front and honest that I&#x27;m not that great at all with Azure AD, I do more front-line and hardware support, but I&#x27;ve been given a project to get MFA implemented for a client company due to Microsoft switching off basic authentication globally. 
 The plan was originally to enable MFA for all of the users, with small batches being done on a daily basis but I&#x27;ve found out this evening that 80+ manufacturing users that work on the factory floor can&#x27;t use mobile phones for health &amp; safety rules, so that throws out using MS Authenticator App.
 I know from the initial reading of the various guides online, that there is the possibility of using conditional access but I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to get this setup, as all of the systems onsite use a single DHCP scope so setting it up for a specific IP address range wouldn&#x27;t be a viable option.
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and if I find a solution myself I&#x27;ll update my post. :-)

Usually they mention it hasn&#x27;t been looked at in awhile. Thursday evening I went to one person&#x27;s house, a 25 min drive turned into 45 minutes as my gps took me almost 10 miles away from the house for some reason (she said it does that to almost everyone)
 So anyway, I get there and I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll be in and out in an hour. Well, right away the laptop is super slow and I notice that it is a Toshiba who have been out of the laptop game for a bit. She says laptop is around 10 years old.
 SO I start uninstalling junk, yeah she has a couple adware programs but nothing crazy. but man, just clicking on &quot;uninstall&quot; and waiting for the prompts to come up was taking almost 20 mi…</span>

 So the business I am working for is deciding to actually put money into their IT department. By all means, go get your socks that have now been blown off. 
 One of the first things we did was provide E3 licenses to all our users. Another SysAdmin took charge of making all our machines hybrid joined to azure so that&#x27;s neat. Months later though, an overwhelming majority of our devices are still Windows Pro. 
 The fix we found is going through Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Shared Experiences, seeing that there are problems with the user&#x27;s account, and clicking &quot;fix now&quot; which prompts them for MFA and then huzzah, sorted. 
 So far this has been an incredibly manual process and I was wondering if we could have a thread sharing experiences with getting computers to Enterprise?

 Do I need RDS CAL or User/Device CAL licencing to add user to that domain? From what I&#x27;ve read, it should be User/Device CAL, but I just wanted to be sure, I&#x27;m on the right track. 
 Aditionally, I&#x27;ve googled with no success, the process to install said licences, any pointer regarding that, will be greatly appreciated.

 Excuse the text wall. Posting from a throwaway account. TIA for all replies!
 I’m hoping for some advice regarding a job I am in the process of interviewing for. I’m currently a field service technician with only about 9 months of experience servicing copiers/printers. The job I have made it to the second round for is a System Administrator role at a business with a 4 person IT team. I only have the Google cert and some virtual home lab experience. Did help desk in college about 8 years ago (unrelated bachelor’s degree). I haven’t lied or even really embellished my experience/qualifications. 
 The pay seems on the low end for the role, only about a dollar more than I’m a making now. The hours are also weird. However, it seems like a great place to gain experience and learn. Any advice on if offered whether or not to take it? I can provide more context if needed. I guess I’ll burn that bridge when I get to it.

                              <span>Hello,
 Looking at a high performance (cpu/mem) server for our memory intensive database. Previously ran this on rock solid IBM POWER pSystem platforms but the vendor decided to drop support for big blue.
 On the Intel X86_X64 side, looking for something solid from a reputable vendor, I have hands-on experience with commodity Dell PE R7xx servers that we use in a VMware cluster, and while they perform well for running commodity VMs - I am on the fence and looking at what other options are out there.
 Dell has the R940 in a 4-socket configuration, and HPE has ProLiant DL560 that is configurable in a 4-socket build.
 In researching, it appears Cisco has a UCS line of hardware, anyone have hands-on experience with these? How is their reliability and support compared to HPE/Dell?

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;m currently doing 2nd line support and my manager has suggested I gain exposure of the company IT Infrastructure. To get involved with jobs that the Infrastructure Engineer would normally be doing. 
 So the infrastructure is on-premise and it is stuff like Dell EMC, Cisco Switches and Firewalls, VMware V-Sphere and a few other things which I can&#x27;t remember from the top of my head. 
 Just recently I was able to get involved with a Switches and Firewalls upgrade project. It was myself, the Infra guy and NOC guy. I was assisting (with guidance) in installing the new hardware, running new cabling and testing the services that were working once the upgrade was complete. The actual upgrade bit was carried out mainly by the NOC guy and the Infra guy making sure that Servers/VMs were powered down/up and it&#x27;s all good after the upgrade.
 That being said, I am seeking advice on this community on what courses I can study myself to get a better understanding of the role and aid me when hands on.
 Thank you and sorry in advance.

                              <span>We are looking at doing cert-based auth for Meraki wifi.
 What I can&#x27;t seem to find specific details on are the reqs for the client cert itself, beyond having to be issued by the CA of the cert that is loaded into the meraki config.
 Does the cert have to be tied to any unique properties of the workstation (i.e. its name etc)? If so I assume we&#x27;ll have to go through sorting out a gpo to trigger autoenrollment for each machine. Ideally (at least for the moment) we&#x27;d like to avoid that and simply use a certutil script to push a pfx of a cert from our CA to the selected workstations&#x27; personal computer store.
 Will this work or are there unique properties the cert has to have/match on the workstation?
 Thanks!

 Let’s say the office computer are used for mainly AutoCAD, pdf, emails, general internet research.
 The computer at home. Will handle zoom like app for team or client chat/conference/share screen. 
 For a 1 to 1, true to speed remote access experience. What is the needed down/up speeds? What is more important the office or home internet?

                              <span>Hi there, we have a Flow that collects data from a Sharepoint List and sends it to a OneDrive location as a CSV file. 
 At the moment I manually have to copy the file to a folder on the DC because a scheduled Powershell script checks that location for the CSV. Is there a more efficient way to get the file from OneDrive straight to the &#x27;C:\temp\&#x27; on the DC?
 I know that it&#x27;s strongly advised not to install the OneDrive app on a DC.

 If you have a global rule Exchange Transport rule in the exchange admin centre that rejects email for some reason (e.g contains executable content) it sends the response to whatever address is in the return path envelope. Forged or not.
 Lovely backscatter. 
 Example rule that triggers it:
 New-TransportRule -Name &#x27;Block Executable Content MS Standard&#x27; -Priority &#x27;0&#x27; -Enabled $true -AttachmentHasExecutableContent $True -RejectMessageReasonText &#x27;Rejected due to executable attachment&#x27; -StopRuleProcessing $true -SetAuditSeverity Low -SenderAddressLocation HeaderOrEnvelope

                              <span>I have a set of applications on physical hardware that was stood up about 8 years ago - it has now come to the crunch point where this must be replaced, and I am tasked with virtualising the majority of it.
 It was all put on physical hardware at the time, because there was hardware purchased for another project that got cancelled, and it was up for grabs. It is pretty much all massively overspecced.
 I am now trying to figure out the sizing for ESXi VMs that I will need to replace these.
 I have Xymon (fka Hobbit) monitoring in place with stats going back 576 days which measures CPU, Memory, disk usage (among other things)
 I was thinking of basing my VMs on the peak values measured for these figures over the last 576 days, but a bit nervous since a lot of the values are tiny compared to the physical values.
 Especially since we have guideline sizings for virtual servers of this type which are massively above my measured values.
 What would be best practice here?
 Do you think these guidelines being rather large are to cope with potential spikes in usage we may see?
 An example, with CPU being the biggest problem here:
 My measured peak physical values CPU load 4 Mem 32GB
 My existing physical server CPU cores 16 Mem 64GB
 Reccommended VM sizing CPU cores 16 Mem 64GB

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I have started learning Linux and completed the following parts:
  
- Basic commands of Linux
 - Directory/File permissions in Linux
 - Setup Apache server and connected the DB etc - did the whole lab on this
  
Now I want to know what&#x27;s next to learn? I&#x27;d also like to know what Linux sys admin do on their daily jobs and what would they suggest new learner to learn as must for sys admin.
 Cheers!

I&#x27;ve been in this game for ~15 years and now in management but looking for something completely different. Are there any ex-IT people still lurking here (or know of someone) who successfully moved out of IT? I&#x27;m interested in what type of roles they changed to. I need inspiration! Thanks

 I&#x27;ve recently started setting up mail forwarding rules for any spam I receive that I didn&#x27;t sign up for, I find an executive&#x27;s (for the sender company) email address and just forward every spam email I receive from that company back to that exec (or if I can&#x27;t find an exec, their support@ or info@ emails work just as well, creates a ticket usually, or at least according to Zendesk).
 I have just received my fourth &quot;Please stop forwarding me all this spam!&quot; message.
 Would heavily recommend.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked to build data center storage for cheap but needs to be highly performant.
 The trouble I am having is coming up with the right combination and sweet spot for size, performance and overall cost and I thought this group is the right place to start asking the questions. Any help is appreciated, or kindly redirect me to the right place to ask the question (sorry if this is the wrong sub)
 Let me lay down some of the project&#x27;s conditions:
  
We want our own hardware, colo is ok (no using BackBlaze etc)
 We need to buy/rent cabinet
 Factor in network costs with a 10GE ISP connection, no egress costs
 Include elictricity use
 Include OSS storage software
 Hybrid NVME/SSD and HDD
 Total size of storage should be at least 20TB, preferably 80-100TB minimum, max 500TB
 Total cost per TB needs to be less than $2 per month over 3 years.
 
 For example, a $10k server, plus $2k running costs per year on a 100TB server comes in at $36k for 3 years. 100/36 &#x3D; $2.7 per TB over 36 months
 The above has way more costs, I just wanted to give an example. The goal is $2 or under per TB. 
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>This is not so much a technical question, more of a situational issue. My manager has finally put his retirement papers into HR. 
 Since then he has been a complete thorn in my supervisor&#x27;s and mine side; update business critical software / created downtime without notifying our Tech director (update caused a critical API client to fail, ended up causing weekend work plus multiple tickets into the sofrware vendor), buildout systems / updates system in the incorrect order (leaving us to try to figure out why the systems are not working), hording of information has gotten worse (our director had to force him to start handing it over), he only renewed our TLS wildcard cert for 1 year (it takes 3 days, plus a week of bouncing emails between people to get the downtime lined up/approved with over departments, to update all of our systems)... It&#x27;s been like this since he put in his retirement papers, and is getting worse.
 We tried to reason with him on some of these thing, like giving the devs 24hrs notice when we update there OS &amp; software stacks on dev environments, got shot down on that one (the old &quot;it&#x27;s just dev not production, we can do it at anytime&quot;).
 It&#x27;s almost to the point where we have to monitor what he does, sysadmin task wise, on every system.
 At this point kinda at a loss on how to handle this gently; supervisor and I still have to work with him for another 8 weeks, our Tech Director is at a loss too and is almost willing to pull our COO &amp; CEO in to talk with him, worst part is he is the only IT manager that we have had (he has been here for 25 years).
 Where would you start with this mess?

                              <span>Hi, 
 A little bit of background. I&#x27;ve about 7 years of experience, worked with L2/L3 protocols, L2/L3VPN, MPLS, EVPN-VXLAN etc. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m an expert at all these networking areas, but I&#x27;ve decent understanding on these. I&#x27;ve also worked with Cisco and Juniper OS and quite familiar with variants within and products. 
 Last two years I&#x27;ve picked up python and really like coding and automating some stuff. I think I like it more than the networking part itself. What kind of jobs are there where my networking experience will be beneficial but I get to do some python coding? I don&#x27;t think I can go full software development as it seems daunting task to start from zero and my networking experience would be wasted. Any advice would be much appreciated.

We are joining one of our smaller buildings into a larger building next week, and as such are moving the network equipment from the smaller location to the larger one. There are two switches I need to move the day before they go live at the new location. The larger location is already online so I would be adding these two switches to the existing network.
 I am moving two Aruba switches (Model 2930) from the existing smaller location to place in the larger location. Unfortunately we do not have the ability to set them up ahead of time, they need to be pulled the afternoon staff are moving out of the office an expected to be online the next morning fu…</span>

                              <span>I would like to relay all incoming traffic to another matching, this is my current test scenario:
 ​
  (Internet) | | Alicloud (I would like to have the EIP here) EIP: 8.208.20.138 8.208.20.138 | ^ VM (DHCP) | +-------------------+ +----VM Hetzner---+ |IPv4: 192.168.60.89|  | IPv4: Public IP | |IPv6: 240b:4005::30| | IPv6: Public /64| +-------------------+ +-----------------+ 
 The Alicloud instance, via DHCP, acquires a private IP class B (192.168.60.89) that is mapped to the public elastic IP 8.208.20.138, but it has a valid routable IPv6 address the one I use to create a wireguard tunnel to the VM in Hetzner.
 If I remove the private IP from the Alicloud instance ip addr del 192.168.60.89 dev eth0 I can&#x27;t ping any more the public EIP (8.208.20.138) as expected, but still ipv6 is up and running thus the wireguard tunnel, from the one I one to route all the ipv4 traffic. In this Alicloud instance, I have proxy_arp and ip_forward 
 I am stuck figuring out how to route the traffic from the EIP to the VM in hetzner.
 Any ideas?
 The reason for doing this is to use servers with cheaper bandwidth or better connectivity to some regions, I am aware of the BCP38, but first, need to solve the routing problem, especially when not having the public IP bonded to the instance.

                              <span>Hello everyone I&#x27;m trying to understand forward proxy and I&#x27;m not sure if I got it right and also I still have questions (I want to work with burp suite but I prefer to know how things works :)
 can any one help me please
 So in a normal case we type reddit.com the browser (after DNS ) will:
  
-&gt; establish a tcp connection then tls handshake ,in the handshake the broweser will receive a certificate from the reddit with a trusted CA ,then he will send the request to the server with the server ip address and the his src ip address 
  
​
  
now in the case of proxy :I&#x27;m still in doubt which one is correct (a root certificate of the proxy is already installed )
  
1-&gt; the browser will establish a tcp connection with the proxy and also a tls handshake with the proxy but the certificate that he will get is the certificate of the proxy, 
 then the browser will verify the certificate(but here the browser will get a certification !&#x3D; that contain a domain not requested ?)
 and he can send a request https to the proxy -&gt; the proxy will look at the request and
 then he will establish the connection with the server
 ​
 2-&gt;the browser will establish a tcp connection with the proxy and also a tls handshake with the proxy but the certificate that he will get is the certificate of the website but with the proxy as ROOT CA (how can the proxy know the website ?)
 the browser will verify the certificate(he will think that is the real website?) and he can send the http request (which ip address AS destination ?) the proxy will get the request and establish a connection with the server 
 ​
 please feel free to ask for clarification or even give me a deep explanation of the topic also if you know any resource I&#x27;m more than happy to learn

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on some security automation and standardizing documentation of our zones (and subnet descriptions). Basically tackling this from two angles:
 Hierarchal Tags Zones:
  
Trusted 
 Client
 Datacenter 
 Server
 File Server
 
 DMZ 
 Shared
 Jump Host
 
 
 Untrusted 
 Vendor 
 VPN
 Jump Host
 
 IoT
 DMZ 
 External
 Internal
 
 
  
non Hierarchal Zone Tags:
  
firewall instance (ie, tag for all zones behind firewall)
 Geo (may make this a parallel hierarchal tag)
 Behind firewall (from default gateway perspective)
 Not behind firewall (this actually wouldn&#x27;t be tagged directly. Technically everything is behind a firewall from an edge perspective. It would be NOT &quot;Behind Firewall&quot; AND &quot;firewall instance&quot; per firewall&quot;)
  
I&#x27;m having a hard time coming up with a good name for the Tag &quot;Behind Firewall&quot;. basically we have some of the untrusted zone behind firewalls...the &quot;Untrusted&quot; is the dmz&#x27;s or whatever that are behind the firewall, segmented from the general corporate network (client, datacenter), but we also have some &quot;Trusted&quot; zones behind theses same firewalls. as we get further into segmenting, I imagine &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;Untrust&quot; will get more muddled from a network/routing perspective. I want a tag that does not reference the trust or anything security related. I just want to tag it from a network routing perspective (ie, this subnet is behind a firewall). I can use other tags to define the firewall, geo, function, etc etc.
 Any thoughts? I&#x27;m considering &quot;Segmented&quot;, &quot;Firewalled&quot;, &quot;Behind&quot; (not seriously)...but none of these are as elegant and descriptive as the function based tags.
 Also interested in other ideas of how to organize complex zones.

                              <span>Hi,
 If profiling is disabled on ISE, ISE will still log each new mac address on the network and record it in endpoints and put them in Unknown group (not sure if it is a group) so in that case does those endpoints which are dynamically recorded on the ISE and hasn&#x27;t been assigned to any group or profile are also included in the &quot;Internal endpoints&quot; database of ISE and if we select &quot;Internal endpoints&quot; in our authentication policy for MAB then those endpoints will be authenticated?

                              <span>So I know what QinQ is in theory, C-Tag, S-Tag. 4096 VLANs with a single outer tag, scalability etc etc. But I&#x27;ve bit seen it in production. I&#x27;m about to move into a wholesale only ISP where I&#x27;m guessing this is going to be quite a thing as they grow.
 This is where my heads currently at, and I&#x27;d like any corrections/input into why we would use this.
 Let&#x27;s say we have a wholesale customer with 6000 subscribers. Each on their own VLAN. 1-4096 get an S-Tag of 1. 4096-6000 get an S-Tag of 2. As this wholesale customer grows, we provision more S-Tags per block of 4096 customers?
 What happens as the company becomes massive, national scale. 4096*4096 is still a scalability limit, especially when one customer may get a second S-Tag and only need it for an additional 100 customers, wasting a chunk of space.
 Maybe I&#x27;m thinking about this all wrong, hopefully one of you can out this straight for me :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently interviewing with a HFT firm in London for a junior network engineer position.
 A bit about me:
  
Network engineering summer internship at a company in an unrelated sector.
 Bsc from a Russel Group University.
 Some experience, through my own projects, in BGP (Traffic engineering, route filtering) Multicast (PIM-SM), OSPF (multi area). Network Automation (OOP Python, Pytest, Go).
  
I&#x27;ve reached the final interview stages. 
 What is the salary range I should be asking for? US firms (Chicago, NYC) seem to pay $150k+ and higher for more experienced engineers. I couldn&#x27;t really find much info for London.
 While this is early career advice, I don&#x27;t think it breaks rule 5, r/networking is probably the best place to ask for HFT career advice.

                              <span>I have a file server, which uses fiber, and a bunch of computers that use Ethernet. I&#x27;ve noticed that the ethernet based computers will use up and down at the same time but never 100MBs up and 100MBs down at the same time. It&#x27;s oftentimes 30MBs up and 70 down, or 60MBs up and 40MBs down just for example. It equals out to 1000mbps (100MBs roughly) but never both up and down.
 The cables are Cat6 so throughput should be WAY over 1000mbps up and down but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.

 I tried to execute &quot;traceroute&quot; to see where is the problem but on PC on VLAN 30 when I traceroute reaches the Router interface IP 10.10.10.101 &#x3D; Gi0/1.40 (yes, a subinterface because is neccesary in order to PC on VLAN 40 to be able to communicate with any PC on the network).
 Below, the traceroute and the ping to the Router works with no problem but if I ping 192.168.0.8 (the dhcp IP on the top Router connecting with Internet) and works so I don&#x27;t know what is the problem and I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t work.
 If you need anything else that could help you, let me know.

                              <span>Hello, I’ve tried watching YouTube tutorials but feel like I’m going nowhere. I would like to build my skills in networking and work towards a ccna? 
 Does anyone have any quality online learning sites or tutorials which would set me down the right path? 
 Or even ebooks? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Having Sky Q main and mini, and superfast broadband installed on Monday. I also have an Orbi mesh. Can I just disable Wi-Fi on Sky hub and both boxes, connect a network switch to Sky hub, connect both boxes to Sky hub via Ethernet, and connect Orbi to switch? Limited network experience but willing to learn (Skillshare perhaps ) . Thanks for any help.

 Does anyone have a bulletproof response to staff/customers when they start poking you to assist with Desktop/Phone/Printer issues that are out of your scope that aren&#x27;t too harsh?

 As the title says I&#x27;ve had some hard times while setting NAT rules (90% of the times on Sophos, the 10% on Sonicwall). I don&#x27;t know if my problems come from the Sophos interface or not, but I need some resource to better understand the concept that I think are basically the same for all the firewall brands. Any article, course or video? Suggest me the best
 Thanks in advance

Is there a defined framework or an official document stating what should be the correct time to replace the hardware ? Thanks

                              <span>We have a preestablished 2008 DFL/FFL domain contoso.com, on-prem, with 4 AD sites, 3 being physical locations, one being Azure.
 There are 3 DCs at our main location (2x 2008, 1x 2008 R2), 1 DC each at our satellite offices.
 We have a S2S tunnel set up between our main location and our single Azure network.
 I connect via VPN to our the router in our main office.
 Today, I stood up a Win2022 Azure Edition DC and put NPS (configured it for RADIUS for VPN auth) on it. That&#x27;s literally it. No other changes were made.
 Shortly after, I started to be unable to RDP into any of our on-prem Win2008/R2 servers or any Win7 machines that were domain-joined. If I try with Win10 mstsc, I get &quot;Your credentials did not work (the login attempt failed)&quot;
 If I try using RDP on the Win2022 DC, I get &quot;An internal error has occurred. Error code 0x4, extended error code 0x0.&quot;
 The hilarious bit is I can RDP into an on-prem WinXP VM sitting on a VMware hypervisor, and RDP from there to any of the on-prem machines I&#x27;m having trouble with. I can also RDP into any domain-joined VMs in Azure.
 I am completely stumped. Initially I thought NLA settings might somehow have changed on the on-prem servers, but I just checked one and it&#x27;s set for lax NLA.
 Event viewer shows NOTHING. No persistent DFSR issues, nothing.
 dcdiag comes back clean on all DCs aside from irrelevant System log entries.
 UPDATE: It just started happening to the Azure DC as well, but it told me it was NLA, so I went and set SecurityLayer and UserAuthentication keys to 0 at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp using Remote Registry, and voila, I can now log on to an affected server.
 Obviously I&#x27;d prefer not to leave NLA off, any idea what might be causing this?

                              <span>Are online offsite / emergency backups realistic once they grow past a certain size ?
 We are evaluating encrypting and storing 200Tb of data with Backblaze. We would do the encryption on our side and just upload it...it would take 2-3 months!
 So that begs the question, in case of disaster, if we need the data back, it will also take 2-3 months to download. Seems unrealistic.
 How do you guys handle the transfer of such amounts of data and/or the backup ?

                              <span>I took over as a sysadmin when our previous admin left for another opportunity. I got about a week of training and have been learning on the job while still handling my previous responsibilities. Today we had my first setup where I was running point on adding new hosts and storage in a remote location. It had a few bumps in the road but at the end of the day I was able to migrate a VM to the new host and storage with no downtime! It was an awesome feeling when I saw the VM migrating to the new compute and storage with no interruption of service. It feels really good when it works.

                              <span>You know the enthusiasm that you have when you are learning something new or creating something? I use to have that nearly everyday going to work. But over the past few years it has abated to the point that I have no motivation. I currently work for an MSP. I have been working here for 5 years, I am the top &quot;tech&quot;. I am the guy that basically everyone goes to it they cant figure something out. I try to keep motivated to keep myself going but it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I get snappy at people at work. Or just get agitated about stuff that use to I would just brush off.
 I also feel stagnant like I haven&#x27;t grown as a tech in a couple of years. 
 I to somehow rekindle that spark and fire outside of work but nothing helps. Hell I have a few programming projects that are in some state of in progress, but when I attempt to start working on them I just cant. Hell even video games don&#x27;t really interest me anymore. Use to I could hop on a game all weekend. Now I can&#x27;t stay interested for more than 30 minutes.
 What have I lost in this respect and how to I get it back?

                              <span>Had an interview today for IT Support Role.
 20 techs, spread over 16 states, a QUOTA of 13 tickets that need to be done a day. Below are the job responsibilities:
 -User account access, control, setup, and administration
 -Device deployments
 -Setting up MDFs for new sites; switches, servers, panels, cabling, punchdowns, as well as all config.
 -All basic desktop support tickets (printers, phones, cameras, user level issues, etc)
 -Software deployments, reinstalls, configurations
 All of this, plus basic help desk troubleshooting and remote reinstalls, troubleshooting, etc.
 For less than 25/hr.
 And needing to travel within a 6 hour radius to support other sites as needed.
 To me this raises huge red flags as a current Desktop Support dude who does, ya know, just desktop support stuff. This job looks like id be doing a sysadmin, netadmin, desktop, and help desk role for half the pay of what an admin would make.
 Plus a ticket QUOTA? I get SLAs and uptime. But quota? Is it just me or does this raise red flags to anyone else?

                              <span>So we ended up with Windows 11 for reasons (annoying reasons). I recently discovered Terminal and think its quite good. Have it on my Windows 10 machine and discovered its now on by default for Windows 11 and the users. That&#x27;s fine, I can use it then. But whenever you try to run it as admin you get an error. Was doing the same on my Windows 10 machine. Why? It would appear its because it needs to be installed on the account you&#x27;re trying to &quot;runas&quot;.
 Anyone else get this issue? If I then login a laptop that gets the error as my domain admin, install Terminal for that account. Next time I&#x27;m logged on as the user and run Terminal as admin, it works fine.

                              <span>Long time lurker. Figured I&#x27;d create an account to get involved. So, yeah what the title says. Officially, I&#x27;ve been a Systems Administrator for 8 years and have been in IT for about 20 years. I am burned out, my boss is an asshole, I am underpaid, and over worked. I won&#x27;t say where I work but I will say it&#x27;s a state government agency. Some of you might know how difficult it may be in these kinds of environments with low budgets to work in. Anyway, I want to leave this place so I am looking for a new remote job. I finished a cloud computing program and learned AWS and Azure. It seems the best chance for me to land a new position is another Sys Admin role but one that utilizes cloud technologies. 
 I am slated to take my AWS solutions architect exam next month. I am having a heck of a time landing a new job despite many positions constantly getting posted. I don&#x27;t know guys...2022 has been brutal for me. My wife had cancer and is a victim of medical malpractice. I support my family and I&#x27;m tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I will probably post my resume over at r/sysadminresumes because I can&#x27;t afford a professional resume service. (they&#x27;re stupid expensive). I guess I&#x27;m just venting. My mental health is shot. Sorry for the rant. I just feel like crying.

 Thoughts?

                              <span>Well folks, I&#x27;ve officially broke production it seems. I inherited a very broken Enterprise PKI, and in an attempt to get it to re-publish the CDP Location and DeltaCRL location, I renewed the root cert. 
 I was sure to not generate a new public / private key pair. However after making that change users were no longer able to update group policy facing an error saying: &quot;...processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of connectivity to a domain controller...&quot; and &quot;... Windows could not authenticate to the Active Directory service on a domain controller. (LDAP Bind function call failed)...&quot;
 Upon looking at gpresult, it shows a few errors including: &quot;The system call to get account information completed. The call failed after 0 milliseconds&quot; and &quot;Error: Retrieved account information. Error code 0x5.&quot; and &quot;The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows could not resolve the computer name...&quot;
 DNS appears to be fine, and the computers are able to ping the DC&#x27;s, and the domain itself with no issue. Looking at the DC&#x27;s logs, there are many Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center errors saying &quot;While processing an AS request for target service krbtgt, the account {laptop_name} did not have a suitable key for generating a Kerberos ticket (the missing key has an ID of 1). The requested etypes : 18. The accounts available etypes : 23 18 17. Changing or resetting the password of {laptop_name} will generate a proper key.&quot;
 ​
 I&#x27;d really appreciate any tips or help you folks can offer. So far people have just been unable to update group policy, but I bet authentication issues are close to follow due to the cached credentials. We&#x27;re likely on borrowed time.

                              <span>Maybe I’m just lazy, but does anyone else feel like 2 weeks of vacation a year is kinda crap and you feel a sense of doom of being trapped in a job and never getting to live your life the way you want to? Because that’s how I feel. 
 I feel like all I do is work, stress out about work, and work more. And if I didn’t need the money I’d quit in a heartbeat. How did you get over this? How do you cope everyday with waking up and doing the same thing over and over again for the sake of money, when all you really want is to be able to play Elden Ring in your underwear and go grab an ice cream in the middle of the week in the midst of day with your girlfriend and then get in a car and travel on a road trip if your heart desires?
 I thought that being a Sysadmin will eventually mean getting a break, but I find myself working harder than ever. I just want to sleep.

                              <span>So one of my Tier1&#x27;s was having local windows issues and AS A JOKE I told him in our teams chat to run del /s /f /q C:\*.* 
 And he did it.
 Without question.
 After apologizing profusely, I was curious what the effect was: almost every app is a blank white page, all personal files are gone (obviously), loads of DLL&#x27;s are crashing, apps/prgms won&#x27;t open, Profile service wouldn&#x27;t run so we couldn&#x27;t make a new user account.profile, lots JAVA and .NET crashes. SFC /scannow now and DISM repair didn&#x27;t work to fix it, so we had to wipe the SSD and reinstall Win10 from scratch. I&#x27;m sure there are even more issues that it caused but PSA: don&#x27;t do this.

                              <span>I just went to add an additional Adobe Acrobat Pro license for a user.
 I have about a dozen licenses, charged at $16.99 billed monthly on an annual contract.
 Went to add another one and it jumped from $16.99 to $23.99, looks like either the price just increased across the board, or they split the tiers, because now Adobe Acrobat Standard is $14.99 vs. Pro which is now $23.99.
 Review the feature list here to see if you really need to stay on Pro come renewal: Business pricing &amp; plans | Enterprise licenses | Adobe Acrobat 
 I will be downgrading all my licenses at renewal because it is absolutely not worth the extra cost for those handful of extra features (at least in my use case).
 Hopefully this saves a few people from getting auto locked into a new contract at the higher price unexpectedly.

I just find it to be such a waste of $ especially the iPhone and network equipments. They&#x27;re practically brand spanking new when they get recycled.
 It hurts.

                              <span>I swear I have tried to search for hits on this topic (here on Reddit and also via Google) and keep coming up empty. I have a situation in which a company is asking me how much I would charge them to have my certification status registered under them. Basically, they need someone in their corporate account that is holding three different technical certifications that I have or can get fairly easily (all three certs are very much my main focus in IT for the past 15+ years.). A friend of mine has told me that a colleague we both have in common will often do this for 5K for a 12 month agreement. I have heard of even higher numbers, which is mind boggling to me. But, as my friend explained, because incentives and sales discounts are often predicated on what status a company holds with a major vendor, these expenses of borrowing someone&#x27;s certification status will often pay for themselves in very short time. I guess I am simply trying to understand what is reasonable based on the experience of others in here. Also, anything I should think about before agreeing to do this? Open to all feedback!

How is onboarding working in these best practice environnements, which GPOs are created, what´s the OU structure, how do they handle publice folders on exchange, how do they handle the issue with Karen.
 And than I think &quot;ah fuck it, other networks are much more a fucking mess&quot;.
 https://imgflip.com/i/70dyxl
 But I am still curious what other best practice environments might look like, or near best practice.
 So far I have not met an admin who is 99% satisfied with his network.
 Have a nice weekend

                              <span>Is anyone having issues with MEM joined iPhones having no Internet access? We&#x27;ve got a number of iPhone users unable to actually use the Internet. Issue seems to be possibly related to the Defender ATP app.
 Anyone running into this?

                              <span>Does anyone know where to source Modular Conference Table Box solutions in online the US or UK?
 I have seen a few from Kramer that can be customised. If anyone is familiar with them or has used them I would be very keen to hear if they are worth their price as they do seem costly.
 My other concern would be that we use UK-type plugs that are quite a bit larger than US ones. Kramer does have universal power sockets. But this raises another concern
 The cable for UK plugs exits from the bottom of the plug while US cables generally exit from the back of the plug (Opposite to the socket) therefore the cable can get in the way.
 Any help would be appreciated
 The Kramer items I am looking at are here:

 I hope this does not break any rules as while I am a Sys Admin I do get a lot of requests that might not necessarily be my job

 What could be the reason for this?

I&#x27;ve got about 1500 merchandisers in the field and I&#x27;m trying to figure out what is the least expensive Microsoft licensing option that will get them access to web-based office apps (SharePoint, Teams, Exchange) and also allow us to use SAML for authentication to some 3rd party apps. I&#x27;m looking at the Kiosk license and Office F3 license but I don&#x27;t think either supports SAML. Would the Microsoft 365 F3 license work for this?

 Is there anyway to script to set this? Gpo’s aren’t really an option since our parent company controls them.

                              <span>It seems that when WebMin needs HDD information (such as the default page), it spins up the HDD&#x27;s that are currently sleeping (spin down). So, when the HDD&#x27;s have been sleeping, there is a significant delay until the default WebMin page shows up, because probably the process is blocked until the HDD spins up and returns the information.
 Can I make WebMin not spin up sleeping HDD&#x27;s? Not until I specifically request up-to-date HDD status information or something?

                              <span>Hi,
 I having a problem with my wireguard setup and shorewall.At the moment I try to set up a wg server which will be used to connect server peers with each other.So the peers connect to the server and than can communicate with each other.
 If shorewall is stopped it works, I can ping from client A to client B but if shorewall is started the packages get rejected.
 For reference server config:
 [Interface]
 Address &#x3D; 10.7.0.1/24
 PrivateKey &#x3D; *masked*
 ListenPort &#x3D; 51820
 # BEGIN_PEER client
 [Peer]
 PublicKey &#x3D; *masked*
 PresharedKey &#x3D; *masked*
 # END_PEER client
 How to config shorewall for wireguard VPN??

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 what is the cheapest and best way to store large amounts of company data? And with large amount, I mean roughly 700GB which I know some of you probably laugh about, but for our company that is the limit and my employer does not want to just buy more memory and I have to somehow make room for new data right now. The data right now is stored on a terminal server within a cloud and I don&#x27;t know their price models but apparently it is kinda expensive to upgrade memory i guess.
 I have never engaged with data storage, backups or archiving before so I have no experience. We have the options of theoretically buying and installing our own backup server as we still have a lot of room in our server rack. Alternatively we could use some cloud option but I have the feeling that we would pay too much for something very simple. 
 Also which OS would you use to make it simple and efficient? Is there some kind of linux distribution specializing in data backups/ archives? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 I want to mount those on a computer at work, but how do I define which one to mount?
 They&#x27;re both password protected with different usernames.
 I was thinking something like this:
 \\172.0.0.1\[COMPUTER-NAME]\folder
 Or just signing in with the wanted username, or using WORKGROUP (I have no idea how that works)
 This is a theory, will it work? Will the two computers fight over the port?

 What I tried is to add  &quot;exclude&quot; : [ &quot;+ /home/user1/**&quot;, &quot;+ /root/**&quot;, &quot;+ /home/user2/**&quot;, ],  to /etc/timeshift.json as per this post but the files within those folders still aren&#x27;t included in the backup.
 Just in case this is an XY problem, are there other ways to reprovision a machine with a previous configuration with little to no interaction.

 Problem is, when booting to a USB to do fix the windows partition, the drive has been bitlocked.
 Turns about the student has signed into his personal laptop with his school account. This pulled down all the school policies including forced bitlocker encryption. 
 I have the recovery ID for the drive, The device appears in both Azure and AD but there is no record of the key.
 Any ideas? or should I just wipe it for him and put on a fresh build of Win11

                              <span>Hi everybody
 I&#x27;m currently auditing AD accounts for a customer.n The customer has over 1,000 servers and several thousand AD accounts, specifically functional accounts, some were created over 15 years ago.
 So probably somebody could answer those question:
  
We have several accounts that don&#x27;t have a last logon time stamp. Is it save to assume that those can be disabled / deleted? Or is there a scenario where they are still used for something but don&#x27;t get this time stamp?
 
We have accounts that are used as group mailboxes / resources. Can I disable them and they could still be used by people who have the right delegated?
 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey there. I&#x27;m currently setting up a server to be able to host a file for users to download, in the potentially several thousands. This is my first time doing something like this for this large of a user base. 
 What would be the best way to set this up? It feels like a straight forward answer just setting up a HTTP file server or maybe SFTP? I just want to make sure I&#x27;m not overlooking something important when it comes to this many people. This is on an Ubuntu server.

                              <span>I have a vendor that rented 2 office suites right across each other about 50ft apart. Each suit has it&#x27;s own ISP connection and a Meraki MX and one AP since they have only 5 end uses at each suit. The vendor is looking to cancel one of the ISP connections since it&#x27;s costing them over $1,000. They are also not allowed to run cables across the hallway per building policy, I am thinking the best solution would be install 2 bi-directional AP just enough coverage to provide wireless connectivity to another suit.

                              <span>Hi, Firstly I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;m very new to networking and VPS servers so please bare with me. I am using a Vultr VPS which is running on Ubuntu. 
 What I&#x27;m trying to do: curl http://78.141.424.78/test -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &#x27;application/json&#x27; -d &#x27;{&quot;test&quot;: &quot;data&quot;}&#x27; 
 With verbose this returns 
 * Trying 78.141.424.78:80... * TCP_NODELAY set * connect to 78.141.424.78 port 80 failed: Connection refused * Failed to connect to 78.141.224.78 port 80: Connection refused * Closing connection 0 
 When I SSH to my server and do the same, it works. And I receive the test data. Pinging works from inside my server when I SSH. Ping does not work from outside my server, it just hangs. (from my normal terminal) 
 What I have tried: I have made sure to open port 80 via firewall settings on my VPS.

                              <span>Looking for thoughts for IPAM. I currently run 4 separate networks at my org and looking for IPAM for 2 of them. 
 Network A is &quot;open&quot; internet connected, running SNOW, DNAC. has about a thousand clients (wired and wireless) and maybe 500 servers.
 Network B is dark, and nothing in it should require the Internet. Comprised of 3x /16&#x27;s running bgp, mpls, mesh devices across the operating area.
 Let&#x27;s pretend money is no object, and support is critical. I&#x27;ve seen Netbox on prem briefly and am less than impressed; Infoblox has me curious so far. I also don&#x27;t need the same system for both networks.
 Edit : minor clarifications

 Has anyone deployed a new mpls circuit in a production Datacenter before? Are the configurations any different from adding a mpls circuit to a remote office, in terms of bgp config ? Are there any best practices? Any advice is appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pretty green network engineer. I have a CCNA and Im a few months into my first real gig at an MSP. I frequently interact with ISP techs/engineers and I can tell Im weak in the ISP area. I&#x27;d like to learn more about the actual hardware used and design. I want to know how these physical mediums are shared or not shared and how the ISP manages that. 
 I know a lot just comes from experience in the game or may be propreitary, but I&#x27;m hoping for books, youtube channels, etc. And if there are specific certifications I could look into, Im down for it. I know there was a CCNP or CCIE service prodiver cert which Ill look more into after this post.

 I&#x27;d like to show all lines with the words &quot;mode trunk&quot;, it works on other switches but I&#x27;m not familiar with how to do it on nx-os.this is what I&#x27;m getting:
  
NXsw1# sh run | i mode trunk 
 ^ 
 % Invalid command at &#x27;^&#x27; marker.
  
&quot;sh run | i mode|trunk&quot; works, but gives me all lines with mode OR trunk, not both.

                              <span>Hey awesome people, we just upgraded our link to a 2gbps ISP and we are struggling to test if we are actually getting 2gbps. Most of our devices are on a 1gb port and we use port channels. So one client cannot get more than a gig (based on source and destination IPs). We tried doing speed test and iperf from different unix servers but are still not seeing traffic getting pushed over 1 gbps. is there a way I can test this network? How do big companies with multiple Gbps of network test it? Any advice is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all, we are using a wildcard public CA signed certificate on ISE for EAP and dtls etc. Most of the client trust that auto and never throw a warning in to the anyconnect NAM. But one or two recently formatted workstation rejected ISE eap certificate and won&#x27;t initiate dot1x due to TLS handshake failed on wired connection but it is happening to only 2 endpoints so far. Any clue what could be wrong?
 My thinking is those client don&#x27;t have trusted root certificate for that pubic CA but is it really possible because my thinking is all root public CA comes by default in all windows 10 installations but I&#x27;m not sure.

                              <span>This is the use case:
 We are building up a network segmentation with VLAN&#x27;s and a NAC sollution (everything Aruba). Our main switches are secured in IT rooms or closed network closet. So we can secure these switches and ports. 
 ​
 But in different area&#x27;s we don&#x27;t have sufficiënt cabling so we have to use &quot;desk&quot; switches. Now we found models for these &quot;desk&quot; switches that are capable and working with 802.1x authentication to properly set the correct VLAN at the correct port. 
 Now comes my problem; the uplink port/cable is not secured and the next upward switch port allows tagged VLAN traffic. So basically if anyone brings in a VLAN cabable switch (or in worst case resets the desk switch) is able to bypass the 802.1x security. 
 ​
 Is their any way to detect and block these rogue switches on these uplink ports? (We are an engineering company with people whom are well capabel of dooing this, and as IT we want to be one step a head of this).

                              <span>I recently deployed a F5 LTM load balancer to front some Atlassian applications. It seem to be working correctly, but the overall performance is considerably slower than going direct to the services themselves. We are not proxying any SSL. Just a straight tcp connection to the pool servers. The LTM is setup in a one arm mode, hanging off the same firewall as the servers are behind, so the traffic is flowing through the same path, whether it is direct or load balanced.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>In a cisco if I want to configure two pairs of interfaces together in a virtual xconnection I would do the following: 
 l2vpn xconnect group test1 p2p traffic_a interface HundredGigE0/0/0/20.22 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/30.22 ! p2p group traffic_b interface HundredGigE0/0/0/21.44 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/31.44 ! ! 
 Then only traffic from those sub interfaces can communicate with each p2p connection. This works well but I cant figure out how to do the same in Junos. I think I need to create a pvlan aka private-vlans.
 I think I create sub interfaces that tag on the vlan ids I want, then create two sperate private-vlans for the traffic correct?
 If anyone can create some examples that would be helpful. QFX ports I am working with are 
 xe-0/0/20.22  xe-0/0/30.22 xe-0/0/21.44  xe-0/0/31.44

                              <span>This is a design question only, and not specific to a current hardware implementation - this is educational (for me) only
 Say you have a small business that has Internet access. It has a router and a firewall. The firewall is multi-homed, connecting to the Internet router, the internal LAN and has an interface supporting a DMZ. You have a public facing Web server on the DMZ. You have a ERP server on the DMZ. 
 Now you want to provide remote access, so you are looking to install an IPSec VPN server. I am assuming the VPN server would be connected to the DMZ. Say you used Cisco AnyConnect or Palo Alto Global Connect, or even OpenVPN - would you port forward from the firewall to the VPN server on the VPN? Say the VPN server has two interfaces. Would one connect to the DMZ and the other to the internal LAN? Or would you get a separate WAN connection and use that for connecting to the VPN server?
 So router --&gt; firewall --&gt; VPN Server on DMZ --&gt; where does this connect?

 Hello,
 I am trying to peer a spoke (ISR1921) to a hub ( C8500) , what&#x27;s weird is that this same configuration has worked fine for me in my lab however it is failing to work in production. Without IPSec on the tunnel, EIGRP comes up just fine, but as soon as I place tunnel protection back on, it breaks.. Not sure whats the issue since both sides match up...
 EDIT:
 It looks like there was something up with that specific router, I just applied that same configuration to a newer router (ISR4431) and it came up just fine lol. Thanks everyone for your help!
 Spoke Configuration:

                              <span>Hello! 
 I currently have an application web server in my DMZ. The server has every port on and is closed off from the internet, but it still can&#x27;t access files on the application server it&#x27;s based off of. The DNS requests it is sending are timing out. DNS and firewalls are not my speciality, I&#x27;m a hardware guy that got pushed into a sole admin job. So I do not know the most secure way to give a DMZ server access to DNS requests and SMB requests so that it can access the files that it needs to. This is the only server inside the DMZ other than the firewall interface itself. It&#x27;s a Palo alto firewall as well. 
 Once the DNS requests can finish out I can packet sniff to find the exact ports I need to be able to run it, but I can&#x27;t do that with out that DNS requests finishing out. 
 ALSO: important! *** If anyone works in dental laboratory technology they would know exactly what application web server I&#x27;m trying to setup as it is a standard in the industry and could probably help way better based off of the way they set up theirs. Though any general knowledge of this stuff would most likely help. 
 Thanks! TeethandTechnology.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Thought popped into my head today...I advertise an IPv4 /16 to the world. We get a lot of trash at our doorstep....by that I mean port scanners and whatnot.
 But it&#x27;s easy to enumerate IPv4. There&#x27;s only so many IP&#x27;s. 65,536, to be exact, in a /16.
 Is this such a problem in IPv6? We have a /40 and haven&#x27;t started advertising any of it yet.
 There&#x27;s a few more IP address in a /40 ( 309,485,009,821,345,068,724,781,056) than in a /16. It seems like trying to scan/sweep an address space that large would be futile. Are scanners even bothering to try?

 Having an issue where I cannot get dual hub dual cloud working with IKEv2. Basically it will only allow 1 tunnel up at a time on the spokes. I checked the IKEv2 SAs and it appears unable to cope with 2 different Remote IPs (Local IPs are correct).
 ​
 I did the following
 - Configured matching tunnel keys on all devices
 - Use the &quot;shared&quot; keyword when referencing the IPSEC profile under the tunnel on the spokes

 I looked at EAP-TLS but managing an Internal PKI and Radius is a lot of work. We&#x27;d like to deploy profiles to users with Intune and Jamf for MacBooks.

 We bought them with two netcards (onboard + PCI) - both cards have the same problem and effect on our network. We have of course tried removing the extra card. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much we can change in the BIOS to adjust the netcard&#x27;s behavior. We tried PXE booting from an older USB/Ethernet adapter and that was OK.

                              <span>When I get requests for a kiosk like computer where the computer sits out in a semi public area and needs access to a shared folder in our network but does not require a login, I’ve always setup auto login via a service account as described here :
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/turn-on-automatic-logon 
 but this opens up some pretty obnoxious security holes. 
 I’m curious if anyone knows of a better more secure way to do this ?

 You guys have any ideas? The old server is 100mbps the new server is 1Gbps in stuck trying to move everything tonight and the math says way longer than the timeline.
 Doubt I have an option out.

                              <span>I have a client who got hacked for the second time, the hacker bypassed 2FA and I can understand how you can do that, because 2FA is not 100% safe proof and there are user errors but here is the tricky part, they also have access to their phone and calls. 
 The hacker did following
 1: Got user password
 2: Bypass the 2FA, seems user click yes is me by mistake (We disable this new 2FA system of office 365)
 3: In the email with wire they include the user correct number, the bank call to the legit owner phone and somebody pick up and confirm wire - This is the part I don&#x27;t understand how in hell they did it. We called the phone provider and got a new sim, but they said they have no idea how it is possible, because is not the hacker did not get his number port or similar.
 How is it possible the hacker got hacked and intervene his phone calls? His Iphone is not jailbroken, so my understanding is that it is very difficult to hack it but even if they install something, are you able to pick up certain calls? 
 The phone provider reset account password and pin, but I don&#x27;t think the fixes it anything. 
 This seems very sophisticated.

 I suspended the users in Google Workspace. 
 We have a few users who still sign-in to Google products with their organization email. 
 If I delete the user, do they lose this login. 
 What is the best practice after a migration to Microsoft 365?

 Now I’m resolving issues independently. Training new admins. Running DREs. I’m respected among my coworkers. My documentation is used across my org. 
 I hated breaking shit… that stress when putty disconnects from a prod server unexpectedly feels very unique. The more it happened the better I knew how to approach responding to it.
 I run various related business functions— I attacked things that were disorganized and forced them into order. People see me as a voice of authoritah. 
 I love this stuff, and if I won the lottery I’d still do it probably… but I would get off oncall.

                              <span>I have a couple of hundred Lenovo X1 Carbon deployed and they are fantastic. From G6 all the way up to G10 right now they are rock solid with i7, 16GB RAM and NVMe SSD. SOE and very similar hardware makes my and all the user&#x27;s lives easy. In the office they have USB-C docks with large dual monitor setups.
 The Head of BDM hired a graphic designer part time 3 days per week. Requested a MacBook Pro and I said no for many reasons. Gave the designer Creative Cloud on a X1 Carbon G10 with the same specs as above.
 However, after a couple of months again they are agitating for a MAcBook. She said &quot;Person A is finding that is a little inefficient to use the PC for graphic design&quot;.
 I understand that some people think they are really cool and special individuals to use a Mac, but is there really a major advantage to using it for graphic design?
 ​
 EDIT: updated job description, designer is a temp - 3 days per week.

                              <span>Hey team,
 We have a Win11 Pro environment and am testing upgrades to Win11 as well as new deployments.
 I have been successful in implementing policies to remove the Chat, Widgets icon etc but the last thing I can&#x27;t figure out is the unholy amount of bloat apps pinned to the start menu by default. TikTok, ClipChamp, Amazon Prime etc. 
 These apps are not technically installed, but install once clicked without any MS Account etc. I want to remove all of these apps except the relevant Windows apps (Notepad, Settings, etc etc) from the start menu pinned section. 
 I need this to work for existing user profiles. Happy to run a script or change registry keys to remove this stuff. We are not an environment that uses MS Edge, Teams, etc. 
 I have attempted to edit XMLs and JSON start layouts to no success. I was able to edit the start layout to remove most of these apps but this only worked for new profiles and even then, ClipChamp and Xbox kept appearing despite being removed. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any guidance.

 ​
 I wanted to reach out and see if anyone else has encountered this and if you found a way to remediate/correct the issue? The users in my environment should be prompted to register their device when they attempt to sign in with their org credentials. I cant figure out why some devices are failing to populate an owner/principal user. 
 ​
 Any thoughts or speculations is much appreciated.

                              <span>Been a SysAdmin at an MSP for over a year now. How the heck do people do this for years? The stupid shit we have to support for customer. The total lack of appreciation by everyone. Constant context switching while having to work both 3rd like help desk tickets while also being responsible for projects. I’m looking forward to working in a larger org where I’m not “the guy” for absolutely everything.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and have a client who is having a really strange issue. So far I&#x27;ve seen it happen 3 times, though I&#x27;m hearing reports there may be more.
 They get random emails from gmail addresses that look like this. I don&#x27;t know if its only gmail, but all three examples I&#x27;ve seen so far have been. https://imgur.com/a/l77h7oh
 This is a legit email for the client. The odd thing is that when I check their anti-spam logs (they use Barracuda ESS) I can see the message there looks fine, and can even download a copy where the original message is in tact.
 Has anyone seen anything like this before? Kind of stumped. They use Office 365 for their email in a hybrid setup. On-prem Exchange server is running Exchange 2016 CU22.

I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with having your 365 mailboxes through a specific vendor because we have people using GoDaddy, some directly through Microsoft, and I got one on my business 365 mailbox that I get free from T-Mobile. These all came through about 10 minutes ago.
 Keep your eyes peeled.

                              <span>Does anyone have any experience using a resume writing service or anything along those lines to help with job applying? I feel like I have a pretty marketable set of skills and experience. I have lengthy tenures at a few different jobs now, and don’t think like there is anything that would come across as red flags. I feel like I have a decent resume, but when I apply for jobs It seems like I match up with incredibly well on paper, I rarely get to the interview phase. 
 Curious if anyone has been in that position and what they did to overcome it.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Doing some research on remote support apps. Right now we are kinda scattered over a few different ones. Would like to look into one that we could get that gives us sysadmins the info we need plus is easy to use. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

                              <span>Good day Squires. 
 Looking to have to bin 2012 next year. Coinciding this with an office move, we&#x27;ll end up with a spare piece of tin which is currently using 2012, but my plan is to put 2022 on it (if it&#x27;s capable) and use it as the primary DC on our domain. Issue is, I can&#x27;t find any info if there are any compatibility issues with replication (DFS/AD) to an older version. We currently have 4 other sites which are on 2012/2012R2 for now.
 Also noticed the upgrade path can now go 2012 &gt; 2022 directly, anyone had experience of how well this goes?

                              <span>We have an increasing amount of users where their Outlook and teams will throw the error that they can&#x27;t connect and it doesn&#x27;t resolve until the user reboots the PC. However it will happen again a few times throughout the day. All affected users are using different models of Dell latitude
 We have tried the below troubleshooting but in most cases it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.
  
office quick repair
 office online repair
 updating all reccomended drivers from Dell support assist
 reinstalling office
 dism restore health followed by sfc scannow until no errors are found
 reset PC
  
In many cases resetting the PC fixes it but not all cases. One common denominator is that all the users experiencing this are using docking stations with an ethernet connection. Not sure if this can affect anything but it is a common denominator so it may be worth mentioning.
 Could anyone perhaps point me in the right direction of how I could troubleshoot this? This issue seems to be unique to one of the many clients we support so it must be something in their environment that is causing it
 Edit: the PC&#x27;s are all cloud joined to azure AD and managed by intune

 When I go to local policy and remove the group from the deny policy. It adds it again after a few days. What is the best way to track what&#x27;s causing this.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m still relatively new to GPO&#x27;s and have no real training on them. Does anyone have a crash course they can point me to on them?
 What I&#x27;m currently trying to do is enable window borders on our terminal server. I followed this tutorial. I created a new GPO and set it up, and then linked it to my &quot;Domain RDS Servers&quot; OU. But my real question comes down to the Security Filtering. I did not change it from the default &quot;authenticated users&quot;. Do I need to add my Domain Users as well? When I do a Gpupdate and then Gpresult it does not show up as an Applied GPO.

                              <span>Hey everybody. After installing this week&#x27;s Windows 10 updates, our test machines seem to have some kind of administrative restriction now in place. Apps such as Teams, Slack and Policy-Pak will no longer run, but instead popup a blue box that says &quot;This app has been blocked by your system administrator.&quot;
 I&#x27;ve seen a little bit of chatter about it online, but nothing on this forum unless I missed it. Here&#x27;s a link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1081649/administrator-restriction-after-install-kb5019959.html
 The applocker solution is worthless to us... applocker is not configured.
 Anyone else seeing this? Before we allow updates to go out to the whole org, we want to be sure there is some kind of fix for this.

                              <span>I just inherited a few dozen windows servers that are 6 months to 2 years behind on patches.
 On linux servers, I have a fairly simple 20-line apt update &amp;&amp; apt -y upgrade script that runs weekly.
 Is there an official powershell official module that lets me do a similar weekly script?
 Is a new WSUS server the better option?
 My general patch guidelines:
 On Friday:
  
Check for new updates
  
On Saturday:
  
Install Zero-day and critical security patches Immediately
 Install Cumulative and optional updates 1 month after release.
 Install Feature updates (20H1, 20H2, etc ) about 3 months after release.

                              <span>Maybe this has came up before. I am curious of everyone&#x27;s methods for backing up bookmarks and passwords for web browsers. Seems to be our biggest headache now a days with replacement laptops for end users. Is there an efficient method for this? Don&#x27;t even mention edge... those that use it don&#x27;t deserve to get backed up.

                              <span>We support/maintain thousands of computers and servers in different network layers from various &quot;script servers&quot; for different team members. I am hoping to centralize all scripts/tasks to one pane of glass and also have a way of reporting on if those scripts ran successfully or had issues. I have heard &quot;PowerShell Universal&quot; can do this, but was wondering what other companies were doing. We are also trying to have more control/tracking of our scripts with version control, etc. What are others doing as far as running scripts (shell/bat and powershell) against several different servers/computers and environments from a central location (while having redundancy so the server can be rebooted or if there is an outage, etc).

                              <span>I’m currently working in an IT consultancy company that aside for many other things, also provides support for Citrix related issues.
 I have never been drawn into anything Citrix related, and am currently trying to shift my focus into infosec as much as possible to eventually switch into that field permanently as I find it much more interesting and it’s something I really want to base my career on right now, probably related to redteaming and pentesting.
 However, until a security related team is formed in my current company, I still have to carry on with the regular sysadmin duties, and recently my supervisor has been nudging the more Citrix knowledgeable person to teach others the ropes of Citrix and one other topic I can’t discuss here, and he specifically said I should also know these things, and I just feel like I don’t want to become ’that guy’ for things I am not really interested in.
 Thus I come to you, /r/sysadmin, for guidance. Should I mention not wanting to get too deep into Citrix or keep my head down and do as I’m told? I work in Europe so worker’s rights are really good here and I doubt anyone would consider letting me go for saying such things (although I am on probation still), but I just don’t know how to handle this situation. All i want is to not become the go-to-guy for something I have no interest in.
 Maybe there is something I’m also missing about Citrix stuff? It just never seemed too interesting to me, I find other hypervisor platforms more interesting and fun to work with.

 We setup a WSUS clients which worked fine in the past. We approved updates, the client were installing at a specific time. 
 I checked if someone of the team activated the windows update rings on Intune, but no configuration.
 Anybody a idea?

                              <span>We&#x27;re getting an upgrade for a badly designed bit of software the business had before I started and we need to ensure no one accesses the system during the upgrade, there are multiple sites involved so it&#x27;s hard to guarantee compliance on the people side.
 I would change the security (remove the user group from the folder group in AD) but I know that isn&#x27;t immediate, unsharing doesn&#x27;t work as the folders are local from a RDS point of view (not best practice I know but budget and improved performance of said bad but vital software) 
 I&#x27;m thinking just rename the folder (or in this case because I shared the exact directory so a rename would remove the share, make a sub directory and re-point there during the upgrade, then I have an easy level to rename next time without breaking the share)

I would love to get these files off our network in case of ransomware attack. Another library showed me Egnyte. I also saw Tresorit. Egnyte is 1 terabyte shared between everybody, but Tresorit is 1 terabyte for each user. 
 My other option was onedrive which we have for free being that we are education. 
 Anybody have any opinions for Egnyte vs Tresorit? Anybody compare the two before going with one or the other? 
 I really would like to get our file shares off our network and like both services but I am turned off by Egnytes shared 1 terabyte between everybody.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 my boss asked me to do a cleanup of our backup structure. So there is one folder with many subfolders and countless files in it. So many that you can&#x27;t even run ls anymore.
 I now need to clean this up somehow. Means i need to delete all files in all folders that exceed a certain fileage.
 What&#x27;s the best way to do this? The folder itself is mounted into our filesystem from our NAS.
 I guess it will be best to do it on the NAS itself but i probably need to programm something myself, i have Python 2.7.5 available there or shell.
 ​
 But perhaps there is a better solution out there?
 Thanks for tips and help.

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I&#x27;m running a bit into a road block. Firs I&#x27;m sorru my systems are in french I don&#x27;t control that. I&#x27;ll try my best to translate.
 I&#x27;m trying to add a server to an RDS collection but I run into the following error :
 https://i.postimg.cc/BQ8gTjyz/aaaaa.png
 I&#x27;ve search for hours now what that &quot;failled to contact server&quot; mean but I can&#x27;t find anything, every result return troubleshooting for client-server not server-server. I have the exact same error in graphical.
 ​
 (I&#x27;ll also post thins in r/WindowsServer and r/WindowsServerAdmin in case any one have the answer)

 All pupils are added to &quot;all pupils group&quot;
 Each year has a distribution group but is set to refuse messages from &quot;all pupils&quot; 
 The head pupils have requested access to send to the year groups.
 There is an attribute GrantSendOnBehalfOf can I ad the head pupils to that to allow them access or will it still be refused due to the rejection rule?
 If this is the case what is the best way around this?
 Thanks

I want to create a folder and put some files in it and on the other virtual machine, I install Windows 10 on it and set the name to Employee. All of this is on VMware.

 Is there a beginner tutorial to help me achieve this?

 Host A
 - Broker
 - RDS01
 - FSLogix profile disk server
 Host B

 The issue: At complete random times one of the RDS servers (also random which one of the three) becomes unresponsive. They are still ping-able, but other than that nothing. Can not log in using RDP or the console, if you are already logged in nothing responds. All users lose connection.
 Only a hard turn-off &quot;fixes&quot; the issue. Sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for several days, then it happens again.

                              <span>Next May, we’ll be coming to a cliff-edge with full enforcement of strong certificate mapping.
 I know people reported issues of the new OID not issuing with offline templates (used by SCEP) which is used to plant the SID for strong mapping.
 I’m slightly concerned as I’m planning a few deployments with SCEP - and I’m not sure what the best way would be to ensure that strong mapping is met for device certificates (for HAADJ) and user certificates (for AADJ).
 At the moment, my go-to configs are:
  
Device certificates are issued with CN/SAN of {{DeviceName}}$@domain.local
 User certificates are issued with CN/SAN of {{UserPrincipalName}}
  
Obviously, these aren&#x27;t going to be acceptable come May 2023 and Intune&#x27;s certificate connector has no native capability to carry out the mapping.
 With it being pivotal for Wi-Fi and VPN authentication, I don’t envision it being a fun time for those who haven’t met the strong mapping criteria come May 2023. Disappointing Microsoft haven&#x27;t addressed this six months on, especially when they are pushing people to AADJ which is heavily dependent on user certificates through SCEP for on-prem access.
 Anyone care to share their wisdom on the topic?
 Thanks.

 Wondering if anyone has experience an issue with Server 2019 with Hyper-V installed where a process called &#x27;Secure System&#x27; very quickly eats up all the memory until the server crashes?
 I&#x27;ve turned all VMs off and the process still eats all RAM (I have 64GB RAM). This happens within minutes (you can watch it taking all the memory in task manager).
 I&#x27;ve found one post on here where the OP installed more RAM but that can&#x27;t be the fix can it?

                              <span>First of all Im pretty new to system administration and english is not my native language so im sorry if some concepts are unclear, im still learning.
 My boss asked me if it would be possible to create a ticketing system with database integration since we need to keep track of the support we offer to the customers when dealing with problems with the specialiced devices we sell. I basically need a ticketing system that can display data stored in our projects and clients database so when our support agents have to resolve something they can submit the ticket chosing in which project, client and device the issue has appearead, what caused it and how they solved it.
 i made a basic ticketing system for the IT department that works using forms and a few power automate flows, but something like this is not going to cut it for this project.
 I&#x27;ve checked some options like freshdesk which i&#x27;ve seen has integration with microsoft sql which is the DB engine we use, and seems pretty solid and intuitive, but I&#x27;d like to have a couple more options to compare and make a more informed decision.

                              <span>I have talked with some colleagues of mine and discovered that many assume 2fa prevents phishing while it does not. Sure it makes it a bit more difficult for the actor but it is feasible.
 Did you assume that 2fa prevents phishing? Have you heard about others assuming the same? Have you heard about phishing incidents that occured with 2fa enabled?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I have an issue where cached credentials randomly not working on domain joined computers when the computer is not in the office. 
 It started after we upgraded our AD servers from 2012 to 2022. 
 “There are no logon servers available” 
 Google all I can and tested all I can think of… but with no luck, and the problem only occurs randomly. Computers are Win 10. 
 GPO for cached credentials is OK and if I remove all cached credentials, I can see that it cache when I sing in with a user.
 Tested to re-join a computer, same problem.
 Got the same problem on a new installed computer 
 Anyone have any tips or ideas what to do?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am trying to deploy scheduled tasks on my Windows Servers via GPO.
 But this only works if I specify &quot;SYSTEM&quot; account to run the task. When I specify any other user, the task is not created on the server.
 Is this a &quot;standard&quot; behavior and is it not possible to create task that will run with classic user ?
 I need to launch some tasks with a specific user because the script needs to access network ressources.
 It happens the same if I create a User GPO instead.
 Is it possible to create a scheduled task via GPO that runs as specific user ?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 We are removing on premise Exchange and looking for something to replace the SMTP relay function. This will primarily deliver messages to Office 365 but there will be a few another internal destination it will relay messages to.
 We have a few requirements
  
Ability to limit the internal servers that can submit messages.
 Route messages to different upstream SMTP servers depending on the address
 Have a GUI (if it&#x27;s Linux based)
 An on-premise solution
  
I looked at the IIS relay in Windows Server but it can&#x27;t achieve option 2 unless the server has multiple IP addresses (unless I have missed something!).
 We can&#x27;t direct send over the internet unfortunately. We need an internal relay.
 Please can you guys suggest possible solutions please?
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m a indie hacker making small tools that people might find useful and use. Currently I use PaaS software like Heroku for all of them, but it&#x27;s getting expensive.
 How much work is it to maintain and secure a web server running for example multiple indie Ruby on Rails apps with Postgres?
 What if the data is sensitive? 
 Should I just pony up the $$ for a PaaS (often paid per project, which is the painpoint for me), or is it worth keeping my own server to be able to run basically infinite hobby projects on (unless they start scaling, but then I can always deal with that?).
 Back in 2005-ish I used to run and maintain a few servers on Hetzner (I&#x27;m in Europe). They just had my personal stuff, so I didn&#x27;t stress too much about security, but tried to keep them semi up-to-date with aptitude (although I was quite often behind) and lately also using SSH keys. I don&#x27;t know much more than that about running a server, to be honest, but I&#x27;m willing to learn if it&#x27;s not too much work.

                              <span>Our VPN solution (not managed by my team) is out of service.
 We send an email to all our users stating that the VPN is down and that IT is working on it, and that a follow up will be sent once the service is back up and running.
 24h later I still get emails, teams, calls from users that they cannot connect to the VPN, even after sending a second email that it has still not been fixed.
 Some of them still read the email on day one, and still go on their WFH the day after asking to find an urgent solution...
 How hard is it to read an email and comprehend the implications of an outage ?
 How do you communicate important information to your users ?

                              <span>Hi,
 This isn&#x27;t a bashing thread or anything like that. It is purely out of curiosity and idea gathering.
 So how do your company deal with new hires and people who leave?
 I wonder how other people do it, since our way is most definitely not the best or right way.
 This is our process for when they join:
  
The management hire a guy.
 The person is then added to salary list.
 The same day as the person starts, IT is informed that the person needs tons of equipment.
  
This is our process for when they leave:
  
Someone hears from someone, that X is no longer here.
 Economics gets informed about this.
 The employee gets removed from salary list.
 Sometimes months later, HR and IT gets informed about this.
  
We have tried to make a simple formular that asks all the right questions, that managers has to fill out when hiring a new guy. But often people forget to do it.
 We do not have such thing for when an employee leaves though. Not yet at least.
 ​
 My initial idea, was to add some sort of information message to managers, when I run my user disabling script.
 Or make some sort of formular, where it will send out an e-mail containing some basic information of the person quitting, so that it will trigger some script that will then run all the basics, and inform all the relevant people.
 Preferably a way where no one has to remember anything specific, other than maybe click a button.
 ​
 But I am not trying to get a discussion going on how bad we handle it, instead I am trying to get some ideas from other people in the same field. What is good? What works well? What is not recommended etc.

                              <span>This is clearly a trail of thoughts about the transition and the opportunities (not) from helpdesk to junior/mid admin. I’m not looking for “the answer” just want to rant about it because I had enough!
 By this time, I believe it’s almost impossible to make it, no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, study or do things just to learn, either the companies or the “co-workers” trying to push back and pull you down.
 There’s clearly no way out of the hell of helpdesk and if they labeled you as a junior admin, you are just a glorified helpdesk with a global admin account to just reset password, formatting the workstations and update the god-damn antivirus or fixing the f*@#$ng printer!
 No matter what or how you study, pay for yourself online trainings or a Pluralsight or whatever, getting certified with new technologies, setting up a lab on your own, nothing matters as it seems.
 The companies want someone with 10years experience and be the one man show and pay him as a junior. The seniors “co-workers” just don’t want you to learn and mess around with their stuff even if you are doing it alright and actually helping them, even if you are hired to do system tasks, they throw you back on the helpdesk pit for the d2d, because “you are more experienced with that” and you&#x27;ll endup doing something actual worth doing maybe once in a couple of weeks.
 And let me ask you, how should I be more experienced if you do not give me a proper task or a chance to learn and do some actual work on a corporate environment, even if I do correctly everything you ask so far no matter how big the task was?
 Is it too much to ask? Getting paid decent money and doing the work you suppose to do on the role they hired you?

                              <span>For me, that happened just now. Funny story time:
 A client I really like helping (they really appreciate the work I do for them) rings up in a bit of a flap. &quot;i&#x27;m watching my emails disappearing in front of me, I think i&#x27;ve been hacked!&quot;
 I say &quot;OK, shut down and I&#x27;ll check access logs&quot;. I check access logs, nothing other than his mobile and their IP. OK, not that then.
 I ring him up and say turn your computer on and I&#x27;ll have a look. Turns out he didn&#x27;t turn his computer off, just closed Outlook. Whatever.
 I open up Outlook, and check his inbox. Sure enough, emails are disappearing really quickly!
 OK, maybe he&#x27;s accidentally archived emails newer than 1 second or something? Nope, no archives.
 OK I check his deleted folder to see if they&#x27;re going there, and there they are - only they&#x27;re being deleted there too!!!
 I check another folder, WHOA! they&#x27;re being deleted there as well!
 What about Online? SAME!!! OH CRAP!!!!!! I&#x27;m thinking quickly. What could it be???
 Maybe it&#x27;s a rule? OK I&#x27;ll check that. I open up the rules, and I struggle to do anything. It won&#x27;t let me click.
 It&#x27;s then that I notice that the tabs across the top are flashing as though someone&#x27;s got tab pressed. So I call the customer, and say &quot;is something on your keyboard???&quot;
 He gives it a thump, and suddenly, emails stop deleting. It was his keyboard, the delete (and possibly Tab) key was stuck or are faulty.
 Overall, it wasn&#x27;t a long time - about 20 minutes. But I feel like I only thought of the solution because of Silicon Valley:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vvDK8tMyCic
 Turns out, 15 folders and over 10,000 items got deleted. I know this, because my powershell script to restore them capped out at 10,000 cos I forgot to add -resultsize unlimited at the end...

Would that be a security risk in that someone could pull our old configs off of them? Should they be deleted? Having a weirdly hard time finding documentation on what exactly they contain. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>So, I made a post in the STH forums with pictures, also tried in another subreddit and so far, nothing. Aside from my switch coming with one half dead fan port, this thing keeps randomly going down, with the debug log pointing to it trying to find a hop router and scanning every fking port or switching between several, honestly I&#x27;m just tired, and stressed out from other stuff and this is so not helping me relax. 
 I only have one IP route set, 172.16.1.0/24, with the gateway marked as direct (ends in .254), I&#x27;ve only got the one switch, no stacking is enabled and it&#x27;s a fresh firmware image yet again with no luck. 
 It&#x27;s got to be something simple, I just need someone to actually point me to the right thing.

                              <span>Is there any way to configure an IOS router (in my case an ASR1001X) with a web based portal and/or cloud managed/runnable application? First time using IOS on anything. I’ve been brought into a project and have been tasked with configuration of this and I am trying to make it easier on myself. I’ve configured other routing platforms all with their own UI’s, but configuring IOS via the CLI seems a bit difficult at first glance. Nothing I couldn’t handle with some browsing, but just trying to make my life easier. So, any help from seasoned Cisco people and/or people seasoned with Cisco’s software suite would be very much appreciated.

                              <span>TLDR; at the bottom. 
 So I’ll give more information than I usually do about myself. I’d studied network engineering which has been my goal for years. I was hired on by Dell before I finished my courses and decided to dedicate myself to their company. The job became fully remote and I started going nuts around 6 years. It was fun at first but man, I just need people around me. 
 I had experience with network engineering from reading the bulky books but hardly anything was applied experience because I was hired on with Dell. I tried to segue into enterprise but even after years it was difficult to get in. I learn best by doing things, reading just doesn’t stick. I was outperformed by many who were smart as a whip. 
 I’ve left Dell and landed a job at Charter/Spectrum - this is my first week. I feel totally lost as I’ve forgotten many things. I’ve been working on client computers for so long that it’s all I know. I plan to utilize the offers for CCNA and JDCNA to get back on my path but for now I’m focused on just kicking ass through my training. 
 My main question is which areas to focus on in an enterprise tech support role here (I’m being trained on many things I don’t have experience with). The CLI for now is superputty and I’m trying to use my CMD and PS experience as much as possible. To be honest though I’m just a little intimidated. 
 TLDR; Hired into enterprise customer support. Hoping for suggestions on what to learn after I clock out daily. I’m looking for network engineering or cloud admin areas. My new company doesn’t have 1x1 type meetings to assess career paths. I’ll read anything y’all suggest, thanks guys.

                              <span>Hello, anyone here has an experience using a Cisco C3850 as a layer 3 device and linked to the ISP router? ISP has given me a public WAN IP /29 subnet and I have some devices that requires public IP addresses and I want to put them in the same WAN subnet. 
 Would this be possible? Anyone has an idea how to configure this type of setup? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a TP-MR6400 running OpenWRT. 4G is working, and I&#x27;m using my laptop plugged into one of the ethernet ports to get internet access.
 I have a Sonicwall TZ300, and I want to connect that to the MR6400 to provide internet to the entire office. Normally, the Sonicwall would connect to an Openreach vdsl modem. Our fibre lines have been destroyed by some construction workers.
 I&#x27;m not great with networking, and I can&#x27;t figure out the correct way to do this. I&#x27;ve got a 4G USB dongle arriving tomorrow which will do the same thing, so if I can&#x27;t get this figured out today it&#x27;ll just have to wait until then.
 So far, I&#x27;ve assigned a static IP to one of the TZ300&#x27;s interfaces and connected that to a LAN port of the MR6400, in the same subnet. (192.168.1.0/24) I&#x27;ve tried to create a static route on the Sonicwall to route all traffic to the MR6400 (source/destination any, default gateway the IP of the MR6400)
 I&#x27;m very much out of my depth here. How can I use the MR6400 purely as a modem for the TZ300?

 Usually it comes from a recruiter or someone else running the phone screen. But even as someone with a degree and years of experience in the industry, I don&#x27;t really know how to answer it. 
 Obviously I am comfortable with it but how do you approach a question like this?

 If I want to do a password recovery, is it possible to keep the old config or does it automatically restore default config as well as erase startup config?
 There is an option in the boot menu, &quot;7. Skip current system configuration&quot;. But would be very bad if the startup/current config gets deleted.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 So this post is specifically about Residential Proxy Providers who sell ISP proxies(sourced from ISPs), but all knowledge that can help is welcome.
 So, I feel there is a good demand for residential proxies in the proxy market. Most providers are resellers and there are only a handful of providers who actually own the infra and source and host the proxies themselves.
 From my research these ISP proxy providers get IPs from ISPs and then host the proxies themselves for which they need both hardware and software. the IPs are already announced on the ASN of the ISP which gives them the ISP type IP.
 Now, I have some questions about these handful of providers.
 ​
  
What kind of hardware do they own? How is the hardware mapped and how does it work together?
 Does the ISP give them access to a server that the ISP owns with the bought IPs connected?(some B2B providers sell like this)
 Or, do they need to have their own servers and they lay the cables from the ISP datacenter to their servers and host the proxies there?
 What software do they use to host? Is it the normal squid for http/https and dante for SOCKS? I&#x27;d assume they write their own software. So,
 What is the prerequisite knowledge to write that software? I suppose its socket programming(correct me if I am wrong).
 Lastly, What is the cost of the hardware for hosting lets say a /20? Both one time and periodic costs.
  
I am sorry if my questions aren&#x27;t specific, but I would be really glad if you all could answer them in detail. Have a good day!

Since neither Cisco nor Palo officially support one another&#x27;s SFPs, does this mean that as long as I use Cisco 10G-SFP-SR in the Cisco switch and I use Palo Alto PAN-SFP-PLUS-SR SFPs in the PA-850 that both devices will be fully supported by their respective TACs? I know, I know, OEM optics aren&#x27;t worth it, bla, bla, bla. Just looking for insight on the TAC support.

                              <span>Hi. 
 I have pretty much no knowledge about networking but trying to fix a problem in work. We have a control unit on our furnaces which was connected to a laptop via Ethernet that displays all data and history on the program we use. The laptops battery has bulged massively so I’ve decided to rearrange the previous workers setup and I installed an ssd in the pc I use in here as well, hoping to run the program and work network all from the same pc. I bought a switch which both the network and furnace control unit are connected to. I’ve successfully managed to connect to the network but i cannot ping the control Unit. After reading a bit about switches I can understand the problem but no idea how to fix it. The unit has its completely separate ip address. I’m assuming when pinging, it’s trying to find the ip on the network. Is there anyway I can fix this and connect to the control unit ? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, this morning a printer connected to this switch suddenly stopped working. After some checks we saw that there&#x27;s no link and so RJ45 led is not blinking properly.
 After this we checked: - another device to the same switch port works fine. - same device on another switch port has the same problem. - same device connected to a normal port ( the traffic port coming to the switch) works fine.
 Since we have other devices, we just replaced it but I would like to know what could be the issue, if anyone knows.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked quite a lot with integrating things into the network at the edge, and by various business functions. It also seems to me that besides very different business functions at the edge, there can be various actors needing to operate at the edge for example either as different company entities under the same umbrella, different companies operating due to subcontracting or other business/organizational reasons.
 Just thought that it might be convenient to &quot;virtualize&quot; switches and assign a set of ports to adhere to different access control schemes or perhaps to completely act as isolated virtual switches, but within the same switch hardware to conserve resources.
 I&#x27;ve never heard of such implementations, but has anyone had similar thoughts or what kind of solutions do you usually go for in cases where shared hardware would be cost-effective but difficult to implement?

 we will upgrade all our network to SDA and will change all switches to be 9K series but we have a large number of FortiAP which managed by Fortigate firewall and its support 802.1X, how can we migrate FortiAPs to our new SDA Network , any suggestion scenario

                              <span>Hi All,I originally posted this on on r/sophos but also wanted to get a more &quot;networking&quot; guidance..
 We are going through an SG to XG (Firewall) migration with a twist of also removing an outside Cisco ASA. Our Sophos SG is our internal gateway to all of our vlans so the Sophos XG will be the same. We would like to put the two in parallel so that we can slowly migrate a few vlans over at a time, but are struggling with the gateway/routes part.
 Without changing all our IP&#x27;s and to keep gateways the same - are we best to create a new vlan exclusive for routing all traffic from the XG to the SG?
 For example we disable vlan 2 on SG 192.168.2.1, we then enable vlan 2 on the XG 192.168.2.1But our domain controllers and remainder of our environment is on the SG. So do we static route interface vlan 2 to the IP of the SG? How will it know how to process vlan 2 traffic if the vlan is turned off?
 Our aim is to pick one on prem application at a time and essentially test it before going live. And with everything live and in parallel we can log into the SG and Cisco ASA to compare rules and figure out where the config is incorrect on the Sophos XG.
 Any help or guidance would be appreciated.
 Thank you!

 Management is opening the checkbook after a major incident with a subsidiary. Long story short, they see the value in EDR now that we had to roll out a trial of CrowdStrike on top of Sophos Intercept X to get the visibility our incident response company needed. It&#x27;s a real opportunity to bring in a great product. Traditionally these incidents are what drive security investments, so I need to take advantage of this and wave the security flag so that they give me that end-of-the-year leftover money. I have no experience with EDR products, but I&#x27;m confident I can learn
 Our Sophos reps have been touting their EDR as amazing, they claim to have made some big advancements compared to previous iterations. I&#x27;m not …</span>

 I have 0 knowledge about the environment and I was just told there is no technician at the moment but that I would be hiring one soon. What do you all recommend I do in regards to getting adjusted to my new role? I was thinking of doing a walkthrough the entire city infrastructure however I would like to know what exactly I should be looking for or make note of. Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Thanks for taking the time to read this post.
 We run Exchange Server 2016 on-prem and will be migrating to Exchange Online (EXO) in the near future. It&#x27;s about 300 users with 4TB-ish of data and some overly critical public folder mailboxes as well. Ideal end state is a hybrid setup, as we do have some legacy servers that need SMTP access. In addition, inbound mail will still go through Mimecast prior to being delivered to EXO.
 Since we are a small team, we engaged with an MSP to provide a quote to do some of the migration. They provided a &quot;get your tenant configured to best practices and migrate data&quot; quote in the six figure range. That seems very high to me based on the scope of work provided. 
 Those of you who have done this migration, is it six-figures difficult? Also is the use of BitTitan (or similar) really necessary or can the built in migration tools do the job just as well? Having not run through the process I&#x27;d like to hear any feedback you may have. 
 Thanks,
 _ns_

                              <span>I am deploying a small system on a really small server room. Room used to be a bathroom and was repurposed as a server room. 
 It has an exhaust fan because it used to be a bathroom with no windows. 
 It’s hot where I am and normal indoor temperature usually ranges between 28-35 degrees Celsius without AC. 
 Client doesn’t want an AC unit because of the electricity cost. What options do I have to cool space? Or will cooling it be needed?

                              <span>TL;DR: If any of y&#x27;all work for ManageEngine, tell the techs to stop fighting for remote control.
 I&#x27;ve had the disproportionately unpleasant experience of working with their techs remotely in probably 20 occasions now. Of those, about half were unproductive, and 4 were straight up infuriating.
 Listen, if your remote access software does not allow me to immediately and consistently take over control from a tech, your remote access software is complete thrash. It&#x27;s beyond thrash, as it would be more apt to call it malware.
 The amount of times I&#x27;ve had a tech veer off and start making unapproved changes to a production server are ridiculous. One guy straight up navigated away from the ME window and started uninstalling unrelated apps before I straight up spammed Ctrl+Alt+Del. Despite obviously fighting for mouse control for a full 10 seconds so I could even type a message to him, he continued trying to do it. 
 It took me essentially swearing at him in caps (once I had control) for him to apologize and start asking permission before he made any further changes.
 This happened on 4 different occasions with 4 different techs. Baffling. I have some text now I paste to preemptively let them know what the expected etiquette is.
 I despise being a dick to techs, but gotdamn.
 Serves me right for not using a jump RDP to facilitate support.

 TL/DR: Atera&#x27;s version of AnyDesk will let anyone access your endpoints. Furthermore, based on Atera ignoring my requests for support and my inability to find any such feature in their console, I have been left to believe that you -cannot- do anything to prevent this.
 OK, this is going to be a wall of text. I&#x27;m sorry.
 I was about 2 weeks into a trial with Atera when I decided to deploy it to all our workstations since the small pilot group (about 15 workstations) had been working well. Splashtop wasn&#x27;t automatically being downloaded by the agents so I submitted a ticke…</span>

                              <span>Just got invited to a workshop where the focus is to increase internal operational efficiency. We’re not a profitable company. 
 I know it’s meant well, but from my end it looks heavily inspired by the Wall Street article ‘It’s Time to Get Rid of the IT Department’. 
 In any case it got me wondering, what’s on your wishlist to increase operational efficiency? Here’s mine: 
 • Additional resources so tier 2/3 can actually focus on strategic tasks and not end user support 
 • More self service (catalog/bot) ++ if we can create micro experiences for users here
 • Stronger processes and training 
 • HRIS and IT directory to be in sync

                              <span>My wife came home from work last night and told me that the new IT guy implemented a ticketing system at the law office she works in.
 She was angry about it. Why should she have to submit a ticket every time there&#x27;s a problem when her desk is right outside the data closet where the IT guy sits??? She&#x27;s &quot;special&quot; so she shouldn&#x27;t have to use that damned ticketing system.
 I tried to calm her, I explained the importance of a ticketing system, and after 30 minutes or so, she finally came around and now I think the IT guy owes me a drink at the next Christmas party....
 It is always good to get the end users perspective from time to time, and more importantly, the ability to explain things in a way that doesn&#x27;t end with me sleeping on the couch!

This instantly reminded me of the &quot;spare&quot; servers or routers in just about every rack that we tell the remote hand to just yank parts out of to fix a problem quickly. 
 What do y&#x27;all call your datacenter equivalent of a hangar queen?

                              <span>Half of the job is absolutely a learned skill, working with software that the average user would have no idea how to work. 
 But I swear, half of the issues I resolve are me being the only one in the room to point out that you can&#x27;t plug a power strip into itself and expect it to work. Today I was assured a piece of equipment was plugged in - the cable was plugged into the device, but not a power source. Why does it feel like so much of my day is dedicated to what should be fixable by anyone who is even remotely paying attention?

                              <span>One of the most common things that I see on here are issues with IT Departments getting notified of personnel changes. New hires, terminations, title changes, department moves, etc. 
 Does your company have a real HRIS? Not some spreadsheet Karen put together, but a publicly purchasable platform? It probably has an API. It could even have web hooks. 
 Take the time, if you have the coding chops or someone in the company does, to set up a connection to that API and monitor employee changes. 
 Billy gets fired and the HRIS gets updated? Automatic email to the IT ticket system. Becky gets hired? Automatic email to the ticket system. Andy changes job titles? IT probably needs to change security groups, distribution groups, and update AD properties. Guess what. Automated email to the ticket system. Jenn stays in the same position but changes supervisors? You guessed it, email to the ticket system. Heather went on FMLA and needs a temporary revocation of access? Believe it or not, automatic email to the ticket system. 
 There are no more late notifications, as long as HR is on the ball. You are eliminating the weak link- humans remembering they need to tell IT. 
 Even if you can&#x27;t do it in house, hire someone. Your ROI is huge. Customer service improves. Visibility improves. Metrics on time to delivery become meaningful. 
 HR doesn&#x27;t have an HRIS? Well, that&#x27;s probably the first thing the company needs.

                              <span>Got into IT so I didn&#x27;t have to talk to people or listen to their whining. No matter what position I&#x27;m in I seemingly can&#x27;t escape this customer service mindset from management and its driving me insane. I don&#x27;t care about their issues. I don&#x27;t care about their whining. That&#x27;s for helpdesk. I&#x27;m here to build infrastructure, improve security, and ensure five nines of uptime. I&#x27;m not putting on any sort of customer service persona. Put in a ticket to helpdesk, do not approach me personally.
 The kicker is that I&#x27;m actually a very nice person for an IT guy - I frequently go out with coworkers, go to almost all the company events, get coffee with users, etc, but the enforcement of customer service has gone so far to extend to my real personality. I hate it, I want to be nice and not view everyone as an annoyance but this mindset makes it impossible.
 Anyways, did I get into the wrong industry? If so, what&#x27;s an industry where you don&#x27;t have to deal with people, or listen to their whining? At this point I&#x27;m totally willing to change career paths so I can get my personality back.

                              <span>This morning I had to look back at a how to type documentation that I made almost 4 years ago. I couldn&#x27;t remember any of the steps on the guide before opening it because I hadn&#x27;t had to use it since it was made. 
 But thank the Lord I made it, because it was a lifesaver. I even had a whole page of troubleshooting steps in case the commands start throwing errors.
 Couldn&#x27;t help but thank my past self and make me really appreciate detailed documentation.

                              <span>Hi All...first time I have seen this. WSUS is not showing the November cumulative updated as needed by any of my machines. When I look at the machines, and check with Microsoft, it shows the update is needed - obviously it is needed. I can see the update in WSUS...I can also see that machines are reporting back to WSUS and in fact, it did show about three other updates for Office as needed. I tried cleaning up WSUS last night...ran a bunch SQL scripts to clean it up, but still, it does not show the November update as needed by any machines. Has anyone seen anything like this? I am about ready to try to reinstall WSUS.

 We have run into a problem lately where 3rd party contractors and vendors not using their own laptops / desktops cannot connect to our RDS Apps. When connecting to the app they get stuck on Configuring Remote Session and it sits cycling forever.
 None of our domain joined company devices are having this issue. Re-imaging a non-domain joined laptop that we use for testing also resolved the issue but obviously telling 3rd party users to wipe their machines isn&#x27;t a viable solution.
 This appears to be a recent issue and the only recent change I can remember making to the environment is updating the certificates about a month ago. I double checked that certificate was applied to all of the Broker roles and in the Gateway manager as well as IIS.

                              <span>Hey fellow sysadmins,
 I am currently working as a Configuration Team lead on a team of four supporting our Windows and Mac endpoints. I&#x27;ve been in this role since about 2018 and I don&#x27;t feel like I am growing skill-wise anymore. The environment is very lax and I tend to have lots of down time, with spurts of busy periods, but overall our team is very much overlooked so we don&#x27;t often get fun things to work on. Our client is a painful at times to work with, and our contract mgmt side is abysmal. There&#x27;s a bit of this unfair treatment of workers where the good performers are punished for doing their jobs well, while the bad performers fly under the radar unharmed. All in all, it&#x27;s a bit toxic and I&#x27;ve been wanting to find greener pastures.
 Fast forward to today, I&#x27;ve been interviewing for …</span>

                              <span>Hi all, very quick question.
 Before I get hung, drawn and quartered by the sub, we will eventually turn them on but we are currently working on the tenant and they are not needed.
 MS in it&#x27;s ineffable wisdom have decided they will force-enable them in 6 days.
 I want to opt out of this without activating them.
 I have searched online and found plenty of &quot;how to disable&quot; but nothing about prevention.
 Anyone here know if there&#x27;s a setting somewhere that amounts to &quot;leave me alone for another week or so&quot;?

 I started sync our domain joined computer to Azure AD. If I checked dsregcmd /status. I can see this:
  
AzureAdJoined : YES
 EnterpriseJoined : NO
 DomainJoined : YES
 DomainName : contoso.com
 Virtual Desktop : NOT SET

SSO State:
  
Server Error Code : invalid_client
 Server Error Description : AADSTS2205015: The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) failed signature validation. Expected Subject Key Identifier XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX does not match CRL Authority Key YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Please request your tenant administrator to check the CRL configuration.
  
Where could be a problem I have configured AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority, which is our CA
  
CrlDistributionPoint : https://contoso.com/ca.crl
 TrustedIssuerSki: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  
Any idea how to fix this?
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been avoiding helping friends and acquaintances with their IT related purchases simply because they always assume that if I&#x27;ve had anything to do with their purchase, I&#x27;m forever responsible for it and obligated to provide endless free support. 
 This is why the only thing I am still willing to recommend is a Chromebook and even that only if they&#x27;re willing to pay Google for extra storage. 
 Surely, I can&#x27;t be the only one. What&#x27;s your way of wiggling out of this unwanted trojan-horse responsibility? How do you deal with friends asking you to help them buy/set-up/upgrade their network, computers, home automation, etc? Where and how do you set boundaries?

                              <span>This is just for future reference, since this has been a lengthy support case @ Microsoft. And there had been only 1 search result online which led nowhere.
 When trying to repair our CTR Office installs we were presented with an error code 30029-9 - supposedly Office has no internet connection stating &quot;Online Repairs need the internet and it looks like you may not be connected.&quot;
 We finally pinned it down to a group policy that&#x27;s Enabled but left blank. This used to work, and now somehow it doesn&#x27;t anymore since. And apparently it&#x27;s &quot;By design&quot;.
 The group policy setting is 
 Target Version
 The field &quot;Update Version&quot; was blank. Which now triggers this error. And even though the Group Policy itself says &quot;If you enable this policy setting, but you leave the version blank, Office is updated to the most current version that’s available at the update location for Office&quot; it&#x27;s no longer working and it&#x27;s _by design_ that it&#x27;s suddenly starting to spill this error.
 If we set the policy to &quot;Not Configured&quot; - everything is working fine.
 So the resolution to this; Not Configured. 🤷‍♂️

                              <span>Question about DMARC, i currently set this dns record to none (which is a passive mode). I now what to set it to quarantine. My understanding is that this only affects inbound messages and put fail dmarc auth into my domain user&#x27;s spam folder. Or does it also affects outgoing email? So for example, if i set the DMARC rule to p&#x3D;quarantine will this ever affects me as a sender that if the recipient does not have DMARC turned on it will put my email into their spam folder too?

 No. this guy wants me to make sure the (new 0 online hour) hardrives &quot;have loose bearings, so the disks can spin freely&quot;
 Apparently if they aren&#x27;t &quot;burnt-in&quot; they will be slow for a few months while the drives&#x27; ware in their barrings 
 ​
 have you ever heard of any such procedure? Any idea where this notion came from?

 ​
 I have an question. Here in the enviroonment we have several servers running with all his own services.
 2 dcs (1st one is AD-DS, GPO, DNS etc. 2d one is replication for AD-DS)
 1 sync server with Azure
 1 WSUS server
 1 backup server (veaam, and cloud backup)
 1 file server
 1 WDS server
 I have installed, and configured on the WSUS server everything. 
 But the updates still goes through Windows Updates instead of the Server.
 Any chance someone can help me out. 
 Powershell command

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping someone can suggest a tool to create some network traffic and activity on hosts for a training environment.
 The plan is for a training environment for my team (SOC/IR) to work through scenario-based engagements with our in-house red team, but we need some &quot;noise&quot; for the red team to blend into. Ideally, something that will generate user activity in the form of opening applications, logging in and out, accessing sites, and email traffic - the things you would see daily on a live network. As it stands, without this, the moment the red team performs any action, it is immediately obvious as they are generating the only traffic.

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m planning to upgrade our physical Server which hosts a good amount of Virtual Servers from Windows 2012 R2 to 2019.
 I plan to use update feature that is given when you start the iso from Windows server 2019.
 Of course I&#x27;m planning a downtime for the virtual servers. Also I want the virtual servers to run as they do now.
 Has anyone done a similar upgrade? Will this upgrade affect the virtual servers in any kind?
 Does anyone have further recommendations?
 Best regards

 Other devices shall not be able to access.
 I don&#x27;t think the passphrase is the best solution: if stolen it could it could be used by anyone.
 WPA2-enterprise AFAIK authenticates the user and not the device.
 Do you have any suggestion?

                              <span>Hi all. I was in desktop support for a larger internal IT department for 3 years before this (total of 7 years including my first job there in helpdesk)
 Didn&#x27;t touch intune/group policy/or another form of remote management previously. I was just on the but end of stick and kicked off images and did deskside support for workstations and hardware support for laptops.
 An opportunity came to me 6 months ago from my old boss who changed companies for a MSP and I became a &quot;Systems Administrator&quot; basically everything to do with remote workstation and application management with a bit of apple mdm in the mix also. Intune/group policy/PDQ/some PowerShell scripting/MDT/SCCM/remote application deployment and updates.
 This was everything I wanted to do in my last role but it went to the sysadmins to do and I had no access.
 When I started there was a senior guy who knew everything and was loads of help to escalate to. He has since resigned since a few weeks ago.
 So now me and the other new guy are on our own. The ticket queue keeps building up and there are dozens of tickets that neither of us have any idea how to fix. SLA&#x27;s are ticking away and customers are expecting updates for ticketd that have been sitting in the same status for weeks
 Yes I&#x27;m getting my googling and actioning stuff, making mistakes and fixing things but everyday is completely miserable. I went from knowing everything at the back in of my hand to bieng a junior again
 Those that went from helpdesk/desktop support to a &quot;sysadmin&quot; position how did you cope/deal with the day to day workloads?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;re currently about to deploy the M365 Apps for Enterprise (Office 365) to our endusers. For patching we use a 3rd Party Patch Management solution (Matrix42 PatchManagement) which manages the new office versions. The clients should therefore not use auto updates via CDN as the patches should all be installed via the 3rd-party solution. 
 To achieve this, we tried to disable the automatic updates using group policy and set the option &quot;Enable Automatic Updates&quot; to &quot;Disabled&quot;. Enable Automatic Updates (admx.help) 
 At first launch when the policy is active the update seems to be disabled but as soon as I login with an Azure AD account in order to get office licensed the option is reset and updates are offered via CDN.
 Did anyone face a similar behavior already and knows if there is an additional option in the M365 tenant configuration which may overrules the GPO setting?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I&#x27;m not very experienced with storage, I read the documentation but i can&#x27;t find the part on how to wipe/clear all data from a old storage? Do I have to do it manually disk by disk?
 IBM says i have to have windows server 2003 or 2008 connected with the storage but i don&#x27;t have any.
 Can anyone help me?
 EDIT: I tried with IBM support and tried to download DS Manager but i got &quot; No applicable IBM support agreement found for one or more of the products you selected. &quot; But I already knew that.

 For those of you in similar cloud only environments - what you do?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m running into a few problems with my Synology, I have the latest dsm installed and have 5 disks configured in a raid 10 with 1 hot spare disk.
 This has been configured as a btrfs volume.
 I want to use the volume via iscsi on my windows Hyper-V server as a backup location.
 I have set up the iscsi target on my server and the drive shows up but as unknown and offline.
 So I&#x27;m struggling with getting the drive setup as a usable volume in windows.
 Does anyone have any tips or tricks i could try? I&#x27;ve been searching on the Synology knowledge base but can&#x27;t find any relevant info.
 Cheers, Henk

                              <span>I took the position because it was my first offer and I need a job badly. The job pays 24/hour. My last position was a salaried IT support specialist, which came out to 25/hour (52k/year - yes, i believe I was overpaid there). This is a contract to hire position, and it was mentioned that if hired the salary would be around 70k, and from brief research in my state that&#x27;s about right. I know I&#x27;m technically an employee of the contracting company, but am I being kinda shafted here? I&#x27;m not too hung up on this as the position looks great on my resume, but I am slightly annoyed by it, especially since I&#x27;m making less than I was in what many would consider a less in-demand position. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you!

I’m well paid, but I just am tired of living in this space where I’m saying the same thing everyday and not really building anything. I don’t know how quickly I’d be able to make the switch to IT administration or IT in general, but would I make as much? Is it worth making the switch? 
 Tl;dr in tech, but want to switch into IT, is it worth it?

                              <span>I have a pair of Cisco ASR1001 routers with 4GB of ram each. My neighboring bgp peer is advertising full bgp routes to me, this killed my routers memory. So I configured a route map to block prefixes in except for default route if it was being distributed. (It wasn’t ☹️ ) I noticed that the route map denied 2,753,559 prefixes which seemed to be an excessive amount. I’m guess this excessive amount of routes is due to their blended circuits with full bgp routes so I’m probably receiving all the prefixes with multiple paths and that’s the reason the prefixes are 2.7M ?
 Also in terms of memory will the ASR1001 non X edition support 16GB of ram (2x8 GB) or is it only 4GB sticks with a maximum of 8GB? All content online seems to only talk about 1001X.

                              <span>Too complex?
 First EVER post on Reddit. I’m a newb network engineer with 3ish years experience. I deal with nexus, firepower, asa, catalyst, and many other brands/versions. I have worked extremely hard the past three years to be where I am and I know a decent amount. The more I turn to certifications and learning current tech, the more I get discouraged and have imposter syndrome. Does anyone else think we are getting way too complex? I mean SD-WAN, APIs on network equipment, vxlan, cloud, multi context firewalls, or multi context per say with nexus. I mean I find the GUI weird and prefer cli. Thanks to firepower and DNA, it’s moving to GUI. Maybe I’m just way too new and dumb at the moment, but I feel like a a lot of this is just craze on hype terms. Also, how do we keep up with all of this? There is no way to know it all. 
 Please let me know you’re thoughts!

                              <span>I have a Cisco FB 2100 6.5.6 that I use an existing URL whitelist (and block everything else). I&#x27;d like to export the list both to proof it and to find out why some items I&#x27;ve whitelisted aren&#x27;t working. The gui doesn&#x27;t give me this so I was thinking CLI/export mode is where I could do it. I found an article once with the precise instructions and literally (a few hours) of research and searching can&#x27;t find the thing again. i.e. so if anyone can point me in the right direction this is really annoying (right now LOL)

                              <span>Hey guys I am looking to do my exam the next months.and I do have a question to the people who did it. I have alot of practical experince (5 years)with Firepower/asa/Secureendpoint/umbrella/DNA/ISE/WSA/Restapi/Python but not ESA. I did study ESA for my CCNP Exam but never deployed one for anyclient sadly. My question is how much practical experince do i need to pass the exam and do the exam ask some question about something you just forgot in the markting presention which has no practical use? To be honest I dont know how to study for this exam . I can deloy any of the products I talked about except ESA with all of its features. is that enough? or do I need more?

 With the example configuration below, if any other prefixes are advertised by BGP will it get rejected because they aren&#x27;t being matched in the route-map? Or will it just be secluded from getting tagged given the specified community attribute in the config?
 ip prefix-list xxx_1 seq 20 permit 4.4.4.0/24

                              <span>Hello AAA gurus, we are using ISE for dot1x and I&#x27;m new to it. We are using EAP chaining for wired only and once machine authenticated it has access to the basic AD, DNS etc and once user is authenticated it gets dynamic access to relavent vlan and dacl based on AD group. Now the problem is normally user are connected on wireless which isn&#x27;t using chaining and only AD username password are used. If user password is expired and they change it while being on wireless they won&#x27;t be able to get access to network and login to the laptop until their laptop is connected back to wired after password reset. 
 Any idea what could be the issue? Please need your help, I&#x27;m banging my head.

                              <span>Sorry if this somehow breaks the rules as its not necessarily about networing, but its relevant to what a lot of us have to deal with when we pick up contractor work.
 I am in a position where I am clearly putting in more work than was discussed on signing of my contract for my pay rate. Without going into too much detail (but I will if you guys ask), the project is extremely understaffed and I am an extremely important asset to the success of this project, as I know the ins and outs of it all. All the new people we hire keep quitting because they cant handle the fire or maybe they realize the pay doesn&#x27;t justify the stress.
 Do you think its possible I can go to my contractor and explain to them that we (the contracting company and I) should push for a higher compensation? I know everyone is replacebale, even if I&#x27;m not exaggerating about my contributions.
 I think the smartest thing to do would be to just start interviewing again, and then use the new offer as leverage if I decided to stay. What do you guys think?

                              <span>I have a non-profit (public school) radio station that I provide the IT and engineering support for. I would like to implement a network monitoring system to provide alerting and statistics for the networks within the station. Note that although this is part of, and physically in, a public school, the radio station network operates independently from the rest of the school - including it&#x27;s own connection to the internet.
 The big issue I have is budgetary (which should not really be a surprise) - I have $0 to spend on this. I am, therefore, looking for something free and open source. I know there are several things out there that exist for this, Nagios is the only one I am familiar with.

 I&#x27;m not here to argue that ubiquiti edgemax is the best, but it did do everything I needed it to do which was:
  
console connection
 SSH/CLI interface
 web GUI (using IP of switch)
 centrally managed IF needed (via UNMS/UISP)
 continue to control via SSH/CLI/direct web GUI even if connected to UNMS/UISP
 PoE
  
The price point was just right, IMO. I could buy one of these switches w/o thinking about it. I typically use the 8 port 150w PoE for my remote IP camera installs. I know cisco and othe…</span>

                              <span>Can you have 2 circuits on the same ASA and have AnyConnect failover between them via the backup server list? I think the only problem would be if AAA is not local or across the internet because those get tied to specific interface (why I don&#x27;t know).
 Assuming the following:
 IP SLA running so the default path will update when each respective circuit is up or down.
 Duplicate NAT statements for each circuits interface (inside &gt; out, out &gt; inside, out &gt; out..etc).

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around this:
 We have a Cisco ASA 5515-X. And we use a static NAT rule with automatic address translation rules to direct HTTPS traffic to a specific web server on one of our LANs. This works fine from the Internet and LANs behind the ASA but does not work from our other /29 static WAN IPs from separate routers.
 From our ISP handoff we connect all of our routers outside interfaces to an 8-port unmanaged switch. We do have an ACL in the ASA to allow HTTPS to this server as it works from the Internet without issue. The issue is any traffic from our other 3 routers/networks using this /29 WAN IP range can&#x27;t access HTTPS on this server. These /29 WAN IPs rightfully do NOT go out to the Internet and know their next hop is another router on this unmanaged switch.
 It looks like traffic is being blocked by a &#x27;rpf-check&#x27; subtype on the HTTPS static NAT rule.
 nat (inside,outside) static interface service tcp https https
 So maybe I&#x27;m using the wrong NAT setup, or some traffic isn&#x27;t being matched so it&#x27;s being blocked by an implicit rule?
 What we are trying to do is to allow users of these other networks to access our websites on this web server. This used to work when we had a different ISP, but they were very different static WAN IPs with the old ISP and not from the same /29 range.
 P.S. I know the ASA 5515-X is end of life and we are working on replacing it.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a bit of a long-shot, but does anyone have learning resources for ICOS?
 I&#x27;ve started to dig into more advanced (still rather simple compared to full-out enterprise but I&#x27;ll get there eventually) networking, and there are a multitude of resources for the major players, as well as a pretty strong community for SONIC. What I cannot find, for the life of me, is more than the introductory &quot;user manual&quot; PDF for ICOS, which doesn&#x27;t actually describe how to do much more than set VLANs and configure the management port.
 I recently came into possession of a whitebox switch with ICOS pre-installed, and I was hoping someone has had experience and/or resources before I just go caveman &quot;play with it till I break it, then wipe and install SONIC&quot; on it (apparently, at least as to the newest information I can find for my particular switch/ASIC, SONIC breaks break-out functionality for the QSFP+ ports, and while not 100% necessary since it&#x27;s just one of several learning platforms, I would like to have that function).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been doing some research to see who really &#x27;powers&#x27; the most popular VPN companies which has involved a ton of reverse IP lookups and traceroutes. One thing I keep running in to though is that some servers will have a hostname of of 123.4.56.789.sea.datapacket.com but their AS comes back as Datacamp Limited. A quick glance at their respective websites sugests they are two entirely different entities. Or in some cases I get multiple ASNs back. Other companies I see this happening with are CDN77,DataCamp Limited, CDNext, and LogicWeb. Really struggling figuring who is who.

                              <span>This is a bizarre situation and I&#x27;m stumped.
 Yesterday, I was suddenly unable to reach a particular website - can&#x27;t ping it. I logged in to a virtual machine within 10miles of me and I can&#x27;t get to the website there either. I checked &quot;Down for Me&quot; and it&#x27;s not down. I checked a third PC, located 300 miles away, and I can get to the website.
 Here&#x27;s where it gets weird. I check another PC in the same local network as the PC that can&#x27;t reach the site, and I can get to the site!
 I ran tracert on the one that can reach it, and it looks like it&#x27;s not going through the same DNSs.
 Can anyone shed some light on what&#x27;s going on? I suspect some DNS gremlins - but it&#x27;s out of my league.
 Should add - I own the website - and it&#x27;s running perfectly.

                              <span>Last week we had an IP conflict with a server and our Cloud Key controller, both are static so no idea what happened. I changed the IP of the server and all is good. But now my CK is constantly dropping offline. Note, that we did have a quick power flicker but our network stack is guarded with a UPS, it&#x27;s also powered with PoE, not the USB. Is my only option to reset and restore?
 Edit: Just realized that the CK Gen 2 has a backup battery internally for scenarios as such. So I&#x27;m not sure why and how it would be corrupted

 Can anyone recommend a &quot;Simple Light Weight&quot; tool for scanning wireless. Really, I just want to see SSID&#x27;s, their signal strength and what channels they&#x27;re using. I had something for Linux in the past which I can no longer remember the name of. But I am looking for something to run on Windows these days.

 All Asterfusion CX-N data center cloud switches &amp; CX-M campus switches preloaded with enterprise AsterNOS, to which now had been updated to support 2 command-line modes: the standard Linux Bash and the traditional commercial switch style (Cisco style /Klish). The #SONiC-based AsterNOS became more operational with traditional network engineers. Engineers only need to log in to the switch and type two lines of code to access the Klish interface and start working quickly.

                              <span>Just can&#x27;t figure this out
 Situation:
 PC1 has 2 network addresses configured (primary 192.168.1.10, secondary 192.168.20.201) and is connected to the Fortigate 30e.
 PC1 tries to communicate with another PC2 through Fortigate with address .20.201 -&gt; .20.8
 Fortigate has only 192.168.1.99/24 lan address and firewall rules for the .1.0/24.
 Client says that connection works, but it is slow ( 50-100kB/s ) if you try to send something from .20.201 -&gt; .20.8.
 Client also said that connection is fast when you remove Fortigate and just connect those PC&#x27;s together. Also with some stupid switch the connection works fine.
 How can this even work because Fortigate don&#x27;t have any .20.0/24 configurations? Do i need to add secondary IP or how should i configure that.
 Spoiler: I&#x27;m new to the networking field and this is my first job related to the networking configurations, so please don&#x27;t kill me, if this is too simple question.

                              <span>I’ve been a little stumped trying to troubleshoot a site of mine. I’m an IT engineer, I like to think I’m not a complete n00b, I’ve successfully been in this field for 10 years I just neglected to learn some of the basics but do well at learning on the go. 
 This site has 1GB single mode dedicated fiber coming in to the MPOE. We are currently, and temporarily, using an office space with existing infrastructure. They got CAT5E running to this MDF, into my Meraki MX100, and then back out over CAT5E into a Meraki 24PoE switch (can’t recall which model at the moment but can confirm ports are 1Gb compatible) and then to 4 Meraki MR42s. We are a commercial construction company, this site hosts our team as well as our subcontractors which are mainly an architectural firm and a mechanical/electrical/plumbing — aka high usage on full days (250gb up and down). The device connections are spread evenly across the WAPs. Channel utilization is also spread well. Users connected to the WAPs max on speed tests at 72mb. On these busy days there could be 30-50 users. I’m trying to understand how there’s so much loss to the user. I haven’t been able to test directly myself, but the ISP Claims their circuit test results at full speeds. Tests from my router max at 750mb. Tests from the switch max close to that. Tests from the WAPs max at 200mb. Again the user even on a light user day gets 72 — but on busy days they experience soooo much latency and I’m just… lost. I cant see where or why. 
 Application usage in the dashboard shows normal activity, UDP or secure web, MS apps, AWS etc (lot of cloud storage, pretty much everything is SaaS). 
 But I do wonder if the CAT5E is an issue. 
 Can anyone provide some guidance on testing further or troubleshooting? Or validate my one and only theory? Thanks in advance and sorry for sounding like a network n00b. I promise I’m not a total beginner.

                              <span>I have a need to block messages from being sent to Microsoft365 &quot;unified&quot; groups. Every team we have has a unified group, and we want to stop people from using e-mail to mail the group. 
  
All Groups have domain: myTLD.onmicrosoft.com
 All Groups have start with &quot;part_&quot;
 All Users are in a dynamic Microsoft 365 group: &quot;Block E-mail&quot; with an e-mail address of blockemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com
  
Because the groups are always being added, I don&#x27;t want to block it at the group level with delivery management options (unless this is the better/only way). I&#x27;m hoping a transport rule will work for this: 
 I created a transport rule &quot;Block Messages to Teams Groups&quot;
 If message
 Includes these words in the recipient&#x27;s address &#x27;part_&#x27; and and recipients&#x27;s address domain portion belongs to any of these domains: &#x27;myTLD.onmicrosoft.com&#x27; and Is received from a member of group &#x27;blockemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com&#x27;
 Do the following
 Set audit severity level to &#x27;Low&#x27; and reject the message and include the explanation &#x27;E-mail to part Teams is not allowed.&#x27; with the status code: &#x27;5.7.1&#x27;
 The above rule isn&#x27;t catching the messages. In message trace. [User1@TLD.com](mailto:User1@TLD.com) (internal message) hits the &quot;[part_restofemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:part_something@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com)&quot; e-mail address (a M365 Group), expands and then sends to all members of the group.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Is there a good OpenSource solution for managing linux servers? I&#x27;ve been working with Foreman and i&#x27;ve had difficulties with plugin installation and general usage. I thought about going to spacewalk but it&#x27;s been discontinued.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been the industry for over ten years. Quickly moved in to infrastructure and worked for an MSP where I deployed firewalls, phone systems, switches and some servers. After that I had a short stint as a manager and got back in to infrastructure.
 I would assume my work at the MSP was/is very similar to what consultants do. At the MSP our sales guys would sell some equipment and I&#x27;d go in, figure out what they have, how to make it better (or more secure) and deploy the equipment. I assume consultants focus on the middle part, figuring out what you have and make suggestions for improvement. 
 I am by no means an expert but a &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; type. Really, I know how to google stuff. I don&#x27;t have certs. I learn enough about a system to get it to work how I need it to and then move on.
 I believe this would be mostly network related consulting. I don&#x27;t have many details yet. 
 Anyways, I told him I was interested but not sure what to expect or even know what I should be paid or if there&#x27;s anything I should do to protect myself. 
 Any advice would be much appreciated!

                              <span>My company is getting record requests for court cases where if employees conduct work business on their personal phones they have to submit those texts for the court case. I’m looking for a one time software buy (hate monthly/yearly or per device costs) that works both with iPhone and android that I can use to extract texts that can hold up in court. Employees would willingly bring their phones and give consent to pull the texts so the phones would be unlocked. Can anyone suggest a software they use that works and give clear and concise format of texts ?
 🙏🏽thanks
 Edit: my company is local city government. Should’ve been more clear my bad.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I work in IT for a company and sort of new to microsoft admin center. We currently have the process of converting ex employe emial account to a shared mailbox after 90days and after another 90 days if the sharedmailbox is not needed to delete it. For the first time today I went ahead to delete a user sharedmailbox but it seems that the user was also deleted when I did that? I have gone and restored the user but is there anyway to delete or remove the shared mailbox without deleting the user? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Current setup. 2 hosts and 1 nimble. 
 Each virtual machine on the two hosts have 1-2 virtual disks .
 Some of the non-os disks are inside-vm-iscsi connections to the nimble.
 each virtual disk has its own data store on the ESXi that is pointed to its own nimble volume
 the nimble has 28 volumes, one for each virtual disk/ iscsi-connection.
 Would it be sane to create 1 nimble volume on the nimble and 1 datastore per ESXi server, point both new ESXi servers to their own datastore, and create all VM disks inside ESXi in their own datastore?

                              <span>Our org has it so that anything over 1 year old gets moved to an online archive, so a ton of these folders are empty. Our Exchange admin ran a powershell script and said she has ~19,500 folders, I ran a Vbs macro (I don’t have access to Exchange powershell) and it said she had 29,000 folders.
 Do I have to sift through 20,000 sub folders within nested sub folders to clean this up? I’m not knowledgeable about Exchange PS at all but I’d assume the exchange admin would have offered some solution if there was one.
 This all came about when trying to replace her computer, some of her sub folders weren’t appearing. The exchange admins were suggesting basic things like restarting or reloading her profile- I found a Microsoft article saying cached versions of outlook run into issues when a user has 500 folders so I asked the exchange admins if they could tell on their how many she had (before I found the macro) and lo and behold they said that was likely the issue

Cron job on server x, copy script op server y, power Shell scripts etc. We have been trying to use git to safeguard these scripts in a repository but it is just not convenient for these one-off scripts. How do you do this?

 I have got a spam, but what is strange is that the mail address is coming from &#x27;microsoft.com&#x27; domain. Everything seems legit, but if I click on that button, then the address seems to be a typical spam/scam address. Of course, I didn&#x27;t reply, but I seriously wonder, how do they manage to make it appear as if it is coming from a Microsoft&#x27;s domain?

                              <span>I did not sign up for this... at first it was just simple reports like... ah printer report, i mean i look after it so yeah i can see how i have to do a report on it and then Car/Ambulance tracking.. wasnt really hard and also couldnt deny it so i did it..
 now im being asked to create reports about patients on their fucking bowel movements and food intakes and much more bull shit.. what the fuck?
 am i in the wrong here for saying they need a fucking dedicated data analyst or someshit for this and not a fucking sysadmin?
 ​
 Update: i send out a mail saying i dont know anything about data analyzing all that crap to my sr. and in line manager.. CANT WAIT FOR A DUM ASS REPLY.. &quot;maybe you should learn it before thursday on LinkedIn or some other site... we dont have anyone else to do this&quot; fuck you
 Update 2: Guess what? i am to do this bullshit report, and the retard manager came up to my desk and started to walk me throught the site where they log patient stuff and said looks straight forward you should be able to do this, u can use the help section if u want..
 what a retard.. i told him i dont know this.. im gonna do this so poorly im getting fired on next submit.. fuck it

                              <span>I have just taken over an environment with 150k users. I have helpd them postpone the modern authentication enforcement till 31st Dec since the work to transition the users was started late. Have managed to move most of the users to modern auth but around 4000 users still using basic auth despite multiple emails to them asking them to switch.
 What are my options? I&#x27;m considering turning off basic auth for them in batches and just breaking their email in order to force them to switch. Anyone in the same situation?

 Normally when a network account logs in to the PC, a local account is created and if they&#x27;re not on the network they can just login locally then connect to VPN and be on the network.
 I can see the network accounts in C://Users/ but not in local users and groups. What gives?

                              <span>Just in case someone else gets this problem (i would assume so), i just updated my Task Sequences in SCCM with Windows 10 22H2, and the A10 driver package for Dell Latitude 7420.
 Installing this while storage is set to RAID in BIOS generates a BSOD with Inaccessible_Boot_Device message. AHCI works fine (But with 7420 i have often seen AHCI been reset to RAID for unknown reasons and this has generated many support cases, so i prefer to use the default RAID option).
 ​
 Solution: I rolled back to the previous driver package we used (A08). A09 is not tested, but if you have used A09 and it worked, it should be safe rolling back to that.
 ​
 Hopefully this will reduce time spent om troubleshooting for some of you :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m using an exchange rule to catch emails impersonating upper management, HR, and finance employees. It&#x27;s worked well in the past but two days in a row I&#x27;ve received alerts for caught emails but the intended recipient still got the email. Does the forward for approval rule no longer hold the email?
 The rule is:
 IF:
  
sender is outside the org
 the message header includes one of a list of name variations (john smith, j smith, j. smith, john p. smith, etc.)
  
Then:
  
Forward the message for approval to IT shared mailbox
 append a disclaimer
  
Except if:
  
From a list of personal email accounts of upper management

 I need to configure all of our endpoints to automatically connect to networks on the Public profile (not Private/Home) and am unsure of the best way to go about it. Is there an easy way to block through Intune or another method that I can deploy to the endpoints?
 One issue I find is that many devices have already connected to these networks and it would be nice to configure them differently instead of dealing with 100 blocks and network issue tickets the moment that would be enabled. One solution I thought of was to deploy a script that flipped all the networks to Public through the DWORD in the registry under all previously connected networks.
 This feels like a dumb question, so anything is helpful but let me know if I am being dumb and there is a better way to handle this (such as configuring the way private networks are handled)...

 Needing to do a refresher presentation on &#x27;cyber security&#x27; for the whole org.
 I&#x27;ve got previous years presentations, but lets face it, standing there with last year&#x27;s slide deck and reading them out.... well, it&#x27;s not exactly inspiring is it?
 Anyone got any good suggestions for material to use or reference? 
 I&#x27;ve got to cover &#x27;everyone&#x27; so needs to cover the basics of e.g. phishing etc.

                              <span>In short, have 10 new hires starting in a week&#x27;s time. Our supplier has only just let me know there will be a three week delay in receiving the laptops for them. HR is putting on the pressure, as they said they&#x27;ll have to pay them from their promised start date, even if they can&#x27;t technically work yet. Has anyone experienced this problem and know some work arounds?
 Edit: for more context, I&#x27;m at a startup that&#x27;s scaling quite quickly, so this has been an ongoing issue. Especially because we&#x27;re based in the Netherlands and these new employees are mostly working remote. So I need to first get them delivered to the office, then set them up (MDM, etc), then dispatch to the employees wherever they are. We have a relationship with just one supplier, so always encouraged to go through them. However, seems like this won&#x27;t be scalable. Good idea to have buffer stock so will use this thread for the next conversation. Also looking into more scalable solutions/platforms that streamline this whole thing. 
 Thank you for all the advice. Pray for me!

 ​
 Im trying to add a log-prefix to a message before its send to a syslog server. But something not working the way i thought it would.
 ​
 I read from a log file:
 source s_esxihostd {
 file(&quot;/data/logs/hostd.log&quot; follow-freq(1) program_override(&quot;esxi070: &quot;) flags(no-parse));
 };
 ​
 Destination to send:
 destination d_network {
 syslog(&quot;x.x.x.x&quot; transport(&quot;tcp&quot;) port(514));
 };
 ​
 Logfile is being sent:
 log {
 source(s_esxihostd);destination(d_network);
 };
 ​
 The message is sent to the syslog server - but the &quot;prefix&quot; (esxi070) arent printed before the logmessage. I would have expected on the syslog server: &quot;esxi070: &quot;
 Am i doing it wrong? Or is there another way to add a prefix in syslog-ng, for what i can tell it should be the program-override() because the log-prefix() it deprecated?

 The server is still on-premise and is connected in to Azure using Arc

                              <span>This one has us perplexed. 
 Customer had a SBS 2011 server running QB DB manager for their enterprise QB. We upgraded to server 2019 standard, installed QB DB Manager as we would normally. Soon as we did almost every day they tell us they can&#x27;t switch to Multi-user mode. We can&#x27;t find anything wrong, no errors reported by DB Manager, service is always running. We simply login, tell it to scan, accept the warning and it starts working. Maybe for a day, maybe for a few hours, maybe for a week. 
 They can all get to the files just fine from the file share. When they choose multi user mode it doesn&#x27;t work until we click the scan button again. We have several servers with DB manager installed but this one is the only one giving us a problem. Quickbooks support has no clue what&#x27;s wrong. 
 The only oddity that occurred, while we were running the both the SBS 2011 and the 2019 standard some users had issues getting to file shares, as in the connection just seemed very slow. All local lan GB switched. As soon as we cut over the 2019 to be DC and GC with all roles, that issue disappeared. The only issue they still have is resetting the DB manager constantly to allow multi user mode.

                              <span>As a bit of a background: On September 14th, bleepingcomputer.com published an article of a security vulnerability in the desktop client of MS Teams. They recommended, that users should switch to the browser version of MS Teams, until a patch is available. I made all my users use the browser client after reading this article.
 Now I accidently found an article by Tony Redmond, in which he argues, that the vulnerability is not easily exploitable in the real world. He recommends not to switch to the browser version, and still use the desktop version of MS Teams.
 Microsoft itself doesn&#x27;t think, that the vulnerability is critical, and has no priority of fixing the bug.
 So, did I overreact, when I advised my users to use the browser client? (They are nagging each week, that they would rather use the desktop client.)
 And how do you decide in general, if a security vulnerability is worth the effort?
 Edit: Made the argument clearer

 ​
 I am currently testing out a configuration with OCSInventory and GLPI server, it&#x27;s all on the same machine and since i&#x27;ve started with the installation of OCSInventory i was wondering if it was good or bad to use the same mysql database for both.
 ​
 It&#x27;s my ocsweb database and it works if i GLPI uses it as its database too but is it a good practice ? If not why ?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to figure out a way of how I can deploy an application, based on the hardware connected.
 So my initial thought was to do this in PowerShell combined with Intune. But the Intune part seems a little bit too limited for my liking. Or I am not bright enough to solve this puzzle.
 So in terms to understand this behavior, it is when a user connects an USB device with a specific ID, it will install the software/driver for the device.
 I have found the device ID of the device, and setup a detection for it, tested it with multiple different devices and it is the same for this device on every single PC that I have tested with.
 Then I will try and check if the software is already installed on the client PC, and if it is, then do nothing. If it is not, then proceed to install the so…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that a random group of users have reverted back to their old UPN (xx@domain.local) instead of the new (first.last@domain.com)
 I&#x27;ve tried manually setting the UPN correctly (on all users) through AD itself, and another time using powershell (set-adduser -identity $user -userprinciplename $upn) After manually editing, the value is correct and I force a sync. it syncs as normal and it updates in Azure, after a few minutes anything from 2 mins - 60 mins it will revert back.
 Any idea as to why the UPN is reverting in value, and how can I resolve this?
 Auditing is on
 this is from when it reverts back

                              <span>The win 11 laptops after upgrading to 22H2 still cannot connect to enterprise wifi based on PEAP. I have reviewed all posts regarding this issue and have tried disabling device guard, also tried with forcing TLS 1.2, but none of this helped. Which is suprising me, since I have seen a lot of comments claiming that helped. What I also have tried is updating the Intel driver for wifi card to the newest version. 
 What else I can try? Does it make sense to set &#x27;Disabled&quot; on Turn On Virtualization based Security, if it was set to Not Configured by defaults? This question is extra one, for curiosity only, since I tried to change to Disabled and still cannot connect. All windows 10 are able to connect at the same time.

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 So, here&#x27;s the situation - I updated my zabbix-server from 5.4.3 to 6.0.10, did it following the instructions on these pages:
 https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/upgrade/sources
 https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/install#installing-zabbix-daemons
 Then I start the server by doing
 systemctl start zabbix-server
 Everything seems to be OK at this point, and systemctl status zabbix-server returns this: Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/zabbix-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Mon 2022-11-07 17:03:57 MSK; 18h ago Process: 121913 ExecStop&#x3D;/bin/kill -SIGTERM $MAINPID (code&#x3D;exited, status&#x3D;0/SUCCESS) Process: 121915 ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/local/sbin/zabbix_server -c $CONFFILE (code&#x3D;exited, status&#x3D;0/SUCCESS) Main PID: 121917 (zabbix_server) Tasks: 1 (limit: 48660) Memory: 1.8M CGroup: /system.slice/zabbix-server.service └─121917 /usr/local/sbin/zabbix_server -c /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf 
 However, when I open the address in the browser, I get a 503 error. Zabbix server log shows only this:
 121917:20221107:170356.937 Starting Zabbix Server.

 I have no idea what could cause this problem. Could you please help me with this, or at least come up with some possible causes...
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a request for iPads to be used with a process we have to replace paper print outs in the name of being more &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; and &quot;cost saving&quot;. 
 I&#x27;d like to put some numbers to this to see if it&#x27;s actually beneficial. I&#x27;ve done a quick bit of math and found that we would have to print out 130,000 pages to cost roughly the same as the iPad (about 4 years worth of this job). 
 Is there a way to factor in the environmental cost of the iPad? I&#x27;m guessing that all the silicon, glass, gold, zinc etc. are harder to recycle than standard paper, but it would be nice to have a way of quantifying this. 
 Is there any way I can work this out more scientifically than guesswork?

 I would like to find out that a specific group policy setting (just for example Computer configuration / Preferences / Windwos settings / Files / File) is applied in which GPO.
 Is there a way to do it?

 I&#x27;m an aspiring sysadmin and still need a lot to learn. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m making this thread. To collect knowledge from people that are smarter than me.
 Surely some of you have gotten to a point, at which you struggled to solve a certain problem. I noticed, that I often find myself in such scenarios, with no idea on how to address the issue.
 Are there a single or more processes a sysadmin can go through, to solve problems? I am willing and eager to learn, but I cant seem to find the thing I&#x27;m looking for. I know that there is no single way to solve all problems, but surely there has to be some kind of approach, to determine what the issue is, right? 
 I&#x27;ll define what I would call a &quot;process&quot; using a problem, I&#x27;ve got to solve at the moment. 
 I&#x27;ve got VoIP PBX that works like it should, with one exception: the FAX service.
 Since the PBX doesnt send faxes like the old way, it receives an incoming fax , converts the content into a mail and sends the mail to the recipient. This stopped working a few days ago. 
 After a little search, I noticed that the mail server doesnt work anymore. The testmail results in an error message. So I changed it to a Google SMTP to check if the function still works, which it does. The testmail is send successfully, but someone never arrives. 
 Is there a way to check why my testmail does not arrive, and if yes, how?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Hi all, looking for some gear suggestions for a proposed setup at my work because there’re too many options on the market for my small brain to handle. 
 Relatively remote mine site with no fixed connection available, have now got a Starlink online serving as the main connection with a 4G modem as a failover, the rest is basically a mess I’m looking to overhaul. 
 Things I know I need and their requirements below - switch - currently eyeballing a smart/managed device, needs to handle VLANing and possibly some PoE. Probably 10 medium usage devices so throughput likely not a factor, but open to suggestions of standalone routers etc - access points - all devices are currently running on wifi which works well enough for now, so looking for access points that can handle VLAN/multi-SSID (at least 4?), one of which will be located outside 
 Also open to any other suggestions for things to be added. Looking at adding local servers with VPN access and dedicated firewalls and all that jazz once I get a tech consultant out, but just trying to set up segregated/isolated network traffic for different businesses on site/QoS/stuff I understand now. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am out of my depth here, when I send any TCP or UDP packets on any ports, if the destination port is the same as the source port the packet is dropped (or blocked). They don&#x27;t make it to the gateway which leaves either the internal networking or the switch (there&#x27;s only a switch and a firewall on this VLAN).
 Is this something normal that I don&#x27;t know about?
 Any ideas of where in the linux networking stack this might occur?

 Update: manufacturer apparently claims that only unshielded twisted pair will work, though not clear why. Trying to get an answer, but any idea why it would work by design on unshielded, and not shielded?

We have had a SonicWall firewall for a few years and have been impressed by it so I unfortunately assumed the quality level of their switches would be the same. That was a horrible assumption and I&#x27;m looking to replace all 8 SonicWall switches now. But part of the reason we went with SonicWall instead of Dell or Cisco was because of availability issues. Does anyone know of a brand that has switches available for immediate or within a few weeks shipping that they could genuinely recommend. 
 I need;
 4, 24 port gigabit switches 
 2, 48 port gigabit switches
 2 48 port gigabit POE+ switches
 All with 2, 10 gig uplink ports or SFP+&#x27;s

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got 2 24 port cisco 9200 switches that will eventually be stacked together. We haven&#x27;t received the stacking module yet and I&#x27;m working on getting the configuration ready.
 I&#x27;ve only physically connected to one of the switches so far but I&#x27;ve provisioned the second one in the cli of switch 1 and configured both sets of ports. I&#x27;ve also set the first switch to priority 15 to ensure it remains switch1 when I connect them.
 My question is, if I connect the stack now, with the second switch containing a factory default config (same firmware), will the provisioned switch 2 port configs get applied to the actual switch 2? Are there any other steps I need to take to ensure that happens?

                              <span>I recently took over managing DNS and our cloud based WAF for my company. We have a websites hosted on a combination of several subdomains and root domains (e.g. my.company.com &amp; company.com). Currently I&#x27;m trying to see if it&#x27;s possible to route 100% of our traffic through our cloud based WAF before it reaches our firewall. 
 At one point I tried doing a permanent 301 forwarding of the root domain company.com to www.company.com, and then C-naming www.company.com to the edgekey which points to the site. This worked for HTTPS, but broke HTTP redirection causing the site to fail if you didn&#x27;t specify HTTPS. 
 Next, I thought AWS might work if we moved our domains there because they allow ALIAS records for root/apex domains, but after closer inspection it seems limited to only pointing to something else hosted at AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html
 After a bit of a learning process, it&#x27;s looking like the only real option to route ALL traffic through our WAF is to pay them to host our subdomains/root domains for us. This isn&#x27;t cheap. Since I&#x27;ve only been dealing with public DNS &amp; WAFs for a few months , I thought I&#x27;d ask and see if anyone knew of an alternative?

                              <span>Evening All, I manage a small environment within a DC. It’s currently setup as follows. 2 x Netgate 7100 Firewalls setup in HA 2 x Cisco Nexus N5Ks All Hypervisors are connected to both Cisco Nexus N5K’s dual homed via LACP using VPC. So I have achieved full redundancy which is good.
 Currently I don’t perform any routing on the Cisco N5K, I terminate every VLAN on the Netgate Firewall’s and trunk the VLANS back to the Firewalls. Currently around ~60 VLANS. As these are mostly separate customer networks, they often need to remain totally isolated, so this works well. However, some networks have the requirement to route between each other, and some of these routes between VLANS consume a lot of bandwidth. For example Backups. Veeam running in an isolated VLAN but with outbound routing only …</span>

                              <span>I am trying to get Ruckus Access points running through an IPSEC tunnel created between two Palo Alto Firewalls. 
 Office location 1 has DHCP and DNS
 Office location 2 has none of the office one items mentioned above
 Currently the devices in Office 2 can get through to the regular internet and can access resources from Office 1 via the IPSEC tunnel. 
 Also our VoIP (Mitel) phones are not getting Voicemails or Directory services (calls work internally and externally).
 Office 2 has a VoIP switch (ShoreTel/Mitel).
 Wondering if the IPSEC tunnel is missing some configuration? Or there could be some configuration I am missing on the Layer 3 switch?
 The new Office 2 location also has Aruba switches in place. Will add more details if there are more questions.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I have recently deployed a branch of my company with 100% of meraki switch (ms120/410)) with all the network protection &quot;on&quot; :
 - Stormcontrol (broadcast/unknown unicast/multicast) 80%
 - RSTP (core 4096 / others 8192 )
 - IGMP snooping / Flood unknown multicast traffic &quot;enable&quot;
 Everythings works fine except for the deployment of Windows client with SCCM Server (F12) on all my VLAN. Some client are in the same VLAN than the SCCM server DP, some not so my Paloalto&#x27;FW (connected to the core) is making ip helper relay for all VLANs.
 DHCP server are on a datacenter, outside the lan, so i put the mac address of the FW has the only DHCP server allowed on my Meraki network profil. DHCP standard request works fine like that.
 Another branch is full meraki too but with no protection and F12 works fine so i suppose that is somethings on my meraki configuration...
 Any ideas ?

                              <span>We just received 2 new FatPipe Warp appliances to replace our old units, and we are having a strange issue when trying to enable failover. Individually, each of the units works properly. However when all LAN/WAN links are enabled on both appliances, they appear to both try to go active which causes a big headache. 
 Each unit can communicate via heartbeat, until failover is attempted, and then they stop being able to hear each other’s heartbeat packets until they are rebooted. Unit failover is confirmed to be configured properly by Fatpipe support (it’s the identical config that was working on our old units).
 FatPipes documentation is.. mediocre, and their support has been unable to resolve the issue. Just wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar with their Warp appliances? Grasping at straws here.

                              <span>Hi There,
 I am looking to add a second Nexus 5k to my environment with a vPC configuration with the existing 5k. Currently, my UCS environment has both FI A and FI B plugged into the single Nexus 5k.
 Are there any specific changes I need to be considerate of in UCS when plugging FI-B into the second 5k?
 Right now, the config on the single 5k is:
 interface Ethernet1/10 description link to FI A switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 69 interface Ethernet1/11 description link to FI B switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 69 
 I am not sure yet why the second ports from each FI were never configured. Maybe licensing?
 I raised a request with Cisco support, and they pointed me to a document regarding disjointed networks, which I&#x27;m not sure applies to this scenario.
 Please let me know if I can provide additional detail.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey Guys, I’m stuck scratching my head on this one but I figured someone might have a good idea here.
 Recently I discovered some odd access switch behavior, the following config and results occurs; Layer 2 switch downstream from layer3 is adding routes to the routing table that are not accurate and are causing asymmetric traffic.
 Layer 2 switch, cisco catalyst, is configured with only a default gateway of the core, ip routing is not enabled and no static routes defined.
 When we pull up routes on the layer 2, there are specific hosts getting routed to the next hop after the core switch, often times this route is pointing to the default route that is configured on the core.
 I have never seen an access switch add host entires into a routing table before, I thought this could have been an issue with CEF but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
 We also thought it might have been a route redistribution issue, but we’ve now ruled that out as testing from a different remote subnet only experiences a few access switches following this behavior.
 I’ve been toying with the idea that this might be proxy arp, but the fact that it’s not every device has me on the fence.
 Any advice or suggestions are most welcome.

                              <span>So once again I found myself outside my comfort level troubleshooting Cisco switches that seemed to have frozen, and was trying to see if it is a fiber issue, SFP issue or a switch issue. Luckily it was just a switch that needed power cycling, but if it was an SFP issue I don’t have a way to test them and I have no need to be carrying SFP with me for spares since this is the first time I came across an issue recently. Is there a usb to SFP adapter that I can throw any SFP into? Bonus if they support 10g fiber. 
 Thank you in advance

                              <span>Hello fellow network geeks!
 We are setting up a new property with all the structured cabling being CAT6A
 I have a couple of questions
  
We will have 10G capable switches. We will also have cable runs that will be as long as 80m.If the patch cord in the cabinet (patch panel  switch) is a 3m cat6 cable, will we be able to get 10G across the cable run?
 Some switches will have PoE+ devices. Our cable vendor suggested that we if we use 30AWG CAT6A cable for the patching (patch panel  switch), we will only be able to bundle together 12 cables because of the heat dissipation. Have you ever run across this issue?
  
I would love to hear your thoughts
 ​
 Edit: 
 I found the question to answer 2 in this link

What I need is to allow viewing permissions for dcim objects that have a certain tenant and don&#x27;t have a certain tag assigned to them. It would be easy to return objects that have a certain tenant and tag, but I specifically need to exclude everything with that tag.
 These objects also sometimes have multiple tags assigned to them and sometimes they have none.
 Could anyone help me, please? :( Thanks
 edit: Seems like it&#x27;s currently impossible.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Yesterday, I had a problem with firmware upgrade with C9300 and thanks to you, it is solved.
 Now, I have a another problem.
 I configured two 9200 switch as stack switch. After speaking with my colleague, we said that is better that we unstack the switches instead. The problem is that I now can not access the switches after configuring TACACS. I only configured tacacs (they are not installed in the network yet) but I did not configure line con 0 (which Im using for accessing the switches). It just ask me about a username for whatever reason and I can not grasp why.
 Anyway, I would like to factory-reset both the switches from rommon mode. The problem is that, I do not find the correct command to do it.
 Here is all the command in rommon mode for C9200:
 switch: ?
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 arp Dump or Clear ARP Table
 boot Load and boot an executable image
 cat Display text content from a file
 copy Copy a file
 dir List filesystems or a directory on a filesystem path
 help List command information
 history Show command history
 idprom Show idprom data
 ping Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 ping6 Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 reset Reset entire system
 set Set an environment variable value
 unset Unsets an environment variable
 version Show sboot version and runtime info
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 ​
 I used the &quot;reset&quot; command but there is no difference. Not sure what the reset command really do but it does not do a factory-reset which I want.
 Would appreciate any help or any guide you know of.

                              <span>I have a two customers experiencing the same issue and everything has led me to think it’s their network - probably because the way they’re putting together two ISP connections.
 I don’t know how it’s bonded though. It could be through a failover or load balanced. I don’t know. Anyhow, when I set SMTP settings into a MFP, only one email service provider works.
 Not Yahoo, not Gmail, not even the ISPs own email servers establish a connection. They all get timed out. There’s one email service provider that does work but the customers aren’t allowed to use that one because they aren’t paying for it.
 I increased the connection time. Tried multiple DNS. I’ve gone through the whole app passwords thing. I’ve gone through each port. I’ve tested through telnet with success. I also logged in each web portal site and can indeed send emails. I can even connect the MFP to a mobile network and send emails with any of those SMTP settings with no problem. Just not through their network except for that one email service provider. 
 Everything that makes sending emails through an MFP work should work, but doesn’t and it’s only happened with these two customers with their bonded network connections. What I think is happening is that the 250 OK isn’t coming back, so the MFP just gives up. 
 What can I ask them to look for when I visit them again? Should I ask to plug in and tracert, telnet, etc. from within? I get scared plugging into another’s network.
 I can’t ask if the prefix or suffix is being blocked, nor can I ask if the port is being blocked because that one email service provider works. It’s just all other ones don’t. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
 Sorry for the inconvenience.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Hope you all are doing well and safe.
 I have been assigned to replace the old cisco 3750 and 2960 switches with cisco 9200L series. 
 I have restored the cisco switches which are on the same model, but in this case the models are different. So, I am assuming that this might not be possible as there are differences in hardware and possbily OS version as well.
 What&#x27;s the best way for the above situation? The old switches are still in production.
 Many thanks :)

                              <span>My organization uses Knowbe4, and it&#x27;s been a fantastic tool for simulating email phishes for our employees.
 I&#x27;m a little worried my elderly grandmother (who is around 80) and her ability to recognize a phish, so I was hoping to find a tool that I can use. My plan is to walk her through how the simulations will work and what she&#x27;ll need to do, so I&#x27;m hoping for a tool that has a phish reporting mechanism (maybe forwarding an email to specific email address?) and is of low cost (or preferably free!)
 Does anyone know of any such offerings? Or maybe a bigger security company like Knowbe4 has a personal/family plan?

 what can I do?? I&#x27;ve reached out to our MSP. Safe mode.. everything goes back to the screen above!
 EDIT; with guidance from our MSP we ran a Veeam restore of the DC. Veeam puts the restored DC in non-authoritative mode, after it grabs the latest AD info it switches out of that mode (I think!). Everything seems to be working fine. user logins/computer logins, dns, replication, all good. it&#x27;s a 2012r2 that&#x27;s going to be retired soon (with the rest of the 2012r2&#x27;s in the world).

                              <span>I&#x27;m having issues with devices updating to 21h2. Since 21h1 is reaching EoL in December, I need to make sure that these are getting updated.
 WSUS was passed over for Intune, but Intune wasn&#x27;t deployed when it was supposed to be. Therefore, as a stopgap, I&#x27;m being asked to use GPO to force feature updates.
 Many of our devices are stuck at 21h1 which was the version built into the image. Devices refuse to update to 21h2. The update doesn&#x27;t even show when checking for updates. However, downloading and running the installer tool allows it to install without issue.
 Has anyone seen this before? I ran the troubleshooter and it can&#x27;t figure it out either.
 I wrote the GPO to force-check updates and update to at least 21h2 with business hours excluded and different settings for mandatory restarts etc.
 If this fails, aside from going machine to machine, I&#x27;m at a loss...

 Premise: Trying to load a website and run a query. Works fine...until I add a computer to the domain.
 All computers on the domain have a problem with this website. I KNOW WHAT YOURE THINKING, but I disabled ALL GPOs and fresh loaded windows/joined domain after, even then, website breaks.
 No 3rd party Antivirus of any kind. 
 One of the more odd things is that the website works for about 5 minutes after being added to domain. After that Kaput.
 I am truly baffled. 12+ years IT and 30+ hours on this issue alone. Please, help T.T
 Edit. About to crash, I&#x27;ll try all the new suggestions tomorrow and let everyone know how it goes.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I am reviewing the power loss prevention strategy at a client site due to a severe power outage we had over the weekend that caused issues and the UPS did not pick up the slack quickly enough. I am reviewing the UPS situation so this question is solely looking at the R220 server.
 The server we have is an R220 with the H310 raid controller and Write Through enabled.
 Since Write Through is enabled there should be minimal loss (if any) during a power outage. Is there any advantage (other than performance) for upgrading the H310 to an H710P with a battery? Or does the advantage only come into play when Write Back is turned on?
 TLDR: If I have write through turned on with an H310, does upgrading to an H710P with a battery (with write through remaining on, NOT write back), do we gain any additional power loss protection?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I&#x27;m a bit stuck on this one and any assistance would be amazing. I&#x27;m very much an Nginx noob.
 We have an existing Nginx setup with lots of redirections already configured.
 I&#x27;m trying to only redirect one subdomain in Nginx to an external url, however no matter what I try it redirects all subdomains. 
 I&#x27;ve reviewed our existing configs to get some understanding of how things are setup but the life of me I just can&#x27;t work this one out and all the search results I seem to find are for redirecting all subdomains or sub sites not for redirecting just one subdomain of many.
 This subdomain didn&#x27;t have an existing config and I&#x27;ve had to create one (copy one of our others and edit it) it looks like previously the subdomain was configured under a catch all.
 Example:
 I need https://foo-bar.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 However I don&#x27;t want https://other-site.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 This is the current config
 ******************************************************************
 server {
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^ https://externalURL.com;
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 }
 ​
 server {
 listen 443 ssl http2;
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://externalURL;
 ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/foo-bar.crt;
 ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/foo-bar.key;
 ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
 ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
 ssl_session_timeout 30m;
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 ​
 location / {
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 index index.html foo-bar.html;
 autoindex on;
 }
 ​
 }

 Audit logs in Purview, MCAS and content search don’t seem to provide this information. Also nothing in Advanced Threat Hunting data.

                              <span>We have a system where the keyboard starts having caps lock &quot;stick&quot; on, making it quite difficult to enter your password or complete other tasks where case matters.
 We have replaced the keyboard, mouse, and then the entire computer. The new PC was a clean image on a brand new computer taken out of the box for this. 
 The shift lock affects local physical users and remote control users over ConnectWiseControl. 
 At this point, I figure it has to be either some device plugged in that is screwing with the keyboard (this controls special hardware), or a bug in some piece of software needed on this computer. 
 We do not see this with otherwise identical computers and configurations around the org.
 We&#x27;re going to try disconnecting all USB devices except for mouse and keyboard and see if it goes away, and do the old add them back one by one. But I had the idea that if there was something like Wireshark for USB, especially keyboard commands, it might narrow this down vs just blindly plugging things in.

                              <span>I just had the scariest 30 minutes.
 I&#x27;m at the office and decide to check my gmail and see that my NAS at home has been disconnected from the internet since midday. I figure our home internet has dropped out or there&#x27;s been a power cut so decide to try and connect to the NAS over the internet anyway.
 Oh. It&#x27;s up. That&#x27;s weird. Why is it saying it&#x27;s disconnected from the Internet then? Ah well, let&#x27;s login and see what&#x27;s going on. Enter credentials, enter the MFA code and &quot;The verification code is incorrect&quot;
 Um. WTF? Try a couple more times and MFA simply isn&#x27;t working. There&#x27;s no other admin account to login to (default admin account is disabled - I&#x27;m not a total idiot. Yes, yes I know, exposing NAS to the internet etc etc).
 I get my son, who&#x27;s at home, to reboot the NAS hoping it&#x27;s a temporary blip. Nope. Still cannot login as the MFA code isn&#x27;t working.
 At this point my imagination is running wild and I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s been hacked and the MFA for my admin account has been reset to the hacker&#x27;s phone. Other normal user accounts (non-MFA) are working. The data is still there, no encrypted files or anything else untoward seems to be going on. So, what the hell? 
 I check Synology forums and see posts about the time sync possibly being off but that isn&#x27;t the case. I&#x27;m on the verge of asking my son to press the dreaded Reset button when I have a thought. I have a Active Directory domain at home and a single Zetec mini-PC box acting as DC. This also provides DNS for the home network. It couldn&#x27;t be that could it? Why would that affect MFA on the NAS? 
 I get my son to check if the Zetec box is on. It wasn&#x27;t. Soon as that was powered up and the DNS services started, MFA started working again. 
 Bloody DNS man....

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/yos5yj/how_is_a_data_room_different_than_collaborating/">

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Currently we are using a virtual data room solution that costs $6,000 for 2GB of storage and an additional $2000 per GB, so I am up to $8k annually. That seems really insane to me, and we are likely going to need to increase it to 4GB totaling 10K annually.
 I looked at other cloud storage solution providers, and for example, Box.com&#x27;s Enterprise plan will allow me to only need to license internal users and all external users are free.
 With that, I could seemingly achieve the same thing for $2500 (5-6 internal users) instead of $8000. Not only that, but it includes unlimited storage as well which is a HUGE selling point to me.
 My use of our current data room solution solely exists to provide company financial files to investors. All that I need is activity audit logging, MFA, and granular permissions. It&#x27;s used maybe once a year for a month or so during investor rounds, which makes the price tag even more painful.
 While we have SharePoint, I keep SharePoint use to internal only because its confusing to people, permission management is a PITA with external users, and audit reporting is no easy feat. I also want that clear delineation to employees to understand internal and external. I am just saying this so that I am not asked why I don&#x27;t just use SharePoint for this.
 Is there something missing that I don&#x27;t understand between the definition of a &quot;data room&quot; and just normal cloud storage setup to share with external/guest users?
 If you go look at Citrix ShareFile, theres specifically a data room tier that drops you from unlimited storage to 5GB of storage, and costs $448 a MONTH. Why is that a thing??
 Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: Based on the comments explaining the differences, it seems like we may be using a data room when we don&#x27;t really need one for our specific purposes. I&#x27;ll evaluate the other options. Thank you for the clarification!

She wanted to do some work on the train and asking if there was wifi on the train or is there a device she can buy for wifi for her laptop with a cellular service.
 ​
 Someone said just use the phone hotspot. I don&#x27;t use mine that much but even my kids know about the feature that&#x27;s been around for years now. back in the early 2000&#x27;s I thought that once more people learn computers our jobs will be in danger, but seems like computers are going the same way as cars. as time goes on people know even less about them and our jobs are safe

My bosses always ask for all kinds of documentation and to brain dump everything I know to a coworker with the same title and access as me. Sorry, but I’m not going to train someone on all kinds of things I taught myself on my own time. And definitely not going to break my back when I’m on my way out.
 Edit: I will document important processes, complete any of my remaining tickets. However, I’m not going to train someone to be on my level when those people have already been there but didn’t take any initiative to learn.

                              <span>I have a crazy issue with joining my 22H2 W11 machine to an Active Directory domain running on my Zentyal 7 server. I can ingress the domain and use any W10/W11 21H2 machine with no issues, and can ingress (using domain credentials) onto the domain with the 22H2 machine, but when I try to login with ANY domain user, it says the password is incorrect.
 I&#x27;ve set the minimum SMB version as SMB2 on Zentyal, but it didn&#x27;t fix the issue.
 I&#x27;m not sure what can I do to investigate the issue further, as I don&#x27;t receive eny error code.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how to track the cause of the issue? 
 Edit: Seems it&#x27;s related to this bug 15197 – Windows 11 22H2 and Samba-AD 4.15 Kerberos login issue with the solution being setting up a separate samba server for 22H2 machines, or not updating to 22h2 until the next Zentyal version releases. Fuck me

 But wifi still works, did i do something wrong?
 Systeminformation shows that credential guard is running. LsaIso Process is running. Was there any change on MS side?

Not my idea but that’s how it was and that’s how it Hass to stay as no money has been allocated towards a load balancer has anyone ever done this? I’m thinking if I put the renewal script on each of them one of them will have the DNS Record of a given time, and then it will sync up through the Dag.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 a certain user experiences problems whenever he logs into the terminal server and does a query which produces a huge amount of rows. The query just crashes his whole desktop and file system. No files can be created and no paths found. Trying to close any program gives an error message that states the path of the program could not be found. 
 I also can&#x27;t access his virtual hard drive as the path can&#x27;t be found. The only solution is to log him out with task manager and relog into the server. 
 Is it possible that this could have something to do with too little memory on our volume? There are only a couple of MB left and this is the volume where all our virtual hard disks are stored.

                              <span>Hello Dear Sysadmin 
 Our Org is planing to move direction cloud and implementing the usage of Microsoft 365 Services.
 One Point to calculate is backup. I am trying to find a good solution that is price effective. Actually i&#x27;m looking at some solutions like avepoint, Veeam, you name it ... there are dozens of BaaS (Backup as a Service) solutions out there. In a nutshell all works similar you pay per user and Month - and i don&#x27;t like it this way. Call me Old bastard if you want :) 
 Later i stumbled across Synology &quot;Active Backup for Microsoft 365&quot;. An app running on your local NAS (synology ones obviously). If i understood right, there is no additional licencing beside of &quot;owning a compatible NAS&quot;. We have allready some of this maschines running without any trouble/issues for year as Cheap local Backup Storage Targets. 
 For me, there are two main important things. 1) Price and 2) Stability of the product. And i like to have backups &quot;on-prem&quot; the &quot;classic&quot; way (3 times and different places). 
 Now im wondering if i find here some &quot;real life&quot; Opinions about this setup? Any good for an organisation with 150 Users? 
 Thanx!

 ​
 I need to install .NET 3.5 Feature on a fully patched Windows 2012 R2 server, but I am failing...
 ​
 What I tried:
 Install with ServerManager - Additional Source - Win2012R2-DVD\sources\sxs added -&gt; 0x800f081f
 C:\Windows\System32&gt;DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source:&quot;d:\sources\sxs&quot;
 --&gt; Same problem
 ​
 Do you have any idea on how to solve this?
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

I thought it would be best to access all my files, sync it with OneDrive and back up the virtual machine with this account once a day. After digging through all the settings, I did not find an option that allows such access. I currently have a microsoft administrator account.

 The URL follows the same preset

 0 &#x3D; numbers only
 ​
 Backstory:
 At my work we use this internal service. To log in, we are given a URL with a random key. The key stays the same the whole time you work here. They claim this is secure because the key is random. But i cant possible think this is secure. I have confirmed with my colleage that if i use his link. I log on as him.
 This is not intended to be nefarious, but to prove its not as secure as they think it is and hopefully get them to change it.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 i have some troubels with the Printer Rolle on Server 2019. The installed Drivers are from Konica Minolta and Up to date, the Printers are allready Installed, ant The Windows Updates are up to date. The same Printers are woking on my 2016 Server but we want a migratopn to 2019 Server. The Problem is, I can Print a Test page from each Server directly (2016 &amp; 2019) but from my client ( Windows 10 ) i can normaly connect an view all settings with the printer, but i cant print on the 2019 Server.
 The 2019 Serve Log is:
 📷
 &quot;Event 812: Printer Service
 &quot;The printer spooler failed to delete C:\Spool\\FP00001.SHD, Error Code 0x2&quot;
 ​
 ServerLOG
 The Folder hast NTFS Permisions for Full Control on - System -&gt; Creator -&gt; Users
 The Settings are the same and the NTFS is the same as on the 2016 Server, no changes.
 On The Client i got a Error:
 (Error 0x00000bbb) The operation could not be completed. No print job could be created.
 Can anyone help me, any ideas or anything similar to watch for ?
 Thanks and BR

                              <span>We use a Windows 2016 server to run print jobs for our ERP system. All printing is direct - no print servers/sharing involved.
 For the past year, it seems like about 50% of Microsoft&#x27;s updates breaks our printers. The exact scenario is: post-update, about 90% of the printers will have been defaulted to duplex printing, and about 90% of the printers will be using the generic Microsoft printer driver. (Note that these two groups do not always overlap; sometimes a printer will still have the correct driver, but will have been changed to duplex printing, or vice-versa.) This is not printer or driver specific; it occurs across several different makes/models and drivers.
 Fixing it is a relatively simple, but frustrating process: Just go into each printer&#x27;s &quot;Advanced &gt; Printing Defaults...&quot; and disable duplex. Afterwards, both issues will be resolved.
 We attempted to resolve this with a simple bit of Powershell, set to run (as admin) on system startup:
  $printers &#x3D; Get-Printer foreach($printer in $printers){ Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode &#x27;OneSided&#x27; } 
 However, Set-PrinterConfiguration only works after the printer has been manually fixed. Otherwise, it generates the following error:
  Set-PrintConfiguration : Could not access configuration information for the specified printer. At C:\Scripts\Set_SingleSidedPrinting.ps1:7 char:5 + Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (MSFT_PrinterConfiguration:ROOT/StandardCi...erConfiguration) [Set-PrintConfiguration], CimException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070002,Set-PrintConfiguration 
 Very frustrating. Any ideas how to resolve things? Either so that Windows Updates no longer cause the printing issue, or so that our script can reliably run, post-update?

                              <span>I swear i&#x27;m going insane and it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard.
 The &quot;new&quot; Windows Terminal is everything i want. Except, sometimes, pasting passwords over SSH plain won&#x27;t work. Pasting the Password without a sudo prompt or such shows the correct text, but when asked for a password by ansible or sudo, only typing does it. No idea why. It has also been laggy when connected to Servers with a less than ideal connection. Not sure why my Input depends on the connection to the customer?
 So, suffice to say, i&#x27;m not happy with windows Terminal. Alacritty does everything great, except it doesn&#x27;t have tabs.
 Putty also doesn&#x27;t have tabs plus it&#x27;s session management is... less than ideal.
 So, what do i do? My requirements are pretty basic. All Windows stuff can be done through PS. So all i really need is something that can do SSH, Tabs, maybe split windows. Stored sessions are a nice to have, but i&#x27;m fine copy pasting IPs and using my SSH config. Right Click Paste would be nice, but Ctrl+V works too. It should use Windows&#x27; build in OpenSSH, not putty and Pageant. Other than that, it should be responsive and work as expectet 100% of the time.
 What do those of you that Use SSH for admin tasks all day, but also need to use Windows, use?

                              <span>Hello,
 We are currently deploying an web app that uses our AD infrastruture to login users.
 However I have some users that I only want to allow the login through this app (web app with ldap login). Is there any way I can lock these accounts to dont allow login into anycomputer at all on the doman?

 ​
 ​
 I Need to know whether a physical cable is connected to a network port on your Windows Server system. I can see link status via ethtool command in Linux machine.
 Is there any equilavent command for Windows?
 ​
 thanks,

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently began a project of replacing a Windows storage space fileserver with a TrueNAS fileserver
 I&#x27;ve recently downloaded brand new Windows and Linux ISO&#x27;s and stored them on our new storage server and when we try and add the ISO to the virtual machine, I get the following error:
 Failed to add device &#x27;Virtual CD/DVD Disk&#x27;.
 User account does not have permission to open attachment
 Originally, I googled this, and I added the delegation in Active Directory but that didn&#x27;t work.
 Has anyone else experienced this same problem?

 They have provided IP addresses that the scans will come from. What would be a good custom HTTP response for our Web Application Firewall that will end up stored in their database?

                              <span>I use to be a real go-getter. I&#x27;d be up at 7:00 am, I&#x27;d be scripting, I&#x27;d be documenting, I&#x27;d be on calls helping out people, I&#x27;d be helping teammates even if they didn&#x27;t ask for it, I&#x27;d volunteer for tasks, I&#x27;d be working late or on the weekends trying to get something done or working the way I wanted it.
 Now? Fuck all that.
 I did that for years, and I&#x27;d see people getting promoted and then try to figure out what I did wrong. Or at the end of the year my review comes back with all &#x27;meets&#x27;, and just get the standard raise. At my third job, it hit me like a baseball in the nuts with a simple comment from another co-worker. 
 &quot;Why, the boss didn&#x27;t tell me to do it&quot;
 It&#x27;s that simple. All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you. Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a &quot;good job&quot; comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in
 After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime). 
 That&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t do anything extra. I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc. That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next. 
 I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it&#x27;s just a job and I&#x27;m going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.
 Also, remember the rule of 5. How will it affect you in 5 minutes, 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years?

 My company is full of wonderful people. I have only one boss, the CFO, and so far I wasn&#x27;t even once told &quot;no&quot; when it came to invest money in IT - he understands that IT is critical and make sure every budget I ask for is approved. When I ask for something and it&#x27;s expensive, he simply asks me to explain so that he can chose the better option. He&#x27;s also excellent with Excel, so all the Excel related questions go to him.
 People are usually very nice. Sometimes a little demanding, but also very grateful. I answer all calls because I&#x27;m the sole IT guy and I am perfectly aware that although I love engineering tasks more than user support, firs…</span>

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t worked in support for many years but still remember some of the nice things said to me during my time doing it. 
 One lady with poor vision almost crying when I took a screen magnifier to her and set it up, who just stared at it going &quot;wow&quot; over and over with a huge smile.
 The kids with learning disabilities who got touch screen iMacs which blew their mind and who wrote a theme some (based on Batman) which they sang anytime they saw me.
 The doctor who actually got down on his knees and kissed my feet (I was with a colleague at the time) after I fixed his long-problematic monitor issues (it was literally 5 mins to download/reinstall an Nvidia driver). He said he&#x27;d had over a dozen calls and six IT staff at his computer by this point.
 I&#x27;m going to be honest I&#x27;m easily pleased but when you do make a difference and see that impact on someone else it reminds some of us why we chose to work in support.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just implemented all the Anti-Phishing policies/security recommendations etc that Microsoft added in September.
 I&#x27;ve got 99,4% of my users &quot;affected by policies that are configured securely&quot;.
 But I&#x27;ve got 0.6% of my users &quot; affected by policies that are configured less securely than is recommended &quot;. 
 How do I go about finding these users? 
 Are there any good or efficient way of finding these users?
 I&#x27;m just thinking there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here:
 https://imgur.com/a/XMQcp4d 
 They even list how many users that are affected by the wrong (Default) policies. So my thinking is that I should be able to find these users in a list somehow.

 But what ticks me off (like crazy) is when my boss/manager says I&#x27;m not working and I&#x27;m wasting time at work. They seem to think I&#x27;m watching movies or playing games during work hours.
 How the hell do I tell them - hey gaffer, I have NO interest in watching movies or playing game during work hours because if I do that, I&#x27;ll never get any tickets done.
 Crazy thing is it has happened in my previous job when we were back to working from the office for all 5 days in a week and my boss still said I looked like I was not being efficient at work. WTF. I was in the same room as him and he saw me with my eyes glued to the screen and…</span>

                              <span>So, we have many Dell Latitude 5420 laptops. I7 11th gen.
 We have some random many users having issue with usb ports not recognized after random working hours. They need to restart the laptop in able for the ports to work again.
 Troubleshooting Done:
 - updated all bios, firmware and drivers
 - removed thunderbolt port connected from monitor to laptop
 - used direct usb port connection (mouse and kb direct to laptop) - &gt; works for 1 week but error prompt again.
 Any of you have any idea why this Dell Laptop have this annoying USB port issue?

                              <span>Hi all. Just a stupid question.
 I have multiple VMs running in an isolated network and want them to isolate, but I&#x27;d like to access them through the VPN connection. So as a solution I&#x27;m going to use one VM with the public IP, set up a firewall, and OpenVPN server. Also, I&#x27;m going to add authentication for the OpenVPN through the OpenLDAP server and redirect all routing for the VMs from the isolated network using this primary VM. So this primary VM will work as a router.
 So what kind of OS should I use for it?
 For now, I have created an ansible playbook that set up everything required using Ubuntu Server LTS. But I&#x27;ve read that Ubuntu is OS for the users and it&#x27;s better to use BSD family OSes like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, or even OPNsense for the network devices.

How can this be be free? Any one knows that this cloud versij is reliable enough?

                              <span>I made the (apparent) mistake of purchasing a Mellanox/NVidia SN2100 switch with onie installed on it. I am not a networking guy; I knew that it would not be as easy as plugging the switch in an it would work immediately - but I also didn&#x27;t realize that I needed to build an operating system to make it work At the moment I have a $10,000 door stop; I have cloned the onie repo and attempted to build for Mellanox and then I started working through issues (this library isn&#x27;t installed, that tool isn&#x27;t installed..) for about 1.5 hours before reaching an error indicating that I should not be a root user, but then nothing works unless I am root so...?? In looking through the onie repo the SN2100 isn&#x27;t even listed as supported hardware and it hasn&#x27;t been updated for 5-8 years. 
 Is there an image on the switch that works somewhere, or is this something that everyone has to deal with? How do I get an OS that is made for the switch and works properly?
 It seems crazy to me that a company would sell a product that is so expensive and then just have a pointer to an open source project and not even say &quot;good luck, have fun! lol&quot;. :(

                              <span>Scouting a network in the morning and my LAN Toner is dead - so I have nothing to tone line network lines with tomorrow.
 Is there a way with windows or Kali Linux to force a link flap or port flash?
 I tried Ethtool on kali, but due to my NIC not being compatible - it fails to work.
 As stated - quick and dirty is okay here - I just want to connect to a live ethernet line and force the port it connects to to blink at a consistent rate. I have used tool that do this in the past, but was hoping something could be done with bash or PowerShell.
 ​
 Thank you in advanced for any help you may provide!
 ​
 edit: to clarify, one of this reason I am not using switching functions is because the hardware may all be unmanaged, and if it is managed - I will not have the credentials. Additionally, I know one goal is to identify why some APs are offline - if the cable is live but PoE is not being provided, I want to be able to find the other end of the cable.

Recently, my company was robbed. We have a roughly 3500 sqft warehouse/retail space, and roughly then yard portion of the business takes up an entire city block or so. I&#x27;ve installed a series of ubiquiti access points/networking equipment (password protected wifi) around the yard and have fairly solid coverage. Some guys hopped the fence, stole a truck, rammed it through several garage doors, then out our fence. They initially broke one of the garage doors at 10:15PM, police did not arrive on scene until nearly 11:30PM. They were in the yard at least 30 minutes prior to breaking the garage door which alerted myself/boss. The perpetrators …</span>

                              <span>We have two office locations in front of each other. To connect the two offices, I’m planning on using some Ubiquiti AirFibre modules.
 For the purpose of the network, the AirFibre is like having an Ethernet cable between the two locations.
 Each of the two locations will have - Router - Switch - Separate and dedicated ISP internet connection
 Between these two locations, I would like to: - Access network resources that exist on either network - Use the other internet service as a backup
 My questions: 
  
How could I interconnect this? 
 What rules would I need to use?
  
Would: - “wireless cable 1” connect from network switch and LAN from office A to office B router - “wireless cable 2” from from network switch and LAN of office B to the office A router - setup a static route for the other office LAN on each office router to pass through the wireless link and to the other router - have a rule that passes WAN traffic normally through the local ISP, and through the wireless link interface if the ISP is down

                              <span>Bit of my history. I was a Network Engineer from 1997-2005, had my CCNA cert and worked for a nationwide ISP in Austin until I was let go during the tech bust. I decided to move in to Tech recruiting then other fields and never went back to the Networking world.
 I am now 54 and pondering getting back in to Networking. I am thinking of doing some online courses and/or tutorials to get my CCNA and putting the feelers out but my worry is that I have lost too much knowledge &amp; expertise and that my age will be a hinderance when seeking employment. 
 Would love to hear any thoughts or advice you could provide. TYIA

                              <span>Hi guys. So I have an issue in our small office network. This network has been up for over 4 years and this issue started about 6 months ago. Users will get kicked off of their internet connection intermittently. This mostly occurs during video calls, especially if there are multiple people on the same call.
 Network setup: WAN: Verizon FIOS 1GB Router: TP-LINK ER7206 Switch: Netgear Prosafe: GS724TPv2 AP: Ubiquiti UniFi U6-LR-US
 This issue started about 6 months ago. The router I had then was a Cisco router and Aruba AP. I swapped both those out and have the configuration above.
 Was hoping someone had some ideas where to go next? Thanks

                              <span>For a project we require a 802.03at midspan injector, preferably rackmount. Since the networked hardware (FPGA module) is not our own design, we can not send the appropriate type 2 message in order to negotiate 30W delivery as the standard requires. Does anyone know of an injector which delivers 30W per port without requiring the handshake? Thanks a lot in advance!

                              <span>I have a temporary setup for allowing multiple network clients to access a shared VPN resource. I have a Windows PC connected to the internet and sharing it&#x27;s VPN connection to a switch over ethernet and it&#x27;s working very well for all connected devices. I&#x27;ve used this setup before and it&#x27;s easy with everything else I have running. Right now, it&#x27;s all wired. 
 My question is: if that were to be shared on open wifi instead of ethernet, what dangers to the host/&quot;main&quot; network would there be?
 I know that if I were using a normal router for this, I&#x27;d be concerned they would navigate to 192.168.1.1, enter a correct password or bypass an insecure login page, and wreak havok. So I would know that I need a secure router and a good password or I could put management on another VLAN. 
 I&#x27;m aware of possible concerns about peer security. Client isolation will be enabled in the access point to this network. 
 What concerns are there with Windows ICS &quot;acting as the router&quot;? Can clients configure ICS settings or somehow reach the Windows PC&#x27;s primary LAN? Would they be able to send commands to the Windows PC?

                              <span>Greetings folks, 
 I just wanted to ask your feedback on this situation:
 I&#x27;ve been hired as a network engineer at a mid sized hospital organization, that also is looking for sysadmins.
 In the meantime, after working on network related tasks for about 8 months, I&#x27;ve been asked to assist with server security remediation. It&#x27;s been understood that it&#x27;s not a typical job role, but the whole IS team has been chipping in here and there and I certainly don&#x27;t mind it given that its not all that much work.
 However, some of the maintenance cycles are scheduled for 10pm, on two Saturdays, and at 4am on the following two Sundays. 
 My question is, what server can possibly need to be updated at 4 in the morning? What&#x27;s wrong with running both cycles simultaneously at 8pm during weekdays?
 Has anyone encountered this and can give any insight?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there,
 We run ASA code on Cisco FP appliances. Some still need an upgrade to ASA version &gt;9.13. Appart from where to configure interfaces etc. does it matter if you run it in platform or appliance mode? Like performance wise?

                              <span>Do you have any recommended resources (pdfs, video courses) that will help me learn sd-wan deeply? I am more of taking practical exercises to understand the concept guy but I cannot afford any emulators as of this moment so any videos especially comprehensive lab setup of sd-wan will be very helpful to me. Thank you.

                              <span>I live in Michigan, and all my coworkers + myself who work from home for 3rd shift have terrible Internet really late at night when no one is awake but 3rd shifters.
 During the day, no issues at all, even at peak times like 12 PM or the evening.
 Since this is affecting presumably the entire state, I doubt anything will change to fix it.
 My question though is... why? An ISP phone technician will be unlikely to tell me, so I&#x27;m just curious if there would be any likely cause for these issues? Are they doing updates to their routers that just randomly knocks everyone off the Internet deep at night?
 I&#x27;m also curious if anyone else has had experiences like this themselves?

 Was trying to upgrade a Cisco C9300-24T to the latest version.
 I downloaded SFTP server from Solarwind where I uploaded the firmware to.
 The problem I have now is that the switch is stuck in &quot;switch&quot; mode. It happened when I tried to upgrade the firmware, see below:

                              <span>Morning,
 I&#x27;m looking for a reliable vendor which can provide me with a bunch of patch cables (mix of 0.5 - 3 meters and CAT6 / fiber SM, MM) for a new DC deployment. This is my first time ordering and requesting quotes for cables and i would like to have them with labels to save time and errors.
 When searching online with Google etc. i find some companies which are operating in the US or basic guides on how to label your cables. Not exactly what i need.
 Do any of you have experience with some of the suppliers in the region of The Netherlands, Benelux or even Europe? And can recommend me a supplier?
 Thanks in advance!

 My internet provider uses coupler splitter. I want to connect fiber directly to my router, I’ve asked for an SFP module and they said I have to use model as pair both side. Any advice on this?

                              <span>Setup:
 Head Office (HO): Sophos XGS Firewall (For troubleshooting all security between the two offices is temporarily disabled)
 Branch Office (BO): Mikrotik 915G
 IPSEC configured between the sites.
 Printers at the branch office are connected via the VPN to the windows terminal server located in HO.
 BO staff connect to HO Terminal server and print documents from their application to their local printers. Printing is taking about 1 minute per page 200kb(according to the spooler) to print. The connectivity appears stable and i dont see packet loss across the link and there is about 70ms between the two. I&#x27;ve performed packet captures from the BO Side and the HO Side. I was hoping to get some indication of where and if the fault is with the link. Also note, we have 3 other BO&#x27;s connected to the HO with the exact same setup and no performance issues.
 After the initial handshake i see a large number of retransmissions from the HO Side with ACKs from the printer in the BO. This continues for about 15 seconds before a number of back and forwards of packets . After this, 10 seconds of what appears to be healthy communication occurs. I get a TCP Window full from the HO server to the BO Printer. The as well the ad the retransmissions and dup ACK returning. It continues this way for the next 20 seconds before a another flood of what appears to be healthy PSH/ACK communication. Finally ending in the FIN/ACK.

                              <span>Hi folks, sorry I&#x27;m not following any SecOps subs so not too comfortable posting elsewhere.
 We&#x27;ve been using the Windows Server CIS L1 benchmarks for a while, but are now looking to roll them out to some Citrix servers. On the surface nothing in the benchmark policies seem problematic for users, but I&#x27;m concerned that there may be additional User Rights Assignment type permissions required in the Citrix context.
 Has anyone used the CIS policies in a Citrix environment and can speak to any issues, or alterations they had to make to the policies to allow things to work properly?
 Cheers

                              <span>Can someone provide clarification on Azure Backup Schedule and RPO?
 &quot;With backup schedule set to Hourly, the default selection for start time is 8 AM, schedule is Every 4 hours, and duration is 24 Hours. Hourly backup has a minimum RPO of 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. You can set the backup schedule to 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours respectively.&quot;
 Recovery point objective (RPO): The amount of acceptable data loss if a recovery needs to be done
 Azure support hourly VM backup, however their RPO indicates that the schedule is a minimum of every 4 hours.
 So is a backup performed every 1 or 4 hours? Or are they saying that even through you&#x27;ve set to hourly we will only guarantee a backup every 4 hours? If so than that&#x27;s somewhat poor.

                              <span>We live in Canada and the last couple of Winters we have been getting more and more power losses due to storms. We average about 10-15 over the Fall/Winter season, and they often last for several hours.
 I recently identified an issue with a UPS we have (Cyberpower) where it does not take over immediately upon power loss, so the last few winters when I thought it was taking over, our Dell PowerEdge R220 server has been shutting off (not gracefully) every power outage.
 I am working on getting a good UPS in place with network SNMP traps that is more reliable -- thinking Tripp Lite as I have had good luck with them in the past. Let me know if there is anything specific I should be looking for when it comes to UPS purchases for a small server rack for a local business with a server, NAS, modem, and a couple other small devices.
 I was thinking something along the lines of https://www.cdw.ca/product/tripp-lite-1000va-ups-smart-avr-w-installed-webcardlx-1urm/3826234?pfm&#x3D;srh
 For the server itself... we currently have WD GOLD 3.5&quot; Enterprise HDD in there. Would there be any advantage to power loss data prevention by switching to the WD GOLD SSD with the power loss prevention feature? I have been looking for an excuse to move them over to SSDs, but only if it is a good safe guard against power loss. I know standard SSDs are not good for power loss protection, but are SSDs with power loss protection any better than the WD GOLD Enterprise HDDs I mentioned?
 The server we have also has an H310 raid controller and I was wondering if switching to H710p would offer any advantages to maintaining data integrity during a power outage? I understand the performance and IOPS difference between the two but not sure if one is better than the other for handling power loss.
 There&#x27;s lots more info I could provide but just doing a quick write up for now.

 We are required to sign into our devices every two weeks, for some reason IOS Outlook always makes us authenticate twice, as in use authenticator, enter 2 digit number, then repeat. It works fine after that, but does anyone know what causes this?
 Thanks!

 I am after opinions on windows remote monitoring solutions that can monitor essentials in WDS10,11 and WDS SVR, is windows up to date?, pull SSD/HDD Smart data and tell me of problems, temperature monitoring, ram usage. so far I bet 99% of you have a solution in mind now to make it harder. 
 I support a few different company&#x27;s but each company has its own needs so an onsite version assessable to some local support (this is for transparency of work done)
 I really do not want it to hijacking windows update services like a lot of the managed IT solutions do, windows is perfectly capable of running its own updates but if the major monthly update is not done 3 months later I just want to…</span>

                              <span>Hello All,
 What are some good places where I could do the odd weekend or evening working remotely freelance? I moved jobs a few months ago from a hands on technical role with a very broad skill set to more of a team lead / architect role in the cloud space. I honestly miss jumping from fixing a broken DC to patching a RHEL template to creating new segments in NSX-T. I can also feel my broad skill set fading away already and I don’t like the idea of being an IT manager in 10 years time struggling to remember what DNS does!
 So do you any of you do any remote freelance work at the weekend and if so how can I get involved? I only see it as a win win, it keeps my skills sharp and I’m getting paid!
 Thanks for your replies

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have a mostly WFH job in IT which requires the occasional local onsite visit. However, recently my company have mentioned they want to potentially send me to a large city that is roughly 6 hours away (flying or driving, all travel is expensed) for a week out of every month for a project that’s expected to last a year or longer. 
 Travel time are hours that go on the timesheet to make up my 40 hours for the week. A hotel and car will be provided. All work related expenses can be expensed if I provide a receipt. If driving my own car, I can expense the gas at .55c/km, which adds a nice small bump to my pay cheques.
 My main concern is that a quarter of my year will be spent away from home and family. I don’t have kids, only a girlfriend who would miss me being home but can deal with it. After a while, I don’t think I will really be able to enjoy my leisure time when the day is finished if I cannot go home to relax. 
 It would be a decent learning experience but it’s experience I could get locally as well. I make under $60k CAD (~45k USD) in Ontario.
 I enjoy my job but feel they are asking a bit much of me. My boss implied that travel is part of the job but I feel that there needs to be additional monetary compensation.
 Do any of you guys receive compensation for this type of extended travel for long projects? What do you think should I be asking for? Is it just part of the job? 
 Thanks in advance for any input.

He said that I should be monitoring tickets and emails. And I am infringing on what we spoke about when I got my warning. My phone hasn&#x27;t rung and my work phone was charging. Also my normal phone has a problem where every hour or so I get notifications in waves and doesn&#x27;t help the fact that we have a shared inbox that once someone else reads it the notification goes away. But I feel like I am on call and I am salary isn&#x27;t this wrong that I have to be checking emails and tickets even if I don&#x27;t receive a call?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working in a support role for SaaS products and have been considered moving laterally to a company in order to build experience with products which are more likely to exist long term and are more aligned with tech I am interested in personally. I have been considering that I&#x27;m taking where I start in entry level/first admin jobs too seriously, especially with how fast paced technological change is. but I wanted to ask the more experienced crowd here what they thought.
 ​
 How much influence did the first job you had in IT influence where you are now? Interested in company, field, and how the products you support and use have changed.

I know how to transfer the files from server a to server b. What is the best way to mitigate the fall out of the end users scripts from not working. Is there a way to redirect the name from server a to server b, or should I just rename server B to be the original name of server a.

                              <span>Increasingly this sub is more and more about people just bitching about work instead of sharing useful information about doing work.
 Can we limit these sort of post to a specific day, or better yet have them done elsewhere.
 We all need to vent I get it, but it&#x27;s getting to the point where that seems to be a primary focus here.
 I get that this post too is off topic but is to address an issue with the sub, not I hate my life/boss/job/world.
 [edit]
 It is sad to see that so many people can&#x27;t distinguish between an invitation to discuss the content of this sub and it&#x27;s moderation, and a rant.

 Is this just me or are other people seeing a change in attack traffic?

 I’m looking for an NTP and POE powered digital clock. Have you had success with any particular vendor?
 I found this but I’m not sure how reliable they are:

                              <span>I am hosting a few WordPress blogs for people (for free) and I am wondering how I would set this up in a better way than I currently have it. 
 Currently, I just run all the WordPress sites on my server directly and they all share one MySQL/MariaDB instance. However, sometimes there are things to be done via ssh, or they want a db dump or a backup etc.
 I was wondering if anyone could think of a good way how I can give those people more access to their own WordPress sites without giving them access to the server or other people&#x27;s sites with the least work for me. I was thinking of deploying WordPress and MySQL in a docker container and just installing ssh in that docker container so everyone could access their own container?

                              <span>Hi
 I have to write a document describing IT infrastructure of a real-world company/business including hardware, software, network components and deciding whether to use cloud infrastructure or tradition infrastructure with on premises servers. I decided to choose car dealership company which would be small and more specific to design. We are allowed to design it as we think rather than finding the actual infrastructure of the chosen company. My chosen company is John Hughes which is a car dealership business here Australia, Perth, WA. 
 Any input on how to approach the design, components to think of and what components or how actual IT infrastructure looks like for a car dealership business would be highly appreciated. They would need support for inventory management, sales, customer relations but what else should I be thinking of. 
 Cheers

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking into this for a while now, and still coming up short. We&#x27;re a non-profit in a small country with horrible internet access. Our 4 locations are basically small, gated cities. The big center has essentially the leadership (government), a medical clinic, a store, a school, and 70 residences. Nearby is the airport and aviation team. The other 3 remote locations are each about 10 homes and an office. Each center relies on a single internet connection for everything (houses, et al) at that location.
 We have an IT team of only 6, all at the central location. Our documentation is old, disorganized, and thus hard to go through and find what you need. I think we&#x27;re making progress though.
 Computers are a mixed bag of domain computers and BYOD. Letting a tool scan the network has always given unwieldy results or so many results there&#x27;s not a clue where to start.
 The issue is that we have no idea WHAT we&#x27;re managing, and that needs to change. We&#x27;ve setup a trial of iDoit and had a go. It&#x27;s a nice tool, but perhaps too manual. We have PRTG that can help, but it&#x27;s got so many alarms from &quot;false&quot; devices found during the auto-scan.
 The question is...what are others using for inventory and documentation? I&#x27;m looking for a tool that can tell me what devices are where with what configuration. Hopefully, something that can schedule maintenance and show a change history.
 I&#x27;ve been googleing on and off for months, finding a lot of sales pitches and promises. Maybe a short trial, maybe not. I&#x27;m hoping that by asking here, perhaps the options can be twiddled down to a good couple instead of what I&#x27;m (not) finding.

                              <span>We are in the process of simplifying our network and services. I do not like Azure (We used to use 365 but now have moved away and using GSuite instead) and simply want to only use our onsite AD which Azure is connected to. What is the best way of disconnecting Azure without causing a load of issue like disconnecting and someone tries to logd on and say there isn&#x27;t a trust relationship etc things like that? Has anyone done this and what was the result?

                              <span>I’m currently running my own business as an IT Consultant with a few clients. I’ve setup a windows server, recommended and implemented software for job duties and done all kinds of IT and business related tasks for these small businesses. However I want to move away from that and specialize in network/security instead of being the general business/IT consultant. I had my resume professionally done, what would you change?
 Resume here
 For one, I’m going to remove the life insurance license as that’s not relevant.
 Do you guys think I should elaborate on the sales experience, given that soft skills are important?
 I’m looking for a job with an MSP or Helpdesk t3 or jr system admin. 
 Thanks in advance! :)

 https://jay.gooby.org/2022/05/06/use-a-basic-gmail-account-to-send-mail-as-with-a-domain-that-uses-cloudflare-email-routing#:~:text&#x3D;In%20your%20Cloudflare%20dashboard%2C%20click,to%20you%20to%20confirm%20this. 
 I have successfully completed it as directed in the guide. The emails are being received on Gmail. However, my emails sent from custom email addresses are going to junk (outlook) and promotional tab (Gmail).
 I think the problem here is: DKIM record. I don&#x27;t think Google allows to access the keys for a simple Gmail user. One has to sign in to Workspace which I think is not free.
 I have tested with an email tester.
 https://app.mailgenius.com/spam-test/5ecbb9
 How do I proceed with this?
 My goal is:
  
To send/receive domain emails on Gmail instead of using a custom SMTP.
 I prefer the freebie approach. Do let me know if there&#x27;s any free SMTP that allows sending around 3000 emails/month.

                              <span>I am an intern at a company, my company recently asked me to create multiple vm on a windows 10 machine (it has 128gigs ram, Intel xeon processor and good amount of storage), lets call this host machine.
 Now the host machine is situated in london and we are in Asia
 I used virtual box, made two virtual machines as per their requirements and enabled &quot;share display&quot; in them and it worked. But it has 1 second input lag and i couldn&#x27;t lower it. Company thinks it because i am using virtualbox and wants me to make two virtual machines in the host machine without using virtual box/vmware.
 The host machine runs windows server 2019 datacenter edition and it can be changed if i need it. The virtual machine must run windows 10/11.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting a few users that apparently have Teams Exploratory licenses on their accounts. Out of the blue. 
 They&#x27;ve been licensed since day one, we use an assortment of Basic/Standard M365 licenses, they&#x27;ve never been deactivated or stripped of their license.
 The only thing that comes to mind and they have in common is every single one of them has had their licensing upgraded from Basic to Standard at some point.
 Everyone on the initial license plan is not affected, they have their Teams according to their M365 license.
 Has anyone encountered this behaviour? I&#x27;m not able to reproduce it while switching licensing plans for a user.
 Thank you for any feedback

                              <span>This happened recently.
 Worked for a few years at an organization where I was siloed into managing an image deployment system which, already klunky, became a bit worse as it was built-out. Could not utilize SCCM instead, could not switch to a non-MS solution &#x27;because&#x27;. The imaging solution was not meant for this, it was meant for something more basic. Regardless, after some initial training from the local Egg I did what I needed to keep this system afloat. I was &quot;the guy&quot; though I didn&#x27;t like it because I knew there were better solutions out there. Also, people at the other end were messing things up despite us training them. (They got better after a while, that eventually worked out.)
 I said several times before I left, to my supervisor and those before her, that a) I was not interested…</span>

                              <span>New to the Dell switches, my existing Cisco switch has the config below.
 router ospf 1000
 network 10.#.#.# 0.0.255.255 area 0
 network 192.#.#.# 0.0.0.15 area 0
 On the Dell after entering the router ospf 1000 line, it does not have the &quot;network&quot; command available, it does have the &quot;area&quot; command available. Not sure if that&#x27;s the correct way to go and if instead of specifying the Cisco wildcard, I need to use the subnet?

                              <span>TLDR: What do I do with all this stuff
 I work for a mid size documentary company in NYC. For the last two years our data closet has sat gathering dust, and I got fed up with a perfectly good 80TB of shared storage sitting unused. So I took a photo of all the various serial numbers, brute-forced the passwords (they were all the defaults - go figure), and bought the company’s first PC to see what I could do.
 Here’s a list of the equipment on our rack from top to bottom: - D-Link DGS-1210-16 (not connected to anything) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “LAN”) with cat6 cables running to stations - HP1920-48G network switch (labeled “LAN S”) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “PHONE”, the phones and their breadboard-looking-box have been removed) - CISCO Catalyst switch (Labeled “PHONE S”) - NETGEAR ProSafe XS712T switch (with one fiber expansion port, connected via fiber to NAS, and Ethernet to LAN, second NAS) - 24-port RJ45 patch box with mix of Cat 5e, 6, and 6e ports that run to CAT7 cables to edit stations - Synology DS1618+ - Synology DS3617xs
 My goal is to get an office network up and running with the CAT7 lines running 10Gb to edit stations and Cat6 lines running 1Gb to producers stations. From there, I want to host a server for Signiant Media Shuttle that will allow my NAS both through my router’s firewall and to the office network. I presume this means it all has to go through either the 10Gb or 1Gb switch (or both?). My office has 1Gb fiber through Verizon, and we have their router.
 If anyone out there has any advice for me, or can point me to good resources, I would greatly appreciate it.

 Ours currently is single uplink into a small 5-8 port switch with a link to each Firewall. But I just don&#x27;t like it... It feels budget and it feels wrong...

                              <span>Most of our customers don‘t have an monitoring program. So troubleshooting is difficult. However, sometimes I want to show them just a traffic live graph from there switches fast. Snmp is mostly still enabled.
 Do you now a good tool for a windows client, where you can fast enter id and community and get an live graph from the output?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m been using more and more python in my job to automate and build network tools. I&#x27;m beginning to find it very satisfying to build out tools, interact with APIs, build web interfaces, etc.
 I&#x27;m getting some envy of people who get to do this everyday. Network Engineering seems to have a limit of how creative you can be. A lot of what I do is troubleshooting and proving the network is not the cause of X issue. It would be nice to not have to answer to end users and just focus on building stuff.
 Has anyone else felt this way? Maybe this is just a grass is always greener situation. I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and feel like I&#x27;m too old to transition to SE.

We haven&#x27;t made any changes at the firewall and I have opened it wide just for testing still no luck. Have tried switching our public IP in case we got blacklisted somewhere. Tried a packet capture but don&#x27;t really see any traffic going to the IP the domain resolves too. The site works fine outside the network. I have contacted them to see if they have any clue why. Anything else I should try?

I have a router that passes /56 IPv6 delegation via DHCPv6 just fine while routing its own 64 itself.

 It works with PFsense and EdgeRouter, I have done that before. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m dealing with WS2022 and is quite surprised how antiquated the Routing feature is. Obviously, switching to PFsense or any better Linux-based router is not an option, (otherwise I&#x27;d do that in a flash). What I have tried so far:
  
Trying to see if DHCPv6 Delegation works as-is (apparently Windows never supported that

 Build a nonblocking and Fault-Tolerant network that accommodates 10,000 servers equipped with two 10Ge NICs.
 ​
 My answer, 
 To make it Fault-Tolerant I will have two routers between the routers on the client side and the external router which will be connected with other ASs. Configure one as the active and the other as the standby. The two routers will use Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol to achieve this.
 I wasn&#x27;t able to say anything about which product to use so I said any router and switch that has 10Ge ports.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve just had a new CCTV Camera system added to our corporate WLAN by an external 3rd party vendor. The system streams 12 odd cameras to a heads-up display. Its scope was to be viewed on a wired device at a Station but it&#x27;s found its way to mobile devices (Tablets/Laptops) due to the flexibility and convenience this offers. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t optimize video well and is constantly eating around 100 Mbps (or more) per client. Our Wireless network is a Cisco-based WLC /w 802.11ac WAPs using 20 MHz wide channels for 2.4/5 GHz. So we&#x27;re really only good for about 100 Mbps half-duplex. 
 I&#x27;ve been doing some thinking about the problem and I cannot see if we can resolve this with the current Wireless setup even if we moved to wider channel widths or newer 802.11 technology. Not only would wider channels hurt the setup of the entire building but even with 2 clients, we&#x27;re going to have sub-optimal performance for all other clients in that airspace.
 Am I just underestimating the performance of the newer standard 802.11ac/802.11ax, or is this use-case better suited for Wired?

                              <span>I have set up DNS entry (with Route53) for *.tunnel.example.com and tunnel.example.com to point to 2 IPs of 2 different VMs for high availability, example 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2 . nginx as a reverse proxy is installed on both
 So when I enter app1.tunnel.example.com sometimes it is redirected to 1.1.1.1 server and sometimes to 2.2.2.2
 app1.tunnel.example.com, app2.tunnel.example.com..etc are dynamically generated, these are tunnels to privateIP exposed service, and the other end of the tunnel, the publicIP part from which you have access on the internet, is either server-1 1.1.1.1 or server-2 2.2.2.2, depending on which IP tunnel.example.com DNS has returned (load balancing between the 2 IPs)
 My problem is that sometimes the tunnel for app1.tunnel.example.com is on Server 1, but when acessing this host, the loadbalancer routes this traffic to server 2, and it results on an error
 I have actually made nginx reverse proxy to the end of the tunnel, sith proxy_pass
 What I want, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible with Nginx, is if the proxied server returns 404 on server 1, then re-route the request to the other nginx reverse-proxy server 2, but the URL has to remain app1.tunnrl.example.com on the search bar, 
 is it even networkingly possible? If yes and nginx is not the answer, then what could it be?
 Below is How I want the nginx.conf to look like on server1:
 Server { Listen 80; Location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4444/; proxy_intercept_error on; } error_page 404 &#x3D; @redirect; location @redirect { return 301 http://$host ON 2.2.2.2; #host here is app1.tunnel.example.com } } 
 Thank you, hope it was clear

                              <span>Hi redditors,
 basically, my PC had this issue a couple of times and this particular relapse wouldn&#x27;t allow me to connect to the Ethernet despite following 5 popular websites on this particular fix and even resetting my router/modem and disconnecting my LAN cable previously (which surprisingly worked). Does anyone have this same relapsing issue? Can I have some solutions that are not mentioned by the majority of the websites?

                              <span>I work at a fairly large MSP and I have been deploying a few Juniper switches lately. Personally I love them but they are very complex for the average tech to manage. We’re considering making them our flagship switch. They definitely hit our price and feature requirements but I’m worried they’re too complex for MSPs where the average tenure is only a few years.
 Anyone care to share their experience working at an MSP that uses Juniper?

                              <span>Hello All,
 Firstly, sorry if this question was asked already and solved somewhere. I was not able to find a solution for my specific case or anything close to it. Well, here is the problem I am facing:
 I am currently readying a server for production to launch a website, and it is an AMP stack on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS. This is for a professor at my university who I am currently working under, and the website serves as a portal to access their research and data. There are some unique circumstances regarding this server that I wanted to point out:
  
The MySQL version is 5.7. I know that it is outdated, but there is a lot of data(approx 65 GB), and the professor has said that upgrading it to MySQL 8.0 is not in question (It is running the latest PHP and Apache versions though).
 The websi…</span>

                              <span>We have a custom app that has to create a few thousand files at a time on a network share. With defender enabled, it randomly, but reliably, will fail to get a file lock on a new file. When defender is disabled, the behavior goes away. This seems to have gotten an order of magnitude worse starting this past Wednesday. Anyone have any ideas on where to start looking for the cause?

                              <span>Been really unhappy with Verizon lately , we have over 300 lines and about 6mos ago our rep changed and we’ve been handed to someone who basically doesn’t care about our account anymore and is no help. 
 Actual cell service has been getting worse and worse, especially since the 5G rollout. Anyone else notice this too? 
 T-Mobile is offering us and a buddy of mine in charge of a similar size account some unbeatable deals and savings to switch over to them. I’m a little reluctant because historically TMO has had less than great coverage than the big 2. But I think that has changed, at least from the testing I have done, I’m seeing better speeds and better coverage in most areas now. We do work all over our state, so it’s important that we have good coverage. 
 Am I making a mistake switching over to a smaller provider? Do you think I’ll have to deal with backlash? 
 My idea is to switch over 100+ iPads first since data on those isn’t a deal breaker like it would be for voice service. And do remote monitoring to see what the signal is in the areas we work, then if it’s a good fit, change over our smartphones. 
 Anyone else switch their company over and do you have any regrets?
 I don’t consider AT&amp;T a viable option at this point as their 5G rollout is so far behind and I did a bunch of testing last year and was not impressed.

                              <span>Is it possible to have multiple SRPs? I setup one for an app and it works fine. I copied it and created one for the second app but it ends up becoming the winning GPO and the first will no longer apply.
 Is it not designed to allow multiple SRPs and everything is supposed to be in one? One of them applies to a wider user base than the other, which is why there are two separate GPOs.
 Edit: I see that it is actually allowed but happens when it thinks there is a conflict so the better question is- why does it think there is a conflict? One of them is the path to Firefox, the other is the path to Zoom. Two different locations entirely. I&#x27;m not understanding where the conflict is.

                              <span>I am tired of seeing this “advice” on this subreddit. It is dangerous bullshit and it needs to stop.
 Your employer wants to let you walk after resigning? You thing they are idiots for letting you go? You think they can’t survive without you? You “built it with your barehands” and they can’t figure out your expert work? You think that matters? You think you can get a big payday by &quot;sticking around&quot; if you negotiate?
 If you believe for a second that a former employer, who screwed you over and underpaid you, will be kinder to you as a contractor? You are wrong. You are living a fantasy if you believe it.
 So, just ask them for $200 per hour to help them after you go. Easy money and you’ll show them how important you are. You’ll make a fortune proving them wrong. What can go wrong?

TSprint works when introduced as a workaround. Server 2019, rds/rdweb, drivers for printers installed on session hosts, etc. Thanks!

 Im in a mess and need help 😅 So a client has a DC running WinServer 2012 which is EOL in less than a year and the whole system is out of date (ESXi, server, switches etc...)
 I finally update all drivers of the physical server and update vmware to v7.0 3U
 Everything seems fine and all VM boots But now the domain controller isnt working correctly Nothing on the network is authenticating and the server itself cant launch the server manager without errors
 &quot;The specified domain controller could not be contacted&quot;
 I see that thoses services are not launching ; Windows time (error 1792) Netlogon (error 1068) Workstation (error 1068)
 Its the only DC what should i do ?

                              <span>Hello all, Hope you are having a better weekend than I am! We are a small environment (250-500 users and growing quickly). We have a company first this weekend as we find ourselves having to investigate an employee of wrongdoing (nothing illegal as of this moment). We believe this to be fairly standard misconduct and to be a fireable offense that will be proven quickly upon investigating the employee&#x27;s emails and files. Since this is my first time, what are some things to look out for? Legal issues we may run into? Best practices for this? How and when should I limit management access? I would even welcome personal experiences. Essentially everything we uncover and how we do it will be establishing our written policy that we should already have lol.

                              <span>Does anyone here have any familiarity with setting this up?
 I&#x27;ve just started a new job in a busy hospital laboratory, and sooo much time could be saved if the normal values just auto-verified in the computer without a lab tech having to pull it up in the computer, scan it, then hit verify to send the results to the EMR. Right now, only some of their chemistry tests auto-verify, so I know it&#x27;s possible. I&#x27;m gathering that the IT department there is notoriously slow (likely understaffed and not exactly giving priority to some lab passion project, understandably).
 Lab is on Cerner Millenium. I&#x27;m assuming that the set-up for this occurs in Cerner, but how? I&#x27;ve been taking some basic developing courses and would be happy to do this on the side as a portfolio project, but I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s possible or where to start. Obviously I&#x27;d have to talk to IT at some point but hoping to get some input here before I even bring it up (in case it&#x27;s absolutely crazy).
 As a side note, their Cepheid (COVID instrument) is not interfaced to Cerner at all, so they&#x27;re manually typing in the 100s of Flu/COVID/RSVs they get in a day and then having a 2nd tech do a clerical check, which is absolutely bananas for the volume they get. If anyone knows where to start on that one as well, I&#x27;d love to attempt to tackle it if it&#x27;s even remotely possible.
 TIA (and sorry if this is the wrong sub - I also posted in r/healthIT but not sure if that was right either - please redirect me)

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m a hardware engineer at some company. We have a device we collect data with that spits data out to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has compiled code on it that saves the data to its local files and sends these files back to a lab PC over a closed wifi network. None of these devices are connected to the internet.
 During our testing, we&#x27;re using Matlab to perform our testing procedures. Our auxiliary hardware is all reliant on proprietary Matlab drivers.
 To send commands to the RPi, we currently use Matlab to make a system call to Putty, which SSH&#x27;s into the RPi and executes local code on the RPi. We need to do this hundreds of times per test, and it currently takes a couple seconds per Putty call, so the time stacks up. To push/pull files off the RPi, we have Matlab make a system call to an SFTP server.
 My question is: how would you execute the commands on the RPi faster than making system calls to Putty? My scenario to test speed is to execute a copy file command from Matlab 20 times, and time the results. Number to beat is about 40 seconds for those 20 copies. I&#x27;ve tried using the Paramiko library in Python, but it was slower than Putty. I&#x27;ve also tried using a 3rd party Matlab plugin based around the Ganymede Java library, but there&#x27;s some problem with keys on our model of Rpi, even when I manually try to add keys to the RPi. My next move is a Python library called ssh2-python, but I need to get Visual on the lab PC, which will take some time given our IT situation.
 I was also toying with the idea of using TCP sockets in either Python or C++, but I&#x27;m not really familiar with TCP. I&#x27;m not a network person, so I&#x27;m kind of blindly stumbling from potential solution to potential solution. Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi,
 I‘m currently playing around with TLS ans self-signed certificates for internal services. There are quite a lot of tutorials on how to generate a root ca and an intermediate CA, while there are also Howtos for generating TLS certificates.
 As far as I understood, you sign the CSR of your intermediate by your root ca and your SSL csr by your intermediate CA. You import and trust the root ca and every certificate signed by the intermediate should be trusted too.
 Well. That doesn’t work. If I, for example, check the certificate of google with MacOS Certificate Assistant, the whole chain of trust is visible. If I check my certificate, I only see the TLS cert and the assistant cries about the untrusted intermediate certificate.
 It looks like the chain between root and intermediate is broken. If read the Wikipedia article about x509 and the lead me to more questions. It looks like the certificate only contents some basic information about it’s ca (in my case the intermediate) like public key ,algorithm, etc. but no information about the root ca. How ist my browser supposed to know who signed the intermediate ?
 Or is the information on Wikipedia not complete and I have to bundle the CAs certificates with my TLS cert ?
 I have an headache now. Please help me.

 At my job, I&#x27;m in charge of developing a solution to a very disorganized team&#x27;s bottlenecks. 
 One thing I&#x27;ve noted is that they use a Windows share for file storage when their volume is well behind what I feel that&#x27;s meant to handle. They have a root directory with 115k (at present) folders that all have six or seven files a piece. The files are necessary for the cases they&#x27;re working, and the 115k items in their inventory account for 3 months worth of work. The file share will lag for up to a minute before loading on occasion.
 I don&#x27;t have experience in this area, but I&#x27;m certain there has to be a better solution than this.
 What would you recommend?

                              <span>I set up a WAC gateway months back but every time I&#x27;ve tried running it, it constantly asks me for credentials when connecting to machines. I went through a lot of articles and suggestions followed by Microsoft and others but was never able to get it working correctly and ulitmately ended up using a local install of WAC. I&#x27;d like to revisit the gateway so that the IT team can use it as a shared resource but don&#x27;t want to deal with constantly entering credentials every time we try connecting to a machine.

 It&#x27;s just a question that&#x27;s stuck in my mind right now.

                              <span>We have a Mitel on premise installation and we have installed the mobility router. We are having an issue with the app on iOS clients. When the iPhone locks, after a small amount of time, the app loses connection with the mobility router. This calls the incoming calls to ring the native iPhone rather than the Mobility app. We have background refresh enabled on the iPhones, but it does not resolve the issue, any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m comparing Apple Business Essentials vs Mosyle Fuse vs Jamf Essentials, for low budget, 50 device environment.
 Please note will be using Apple Business Manager along side in either case.
 I&#x27;ve already done pricing analysis and feature comparisons.
 No I don&#x27;t want opinions from Jamf Pro users with all the bells and whistles, only Jamf Essentials. I already have Jamf Pro running elsewhere and know its capabilities.
 I now want to hear from hands on admins using one of these three tools.
 What&#x27;s the good bad and ugly?

 Anyone used observium network monitor tool ?
 I already added ASAs and Fortis but want to add servers via SNMPv3, configured same on servers but what should I add into manager portal for the hostname?
 PS : observium host is on cloud and server is located inside a private network behind fortigate/ASA firewall.
 Please help. Thanks

 What safeties did you implement to prevent it? the only I can think now is using filters to exclude those non-compliant devices to be able to login - but that is pretty much manual process for every single device.

                              <span>Hey, I need to deploy a system of microphones in multiple meeting rooms in multiple office locations and be able to store and access all Audio recordings centrally. The mics will be concealed. Suggestions welcome as I don&#x27;t have the remotest idea of how to do this.

                              <span>I work at a small organization where employees are handed managed iMacs to work at home, and my boss would like those computers to remain within the company network for remote access and ensure policy compliance with our in-house software.
 ​
 We have about 30 Macs assigned to employees, with a simple IKEv2 server hosted at our company (hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server), we tried setting an &quot;Always-on VPN&quot; configuration profile to be deployed to our Macs through JAMF, but installing the config (even locally) just pops a generic error message The ‘VPN Service’ payload could not be installed. The VPN service could not be created.
 ​
 IPsec functions correctly, but employees have to manually enable it in settings... Plus, they should not have access to disable it in the first place.... so, has anyone had success with always-on VPNs? if not, how could we remotely access services on our managed devices?

 I correctly set my SSL certificate on the load balancer, but I think the issues comes from my servers, my servers listen on port 80 and I don’t have any SSL certificates on my servers behind the LB.
 But I don’t understand, why the LB doesn’t transfer the SSL certificat to the server farm ? 
 I hope somebody here will take the time to help, feel free to ask questions but I think I give as many details as I can.
 Thanks and good Saturday to all of you.

 I have tried Pfsense which has data quotas, but users can easily circumvent the hard limits by re-logging in to the captive portal. I have also tested Pfsense captive portal with freeradius plugin. But I found that it&#x27;s buggy and running a MySQL server was a hassle. 
 I recently stumbled upon Sophos firewall which seems to have per user data quotas. But many users have reported certain issues related to UI and stability. 
 So, can anyone suggest me a good open source firewall with reliable per user data quotas.

 I have recently added my domain to 365 to use Exchange for my personal email, I have just setup a business basic sub for 1 user so have just the single license with my email address. 
 The email address is me@mydomain.com
 Can I create more shared mailboxes under my 1 license, for example
 Info@mydomain.com Help@mydomain.com
 I wasn’t sure if I needed a license for every mail box I want to create. 
 Appreciate any advice

                              <span>Hi, i need to deploy to our company portal some necessary drivers for some of our devices to be recognized.
 Manually speaking, The driver consists of 4 files that are inside a .cab file, once extracted from the cabinet, the installation involves running cmd as an admin and using pnputil on one of the files to install.
 ​
 How would i go about deploying this to the company portal through intune?
 I tried extracting the .cab on my machine and making a .intunewin file from the directory with the install command utilizing the pnputil command, but it doesnt seem to do anything, the installation fails immediately.
 i also tried making the .intunewin from the .cab itself, also without success
 ​
 any ideas how i should go about this issue?
 a powershell script seems to be the answer, but im not much of a powershell scripter :\
 ​
 ** The whole point of this is that non-admin users could install those drivers without needing to open cmd as admin

                              <span>I’ve been having some thoughts lately about the point I’m at in my career and comparisons with colleagues and friends at various points in their career. One thing I’ve realized with myself is that I’m always too modest about my achievements and efforts. I downplay anything that I’ve done that goes above and beyond and brush off any praise I receive as “just doing my job”. I try too hard to not be the big showboating guy gloating about how many goals I’m kicking and don’t want anything to think that I’m bragging about something. 
 I feel like there’s a difference between being proud of a big achievement and making a huge deal out of something that was really minor. Looking around though I see people that are shameless about claiming credit for something that they both had very little to do with and also really isn’t that important in the grand scheme of things so they get ahead. Is modesty seen as a weakness in career endeavors?

                              <span>As the title states I am looking to setup a TZ270 and an HA model in an active/passive configuration. Where I&#x27;m getting confused at is the switch level. The customer wants to use Unifi Switches, I&#x27;d rather use stackable switches but it is what it is.
 How exactly would I setup 2 Unifi Switches to connect to the Ha firewalls and be completely redundant? Ie either firewall or either switch could die and it still works. https://ibb.co/2dYMPc7
 Am I right in my design or is there a better way given the equipment I&#x27;m dealing with?

                              <span>Hello, I work for a municipal ISP with 10k+ users.
 Occasionally google is unreachable by web browser, ping, traceroute, etc and we are peered with multiple backbones.
 All of are users are affected at the same time and just google related services and websites are affected.
 It seems to be something within our own setup as the peering backbones are not having this issue at all.
 What are best practices for testing and figuring out where the issue may lie?

                              <span>Hello,
 I started a new job and in a process of modernizing my network. The current network is a huge layer2 domain. The customers are in R&amp;D and use a lot of multicast and broadcast. I am planning to turn this network into layer3 since 90% of our traffic is east-west. I am thinking to implement the spine-leaf topology. And utilize vrf-lite for each customer. My network is spread between five different buildings. The farthest building is probably 3000ft away from the main one. Also, the fiber between buildings is either OM1 except for the farthest one.
 It seems like I am going to be using Cisco C9300 and C9500 (or maybe 1u Nexus switch)
  
Can I use C9300 as leaf switches?
 Can I use C9500 for my spines?
  
I am thinking to deploy a couple of leaf switches to each build. I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. My understanding of the spine-leaf network, the vrf-lite exists only at the leaf level. If I have a tenant that happened to be located at two different buildings, the tenant&#x27;s VLANs will be extended via vxlan / l2vpn. Am I right about this? Does the VLAN in bldg A need to match the VLAN ID in bldg B for the same tenant?
 Also, I am still wrapping my head how the routing between tenants. Since each tenant will be placed in a vrf-lite, then I would have to use route-leaking. Do I need to create an ACL on the leaf switches if the traffic between tenants must be restricted based on their applications (e.g. ssh, ftp, etc.) only?
 For my infrastructure, servers (AD, NTP, DNS, DHCP, ISE etc), Docker containers, end-users, and oob (ipmi and network management), should I put these on their own vrf-lite or should I put them on the master/default table? What is the best practice for infrastructure?
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Im trying to put Eve-NG behind npm and have it setup like a normally do which is quick simple. Generated a certificate, pointed it to the IP at port 80 using http and forcing SSL. However when I ge the login screens, I enter my credentials but then nothing happens.
 I had been looking around as someone had an example that works in plain nginx but Im not sure how to incorporate it into npm. I tried adding buffering off in the custom config section but no luck.
 location / { proxy_set_header x-real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header x-forwarded-for $proxy_add_x_forwarded__for; proxy_set_header host $host; proxy_pass https://INTERNALIP:443; proxy_buffering off; } 
 Has anyone already done this before?

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I&#x27;m just curious on what other network engineers thoughts are on ciscos SD wan.
 Specifically, if you&#x27;ve worked with it, have you implemented it, or taken over?
 What components of it do you use?
 What do you like about it?
 In what situation would it be the best bet to deploy and why?
 How much does your org spent on it? What caused them to pay for it?
 The way I see it, the SD WAN full deployment is a super expensive system that completely is maintained by licensing, even though the equipment can technically perform the job already.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>I do networking for a client who is trying to set up a new VOIP service. The VOIP provider said they&#x27;ll require a public IP handoff. The client has an available public IP in their static block. I configured the client firewall to use one of those static IPs and Im trying to think of the best way to set up this handoff. Current set up below:
 Coax &gt; Modem &gt; Ethernet &gt; Router &gt; Ethernet &gt; Firewall. 
 The connection from the ISP router to the firewall is connected to one of the ISP router&#x27;s switch ports. My opinion is its probably best to plug the VOIP provider&#x27;s device needing a public IP directly into one of the other ISP router&#x27;s switch port. It doesn&#x27;t seem practical to try to put the VOIP device behind the firewall because that would need some SNAT config and it needs to be public facing. 
 What do you think? Still green at this so any/all input is appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>We are using a linkrunner AT 1000 to determine what switch ports are connected to. We are finding that on some vlans the test reports a mitel phone as the switch. When this occurs, it is using CDP to discovery the info. 
 We have checked and cdp is off on all switches. We checked and CDP cannot be turned off on the AT 1000. 
 Does any have any recommendations or have you run into this before?

I am not able to assign IP from 192.168.20.0/24 subnet to any device connected to the router 192.168.10.254 Is there any way i can achieve that???
 A little background: We have a DHCP server 192.168.10.221 IP helper route pointing to this DHCP server is on both routers Both subnet have their own scope in DHCP

                              <span>I help maintain a medium sized video production facility that’s equipped with both 16gbs FC and 10gbs copper clients. 
 Often when moving things around I have to troubleshoot connectivity issues on the FC clients by looking for the beam of light in patch panels, HBAs, etc…. This is probably very not good for my eyes which are already not great to deal with. 
 Is there some sort of tool I can get that’ll allow me to plug it into a LC port and confirm signal without having to blind myself? Or am I overthinking the dangers of staring into light??
 Also on the copper side, I’m trying to see if there’s a tool I can plug into a RJ45 port to see if its unpatched, which switch it’s patched to, and if there’s a cable failure somewhere down the line.

                              <span>Hello Community, 
 Full disclaimer: I am not an IT-professional but rather a user seeking advice since the field im in is quite sparse with IT professionals in the &quot;middle-ground&quot; and my go-to IT guy rarely deals with the bandwith/use-cases I work in.
 I do own a small post-production studio (1-3 users) which is currently based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (speaking Cisco SG-X series) connections with Intel/ATTO NICs. I have 3-4 Workstations with 2-3 file-servers and an LTO-Library working in parallel all using 10Gbase. 
 I want/need to upgrade this to fiber to reduce energy-costs and to future-proof the setup and be able reach 25GB speeds (only with some flash/NVME applications/transfers).
 Due to the recent energy costs in europe and the implementation of more network applications (Adder Infinity KVM and Dante audio-networking in my case) I was thinking thinking If I could consolidate the switches and instead run everything in the studio with one (core)switch?
 If that is a terrible idea - let me know. 
 I thought about investing into an FS.Com Switch* like the S5860-48SC, but of course I already read here that people are still sceptic about the software/interface. 
 *(If I recall correctly most switches nowadays are white-labels and every vendor applies their firmware/implementation?)
 Any advice on how to future proof upgrade from 10G is appreciated.
 Since I already run my video on fiber I can easily upgrade the whole facility to fiber step by step since I am due to rewiring anyways. 
 If my post fails to live up to the rules of this subreddit just let me know before deleting.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a small VXLAN/EVPN environment (2 spines, 4 leafs/2 VPC pairs) that was built greenfield with DCNM 11.5(4). I was recently having connectivity issues between DCNM and the switches and to troubleshoot TAC support had me remove one of the leaf switches from DCNM, which then warned me about and removed it&#x27;s VPC partner as well.
 After we resolved the connectivity issue, we attempted to add back in both leaf switches (preserving config) and it&#x27;s throwing this error.
 &quot;Cannot add a Brownfiled switch [serial number] to the fabric unless all existing switches are pending Brownfiled migration.&quot;
 I read this as I need to remove the other 4 switches and try adding them back all in at once as brownfield preserving config.
 Has anyone had to do this or run into this error before? Will the config actually be preserved and not cause any issues? Will I lose all my logged fabric changes since greenfield config or will it pick back up where I left off? Thanks.

                              <span>After searching here and other subs I didn&#x27;t really stumble across a similar enough application. We&#x27;re a small local college looking to provide wifi access to students in some of our parking lots for after hours or pandemic restrictions. We would hang these on the outside second floor of buildings that border the selected parking lots. Our network is all Meraki (switches and inside AP) and can support the outdoor AP with either copper or fiber. Parking lots average about 200&#x27; x 200&#x27; and we can hang up to 3 or 4 AP&#x27;s on most of the buildings facing the lots. So what is suggested for such an application?

                              <span>Hi!
 I have a few Cisco switches on my network and want to add another one but I don&#x27;t do it often so I want to make sure I don&#x27;t mess it up since it&#x27;s been a while. Some kind of an initial setup checklist such as this one would be helpful but it doesn&#x27;t mention anything about VTP so I&#x27;m wondering if there is anything else I&#x27;m missing? The &quot;new&quot; switch was on another network before and I already wiped it (write erase) and deleted the VLAN database (delete flash:vlan.dat). Is there anything else to be done before configuring and then connecting to my network?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering how everyone is handling or seeing datacenter segmentation at your environment or at your customers?
 is there any level of micro segmentation in place?
 How is it being done now or in the past?
 Where are you moving to?
 What are your experiences with it?
  
Just a North-South firewall?
 Is it done VLAN based, terminated on a firewall? 
 Which things do you group together on a VLAN?
 Large security enclaves / zones, for example a VRF sandwiched firewall?
 Anyone using Cisco ACI, just &#x27;network centric&#x27;, or going more to a &#x27;application centric&#x27;/ more segmented approach?
 Anyone using NSX (VLAN backed or overlay)?
 Or using host based firewalling?
  
How do you operate the segmented datacenter? What procedures are in place? What tools do you use?

                              <span>I am working on a project to upgrade some AV infrastructure which is running on Cisco SG500 (for video over IP) and Cisco SG300 (control, DANTE, general data etc). As these are discontinued, I am looking to move to the CBS350 range to keep things relatively consistent.
 In Australia, these are all basically non-existent for at least 52+ weeks. However, I have found the exact same models (albeit an NA model vs AU model) on US sites, in stock and available to ship.
 Apart from obvious conundrums around support should something go wrong or become faulty, is there any reason a USA version of a Cisco product would not work in Australia? All the switches I&#x27;m interested in have world PSU&#x27;s, so that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.

 No current documentation is a available, people don&#x27;t necessarily know where all of the network equipment is, there might be undocumented/rogue gear, and there might be orphaned VPN links to third parties that people have forgotten about. There is no current network engineer to ask, the last one died/retired/wandered off.
 Once I identify all active, reachable networks then I can sort and document them, create a list of points of contact and so on. Then for mystery networks start to dig, probe and eliminate.

                              <span>In case this is a XY problem: Is there a way to access routers via TR-069 that are behind another NAT?
 Hi,
 We have some places whereby we are alloted a single private IP inside of that company and we manage the networking infrastructure (IPS, switches, APs, etc.) under a double NAT situation, where our first gateway router is behind a NAT.
 Without an open port to the public facing internet, is there a way to still use TR-069 for our gateway device?
 -----------------------------------
 Essentially, this is what I want:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069#Connection_request_over_NAT
 I&#x27;ve been researching how to use STUN for a few days now with no breakthrough, from my research it seems possible, and that I need to utiltise the same UDP port when traffic is coming back to the CPE equipment to do so. I&#x27;m open to exploring other open source ACS servers as well that has an easier implementation for NAT traversal via STUN or XMPP.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Ok so I&#x27;m struggling to search for the right terms so I&#x27;ve decided to try and ask.
 If you have a fibre run, and you connect two switches with 1Gbps transceivers, you get 1Gbps link. Yay.
 I&#x27;m trying to determine if &quot;old&quot; fibre is perfectly fine if it still works. You either get a 1Gbps connection or you don&#x27;t - or - signal degradation and packet loss could mean a functional connection with a seriously low maximum capability even though the link is established at 1Gbps.
 What happens over time? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? Does the capability of the medium degrade and lose performance? Do you get &quot;indicated&quot; 1Gbps right up until the point where you get no link? Do you get indicated 1Gbps but no where near the 1Gbps throughput and packet loss? 
 It&#x27;s been quite hard to search for the answer, and I think I&#x27;m just using the wrong search terms, or this isn&#x27;t widely discussed.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Our org is 100% Cloud - all in on O365. We use SharePoint for file management and many of our staff use the onedrive app to sync folders to their pc&#x27;s. Twice this year (so far), users have deleted massive folders/files (10-50k files) because they wanted to get rid of the sync&#x27;d folder on their pc - when they should have simply stopped the sync in the onedrive app.
 As you can imagine, doing massive restores from the recycle bin is extremely time consuming and it&#x27;s tricky restoring from our cloud backup provider as it&#x27;s usually not the entire site that is deleted.
 I was hoping MS had a policy we could set to stop bulk deletions (max deletions at a time &#x3D; 20 or something along those lines), but from what i read and what MS support tells me, the only way to stop these deletion is to remove &#x27;delete&#x27; permissions from all of our permissions, except for a select few staff. This also appears to disable renames as well.
 Is that truly the only way to stop this from occurring? Are there any O365 SharePoint settings to stop deletions in general? 
 Thanks for your input!

 I have nothing against SANs, nor do I have anything against Gluster or Ceph. I just wanna know why would one be chosen over the other, hopefully with an example.

I am shocked to see 1-200 applicants on every job listing and starting to get very discouraged. I hold multiple cloud certs too and I am barely getting any responses back. Seems like 3 months ago recruiters were bothering me non stop. I was even told 2 days ago for an IT sec analyst/IAM role for 80/k a year (local company too) that I am OVERQUALIFIED as a sys admin. What the hell man…I hope it’s better by January because this is super discouraging. Rant over :(

                              <span>10 years ago i ran our server team, and retired our last 2003 server. it had lived a long life because it ran our ticketing system, and even after it was replaced, there were links back to it at the database level for some fixed asset information that the new system did not directly support, so the app devs wrote a little tool to get data from there for &quot;this last year we need that before we setup our new web replacement&quot;. during my time with it (7 years) it went from physical to virtual as well. it had a long life.
 i moved on to back end app support, new people took over servers, devs finished their replacement in 2 years instead of less than 3 months and the server can be turned off right? sure. 
 then there were some VM host issues, some data storage problems, VMware helped the new server team recover everything, and the server re-appears. as i am recovering some of the systems i support, i notice the name and let them know, they delete it again. 
 forward 2 years, some update fails, working with VMware again to fix things, pops back into existence. I notice it... again. 
 more issues.... reappears...
 again..
 today is the 7th time in 10 years i have seen this fucking server that wont die. 
 I think its taunting me. oh, and my co-workers are incompetent.

                              <span>I’ve been lurking this sub for about a year after changing careers from a criminal justice related field. I went from essentially a shitty ISP data entry job, to desktop support, to a “do everything” MSP engineer position in that time.
 I have to shout out all of the helpful IT professionals in this sub, I’ve learned a lot just reading posts, comments, and checking out links that you all share - it’s been immensely helpful!
 From what my new manager tells me, the ticket queue for escalations from help desk is usually empty, projects are the bulk of the work, and I’ll be owning a handful of systems and network components.
 I can’t wait for less end user support, more technical work, and better pay. I’m nervous as hell but excited to get started!
 Thanks again to the community here, may I soon be a salty sysadmin doling out wisdom in between applying patches and cursing vendors.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve managed my organization&#x27;s Adobe licensing for over 3 years now, and I can&#x27;t express enough how much I fucking loathe dealing with this company.
 Every single renewal has been plagued by licensing issues, and Adobe employees know fuck all about their own software. If I&#x27;m instructed to log out and back into an Adobe ID as a resolution one more time, I swear to fuck something is getting burnt down. Issues are inconsistent; some users can use the entire suite, others none of it, a few can use everything besides Acrobat. Even worse, my licensing provider will tell me something is included (such as Adobe Sign) and Adobe tells me that it isn&#x27;t.
 So that leaves me, stuck in the middle, screaming like an absolute Karen, &quot;We paid for licensing, fucking fix it!&quot; I feel as if I&#x27;m screaming into the void, with no solution in sight, all the while staff can&#x27;t perform their duties from lack of access.
 Has anyone experienced similar issues with this shit-show of a company or has any suggestions? Neither Adobe or my licensing provider has been able to provide a fix in over a month, and I&#x27;m at wits end.
 Edit: So fun fact, Adobe Sign doesn&#x27;t come with Creative Cloud K-12 Shared Device licensing, so if an Adobe employee tells you otherwise, you call them a damn dirty liar. It took A MONTH for Adobe to figure that out. Guess we can&#x27;t even expect them to do sales correctly either.

                              <span>This just happened yesterday and it&#x27;s still bothering me. I&#x27;m the one who is responsible for responding to security incidents and I&#x27;m accountable in a lot of ways for keeping the doors shut tight. When someone goes wrong, I&#x27;m the person they ask to fix it, I&#x27;m the one giving updates, and I&#x27;m the one suggesting and implementing changes when it&#x27;s over.
 VIPs made a last minute request to install a VPN onto their personal devices ASAP. I questioned this and was told it&#x27;s fine, but it isn&#x27;t sitting well with me. I&#x27;m thinking about bringing it up a level because if a user did this I&#x27;d be pissed.
 I suggested consumer VPNs and reminded my manager that we know nothing about these devices, have not given any instructions on the use of the VPN, and this will expose our secure network which in all other circumstances we are very protective of. 
 Usually this manager can see reason, I&#x27;m not really getting this. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m talking to an end user. One of the VIPs doesn&#x27;t even work in our company, it&#x27;s a friend.
 I&#x27;m just doing it, but we go through so much effort to keep our network secure, jumping through hoops and implementing rigorous compliance standards, rolling out lengthily policies and reworking our internal processes to avoid creating gaps like this, only for what... some VIPs want to go on vacation and can&#x27;t pay $10 for a month of Mozilla VPN.

                              <span>I work with a lot of developers, and many are *terrible* at installing instructions in documentation. They skip steps, put in wrong steps, or their install process is outdated.
  
Go to website foo and download foo.app.gz [link is broken] &quot;Oh, yeah, it&#x27;s a git download.&quot; [git link doesn&#x27;t work] &quot;Try this other link.&quot;
 Unzip foo.app.gz, go into the &quot;install&quot; directory, and run &quot;setup.sh&quot; [there is no &quot;install directory&quot; nor is there a &quot;setup.sh&quot;]
 &quot;Oh yeah, run &#x27;configure&#x27; then &#x27;make all&#x27;.&quot; &quot;There is no makefile.&quot; &quot;You have to download that separately on another website, I forget where.&quot; &quot;Okay, that&#x27;s pretty vital.&quot; &quot;Ask Dan.&quot;
 &quot;Did Jim tell you to run configure? No no, run &#x27;setup.sh&#x27; and ... there is no setup? When did they remove that?&quot; &quot;Who is &#x27;they&#x27;, here?&quot; &quot;Let me see what&#x27;s going on, share your screen.... oh, I have never seen THAT before. Did you run brew bar-app-libs?&quot; &quot;This is a Linux box, not a Mac.&quot; &quot;Okay, well, there is a Homebrew for linux, so get that...&quot;
 &quot;I know that Jenkins said every build has failed, but ignore that, and download this weird obscure package manager...&quot;
  
And so on. I remember one developer was so mad his docker build didn&#x27;t work, he said, &quot;I thought you said you knew Linux?&quot; and I wanted to punch him. He couldn&#x27;t get it to work, either, and blamed my environment. And after I looked at his dockerfile, there was no way it would have worked; even the syntax was wrong.

                              <span>Hi All! 
 How do you keep your AD user employee details up do date? 
 All the employee metadata in the user account like Job Title, Department, Company, Manager name, phone numbers, address etc. might be superfluous in a basic org but become more useful when AD SSO is integrated with other enterprise systems such as Helpdesk that can leverage this info for approvals or hardware provisioning, etc. 
 So how do you do keep track of the constant changes to job titles, employee relocations, etc. Is IT normally burdened with this? We are considering offloading this task to HR as this seems more within their realm of responsibility, but we are unsure what the best way to go about it is. Do you provide direct AD access to those non-IT users? Do you use third party software? Also, what permissions are used? 
 -Thanks!

                              <span>A year ago I moved to a new role, I was being hired by a Director of IT who only just got hired himself. The company was a resturant and retail chain with 3500 employees and 80 stores. Not exactly small.
 Yet they had no IT. No MSP to support them. No &quot;I used to be an IT manager&quot; people. Nothing.
 It honestly astounded me that they lasted this long without burning to the ground. But the longer I&#x27;ve been here, the more I&#x27;ve come to realize that it&#x27;s because they went with such a simple technology stack that they could get away with it. Here&#x27;s a few things they did:
  
Google workspace 
 Everything was in Google, all files stored in drive, all documents and emails are Google. Most people just intuitively understand Google because they probably have a Gmail already. No dealing with clunky Mic…</span>

 We were recently the target of a man in the middle attack that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft&#x27;s OTP feature for SharePoint.
 One of our users received an email from a breached account at another company with what looked like a link to a file. The link took the user to a page asking for their email address then after entering the email it took them to a page asking for a one time passcode. The passcode showed up in their email and they entered it. This allowed the attacker to bypass both their password and multifactor on their account.
 The first page asking for their email address was spoofed and set up to have Microsoft send a OTP to the user. The second page then sent the OTP to the attacker so they…</span>

                              <span>Say you have a couple piece of software with a VAR that require yearly renewals. You get the quote and pay online through their portal. How long do you typically expect to wait until you receive the new licenses?
 We have a couple renewals with a large VAR. I know we are small beans to them. But, we are talking over a week to get the renewal keys and they ghost us in the meantime. Currently, I&#x27;ve contacted them 3 times via e-mail to check on the status and absolutely no response, but they have charged us. Not sure if I&#x27;m being unreasonable or not.

                              <span>Hello, 
 iam new hear. Yes, also as a IT Sys Admin Junior Possition. Ill get to the Point right away: We manually extend the Size of our Mailboxes (Exchange) from our users (around 1000) , everytime they send us a ticket and we extend it 20% . I wonder is there a chance to create a PS String Skript, which will check automaticly all users - lets say every week - check the mailboxes , and when the mailbox is at 80% of the size it will extend the mailboxsize 20% 
 maybe there is already a solution for this, but i cant find it. 
 ​
 cheers

 I&#x27;ve got postfix installed on Ubuntu 22.04 and I&#x27;m running into issues where I think I can pin it down to the myhostname as being the issue. If I set it to local host I get a 421 error and if I set it to my fqdn I get a bounce unknown user.
 I&#x27;m clearly missing something, just don&#x27;t know what it is.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have an question.
 We are starting a new application from a 3th party Supplier and need some basic information from you guys.
 Since all those new machines will be pushed with WDS+ workbench and joint in our AutoPilot section. There still some things WDS+ autopilot cannot do.
 And therefore my opinion is to use GPO&#x27;s.
 We have 2 Domain controllers (second one is for backup) 1 Wsus server 1 file server (locally) + veaam backup enabled ** On the Fileserver WDS+workbench
 So that specific application needs to have an folder (user based, not Computer based) 
 So we created a folder with the content of the requested software in it. It is shared now. And now it needs to take that folder and copy it to the user profile of the machine.
 How to setup this 
 Is this possible? I think it is, but now knowing for sure. The 3th party group provided us the installation document. But the part for copy folder to user via wds+workbench is not in there, for them it is copy paste.

                              <span>We have a single VM running RDS called (imaginatively) RDS.
 People just use the Windows RDP client to connect directly to RDS.
 Will I need to do anything when the October patch is installed?
 I&#x27;ve read several articles on this and I&#x27;m still not clear whether I need to do anything or not.

                              <span>I am trying to work out how we can have multiple tenants that are accessible by individual tenant administrator accounts. The documentation and web interface don&#x27;t specify how a user logging in can specify the tenant they want to administer. I have Active Directory SSO working, so our tenant administrators get logged in automatically to the first tenant I created. However, if I create additional tenants and want certain users to have access to these in addition to our primary tenant, how do I grant access and have a way for the user to choose the tenant they login to? I see no way to grant permissions to the tenants to say which accounts have access, and if I try and use the same username on different tenants, it fails and says the user already exists.
 I think I may be fundamentally missing some crucial information on how this works.

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;re acquiring and opening offices at a fast pace around Europe and the current vendor we have for Computers and peripherals can&#x27;t really keep up. Is there any provider who can deliver to most of Europe (including non-eu countries such as UK and Norway) while still being able to autopilot and DEP computers?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Admins,
 I am trying to use a PowerShell script for enabling and enforcing MFA for users in O365. The issue I&#x27;m having isn&#x27;t with the script itself, it is when I try to automatically run the PowerShell. I get the authentication popup looking for credentials. I&#x27;ve found some articles that&#x27;ll let you put your username and password into the script so you don&#x27;t need to authenticate before running the script. The password is in plain text which I&#x27;m not good with. Is there a way to connect to O365 and run a PowerShell script without having to manually run it and authenticate? Also, my understanding on Microsoft Graph is limited at the moment, but I suspect there maybe a way to use Graph for this?

Nothing like encouraging companies to upgrade to more modern methods in the tenant by removing the tools to upgrade them.

I assume it is spammers just doing drive-by &quot;Free trials&quot; on Azure servers, sending a bunch of spam until they get shut off -- rinse, lather, repeat. This has been going on for about a year or so. Maybe it&#x27;s time some of the major email providers (Gmail, etc) make some serious threats to just block the whole damn thing, unless Microsoft takes some corrective action to prevent this crap.
 If I try to report it using MIcrosoft&#x27;s CERT abuse reporting website, I receive the same exactly worded automated email in response to the submission, and then always exactly one hour later they send another (automated) email saying that the issue has been resolved.
 This is a huge joke.

                              <span>What do you all use to manage your laptops? We currently do it a kinda old school where we have everyone connect to a VPN (not everyone connects they fall off the domain all the time) and have a patch management software patch them, and another software to remote in and troubleshoot issues. We&#x27;re looking for something like an always on vpn and also somthing that will manage laptop patches, software updates, installations, etc..almost like n MDM but for laptops.. I keep hearing the word zero trust network but haven&#x27;t got into any of that yet.

 Share away what yall got going on? Quick note my environment is about 375 laptops.

                              <span>I have a client using Windows 2019. For the life of me, I cannot figure this out. The client is getting random RDP disconnects. Their connections will just crash and drop.
 Things ive noticed:
 Sometimes they DO run out of RDP cals from the RDP license server but from my understanding this should NOT drop their connection. Did this change in 2019?
 Windows event viewer is useless. There are no error codes that warrant any problems. Maybe I am looking at the wrong one? Thank you

                              <span>Hello, so I&#x27;m having an issue with Outlook where a client that has Exchange on-premises keeps trying to connect to Exchange Online and asks for a Microsoft login. If I close the Microsoft login prompt it works for a while then disconnects and asks the Microsoft login again...
 The Exchange autodiscover is correct and only pointing to itself but if I use Outlook&#x27;s Automatic configuration tester it immediately asks me for a Microsoft login, then if I close that it correctly asks for the domain credentials and once I provide that it gets the correct on-premises autodiscover information.
 The only detail I can think of is that we have a 365 tenant with some of the same email accounts as on-premises but it&#x27;s only for Microsoft Teams, Exchange online is not configured anywhere at all, it&#x27;s not even licenced.
 I&#x27;ve tried adding the autodiscover xml to the Outlook registry but it makes no difference, it&#x27;s like it always phones home to Outlook before trying the actual email server domain.
 Has anyone had this issue before?

                              <span>Happy Friday Sysadmins! Do you have any plans this weekend? If not, I might have something you can sink your teeth into... Number Matching in MS Authenticator. 
 It&#x27;s a feature which essentially rather than prompt a user for a &quot;yes/no&quot; &quot;approve/deny&quot; response on their phone, asks a user to enter a number into a prompt box. This effectively blocks an attacker from flooding their phone with MFA requests, fatiguing them into accepting, thinking it&#x27;s something they&#x27;ve done wrong; because the user will never see the number and the attacker will instantly know that attack won&#x27;t work.
 This feature went GA last week but some of you may have had it in preview for the last couple of months, it&#x27;s pretty solid and I thoroughly recommend it. From a users perspective, it&#x27;s no more effort than an old school SMS code, and a tiny bit more than hitting &quot;approve&quot;
 The only thing I dislike about it from a users perspective, is that I can no longer simply hit &quot;approve&quot; from my Apple watch.. so be mindful of that with your execs and managers, I guess..?
 My video talking about it, demoing it and showing you where the settings are in Azure AD can be found here:
 https://youtu.be/cjsViEclw1I
 Apologies for the croaky voice, I&#x27;m unwell but wanted to get my weekly video out there and keep up with helping the small community of followers I&#x27;ve been working with for the past couple of months.
 If anyone wants any help with this, hit me up!

                              <span>Hey,
 I have a Ceph cluster (3 nodes) which I want to mount on 3 different VMs. Here are some questions:
  
I guess that I need a layer &quot;between&quot; Ceph and the OS/kernel? How can I basically do it, as each Ceph node has a different IP and I really don&#x27;t want to add yet another layer of HaProxy or KeepAlived+Floating IP.
 What happens if two VMs want to write into the same file at the same time? Does Ceph have any kind of locking mechanism that prevents the file to be &quot;double-write&quot;?
  
Thanks!

                              <span>Sysadmin working for a pharma manufacturing company in a small 3 employees IT team. Our production has been adding some IoT devices connected directly to prod machines for some years. These devices needs outgoing internet traffic with some Azure/DNS/NTP servers. The way I handled it is I whitelisted the needed IP on the firewall.
 But as time goes, it gets complicated to manage these firewall WAN IP whitelisting, and I&#x27;m wondering if it is worth it. 
 In résumé, is it overkill to use Wan ip whitelisting for security purpose if iot device is initiating the internet traffic?

 Sample 1 which is a standard .html file is as expected - sample1.html
 Sample 2 which is the malicious JS obfuscated page which slipped through a filter contains .htm and then .pdf so the file properties displays this as .htm - malware mth.pdf
 This should have been caught by our filter but the double extension has caused it to not be picked up. I was trying to replicate this but I was having mixed results. I first tried copying the file name as its written with mth.pdf and it changed to a PDF. I then tried playing with the RTLO but this is pretty much patched by most browsers.
 Does anyone know how this was achieved?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 it has been a long time since I last used group policies to administer servers or other computers. Right now we have a terminal server which everyone logs into and uses. I want to prevent certain users from turning off the server by applying the specific group policy rule. From my memory, I think I did the right steps but just now I tested it and it didnt work. I did the following steps:
  
Move Terminal Server to OU &#x27;Servers&#x27;
 Link GPO to &#x27;Servers&#x27; with User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar &gt; Remove and Prevent Access to the shutdown command activated. 
 Link another GPO to &#x27;Servers&#x27; with Computer Configuration\ Administrative Templates\ System\ Group Policy\Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode activated.
 Set security group for both only allowing the Standard-User Group to apply the policy.
 gpupdate on terminal server
  
What I expect to happen is the machine reading the loopback policy on startup, however I&#x27;m not sure if I just prevented that using a security-group. Do I need to include the machine itself inside the security group? How is it different than using &quot;authenticated users&quot;. 
 After reading the loopback policy, the Server tries to read the user config policy but ignores it, because it is not a user. Now when a user logs into the machine, although not being inside the OU, the user reads the user configuration from the policy because loopback is applied and applies the policy, when the user is a member of the security group. 
 I&#x27;m certain I made a mistake somewhere because otherwise it would work. 
 ​
 Thanks for any help

                              <span>I have SQL 2019 STD RDS that is not domain joined and it&#x27;s only accessible inside VPC (no public IP). I have an internal AD domain and several web servers joined to that internal AD inside VPC. MDTC is configured to with no auth on those EC2 instance and also on RDS. When I try distributed transaction initiated from the web app (on the EC2 instance) I get following error:
 &quot;The MSDTC transaction manager was unable to pull the transaction from the source transaction manager due to communication problems. Possible causes are: a firewall is present and it doesn&#x27;t have an exception for the MSDTC process, the two machines cannot find each other by their NetBIOS names, or the support for network transactions is not enabled for one of the two transaction managers. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D02B)&quot; 
 DNS resolution should be working on that RDS, I can&#x27;t check since xp_cmd_shell can&#x27;t be enabled to try it out so RDS should resolve EC2 instances, DNS servers are set on VPC DHCP settings. Security rules are currently to allow everything while I am troubleshooting. I did everything like I usually do without RDS
 RDS option group settings
 ENABLE_SNA_LU true ALLOW_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ALLOW_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ENABLE_XA true TRANSACTION_LOG_SIZE 4 AUTHENTICATION NONE 
 The only question left here is, do I need active directory joined RDS for this to work (and ofc all servers joined to that same AD)? From all the docs and videos available this should work, but didn&#x27;t find info anywhere is being part of AD hard prereq or not.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 We are using Microsoft 365 E5 our data is still on the on-premise fileserver, we use Exchange Online for email.
 I&#x27;ve been asked to come up with a solution for the following &quot;problem&quot;. 
 The company wants to do some compliance checks on outgoing email, but only on some pre-defined checks;
 - More than 10 external recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - More than 50 internal recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - Attachments with information such as addresses or financial data to external recipients. 
 With the &#x27;checks&#x27; above, there need to be some actions configured;
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message &quot;Are you sure you want to sent this message&quot; if &#x27;yes&#x27; then send.
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message &quot;Message blocked due to high amount of external recipients&quot;.
 - Block message (sent to manager for approval)
 - Block message with message &quot;Contact IT for additional support&quot; 
 I&#x27;ve been digging around and could not come up with a solution for this.
 Only things i could find where;
 - Limit the total recicpients per message
 - Limit the total recipients you can mail to per hour/day
 - Sent all external mail for approval to a manager 
 Does anyone knows a possible solution for this within the Microsoft e5 suite? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there, we have a remote work site location where the 4G isn&#x27;t great, and we&#x27;ve also installed Starlink. I want to move our operations onto Starlink full-time, but I am worried about losing connection at critical times due to some trees in the area. What would be an uncomplicated way to monitor Starlink&#x27;s uptime? I&#x27;ve got a few win10 boxes down there so could leave one running 24/7 to monitor.

From what I was reading earlier, it&#x27;s possible to integrate FreeIPA with AD and use FreeIPA to manage the Linux systems. But my questions are:
 Did I misunderstand what I read?
 If it is true that I can do that, why would I? Doesn&#x27;t it make more sense to just use AD directly?

 We have phone servers CUCM, CUCP and CER on private non-routable private addresses. Now this used to work fine but now with Smart Licensing and Apple Push services for Jabber, we have been using Squid as a proxy server to get out. Is there a better solution, should we instead convert to a NATTED network? thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys, RF tech here.
 I work for a company that services public safety radio systems, dispatch consoles, and the networks they are linked through. The company I work for requires us to be on an on-call rotation, 24x7 every 2 weeks (this figure depends on the number of competent techs). 
 We get paid a fixed standby amount for the week on-call of $100, with automatic time and a half when responding after hours. For municipalities on maintenance agreements, our time starts from port to port (company provided car). Phone walkthroughs are not paid. For customers not on a maintenance agreement, it’s a minimum 4 hours paid, but this is rare.
 The industry I’m in is small, and there isn’t much of a baseline for typical on-call standby compensation and minimum hour paid, so I’m turning to you guys to get an idea for an average in a somewhat related field. 
 Forgive me if this is not allowed, there isn’t much of a community of RF techs online. Please remove if not within the scope of the community.

 Right now they are obviously failing SPF and DKIM alignment because their return-path and DKIM signature domain don&#x27;t match our domain.
 What&#x27;s the approach to get DMARC compliance working in this case? I&#x27;m assuming a custom return-path?

                              <span>I know I can set the dmarc to p&#x3D;quarantine or p&#x3D;reject, but we aren&#x27;t having an issue with email being sent to other organizations, so I&#x27;d like to avoid that.
 However, I&#x27;d like to block emails from outside the permitted servers from spoofing their domain to try and phish internal users. 
 I&#x27;m surprised this filter isn&#x27;t automatically setup but we have run into this issue a few times (fortunately nobody falling for them), so I&#x27;d like to prevent these emails from ending up in user&#x27;s inboxes. 
 Any assistance on how to setup a filter like this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

 They are being very evasive and will not name even one specific affected site by name.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious to know what others &quot;do&quot;, when a client complains that their computer is slow. Our first response is to see if its the entire computer, or the Line of Business app. Depending on which one it is, we do different things.
 So my question to you all, what&#x27;s on your list for a slow computer (generally speaking)?

 It was based in Virginia, and when he arrived they were housing 10 H1B workers to a house, with sleeping bags, and they spent their days learning to talk about their entirely fabricated resumes, they would have a professional interview via webcam for you to get hired, then blackmail the workers for up to 70% of their salary, which for immigrants was still more money then they’d ever seen.
 They use the stereotype of Indians being good with tech but the reality is, Indians are helping their own get into American companies by any means necessary to escape poverty in India.

                              <span>a bit of a rant because I was just floored after having a conversation with an engineering team regarding a new software we will be using (that of course we weren&#x27;t consulted on until the ink dried).
 An accounting and tax software, whose engineering teams states they have national clients when asked how large some of the companies are that use their software, informed me that their software does not have any method for mass deployment.
 They do not offer any method of command line to install it. The exe (which i used USSF from that post a few days ago) does not have any hidden flags. It appears that it is simply an exe that when launched, extracts the files.
 So I am off to figure out where it puts its extracted files and go from there on how to install this.
 I don&#x27;t normally rant, but when they told me they don&#x27;t have any method of mass deployment and to use a tool like SCCM, I was astounded. We use other tools, but they don&#x27;t support installers that offer no command line install options...

                              <span>This was just a weird situation all around, and I just needed to rant about it for a bit. This happened about 2 weeks ago.
 In the middle of the IT department, there is a table with our primary printer. One day, randomly, there were cupcakes and a bag with a brand name on it (the bag also contained 2 handwritten cards directed to our director and CIO). I asked around, no one knew where they came from. My coworkers started eating the cupcakes, but I didn&#x27;t because I had a bad feeling about them. You need a key fob to get into our building, we had never heard of the brand before, and no one saw the person who dropped them off.
 Fast forward a couple of hours. I&#x27;m in the restroom and so is the building&#x27;s receptionist. &quot;How did you guys like your cupcakes?&quot; she asked. I looked at her, confused, and asked what she knew about them.
 &quot;Well, a guy came in and said they were for the IT department. I couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anyone, so I just sent him back.&quot; Awkwardly, I told her none of us saw him and none of us knew who he was, either.
 &quot;Oh.&quot;
 Getting back to my desk, I tell my coworkers what I had learned. Some random vendor we&#x27;ve never dealt with before personally delivered cupcakes. Whatever, vendor wants you to buy their products. What upset me more is that our receptionist just let a random person into the building for really no reason. We&#x27;re not government or anything like that, but why have key fobs for the doors if our receptionist is going to let just about anyone in?
 Apparently I was the only one freaked out by that - everyone else had a cupcake. Luckily, they were just regular cupcakes, but still. That did NOT sit well with me.
 Rant over.

 Scramble to figure out if it’s the modem or firewall.
 Call spectrum and reset the modem.
 Reset the firewall.
 Power cycle switch.
 Test a direct connect from modem to laptop, works.
 Thinking it’s not working because we’re not connected to the spectrum router.
 Call backup.
 Asked if I checked the server because DNS resolves from there.
 Turn on server, internet is back up.
 It’s not DNS
 There’s no way it’s DNS
 It was DNS
 Definitely felt stupid.

                              <span>Folks, I know it&#x27;s engraved in all of us to have backups, safety recovery measures, etc in case of device failures
 That does Not mean your partner/significant others have it, even if it&#x27;s been almost a decade together.
 I spent most of yesterday recovering data from my wife&#x27;s failed phone because &quot;the backup notifications from Google were annoying so I turned them off&quot; 
 The notification? Her nightly backups were failing because she changed her password. 
 Date of last backup? 3 months ago....
 Folks, don&#x27;t make my mistake

                              <span>I feel like all I do anymore is argue with vendors and their lack luster support. I&#x27;m sick of having sales tell me one thing and then when it comes to implementation I get a totally different story. Working in the financial services sector it&#x27;s all vendors do anymore, they lie and they lie and they lie. I want to build systems and solutions not have legal battles with a bunch of liars. I&#x27;m to the point that I&#x27;m going to start recording sales calls because I don&#x27;t know what else to do. People are going to say, &quot;make sure it&#x27;s in the contract&quot;, and I do to the best of my ability when its a vendor I picked, but I&#x27;m also not a lawyer, I&#x27;m a sysadmin. Not to mention jumping ship from vendor to vendor can be more disruptive than just dealing with it or figuring out a manual solution for things. This job isn&#x27;t fun anymore and frankly it sucks. OK, I&#x27;ve said what I wanted to say, thanks for listening. If you want to call out any liars in the comments feel free.

                              <span>Good morning admins. I&#x27;m new to the sub and still a bit new into this role. I hope you could enlighten me on a question I have. 
 Our business will be changing our network infrastructure a bit and moving to sdwan. Our new network provider was doing a kick off meeting and asked about hand off type for our offices. A few of our offices use electrical rj45 but I was tasked to confirm what the remaining offices use. A side note, one of our offices we have yet to move into and does not have any of our equipment at this time. 
 I am still growing into this position and am not sure how to determine what hand off is being used. How would I be able to determine this? Thank you for any assistance.

                              <span>A steel company that we recently acquired has complaints about poor Wi-Fi in the shop. One of their issues is that all of their APs are end of life. So I’m replacing all of it with unifi gear. 
 But I also wonder how much the environment is affecting performance. A few things I’m thinking about - interference from welding machines, microscopic pieces of steel in the air causing signal issues, giant pieces of steel everywhere reflecting Wi-Fi signal, steel dusting settling on the APs making a faraday cage kind of thing.
 Anyone have advice for this kind of environment? Am I being overly cautious? Anything else to consider?

                              <span>Howdy everyone!
 Hoping someone can clear this up for me. I&#x27;ve got a vulnerability warning in the Defender portal showing that 27 of my devices have OpenSSL installed and need to be updated. The part that&#x27;s confusing me here is that I can find no trace of OpenSSL installed on these systems. The only place that it shows as installed is in the Defender portal. There&#x27;s no trace of it in the Windows Registry, nothing in the system path, no services running, nothing in the installed apps list, etc. But Defender is going as far as pulling in different version numbers from somewhere. 
 Any ideas on what&#x27;s happening here? This is only showing on about half of my devices. All have been deployed through Intune. We don&#x27;t do any sort of custom certificate management and I&#x27;ve sure never set up OpenSSL to be deployed, so I&#x27;m not sure where it&#x27;s coming from as it isn&#x27;t very consistent. Some of these devices were deployed months ago, one was freshly ran through autopilot earlier this week. 
 Much thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction here.

                              <span>I am trying to remotely add a computer to domain using powershell:
 Add-Computer -ComputerName $computer -LocalCredential $credential -DomainName $DOMAIN -Credential $ad_credential -Restart 
 This is giving me an error:
  
Add-Computer : Cannot establish the WMI connection to the computer &#x27;comuter&#x27; with the following error message: The RPC server is unavailable. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800706BA).
  
When I stop the firewall on the remote computer and run the add-computer command again, it works, so it seems windows firewall is blocking something.
 Does anyone know what specifically I need to enable/allow on the firewall to allow this remote management?
 The reason I ask is that I am automating the entire VM build process, so manually RDPing to the machine after it is created to stop firewall, then re-running the join domain command is not the solution I am looking for. I need to know what on the firewall I need to open so that I can automate it.

                              <span>We&#x27;re a smaller company and typically on any sort of projects or anything members of different departments will work together on something. How do you guys handle the sharing of that data between departments? We&#x27;re looking at changing our File Server structure in the future and plan on using ABE and having department folders and user folders in the root and pretty much that being it. I&#x27;ve thought of a general share folder that gets cleaned out either daily or weekly but wanted some thoughts on it.

                              <span>We have a server running a fully updated Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. 
 18.04 LTS will soon enter &quot;Extended Security Maintenance (ESM)&quot;.
 What does this mean compared to the normal &quot;Hardware and maintenance updates&quot; phase?
 Security-wise and only considering the OS, is 18.04 then as secure as 22.04 LTS? Meaning they get the same security updates as long as they are supported?
 My understanding is that 22.04 LTS comes with newer versions of all packages compared to 18.04 LTS. Doesn&#x27;t this mean that 22.04 LTS is better security-wise than 18.04 LTS?
 What I am basically aiming at is whether upgrading 18.04 LTS to 22.04 LTS is worth the risk compared to the benefits (benefits being mostly higher security due to fixed vulnerabilities?)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m not a Linux specialist and I have a linux-server with apache 2.4.38 in my environment. Now the question is, how do I identify which version of Apache is vulnerable? I didn&#x27;t find anything on apache.org about the library which should be included in this version.
 I read, that there should be a library with the name &quot; Apache Commons Text versions 1.5 through 1.9. &quot;, which is vulnerable. But how do I find this library on the system? Is this even possible?
 ​
 thank you for any support.
 ​
 edit: I found the library ( Commons Text – Download Apache Commons Text ). Can I just install it on the Linux machine? or should I update the whole apache? How can I identify that it isn&#x27;t vulnerable anymore?

                              <span>Ugh, Glad I am so out of that world of IT Support and Infrastructure. Was waiting in a hospital this week and I overheard a few things that made my skin crawl and that’s not what I was in for ha-ha
 So, one person asked another, how do I get this document from one system to another. The answer from a colleague was “Print it, scan it and email it to yourself” 
 How broken is the system in place where there is that level of inefficiency. 
 Then an NHS IT worker came round and said to them at reception that they need to take the system down to replace a broken cable over the weekend so they were going round and putting wireless dongles into the computers….
 He was then asked about sending email, one person said that I would have a few different windows open at a time so you can queue your email as emails took about 5 minutes to arrive....sigh

                              <span>hired by new firm, tasked with finding helpdesk replacement
 develop needs matrix, research (good lord there are a lot of players in this space)
 month of wading through demos and suffering sales calls, boiled down to 2 (happyfox and freshservice)
 Time to demo both and get UAT testing going, have demo environments up and running in both contenders, duplicating our existing categories and subcategories was quick, made a demo auto-responder and an auto-dispatch example in both.
 Day of demos, director says need to explain why Jira isn&#x27;t going to work for us, as it is in other parts of the org and standardization...blah blah blah.
 I had already demoed and failed Jira Service Management as not a good fit for our team, only 4 of us, way overkill, ugly UI, hard to develop, etc.
 Still need to explain why Jira isn&#x27;t going to work for us.
 Other than putting JSM up against the other two in UAT environments and letting JSM dig it&#x27;s own grave, I need some more ammo.
 help?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We were recently discussing the Microsoft Authenticator app in a meeting. Someone mentioned they store all their passwords in it rather than in Chrome / Edge. One of us - fairly senior member of the team- became concerned about this and basically said:
 &quot;Well the whole point of MFA is you have a known password, and then a thing, and that thing is either a hardware token, or the MFA app - However if the app now stores passwords, doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of MFA?&quot;
 From my point of view, it would be way too much of a faux pas if Microsoft just hadn&#x27;t thought of this, and with our phones being in Intune, they have to have a password, they likely have biometrics etc, so i cant see it being an issue?
 Also i just tried signing in with my work account to the password keeper part, and it wouldnt accept the details, as it needs to be a Microsoft account, not a Work or school account.
 Does anyone else have any views on this that would help me articulate clearly to my colleague why this wouldnt be a security issue? Thanks

                              <span>This may be a really dumb question, apologies if so. I have inherited a group policy that restricts which Edge browser extensions can be installed. There&#x27;s a lot in the list, but the policy only stores &quot;extension ID&quot;s and I can&#x27;t find a way to figure out what the extension is from the ID. Googling this just returns how to get the ID, not how to use the ID to figure out the name of the extension. 
 If anyone knows I would appreciate a point in the right direction!

 I am working with CIS custom Image for my EC2 - AMZ2 instance.
 I am facing a new finding in the Inspector result, which is:
 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected 
 The recommended action is to run the following command:
 # find -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk &#x27;{print \&quot;-a always,exit -F path&#x3D;&quot; $1 &quot; -F perm&#x3D;x - F auid&gt;&#x3D;1000 -F auid!&#x3D;4294967295 \-k privileged&quot; }&#x27; 
 And add the results to the:
 /etc/ audit/rules.d/audit.rules 
 ​
 But, when running this command; I got a syntax error.
 ​
 So, I tried to add the following lines (Containing my partitions) to the mentioned file, but this finding still appears in the inspector report.
 -a always,exit -F path&#x3D;/dev/xvda -F perm&#x3D;x -F auid&gt;&#x3D;1000 -F auid!&#x3D;4294967295 -k privileged -a always,exit -F path&#x3D;/dev/xvdb -F perm&#x3D;x -F auid&gt;&#x3D;1000 -F auid!&#x3D;4294967295 -k privileged

 It&#x27;s kind of a never ending topic, but I&#x27;d like to discuss it with you :
  
As a starting point, which firewall logs would you forward to your SIEM ?
 How do you improve your strategy over time ?
  
Do you go by log severity ? By policy ? What would be your different opinions ?
 I&#x27;ve been talking with many sysadmin and no one of them was doing it the same way. So I&#x27;d like to here your take on this subject !
 Thank y&#x27;all !

                              <span>Hello
 I manage a server for an important site which is regularly the target for DDoS attacks etc. The site is occasionally sending out newsletters to subscribers. That server is hosted on Hetzner. Hetzner has been contacting me with abuse requests (AbusePhishing: SPAM/PHISH Complaint) that people have sent them and is now threatening to shut down the server. I had a look at those forwarded emails and I discovered that the Message-ID hashes cannot be found in my /var/log/mail* logs (I have enough logs to cover the timestamps that those emails have allegedly been sent from my server). The emails content contains the newsletter content from the site but also appends various Pfizer spam links and images. All other legit emails that the site has sent can very easily be found via grepping their Message-IDs in /var/log/mail*.
 Question: Is there a possibility that a malicious actor has subscribed to the site&#x27;s newsletter, copy/pasted the email that was sent to them, polluted it with spam links, and reported this as an abuse to their provider, in hope that it&#x27;ll reach Hetzner which will in turn threaten with shutting down the server? Does this thing (&quot;fake spam abuse claims&quot;) actually exist? Have you heard about it before?

                              <span>So I read up on a lot of pros and cons of having multi-tenants and I have a good idea when it comes to enterprises. 
 However, if you work in Education or my case Higher Ed you know things are... different? 
 At the moment our staff and faculty have always used Exchange while students have always used Gmail. 
 Well, now we are going to move students over to Microsoft 365 along with exchange online.
 My question is, does your institute use different tenants? One for students and one for Staff? Or do you put them all under the same tenant and if so do you use different domains for each?
 I&#x27;m leaning toward having 2 tenants. 
 What have your experiences been?

                              <span>Hi fellow Redditors
 Due to also some recent ransomware that had attacked also my company&#x27;s competitor, some people, that in my and a colleague of mine opinion are trying to justify their pay, have had this &quot;novel&quot; idea to change the wallpaper of computers every week or so, with a message dedicated to educating ransomware/phishing techniques and avoiding them.
 There seems to be a good intention, for this, and I definitely agree, however, what i don&#x27;t agree with, is the way this is intended to educate the end user. 
 You see, the very end user audience that this is intended for has no time to pay too much attention to the text that is on the wallpaper. They are on the clock the soon they enter the premises, and they have to be ready to start working asap. 
 As a company, we have our internal courses for training purposes, and this includes almost every subject that touches the company, and some of those courses are mandatory, even for IT staff like me.
 However, having this type of messaging via wallpaper, seems overboard to me, and having to file requests to go before CAB, any GPO changes go to CAB no matter what the purpose is, for this is ludicrous.
 Time is better spent to educate the users with proper courses, not via a small text on the wallpaper, with horrible colours.
 ​
 So, my fellow professional Redditors, how would you approach this if it comes into your lap? What better solution would you recommend, and what is your general opinion of delivering messages via desktop wallpapers every other week or more?

                              <span>Hi there!
 My company went from around 150 employees to 600 in two years.
 User management is beginning to take its toll on our relatively small IT department.
 We currently have a Microsoft Form that HR submits with the User On- or Offboarding info. Name, e-mail, Department, Manager, Title, Accesses, Licenses etc. We then get this form sent to our helpdesk where we later create the user on-prem which later syncs to Azure.
 There is always something missing, wrong manager, new distribution group needed, additional access/licenses, wrong PC ordered, new start/end date, change of PIM etc,. It takes so much time from us.
 Is there a better way to handle these requests? Any third-party solutions?
 How do larger enterprises solve this? I can&#x27;t fathom them having guys only working full-time with user management (on this level).
 How do YOU do it in your company?
 Cheers!

                              <span>Is there anyone used MuleSoft platform ?
 I have one confusion.
 Do we deploy API in mulesoft platform itself ? or it help connecting customer APIs deployed in their environments ?

                              <span>The full data set is about 5TB and it will be split up into sets of 30-100 GB each. Performance of compression / decompression and encryption / decryption is kinda important (mainly because I don&#x27;t want the task to run for 5 weeks).
 Using tools / formats that are readily available on most machines (like zip) is helpful but not a must.
 For compression, it seems zstd is pretty sweet. I&#x27;ve never used it tho. Opinions or alternatives are very welcome.
 For encryption, I usually use GPG, but I&#x27;m concerned about performance. I&#x27;m open to both symmetric and asymmetric solutions.

Had my 2 year education beforehand on Germany, don&#x27;t know how Ausbildung is called in other countries..
 I&#x27;m nervous but I&#x27;m up to the challenge!
 I&#x27;m pumped, was a read only user of this sub for some years but I guess this will change in the future :).

 ​
 I&#x27;ll start with being completely honest. I have read through numerous posts here, avid lurker but haven&#x27;t had the gall to make a post until today. For disclaimer, Uni grad and did my fair share of CCNA but been thrown into a legal landscape (business decision) which hasn&#x27;t given me much room to go back to my IT roots. But this hasn&#x27;t stopped my interest in resolving every network related concern my office runs into. I am also not the network admin but I have learned every nook and cranny about our onsite network. I also need a very convincing argument to throw to the higher ups on what aspects about our network can we fix/improve or just straight up upgrade hardware or there won&#x27;t be any budget approvals. (Not my job, I know)
 An ongoing plague has been our current onsite co…</span>

 Are there any APs that you are aware of that allow for local management similar in performance/price point to the Aruba AP22/25 or Meraki Go lineup? I&#x27;m currently using the TPLink Eap670 (business line) and it&#x27;s alright, but wanted to see if there were more performance/quality to be had elsewhere. Thanks

                              <span>For work I&#x27;m deploying raspberry pi&#x27;s connecting through gateway devices with SIM cards having static IPs. We&#x27;ve kept default settings mostly, no firewall but no ports being forwarded, except 22 for ssh which goes to a DMZ and then to the pi. 443 and 80 take you to the gateway login screen.
 First question: Does having no firewall matter if we&#x27;re not forwarding any ports? Surely traffic just dies in a slightly different way?
 And much more importantly:
 Am I going to get DDoS&#x27;ed on port 22 any day now? /var/log/auth.log shows failed connection attempts every few minutes. The root account has a complex password with timeouts per attempt, so I&#x27;m not worried about access, but is it only a matter of time before some more ambitious bot discovers an open ssh port serving password attempts and has a thousand computers a common password dictionary on me? Or some Russian hackers take me down just so they can pretend I&#x27;m a drone bill the KGB?
 If yes, is the way to be safe to close down all ports and use openvpn to gain access? (This sucks because we&#x27;d like to access our gateway if the pi goes down). Or could I geo-lock access and save myself? 
 But at the end of the day, even if the gateway is set to deny all requests except ones from my own ip address, couldn&#x27;t someone DDoS the firewall? Is a static IP safe for small businesses without cloudflare or whatever?

 I was thinking about a F5 Big IP, but these are really expensive and seemingly unobtainium at this point, I tried emailing them and a couple of their resellers and heard nothing back. I also have a hard time justifying $15,000 for a load balancer before the HTTP side just to demo.
 I think I could justify a pair of NASs, but there&#x27;s a lot of moving parts and I have never seen files copied/downloaded at this speed. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 Just wondering if anyone has had any luck finding an easy solution to converting raw syslog messages from their network devices into CEF format so they can be ingested into Microsoft Sentinel properly?
 This seems like something a small docker container with syslog-ng or rsyslog should be able to handle, syslog in, cef out.
 I&#x27;m having no luck finding anything though so thought I would ask here before I spend the time trying to build it myself.
 Anyone come up with a good solution?

You can connect remotely to either a linux or windows machine with a static ip on this subnet. Is there an easy way to check to see if DHCP is being served without just enabling DHCP on the remote devices?

                              <span>Dear reddit,
 My company recently started a new project. The idea is that one entire building(500+ users) with different companies logs into one SSID. Every company will have his own vlan through a radius server. Printers should be available to all vlans. We used avahi(mDNS reflector) to make printers available in all vlan’s. But for obvious reasons we don’t want printers to broadcast itself. Since some printers shouldn’t be used by other companies.
 We tried:
 We tried blocking outgoing mDNS broadcast packages. But that didn’t help.
 We looked into avahi option’s. It doesn’t look like they cant regulate traffic like we want.
 Same for aruba switch, it supports mDNS reflection. But cant actually regulate traffic like i want?
 Question:
 Is there a different way to make this happen? Or is there an good way to regulate these mDNS packages?
 Thanks,
 Luc
 Edit:
 So in the building we got flex spots. So sometimes different companies will use different places in the building. Thats why its import most of the printers should still be available.

                              <span>Hey Guys...So I have a 15u server cabinet that I&#x27;m thinking of mounting on an already installed plywood in a closet. The issue is that the space on it is taken up by other things such as pre-installed telco equipment and cables. My question is has anyone mounted some 2x4&#x27;s on the plywood to mount the cabinet to in order to clear said cable bundle? I also have another section where I can mount the cabinet to on concrete block at a height that is reachable. The issue is that it will be very tight in that section and also very close to a power panel. If it doesn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;ve managed to source some caster wheels for said cabinet to keep on floor level, but it would be a lot cleaner looking on the wall and out of the way. Any advice or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 This is a real life scenario thrown at me. I would rather set it up gateways on the devices but currently works fine on layer 2 with no plans to scale.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running iBGP between 2 servers where 1 of the servers is announcing all subnets to upstream (for IPv6).
 They are both running Debian and BIRD2. Server A has 2 neighbors 1 - Upstream provider 2 - server B.
 Server A and B are link using GREv6. 
 Server B only has 1 neighbor with server A and has dummy NIC with IP address I want to announce. 
 The BGP session establish just fine. The subnet server B trying to announce does show up on bgp.tools/ However, I can&#x27;t ping address on server B from outside. When I ping from server A, it gives TTL expired. When I run traceroute on server A, it&#x27;s looping on A until it expires. Any idea on what I could do to actually pass the packet to server B via GRE?
 This configuration is basically the same on server A and B just swap different IP for local and remote.
 protocol bgp server{
 local GREv6IP as OURASN;
 neighbor GREv6RemoteIP as OURASN;
 ipv6 {
 import all;
 export all;
 };
 }
 ​
 Any idea would be appreciated.

                              <span>Anybody else have trouble with the PC version of AnyConnect repeatedly disconnecting and reconnecting while tethered to an AT&amp;T iPhone? I have no issue when tethering to the same phone with the AnyConnect mobile client on an iPad. I have this issue when connecting both to my primary and backup ASAs. I found a few really old threads related to this issue but haven&#x27;t found a solution.

                              <span>I work for a company who&#x27;s recently made the decision to move towards getting certified CMMC (certainly level 1, but ideally level 2 and even 3 once it releases). I wear a lot of IT hats for the company, but managing anything network related is definitely among my responsibilities. So I&#x27;m here trying to figure out what I need to do to make our network CMMC level 2 compliant. It should also be noted that as a company we&#x27;re still figuring out what we need to do to make ourselves compliant, so I may not be in possession of all of the facts in terms of my requirements.
 Currently we&#x27;re running with a series of Cisco SG/SF series switches (which are nearly all ready to be life-cycled, which fits the plan fairly well) but as I understand it, one of the hard requirements are that (at the very lea…</span>

                              <span>I have a large multi-site environment with about a thousand APs total. I don&#x27;t know if site surveys were ever done, and some buildings have been remodeled since wifi was first deployed. I am wanting something better than just trial and error moving/installing APs and checking client-side performance.
 I think this would be a helpful tool, and if it was under $500 I would just buy one. However, I wanted to hear from others before dropping multiple thousands of dollars on such a tool. 
 Does anyone here own an Ekahau or similar device? Do you use it often? Has it been worth the cost in your opinion?

                              <span>Hello Networkers!
 Need some advice and insight. How have you all managed routing in a mixed vendor environment? My question is specifically with Juniper vs Cisco: route preference vs administrative distance?
 Still working on the details, but as of now we have branch office router seeing two default routes one in IGP OSPF and another in BGP. One of the default routes is for internet access and the other from corporate (Incase the internet default goes down).
 The branch router runs IOS-XE, Corp device is Juniper, and the internet default comes from a Palo-Alto FW.
 Our Juniper rep has said to change Cisco’s AD values to match theirs and guess what our Cisco rep said the same thing for Juniper! I get the feeling they are just looking to gain an advantage over the other and not really engineering anything. So I have come here looking for suggestions and insight.
 Edit:spelling and details

                              <span>Hey good peeps, I recently noticed a few Cat6s on a switch dropping out intermittently. The ping -t test gave following results:
 Packets sent &#x3D; 117, Received &#x3D; 60, Lost &#x3D; 57 (48% loss). This loss percentage varies between 45-80%.
 Approx round trip time in ms &#x3D; 
 average &#x3D; 4-14ms, max &#x3D; 767ms 
 These Cat6s are running from devices in field to a control station. There is some electric interference present around them (120V) but these are 600V rated Cat6 cables. Since they are 600V rated, they are very bulky. Customer suggested us that the weight of the cables could be causing the issue at the switch. I find that difficult to believe since only 4 out of 60 Cat6s are acting up.
 I am thinking as a first step of troubleshooting to re-terminate both ends for the cables. Sounds like an easy thing to do but not so easy when a lot of other parties are involved.
 What could be the most likely cause for this? Any suggestions?
 Appreciate the help!

                              <span>There is a very very long story here but to sum it up nice and quick here my son has been accused of sending a threat into school through a program that uses Microsoft Student Data Link for single sign-on AND this other program has some ability to email his teachers. The threat was sent via this program and is delivered through to the teachers regular office email.
 I&#x27;ve asked the school to provide IP address of his logins during the day but they only provided/obtained the schools external IP address. They did not provide any internal IP address, obviously the internal IP address with login data is the most valuable for us.
 Can anyone think of a why where we can be sure this data is retained while we work with a lawyer? I&#x27;ve made the request with the school now on two different occasions. Can anyone think of other information that I might not be thinking about?

                              <span>Good Morning! I am newer to this issue so please bear with me. 
 I am troubleshooting an issue in which i getting reported latency to an application on an external site. I have a user saying that when he is on prem, he is getting latency of 10-25 seconds accessing the site but when he is on our VPN connection to our prem network, its 2-3 seconds. Is there any logical reason that this site is taking longer to access on site than VPN? Ive always know the opposite to be true with VPN users having issues with latency. I am at a impasse since due to security restrictions, most of the routers upstream dont respond to icmp so tracing the hops is out of the question. 
 Appreciate any ideas and sorry if this sounds jumbled, i am pre-caffeine brain.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I had a quick question regarding my new jobs network setup. Bare with me, as this is the first time I have ever worked with Cisco Devices, so my knowledge of them is fairly slim.
 Here is the situation broken down very simply:
 - We have 2 ISP Connections (Primary and Backup)
 - We have 1 CORE Cisco Switch (Cisco 6807XL)
 - We have 2 CheckPoint Firewalls setup in &quot;High Availability Mode&quot;
 Now here is where I THINK I understand the setup, but in reality I need clarification or for someone to tell me that I have it worked out in my head correctly lol.
 I have roughed up a very rudimentary drawing of how it is setup -- Here is the link: https://ibb.co/zhBwnK1
 All I am curious about is:
 1.) For the ISP Connections... They are going into Ports that are tagged as VLAN 17 &amp; 18 .... And the Firewalls are connected to more ports that are also tagged as VLAN 17 &amp; 18 ----- Does this mean that the Internet is &quot;piping into that first port&quot; and then any other ports that are tagged as 17 / 18 ... are automatically getting blanketed with that ISP connection (Just like how an unmanaged switch works)? And Thus.... in the Eyes of the Firewalls, the Firewall&#x27;s WAN Port just thinks that you took the Ethernet cable from the back of each Modem... and plugged it straight into the Firewall?
 In all my years of experience with networking, I have only ever seen the chain look like this:
 ISP Modem &gt;&gt;&gt; Firewall &gt;&gt;&gt; Core Switch &gt;&gt;&gt; Smaller Switches &gt;&gt;&gt; PC&#x27;s / Printers / AP&#x27;s / Etc
 So the fact that this job is setup backwards (in my eyes) as:
 ISP Modem(s) &gt;&gt;&gt; Core Switch &gt;&gt;&gt; Firewall &gt;&gt;&gt; Smaller switches &gt;&gt;&gt; PC&#x27;s / Printers / AP&#x27;s / Etc ---- And the fact that I am a Cisco novice lol... Its the perfect storm for confusion.
 I hope this makes sense, and if anyone has any thoughts - I would greatly appreciate them!
 Thanks,

 I’m looking for the hardware specifications of the Huawei HG8247Q modem router.
 Photo: https://imgur.com/a/KUa4hag
 Specifically I would like to know if the 4 Ethernet ports, are Gigabit or not. I&#x27;ve always assumed they were gigabit.
 Can you help me ? I’ve tried to find the information online but I’m not being successful. Huawei&#x27;s site was asking for a sign-in just to download the documentation. And even after registering a free account, it still doesn’t allow me to download it because it seems this equipment is considered corporate. It’s quite frustrating.

                              <span>We have a division that the CISO wants us whitelisted URLs only. It&#x27;s a chore, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been TOO bad. Right now, we&#x27;re in the middle of onboarding a new application that wants to go to s3.amazonaws.com. CISO refuses to whitelist that URL because we don&#x27;t want to have access to every single s3 bucket out there. Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m stuck: As far as I can tell in firewall logs and pcaps, the app isn&#x27;t even trying to reach a particular region or bucket: it&#x27;s just trying to hit the broad s3.amazonaws.com domain. If that&#x27;s true, then how do I restrict this application&#x27;s access? 
 I know precious little about how AWS works on the back end, so feel free to ELI5. I feel like there&#x27;s some kind of fundamental misunderstanding I have that would solve everything, if only I knew what that was.

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 Im curious about how a site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnel works where one end have a public IP and the other end have a private IP.
 ​
 For example, let say on site A: we have a firewall that is connected to a router. The WAN interface on the firewall is a private IP, 192.168.1.1/30 and is connected to a port on the router, and the routers WAN port pointing to the ISP, have a public IP.
 ​
 So,
  
How can we establish a VPN tunnel between the sites and how would the configuration look like? I know for example that on site A, the router needs to forward port 500 &amp; 4500 for IPsec communication. But from site B, what would the peering IP be since private IPs are not routable on the internet?
 And how would the configuration would look like on site A when configuring a peering IP? I think that you need to NAT on site A but my brain just wont let me understand how this would exactly work out when I tried to lab it.
  
​
 Appreciate your help.
 ​
 EDIT: I want to understand how to establish a VPN tunnel between the firewalls, so from site A firewall that have a private IP to the firewall on site B that have a public IP, sorry for not clarifying it.

 The hosts need to talk to each other, and each stack is the layer 3 gateway for its respective host.
 How would you expand this to avoid the switch stack as a single point of failure, without the benefit of purchasing any new equipment other than more 3850 stacks.
 Splitting the stacks and connecting the 4 switches together is an option, but now we have a spanning tree loop (that&#x27;s blocked, but still)
 Is there a better way?
 Quick edit, obviously there ARE better ways, with equipment that would support VSS, vPC, MLAG, etc. But in this case, let&#x27;s pretend we only have access to 3850s.

 I have a comware OS switch (C-Sw) that I&#x27;m looking to get started with VLANs but it&#x27;s not going well. Previous config that &#x27;worked&#x27; saw C-Sw without VLANs and connected via single SFP+ to upstream switch (Brocade, B-Sw) and then to pfSense over LAGG. This worked - hosts could ping each other across B-Sw and C-Sw and out to greater internet (if allowed). It&#x27;s unfortunately router-on-stick- model with pfSense doing routing (and I want to change that next phase).
 Next phase config - I want to deploy some hypervisors to the hosts connected to C-Sw and want/need some VLAN support so I can correctly segment client from various mgmt networks. The usual. 
 Approach - I&#x27;ve tried to translate the working B-Sw config (Lagg, trunk ports, vlan membership) across to C-Sw but there is no lo…</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 Network admin with 5~ years under my belt, previously sys admin for a year before that, and help desk for 10 that did a lot of the networking stuff because I was interested in it. 
 I&#x27;ve recently got a new job, that&#x27;s in an EXTREMELY fast paced environment. I&#x27;ve never used a Palo Alto before, but I have used Cisco FTD, Meraki, Watchguard, and SonicWall. I&#x27;ve set up IPSec tunnels, static routes, VLANs, etc. Everything you&#x27;d expect a mid-tier network admin to be able to do. However I&#x27;m now starting off in my Palo Alto project to migrate from our SonicWall and I am STRUGGLING.
 There are certain things in the interface I can do just by looking at it. DHCP, static routes, interface creation, etc etc. But I am struggling really hard in a lot of other places. I&#x27;m know it&#x27;s me, but the …</span>

                              <span>Hi, we have an ICS network with about 20 switches running RSTP in our DC
 These are basically all access switches, with one of the switches connected to the main SCADA-server which all the hosts on each access switch are constantly sending metrics to.
 Is RSTP recommended here? Is there any other protocol to use? Do you recommend changing the structure to some kind of 2/3-tier topology with access/distribution layers instead?

                              <span>Hi everyone
 I’m currently a senior telephony engineer, my career began in 2015 (I self studied CCNA and whilst studying, took the leap and applied for junior network engineer job and landed one, I did not go university so I have no degree) I stayed at my first job for about 1 year and then moved onto another network role as the colleague I worked with was awful and I wasn’t learning much from him, just experiencing his anger issues at everyone and anyone each day. 
 Second job rolls around and it’s going great until they push me into telephony, aren’t paying me enough but are making me juggle both network and telephony and then one day decide I have to cut out networking and focus on telephony, I then get a call for another telephony job and I go for it as it’s paying more, I get it so I move on.. I stayed there for about 10 months and then I got a call for my current job and I’ve been here for nearly 3 years. 
 Now.. my current workplace are getting rid of all Cisco telephony and moving onto MS teams, no issue there but I’m not feeling any personal development for myself and I’m not sure if I should get my CCNA and go back into networking (also worried about a salary cut as i’m now a mum and I also support my mum financially as my dad left when I was very young) or do I delve into the cyber space as I always had an interest for it.
 My husband is suggesting I try programming as he’s in the field and he thinks, with my background I won’t have a problem landing a job if I can learn and understand it.

                              <span>Fyi- I am pretty new to azure and its SDN setup. But my question is, is there a way to create a default route in azure to send all internet destined traffic to my palo alto vm that is internet facing? Furthermore, is there a way to advertise that same default route and advertise it to a downstream spoke via eBGP, in this case OCI assuming that the eBGP peering is already in place between the two clouds. Would I perhaps need an azure route server , and pass this default route from my palo vm via ebgp, so that azure/oci internet traffic all goes out of the internet interface of the palo vms?

 If I copy a 500Mb file from my computer in NY (local C: drive) to a file share in London, it takes 10 seconds give or take. 
 If I transfer a 2MB folder containing 100 - 12kb files, from the same C: drive to the same network share in London, it’s takes 5 minutes to transfer the files. 
 Any ideas? All are welcome to respond.

 part of my campus a pretty large flex connect local switching deployment, I had a question is a &quot;Flex connnect Roam&quot; treated the same by mobility as a regular L2 or L3 client roam, when a roam happens from one AP to a different ap connected on a different controller?

                              <span>Hey all, I’m having an issue where one computer will intermittently loose connection to another device on my network but I can ping the computer from the device. 
 Example, the main device on my network will loose connection with another device but it I plug directly into the switch on that device I can see/connect with the device that is not seeing the other device.
 Also if I plug my laptop directly into the cat cable on the device that can’t see the other devices I can see/connect to that device. A reboot of the device that is having issues fixes the problem. 
 I should also add that there is no firewall enabled and it’s super intermittent and it’s not always the same device when it happens but every time the only fix I’ve found is to reboot.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 i don&#x27;t know if this question is allowed (Rule #6), but i don&#x27;t get the necessary pieces together.
 I found the following article / documentation for Proxmox which mentioned the use of OVS for SDN deployments.
 Now to my question: How can i route traffic from a specific VXLAN (VM inside of a VXLAN) to the &quot;outer world&quot; such as physical servers or other networks? Or even intra VNI traffic? The best case scenario would be that a firewall could handle all these cases. 
 To be clear i don&#x27;t expect a full-answer to this question. A hint would be sufficient which guides me to the pieces or knowledge i am currently missing.
 Thanks in advance of all people who are wiser and kinder then me ^^
 Regards a Rookie

                              <span>Hi, I have two physically separated networks, one is 192.168.0.0/20 (1G copper) and the other is 172.16.8.0/24 (10G fiber). The 172 network has no gateway out to the internet, and configured manually on the workstation (no dhcp)
 Some clients are physically connected to both (copper / fiber). Machines with 10G cards connect to the 172 network to connect to file servers, and use the 192 to get to the internet. 
 Would connecting these two networks to each other, via a fiber cable from the 192 switch to the 172 switch, cause a loop? Or should I pull the copper from each workstation first? I want to phase out the 172 network, and have the 192 network access 1G and 10G infrastructure.

                              <span>Hello, I work in a logistics depot for a large company that provides laptops/desktops to employees all over the country. Techs remote access these devices and configure them for the users before they are shipped out. 
 Part of my Job duties include making sure these assets are connected to our wifi network and available to remote into, usually between 200-300 at a time. Recently I&#x27;ve noticed that our AP&#x27;s have been dropping assets more than usual and I would like to monitor the devices proactively vs waiting for a tech to inform me that one has lost connection and they are unable to remote into it. 
 I keep an excel sheet with all the assets listed by Serial number and location and I&#x27;m looking for some sort of solution to monitor this list and make sure all assets on the list are pingable and showing connected. I am a contractor and have ZERO access to the access points or wifi network so I obtain IPs by pinging the serial number. 
 This may not be the best place to ask this but I figured it&#x27;s simple enough that people in this group would understand my question and probably know of a simple solution. 
 Also I have a very small amount of technical experience, mostly all self taught for this position and solving my own problems at home. I know some basics, but way less than most of you probably lol.

                              <span>Ok so what am I missing, I am trying to nat a non routed public IP to a private IP so that hosts coming from an AWS vpn can talk to a server on prem. I have the following config and believe I have everything but it is not working.
 ​
 Hypothetical IP&#x27;s
 Server IP - 1.2.3.4
 AWS NAT - 192.168.1.10
 AWS Range - 10.0.0.0/8
 nat (Inside,Outside) source static SERVER_IP AWS_NAT destination static AWS_RANGE AWS_RANGE
 access-list filter_aws extended permit tcp object AWS_RANGE object SERVER_IP eq 8000
 route Outside 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 OUTSIDE_INTERFACE_IP
 ​
 Trying to connect from the AWS Range to the AWS NAT IP fails.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t seem to find a good answer; maybe my Google-Fu is weak. Due to some provider limitations, we&#x27;re looking at using two firewalls for egress from a specific location and want to make sure that client/server conversations stick to a single firewall. Current plan is to use static routing with IP SLA health checks and set each egress at the same weight. What I can&#x27;t figure out is what load balance mechanism for static routes is used on IOS XE on a Cat9400 or Cat4500. Is it just src/dst IP or is there more to it than that? Labbed in Eve-NG with IOSv and it appeared to be src/dst IP but I don&#x27;t know how to confirm that hardware will function the same way.

                              <span>Hello, i am in a situation where i have been for the past 8 years working in data communication department (not really focused on networking but did projects) also studied CCNA and degree in computer networks. Not that much experience in networking working day to day as you guys do and furthermore I work 4 shifts day, night rest off (good for work-life balance). Our ICT department just split in half NOC and SOC, and head of NOC is vacant. I have always been keen and worked very hard. The vacancy requirements, I full fill them all but I have to start to work 5 days a week from work and, later on, I can work remotely. My biggest concern is my lack of experience, not in a managerial position but in knowing all the systems that they work on. What are your suggestions shall I apply knowing I lack experience and then if I will be chosen I learn along the way?

I have a POE switch already but I am looking to power like a 5 port switch from this to save on the amount of electrical sockets I need. I saw a few that had this but they are all managed which is not ideal as what I need them for is just purely networking. Advice on this is also welcome.

I have no mac address for it and can&#x27;t find it with any scan tool or anything. I can&#x27;t hardware reset it in any way and I had access only via network. It also has an open telnet port 23 that I don&#x27;t know how to use and if I can access it.
 Any help will be really appreciated. 🙏

                              <span>Hello all,
 Hopefully someone has insight that can help me out. We have a relatively simple setup using a C3750 for inband mgmt (that&#x27;s all it does, no high work load or QoS). The C3750 advertises it&#x27;s LAN network into BGP, route is seen job done.
 C3750------BGP-----SSH Client
 |fa1
 |
 | LAN 192.168.0.1/24
 |
 |vme0ACX 192.168.0.2
 However and recently a couple of new deployments are seeing intermittent traffic loss to the end points behind the C3750 device. The C3750 it&#x27;s self remains stable, no high CPU or mem usage. Traffic to it see no drops. Only traffic that must be routed via the C3750.
 Looking at the interface counters we see Xmit-Err and OutDiscards e.g.
 show interfaces counters errors Port Align-Err FCS-Err Xmit-Err Rcv-Err UnderSize OutDiscards Fa1/0/1 0 0 1106 0 0 1106 Fa1/…</span>

                              <span>Hello all,
 The organization I work for is merging one AD domain into a larger domain. I&#x27;ve combed this sub and some forums so I&#x27;m going to answer the question I think I&#x27;m going to get fist: yes we have contracted with a company that has software that does this very thing.
 Here&#x27;s the issue. For as good as this company used to be, it&#x27;s gone downhill in recent years. The support (or lack of) we&#x27;re getting is making us think they have no idea how the tool works. We&#x27;re a small outfit so it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;ve given us less experienced techs, but we&#x27;re still talking about moving 800 endpoints and a lot of files. I&#x27;m getting nervous about using the tool to re-permission files when they don&#x27;t seem to have a grasp on what the tool is doing. I want a backup plan.
 The sAMAccountName is the same in both source and target domain. File servers are located in and permissioned to the target domain.
 Here&#x27;s my question: does anyone have a suggestion for a tool or script that can view the permissions for files in the source domain and add the matching target domain user?
 I&#x27;m more of a bash guy, but I can learn enough PowerShell to get this job done if necessary. I do have a full set of backups should the worst happen.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I am positive I am doing something someone else has done and my google-fu is failing me. I am not a VMware guy, but our on-prem data center is 100% VMware. Today I use packer to build and distribute our new monthly windows images to our azure regions. Word made it to the powers that be that my image is better documented (infra as code essentially) and more consistent than what our on-prem server team is doing. So naturally they decided that I should just &quot;provide the image&quot; to the infra team to use on the vcenters. Problem is I am way out of my element here. I have a repeatable process to get the azure images down as an VHD to the hybrid runbook worker. The problem I haven&#x27;t figured out is how to get them into a format the VMware guys can use. 
 So with the long context out of the way, anyone got any good step by step guides or YouTube video they can recommend to get azure images into vSphere as a template? Or a tool that easily converts VHD files into a VMware vSphere friendly template format?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I ordered a gen 2 T14 with win 11 pro, 11th gen i5, 16gb RAM, 512 SSD 
 It looks like there aren’t a whole lot of differences in the Gen 3 other than the 12th Gen i5 but it’s like $1000 more. Is it REALLY worth the spend to go into a newer generation of processor? I’m open to extra spend if it’s justified, but I’m drawing a blank other than it’s slightly better performance. 
 These laptops will be for standard users who mainly just run office apps and PDFs so not power users or anything. 
 Thanks!

Mid-sized company, 350-ish employees and the finance team absolutely insists that I put everything on our damn company credit cards rather than cutting a check or ACH. Critical services like telecom, the AWS bill, other cloud services, literally everything.
 They also won&#x27;t let me use terms billing with vendors like Amazon, because you have to pay those invoices with a check, so I get to reconcile dozens of receipts separately every month.
 I&#x27;ve tried arguing against it, citing the PITA that ensues every time there&#x27;s suspected or actual fraud on the card and I have to get a new one, or when we&#x27;ve gone over the company limit and my card is just dead for 2-3 days. But oh no, &quot;this is what management prefers.&quot;

I&#x27;ve been fiddling with a bunch of products and would love to hear any real world feedback on what folks are switching to for VPN. I have a small office network but most stuff in AWS. 
 So far, I&#x27;ve been recommended:
 - Twingate: most often recommended in my circle and I use it for my homelab. Super easy to use and nice integrations. Curious to learn from anyone who&#x27;s ran this in production at their company.
 - Cloudflare: eng team uses their CDN so easy to tack-on for their VPN product. Finding it pretty gnarly to set up and maintain and generally seems like a half-baked product. Anyone using this?
 - Zscaler: friends who work at bigcos use this, but honestly seems a little overkill. Sales process to even get a trial to POC was a pain, but seems very full featured. 
 - Tailscale: lots of people use it for homelab, but haven&#x27;t found anyone who uses it for their company. Generally doesn&#x27;t seem serious for businesses (most of those same people pointed me to Twingate to compare). Any one using it for their company?
 Have looked at a bunch of others as well, but shortlisting the above. Looking for some real world feedback.

                              <span>Seems products and services are being pushed out with glaring issues.
 &quot;Support&quot; teams are clueless. Customer service is completely absent. 
 The first response is often a generic request for information that was provided in a ticket.
 Reactions to basic questions like &quot;You&#x27;ve collected logs, how and when should I expect to receive an update?&quot; make it seem as though I&#x27;m speaking a different language.
 Tickets go into black holes, and I have to call and speak to a supervisor to get something as basic as a status update.
 Seriously - speaking as someone that manages a support team, the people managing these teams should be embarassed to go to work.
 Am I alone here or have things seriously gone to shit?

                              <span>CFO of our largest client has been having intermittent wireless issues on his laptop. Not when connecting to the corporate or even his home network, only to the crappy free Wi-Fi at hotels and coffee shops. Real curious, that.
 God forbid such an important figure degrade himself by submitting a ticket with the rest of the plebians, so he goes right to the CIO (who is naturally a subordinate under the finance department for the company). CIO goes right to my boss...and it eventually finds its way to me.
 Now I get to work with CFO about this (very high priority, P1) &#x27;issue&#x27; of random hotel guest Wi-Fi sometimes not being the best.
 I&#x27;m so tired of having to drop everything to babysit executives for nonissues. Anyone else feel similarly?

                              <span>Do you leave the Windows firewall enabled on workstations and servers? Or do you just have it enabled on workstations or servers? We currently have it disabled across the board via GPO but I am in the process of enabling the firewall internally. I&#x27;m just not sure if I want to enable it on servers. Seems like a disaster to have to whitelist every port that&#x27;s being used.
 UPDATE: Thanks everyone. I obviously knew what the answer was going to be but wanted to bring this to management to prove that this is an issue. This network was inherited and the org definitely has a lot of &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&quot; mentality.

                              <span>Howdy! 
 We have multiple servers that ~70 staff use daily that I would like to migrate to drive.google.com given the age of the equipment and the recent string of hard drive failures ... but after asking everyone to pair down to the current data versus legacy we still have many department folders that are over the 400,000 items/object limit 
 Since a shared drive can contain a maximum of 400,000 items/objects ( including files, folders, and shortcuts) I&#x27;m not sure what to do ... also given the large quantity I&#x27;m concerned about how well the Google Drive for Desktop application will work (everyone uses macOS and some computers are 5 years old)
 Through discussion, staff have agreed they can split out the files they don&#x27;t need constant access to e.g. an &quot;active archive file server website&quot; and could access via a different site/service or similar but I&#x27;m not sure what would be a good service to support split access and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Looked at Backblaze B2 but its not really built for that. Google cloud storage supports the idea of it but is expensive and still isn&#x27;t really designed to be easily browsed like a filesystem. Certainly Dropbox or similar services could work well ... but we&#x27;re duplicating systems and costs then which seems silly. Management suggested just start new on drive.google.com and keep running the legacy servers but that doesn&#x27;t fix the issue of the old, failing equipment.
 In a perfect world there would be select folders that you would stream to Google Drive for Desktop and then others would only be available at drive.google.com but that doesn&#x27;t seem possible like it once was in older versions? Thought about setting up a separate Google active-archive user that staff could login to but with 70 people and changing staff that seems cumbersome at best. 
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks!
 -Adam

                              <span>Hi,
 Backupify was driving me nuts,
 I just switched to AFS last night, they backed up my 100GB mailbox in 5:06 minutes, insane speed.
 They gave me option to choose datacenter which I could not find with other solutions, this made compliance easy for one of our domains has to be in Canada due to healthcare rules.
 The interface is clunky, but the speed and cost are amazing,
 I wanted to go back to spinbackup due to the search/discovery and security features for multi-domain environments (I find it cheaper then enhancing and building policies in multi-domains), but their prices seemed to have doubled in the pandemic and the multi-domain is complicated.
 AFS seems to hit the multi-domain part well, I got various licenses at multiple entities so getting a solution where everything is under one hood is nice. I have some domains with Gsuite+M365 and others that are just Gsuite and some just M365.
 Anyways the setup and configuration took me about 25 minutes, I set it all up myself and have all my sites / teams / mailboxes etc... all backed up now and I am saving a few hundred bucks a month which I will use now to setup some other compliance tools.
 I am still searching for a solution that has a faster and easier interface to run searches across multi-domains / platforms (Gsuite/M365), right now I use an expensive tool and its a pain in the bum for the queries, if anyone knows of a moderately priced solution like AFS I am interested. I have to run searches for PDF&#x27;s and the content within PDF&#x27;s regularly, which is why I sync things to google drive as they have ability to search PDF&#x27;s.

                              <span>The firm I work for has a small residential site in a rural area in the UK (South/West Wales). From the looks of it there&#x27;s no chance of anything other than 3mbit ADSL via the phone line or less than ideal 4G using an external antenna. There&#x27;s no altnets in the area and leased lines are looking at £800/month which isn&#x27;t really feasible.
 However, as this site will need to provide public and staff internet connectivity we will need decent bandwidth (say up to 80mbit download), so we&#x27;re looking to use starlink to provide this.
 I was wondering if anyone here has used Starlink for this kind of fixed site job and had any information regarding reliability and ease of configuration? My main worry is being able to use my own router/firewall if the supplied unit doesn&#x27;t have the features we need. Also does anyone know if the &quot;domestic&quot; tier has any acceptable use limits?

 Google Workspace: 
 Our team is continuing to investigate this issue. We will provide an update by Nov 2, 2022, 2:30 PM UTC with more information about this problem. Thank you for your patience. The affected users are able to access Google Workspace Support, but are seeing error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior.
 Users are unable to create Japanese and English chat cases with Google Workspace Support from the chat flow in the Admin Console.
 As a workaround, the customers may choose any other language from the dropdown to Communicate in English or Japanese or any other support channel at the moment.

 I&#x27;ve used VMNetworkAdapterVlan -Trunk to pass a number of VLANs to the SR-IOV enabled vNIC in the VM.
 I&#x27;m using a nightly of VyOS and have an extremely simple single interface config for validation. I am able to use tcpdump and see tagged traffic coming in on the parent interface.
 But I am unable to get traffic out the NIC tagged. Is this a limitation of SR-IOV in Hyper-V? I have been down so many rabbit holes with VF security and MAC spoofing and filtering and nearly all information is targeting KVM not Hyper-V.
 Has anyone been able to get guest VLAN tagging through SR-IOV?

 All of the hardware I am testing this on is Windows 11 Capable with TPM enabled, including my own one, a laptop with a Ryzen 5700U, 32GB RAM and TPM 2.0 enabled with the recovery code backed up to AD.
 To double check its compatibility, I ran this &quot;Hardware Readiness&quot; script on the two devices I anticipated being Windows 11 compatible, and both provide the same &quot;Capable&quot; result below.

 I know how to do it normally so I can manually go and install the updates on all the machines. But I would like to know if there is a way to set it up to download, install, and do no restart the machine. This way I can tell the person in question to restart his computer every Thurday morning when he comes into the office.
 Any ideas?

 I am not worried about making use of company devices for personal purposes, as this is easily covered by a policy. 
 I am thinking of tools like network sniffers or vulnerability scanners that are normally acceptable on system administrators&#x27; devices, but may occasionally be required by someone else to troubleshoot specific code projects etc...

                              <span>Good Morning,
 Hopefully someone can help as I&#x27;ve run out of ideas.
 I have an old tenant and a new tenant. Both are using Microsoft Purview Encryption&#x27;s &#x27;Encrypt-only&#x27; option within the Outlook desktop client.
 If old tenant sends an email to newer tenant, the new tenant can read the email natively within the Outlook desktop app.
 If the new tenant sends an email to the older tenant, the old tenant has to go to Outlook on the web to access.
 Bits you might want to know.
  
Both using Exchange Online
 Both are using Microsoft Outlook for Microsoft 365 MSO (version 2208 on new tenant, version 2209 on old tenant).
 I&#x27;ve tried doing this manually via the Outlook client and via DLP, but same experience.
  
If someone has an answer or guidance, I&#x27;d really appreciate it.
 Thanks,
 Max

                              <span>Hi, Can anyone share the difference of Qualys Scan_Report_VM and Qualys Scan_Report_QCA? also the report from snycr file?
 After performing remediation on the vulnerabilities listed on Scan_VM_Report, the vulnerabilities are not detected anymore, but we can still see the vulnerabilities detected on snycr file.
 Also, there are other vulnerabilities on Scan_Report_QCA file. I&#x27;m kind of confuse on the three files.
 Responses is greatly appreciated.

 I haven&#x27;t done any configuration changes before restarting the service, and I don&#x27;t know the exact root cause for this failure. Please help me with this.

                              <span>Are you aware of this breach? 
 Yesterday, Dropbox admit a breach in which their 130 code repositories were exposed to attackers and revealed that it happened by phishing emails impersonating CircleCI, a code integration and delivery platform. When I came across the news, I found that 
  
A few thousand names and email addresses of Dropbox employees, current and past customers, sales leads, and vendors were exposed. 
  
On October 14, the account got breached by the attackers through a phishing campaign impersonating CircleCI. The phishing link redirects employees to the fake CircleCI login page and asks for their GitHub username and password. Also, they are asked to pass an OTP using a hardware authentication key. 
 How threatening! Please remember that

                              <span>So I have a domain with 5 servers in it run in HYPER-V. 2 are DC&#x27;S the other 3 have dedicated functions (fileserver, print server, software server). All of the servers are running the windows time service is this correct? Using w32tm query on the primary DC I see the NTPServer is set to time.windows.com however the clocks on all servers and workstation are continuously loosing time a few minutes every 6 months or so. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I should do here. If I adjust the time manually on the DC it will change the time everywhere else but why is it continuously falling behind? Note I have replaced the cmos battery on the physical server just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t coming from there.

                              <span>At a university, I use to work at we installed over 150 APs around the campus. Many in a mesh with the AP hanging on a pole and powered by solar/batteries. All the switch gear, the routers, and the wireless bridges are also Ubiquiti. After 5 years I replaced 3 APs. I was out there yesterday and some of the same APs are still running 8 years later (I had to go look at it and do the whole &quot;I installed this years ago&quot; routine to everyone).
 We have a mesh with over 300 Unifi APs in the small town I live in and other than the occasional dickweed that tears one up there have never been any issues.

 ​
 I am currently working on a ticket. Our customer has dell optiplex 3000 wyse clients and they want to use a webcam in there rdp session.
 ​
 The wyse client does see the webcam and under device manager on windows the webcam is picked up. Howerver it cant be used.
 Things I tried:
 - Reinstalling drivers for the webcam
 - usb redirection set in wms using 0xvvvppp format
 - usb redirection is activated
 ​
 I am completely at a loss at the moment. Does anybody has any ideas?

 ​
 For debugging purposes, I do not only need to see, when a tool does start a network connection. I also want to see, when it is terminated/finished.
 ​
 Are you aware of any possibility to log &quot;Network connection closed&quot; with sysmon or any other tool additional to &quot;Network connection detected&quot; on Windows systems?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

A solution was posted that said you could turn off whitelisting by typing -Djenkins.security.ClassFilterImpl.SUPPRESS_WHITELIST&#x3D;true 
 The answer was marked as solved by the OP. This is probably the solution for my problem, The only question i have is, Where do i type the command?

                              <span>We’re experiencing an issue with some scheduled tasks not running after the clocks going back this weekend. 
 In the Task Scheduler the next run time is correct, however the task never actually runs. 
 Has anyone else experienced this?

                              <span>Is it so alien to some people that we are not backing up local data? We put so much efforts into security and file servers and cloud and give them the best and easiest way to share\work and do their job efficiently and safely with daily\weekly\monthly backup yet they keep working locally and save stuff on desktop and when the disk getting corrupted or they are absent for months and we need to repurpose the workstation for something else they are angry I can&#x27;t restore their local files. I am the only sysadmin at the company so I basically in charge of the entire IT of the company, I sends weekly reminders for right way to work whether it&#x27;s about security stuff\ suspicious mails and not working local. Every time a new employee goes through clearance for the first time, I open a personal folder for them on the network and explain to do all their work from their because we backup daily and can restore if something happen, they can share it with each other and manage it very easily . I send mail and map it as a network drive for them. What else can I do to make someone understand this very simple concept?

                              <span>Dear r/sysadmin
 I was givin the task to implement S/MIME. Yet, never done that before.
 I know that after some research, that every E-Mail Adress needs to be signed for encryption.
 We have roughly 150 Clients which just need to communicate to a single entity (some gov. agency). Altough the plans are to expand that in the future.
 Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do, we do not have a S/MIME Gateway (yet) and all we have atm. is an Exchange OnPrem (2013 , Update soon) and Outlook 2013/2016 on our Clients.
 I&#x27;m not sure where to start and where to go from here.
 &gt; Purchasing S/MIME Certs and distribute them on all of the Clients
 &gt; Letting a internal CA create User-Certs and use them to sign and just send the other entity the root CA.
 &gt; Implementing a S/MIME Gateway (NoSpamProxy?!) and hopefully Implement it smoothly.
 I am a bit over my head here and every guidance is more than welcome :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>We currently have a VNG for IPSec connections back to two of our on-prem data centers and just stood up an ExpressRoute VNG to a vendor&#x27;s network (same region). While BGP is working great for our IPSec VNG, how do I go about taking the BGP routes I&#x27;m receiving on the ExpressRoute connection from this vendor into the rest of our Azure environment?
 Trying to get the routes to propagate like our other BGP routes do from the IPSec VNG.
 I&#x27;ve tried setting up a peering from a VNet to this VNG but the routes don&#x27;t advertise.
 Sorry, kind of new to Azure routing..

                              <span>Is any one in here familiar with the ShowCollector Python script that is available for running show commands on IOS/NX-OS devices utilizing netmiko and Python? I am extremely novice to the Python world but was recently assigned a task of doing data collection on around 100 IOS switches so it’s not very feasible to manually SSH to all of them and run show commands, nor should it be. I need this done by the end of the week which is why I am trying to use this script that’s already published as I know I won’t have time to learn from the ground up by then.
 Anyways, I am not having issues running the script, I am able to run it fine and it “works,” but the account I have for access needs to pass the enable password which this script doesn’t account for, so whenever it tries to create a new file using the host name via ‘show running-configuration | i host name’ it just ends up not naming the files with a host name like it’s supposed to, and overwriting them because I can’t view the running config with my account. I have been trying for a couple of hours to modify the code to allow the enable password, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. I was able to create a very basic script and use net_connect.enable() which worked for passing the enable password, but was only ran on one device and didn’t export the output to a file which is needed. After I was able to get that working, I tried adding that bit and the enable password into the ShowCollector code in multiple different areas, but ultimately couldn’t get it to work, and now I am stuck on where to add the parameters which is why I am here lookin to get some pointers/ideas on where to look! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve come across some inconsistencies across vendors on how RSTP and RPVST interact and was wondering if anyone else deploys both to the same device or if you just default to RPVST.
 For context I the device is a 100G access switch(Arista) for some devices in research cluster. This device carries only a couple of VLANs. Management, node management, node uplinks(LACP) are pretty much it. I have both turned on ATM and see no issues but I&#x27;d rather take my chances. It will eventually become a dual switch setup in MLAGs if I ever get the sister switch delivered... T.T

 I&#x27;m not sure which sub best fits this question, but I&#x27;m trying to determine what this device is that&#x27;s on my network. I first noticed the device when I added the new VLAN to my HP Aruba switch (SW02) and it grabbed an address from DHCP. Trying to determine which port it was plugged into, I ran: show mac-address on the switch and it showed that the device was connected to the trunk port, so I SSH&#x27;d into the switch that the trunk port runs to (SW01) and ran the same command, it came back showing that the MAC was attached to port 3 which is the trunk port that runs to SW02. I&#x27;ve checked for the MAC on every other switch on my network, as well as DHCP for all VLANS, the only place I can find this MAC address is on SW02 trunk port, and SW01 trunk port that runs to SW02.
 Device details …</span>

                              <span>I am working on a fail-over for a 2nd campus that normally gets its internet from our main campus via a site-to-site fiber link. We want Campus B to be able to fail-over to a new local ISP in case the site-to-site fiber goes down. 
 Please look over the basic diagram:
 https://imgur.com/a/nmMNkDW
 ​
 The SonicWall NSA and ISP at Campus B are new additions.
 We want all Internet to go out Campus A unless there is a break between campuses, then Campus B can fail-over to its ISP.
 OSPF is in use for sharing routes about various VLANs hosted on the L3 switches and the NSA at Campus A. 
 The NSA at campus A does not inject the default route into OSPF.
 I was initially going to just add a static route to the Meraki Layer 3 switch at Campus B with a metric to make it 2nd choice, but it can&#x27;t set a metric for a static route.
 Should we inject the default route from the NSA at Campus A into OSPF, add NSA at Campus B to OSPF, and inject its default route and set that as a lower priority?

                              <span>I recently learnt about the Transmission Control Block, or TCB, and I&#x27;m wondering what this means when a packet is actually forwarded from a computer&#x27;s NIC or how do we use TCB and create.
 Example, Initially, as soon press enter, that the time we will build the packet which include the source(From DHCP or Static), destination (from DNS), and port information. however, the TCB also manages the connection at this point and we get the TCB/Socket information similar on how we build a packet.... So, could you please confirm that we first build the TCB that holds the socket information before actually forwarding the traffic to the nic? Is it possible to connect this during the layer-by-layer processing of the packet in the OSI representation?
 Per research, we can say TCB is the Netstat? 
 Sorry if my question is confusing, but I simply need to know how important TCB and how packets are processed with it.

                              <span>Hello fellow network nerds! :-) For many years I have been helping to send out RIPE Atlas measurement probes (world&#x27;s largest open Internet measurement platform) in the US - initially a few hundred as IPv6 deployments happened. There are currently ~1,400 active probes in the US. But with some newer ISPs there are gaps that would be cool to fill - initially newer ISP connections like Starlink and 5G fixed wireless (TMo &amp; Vz). (Next year maybe some rural FTTH ISPs.)
 In my day job[1], I just renewed our RIPE Atlas sponsorship which gives me another block of probes to deploy. If you might be interested in hosting a probe on your connection, I am guessing I will have probes be able to ship them in about a month (given the upcoming IETF meeting starting this weekend). Once you receive a probe, it connects to your network via Ethernet and you will need to use the RIPE Atlas site to activate the probe – which is about 5 mins work.
 If you might be interested, please PM with the following info: Your first &amp; last name, your shipping address, and your email address for probe activation process.
 Don’t know what RIPE Atlas is? See https://atlas.ripe.net/ 
 Thanks! Jason
 [1] Day job is at Comcast where I work on Internet measurement and new standards and lots of other good-of-the-Internet sorts of stuff. This RIPE Atlas system is run by RIPE NCC - all I am doing is facilitating distribution of probes in the U.S. Here&#x27;s a somewhat recent paper I co-wrote about Internet measurement: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372135.

                              <span>I am trying to confirm if running a GRE Tunnel from a c8000v within azure can be successfully terminated to an on-prem c8500, via expressroute. I spoke to my azure consultant/sme to check if this was possible and he said he is doubtful that it is but he has been wrong a few times in the past with what is possible and what isn&#x27;t, so I do not want to take just his word. I have also done some research and I read that GRE is not supported in azure however I wanted to further vet this to be true before crossing this out as a possible option to enable an overlay for direct ebgp peering between my on-prem c8500 and cloud c8000v. Has anyone had any experience in deploying this, or is this even feasible? 
 Any comments/advice or know docs are much appreciated!

                              <span>Let me start with we are an Aruba and HPe environment. We also have an ISP Switched ethernet for 19 different sites and it is in working order. I have been in my position in charge of the network for the last year, I know enough to keep things running.
 However the ISP is dragging their feet on getting us information regarding information on when they can setup the Switched Ethernet line at a new site (this is just information).
 Sadly the current new site has a limit on time to be up and running (11/14/2022).
 My boss wants a &quot;point to point&quot; setup from the new network to ours. I was researching on a VPN pptp from our layer 3 to the current layer 3 in house, however, I find that the Aruba 2920-48G J9729A cannot do this.
 With that said, can I get some suggestions on how to do this?

                              <span>Does anyone work in this sector, particularly designing, implementing or administrating infrastructure in space? Is it the same as on the ground here or are things done differently in spacecraft? Would the topology be the same on say Mars compared to Earth? I was having this conversation with some of my colleagues today. I guess this is a sector that cloud can’t really take over…. right? 
 The inner kid in me feels like it would be such a worthwhile undertaking to be apart of.

 I&#x27;ve exhausted any logs from network equipment that might shed any light on this. 
 Basically looking for a tool that I can throw on a micro pc and leave in a closet. Connect to wifi. Then see a history of ping times, speed tests, and whatever other network statistics it can throw at me by date/time. 
 This way I can deploy these to trouble spots and maybe find some data to back up the claims so my NOC will actually listen to me.
 I admit my google-fu has been weak here. 
 Anyone have any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I found a contractor to run cable from my building&#x27;s MPOE where ATT trunk/ciena resides to my unit a couple floors up. Now we have two path options and I&#x27;m not sure which is more ideal so would like some perspective on best practices:
  
  
Path 
  
 1) Run in conduit from MPOE to a shared telco/electrical closet (one on each floor) then terminated in a splice tray/patch panel (not sure correct term) and then from closet down a zig zag hallway (drop ceiling) into our unit where I imagine it ends up in another termination box/splice try before being handed off to ATT BGW320 gateway with pigtails. This is the longer run of the two, but I guess more modular as the cable has more sections/splices.
  
 2) Second option is ran in conduit from MPOE through a shared stairwell straight to…</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 Fairly new to SDWAN. Regular client has QOS policies across all their LAN switches which is typical when using MPLS to help preserve voice/video traffic etc.
 With SDWAN, my understanding is that the devices will identify the traffic type and will do its own prioritization without the need to specifically mark traffic as EF on the LAN.
 Can you help me understand this please?

                              <span>I&#x27;m facing my first software upgrade on a 9800-L, 16.12.2(s) to 17.6. I&#x27;m primarlily an Aruba engineer, and not too familiar with the IOS XE series from Cisco, although I have some battle scars from the 2500-series.
 I&#x27;ve read the documentation, and while it&#x27;s very informative, I struggle to find answers for some of the basic principles. 
 My main question is wheter the AP&#x27;s require dedicated software images loaded, or if they will pull their software from the controller image named C9800-L-universalk9_wlc.17.06.04.SPA.bin. My understanding so far is that during an upgrade to new major release, AP images are included in the controller software.
 The other thing I&#x27;m questioning is which upgrade procedure is the most safe and efficient. I&#x27;m reading about SMU, hitless upgrade, ISSU etc. The customer does not have N+1, just a single controller. We have planned maintenance, so I&#x27;m not bothered with hitless upgrade etc. Should I just upload the .bin-file, select &quot;INSTALL&quot; mode and run the upgrade - that&#x27;s it?
 ​
 Appreciate any helpful advice!

                              <span>Mods, if this question isnt allowed please let me know.
 So I recently started a job as a network analyst (with no prior experience, but I&#x27;ve been taught some aspects and self taught with guides and a lot of google). I&#x27;ve noticed lately users keep letting me know their internet is dead, which is odd. Every single time this has happened so far (3 times) the vlan in my switch is showing a vlan that hasn&#x27;t been in use by this location for a long time. Is there any reason a switch would &quot;default&quot; or change the vlan on the running configuration without a user&#x27;s input? Obviously it&#x27;s not a big issue for me to change the vlan and watch the connection spring to life, but if there is something I&#x27;m missing I&#x27;d like to start getting ahead.

 I cant find any examples or anything when searching for it. 
 What I need is change the subscriber from one VRF to another after Radius Accept.

 I really liked the Tracy Kidder book called The Soul of a New Machine , and I was wondering if there was a similar type of book that covers the 1970s and 1980s and the Protocol Wars. Thanks .

                              <span>I recently saw an example of a pcap capture which shows an HTTP GET request to a legitimate .com TLD which was seen in the ‘Host’ header of the capture. However, I also noticed the ‘Referer’ field was to an unusual, possibly malicious .xyz TLD. 
 Do this mean the http GET request does not actually connect to the .com TLD but rather the malicious .xyz? I’m a bit confused on what the referer field is implying. 
 Thanks for any insight

                              <span>Work in the non-profit world, State funded. All of our switches have been EOL since 2017, ASA firewalls just went EOL. My manager isn’t in on buying all new hardware. She has the, “it’s working, why change it” mentality. How can I tackle this? Or do I just say okay, wait for it to shit itself, then move from there? 
 Disclaimer: We do have money to buy the equipment. We actually get tons of cash thrown at us from the state. Anything 5k or less is just an expense and written off. So I see no problem

I don&#x27;t put a lot of effort in, so maybe that is part of it, but I haven&#x27;t gotten many replies, despite being a senior sysadmin. 
 How big of a deal is it to fluff your resume? I don&#x27;t mean outright lie, but add a bit more than is technically truthful?
 Additionally, how often to you look at college vs no college? 
 I&#x27;m really pointing my career to Systems Engineering, rather than systems administration, so I was wondering if College is a big decider there.

                              <span>Hi r/sysadmin,
 We had our internal root CA certificate expire and it broke our NPS setup. We renewed the root CA and Windows clients are able to have the WiFi work if they get a gpupdate/force over a cabled connection but unfortunately, clients cannot get this over the WiFi. 
 Does anyone know how I can get a fix for this outside of creating another SSID or cabling all laptops to get a gpupdate with the new root CA. Is it possible to pull from the older expired cert and fix it?

                              <span>Our company has been down for a day and a half now thanks to a network issue with our IP phones (I won&#x27;t say the manufacturer, lets say there is a problem with My Telephones and leave it at that)
 It&#x27;s not with our network, it&#x27;s not with the telephone reseller, it&#x27;s a problem with the cloud providers internet routing. The engineers are working on it at the moment.
 Back in the old days of copper, even if the phone system was down, we&#x27;d still be getting phone calls on the main number where messages could be taken by receptionists and emails could be sent to people asking them to call certain customers back.
 Say what you want, I still reckon copper lines were more DR proof than IP phones. I miss copper telephone lines.

                              <span>Any recommendations for a router or l2/3 switch that can route a symmetrical 1 gbps line speed? I have a Aruba switch that can pass traffic from port to port at 1gbps, but when I use it to route I cant get above 400mbps. I have read other manufactures have the same problem.
 I am looking to simply route my lan traffic to my ISP hand off and vice versa. . Not interested in any software features except basic routing on the device. (Firewall does all the heavy lifting) 
 Ive seen ubiquiti, microtiks, and others noted. Any models or other brands I should look at? Not intrested in PFsense as i dont want any servers to deal with. Just small devices with a little onboard flash. 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve talked to some of these automation companies and it seems they have no incentive to create new automation controls.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m hoping someone can cast some light on what might be happening here in the Forwarders section of our DMARC reports:
 https://imgur.com/a/2H8JSy7
 It looks like well-known spammers (AdVids with their many domain variations) are somehow using our DKIM to pass DMARC alignment for their spam emails via Google forwarders. If so, I&#x27;m concerned about potential impact on our reputation, as well as how the heck that could be happening in the first place.
 Our DKIM keys for the 2 affected selectors are 2048-bit through Microsoft 365 and have been rotated 2 weeks in a row, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected this spam delivery in any way.
 We do also receive spam from these very domains, but when I look at the headers they&#x27;re all passing their own SPF/DKIM for their many domain variations, with no mention of our domain in SPF/DKIM.
 Any thoughts or insights would be very welcome, thanks.

They have been excellent helping me get comfortable in my new role as a solo &quot;IT Manager&quot; and monitoring our security and backups. The issue is they all work remote up and down the east coast. Besides a visa gc any good ideas that could be delivered via email and redeemed. Wonder if Total Wine has something. Any ideas would be much appreciated.

 It feels like we are trying to jump through a ton of hoops just to avoid using something that&#x27;s an industry standard, and the justifications just don&#x27;t make sense. It comes across as &quot;we know better than everyone else&quot;
 I&#x27;m a junior here so I can&#x27;t really say much but, have any of you encountered this? How did you handle it?

                              <span>I thought I&#x27;d share some key points from a talk I did on Shadow IT as it&#x27;s most often the sysadmins that have to battle with it.
 Tackling shadow IT is a never ending battle. You need to be vigilant and always looking for improvements.
 It&#x27;s a human problem if your company hires humans you have shadow IT
 Decreasing friction and improving the relationship between the service provider (You) and users is the most effective way to minimize shadow IT
 You need to understand what exists where through mechanisms that can&#x27;t be bypassed. Instead of importing your excel sheet of NetBIOS names into an asset inventory tool, scan all your IP ranges. You will be shocked by how much unknown stuff sits on your network.
 Tools like WDAC and App locker are great if your just starting to tackle the problem.
 Don&#x27;t villainize your self by snapping at users you catch with shadow IT. Understand why it exists and what you can do provide an appropriate alternative.
 Because your always going to have Shadow IT take a risk based approach and tackle the stuff those poses the most danger even if it&#x27;s easier to remove that weird app Janet in finance uses.
 Once you have a strong understanding of what&#x27;s in your consistency explore more &#x27;heavy handed&#x27; technologies like Network access control. You can use these technologies to mitigate while you solve the problem.

                              <span>So we received some marketing junk from Dell, but honestly it&#x27;s really cool. Came with a biometric padlock that will never get used as they are all a novelty. The cool part is this: https://imgur.com/a/qcL0JBH It came with this cool timer thing that actually has a little spiny countdown thing.
 The cool part is that although they are only using a small (3 inch) percentage of the screen, it&#x27;s actually a 7&quot; LCD panel with a little control board, battery, speaker and magnet switch: https://imgur.com/a/F7rm9Bt
 Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to find any info on the screen or the board (they do have numbers, but my google-fu couldn&#x27;t find anything) as I would love to &quot;hack&quot; this any actually repurpose it! Maybe throw my Nagios map on it. Anyone else get one of these boxes? I would show a pic of the box too, but it&#x27;s... a little torn up lol.

 I could use this apparently, but I don&#x27;t know what &quot;parserr&quot; is and if its 3rd party or not.

 Anyone have an easy solution for this?

                              <span>I need to make sure the details for each individual SIM card subscription are updated with the name of the person who the SIM is issued to. 
 In order to do this I need to find out the SIM details of each device in our organisation (some are voice and data connections, some are just data connections) so that I can then make sure the right name is assigned on our SIM provider portal.
 Is there any way to do this with InTune? Or will I have to manually collect every phone and inspect the SIM? 
 Thank you

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been having Teams crashes on Windows 7 since mid last week.
 Version 1.5.00.28567 crashes with &quot;A javascript error occurred in the main procees&quot;.
 Our current workaround is to launch Teams.exe from the Appdata/local/microsoft/teams/previous instead the default shortcut which uses Update.exe. This is getting deployed by GPO to users.
 We&#x27;ve tried clean installs, deleting folders and regkeys. Repairs and reinstalls of the C++ redists.
 Is anyone else experiencing this issue, and have you found a solution, or is Teams finally not supported on Windows 7?

Anyone come across any way to do this, so they can only use the internet if they&#x27;re on the local wifi, or if there is any other way to lock them down until they reconnect to the staff wifi? And yes I know, this is not ideal but this is one paranoid manager.

                              <span>The last time I had to set up a firewall for a customer with this they went out and bought an internet plan without telling us, ended up getting sold on the 10x more expensive &quot;dedicated internet&quot; and we had so much trouble configuring the WAN as opposed to regular cable/fiber service. The provider gave two WAN schemes and were insistent upon having to use both for the service to work, referring to one group as the &quot;LAN&quot;. I researched dedicated internet for some time and realized it is innately different than the usual internet service with shared pipes. 
 This was months ago but am seeing more events of customers signing up for this and then passing the buck to IT and it only being a problem once the cutover happens and nothing works as expected. The last thing I remember in first example was the provider suggesting I set up my &quot;LAN&quot; with this public scheme and basically NAT traffic from one scheme to the other to show outbound coming from their &quot;WAN&quot; scheme. 
 If not obvious already I feel I&#x27;m clearly missing something here: can anyone chime in on best practice to get this working as expected? Have set up countless networks and helped facilitate cutovers for businesses utilizing static WANs before, but this dedicated internet setup obviously involves more than just the WAN port config and bridge mode modem that had come to be the expectation. How do you configure this firewall side? Do you need additional physical equipment that the provider does not provide?

I was able to solve my problem with ZeroTier (similar to Hamachi), but I would like to create a virtual LAN using a USB-c to USB-c cable, for better speeds. Does anyone know of any software that works on both Mac and PC for creating a virtual LAN through a USB-c link?

The whole imaging process goes off without any problems but if a user is logged in and locks the computer, The lock screen doesn&#x27;t give the option to switch user. Is it a matter of enabling fast user switching or could something else be the issue?

                              <span>I work at an MSP where some clients are on Azure AD. A common call we receive is a user having account problems with their O365 applications. The apps either don&#x27;t sign in properly or the apps state it&#x27;s a license error.
 The resolution is very simply for us. We go into &#x27;Access Work or School&#x27;, select &#x27;Info&#x27; on the account, then scroll down and there should be a red message by the sync button stating the user needs to sign in to resolve an error. We re-authenticate and the problem is resolved.
 How can we implement some preventative measure for this issue, and/or make it so the user is given a prompt to re-authenticate when there is a sync issue. I know it&#x27;s such a simple process for us to navigate to Access Work or School but I feel like we could cut down the number of these type of calls.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 Have a change planned to add a few extra OUs to our Azure Sync through Azure AD Connect. We&#x27;ve had a number of 365 accounts be deleted and have realised after a bit of digging it&#x27;s because only limited OUs in our AD are syncing up.
 Process is fairly easy and I can&#x27;t envision any issues - however just want to triple-confirm (as can&#x27;t find any documentation that mentions it). If adding additional OUs (not removing any) - and a full import on the directory is performed on next sync cycle - will there be any outage or change expected for current users in 365?
 (Azure AD Connect -&gt; Customize syncronization options -&gt; Domain/OU Filtering -&gt; Sync Selected Domains and Users -&gt; Select all additional OUs)
 Being overly cautious, however figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to hear from somebody who has done this also, for peace of mind.

                              <span>Hi all, what antennas do you use for your LTE routers? I’ve been using taoglas guardian series, and they’re great, but I’ve found that their prices are a bit steep for what you get.
 Usage is on cradlepoint IBR series routers, only need for LTE (wifi disabled), the small router attached ones are not usable for my installations since the routers sit within steel boxes that acts pretty much like a faraday cage.

I haven&#x27;t been in it in awhile as there hasn&#x27;t been any problems and I never set my account for password to expire. Well my password expired and I cannot get in.... I normally RDP to the domain controller from there and make changes/create accounts as needed. The laptop I currently work on, is off domain from our actual domain and the Citrix domain. So my question is how do I get into the domain?

                              <span>I screwed up and updated the PCL6 type 3 driver for our Canon printers on our Windows print server to a newer version. Now nobody can print to the printers unless they update the driver first, and nobody can update the driver because they aren&#x27;t an administrator. Is there a way to push out a new driver version to all Windows 10 clients centrally without having to touch every laptop one at a time (with an admin account)? I&#x27;ve been out of the print management game for years (due to the pandemic and nobody being in the office) so I have completely spaced on how this is done. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>We are going to be re-IPing one of our datacenters and have an older NetApp SAN there that we need to change IPs on. The management interface seems straightforward, but there&#x27;s an SVM that we aren&#x27;t sure is actually in use...and if it is, it looks like we have to blow it away and re-create to change the IP scheme on it? We only have one production VM left on it, but blowing the SVM away is a little disconcerting. 
 - Do I actually need to blow away the SVM and re-create it to change the IP?
 - How can I tell if the SVM is actually used? There is traffic on the NICs assigned to it, so I&#x27;m guessing it is used, but some other proof would be nice.

                              <span>There are a few users who are getting bitten with the “my account is locked out every morning” bug. We’re hybrid, the account in O365 is fine when on-prem is locked. The usual tools and logs always point to bad password. User always claims it’s entered properly. Users are mobile, and the problems seem to occur on boot or waking up. OS is Windows 10.
 My current theory is that these lovely (/s) USB docks may be delayed in registering to Windows and identifying keyboards. And in that delay possibly the password, while being typed, isn’t keying in all the characters. Netwrix lockout auditor, DC event logs, etc, never show logon events from any other workstation, so I don’t believe it’s anything malicious. Our helpdesk is done with the problem, so it’s a sysadmin issue now. 
 My insane idea is to throw a keylogger on one of their laptops and capture what’s being typed when they have this issue. In order to see if I’m right about mistyped passwords being the culprit. Because I have a feeling if I call Microsoft, I’m going to be pissing away $500 and months of my time arguing with the level 1 crowd, and going nowhere. 
 If anyone has any other ideas, I’m game. 
 Sorry for the long post.

                              <span>I know we all have fair share of users who call you 24/7 just to come to clean their freaking mouse; users who can not for the life of them remember their passwords; but have you ever encounter users who argue with you about how they want IT things done using the excuse that they used to be in IT, their spouse, sisters, brothers, kids, dad, grand moms; their dogs used to work in IT?
 This morning I have a user yelled at me that they used to work as a graphic designer 20 years ago so I need to give them local admin rights to their corporate computer so they can download some shady software that they don&#x27;t want to disclose.
 I have to question myself. I am a 5 feet tall 100lbs Asian woman that looks 10 years younger than my age and work in a field that mostly for men. Is that why people think they have the rights to argue with me about how I do my own job? My boss told me not to take it personal but I can not help not to :(. I have been in IT for 3 years and have ran into this a lot.
 ​
 Sorry for the morning rant guys and ladies!!

                              <span>Hi everyone, my last role was two years ago as a vCIO and then I funded two businesses that are still going on but I don&#x27;t want to be in them anymore. I realized I can&#x27;t do the constant remote, the 13hs a day... I just can&#x27;t. 
 I&#x27;m an introvert, I like to think, strategize and implement. My background is in network security mostly and I like that a lot. I used that knowledge and some people skills to work selling equipment, and even though that is not what I love and where I thrive, I can do it if I need to. I quickly learn IT products and can explain how they work. 
 I went to a trade school, studied engineering, dropped out, and went to business administration while working at Net. Sec. - I like the IT world, I&#x27;m passionate about security and privacy but I also like the processes and structures where I can create a place for teams in businesses can work and can have success in what they do. I always jokingly called myself the architect of my businesses because I can easily connect or relate all the software, systems, and processes to make sense of it for the business and find ways to leverage all of them. And now I realize that&#x27;s kind of a career as well. 
 I would like to do something with my business experience and I was thinking Enterprise Architecture could be something interesting. I don&#x27;t want to go back to configure firewalls or anything really. I could sell, but I rather not. 
 Has anyone of you jumped and moved laterally like me? What&#x27;s your experience?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, I have noticed that google meet doesn’t cope with a closed lid on MacBook Pros regardless of MacOs version and hardware specs. Even a webcam with a builtin mic, keeps switching between macs mic and the webcam. From the fact that MacBook blocks microphone when the lid is closed. Please share your experience if you’ve had this issue

                              <span>Hi, I need to rejoin a bunch of users to an AD domain (domain controller is lost and they haven&#x27;t another one). 
 I never used Profwiz, which I believe is the correct tool, and I think I have a very basic question: I will need local administrator account on every workstation to be able to switch profile? I am asking this since I don&#x27;t think users will know their local password, probably I will need to reset them first. Thank you

                              <span>Hi, generally I use the original putty, and I open several sessions in screen when working on Linux servers. Anyway I found a bit annoying switiching between panels, I&#x27;d prefer to use some solution like SecureCRT to open multiple session to same server and easily switch tabs.
 ​
 SecureCRT is great since it allows to rapidly switch between sessions with Alt+1, Alt+2, and so on.
 MTPuTTY looks ok, but it seems can only allows to cicle between sessions (previous/next), it doesn&#x27;t allow to switch to session X for example.
 What your favorite tool, if you use any? Thankyou

                              <span>Now, we&#x27;ve all had issues with spam E-Mails.
 Be it a non-CAPTCHA&#x27;d PHP E-Mailer on an old web-server or the daily LinkedIn Bots messaging you with corporate propaganda, we all get bad mails from time to time.
 ​
 However, one of the worst feelings I&#x27;ve had experienced in my company is realizing that 90% of the E-Mails we send out land in people&#x27;s spam folders. We do not send out bulk E-Mails, each Mail is and was handwritten, often included very long explanations and resources that never saw the light of day. That is frustrating.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve found this website: https://mail-tester.com/ which is very helpful in testing whether your E-Mail gets marked as spam and why! You SHOULD absolutely check it out and test an E-Mail just like you&#x27;d send to business partners and clients.

                              <span>Howdy everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve been im a Helpdesk role for 14 months now and want to better prepare for moving into a system admin role. There is so much to learn, what does everyone recommend I focus on to build a better foundation?
 For context about were I feel Im at skill wise I set up new users with AD, handle most of the day to tech issues, do basic server work, like connecting ports and sorting out tape back ups. I maintain VBS scripts for deploying signatures and printers (but couldnt write my own). And I&#x27;m trying to study the new server architecture and learn powershell currently.
 I&#x27;m keen to keep learning, but I know the day will come when my boss steps away from taking on the sys admin role and if he feels like he cant rely on me and hires someone else, it would really hit hard

                              <span>There&#x27;s a simple and effective command to remove any empty (sub)directories within a given directory (&quot;dir1&quot; in the example):
 robocopy &quot;dir1&quot; &quot;dir1&quot; /s /move 
 However, it turns out robocopy is removing all the attributes of the folders (R - Read only; S - System; H - Hidden) if any, except A (Archive).
 So, the question is as in the title: is there a way to make the target folders keep all the attributes of the source folders?
 NB any robocopy /DCOPY flags somehow don&#x27;t help here

 After some advice, we have a client that is running an RDS farm, they have users that are licensed for Adobe Acrobat Pro and some that dont.
 I see Adobe have stripped us of installing Reader and Pro side by side, installing Acrobat works until a user signs in and it auto upgrades to Pro, rendering the application useless for everyone that is unlicensed.
 What are other SysAdmins doing here, or can this simply not be done anymore. :(
 Any help much appreciated!

                              <span>I am deploying several PHP websites on the same server. Mostly Laravel and WordPress projects.
 How much of a security vulnerability would it be to use the same MySQL user credentials in each project&#x27;s .env file?
 My guess is that I should use a unique username and password for each database. Credentials which I don&#x27;t actually need to memorize since at the end of the day I always have root access to my databases.
 One project&#x27;s .env might look like:
 DB_DATABASE&#x3D;foobar DB_USERNAME&#x3D;frankzappa DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;g4HEs45m220x 
 Whereas another project&#x27;s .env would look like:
 DB_DATABASE&#x3D;goobar DB_USERNAME&#x3D;jimihendrix DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;t3sy47sd3ts3 
 So, in your opinion, what is the best practice when it comes to deploying multiple dynamic websites on the same server?

                              <span>After setup Cisco switch to authenticate with AD/RADIUS I can not login with the local account. Is this how it should be. 
 Like to have the breakglass acc in case there is network or AD issue.

                              <span>r/sysadmin patch megathread mentions that TLS 1.0 will be disabled by the 2022-10 patches on 2012r2 devices. This will, if I understand correctly, prevent the Connection Broker service from connecting to the WID database. Microsoft suggest upgrading (!!!) or moving to SQL for the Connection Broker (!!! again) OR re-enable TLS 1.0 (see Remote Desktop service (RDS) Connection Broker or Remote Desktop Management service (RDMS) fails - Windows Server | Microsoft Learn ) but they don&#x27;t specify how to re-enable TLS 1.0
 I&#x27;m asking what the best way to do that is - I believe it&#x27;s a combination of registry keys but I&#x27;ve seen differing recommendations as to what keys are required.

                              <span>Hi there
 I thought that if anyone had the answer to this it&#x27;ll be the r/sysadmin community
 I&#x27;m looking to backup around 2TB of files from a Linux server, I want to upload the files to a storage site &amp; download them later all purely through Linux commands
 I thought of Google Drive at first then quickly found out it has 750GB/day limit on bandwidth
 So now I&#x27;m kind of hesitating about using OneDrive
 What&#x27;s the best storage site u know of that has large bandwidth?

                              <span>Can anyone tell me what would cause a handful of Outlook 2016 clients to use basic authentication when connecting to Exchange Online while MA is turned on for our tenant?
 We had several users lose connectivity in Outlook after basic auth was disabled. My fix ended up being to change EnableADAL key to a value of 1, but can’t understand why these clients were opting to use basic auth to begin with?
 My understanding is that 2016 should default to MA, unless explicitly told to use legacy via registry keys. 
 I’ve been reading/researching for hours now and see a few similar questions, but no answers.
 Edit: a word
 Edit 2: A) is the enableADAL key added to the registry automatically when installing Office 2016? If so, is there anything other than manual intervention that would set the value to 0? If not, how does this key get added to the registry other than manually?

                              <span>Company is slowly expanding into a new location. The facility is huge and has been vacant for a few years now but still maintained (to an extent).
 Thankfully some of the guys from the previous IT team were nice enough to provide any and all of their documentation. I still have a lot to go through but I was immediately impressed by not just WHAT they documented but HOW they documented it.
 This made me realize that while it is widely agreed that documentation is critical it has never been anything I&#x27;ve been taught or even shown how to do. Several times over the years I&#x27;ve felt there were better ways I could be doing my documentation but when trying to research methods or templates I would get nowhere.
 Obviously there is the catch that to show how you format and do your documentation you would have to either censor all of your actual data or take the time to input dummy data. Curious to see how you guys are able to explain or even demonstrate HOW you do your documentation.
 PS - Drink every time I said &quot;documentation&quot;

                              <span>Currently a senior system administrator, and I’m finding myself more and more in a position where things are just nonstop a shit show. I’m trying to work on real life projects, I’m literally designing networks, putting servers together and deploying them for real businesses, and then I find myself caught in a shitstorm of Level 1 Level 2 bullshit tickets. 
 My company does not wanna hire L1’s, so we’re basically a bunch of senior sysadmins having to deal with Morons that can’t Google their goddamn problem. Ticket after ticket after ticket, as projects Pile the fuck up. You ignore it and the customers whine and complain. 
 How do you guys deal with the stress? Because I feel like my health is slowly declining because of my ABSURD Stress levels due to this, and I’m only in my 20’s. The money is great but what’s the point if you don’t get to enjoy it because everyday is stress 9000? 
 Any advice from the wise ones is appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious what the consensus is on blocking emails with a SPF soft fail. SPF is a simple thing that can protect the sender and recipient. I see too many spoofed emails coming in that fail on soft to feel comfortable about letting them all in, but also see too many that haven&#x27;t taken a few minutes to configure one.

 You may then check the compatibility list and find your processor on it like I did. You may even find previous reports of the 6226 processor being bugged.
 Don&#x27;t worry your not going insane, the compatibility checker is just broken but fear not you can bypass it with the following registry key. Create the following a DWORD registry with a Value of 1 to bypass this faulty check and allow for upgrading.
  DWORD: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup\AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU 
 Hope this helps someone else save a week of their time.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I don’t do social media much so sorry if my post super stinks but I’m grasping at straws with this.
 Got a 300-400 user environment with multiple DCs. This morning the entire company got locked out of their accounts from the AD. Logging was turned on and the 4740 ID shows that everyone was locked out by account: DomainController$ and the call computer is “?”
 There were no Bad passwords logged.
 It’s in a hybrid 365 environment and azure ad does not see anything related to these lockouts.
 Anyone have any leads on where to look for a global lockout?
 Thanks for your time :)

                              <span>My IT org is pushing hard to get ISO 27001 certified and I’m all for it, but I’m having trouble figuring out wtf that even means.
 I’ve seen the 2013 and 2019 revisions and I can’t seem to find any good references to what the IT org is asking for. All of the ISO stuff looks very generic and non-specific.
 For example, IT org says we need keycard entry into the server room. Ok great we have that. But to me it looks like the point of ISO is that you create a policy, you test it, and you stick to it. I don’t see where I’m ISO it say you need keycard access. The policy of my company doesn’t say you need a keycard access either.
 So is the gap that my company doesn’t have a policy that says you need keycard access or am I missing the something?
 EDIT: I’m just a cog in the machine trying to understand a high-level view of the process. By no means did I intend to imply I was managing this project or writing policies.

                              <span>I work for a financial company and about a year ago, our security team put a policy in place to forensically image every computer used by a previous employee. We use various cloud platforms to back up the important stuff, but they set this up to get every thing on the local machine “just in case” 
 It is incredibly time consuming and in constant need of attention or process change due to OS updates or our MDM applying new policies, and that the software/devices perform very intermittently. 
 We use Cellebrite digital collectors (MacQ) for our Mac and Windows computers. Apple is already more difficult to navigate with this, and we still cannot obtain full images from M1 macs. I run into constant issues with the software freezing/crashing and, without any issues, the image can take anywhere from 1-5 hours to complete, so coupled with these issues, I can spend days working on these and make very little progress. 
 Since starting this work, I don’t believe even one file has ever been booted with an actual need to find something. 
 I am having a hard time seeing exactly why we need to have these images. With all the systems in place to record an employee’s work and the machines activity, I just don’t see how booting these images up later can be too useful. When researching, it seems like I am in a pretty narrow use-case, and it seems like there would be better tools and documentation if this was a larger and needed operation. But, maybe it’s the standard and I just have to keep pushing to get this into a good flow. 
 How does your org handle this?

                              <span>Our email signature isn&#x27;t overpowering... but the images in it are often causing annoyances when those who don&#x27;t have HTML enabled cause them to become attachments. I was asked to redesign our standards since they are over 3 years old.
 We currently have:
 Name
 Title
 Logo (300px wide)
 Address
 Phone Numbers
 Social Media
 ​
 I&#x27;d like to completely remove the social media images and just have the website. I am considering hosting the logo on our website, so we no longer have the attachments. Any other suggestions? Is the hosting of the logo on the website not a good idea?

                              <span>I just started my new sysadmin job (finally away from help desk!) and I&#x27;m now responsible for managing New Relic for my company. Both of these apps are new to me.
 I&#x27;ve been getting alerts from one of our web servers having over 80% space used. I checked it out and it looks like that New Relic is currently using up 16GB of logs in &quot;C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\Logs&quot;. I have a feeling this probably isn&#x27;t necessary.
 Two questions:
  
Is there any way to enable some kind of log rotation here? It looks like we&#x27;re using the .Net agent. After scouring the documentation for hours, all I can find is info on how to do this for the Java agent. Is there no way to set this up with the .Net agent? If so, how?
 If log rotation isn&#x27;t a thing for the .Net agent. Would I be safe in archiving (or deleting) most of these logs? Would this effect our New Relic instance?

                              <span>Hi all,
 This is such a niche topic so I apologise that I am trying to find a needle in a haystack here, but I have some Alcatel Lucent 8028 phones authenticating using 802.1x. They send their certificates to my Cisco ISE server, but the certificate chain is incomplete so they get rejected (as they should!).
 All I need is to acquire the root cert for Alcatel &quot;Wired Phones&quot;, but this appears to be much harder than it should be. I have found the below in a forum:
  
The certificates from the Alkatel business portal doesn&#x27;t work as these are not the correct CA&#x27;s signed the certificate of the phone. You have to obtain the correct CA &quot;Wired Phones&quot; from your Alkatel local vendor. 
  
Does anyone happen to have obtained this certificate? And if they have, can they please share it? 
 Thank You

                              <span>I have a firewall and two linux servers. I would like to aggregate the logs in a central location, run some basic analysis to identify potential issues and, ideally, be alerted when issues are identified. I realize a full SIEM implementation is probably beyond my budget and pay grade but would like to improve our logging and use of our logs. My goal is to reduce the amount of time I spend inspecting logs on 3 different machines.
 One server is remote and should connect via TLS, the firewall and other server are on the same local network I wish to implement the log server. I prefer opens source on windows but I am willing to consider a Linux based solution as well. Spending a little money is an option if the feature justify the expense but I really don&#x27;t have a budget for this.
 I&#x27;ve discovered there are a plethora of tools ranging from simple log servers to full SIEM available with a dramatic range in prices. I would really appreciate it if someone could help steer me in a good direction to help me understand what people enjoy using and find appropriate for small environments like mine. I imagine, like in many other areas of IT, there are certain tools that get used a lot and have more active communities. Thanks!

 I have been asked to create a folder to be mapped as a drive for our quality department. The quality department needs to be able to add files to the folder but not be able to delete or edit the files. What permissions do I have to set on the quality security group to accomplish this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>How does this stuff genuinely get past policies? I dont have any experience in government IT but surely they would have DLP policies and visibilities to stop stuff like this happening? Is it me being naive and theres probably a layer of corruption in there (most definitely), perhaps it was raised internally then dismissed with con consequences?
 It doesnt require expensive software to have the visibility or awareness of an incident like this. Does anyone have some insights to GOV IT and how this was even allowed?

                              <span>Boss wants popups on certain desktops to remind users to clock in and out. I have the logon message working - easy regedit. But how do I create a logoff reminder to clock out? Or something similar. Maybe a scheduled task 5 minutes before closing time? The challenge there is, some locations stay later than others due to volume.
 Is anyone doing something like this? How did you do it?

                              <span>I missed the memo about DLP being deprecated in August, and because we&#x27;re a standard O365 org (not E3 or E5) we can only get a 90 day trial of the new version (Purview)
 All I need to do is change the recipient address on some alerts that are set up (I&#x27;ll be changing it to a distribution list instead of named individuals).
 Will signing up for the 90 day trial allow me to make the changes and then forget about it? Or will it all just stop working then? Can it be worked around via Powershell? Am I totally scuppered?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>This is for Macs. Most Zscaler deployment tutorials have you download the .app file and converting that to a .pkg, but it looks like Zscaler has a .pkg file that you can download. I&#x27;ve tried deploying it but it just stays pending for a while before erroring out. 
 Anyone have any luck deploying the app?

 I am wondering if it also affects Connectors. I had legacy clients that stopped working a few weeks ago and the answer was to get the upgraded to a newer Outlook client. And that was easy enough.
 However, I am relaying through a report server to O365. It has worked well. Will this also be turned off?

                              <span>Hello. I got a customer service (mostly phone calls) job 2 months ago, and I want to travel abroad temporarily while being able to work. Here&#x27;s the setup already:
 ​
  
I&#x27;m using VMWare Workstation to avoid pesky/obtrusive software from accessing my PC
 The employer made me install &quot;Remote Desktop&quot;. So now I&#x27;m controlling the VMWare and then again through &quot;Remote Desktop&quot; to access the organization&#x27;s remote desktop.
  
How would I go about working during my trip? They don&#x27;t allow foreign IP addresses or VPNs. Therefore, the only option is to use a remote control desktop tool such as AnyDesk, Remote Desktop or TeamViewer. This would make the entire thing 3 layered:
 Layer 1: controlling my laptop from foreign country with another laptop
 Layer 2: using VMware on my remote laptop
 Layer 3: using Remote Desktop to access their remote desktop
 Any thoughts? I&#x27;ll be testing before the trip to ensure it works, but any feedback would be much appreciated.

 I know you can enable meeting room bookings from outside but it doesn&#x27;t provide the external with the Room Scheduler and I need that.
 So put another it another way; I want to book meeting rooms in an MS tenant I am not a part of and it has to ve user-friendly.

                              <span>Hey, 
 we have a terminal server with office and a shared computer licence installed. After some kind of bug, office had to get reinstalled. Now after reinstallation I thought that every user needed to have their mailboxes reconfigured with password entry and so on. However every user can access every mailbox again. Are these information stored somewhere in the userprofile, even after deinstallation of office? 
 I would have thought that every mailbox and password would have been deleted but it wasnt the case.
 Thanks for the help in advance

                              <span>Hi all, currently developing a risk assessment for IT/Cyber Security for the education sector. 
 I&#x27;m using NIST as a framework but wondered if anyone had any pointers or similar Risk Assessments? Needs to be inclusive of risks but not as heavy as what you may find in a corporate environment.

I checked the domain controllers I don&#x27;t see any errors I thought it might have been a sync issue between them but I don&#x27;t see that. Wondering if anyone had any suggestions? Thank you

                              <span>One of my managers told me that SCEP/NDES is dead. And we should focus on cert enrollment using another protocol, though he couldn&#x27;t tell me what it should be. We&#x27;re working on renewing network equipment and creating a list of modern applications to replace a lot of outdated stuff.
 Already told him that while I agree that SCEP/NDES is old, its anything but obsolete. If only when using MS ADCS.
 Obviously there&#x27;s modern protocol, next to custom REST API, such as EST, CMPv2 and ACME
 Me and my colleague find it pretty challenging to get a list of known brands/applications that actually still support SCEP/NDES based certificate requests, as well as those that support EST, CMPv2. 
 A lot of CISCO solutions support EST (such as ISE), but hopefully some of you in this community can help me with other applications/network equipment that supports SCEP/NDES, EST, CMPv2?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Recently took over a site and their VC provider has told us our CVI BlueJeans is coming up for renewal. 
 Currently all our meeting rooms have been upgraded to dedicated Yealink MTR over the last year with no legacy devices remaining. 
 I questioned this as in my mind, if our devices are native Teams MTRs then why would we need a bridge but the response was it is needed for any external parties joining from older devices. 
 &quot; The tenancy hosting the teams meeting must have the tenancy with the gateway. It won’t work if a guest has the gateway.&quot;
 ​
 Is that correct? 
 ​
 thanks,

 sh $ last | perl -wlane &#x27;print $F[2]&#x27; | sort | uniq  
 This time it worked nicely.

                              <span>Hi!
 Simple domain, server 2016 Standard, about 70 Win10&#x27;s (Pro) - they want bitlocker enabled on all of them (including the DC?) and are spread around several locations (hence why I&#x27;d like this to be silent)
 What is the best way to do this now? I&#x27;ve read that they have taken away the silent-option for non-enterprise editions and I see several PS-scripts on spiceworks and whatnot, but I don&#x27;t know which one is the best one to use.
 And while we&#x27;re at it, is storing the keys in AD the most safe/reliable approach? (Haven&#x27;t done that before.)
 Thanks in advance! :)

 Running kind of low on ideas, I would like to have two rows on my start menu, to link it out for people in my org. My google-fu is not treating me right. Has anyone ever done something like this and could shed some light on this? 
 This is what I would like to achieve:

                              <span>Due to reasons such as a better overview and security I&#x27;m planning on having two seperate systems.
 One for games and stuff, where for example it can&#x27;t be outruled that from time to time something like a mod gets downloaded from a less trustworthy website. The other one shall be for working and for important as well as sensitive data.
 Windows will run on both.
 But how do I seperate these systems? From what I&#x27;ve read, dual boot doesn&#x27;t really increase safety: If maleware makes it onto one system, it&#x27;s likely to infect all connected partitions and hard drives.
 Does using BitLocker for the respective partitions/hard drives improve security?
 Switches for 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; sata-drives exist, but I&#x27;d rather not downgrade from my currently used M.2-ssd.
 Is there any other option than using two seperate computers? How do you handle this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently running three Windows Server VM&#x27;s for a small business running some accounting software. Two of them are D4s v3&#x27;s (4 vCPU + 16GiB RAM), and the last is a B2s (2 vCPU + 4 GiB RAM). There&#x27;s a reservation in place which brings the monthly bill to approximately C$650 (US$476). This is getting a bit too expensive, especially considering that we&#x27;d like to add another VM. From looking at the bill, it seems that the main cost is the Windows Server VM License cost. Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.
 ​
 Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to? Or is this license cost going to exist everywhere? I&#x27;ve looked into it and saw that big names such as GCP have similar price ranges, whereas relatively unknown companies like Kamatera have cheaper prices. I&#x27;d appreciate any input.

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I have been working for one year at a company in the medical production business and the business has been growing rapidly for the past years. Last year we doubled in size and now we are about 100 users.
 ​
 I used to be working at a MSP as a consultant doing it all (from fixing printers to setting up servers). Im not great at anything but i have a broad knowlage base to stand on. I worked for this customer and they hired me as a IT-Manager last year. I am currently alone doing everything IT-related for the business.
 ​
 Now they want me to present a 5 year roadmap for IT and as this is a first for me i wanted to get your feedback on whats important to add to the presentation?
 ​
 My first thoughts are 
  
IT-Security withing the company and how to educate users (its almost non existant, before me there was no MFA, no general knowlage about security, no password on the company wifi etc).
 How to reduce costs
 Documentation
 Going Cloud (started to tamper with intune for easier computer management)
  
​
 Everything is helpful :)

                              <span>We are starting up Duo in our enterprise. We rely on Google&#x27;s Single Sign-on to be used with a service already for most of our users. So we use the Third-Party SSO Profile for that service. However a portion of users need to use MFA.
 To do this I set up Generic SAML Service Provider - Single Sign-On, and applied it to the OU where the users will be. On Google&#x27;s side, I also set &quot;Have Google Prompt for their username&quot; on the SSO Profile assignment. If I use &quot;Require users to enter their Google Username&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t prompt for MFA. 
 When signing into Google, I get a typical Google login page. After putting in the username, it then dumps me to Duo&#x27;s login page, prompting me to put the username in again. 
 Is there any way I can change that behavior so that Google passes the account name to Duo so my users don&#x27;t have to type the username in twice?

                              <span>Hello Gurus
 We are looking at getting 100M symmetric for one of our sites in Lewisville. Looking at Spectrum and Frontier. They both look similar cost wise.
 Any ideas who is better in these aspects Availability Support Speed to delivery
 Also thinking of a secondary link, any ideas on who can provide best business grade asymmetric internet?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been using EVE-NG on VMware for a few months and today when I started the virtual machine as always but today started with this messages. About the top warning one, I never had such problem with it, the first time it appears and the second one in the low part I don&#x27;t know what it means.
 And when I login on Eve website my machines in labs won&#x27;t start up, so I thought it could be a RAM issue, but it can&#x27;t be that because these exact machines always started with any kind of problem and if I give more RAM the virtual machine won&#x27;t start.

                              <span>So i have a lenovo ix2 NAS at work, suddenly for some reason i can no longer access it using its static ip via a browser.
 When i connect it directly with a cable to my work computer i can access it through a browser through its name only, not the ip.
 I checked the network settings, everything is still the same, same static ip, same subnet same everything, web access is also on.
 Anyone got any idea what could be the problem? Is it possibly something related to my network’s firewall?

                              <span>Looking to find documentation on using the same RSA keypair for different CA (trustpoints). I tested it by building ikev2 p2p tunnels and placing both trustpoints in the ikev2 profile and it worked. Also after establishing the connection I removed one of the trustpoints clear the sa session and connection reestablished on the 2nd trustpoint. My question is will it be a ipsec conflict using the same rsakey pair for different CA?

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading a networking book and I&#x27;m stuck on a sentence that suggests a circuit switched network divides its transmission rate depending on the number of connections/circuits. Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.
 In the TDM, you&#x27;re switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn&#x27;t go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you&#x27;re not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it&#x27;s a if the network is slower, but when you&#x27;re sending data, you&#x27;re sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don&#x27;t understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it&#x27;s a if the link speed is reduced?
 In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You&#x27;re dividing the spectrum, but you&#x27;re sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?

                              <span>Were currently contemplating on renewing our internal WLAN AP. One reason being, making the &quot;conenction faster&quot;. Sure we can do that with channel bonding and maybe thinking about implementing Wifi6 but we want to figure out if our internet connection is sufficient for user experieince. 
 ​
 How would one go about or how would you investigate to see if your internet connection is enough for your users? meaning if X amount of jitter, X amount of ping latency is enough or needs improvement and what not.

                              <span>Hi all!
 Here&#x27;s a bit of a confusing situation for me. I&#x27;m working with a pair of Cisco Nexus 3048-TPs running software version version 6.0(2)U2(2) which were given to me, and I&#x27;m attempting to configure the switches with a handful of SVIs, and with RIPv2 for the dynamic routing protocol (it&#x27;s a lab environment, don&#x27;t worry). I&#x27;m having issues with the behavior of the SVIs / L3 functionality on the switches.
 To start, let&#x27;s assume SVI #1 is for VLAN10 with the subnet 192.168.10.0/25 and the SVI has the IP address 192.168.10.1/25 and lives on Switch #1, and SVI #2 is for VLAN11 with the subnet 192.168.10.128.0/25 with the SVI having the IP address 192.168.10.129/25 living on Switch #2. RIPv2 is used to distribute routes for these subnets across the network. I also have a router at 10.1.0.1…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a direct fiber internet connection that comes in via a media converter as VLAN 35. However, the location where this fiber and media converter are located only has one network cable in that area which services some other equipment already. The simplest solution to pipe the internet connection to the router and firewall (on another level) would be to comingle the unsecured, unfirewalled internet connection on VLAN 35 with the rest of the LAN (that currently doesn&#x27;t use VLANs) on that one single cable. However, that seems counter intuitive. Usually I would prefer to physically have the router/firewall between the internet and the rest of the LAN, and not just virtually. Can VLANs be trusted to virtually separate the internet from the rest of the LAN? Or am I asking for trouble?

                              <span>Whenever I look up the benefits of http3, I see mostly the fast connection starts and the faster handling of errors. However, it seems to me that using udp instead of udp, would increase the speed of downloads substantially. For instance, if your ping is 100ms and your windows size is 32KB, then you are limited to 2.4Mbps to wait for the ack packet to come back. If you don&#x27;t have to wait for the ack packet, couldn&#x27;t you get the full network speed download of 1gbps (assuming that is what you pay for and the server also pays for that upload). That is a huge difference in bandwidth. Am I missing something?

                              <span>I have been a Network Administrator/Engineer for 10 years in a campus and data center environment. Only been at 2 employers in this time frame. I&#x27;ve never done any MSP or ISP networking in that time either. I have a great work/life balance right now and my employer is pretty good. I have 2 in office days and the other 3 are virtual days. Work only takes up maybe 4 hours of my average day, and nothing is too challenging right now to me. My team is about 6 network admins and a manager. Medium size environment. 
 I&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;m getting bored where I&#x27;m at now. I&#x27;ve been thinking about making a move to something else. I&#x27;m looking at cloud networking, or maybe something virtual like NSX. I&#x27;ve worked with NSX about 5 years ago but I don&#x27;t know how much since then it may have changed, or if it&#x27;s even still something orgs are using. Is there anyone in these jobs who wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing what an average day is? Are you work from home, hybrid, or in office? What&#x27;s the work/life balance in your job?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I had searched this question earlier, but didn&#x27;t get a convincing reply. And today i was asked this question and couldn&#x27;t answer. :( Could you please help with specific answers?
 Two scenarios:
  
Area1 &gt; Area0 &gt; Area2 &gt; Area1: Area 1 and 2 have direct connectivity using an ABR. Will Area 1 routes be advertised into Area 2 through the common ABR? If yes, will it cause any routing loop? If No, How will OSPF avoid the loop?
 Area 1 &gt; Area 2 using two ABRs. There is no Area 0. Will the routes be advertised between Areas? If yes, will it cause routing Loops? If No, how will OSPF prevent the loop?
  
I know Inter Area OSPF works like Distance vector (As per many answers i found on other posts), but still not clear how OSPF avoids loops in above scenarios.
 Thanks.

Do you have a backup plan incase went south and you forget the stories?
 Has anyone in this room not had an offer? What do you believe you can alter or fix to change that?
 What important question should we ask or know with the interviewer? 
 Mind sharing tips in passing ?

Terraform was my next bet but Meraki doesn&#x27;t have a provider. So, any suggestions on a tool/tools to automate/manage my network stack? I&#x27;d prefer to use the same tool for all network gear. I manage 3 sites so consolidating and automating management is ideal.
 I see Ansible looks to have collections for each and they both have python SDKs. Both of those tools I would like to use and learn more of. Maybe a preference of python but I could imagine how Ansible could be better for the job.
 Any suggestions? Other tools to use? Personal experiences? Bummed we leverage Meraki but it is what it is.

                              <span>Hello gents,
 you may find this a funny story, but I started recently to work for a data center provider in Europe. Initially, we were not carrier neutral so we had been trying to resell the internet traffic we purchased from tier 1-2 carriers to our clients as our own service. I mean it works well, as long as the customers aren&#x27;t the smartest ones and are ready to pay for it. 
 As I am one of the most experienced guys when it comes to carrier network (even thought I am in telco and carrier sales for more than 15 years) they now asking me to develop and establish 2 new products.
  
Become a carrier neutral DC
 Develope a Business Plan for a IP transit product
  
Regarding the first task.
 I am fine with it, as this had been my key business my entire career. The challenge is: They want me to offer these services (carrier neutral) only to the new clients, but not to the existing ones. So they want carriers to join, but will not allow them to approach existing customers, which is nonsense. IMHO. Why should carriers join us if they are not able to do their business and with whom? I need to write a business plan for that and maybe anybody has any kind of templates or something I can use, I would really appreciate it. 
 Regarding the IP Transit Product.
 I need to write a business plan and present it - even though, again, I am not a product designer nor manager, I used to be sales all my 15 years in DC Business. But that&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t have any choice. So any plans how I can start? 
 Thanks in advance...
 PS: Sorry English is my 3rd language

                              <span>Hi all! My question is about how load balancers work in corporate environments.
 I understand that a load balancer will distribute traffic between backend services, but I&#x27;m not clear on how the load balancer itself doesn&#x27;t become the single point of failure?
 In other words, as the title asks, how do you load balance load balancers?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 ​
 We have been using F5 LB as SMTP relay and CAS machines behind F5.
 ​
 I&#x27;m planning to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 on all the servers including exchange server. I want to logging for a couple weeks to see what I was in for on F5.
 ​
 How can I do that ?
 ​
 Any other pointers appreciated as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying for the CompTIA Network+ certification and I&#x27;m reading Mike Meyers&#x27; Network+ 8th edition exam guide. I&#x27;m currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:
  
inet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 
  
I&#x27;m just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn&#x27;t it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? 
 This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I&#x27;ve even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I&#x27;ve never seen a hex netmask.
 I&#x27;ve tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can&#x27;t find anything definitive about it. 
 I don&#x27;t think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I&#x27;ll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?

                              <span>I have a user who is getting undeliverable email notifications. Looking into it, the email is attempting to be sent from the user, to an x.500 type of address, and then failing.
 Checking the users mailbox, I have found that the subject relates to a meeting from seven years ago, which the user declined. It looks like outlook has started to try and send notifications to the other person invited to the meeting all of a sudden. Several notifications seem to be triggered per day.
 Any clue as to how that may have happened and more importantly where to track down the cause to stop it.
 Thanks for any tips in advance!

 If I get a message reported from users that has a PDF for a Norton renewal (among many other things,) I don&#x27;t even have to look to know that it came from a randomly generated Gmail account. I&#x27;m freaking sick of it and Barracuda is doing a crap job of finding them. Of course, I can&#x27;t just outright block all of Gmail as much as I&#x27;d like to do so.
 This sucks.

 During this time, all these advanced access to portals like azure admin, 0365 administration, switch administration, firewalls, vmware, server administration/patching, citrix server administration, vpn, etc was completely off limits. And just the company culture was that of keeping it that way for people like me.
 So fast forward, company breaks into smaller pieces and I end up as single IT point of contact for all of this. I get the access and surprisingly I find all these things very easy and self explanatory or not something I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find in google and do it. I&#x27;ve already been doing it for 7 months.
 So I&#x27;m now wondering if maybe I have it wrong, b…</span>

                              <span>Long story short, we brought in a contractor to help with some very specific tasks. They are doing fine, but lately they have been extra pushy on getting things that they have partnerships with implemented and most recently, trying to offer assistance with tasks I&#x27;m directly responsible for. We are a small company, and we need the help, but half of me is wondering if they are positioning themselves to get in and replace someone. Am I just paranoid, or do I need to start driving a wedge between them and us? 
 Thoughts ?
 I&#x27;m using &quot;them&quot; for obfuscation.

                              <span>We had a company come to us for some help with an old Windows Server and we noticed they had a LOT of OpenSUSE VMs. I, as someone who uses mostly Windows and Ubuntu, I asked why they choose it, and they stated they liked the stability and optimizations, etc (I don&#x27;t know how accurate that is because as stated before, Windows and Ubuntu). But here&#x27;s the funny part, this is how they got introduced to OpenSUSE (they were a Ubuntu server room before this).
 https://youtu.be/SYRlTISvjww - Uptime Funk 
 A parody song basically introduced the IT staff to OpenSUSE. They did some digging and eventually completely migrated to OpenSUSE back in 2018. This song is basically the IT department&#x27;s theme song. Thought I&#x27;d share this little fun bit from my day working with a really cool group of IT folks.

 I&#x27;m trying to write a PS script which will get a list of all partner tenant names I manage, and tenant id&#x27;s into an array, which will then populate a combo box. I can get a list of tenant id&#x27;s easily using get-msolpartnercontract. But cant get a list of names, which I can add to the array alongside the tenant id&#x27;s
 Anyone have any pointers for me?

                              <span>Engineering startup, we are getting ready to buy a new round of computers and thinking about getting rid of laptops and moving to Mac Minis or iMacs for each engineer plus an iPad Pro. The primary reason is that we’re a hardware startup and we want to give people a way to work on the platform without mailing prototype boards around the country. We do have an office and a lot of people do come in a few days a week as well, so we want most of them to have a dedicated area. We were thinking about using static IP’s and Guacamole RDS to accomplish this. Is this a terrible idea? We’re just trying to figure out a way to standardize our builds but not have to worry about laptops with code and PII on them disappearing or if someone’s got a hardware prototype that gets stolen.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 My company uses GCP and we found the pricing for their VPN pretty confusing. When I was researching a pricing calculator similar to the one u/PFK_Manager made on AWS, I struck out, so I worked with someone at my company to research and create one. If you think AWS VPN pricing is complicated to calculate, Google’s is even worse…
 Here is a calculator for GCP VPN to hopefully save others the trouble we went through. Google’s pricing and documentation was so convoluted that we actually caught some mistakes in their own pricing examples. My summary is below but we also have a full write up here. 
 How Google Cloud VPN Pricing works
 There are three components:
  
A time based cloud VPN gateway charge

 Does anybody know a comprehensive tutorial on how to read those? seems the reason for high CPU usage is due to the constant queries being done by the computers that connect to that RODC but want to know the reason behind those, any insight?

                              <span>Working with a small network that has Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. * All systems have a system certificate deployed that is used for wired or wireless EAP-TLS/802.1x that works (FreeRADIUS deployed on RHEL8 servers) * Some users now have smartcards that they want to incorporate. * Smartcards work fine on Linux and macOS systems for EAP-TLS wired or wireless * Smartcards fail weirdly on Windows 10 (22H2) with this error in the EapMethods-RasTls event logs:
 &quot;Authentication failed for EAP method type 13. The error was 0x80090331.&quot;
 GoogleFu says that error is something like &quot;The client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm.&quot;
 Wireshark packet captures of the EAP conversation show the client sending its list of ciphers it supports in the Client-Hello, and then the Server-Hello coming back using one of those ciphers. But the Windows 10 host stops responding and simply says it could not connect when using the smartcard.
 The same host works fine when using the computer certificate and the cipher exchange looks the same in that case.
 Is there a deeper/better way to get Windows to show me more information so I can figure out what cipher mismatch it thinks it has ? Has anyone seen this error before for EAP-TLS ?

                              <span>I love my Mac book but I run so many VMs of varying operating systems with the Apple moving away from Intel chips I think that&#x27;s out.
 Framework laptop looks like an interesting option but for that price for such a short warranty I&#x27;m concerned that it may not be the laptop that lasts me the next 10 years. But I love the idea of being able to upgrade laptops the way I have my desktop.
 Then there are the HP/Dell powerhouses where the cost of ram/storage is stupid and is not replaceable or upgradeable.
 What would you choose for your next 10 year laptop today?

                              <span>I have a lot of responsibilities besides being a sysadmin. And, like a lot of you I imagine, I’m responsible for the care and feeding of things in a lot of different domains. Some of those domains I have a lot of experience in, some not so much. 
 Because I don’t have the resources or bandwidth to research and test ALL updates for example, I rely on the vendor (or trusted third party) to tell me how critical a vulnerability is to know how soon it needs to be patched. MSFT says there’s a domain controller vulnerability, deploy it to one DC today, the rest tomorrow. I generally don’t try to do an analysis to determine for each vulnerability or update how susceptible we might be. I know I can get burned this way, but I rather risk getting burned by a patch than leaving a known vulnerability in place. I do check reddit to see if a patch Tuesday is particularly rough. Standing on the shoulders of giants if you will.
 I kind of apply this same rule in other domains where I have found best practice dashboards. I know that it won’t find all the problems, but I’m hoping it will at least help us avoid the most common pitfalls.
 Here are some that I use: * AWS - Security Hub, Trusted Advisor * Azure - Advisor * Office 365 - Security checklists (forgot name?) * Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Security Score * Crowdstrike - Spotlight * Custom Dashboards - Grafana, Graylog, misc
 What tools do you use? Does anyone have a great tool for AD/GPO tuneups?

                              <span>Hey r/Sysadmin, hope you&#x27;re all enjoying your weekends? 
 I&#x27;ve recently started publishing M365 related content to help the IT and business communities I serve, and to help me grow as a person / individual. 
 In this video (just under 10 mins) I&#x27;m sharing 10 things you can do to help secure your business using a few best practices, a couple of built-in M365 tools and free stuff. 
 https://youtu.be/8nEjTuFmKgY
 I&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised if anyone is already doing every single point on this list of topics which I cover off:
 - User Education / training
 - Safe Links 
 - Safe Attachments
 - MFA via Conditional Access
 - Location Blocking
 - RBAC / Reduction of privilege
 - DKIM
 - DMARC
 - M365 Portal Branding
 - Backing up M365 data
 Hope you enjoy the content.

                              <span>I have integrated my WD Mycloud EX2 storage with AD for more secure authentication ( I wanted to disable local users ).
 everything worked just fine and all the users appeard in the WD Share permession console, when I set the permession on a shared folder to Public everyone can access it, but when I specify read/write only to the Administrator account it give me access denied and can&#x27;t access the shared folder.
 does this have some issues between unix and windows permissions?
 what can I do?

                              <span>Is there a way (policy / registry / powershell) to make windows 10 apply a default of &quot;Private&quot; instead of &quot;Public&quot; to any new network it encounters? 
 Or, is there a way to make it stop this nonsense and just use &quot;the network&quot; like windows XP did? 
 I know it&#x27;s insecure for a laptop that connects to everything, but I&#x27;m working with desktop PCs on small networks that don&#x27;t have a domain.

                              <span>Good day,
 The company I work for currently uses signature based Symantec AV. Now, we are looking to change to another product.
 The question is, in this ransomware world, is it necessary now to get an EDR tool as well? I wonder how necessary is it? Big companies like Solarwinds, got hacked and they supposedly would have have all the EPP/EDR tools at endpoint. I wondered the effectiveness of these tools.
 Should we just stick to the usual AV or just really look for EDR?
 Please also suggest some of the best tools out there,
 ​
 Thank you!

 I have a list of provisioned edge favorites that deploys to all staff in our organization. 
 I would like to further deploy managed favorites dependent on particular security groups assigned to users. 
 It seems that you can only have one list of provisioned favorites set, so does anyone else have any sort recommendations on how to achieve this?

                              <span>I have about 20-30 deployed PC&#x27;s all across the country running a custom application as their sole job, and I have very few issues with them. The majority of the issues I do get relate to windows updates or nagging. I run them on a local account, not a Microsoft account, and every few months something will happen where it starts asking to switch to a microsoft account or change all of the default browsers or other settings. The users running the application just start clicking through and it brings it out of the validated state and breaks things and I have to log in and change everything back.
 How do I tell windows I want updates, but I don&#x27;t want any default app, account, or other major changes? Seems like there should be a way to do this, but I am not finding anything good so far.

                              <span>So I was on one of the anitwork subs and crucified for making a comment about how sometimes I ask my wife to help with queries I&#x27;m building. I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal but they flipped their shit.
 So my wife is a database developer and she knows SQL like a second langue. She can whip insane queries in minutes that would take me days to build (and still be kind of shitty). Anyway, I don&#x27;t do this often but once in a while I&#x27;m stuck on something and just holler at her like &quot;hey, babe can you check this syntax is OK&quot; or I&#x27;m sitting there and she comes in to see what I&#x27;m doing and we end up going over one. It goes the other way also, there have been quite a few times we are staring at her screen chewing over a problem.
 To me, it&#x27;s not a big deal, it&#x27;s fun sitting together and figuring out a problem (sometimes we end up spending the evening &quot;watching Netflix&quot;), and besides, we both benefit from the money I make from the job.
 But to be clear we never sit in the same room when we are working from home. There&#x27;s a fine line between spending too much time with your spouse. lol

                              <span>Devs were complaining about not able to POST to a web service in AWS from a Dev Server in On-Prem when the request had a large body, for two weeks and started blaming the firewall / VPN. Yeah, as strange as it sounds. 
 Today, my team was involved and managed to identify the maximum body size that could be used in that Dev Server: 1.35KB (I was in awe). More than that, timeout.
 I then involved the network team, no issues. Checked Firewall, no issues. Checked VMware, no issues either. So I decided to test the Webservice from other servers (using Invoke-WebRequest) within the same site: worked. Test the WS in the same VLAN: worked. 
 Narrowed to the same dev server. There was no error log, no other issues.
 So I asked. &quot;Hey, have you tried rebooting the server today or in the last few weeks?&quot; (this is a dev server, so one of them have that privilege). &quot;No&quot;.
 Rebooted the server. 
 WS now worked properly.
 WTF Microsoft?

                              <span>I currently have a DFS Replication group configured to sync files between two servers.
 The share being sync&#x27;d exists on its own drive on each server, so data compared on the drives would be 1:1. 
 Data as it exists on Server A (parent share) 1.6TB used (402 GB free on the drive). A few days into replication now and I have had to expand the drive 3 times now on Server B, as it has completely filled up its first allocation of 2TB far exceeding the 1.6TB of data it should be getting.
 DFSRprivate does exist within the the share, however the staging area was allotted 40GB and conflict/deletion area 20GB. So if factoring in that space, there is no way (that I am aware of) for that area to contribute to the extra 600 GB (and counting) of data making it&#x27;s way onto Server B during this replication. Windirstat also confirms only ~40GB of date in there.
 Curious if anyone out there has seen this behavior before, is this common, something I messed up? Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all, hope you can help me out.
 I&#x27;m a full-time student at Oregon Tech with a full-time job. I am set to graduate soon and need to do a Capstone project. OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we&#x27;re a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.
 My problem is... I don&#x27;t really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.
 My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn&#x27;t really like this idea and insists that it won&#x27;t be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. 
 Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill? Something networking/security or business-adjacent would be highly preferable. Thanks for the help, and feel free to ask me whatever.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We run several Dell VRTX appliances with dual nose Hyper clusters. They run great, but we are looking for a replacement. I have been out of the hardware game for awhile and wanted to see if there were any good recommendations from the community for a small multinode HCI appliance that has network, storage and compute options, like the Dell VRTX. 
 Everything I am finding appears to be 1u appliances that are either compute or storage and meant to be scale out for VMware or nutanix. 
 I am sure there are small units out there, if anyone has any suggestions I would be most grateful 😃

 - Security
 - Easy to maintain, no full time sysadmin
 - Easy to use, really want to use Azure AD SSO for corporate SSID, guest network can be simple password or portal. 
 Interested in Ubiquity for price and features, but it seems Azure AD SSO is simply not possible for WiFi auth.

                              <span>Ok so I’ve got Server01 which is part of a replication group. I want to upgrade it to a version of Windows Server which won’t be EoS next year, I want to have minimal downtime and I don’t want to do an in-place upgrade. Also, there’s a lot of data. 
 So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. 
 So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?
 I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’. I feel like that’s a bad idea but I need to hear someone say it!
 Or is there a better method that I haven’t considered yet? Any suggestions and/or help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hello and happy Saturday :)
 Over the span of a few weeks now I&#x27;ve been working towards improving our network efficiency and speed as it relates to a few Databases we have over two sites.
 The sites are connected over site to site vpn, thus the traversed traffic has a secuirty packet overhead, reducing the mtu available to 1438
 That number was found by doing ping -f [some-ip] -l 1400 then modifying the number to ensure there was no packet fragmentation, that number plus the 28 bit header gave me 1438, however not the point I just wanted to provide context.
 From there I investigated manipulating the MTU via GPO, I came up empty handed however knew there were other options... Option 26 to be presice.
 I added option 26 to our dhcp server, did a reboot on an end device, a forced release/renew, and the mtu ( checked with netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface showed the same default 1500
 from there I grabbed wireshark, grabbed a capture of the renewal, and the ack does show option 26 with the correct value.
 I&#x27;ve checked the logs within the client however there are no entries or evidence that windows knows what to do with this information.
 so, can you help me with a few questions: 1. why does windows not honour dhcp options, speicifcally option 26? and 2. how would you go about modifying the MTU for client devices?
 ty for taking the time and have a great weekend everyone :)

                              <span>A question for you all. When building out a rack of servers etc, you can obviously buy various horizontal and vertical cable management solutions, but what do you use to manage/tidy/protect cables running front to back? Cable trays? Plastic conduit? Other?
 I&#x27;ve never really found a good answer to this, other than having something installed into the rack when it was first put together

                              <span>I would be very greatful if more knowledgeable members of this community would help me find some puzzling answers regarding proper disk benchmarking.
 Here is what I have gathered so far:
 High queue with small block size based on median of files stored on the server usually 16KB-128KB
 Random not sequential read/write depending on read write stats in my case usually 95/5 read/write for web files and 80/20 for database. 
 Fsync on, system memory (ram) cache disabled directly in apps used in my case database ( buffer in mysql disabled ), web server ( file logs disabled ), language parser (in case of php opcache file timestamps disabled, error log to file disabled ), any logging and monitoring apps disabled
 Block sector of disk during formatting anf filesystem is equal between tested drives.
 Fill system memory loaded to the 99% to make sure os especially linux doesn&#x27;t use ram as cache for file operations. Swap file disabled.
 Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.
 Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. 
 Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable
  
Is there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?
 
I&#x27;m wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?
 
I know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?

                              <span>I was assisting an end-user yesterday as he called for some random issue on his computer. Had him on the phone for about 10 minutes and said he didn’t need to be on the phone while I fix this so I would call him back. We hang up and I see him working on his computer (obviously I can’t work while he’s working). I message him twice - once on the app and again on Teams to say only one can work on the computer at a time - no response. An hour and a half passes before he says “sorry, let’s reschedule for tomorrow at 2”. I say fine and call him and 2PM the next day on Teams - rings once and stops. I figure he’s on a call and rejected my call or my call just didn’t go through so I message him - no answer. I was contemplating going upstairs to my main PC where my kid was (I was in the garage) but decided to stay to see if I could reach him. I call him again 10 minutes later and he says “meeting went over - 10 minutes?” This is when I hear my wife yelling my name because my baby fell from the bed about 2 and a half feet asking me if we should go to the hospital. The part that’s pissing me off is this end-user who #1 didn’t have the common sense or listen to me when I said I’m going to work on his PC and to leave his shit alone, #2 I’m trying to baby sit this end-user because he wasn’t courteous enough to give me a heads up that he was late earlier. I feel as if I could’ve helped my son if it wasn’t for this douchebag.

 I am sure it is possible however I have not fully looked into the it yet, however with a few brief searches I couldn’t find anyone who has set up a NPS and CA server joined to an AADDS domain via the site to site VPN tunnel?
 We are fully cloud and a requirement has come up to implement unique logins for our WiFi &amp; VPN. We are using Microsoft AAD as our identity provider. Plan is to also implement 2FA for our VPN by leveraging the AAD MFA extension for the NPS server.

                              <span>Hi,
 Im looking for a cheap solution on how to license users that dont have computers/phones from work. 
 They need access to 3 different system (salary/schema, intranet and a third webbased application) from their own phone (or home computer), i think i want to use the same IDP for federated access so they get SSO. 
 I was thinking of using Azure AD + Microsoft F1, but i dont really have the budget for that.

                              <span>As anyone ever seen Windows Server OS upgrade itself? I was under impression that this had to be done manually. I know how to check regedit to see when OS was updated but does anyone how I can to see how the server was upgraded or is that even possible?
 I have RDS server that was upgraded from WS16 to WS19 and we don’t have licenses for RDS 19.

 I am looking for a cheap RFID antenna and fobs for our keys. Our drivers constantly take our vehicle keys home with them.
 My idea is to have an RFID antenna over the door so that a chime plays and to tell them that they are leaving the building with company keys.
 Does anyone use something like this currently. I looked at the anti theft antennas that stores use but that seems to be an overkill for what I need.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am working to start a small rural ISP and am trying to better understanding of carrier scale routing. My background is in the physical infrastructure side, and I would like to have a good quality rough draft before we start .
 ​
 https://imgur.com/a/yRteSjS is the diagram I&#x27;m working with. The use case is, we have 10 small communities where we&#x27;d like to provide FTTH.
  
We will have two edge facilities. Each edge has 3 routers.
 Each community distribution site will have a link back to each edge facility. The pair of routers at a community will be in VRRP (or HSRP if the router has it).
 The goal is to be a native IPv6 environment. We will have one ASN.
  
Can eBGP, iBGP, and/or OSPF be used to implement a multi-home multi-path load shared environment as diagrammed?
 Given we will be IPv6 native, what would the best practice be for handling IPv4 bound traffic in this environment?
 ​
 Thank you,

                              <span>Help with network setup for small business
 Hello,
 I am a software engineer but I don’t know a lot about networking hardware. I would like to have an idea of what needs to be done to setup a network on a 3 floor building for a small business.
 There will be 26 computers connected through Ethernet (wiring is already in place), and approximately 50 concurrent wifi users, so I guess I’m going to need to place an access point on every floor for wifi.
 There is a small IT room, where I’ll place the router, switches, camera DVRs, etc… though currently I haven’t bought any of the hardware, just the Ethernet wiring from the IT room to the computers.
 Another thing I want to plan for is a possible internet failure, since internet connections in the area are very unreliable, I want a backup fiber connection in case the main one has problems.
 So basically I would really appreciate some guiding regarding a good setup for this. Budget is approximately $3000.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey! I just put a pair of S5224 switches in a VLT stack in production. The config isn’t anything out of the ordinary, some L3 vlan interfaces and some L2 interfaces. 
 Before I went live with them I had no issues with slow logins on SSH (like 2sec to get in after entering pw) and our observium was polling snmp without any issues. 
 Now however the sign-in takes 80-100sec and they stop to respond to snmp polls once every hour. The network however works 100% fine. If you ping any interface on it I don’t lose a single ping. Cpu hovers around 10% and memory around 40%. 
 Anyone experienced this issue before? I’m running the latest os10 10.5.4.3.

                              <span>I have an architecture question and was hoping one or some of you networking geniuses could help me out. 
 I am implementing an architecture where agnostic front ends will send backend requests to load balanced reverse proxies. The complication I am facing is that each backend is individual to an organization, so each backend will be spun up in its own environment (containers), but the routing BETWEEN the front end and the organization’s specific backend container is where I am having trouble. 
 The simple solution that comes to mind is to use a header and implement some sort of header-based lookup to obtain either IPs or DNS names to route to the correct upstream. I feel like there’s a million and one ways to do this but I feel like I’m missing the “right” (simple/robust/scalable) way to do it. 
 The goal will be to deploy agnostic front ends as needed based on load, and then auto deploy a backend/middleware-with-lookup-table/updated-proxy-config for each organization that joins. 
 Have any of you solved this type of routing issue? Am I missing something to simplify this process? Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Hi, we are in the middle of migrating our current ASA with FPSM&#x27;s to Palo Altos. Physical side of things is all done and prepped but we are trying to figure out the best way/approach to migrating what rules we want from our ASA&#x27;s to Palos. I&#x27;ve looked into migration tools but haven&#x27;t really found anything yet that I can start from.
 I&#x27;m guessing people here have done this many a time now, what has been your best way of doing it?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone, everything good ?
 First I would like to apologize for my English, I&#x27;m from Brazil and I&#x27;m using the translator.
 We currently use in the company Aruba Instant On for Switch, Unifi for Wireless. We are going to move to another building and with that came the opportunity to improve our infrastructure. Our company is considered average here in Brazil, we work with road infrastructure works and at the office we currently have 80 users with a tendency to grow. There are about 200 devices. Now are my doubts.
 In the above scenario, does Aruba&#x27;s Instant On line still serve us or should we think about Aruba Enterprise? For wireless we intend to migrate to another company considering that Ubiquiti does not have support, which one should we consider for our case?

                              <span>For context I am following this tutorial: https://youtu.be/0EklBDIZSgc (timestamp 3:30)
 It is VMWare running Windows Server 2019 with a Bridged Adapter.
 In the video he configures a static IP address of 192.168.50.201 based on his default gateway 192.168.50.1.
 This is an example of a setup I have tried: https://i.imgur.com/8WPDA1G.png
 Since my default gateway is 192.168.0.1 I assigned a static IP address of 192.168.0.201 (I have also tried various other numbers on the last octet in case it was some weird conflict issue, as well as typing exactly what he did in case I was missing something) but upon validating my network settings I get this:
 https://i.imgur.com/0r1IzaL.png
 And this is the ipconfig:

 And when I try something like ipconfig /renew or /release I get the following error: 
 &quot;This operation failed as no adapter is in the state permissible for this operation.&quot;

 One of the more affordable HDD options are the 1.92TB 400-AXSD , which are marked as &quot;Read Intensive SSD&quot; when you get into the quote.
 We&#x27;re considering putting 4x of these in raid10
 What is the overall performance of these drives like, are they equivalent to consumer sata SSDS when it comes to write speeds or are they substantially slower when writing data?

                              <span>Is this a rant? Could this be a rant? Yes it is, albeit in monotone.
 Just noticing the recent spate of recruiters. The complaint has been, steady as rain on the rooftops during monsoon season, that recruiters don&#x27;t read. Fair enough. I did set out to make my resume easily readable and answer 90% of common questions. But the past 6 weeks has been tip-tappier than normal. It seems that these recruiters must hear you say it, on the phone, before it will register across the screen inside their minds. Only about 10% is recognized on the summary page when they skim despite being spelled-out in short bursts.
 I try my best to help them by telling them upfront that most of the base information they need is on the first page. Furthermore, I try to get the basics out of them before committing to a …</span>

                              <span>Most of you will have figured this out or already knew it.
 There are some who are just running into this because they haven&#x27;t enabled modern authentication on a tenant. If you have found yourself in that situation; I hope this may be of help to you.
 I may have missed it in documentation, but the following were not obvious to me as a newbie to oauth2, and didn&#x27;t come up in the searches of the forums:
 You do need to have ssl enabled bindings
 While the redirect URL does not have to be publicly resolvable, using loopback fails on machines other than the server itself for obvious reasons. To use a non-loopback URL, ssl must be enabled. Self signed works.
 There are two separate Microsoft guides on osTicket&#x27;s site, one for SSO (portal) and the other to enable an email fetch. It is easy to confuse the two via search terms.
 Good luck.

                              <span>I am trying to copy from a eSATA enclosure holding a 4TB HDD with some (okay, more than some, ALOT) bad sectors. I&#x27;ve tried running a check disk but it never completes, I&#x27;ve resorted to trying to robocopy everything off of it using the command;
 robocopy 4TBDRIVE:\ \\NETWORKLOCATION\SAN /MT:1 /r:0 /w:0 
 I&#x27;ve been able to get some files off, but robocopy keeps getting stuck on certain files, obviously ones with bad sectors. I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to get it to skip these and move onto the next if the percent copied doesn&#x27;t move in say 1 minute ... it just sits there forever, until I stop the copy, go into the disk, delete the file and start all over. There is about 2000 files I need to copy off so I am hoping that there is a better way.

 Has anyone seen issues since the October updates?
  
&quot;Because of these additional protections, domain join operations are intentionally prevented from re-using an existing computer account in the target domain.Domain join operations will be blocked automatically after installing the October 2022 security updates on client computers due to additional security checks before re-using an existing computer account (the changes do not affect new accounts).
  
I assume since most people&#x27;s &quot;golden&quot; images are a little older (e.g. most recent updates aren&#x27;t slipstreamed), and most domain-join operations occur during imaging before the OS is patched, this might be going under the radar.
 More from the article:
  
This happens unless the user attempting to join the domain does not have the appropriate write permissions (i.e., the user is the creator of the existing account or the computer was created by a domain administrator).Microsoft explained that domain join processes might intentionally fail with &quot;0xaac (2732): NERR_AccountReuseBlockedByPolicy&quot; errors saying that &quot;An account with the same name exists in Active Directory. Re-using the account was blocked by security policy.&quot;&quot;Affected scenarios include some domain join or re-imaging operations where a computer account was created or pre-staged by a different identity than the identity used to join or re-join the computer to the domain.&quot;
  
Hopefully this isn&#x27;t as dastardly as it sounds...?

                              <span>I recently began a new job at a company of 350+ employees with what seems to me to be an exceptionally large infrastructure for what the company is and its size. Perhaps I&#x27;m just very green, but we have about 300 production servers with all the apps and services that run on them coming to about 500+.
 I&#x27;m a new Sysadmin straight out of college with some internship experience and a little bit of freelance as well as personal home-lab setup. However, I&#x27;m a little overwhelmed by the size of what I&#x27;m getting into with this job. I&#x27;m very excited, but I am unsure on how to best go about just getting an understanding and layout of the IT infrastructure. My team is about 3 including myself and while they are happy to answer questions, it&#x27;s unreasonable to ask them to sit-down and talk me through each server and what it does. 
 Do others have any tips, tricks or suggestions on how to just familiarize myself with the infrastructure?
 I&#x27;ve been given the job of building out a Zabbix server for monitoring purposes and that seems to be a really good way to start as it will force me to become familiar with everything. However,it is also hard to figure out what to monitor and how best to setup useful alerts if I don&#x27;t know the infrastructure.

                              <span>I was recently reminded that not everyone learns FC troubleshooting in their sysadmin careers. I thought I&#x27;d post this here for future reference in case someone needs.
 The guy that taught me everything fibre channel gave me a list and order of troubleshooting steps. I have tried to reconstruct them here. As this was 10 years ago, it may not be 100% what he said, but I think it&#x27;s pretty close.
 troubleshooting FC:
  
host (initiator) HBA driver
 host HBA status
 switch port for initiator
 cabling to initiator
 zoning connecting the initiator to target
 cabling to target
 port on target
 LUN to port mapping
 port security
  
Start with 1 and go to 9, for all things able to be checked remotely first, then check physical. 3-7 can be checked partially with one step, checking the switch to make sure they show links. This excludes 90% of issues. Leave checking the physical cabling and SFPs until all others are excluded. So, troubleshooting order should be 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 3/4, 6/7
 May it be useful to someone, someday.

I&#x27;ve been a systems admin for 7 years and I&#x27;m really looking to move away ASAP, but it&#x27;s been impossible so far. Are there just a ton of experienced sysadmins in major cities with not enough jobs for everyone? In the past when I&#x27;ve applied locally, I&#x27;ve been offered an interview almost every time I&#x27;ve applied somewhere. Is 7 years just not enough experience anymore?

                              <span>Evening all,
 We go through quite a lot of headsets and bought a load of Manhattan USB headsets from our regular supplier.
 We also use sophos endpoint and use it’s usb device protection features, most devices are blocked unless we allow them.
 Storage devices are certainly heavily restricted, so strangely, we found new, out of the packet headsets, that are being blocked because they have storage in them.
 Tested on a machine that is isolated from the network and doesn’t have sophos on it, and found that it does indeed show a storage device, but doesn’t show up any drive.
 My first thought is that it’s a small batch of devices that may have been tampered with and is collecting audio. Which if it’s the case, is very bad.
 But if it’s not, what is it for, considering other “identical” model devices from the same order don’t have it at all.
 What can I do to try and figure it out, or should I just bring it up with the supplier/Manhattan?
 Thanks

                              <span>We are using M365 for email hosting with our MX records pointing to Mimecast as our primary email security solution. In recent months we have noticed more phishing emails being allowed through Mimecast and delivered to our users. We have very little in the way of EOP policies in place, our original thinking being that Mimecast is our email security layer in the first instance, not EOP. We&#x27;re now thinking about enabling the policies in EOP to act as a second line of defence. We&#x27;ve even noticed genuine phishing emails that have come through Mimecast to then be flagged as phishing by EOP, but delivered to user mailboxes due to our EOP Anti-spam -&gt; Connection filter policy that has all the Mimecast IPs within it, which then bypasses the majority of checks. Not good!
 Is anyone here running in this manner with Mimecast and EOP or indeed another security product sat in front of EOP? I&#x27;d be interested to hear how your EOP policies are configured, with regards to:
  
Anti-phishing
 Anti-spam
 Enhanced filtering
 Safe Links (Minecast vs EOP - We&#x27;re using Mimecast, which as I understand is a retrospective check of URLs when a user clicks)
  
Are your users OK with having multiple places to check for quarantined/junk emails? e.g. 1st line product (Mimecast in our case), Microsoft and Junk folder in Outlook.
 Are we attacking this in the wrong way and should be focusing on tightening up Mimecast rather than looking at EOP?
 Thanks in advance!

 Anyone else getting fed up with being asked to handle shit outside your scope while also being bugged and blamed for things not going as fast as everyone wants.
 Post COVID I have noticed a ridiculous increase in wait times for everything. Examples
  
Moved our shop to a wireless long range AP solution to share internet with main office (building is close) to cut down on our overall internet costs. AP equipment from CISCO took literally 6 months to get. Pushed back demolition of building near the shop as our Fuel Management Pump System is there and would be cut off from internet before AP installed if we demo&#x27;d 
 AC in shop storage room went out. Was asked for some reason to handle it so contacted and scheduled the recommended person boss wanted to use and it&#x27;s taken them a week to finally come out but shop manager sends me repeated emails on when this is going to get done.
 Anytime I order equipment needed outside the basics it takes a week or even two to arrive. Bosses complain every time saying it should be 2 days tops like everything is Amazon.
 All Vendors I deal with lately whether its security system maintenance or door fixes/AC are behind in work and take days to show up sometimes. Again... bosses whine about it and get aggravated. 
  
Question is, anyone else notice this trend getting worse? Especially an escalation in impatience lately?

 We&#x27;re looking to create a GPO, or whatever is applicable, to automatically switch client machines to our public WiFi in the event the private network is down. Is there a way to store the public WiFi credentials and ensure that the machine only uses this as a failover -- i.e. it will always prioritize the private network when available? Thanks for any insight.

                              <span>Hi,
 just a quick question as I&#x27;m really unsure and maybe somebody could help me out on this one :D
 How would I have to license RDS when using multiple RDS servers where those servers are NOT redundant but rather server A serves use-case A and reaches VLAN A whereas server B is used for a totally different use-case (and another pool of users)?
 Can they both share a single RDS user CAL-pool? Would I have to have multiple RDS CAL pools (and license servers)?
 Or am I totally wrong on everything? :D
 Thanks. Much appreciated :)

                              <span>Hi!
 I am searching for some USB thumb drives, that can survive on a bunch of keys and that can survive daily use for multiple years.
 ​
 Are you using anything, that can fit my criteria?
 ​
 Thank you for your hints!

                              <span>TL/DR: would you hire someone with this on their resume:
 “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I had a candidate interviewing not long so ago and after reading their resume noticed they listed dump sites as one of their study materials. 
 This person had a ton of certs and had that they were current slated to take another one and had next to it listed that they are studying with pass4sure. 
 Basically “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I was super interested in interviewing this person mainly to ask wtf but unfortunately HR killed it after everyone brought it up. 
 A few colleagues basically said well if they still know their stuff what does it matter and basically work smarter not harder but obviously in a half joking sort of way. My opinion has always been cheating degrades everyone and worse yet forced those making exams to write worse and worse questions. 
 So would you hire someone that listed this?

 Is this due to the recent microsoft breach?

                              <span>Looking for some info on Canon printer/copier/scanner drivers, specifically with respect to deciding whether to use PCL6 or UFR II drivers in a Windows environment. We&#x27;ve always used PCL6 (for decades) but noticed a printing issue within Acrobat when using PCL6 that isn&#x27;t present with UFR II. IIRC, our Canon reseller mentioned something about UFR II not being compatible at the time we rolled out our six Canon devices, but I do not have any notes as to WHY that was the case. Any insight or experiences with either of these drivers would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Has anyone worked with a third party to help develop a formalized Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity Plan? My thought would be to contract a third party that has experience writing formal technical documents and I would work with them to develop a plan. Essentially, there would be several meetings where they interviewed me about infrastructures and systems and they would develop the document. Has anyone gone through this process before with a vendor? If so what were the costs? $2,500 , $5,000, $30,000 and who would you recommend.

                              <span>An employee was let go, and we cannot get into his MacBook Pro 2016.
 He apparently had Admin access, because our documented local admin account isn&#x27;t being accepted.
 It is not bound to the domain, although that is how it was configured when we gave it to him, so we can&#x27;t login with AD credentials.
 I cannot tell if he used an AppleID to sign in.
 Is there any way to reset this thing so we can re-use it?
 As in the title, we don&#x27;t know his password, and there is no reset code to use.
 There are no other Mac&#x27;s available to download MacOS from the store and create install media.
 Is this an expensive boat anchor?

                              <span>Hello all,
 First off if I need to throw this in one of the other various IT subreddits I will; I figured I’d start here and go elsewhere if need be. 
 I am currently a “Network Administrator”. I was hired into this role shortly after joining my current company after the previous guy left mere months after I joined. The title makes little sense though; we rarely make any networking related changes or overhauls. Most of our environment is plug and play, and I’m not really allowed to make proper changes. (IE our largest location is one giant flat /8 and they don’t want that changing anytime soon). I am angling for a Title change to “Systems Administrator” to better fit the role I’m performing. 
 With that being said, I’m also looking for a compensation increase. While I am compensated fairly…</span>

 The site does have a street address listed in its &quot;contact us&quot; section in California. We&#x27;re on the east coast. The site is hosted with Name.com and uses Cloudflare for DNS (just A records).
 I&#x27;ve used the wayback machine to capture a few pages just in case.
 What on earth do we do? They&#x27;re clearly using our trademarks and copyrighted images. I have no idea if they&#x27;re just stealing credit cards from &quot;customers&quot;, actually reselling our products, or what.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 the company I work for sells document management software and recently some of our clients started asking if we have a &quot;customer portal&quot; so they can provide their documents to their end customers. 
 Our DMS solution does not provide this functionality yet, so I am looking to either buy/integrage &amp; adapt a third party solution or build our own. (classic make or buy decision)
 ​
 Now I am currently in the phase to check/analyse what is available out in the wild that we could probably integrate so we don&#x27;t have to re-invent the wheel. 
 This is why I am asking for your suggestions/recommendations of software/platforms that I might wanna have a look at. 
 ​
 Our clients who use our document management system want to be able to provide a selection of documents via a &quot;portal&quot; to their customers. Their customers might be other businesses or private people. For example a bank that wants to provide the bank statements to their customers via such portal. Or a construction company that wants to provide technical drawings to their contractors. etc. 
 ​
 The basic use case is more or less the same, though the industry varies. 
 ​
 The platform would sit in between the consumer of the documents and our document management system. 
 Most likely the communication between the platform and the DMS should be via REST API&#x27;s.
 ​
 Do you know of any solution that might cover the basic or advanced requirements of such a &quot;portal&quot; ?
 ​
 I&#x27;m also considering building something with the M365 platform (PowerApps, Azure Functions, PowerAutomate, etc.)
 ​
 One of the solutions I&#x27;ll be looking at will be https://www.deepbox.swiss/en/overview/
 ​
 Any ideas/suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>Hi All,
 Doing routine checks of our sign in logs.
 We have this week a user who&#x27;s account is registering a sign in, non mfa (single authentication - previously satisfied) every 3 to 5 minutes.
 The service is;
 Microsoft Teams Web Client - Skype Presence Service 
 ​
 Doing an audit does not show Teams signing in.. Can anyone shed any light as to what this is? We don&#x27;t use Skype, use Teams of course.. is this just the agent having issues or?
 Only one user.

                              <span>I recently read this thing called &quot;Cyber Signals&quot; - a new publication from Microsoft. These numbers made my skin itch, they seem so cheap! 
 🧑‍💻 Attacker for hire: Prices start at $250 per job 🧑‍💻
 🪲 Ransomware SaaS kit: $40 per month 🪲
 💻 Compromised PC: $0.13-$0.89 💻
 🔑 Stolen Credentials: $150 for 400 million (!!!!) 🔑
 🕵️ Spearphishing for hire: $100-$1000 per successful account 🕵️ 
 So for less than the cost of your weekly shopping, you can buy a Ransomware SaaS kit (now so popular it has it&#x27;s own name: RaaS). 
 For the price of your council tax, you can buy 400 million stolen credentials. 
 For the price of your energy bill this month, you can hire an attacker. 
 For somewhere around the price of your mortgage or rental payment, you could pay for a successful takeover of a highly targeted, important account within an organisation. 
 I was absolutely floored to learn how low some of these numbers are; especially the Spearphishing one. Okay, you have to know what to do with it afterward.. But even so, it&#x27;s a crazy world we live in. 
 Remember; You have to defend perfectly every time, an attacker only has to get it right against you once. Protect yourself: do the basics, do them well: 
 🔒 Enable MFA
 💉 Ensure virus definitions are up to date
 ⬆️ Keep endpoints (PC, laptop AND mobile) fully patched
 🚫 Don&#x27;t give out unnecessary admin privileges
 💾 Back up your data 
 Actioning the above will give you protection from 98% of attacks, say Microsoft.

                              <span>Hi all
 I have two servers running keepalived to share a virtual IP
 and haproxy to forward mail traffic to two mail servers using roundrobin. 
 Where i am currently stuck is
 when my IP fails over using keepalive(which works as expected)
 My HAProxy service doesn&#x27;t restart, so even though the IP fails over the server doesn&#x27;t work because haproxy is offline so no mail gets passed through.
 How do i ensure the haproxy service gets restarted once teh server picks up the VIP
 Here is my keepalived config
 ​
 global_defs { router_id haproxy02 # The hostname of this host! } vrrp_script haproxy { script &quot;killall -0 haproxy&quot; interval 2 weight 2 } vrrp_instance 50 { virtual_router_id 50 advert_int 1 priority 100 state Master interface eth0 virtual_ipaddress { 192.168.30.145 dev eth0 # The virtual IP address that will be shared betwee MASTER and BACKUP. } track_script { haproxy } } 
 My Backup haproxy has the same config but state is backup and priority is 50 
 thanks for taking a look

The majority of their network shares are on one site’s server and accessed from the other site. The reliability is awful. I’d love to hear some recommendations for the best cloud solution for multi-location file sharing. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Part of a multi domain forest, the CA and Offline CA are in the same domain as these DCs. CA is set to only issue certs to the domain.
 Offline CA has been offline throughout this as well it shouldn&#x27;t be needed. CRLs are all valid. PKIView comes back all ok.
 I can see the standard AD templates on the DCs
 I can see the custom templates on other devices if I add them, just not the DCs
 I&#x27;ve tried adding a single DC on to the permisions for the template restarting the CA and still nothing
 The templates have the following persmions
 Authenticated users - Read
 Domain Admin - Read Enroll
 Domain Controlers - Enroll, Auto Enroll
 Tried settings Enterprise Domain Conrollers to Enroll too but made no difference.
 Has there been some changes to AD that means there&#x27;s now an extra step for DCs to see templates?

 Recommendations for a small, portable/luggable B&amp;W laserjet printer/scanner that will happily connect via USB on Windows 10, doesn&#x27;t require an internet connection, doesn&#x27;t require a login, and if the drivers are already installed, doesn&#x27;t need elevated permissions to do anything.

                              <span>Hi all,
 At the request of the boss, I&#x27;ve been implementing PIM this week in time for an MSP switcheroo next week. 
 I&#x27;m writing an email to explain how to request roles in response to &#x27;we tried logging in and don&#x27;t have access&#x27; from the new service desk but I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble with the test account I&#x27;ve put together to grab screenshots from - 
 ​
 1- Should I need to sign out/in for the role to become active? The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don&#x27;t need to sign out/in. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a &#x27;no access sucker&#x27; unless I signed out/in.
 Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays
 ​
 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don&#x27;t have access to the ECP. 
 Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it&#x27;s immediately there and works flawlessly. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve signed out and in to these accounts so many times I&#x27;m ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I&#x27;m just having a particularly bad friday night. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it&#x27;s just been me all along

                              <span>Hello everyone
 I&#x27;m the systems admin (and CIO) for a small EU company with a centralized IT system hosting data on a windows file server (in a datacenter accessible via VPN). We also have a Google Workspace plan with an account for each employee.
 Each employee has a windows laptop with a VPN client, once the VPN is on the mapped drives on windows explorer are available. Share permissions are managed in AD.
 Everything on the file server is backed up with a 30-day retention scheme on AWS.
 My CEO wishes to switch all data hosting from the file server to shared Google Drives. He feels the data will be more easily accessible this way, but I really have concerns about this - about security mostly, but also data sync on the PCs and disk space, backups, ... I am reluctant about entrusting sensible data to a 3rd party.
 Is there a consensus about doing something like this in the sysadmin world ? I need to establish a lit of pros / cons to help making the decision : either keep everything as is or follow through.
 If I were to go through with this, are there some good practices to follow ? (obviously enabling MFA will be mandatory)
 Thanks

                              <span>Nestled in a basement office where the carpet likely has not been changed since Elvis breathed his last and the wallpaper since the Cuban missile crisis I work my electronic tasks.
 With no other IT staff on the continent currently I have to manage offices for a international organization to the best of my ability in my remote office.
 Not helped by often confusing and baffling requests from the head office, so elusive the number of times I have been there could be counted on one hand and I would still have a few fingers to lose.
 ​
 One request that came through a while back still eludes me to the reason why and no answers are forthcoming despite my requests.
 Just before a long weekend I am to lockdown the emails of 5 staff members of head office. No reason given. Just told to do so and if they send in tickets or call me, to let them know we are working on it.
 Its not until after the long weekend and several requests by the locked users for help that I am told to unlock them.
 ​
 No reason is given why, only that the masters of the company half a world away want it.
 None of them were fired as far as i know which makes sense (perhaps someone screwed up or was being terminated and we needed to limit access, that is nothing new to me).
 But nothing as far as I know changed and as all the other IT staff are out of contact right now, I would be the one to remove their access.
 ​
 It just leaves me with a uncertainty in my stomach.
 ​
 I am curious if any others have this happen to you. Told to change permissions like this with seemingly no rhyme or reason ?

                              <span>I occasionally work at a site that has an interesting setup. It is a medium size Campus LAN type network, with 15 or so buildings each with a switch and each switch is connected to the next in a giant ring, with one link disabled by STP.
 I know the obvious answer is a ring topology, but this is a little unusual right? This is in an industrial type environment on an air-gapped system.
 Are there any benefits to running a network like this?

                              <span>Recently joined a company who signed with Masergy for their SDWAN OTT offering. 
 I am the sole network engineer and am making changes left and right to get things up to speed from the prior self-proclaimed engineer.
 We have not been impressed with their support or their implementation of SDWAN. It is legitimately just FortiGates following Fortinets MSP cookbook examples with a few changes. An insane amount of money for something I can do on my own faster, better and more reliably. 
 They use FortiManager and RestAPI Admins to pull analytics into their dashboard. We could get our own appliance for FMG and FAZ to accomplish this. 
 Why does this feel like a product designed for organizations without a dedicated network engineer? Am I missing the value here? Please, help me understand.

                              <span>Admittedly - BGP is my weakest point in networking. I know the full stack (wireless/switch/route/firewall); just not a ton of BGP experience. 
 I just tried attaching a visio, but /r networking wont allow images?
 I&#x27;m planning out architecture for SD wan mesh behind 2 BGP routers and after going through the documentation and videos; I really can&#x27;t figure out a way to define two different paths out of the network coming from a singular /24. Typically you&#x27;d create your sdwan interfaces and prefer one etc, but i only have one interface.
 Can&#x27;t do anything tricky with private IP space due to port-forwarding/ipsec and overall firewalling. Im thinking im going to need to re-configure the OUTSIDE interfaces with BGP and get rid of the route redistribution down to EIGRP. But even if I do; i still only have one interfaces
 Architecture
 2 Edge routers bgp peered between each other, distro&#x27;d EIGRP down to the firewalls (going to migrate to ospf cuz fortigate). 
 Hoping to get SD Wan set up to pipe critical org traffic out primary ISP and youtube/fb out the secondary ISP.

 getting a bit confused, there are multiple labs (3) totaling $400, does this include the exam or do I have to pay for the exam/cert separately people are saying the total cost of the exam is $400 so I&#x27;m getting a bit confused.

                              <span>I&#x27;d love to hear comments from people using EEE in real life. I recently tested a 48 port switch with all ports connected but with no traffic and saw a decrease in actual power consumption in the switch of ~15%. It was measured with an external current clamp meter, so pretty exact readings and not what the switch measured. 15% is not massive and when traffic actually starts to flow, that will decrease of course. What kind of accumulated savings do you see in your network?
 Have you seen problems with it? Why is it not the default settings if it has no adverse effects?

 I have made this question roughly a couple of years ago and people have commented that it is still worth pursuing it.
 I want to ask it again today: Do you think that someone should spend their time learning CCIE? I think learning cloud/automation/DevOps is far more relevant nowadays than the CCIE.
 This is excluding Cisco shops of course, where they need certified engineers to hold their status.

 We only need 24 ports (needs to be POE for access points) and will connect back to our core switches via 10GB fiber. 48 would still be fine if cost weren&#x27;t 2X a 24 port model. It would be going into an IDF cabinet that is in our warehouse, which is full of dust, so it needs to be something that can tolerate the environment.
 I know Arista has been up &amp; coming but I don&#x27;t know which model(s) would be a good fit.
 What else would you be considering?

                              <span>What is the best virtual router/switch to use for running vxlan labs in GNS3? I understand a lot of virtual devices tend to be more limited than their physical counter parts. Is there any virtual ones that support all the major vxlan/mp-bgp/evpn functions?

I was wondering if anyone has any resources so i can learn a bit. I tried setting it up, but i only repeated the commands from the guide. I was hoping i can get a grasp of the different Terms used(line-profile, GEM ports?, T-CONTs?) , some best practices?

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>cellular providers often have monthly data limits, but additional data available for specific apps (like instagram, whatsapp, viber,...) 
 i think that it has something to do with the dns server, because if i turn on private dns, the data im using on an app is billed as regular internet usage and not that specific app usage

                              <span>Hi all,
 currently my company has a set of Cisco ASA&#x27;s in a datacenter for Point to site VPN connectivity. Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. 
 But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can&#x27;t be transferred to native Azure VPN&#x27;s. 
 I&#x27;ve seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can&#x27;t find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I&#x27;m not sure if this would fix our &quot;issue&quot;.
 Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I&#x27;d rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I&#x27;m also not tied to Cisco btw.

 I&#x27;d like to deny access to other devices in the same subnet for a particular PC with a managed switch but allow access to two printers and internet, is this possible with a managed switch?

                              <span>We have one domain account, it is getting locked 3-4 times a day. Started to happen 2 days ago.
 It&#x27;s only one domain account (others are fine), user is long time employee and knows what he is doing.
 User says that they are just doing their work, reading email, saving PDFs and suddenly they can&#x27;t access any shared drive (because their account was locked).
 Checked Security Logs, there are no events ID: 4740 (Is it possible that login it was disabled?)
 Downloaded Lockout status but Orig Lock only shows the domain computer that locked this account.
 Is it possible to find out what computer/IP request was originated from with wrong account info?

                              <span>I have a server that started being inaccessible internally only every evening around the same time and access is restored after ~1hr. You cannot access the website OR RDP to it as it has a trust relationship error. It runs a Jira instance on it. The web interface is still accessible externally during this time as well as still being accessible as local host within the browser in the server. There is no backup running during the time its inaccessible and event logs do not show anything abnormal. Anyone have ideas?

                              <span>Hi there,
 We had to pull drives from a dell R620 server. There were 6 drives in total that had to be removed from the server. It is believed that 2 are in a RAID 1 for the OS and the remaining 4 in a RAID 5 but it is not confirmed. I won&#x27;t get into why we couldn&#x27;t confirm that, it&#x27;s a long story, but just go with it. 
 The drives were pulled BUT I realize that we did not note down the exact slot each drive came from. We will need to pop them back in further down the road. My initial thought process was the RIAD controller should be smart enough to figure it out, but I am realizing that might not be the case and I may have made a grave mistake.
 Just wondering if there&#x27;s any insight on whether or not the physical slot matters when it comes time to plug them back in. 
 Thank you very much

 Question is, with all of you being in the field for a lot longer than I, what is your personal favorite printers / brands and why?

                              <span>Anyone else going grey from the RDP issues effecting servers from the recent patches. 
 The reg key fix does not fix the problem for any of my team. 
 I only observe reset packets to a domain controller during the rdp request. Removing the October and September CU’s from that DC, resolve the issue seemingly. 
 My problem is that it appears totally random, I will have clients all at the same patch level, remote to the same server using the same dc. It will fail for one client and have no issue with the other. I will reboot the clients and it will start working again. 
 To add more salt to the wounds the OOB fix MS released does piss all for any win10/11 clients &amp; I’m not sure if they even acknowledged the issue right now

Running nslookup produces correct results. Can RDP between VMs from Azure and to any on prem servers. Started Monday. Has anyone seen this happen before?
 UPDATE: Removing KB5018474 from the on prem DC resolved the issue.

                              <span>Hello,
 Today our company hosted a Town Hall in Teams, and we had some serious issues that our CEO was pissed about.
 Background: Users were mostly on wired internal network, and using the Desktop Teams app.
 Had over 100 people in the call and we were recording it.
 1). Anyone with a webcam on was extremely laggy and glitchy, but audio was fine.
 2). Screen Sharing a video would not show for users in the call, they could only see a grey square.
 Had no issues when I joined on my phone and even the recording was fine. It&#x27;s when we were live that we had issues.
 Any solutions to this, I saw disabling GPU hardware acceleration helped, but I can&#x27;t find a way to disable it for all users.

                              <span>Hello, fellow computer janitors!
 I was informed 3 days ago that in 2 weeks I&#x27;ll be undergoing a &quot;job audit&quot; which seems to be some dude asking me questions about what I do and how it compares to my job description. I figured &quot;eh whatever&quot; at first, but the thought hasn&#x27;t escaped my mind. Have any of you undergone an audit like this before?

 Duplicate old EAP-MS-CHAPv2 Policy
 Name the new one accordingly for EAP-TLS

 Constraints - Disable all &quot;Less secure authentication methods&quot; checkboxes
 Constraints - Change EAP type to Smart Card
 Settings – Remove all but “Strongest encryption”
 Enable policy and bring processing order above existing policy

                              <span>We&#x27;re getting straight up hammered with attacks right now - very targeted phishing, something is brute force hitting accounts, etc. Obviously these things go on all the time, but there&#x27;s been a dramatic uptick in the last 24 hours. The weird thing is, when accounts are compromised, we&#x27;re not able to see the logins in Azure at all, so we don&#x27;t even know where it&#x27;s coming from. Anyone else experiencing similar?
 Edit: Thanks everyone! We&#x27;re working on enabling and enforcing MFA, but we&#x27;ve got a few more weeks for a crunch to end before we&#x27;re allowed to implement.

                              <span>Having just endured 30 excruciating minutes of utter braindead idiocy that is trying to setup and configure WPA2-Enterprise on a Windows 10 machine, I wanna go and frickin&#x27; kill myself.
 ​
 How can it be so bad after so many years this protocol has been out?! Not only can the authentication options be changed only in the who knows how many years old control panel settings and not the modern settings app, but once you finish setting up the network, you can no longer modify some of the key attributes like which CA certificates to validate the radius server against!
 ​
 What. The. Hell. Microsoft.
 ​
 I swear, I don&#x27;t usually get my jimmies rustled at work, but this... This just bloody infuriated me!
 ​
 And that&#x27;s not the end of it, either!
 Once you finally figure out how to configure the authentication details... Unless you remembered to change one tiny little option in the PEAP configuration, if someone was to impersonate an AP, even if they present a completely different and invalid server certificate, windows just displays a puny little dialog going something like &quot;Do you expect this network to be present here?&quot; along with a hyperlink option to display the radius certificate, and a pair of buttons - Connect / Cancel.
 ​
 No huge warning like in web browsers, if a page presents an invalid SSL cert, noooo. No 3-dialogs-deep exception confirmation option or secret keyboard phrases. 
 ​
 A simple. Yes. No. 
 ​
 Am I missing something here, or would that take away all the benefits the Enterprise version of WPA2 has?

 i was curious how you guys keep your skills sharp, learn new stuff or maybe you have a specific platform were you learn certain stuff.
 I have been on ITProTV before and i&#x27;ve seen some interesting stuff there but atm gonna try coursera to find leaning materials to improve my IT Knowledge. 
 What do you use as your learning platform and why?

                              <span>Greetings and salutations! I am researching products that have the capability of monitoring/reporting across endpoint platforms at a minimum Windows and Mac. Anything more than that is bonus. Also, speed of reporting is crucial.
 Have not been searching for long but am interested in your suggestion and thought/ideas.

                              <span>Hi guys, as title suggests we have a couple of Acer laptops here and they all seem to go to sleep once shortly after booting up. After this happens it’s usually fine for the rest of the day.
 See below for error from error log:
 The system is entering sleep.
 Sleep reason application API
 Source: kernel-power
 Event ID 42
 Any advice would be appreciated. Even downloaded software “don’t sleep” and disabled sleep but it still does it.
 Edit
 It used to happen a lot more frequently, we thought it could be the cheap adapters we had. Replacing them helped a lot, but still sleeps occasionally but always seems to be very shortly after booting.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been asked to implement a PAM solution (Privileged Access Management). In a Microsoft Windows ecosystem (with mostly on-prem Active Directory but a little Azure AD mixed in), what does this look like? Does Microsoft have some basic PAM options built into their OS/Directory services? is there a separate Microsoft solution you can use (or purchase) that creates a basic PAM solution? if not, what third-party options exist? we use the following vendors for additional infrastructure services so something from them would be nice: Azure, Microsoft 365, Quest, SolarWinds, CrowdStrike, Mimecast, Duo, Palo Alto. I&#x27;m also curious what is the minimum configuration that meets the requirement of a PAM solution (can we make a low-level version of one out-of-the-box without having to purchase/install additional solutions)?

                              <span>How do you manage Backup Targets &amp; Selections in your IT shops? For example, let&#x27;s say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? 
 In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can&#x27;t be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it). For example, we do backup our home and shared folders, but we don&#x27;t back up application installation folders.

                              <span>Hey All, 
 I have just started a new gig working in a 99% Terminal Services Environment with the vast majority of users working off Windows 7/10 HP Thin Clients connecting via RDS to Windows Server 2016. 
 Users are logging into Thin Clients with Generic Auto Logins and then authenticate via RDC to their sessions. This is problematic for new users because you can&#x27;t change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.
 I haven&#x27;t worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.
 The IT Manager&#x27;s process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. 
 This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling &quot;some&quot; of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can&#x27;t login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. 
 My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. 
 My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?

                              <span>So it’s that time of the year where we start talking about calibration and who out of the team is the cream and rise to the top. Sadly out of my team of 5, only one is up for discussion for a promotion. The four other guys are just workers and I try to coach them so they can hit that next level but I don’t think they care or just think they are going to be promoted based on their employment length. These four guys work the best bankers hours in the business but if I need something pressing over outside of their time which happens maybe 5 times a year, 3 will never pick up the phone and will respond to my text hours later and the other one simply doesn’t acknowledge it all. The one guy who is getting promoted is super reliable and will not only answer my call but is happy to jump in if needed. Do people really think the are going to get a raise and promotion just because they show up and do their job? What ever happened to going above and beyond? These guys are going to be in for a shock especially with inflation and realize with their small bump, it’s actually going to be a pay cut in the long run.

 We also want to use Azure SMS service for emergency alerts and HR communication as many users are mobile only and not tech savvy. Azure SMS service needs the format as +country code 1235551212.
 One idea I have is to reformat the phones on extract from AAD into the country code format. I admit to not knowing everything, so I am asking for advice on this. Am I on the right path or are there better ideas?

                              <span>For the most part, Win 11 is pretty much the same, but there&#x27;s a few things I wanted to find out before continuing, particularly because the vast majority of our staff do not work from the office anymore.
  
While we&#x27;re still on Windows 10, I wanted to explore any/all new Group Policies for Windows 11. How do I correctly add the Win11&#x27;s C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions files to our SYSVOL without breaking Win10? Or are new PolicyDefinitions backwards compatible (ie all old settings are in new templates, so will still apply)? I&#x27;ve updated the policy templates in the past but only within the same OS - is it just the same procedure?
 
I think I read somewhere that Win11 is no longer supported by MDT as they&#x27;re pushing for InTune. I haven&#x27;t messed around with this yet, but is this true? We don&#x27;t use 365 (Google Workspace unfortunately) so having to subscribe/set up InTune would be an extra cost/delay to this whole thing.
 
If you&#x27;ve upgraded your domain to Win 11, how did you do this? Did you use WSUS to deploy the upgrade or did you recall the hardware to do it in person? I know the cleanest way is formatting but let&#x27;s assume that that&#x27;s just not an option for us.
 
Did your staff adjust/like the change to the center start menu/icons or do you/did you just take it back to the bottom left?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up some windows laptops for users to be able to log in for 2 hours(kinda like an internet cafe sort of situation I suppose) and I also need to figure out the usage stats on the apps so I can figure out what the frequency of certain apps are being used. Any suggestions on how I can accomplish this?

                              <span>Anyone has ever been fired knows the feeling around the office right before, the cold shoulder, the constant micromagging setting you up for failure. There is some higher vice president I brush past the told me the next IT guy they hired should be better than me.
 That’s good great skills and of course applying other places, but man I really hate American business practices. They just pile work on you and try and squeeze as much out of you As They possibly can. It’s all about is getting as much bang for your buck as you can capitalism baby!
 The work just isn’t possible there’s over 150 employees at my location and I’m responsible for helpdesk engineering projects, cyber security, giant software upgrades, and everything in between. Last week they denied my request for back up software so this company isn’t looking good anyway Financially. It’s best I hit the door.
 Edit: hey woke up to an interview request! Fuck this place! Did I mention they stole 40 hour’s vacation due to an unwritten policy.

 My company has a nice DR plan in place, but currently, said plan is only available in printed format at the homes and offices of all relevant persons.
 We’ve been thinking abou pushing out a pdf version to intune enrolled ios devices owned by the relevant persons, but are unsure if we can.
 How have you guys handled the distribution of DR plans?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m a Senior IT Tech at a rural ISP who&#x27;s just come in to replace a 3rd party support.
 One of the (many) issues I have is we have a handful of Linux users of which I&#x27;ve never managed from a sys admin view before (used Linux in personal life etc.).
 The issues i have are; 
 ​
  
They all want to use different distros
 don&#x27;t want to be managed via saas solutions
 want local admin on their devices
 they were given windows devices but 3rd party support to which they wiped and installed their flavour of Linux.
 CTO wants them to run Windows with linux in a Virtual box VM ( i dont think this is workable)
  
​
 My current thinking is, for them to all run the same flavour of Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 LTS) as these are both supported by Intune (in its infancy atm but hoping to get more control over the coming months) with AdminByRequest which i&#x27;m currently trailing with some windows users.
 I know no matter what i do i&#x27;m going to have an uphill battle as currently they have free roam of their devices as they&#x27;re basically personal devices at this stage! But from a sys admin and security viewpoint this is a huge no go! I want them to have the best experience to do their job as they can but there has to be a line where they are formatting devices! I know if i dont approach this right they will just format it again. Currently in the progress of writing a laptop policy for staff to sign also to stop them doing certain things without a slap on the wrists!
 Open to any other ideas or advice!

 ​
 I am stragling with setup WHfB on some computers in company. The hybrid key trust configuration is completed and basically it works flawless on all laptops. Though, on some desktops users cannot setup PIN due to error saying that this device do not meet WHfB requirements.
 Fun part is that if any other use sign-in to that desktops with his account, then the issue not exist anymore and they can set their PINs. So, despite of what the error says, I think it is some issue with specific users profile. I believe they tried setup Windows hello before the configuration was ready so something might be mixing here now. I tried to delete NGC folder, but that did not help.
 Is there any way to completely purge WHfB settings of user, other than complete deletion of his profile?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently troubleshooting an issue with our 2 on premise Domain Controllers,
 +6000 event 521 are generated every hour (Status code 0x80000005)
 From what I can gather, the issue could be that &quot;LSA Queue&quot; is full, because Audit events are generated faster than what can be processed. ( windows - Event ID 521 - Critical Logging Failure on Domain Controllers - Server Fault )
 Now, enabling the LSA event log, shows a lot of Event ID300&#x27;s containing &quot;Groups assigned to a new logon.&quot; and then the device/user and the groups assigned. Which to me seems of no value logging wise.
 ​
 Has anyone here dealt with that type of problem?
 Right now I&#x27;m looking into either increasing the LSA Queue, og maybe limit/remove that particular audit event.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 We have GLPI here and 4 domains.
 I need to pre select the domain for the login page (actually users need to select their domain) 
 Do you know any way to do this?
 Maybe via the url but I can&#x27;t find something which is working...
 Thanks! :)

 I haven&#x27;t begun to use IT Glue, just wonder if I store all the passwords inside IT Glue, is it possible to export my password when the server is down? Or what is the alternative way to access my vault, incase IT Glue is inaccessible?
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 Just wondering if anyone&#x27;s supporting Huawei devices that have suddenly started prompting users for having the wrong username/password in the past couple days.
 Have had a few staff in China with BYOD phones (P40&#x27;s) not able to get their work emails anymore using the default built in mail app. I don&#x27;t have such a device myself to test with unfortunately - only an old pre-trade war Nova 3i.
 Re-entering passwords hasn&#x27;t helped, re-creating the account hasn&#x27;t worked.
 Edit - Azure sign in logs show no failures, Disabling MFA doesn&#x27;t help, google has no suggestions, Huawei website lacks info and the Huawei subreddit has no posts complaining about this either, so wondering if it&#x27;s a Microsoft change or what?
 Outlook app proper seems to work, but it seems the default one has better contacts integration, like how Apple&#x27;s mail app is the only one that works for their contacts.
 ​
 Anyone else? Ta :)

 I need help using sysprep to create , capture and deploy the image with some applications to a flash drive. I can’t use MDT third party tools due to work limitations 
 I cant use a server, I just have a laptop with clean windows 11 installed and it has the applications that I need to add to the image.
 I did lots of research it seems like there are many methods with different applications . I want to use sysprep and maybe dism something that is built-in windows 11 only

                              <span>Hi guys,
 we&#x27;re trying to rollout some yubikeys to our colleagues and my boss wants to &quot;force&quot; usage as smart cards for windows 10 (ie: GPO Interactive Logon: force smart card or windows hello). This leaves us with a bunch of problems:
  
we have to use admin yubikeys to elevate local demands
 remote support has to have a passthrough functionality (currently talking with teamviewer here)
  
So my question is, do you guys know any middleware that allows a bit finer tuning of windows logon instead of goin all in with that GPO? I heard about SCInterface or DUO. Any experience with this kind of software? Is it even possible?
 Regards.

 However, can&#x27;t find the right criteria.
 Already tried the following:

 samba-tool user edit myuser [&quot;mail:noemail@noemail.com](mailto:%22mail:noemail@noemail.com)&quot;
 Has anyone tried to do this before?

 40*22*52+20*33*52 &#x3D; 80,080 &gt; 80,000
 Basically if a Help Desk worker put in 60 hour weeks, they would be above SysAdmin for annual income, even if both were doing the same (60 hours). And Help Desk would be not needing to be on call at all. The only thing stopping this, is Help Desk managers restricting total weekly hours techs can work (in theory). I know this is part of why companies have salaried workers in the first place, but it&#x27;s still wild to think many SysAdmins are making such a low effective rate per hour.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 ​
 I have some iPads in our WorkspaceONE that cause issues. The user using his Credentials to Setup the device (Didn&#x27;t clicked on: Leave Remote Management). Now their are logged in with the User Account but the device stuck in the Pre-enrollment Registration Record. And there is no linked device on the users accounts.

 Tunnel will come up, passes P1 and P2, ASA will get gets traffic, decap it, but never encaps. Everything is good on on both sides with routing and NAT. PT also shows a successful run which makes no sense. Not really looking for “have you done this” questions. I’ve built many many tunnels. I’m looking for someone that built the tunnel running exact same 9.8 code. 
 Don’t mean to sound like an ass. But I’m about through the wall here haha

                              <span>Any experience with Fortinet Access Switches?
 I have 20+ years experience with Cisco and would rather not stray but I am being forced to look at alternatives due to supply chain constraints and our timeline. 
 I am told they are not as affected by supply chain but am cautious that there may be a reason for that as if they aren’t as good.
 Curious about others thoughts.
 Thanks!

 Server: Dell PowerEdge R7525
 OS: ESXi 7.0.3
 Card: Intel E810-XXVDA4
 Switch: QNAP QSW-M5216-1T-US
 ​
 Hello,
 I recently got a new Switch (above model) and the Intel 25Gb card (not directly from Dell) and added it to our R7525 in one of the empty bays.
 The 25Gb connection worked for a few hours, but has yet to work again. It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn&#x27;t show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).
 However, I&#x27;m at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as &quot;Down,&quot; of course.
 And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.
 Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).
 Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.
 Link for proof it DID work : https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH
 Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I&#x27;m clueless at this point.

                              <span>Hi guys, first of all I&#x27;m not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.
 We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. 
 Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they&#x27;re a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. 
 So, in the meantime, I&#x27;m thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.
 Now, when I say &quot;core&quot; switch I do not actually mean it, it&#x27;s by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.
 We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.
 Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I&#x27;m asking Reddit: am I missing something here?

                              <span>The wikipedia article about TCP says:
  
Some TCP implementation use selective acknowledgements (SACKs) to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP&#x27;s ability to retransmit the right segments.
  
but it doesn&#x27;t say how common that both sides support this is. Is it like 50% of all tcp connections? 90%? 10%?
 Thanks!

The cabling, not the business. :) I&#x27;ve been slowly working on eliminating a lot of bad choices (e.g. cheap unshielded cat5 draped over fluorescent fixtures), but recently a supervisor has insisted that despite us never getting dinged on fire inspections for this, that &quot;loose electrical wiring&quot; is a problem and I have to act quickly on eliminating data cables poking through the drop ceiling to staff desks. I&#x27;m trying to find actual fire code around this specifically to avoid making this all a pointless priority. Any experts that can simplify this for me?

                              <span>Years ago we implemented a solution working with a Cisco guy who has now gone on to other jobs. I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.
 Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.
 Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.
 What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. 
 *edit to add some details*
 My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.
 At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.
 ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 I also have to NAT everything from one provider&#x27;s VPN to the client VPN.
 ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
 I don&#x27;t really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.

                              <span>I was starting a new branch office and deployed a single AP from my reserves until my order of 635s come in (lol.) I created the site, configured the first AP setup the Virtual Controller, SSID, etc. 
 I upgraded the AP to &quot;latest recommended version&quot; which was version 10.x versus the 8.9.0.3 the AP was on previously.
 All the options for configuring the VC in central went away. I asked my rep about it, and got this statement back:
 I&#x27;m afraid &quot;Virtual Mobility Gateways&quot; are not supported yet. Right now, the only thing we have is &quot;Virtual VPNCs&quot;, which you can run in Azure, AWS, Google and ESXi. 
 So before you blindly upgrade central connected IAPs in a VC setup, take heed.

Often times, it will just fail to update information displayed without a refresh or dumping browser data. It&#x27;s also not uncommon for it to just fail to load. Usually I can clear that up by clearing browser data, but now it&#x27;s just spinning when I try to log in. If I&#x27;m gonna throw all my eggs in this basket, I had better be able to get to it!

 So before you get out the pitch forks and tell me to call a professional, I have multiple times. I even got someone to come out and walk through with me, was promised a quote in a week and its been 2 months of crickets. We are in a very rural small town so it is often a challenge getting this sort of help.
 The back story is my very small family law firm is renovating the building next door to move our offices there in order to get more space. I personally ran all of the ethernet cable in the new building and am patching it down little by little. I am fairly comfortable with basic internet networking, certainly comfortable enough to meet the very basic needs we have. What I don&#x27;t know much about is the p…</span>

                              <span>Recently I had a Cisco AP (3802i) swapped out for an Extreme Networks one (AP250) trying to test something. Got the Extreme AP connected and it connected back to XIQ fine. AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say &quot;Cannot connect to X network&quot; or that they can&#x27;t connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they&#x27;re going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that&#x27;s in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. 
 ​
 The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I&#x27;m not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one. I know mixing APs from different manufacturers isn&#x27;t really ideal but this was the only room where we made this kind of swap.

Why did you / didn&#x27;t you migrate? 
 How did the migration of the rules go for you and how many rules did you have? 
 Did you migrate the rules from Panorama  Fortimanager or from the firewall  fortigate? 
 Are you using Fortinet SD-WAN (please provide scale) and how is it working out for you? 
 Are the SSL Decrypt performance numbers as great as fortinet says?

 We are working on implement management access for our campus and data center switches. My question is around how to handle this on L3 network (access-distribution-core). We have access and distribution switches in multiple building terminating to main core on L3.
 Do you crate separate vlan switches for each building or keep consistent network subnet or vlan ? what is the best practice?

                              <span>Hi guys it think I went to a rabbit hole and I&#x27;m quite unsure what type of serial cable is required to connect my Laptop to a SBC.
 I thought that all serial cables are the same eventual I found out that there are ; - Crossover or &quot;Null Modem&quot; - Straight Through Serial Cable
 My question is all crossover cables are Null modem?
 From the oracle documents the connection is required to have this pin out.
 Pin 3 --&gt; Receive Data Pin 4 --&gt; Transit Data Pin 6 --&gt; GND 
 I have found on superuser web page that I could use RS232 Null Modem Cable DB9F to DB9M which I bought from Amazon.
 Is this cable allright? Did anyone used this type of connection before?
 Are there any SSH terminals that could change the serial PIN out?
 Any help would be appreciated.
 BTW my laptop doesn&#x27;t have a serial connection, so USB 2.0 is my only option.

                              <span>For work I have to use &#x27;Checkpoint VPN&#x27; and that breaks my &#x27;local&#x27; network. 
 In briefly, I have 2 routers (one on 192.168.1.1 and the other in 192.168.1.254 ) and a home server. When the VPN is off everything works fine, both in safari and in chrome. When I switch on the VPN, on chrome I can&#x27;t connect to 192.168.1.1 and to the home server (192.168.1.80), although I can connect to the home server from safari, but not to the first router (192.168.1.1) BUT on both safari and chrome I can connect to the other router (192.168.1.254).
 I honestly can&#x27;t get my head around why on two browsers on the same machine the behaviour is not the same. 
 How can I solve these problems?

                              <span>Hello!
 I am little confused about DAC and Fiber usage. It looks like DAC is cheaper. Is there any difference between them functionality wise? I have to connect FW to my Switch with 10G links and they are racked up close to each other. Which one I should use for better performance?
 Thanks

                              <span>A little more context:
 I work in a team of 5 (manager and 3 other network admins). There&#x27;s kinda no direction or vision, feel like there&#x27;s barely any management from our manager (apart from a &quot;you doing OK?&quot; every few days). We&#x27;ve just got a few projects we&#x27;re each working on, but other than that there&#x27;s really no visibility into what&#x27;s going on.
 Everyone works from home, so it&#x27;s hard to feel like I&#x27;m even working in a team to be honest.
 Does anyone else experience this? Is it normal?

                              <span>We are being tasked with selecting several products for comparison for SAN solutions. We are heavily leaning towards TruNAS based on past experiences but an industry peer suggested JetStor. Beyond his suggestion we’ve never heard of this nor ever seen one in production anywhere. There is extremely limited information about them and what I did gather is that the underlying device OS is Russian developed (not that there is anything inherently wrong with that, but, you know…). 
 Anyone seen or heard of this before?

                              <span>I was not aware of TeamViewer&#x27;s little renewal scam requiring a 28 day prior notice. Tried to cancel several days prior to the renewal date. Told them to check my account, that I rarely use it and won&#x27;t be needing it at all going forward. The response was basically pound sand, you should have read the fine print, we&#x27;re doing this to you because we can, too bad for you that you don&#x27;t need our service. Anybody know how to effectively fight these creeps if one values their credit rating? They go full-on scam, reminder &quot;fees&quot;, late fees, and threaten collections. I wonder how many of their business customers realize what kind of people they are dealing with? I thought they were reputable until this happened and I started googling their business practices.

I know there are tools like this for policy enforcement and patch rollouts for stationary machines in an organization, but what is the general term? 
 TL;DR - MDM is to mobile as ____ is to PC?

                              <span>Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xcqz2r/solo_it_asked_to_do_engineering_work
 So a while back I, solo IT at my company, was asked to restructure the manufacturing processes in our companies manufacturing planning system (see original post for full story). As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.
 A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they&#x27;d have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.
 After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.
 I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I&#x27;m moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.
 I&#x27;m very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users &quot;not my problem anymore&quot; when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT. We&#x27;ll see how that conversation goes 😉

                              <span>I used to work retail for a long while and I would work sick because if you called off managers would be pissed and you would &quot;screw over&quot; your department, or wherever you worked.
 I remember other co workers at the time get shit talked about them while they were out sick. Like Managers would be like &quot;so nice of Jerry to leave us hanging like this&quot;. It made an enviroment where you NEVER wanted to take a sick day because you would be letting everyone down.
 ​
 Fast forward to now, I woke up the other day with fever and real bad sore throat. I sent an email to my boss saying I wasn&#x27;t going to be in and he was totally fine with it. I still felt guilty, and tried coming in today since I felt a lot better, but everyone at work was just like &quot;nah go home, we don&#x27;t want to catch whatever you had&quot;, even when I went to tell my boss I was going home, he was totally cool with me taking today off as well.

This was the result of an employee who does not want her manager having this ability. Her argument is that Hipaa related (and company related) mental health issues might be disclosed.

                              <span>They wanted payroll integrated into ERP. Both vendors assured us it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. At implementation time neither vendor would take responsibility for the integration. What they meant from the start is that it&#x27;s possible to use ETL to connect the two. I had to build it. Now it&#x27;s my baby and any time there&#x27;s a problem with it, I have to fix it. I&#x27;ve got a baker&#x27;s dozen babies at this point. Got an email from a manager the other day asking me to show him how to troubleshoot the solution that his department needs so that he doesn&#x27;t have to wait for me to be free to fix it. I was seconds away from suggesting that he could prevent the problems proactively by hiring competent people who wouldn&#x27;t fuck it up in the first place. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m going with this. It&#x27;s just a pointless rant. The real solution is that I need to train my tiny little team on all these solutions so that we can support them as a team. I&#x27;m just afraid that once I let them loose on my environment, they&#x27;ll just become another userbase that I constantly have to support.

                              <span>Hi,
 At my workplace we have a SCCM server which does have WSUS enabled on it, and we just got a couple of new Win 11 machines and there were a couple of issues we are experiencing with them being able to update from the Windows Updates section in Settings.
 After a machine joins the domain it will install the SCCM client and once the client is installed it removes the &quot;Check online for updates from Microsoft Update&quot; in Windows Updates. I know there are some registry entries you can change or delete to get it working but I was wondering has anyone been able to get that back wither it was from Group Policy or another method? Or if anyone else has dealt with the same issue they has a resolution to it? Thanks in advance!

 If I open a new ticket with a detailed description of the issue ...
 ... and there is an option to choose my preferred way of communication ...
 ... and I chose &quot;email&quot; ...
 ... why would your very first response be an email asking for my phone number and times I would be available for a call?!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had to stop myself 3 times this week from dumping my gear in my bosses office with a note that says I quit. But I&#x27;m a chicken and I feel too guilty to quit.
 I have been working non stop since July while the executives pat each other on the backs and congratulate each other on all the growth they&#x27;ve had. Including myself I have a team of 3. They have went from 300 people last year to 800 this year. Two helpdesk and me the &quot;IT manager&quot;. Or should I say field tech/sysadmin/network engineer/helpdesk Tier 2/security.
 They have opened up 3 new branches and bought one company. They gave one week lead times for each to be set up. They have me traveling and staying overnight all over the state for these. They now want a network overhaul by thanksgiving for cyber insurance purposes and a new time keep software customized, tested, trained, and deployed before December. I&#x27;m working through nights days and weekends.
 Maybe I&#x27;m just not cut out for IT management. I&#x27;ve started having heart palpitations. I&#x27;m terrified every time my phone dings. I daydream every time I drive to work on crashing just to get a short break in the hospital. My temper and anxiety are 0 to 100 at the smallest problem. Maybe I should be a potato farmer.
 I was getting paid $50,000 a year at the beginning of the year. I&#x27;ve been in this position for 4 years. I demanded more money and they bumped me to $70,000 and promise to double my bonus making it 10 grand at the end of November.
 I&#x27;m trying to just get everything they want done and hang on to get my bonus. Then push my guilt down enough to dip. I miss my family.

 Have done the URL rewrite, and the response from a test done by an auditor is HTTP 1.1 400 bad request, which they (their system) says indicates no mitigation has been done. Is that not the response desired or expected when implementing the fix above?

                              <span>Hi, we want to login via fingerprint in our domain. I enabled GPOs:
 - Turn on convenience PIN sign-in
 - Enable Domain users Sign-in
 - Allow the use of biometrics
 - Allow users to log on using biometrics
 - Allow Windows Hello for Business is NOT configured
 I can see that the policy is applied, but I can&#x27;t set a PIN (required for fingerprint) or fingerprint (Option not available). Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi everyone. I was hoping someone would have a good recommendation for a remote desktop solution in which the client could be installed on a Mac that only has user rights. I really like Splashtop for my own environment, and it has pretty stellar GPU-accelerated features for streaming content too. I have been unsuccessful in figuring out how to install the Splashtop client on a company-owned Mac machine and would like to figure out another solution (open-source and without subscription is preferred but any recommendation is welcomed). Thanks!

                              <span>Yesterday I enabled 2FA for all users via a conditional access policy. Majority had 2FA enforced anyway, including our admin account used for AD Connect.
 We&#x27;re now receiving errors with our Azure AD Connect sync - specifically:
 &quot;Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must enroll in multi-factor authentication to access&quot;.
 When I check the sign-in logs for that account I can see that it&#x27;s suggested that the MFA claim isn&#x27;t being satisfied which is required because of the CA policy enforced.
 However, that&#x27;s not the case because we have 2FA enforced and when going through the Azure AD Connect sync process, I&#x27;m entering the 2FA code we have in our 2FA app, which is accepted.
 We&#x27;re also able to log into the admin portal with the same account while satisfying the 2FA requirements.
 I&#x27;ve disabled 2FA on the account and re-enabled it, but this has made no difference. We also don&#x27;t have security defaults enabled.
 The user is also not part of risky users or risky sign-ins.
 Has anyone come across this before?

 First I would say, sorry if I use the wrong words for data
 Also my code in this post is just top of head, not sure it&#x27;s the correct syntax
 What am I saying, by learning about data?
 I am talking about understanding method of storing data below
 CSV files
 Excel files
 SQL
 Data validation and structure (This is very important)
 When I understood the importance
 At my first job, we did sadly not get to script, or use powershell because we had something like SCCM but with no code at all
 I worked in the govt in a small municipality
 But what happened often was we would get assigned a task, like example, keep track of 300 PC&#x27;s, their users, and PC names in this excel document

                              <span>Apologies, but I am not able to comment on the megathread for some reason. So I am making a post. We have had issues after installing the October updates on our DC&#x27;s. The issue seemed to prevent cross-site kerberos authentication over RDP for us. We&#x27;d see an event ID 4769 with the error code of 0x14(TGT was revoked). It failed until we uninstalled almost every update from October. Below is the event, the account name section was always empty.
 Is there something I have missed with these updates that would cause this? I feel if the issue was present for everyone it&#x27;d be a lot bigger deal and I&#x27;d see more information. However, I have seen no mention of issues for anyone else.
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.

                              <span>Got a Server 2019 machine running IIS with a few sites on there
 Site bindings are all 80 and 443 using the correct host names for the sites themselves
 Strange part - if I browse to the public IP of this server (it&#x27;s in Azure so I know it&#x27;s just this 1 server) I get a Windows security prompt asking for a username and password
 If I put in the creds of a legit account, it accepts them and then 404s
 If I give it wrong creds, it just asks for the username and password again
 I&#x27;ve checked every site and I don&#x27;t see anywhere on them that mentions any kind of auth like this (they&#x27;re not listening on the IP itself, so nothing should come up)
 Has anyone come across this before? Server has been rebooted and procmon isn&#x27;t showing anything useful for this

                              <span>Anyone knows of a good monitoring software that includes computer hardware performance. Reason is we recently bought this company and they have a few numbers of office staff. Their computer is somewhat ancient in terms of the efficiency and what programs they need t access. Our company don&#x27;t really have the extra budget to replace all their computers or to hire more ITs. I need something to help me monitor if their computers are failing and to give me a heads up. 
 I been doing my research but I want to know what you guys think. Thanks.

                              <span>r/Emailmarketing does not let me post so I want to ask this question here
 In our company we have two use cases for sending mails to a larger audience
  
Multiple times a year, we want to inform part of our customers (or all) of increasing prices for our products. Recipient count around 1000-1500.
 Marketing wants to inform customers of upcoming trade fairs
  
I have just now learned about different email marketing software and that there is a difference between a marketing mail and a transactional mail. I am under the assumption that for use case 1) we should not use our own mail server since the high amount of mails might put us on a blacklist - is this correct?
 If yes and we need an external tool for this, would use case 1) count as a transactional mail? All recipients come from our CRM system and had direct contact to Sales at some point in the past.
 For use case 2) I&#x27;m pretty sure this counts as a marketing mail and requires recipients to opt-in first. This is fine for use case 2) but would not make much sense for use case 1) as getting all of our customers to sign up for price increase mails is unrealistic.
 I would appreciate some further input to guide me in the right direction. Thanks!

 We bought a &quot;small&quot; 75 person company, they have on prem AD, and hybrid exchange and so do we.
 We&#x27;d like to merge all their users/computers/domains into our AD. Same thing for their mailboxes (they don&#x27;t use much else o365 related)
 So far we&#x27;ve set up the vpn between the 2 locations and we&#x27;re going to raise domain/forest level to match the highest one and set up the trust between the two domains.
 Which steps are needed to do this as smoothly as possible ?
 Thanks in advance

 Are there any jobs in IT that involve moving around and paying well?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been noticing recently that some new HP computers run a bios firmware upgrade during their deployment (using MDT). During the deployment, I install a recent cumulative update which I downloaded from the microsoft catalog. This is a rudimentary way to have a windows deployment up to date when delivering it. After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.
 The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:
 https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542
 Strangely, I&#x27;ve never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.
 Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?
 I don&#x27;t necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I&#x27;d rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.
 The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule. The default value is “Disable,” which does not require a password for this flash mechanism.

                              <span>Probably a long shot, but would really appreciate any suggestions- 
 I work for a training center that teaches MS Office applications, Windows, and some more technical classes such as SQL and Windows Server. Since all of our classes went virtual a couple years ago, I created a way of running the classes- I set up a Guacamole server to get the students into their lab PCs. We use GoToTraining for the classroom meeting. And finally we use Logical Operations for the courseware book &amp; materials. 
 This has worked ok, but it&#x27;s a bit clunky giving the students 3 different things to log into. Especially for our more novice ones, it can be a hassle. Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf learning system that we could use to combine these things?

                              <span>We&#x27;re going to shortly refresh our fleet of remote laptops by resetting Windows, configuring them with Autopilot and enrolling them with Intune for management. We currently deploy devices with MDT and are able to specify that the drive is Bitlocker encrypted with the requirement to unlock being that the TPM is present and the user uses a PIN. It doesn&#x27;t appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there&#x27;s no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?
 This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn&#x27;t find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I&#x27;m missing by using this as a secure solution? 
 We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.

Anyone else had this before?
 We have tried different computers, internet connections, and browsers. For instance, we had a 4GB OneDrive...from 3 separate attempts to download from different connections mentioned: 1.1GB, 700MB, and 1.4GB. We just had a 142GB OneDrive that didn&#x27;t even come close to finishing. 
 Is there a restriction we are overlooking that is causing this? Thanks

 Failed downloads, failed installations, failed verification to servers, failed verifying subscription status, failed keeping user signed in, unceremoniously exits on users.
 CS is trash from India. Run arounds, ineptitude, couldn&#x27;t have a fuck attitude and it shows in their responses.
 I think by now there should be great alternatives and I just want some examples that are deployed successfully without any issues.

                              <span>Hi,
 Recently i was asked to configure DMARC in our company.
 I see that we have a lot of SPF allignment issues (25% fail (Some of them are permerrors because we have 14 lookups and no spf flattening). But the biggest allignment issue is with outlook.com. This is weird because we have: include:spf.protection.outlook.com in our SPF record, also the Outlook ones are NOT permerrors.
 Some examples of the microsoft domains that the envelopes are from:
 eur05-vi1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur05-db8-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur04-he1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 Did anybody have the same issue or know what the solution might be?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Right now I am in a pickle and I need to figure out the best way to get tons of testing results from production lines, index them, and share them with our biggest customer. Problem is that I kinda have 2 days to do it. 
 O was thinking about a solution: Shared Drives &gt; Power Gateway &gt; Flow &gt; Power Automate &gt; Sharepoint &gt; Index &gt; Azure Guest account and be done with it. 
 Problem is that I do not have a Power license and I can&#x27;t get one that quickly. So now I need to replace Gateway with syncing on-prem to OneDrive and then run copy flow and everything cloud only. 
 What do you think? Install OneDrive on FS and manually put local folders to sync or create a VM, map the drives and run sync outside the FS? Or maybe a third solution? I am afraid that changing folders to Sync mode can f*up the NTFS rights, paths, dedup, or anything else. 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Does anyone know if this is an industry thing or if it&#x27;s just companies in my area? Every job I try to join has had an either 6mo-1yr &quot;we can fire you for any reason&quot; clause in the contract I&#x27;ve had to sign for onboarding.
 Edit: I didn&#x27;t realize this but I guess Montana(the state I live in) is one of the few states that isn&#x27;t an &quot;at-will&quot; state so if companies don&#x27;t have a probationary period (6mo-1yr) they have to actually provide a reason to fire someone, they can&#x27;t just fire people without cause.

                              <span>Hey guys, 
  
 i have next year my exam and i need a project.
 One of my ideas was that I could integrate a software to monitor our Switches.
 If a device it connected to a switch, then I want to see the following things: MAC-Address, IP-Address, VLAN-Tag and the Device name.
 My idea is that with the Software installed on a Raspberry PI I put one in every patch room. So that it automatically reads the port and I just need to enter the room.
 Maybe a web gui to see it from my office.
  
 Is there a Software you use? Or ideas you have to this?
 For my exam programming is not so necessary because its not the main part of my training for the Job. 
 So I hope there is a software I can use.
 Kind regards
 Lennart

 We don&#x27;t have IT people in the ground yet and need to do things remotely.
 Does the community have any good supplier to recommend?
 We can&#x27;t go with supplier like Amazon because of internal rules... 
 Some help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Created hundreds of GPOS and not once have I seen this issue.
 Long story short, insurance company wants us to up our password policy...fine
 Old admins used the default domain policy...this policy had a lax policy.....
 To ease users into things we created a temp policy and applied it to the MyOrgUsers OU. THe gpo was enforced and place on the top of the link order. However the default domain policy keeps winning despite it not being enforced.
 TLDR....Default Domain Policy that is not ENFORCED is winning and not letting our custom password policy apply settings. Also I changed the default domain policy password to not defined and that did not work. 
 Have to say in 15 years....this is a first for me.

 Is there any way to deploy SSL Identity certificate from central point to all machines that contains Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
 The same goes if we want to deploy CA certificate for browser in Linux machines
 Thanks for your input.

 ​
  
Free (and open source if possible)
 Able to perform active scan
 Timings related to active scans should be configurable in order to avoid false positives from IDS
 Able to work ad defined time intervals
 Last but not least, able to work with OT protocols (modbus, profinet, etc...)
  
Do you have any suggestion?

 We have the basic azure free platform in our company and am trying to retain user&#x27;s data (Exchange, one drive) more than 1 month, so I configured retention policy for couple of users as a test (pending to be deleted), from what I know and read the retention policy should work and retain user&#x27;s data after I (Unassign the license) &amp; (delete the user account) so two criteria should be met.
 But I don&#x27;t really understand the field which is says (Start the retention period based on) and there are two options (When item last modified) and (when Item last created) may I get elaborate scenario for this point? and what&#x27;s the effect of it I thought the retention period would start after the user would be deleted without license.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, &quot;The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.&quot; Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don&#x27;t need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. 
  
 Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. 
 Thank for any insight

                              <span>Hello fellow redditors,
 I hope you are feeling great and have a nice and quiet day.
 Let´s get to the topic: Many of my users (including myself) have noticed a horrible decrease of performance for the whole system, as soon as one starts to share his/her screen on a Teams meeting.
 Everything takes way longer to open up and the whole system starts to feel some kind of unstable. Everything you click on has a high latency.
 We have allready checked the performance monitor on the computers. The only thing that was noticable was that Teams consumpts arround 15 - 30 percent of CPU usage (for a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 as an example). Neither the SSD, GPU, RAM or other components seem to have a higher workload. It´s just the CPU, but anyway it´s by far not at 100% workload.
 I googled arround and found out that this problem seems to be well known for many people but nobody seems to have a solution for it.
 ​
 Does anyone else encounter the same behaviour of Teams or maybe even have a few hints for us or a solution for the problem?
 ​
 Thank you in advance!
 ​
 ​
 Edit// I forgot to mention that all of our computers at least have a 10th or 11th gen i7 with 16GB RAM and a m.2 ssd.

 Just wanted to ask. Anyone go for Microsoft&#x27;s Cybersecurity Architect exam? I&#x27;ve done all prereqs in preparation. Passed SC-200, SC-300, AZ-500 and MS-500. MS-500 probably was the hardest IHMO.
 What should I expect in SC-100, since it&#x27;s a fairly new exam.

                              <span>How many hours a week does it take you to manage 7 esxi hosts (35 vms total across them)
 Trying to get a rough time estimate for how long it takes to manage 7 esxi/VMware hosts with 35 total VMs (combination of windows and Linux) on them.
 We don&#x27;t need to actually manage the operating system of the VMs, just storage/ram/CPU and networking.
 The things I wondering about are how many hours a week it takes to manage: 1. Updating esxi hosts (new esxi firmware and os) 2. Updating esxi configuration 3. Updating OSVM configurations 4. Securing and preparing for security evaluation for esxi/VMware.
 Just ball park numbers or how many people you have working on that level of infrastructure.
 Edit: for people asking ... I am an admin. Management is telling me I need take over a new vsphere cluster. I am telling them that it&#x27;s a lot of work on top of the admin work I am already doing.

                              <span>I keep reading articles trying to understand MTU and people are saying if your ip MTU is set to 1500 that means the largest packet that can be sent is 1500. Now if you are getting fragmentation then you should lower the mtu. But the thing is fragmentation occurs when you need to split the packet into multiple in order to not go above 1500. So why would you lower the mtu to 1400 in that case it doesn&#x27;t make sense.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got eve-ng installed in google cloud with the following topology
 [33.33.33.33] vm-instance(mgmt cloud) [10.1.1.2] ---- [10.1.1.1] router [192.168.1.1] ---- [192.168.1.2] server (ubuntu)
 I want to put a simple web server machine listening on some random port (65000 for example) and be able to do the following:
  
traffic initiated from internet to 33.33.33.33:65000
 vm-instance (ubuntu os) should take this internet traffic, change the dest ip to 192.168.1.2:65000
 send traffic to router and router will forward it to the web server
  
My questions are: is this possible? and what nat/ip table commands would I apply on the vm-instance?
 ​
 ---
 note: The server can access the internet because I enabled ip forwarding and applied a NAT rule on the vm-instance (server &gt; router &gt; mgmt cloud &gt; internet)

                              <span>I am looking to replace 2 ASA5505s with 5506s, since the software version is different I basically copied the configuration line by line. The only section I am nervous about is coping the certs from existing ASA to new one is there anything I need to be cautious when dealing with migrating certificates. The ASA is primarily used for AnyConnect.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am currently going through Fortinet certifications (NSE 1,2,3 certified already &amp; starting my NSE 4) but I&#x27;m wondering if these certs will bring me any value in the future, I work in a small MSP with 200 ish clients and we use FortiGate for the clients. Hence, my intention was to complete up to NSE 7 (Fortinet Cloud/Azure Cert) to improve my knowledge.
 I&#x27;m wanting to know if this is worth my doing &amp; if it will get me noticed for future jobs in the long run over other certifications.

                              <span>What are some steps or tools to troubleshooting a Cisco corporate environment VPN? I have access to Cisco DNA, SolarWinds and ISE. I just started this job as a network admin and seems to me that users are complaining about file transfers being slower than normal for a variety of applications within the past few months. I read about different versions of Cisco AnyConnect causing issues and updated a user to have the most current recommended version with no success. We currently aren’t configured for split-tunneling. This is scheduled to be configured in the future. It seems we are getting a high amount of dropped packets but I am really trying to find a tool to find out what limiting the VPN connection/speed. 
 Thank you,

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been searching all over the place and I seem to be looking for a specific traffic generator.
 I&#x27;m wanting to test SSL decryption performance on two vendor firewalls at our DR site, with a need to generate x number of stateful SSL connections to say, example.com over time to simulate user traffic at our HQ.
 I looked at packet sender, but the packets always fall into the &quot;Do not decrypt&quot; bucket and don&#x27;t seem to tax the FW.
 Any thoughts or suggestions? TIA

                              <span>Hi guys. We are setting up transport links between our two sites. Currently we have a 100g NNI setup with carrier1.
 For this transport links we are getting L2 circuit from carrier2 and Eline on our carrier1 NNI. We want to run LACP on these two links.
 Problem: Our existing Arista switch (where carrier2 is connected) lacks support for LACPDU passthrough. Is there any economical 100gbe switch that support lacpdu passthrough? Or is there any way to make it work on Arista?

                              <span>Hello,
 These days servers doesn&#x27;t have RS232 connection. To connect to network device console interface (for example Cisco NCS-5501-SE) I&#x27;m trying to use some kind of &#x27;4world&#x27; USB to RS232 serial converter. And seems it works very buggy... the typing is slow and the letters are &#x27;thrown out&#x27;. Almost impossible even to login. So i&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;re any additional command to make USB-to-RS232 serial converter work better ? Because without converter it works OK&quot;
 To connect without adapter i&#x27;m using this command - and everything is OK:
 screen /dev/ttyS0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 When changing connection to USB adapter mode - same settings, i just change the device naming to USB0:
 screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 and the shit starts to hit the fan.
 I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s the adapter fault, some additional settings should apply ? Or the USB-to-Serial adapter suppose to work badly ? 
 Thanks

                              <span>I know network segmentation is one of those things that has no standard solution.
 We are planning to add two separate pairs of firewalls, one for data center and other for perimeter.
 The DC firewalls will pair of PAs 5200 and perimeter pair Fortinet.
 I am wondering which firewalls (DC or Perimeter) can be used for segmenting internal campus network. We have some internals VLANs for HVAC, BMS, IoT and Smart Devices and want to make them go through a NGFW as gateway.

                              <span>We have a distributed ISE deployment with 2 PANS and 3 PSNs, one of the PSN&#x27; SSL cert has expired. Our Internal CA has generated a new cert but we&#x27;re not able to add it back in as the Intermediate CA that signed the cert has renewed its cert 6 months ago. Thus the newly generated cert is not accepted as the trusted CA on the PAN has a different serial number (old one) to the one that signed new CSR. 
 As it stands, we will have to replace the Trusted Cert (the intermediate Win Server) with the new one. Then apply the new Cert to all the other PSNs, This means we&#x27;d have a total outage across our estate. 
  
Is there another way to replace the expired cert without doing all of them, Our Windows team have advised they will not be able to sign/generate a cert with the old intermediate CA. 
 Also while we do this, how do we ensure the pre-authorised machines will not have any issues? (we have authentication open on the port as well a &quot;authentication event no-response action authorize vlan&quot; but this will drop the traffic into a guest vlan.

                              <span>We are using Cisco DMVPN with a single hub with the CA running on the hub. Configuration on the hub has not changed since it was put into production more than 2 years ago. The last device we deployed on this network was in November 2021, and we had no issues.
 Today, I am unable to enroll a new device (same model, firmware, and configuration except for hostnames/ip addresses as the device enrolled in 11/21). When I run router(config)#crypto pki enroll CA_SERVER_NAME I am prompted for the CA challenge password as expected, after entering the password I am prompted to request a cert from the CA, which I say yes to, then it says that it has sent a Certificate Request to the CA.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a degree in IT. I really want to focus on networking and the like. I heard degrees are useless though and to just get certs instead. I&#x27;m not very familiar with the IT industry though. 
 I really would like to work as IT in manufacturing and have a degree already in an unrelated field to IT. It&#x27;s an associates in industrial maintenance technology. 
 Is IT different in manufacturing settings? What about PLCs and robotics? Does IT configure these?

                              <span>Hi,
 Recently i was asked to configure DMARC in our company.
 I see that we have a lot of SPF allignment issues (25% fail (Some of them are permerrors because we have 14 lookups and no spf flattening). But the biggest allignment issue is with outlook.com. This is weird because we have: include:spf.protection.outlook.com in our SPF record, also the Outlook ones are NOT permerrors.
 Some examples of the microsoft domains that the envelopes are from:
 eur05-vi1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur05-db8-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur04-he1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 Did anybody have the same issue or know what the solution might be?

                              <span>OK, first of all, I am still considering this and not sure if I should do it. I am looking for advise if this is feasible at all
 I am a IT professional, but mostly datacenter oriented. I did build some wireless networks; based on UBNT hardware (usually up to 100 people).
 In my free time, I help out NGO&#x27;s and like wise organization with my expertise. One of those NGOs is organizing a small conference (200-300 people) and have a desire to have a seperated WiFi network and not use the hotel network (1. because hotel networks are not always stable, 2. security is not always up to par/sometimes shared with other guests)
 I am now designing a potential network to see if this project is feasible, as tell them if I can do it or not.
 I am considering UBNT, as I know the software/hardware and it is easy to configure for me. Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.
 Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: 
 There are two floors in play here (F1 &amp; F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) 
 Floor 1
 - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP
 - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP 
 Floor 3
 - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each 
 Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. 
 People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. 
 Build up time, 1-2 days. It will be running a lot of wires.... 
 Looking forward to read that I am crazy to consider this. ;-)

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, &quot;The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.&quot; Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don&#x27;t need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. 
  
 Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. 
 Thank for any insight

 I was doing bit a a study on MP-BGP EVPN based VXLAN. I have these doubts which are still not clear after going through some articles. Can anyone please help?
 How does L3 VNI learns the Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes available on Local VTEP and also from Remote VTEP?
 For Remote Learning, i learnt that the VTEP learns Host MAC Addresses from Remote VTEPs through MP-BGP EVPN Type-2 route advertisements. Is the same Type-2 EVPN Route Advertisement used to exchange Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes?
 What is the purpose of EVPN Type5 Route advertisements?

                              <span>Hi Folkes, Can you please help me clarify my following doubts on TCP Congestion Control?
 While studying TCP Congestion Control, i came to know that Sender starts with Slow Start phase where it starts sending some amount of Send MSS and upon receiving acknowledgement, the sender increases the Congestion Window.
 Some Articles say that the sender adds one more MSS to Congestion Window and some say doubles it doubles up the Congestion Window. Which one is true?
 Also, when the Congestion Window reaches the Slow Start Threshold or some Packet Loss is detected, the Sender ends the Slow Start Phase and moves into Congestion Avoidance Phase.
 Can anyone clarify how is the Slow Start Threshold Value calculated? Is it a configurable option in OS Kernel or Registry settings?

                              <span>We&#x27;re finishing the implementation of a new Cisco 9800 (All CAPWAP) development using ISE for TEAP and guest cwa. A brand new ask is for contractors with non AD machines to be able to authenticate. Trying to figure out if the following is possible or a pipe dream.
 Contractors hit the guest network (default gateway is our Palo Alto firewall which handles all security and routing for guest). Redirect to ISE, log in with AD creds. Traffic then hits the Palo (since it&#x27;s the gateway) and the Palo then assigns access based on the AD account used in the ISE portal.
 So... 1. Capwap to controller cwa to ise 2. Login ad to use portal 3. Ise passes user info to Palo which then tags secpols by user name
 I did find this but haven&#x27;t had time to do any testing yet https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id&#x3D;kA10g000000Cm5sCAC

                              <span>Hello,
 I am running into a brick wall here with our DMVPN configuration that was originally setup by people long gone from the company. From what I&#x27;m seeing we have a traditional hub n spoke configuration with BGP as the dynamic routing protocol. On all of our spoke routers I can see two NHRP NHS&#x27;s Output below (The old ISP public WAN IP that needs to be replaced with our new ISP public IP &amp; and the 2nd that should stay). I am having an issue with where to go to re-configure this first NHRP NHS NBMA address.
 10.XXX.XXX.3 E NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority &#x3D; 0 cluster &#x3D; 0
 10.XXX.XXX.4 RE NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority &#x3D; 0 cluster &#x3D; 0
 I can see the locally connected route from the hub to the 10.XXX.XXX.4 in this case, but not the .3
 ​
 How do all spokes know about an NBMA address not being advertised by the hub? Does a brand new tunnel need to be created on the hub with the new public IP?
 Note - There is a switch connecting the 2 WAN IPs to the hub router.
 For whatever reason a &#x27;Show IP NHRP NHS&#x27; command on the hub shows me nothing.
 I also named this post dual isp redundancy and not dual hub. I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t have to create a new hub.

                              <span>Good day. I posted this same question in r/sysadmin a few days ago and got some good info, but I am seeking more opinions from this group now as was suggested. 
 We are looking at replacing our current Wifi environment (Ruckus) spread over about 6-10 buildings/sites with something newer. I am curious about the pros and cons of various modern systems (ruckus, meraki, cisco, ubiquity, aruba, juniper, extreme etc) and what fellow network admins have experienced in recent years. What do you like and dislike about a particular product, what should we look out for, etc? 
 I would like this new build to let us take a wifi first approach, so I&#x27;d like something rock solid, good performance and security, and hopefully somewhat affordable. We currently have 1gbps PoE switches, but once their lifecycle is up we could certainly get 2.5 or 5gbps ports to support future growth. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Background: we use OSPF as IGP protocol for the underlay and then BGP sourced by loopbacks in each of the VTEPs/pods.
 For the BGP process I thought I could only activate the l2vpn family because I need to distribute just MAC addresses, no IPV4 routes. On Huawei S5700 switches it seems that if the ipv4 family is not active everything stops working though. I thought I may generalize and just say &quot;activate the family you need and nothing else&quot;; if you need not IPv4 then shut it down.
 Is really like I descrived above or is there an explanation for that? Or might it a bug of the OS on the S5700? 
 TIA,
 Pan

                              <span>With people getting more laptops, there&#x27;s a need for more flexible connection types in our building. While NAC is somewhere in the pipeline, I wanted to implement a stopgap measure to help with people roaming through the offices and attending meetings.
 Setup is as follows: users can connect to a Wi-Fi as guests through a captive portal and after that connect to the VPN if they need to take their PC away from their table and cable. Works fine, but people moan about logging in twice to get to work. I would say it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, but if I can help someone out, why not?
 On our vWLC I&#x27;ve set up a pre-auth ACL allowing connections to our VPN endpoint. While I get hits on it, AnyConnect gives out a message:
  
The service provider in your current location is restricting access to the Internet. You need to log on with the service provider before you can establish a VPN session. You can try this by visiting any website with your browser.
  
Fine, I must&#x27;ve forgotten to add something that&#x27;s also needed, let&#x27;s try with &quot;permit any any&quot; line... Gets hits, still can&#x27;t connect or browse the web.
 I&#x27;ve tried it with my phone and with my laptop, same experience. According to WLC clients are in &quot;Security Policy L3 WebAuth In Progress&quot; stage which seems fine (and timeout is set to the max amount which is 4 hours).
 Anyone had a problem like this and solved it? I have no idea what else I should be doing to make this work.

Pulling an entire new run isn&#x27;t feasible right now. I dont know what these things are running so I&#x27;m looking for a layer 1 media converter and only need to connect a single pair. Google has brought up a few options, but wanted to see if the brain trust here had anything to recommend.

                              <span>So this is quite an odd issue I&#x27;m having and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s the right place but here we go...
 I am an electrical engineer and I worked in a program called SKM. In order to access it I have a USB stick that acts as a network license. It is plugged into my PC, my PC sees it, and when I open the software it checks to make sure before allowing access. I pay for a few seats of these software, all of which run through the USB network license. It maintains count of how many people are accessing it.
 I have a few remote employees who VPN into my network. In order to access the software they change a few settings in the SKM files per their (SKMs) direction, log into the VPN, and it sees the license, good to go. Except one employee.
 For some reason this one employee cannot &quot;see&quot; the network license once he is logged into the VPN. I went over to his house, brought my laptop, connected to the VPN, only to have the same issue. My laptop could not &quot;see&quot; the license either. 
 I have spoke at length with SKM about the issue and have tried every recommendation on their end. They have simply chalked it up to some network issue, which I&#x27;m beginning to agree with after troubleshooting. 
 The license uses something to check and i go to localhost:1947 to check. Not sure what this changes, just stating it as a fact. I&#x27;ve tried looking into the network adapter settings, etc. but I really don&#x27;t know if what I do will help as I&#x27;m not that informed on networking issues. 
 For the record, server side and user side firewalls are all off. Other employees do not have this issue, and neither do I when I am remote from my main office location. I am pretty green in this and know enough just to get into trouble, so be nice if the solution is something simple/stupid.
 ​
 Can anyone recommend any other steps to check or files/checkboxes to look into? TIA

                              <span>We are designing a network for our new site. It&#x27;s a big medical center with 6 floors. As you can see in the design, we have drawn a separate block for CCTV network. There would be approx. 400+ cameras (indoor &amp; outdoor) with high quality imaging throughout the building. When designing this network, we thought would it be better to implement a three-tier network access, distribution layer and core just for CCTV block. But the rest of the campus network remain collapsed 2-tier network
 In the end I&#x27;m only asking this:
 Would you implement a such architecture? Does it make a difference if we just separate the access for CCTV and connect them to just Cores and eliminate the distribution part.

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m working on a fairly large enterprise network (3000ish users under this core) and currently I&#x27;m having trouble with our core node. There&#x27;s a whole bunch of other stuff happening with it (like how I can&#x27;t ping any VSI - even if they&#x27;re up) but the most baffling to me is that I can&#x27;t ping the loopback address at all. 
 It&#x27;s a Cisco 3850 stack with 7 members. 1 master, 1 standby, and 5 line cards. I have Loopback0 configured with an IP of 10.0.255.4 and no matter what, I cannot ping it. Even if I console into the router and use 
 ping 10.0.255.4 source Lo0 
 it times out. Isn&#x27;t the loopback supposed to be working, even if nothing else is? All it has is the ip address command in its config. 
 Additionally, I can&#x27;t ping ANY VSI on the device, even though all of them are up. We have a few dozen and they&#x27;ve all been working as expected, but starting this morning we can&#x27;t ping any of them. Here&#x27;s an example :
  Interface Vlan148 ip address 10.0.148.1 255.255.255.192 no ip redirects no ip unreachables no ip proxy-arp  
 There&#x27;s also some netflow commands but they&#x27;re long and I didn&#x27;t really feel like typing them out. I doubt they&#x27;re relevant. 
 Anyway, a computer under Vlan148 (148.17) cannot ping its gateway (148.1) yet it DOES have full access to the whole network internal and outbound. I&#x27;m completely lost. 
 Even more weirdly, the device (when console&#x27;d in) can&#x27;t ping anything itself, yet still sends SNMP logs, registers devices in the arp cache, creates OSPF neighbor entries, etc. 
 This is just so strange. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 EDIT: Partially resolved the issue. Turns out VRRP was causing this somehow, as disabling the VSIs that use VRRP fixed the issue. Tomorrow I&#x27;ll have to figure out why exactly VRRP did this, but for now, it&#x27;s resolved.

                              <span>Our group has ordered a few of the Extreme series switches. My question is: on this switch, how do the shared ports at the end work? At first I thought they might be specifically for LACP, but it appears you can put any ports on the switch in a LAG. Also, if you run the &quot;show port&quot; command, it shows 28 ports, not 24, and you can put them into different VLANs. For example, you can have port 24 in VLAN 100 and port 28 in VLAN 105. 
 TLDR; are there functionally 24 ports on this switch, or 28?

Basically put 2 IP addresses on 1 server ethernet port and then turn off the retiring IP from that interface. If this could be done it would save us a lot of pain with having to have both a tech on our side and a DC tech involved in over a thousand servers.

While fictionalized, the series does seem to be based on real characters, real events, and what seems to be real tech issues/hurdles. 
 Spoiler alert if you want to watch this. One of the technical breakthroughs per the story seems to be using lossy streaming where they accept a small amount of packet loss in order to avoid latency. I presumed all streaming services do this, but of course Spotify development started in the mid-ish 2000’s and maybe they were one of the first. At any rate, the engineer proclaims this a wholly new protocol that they have patented. But isn’t lossy streaming simply UDP? Can anyone speak to what protocol Spotify supposedly patented (assuming the patent is not also fictionalized)?

                              <span>Hi All - we are moving from an onsite data room in a corporate office to a colocated facility. What are people doing these days as best practice? Are you just leaving a Firewall with an Ethernet switch and a UPS for the corporate users users to join a LAN while doing site-site VPN to the data center with a xfinity line or is there some new hotness to get this done? SD-WAN seems overkill for us.
 ​
 The corporate office is very close to a data center in Atlanta so ping would be &lt;15ms. User count in the office would be 15 tops, and they currently all use (including all of our servers) a single 100/100Mbit line confirmed with no congestion issues. New data center connection to the world would be gigabit, so plenty of bandwidth there.
 Do people still typically leave behind a DC and a NAS? Nothing but a firewall? Direct connect? We run light SQL loads, AD and VOIP, that&#x27;s about it. There are two other corporate offices in the US connected via site-site VPN and the other sites are OUs in Active Directory. In each site, there is a physical DC as well as virtual on esxi - and esxi obviously hosts all of our servers in each site. There is no shared storage for esxi, it&#x27;s all local to each site. Considering moving to RD Gateway model for the users who have been used to local LAN speeds for all applications as some are a bit rough via WAN (such as document management).
 Thanks for any ideas!

                              <span>Hi, wr are looking to upgrade our access switches for our campus.
 We have been running with multiple USW 24 switches, however we are in need of something a bit more reliable.
 No fancy features is needed. 
 Must have: -Double AC PSU slots (replaceable) -2x SFP gbe ports -PVST/VSTP -24x gbe rj45 ports (a poe alternative would also be good) -rackable -preferably fanless
 Do you guys have any recommendations for pure l2 switches that have atleast the above specs?
 My budget is about 1k euro per switch (preferably less) :)

                              <span>Okay, I think this is a straightforward question. I have a location in my EIGRP WAN topology with a secondary WAN link. I want this secondary link to advertise the LAN networks learned from the local L3 LAN switches, but I want to use the reliability metric at this duel circuit location to make routes advertised from the secondary links a feasible successor. 
 All Routers in the EIGRP WAN are only configured to consider the Default metrics (BANDWIDTH/LOAD) when calculating the best path.
 Now, describing this in writing has already made me feel like the answer is &quot;no&quot; because the other EIGRP neighbors would not use this new metric when calculating the best path. It may make more sense to modify the LOAD metric. I think this would mean the routes may not be installed as feasible successors, but they would be used if the primary Router failed. 
 What are your thoughts and ideas?

They are recommending me stuff to do (mostly internal resources) and I am going back to school for a cybersecurity focus but looking for some other good options to do on top of that. I am a sales engineer so I need to be able to more closely relate to customers. I am in the packet inspection for network performance and service assurance space if that helps with recommendations.

                              <span>Hi, me and my colleagues cannot come to a clear conclusion on this, we have some clients that are experiencing connectivity troubles when trying to use an IKEv2 VPN, the culprit seems to be a MTU size issue.
 The solution would be to change the MTU size but, we&#x27;re split on where we want to perform the change. Me and some others advocate that after a PPPoE session is established between a CPE and the BNG the traffic is ethernet so the mtu size should be changed on the interface we use for eBGP peering. 
 Others insist that is enough to change it on the bba-group that is applied to the template on the BNG.
 I am not sure why that would help, could anyone help clear things up?

                              <span>Hi girls and guys, thanks for taking the time to read this.
 I need to set up a camera system for a recording studio I&#x27;m working for. They want to install PTZ cameras in the whole studio, as well as monitors in two of the rooms, so that the monitors can show any feed taken from any cameras in the studio.
 I was thinking about buying Video Encoders &amp; Decoders and PTZ Hdmi Cameras:
 Camera HDMI Out --&gt; Encoder --&gt; Network --&gt; Decoder in the other room --&gt; Monitor HDMI In 
 But that means that for every camera, I need to buy an encoder. And that gets expensive really quick.
 My question: Could I buy a camera with an ethernet port and plug it in the network directly, then retrieve the feed with the decoder to show on the monitors? Or is an encoder mandatory to be able to do that? Do you guys maybe have an easier solution to this?
 Thanks a lot, really appreciate the help.

 How can i remotely change wan ip + default route to the fortigate with single wan port while remotely connected via wan without disconnecting.
 Option 1: Can i add secondary ip-address to the wan port and then add new static route for the new gateway?
 Option 2: Can i just add another static route (new wan gateway) for the new wan connection and then change the wan interface ip and then connect via new wan ip?
 Can someone explain step by step what i have to do. New wan ip is on different subnet.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I am using VRRP. (MAC and IP&#x27;s made up). 
 VRRP interface has mac bl:ab:la:bl:ab:la 11.11.11.1
 Active Router 11.11.11.2
 Backup Router 11.11.11.3
 Client is 11.11.11.21 with gateway 11.11.11.1. 
 When Client visit website, there is HTTPS traffic incoming. 
 What I see is that the Client recieve HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.1 MAC-address. But ALSO recieves the HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.2 MAC-address. 
 Is that wrong? I expected that the MAC-address of VRRP interface would be used downstream. And not sometimes the active-router MAC-address.

 I want to replace our monitoring tool PRTG with Observium.
 I already tested Observium and I was satisfied except for one thing : getting Top 10 bandwidth usage.
 Can I have it on Observium ?
 Thanks for your help

                              <span>I am in the position we all talk about on this sub which has received me the opportunity to fix something where money is not the issue. 
 First, the story, since starting in my role the team has used a shared excel file to manage our IP Space, we have over 300 Remote sites and 4 DCs... and one Excel file. I had mentioned time and time that eventually we&#x27;re going to go out, build a site, and accidentally use the IP Space that has already been reserved for a different site. Well, the day came, we had our 3rd Party go out and deploy the site as per our instructions, and bang, one of our other sites went offline. Two sites had been deployed using the same Subnet. The team did their testing, PVT passed and they left for the day. Staff started moving in the next day. I then get a P2 the next day, site down, I can&#x27;t login, and everything down. ISP says they see their side online. Then.. it all comes rushing in, it hits me and all I can do is just sigh take and sip of my coffee.
 So with that, all told and shared, what do we all use? I have only used phpIPAM before, it worked but it wasn&#x27;t great and crashed a bit.. I&#x27;m hoping to purchase something, easy to setup easy to use, and easy to maintain, the golden 3. phpIPAM was none of those things.

                              <span>Hi all
 I am kind of stuck with a customer where I have got myself into configuring one of the customer switches from cisco to aruba 6300F. (no reasoning here)
 Basically, stuck with this sample scenario and I am looking to see what should the vlan config look like on the &#x27;x&#x27; port on the switch?
 https://imgur.com/a/WBKKTD7
 i have tried doing the following and it doesn&#x27;t help. Can someone please give a hint from the image attached? Or maybe some documentation/video to explain this kind of setup?
 vlan trunk native 2 tag
 vlan trunk allowed 1
 and 
 vlan trunk native 1
 vlan trunk allowed 1,2
 and a few other combinations. 
 Thanks in advanced for help.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a multimode fibre run, and now I am looking into transceivers. Locally I can get 1310nm transceivers and 850nm transceivers for about the same price.
 The 1310nm transceivers state that they are rated for 2 kilometer runs, while the 850nm transceivers state that they are rated for 550 meter runs.
 Are there any downsides to using the two 1310nm transceivers on both ends? 1310nm seems to be better

CRITICAL Severity. This affects common configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable. Examples include significant disclosure of the contents of server memory (potentially revealing user details), vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or where remote code execution is considered likely in common situations. These issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We will attempt to address these as soon as possible.
  
As far as I can tell, this affects RHEL9 (and anything based on it) and Ubuntu 22.04

                              <span>I&#x27;m probably the very last of a generation.
 I wasn&#x27;t part of the earliest days of silicon valley. I grew up watching them, wishing I was just 10 years older.
 My first computer was a Commodore 64. Then I had a Packard Bell w/ an Intel 486DX4 80Mhz, Windows 3.11, 8MB of RAM, and a 600MB HDD. We upgraded the HDD to a whopping 4.2 GB, added another 16GB of RAM, and eventually upgraded to Windows 95. My first modem was 19.2Kbps. I watched the first &quot;dot com&quot; bubble burst. I was an unabashed geek who loved learning things, but I could never wrap my head around math skills. I was told there was no way I could make it in &quot;computers&quot; because of my weak mathematics.
 I went off to college, got a degree in English because I thought I was going to be a school teacher. Couldn&#x27;t find a job as a journa…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a System Admin at my current company and we just hired a new IT Manager about three weeks ago. Before even being caught up to speed he&#x27;s been constantly trying to gut all the solutions we currently have in place and replace them with solutions that he&#x27;s familiar with. To an extent it&#x27;s understandable but largely seems like he&#x27;s trying to pass business off to friends but that&#x27;s a different conversation lol. 
 One of the solutions he&#x27;s trying to implement is Ivanti which is understandable for MDM/UEM. Though he&#x27;s trying to implement other solutions of theirs that they don&#x27;t really excel at. Mainly for the reason of just having everything under one solution provider. I&#x27;m more of the mindset of choosing the best solution for that specific need (i.e. MDM, SIEM, AV, VPN). Each company and their requirements typically vary which requires a more tailored approach rather than a blanket it one. 
 My question is pretty simple; What&#x27;s your experience with Ivanti? 
 I&#x27;m trying to understand the company/solution and it&#x27;s pros/cons so that I can go into the next conversation with the ammo I need to setup the company for success. Whether that be understanding the benefits and going with Ivanti or arguing against it.

                              <span>To cut to the chase, the company I&#x27;m working for (~50 people fintech startup) is moving to a new location, and I (sysadmin, but practically responsible for anything IT related) am supposed to be in charge of moving our entire wiring and network infrastructure. To be honest I&#x27;m quite intimidated by the task, not only because the previous IT manager (who initially set everything up) did not leave any proper documentation, but also because I just graduated college last year, and I&#x27;m only in my current position because said manager left and the company has been unwilling to hire someone to replace him. In other words, I severely lack both experience and guidance. 
 So far, it looks like I have two options:
  
Convince the company to hire the previous manager as a contractor to help with the move. The negotiation will likely be difficult, since the higher-ups still have some ill feelings towards him. But in my (unexperienced) opinion, he should know best about what&#x27;s going on with our setup.
 Hire an IT service provider. I have never worked with one, so I am unfamiliar with pricing etc, or whether it&#x27;s even standard for them to take on something like this. 
  
Basically... what the heck should I do?
 Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Last year I was hired as a sysadmin after having succeeded as a sysadmin elsewhere. I replaced one who had basically given up at the role and let things go well beyond unmanaged. I spent the first 6 months improving every process I could, and met every project I was given. After that I thought of a few projects that I could work on that didn’t require any budget changes, since anything involving a cost I get stonewalled on. 
 But now it’s a year later, and as systems admin I still don’t have access to many of our systems. I don’t have access to our email spam filter. And when I’m on group calls involving my management I’m hardly given a chance to speak, and they do my work on the call instead of letting me, making me feel like I’m in some sort of placeholder position. 
 Having the title longer on my resume is nice, and work/life balance and the pay is okay. But I don’t feel like I’m respected or trusted to have the tools to do my job here. 
 It’s gotten to the point where I’ve begun collecting evidence of my requests that go unanswered, so if I’m ever terminated I can prove I didn’t have what I needed to succeed. Do you think it’s better that I stick it out for another year for that job history/resume experience, or should I look to leave as I’m really no longer learning or able to work on progressing my career here? I am studying to take some cyber security certs to help pad the resume though.

As a first review I can say that this application is not usable because the operator is horrible and the helm chart is not compatible with Openshift. How do you handle S3 storage in Openshift? Are there some alternatives we could check out?

                              <span>So I’m a system security engineer at my company. Sometimes we get the most random tickets assigned to our queue that don’t belong to us. So I’ll send it back to the service desk to figure out where to route the ticket. I had one of the senior service desk guys tell me “we aren’t the catch all for all IT issues”. Umm actually I’m pretty sure that’s the purpose of the help desk. To be the first point of contact for IT issues and either resolve the issue or escalate to the team that can. Also, I’ve worked service desk. I started from the bottom, so I know what it’s like.

                              <span>So deploying software MSIs via GPO is pretty straight forward. However, what happens when you get an updated installer?
 So let&#x27;s say in June the software vendor releases v1.0 of their software. Create the GPO and deploy the MSI, easy.
 In August they release v1.2 and you need to upgrade everybody. Are you supposed to:
  
Add another installer to the same GPO, leaving the original so that the new one is an &quot;upgrade&quot; to the previous version, or
 
Remove the previous installer, allowing it to remain on old machines and then add the new installation package.
 
 There are articles everywhere about making the initial software deployment, however, it seems nearly impossible to find anything on upgrading an installation.

 Does anyone have a lead on any reputable company (who is licensed to sell Juniper) that actually has some switches in stock?
 At this point we&#x27;d even take a couple EX2300-48P&#x27;s.

                              <span>This could be a little bit off-topic but I gotta ask. I used to be a well-focused, hard-working student back in the day. After I got into the field and started earning I slowly lost that focus. I mean I work really hard and focused at the office because I freaking love IT but I can&#x27;t focus to study. 
 I want to do a few certifications and even get my master&#x27;s but sitting down and studying is like torture now. Even tutorials don&#x27;t work. I get terribly (even intentionally) distracted all the time. I believe it&#x27;s because we are so used to stimulation when we work in IT (screens, terminals, GUIs, incidents), our brain gets bored when we study. Does that make sense? Have any of you encountered this? How do you focus on studying for certs when your brain says &quot;nooooooo!&quot;? How do you get that &#x27;student mindset&#x27; back and focus?

                              <span>Hi!
 I need a program to help me visualize and filter the Windows (Windows Server 2019) event logs related to files. I work in a small company with a tight budget and since this is for my convinience I don&#x27;t want to spend any money on this. I just downloaded ADAudit, which is great, but the file auditing is only in the premium version.
 Any recommendation for free software that can help me monitor the file events?
 ​
 Thank you very much!!!

 Our MECM running Version 2207 is having trouble installing and approving clients in our child domain. Clients discovered in our parent domain are not experiencing any issues. New clients in our child domain are not installed after being discovered. If we install the client manually, the device comes up as a &quot;?&quot; in SCCM and are not approved. If we approve manually, the device comes online.
 I&#x27;m not exactly sure when this came up, but I discovered this issue this past month. 
  
Auto approval is configured correctly under hierarchy settings
 Default IIS permissions for CCM_System_WindowsAuth Windows Authentication is enabled and set to HTTP 401 Challenge
  Boundary groups are set properly

 I&#x27;m fairly certain this is caused by the HTTP SPN for CCM_POST being registered …</span>

                              <span>I understand the purpose and effect of certificates within Trusted Root Certification Authorities, Intermediate Certification Authorities &amp; Trusted Publishers...but what about the others (Enterprise Trust, Trusted Devices, Web Hosting)?
 Are these all purely for personal preference/organization purposes, as in it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you have your certificates exist in &quot;Personal&quot; or any of these sub-folders? For example, I know Remote Desktop authentication certificates can be placed in &quot;Personal&quot; (machine store) and RDP connections will utilize the certificate even without the certificate existing in the &quot;Remote Desktop&quot; sub-folder.
 The reason I&#x27;m asking is that I&#x27;m needing to move some domain Server/Computer related certs out of the &quot;Personal&quot; folder to somewhere more appropriate and was wondering if the &quot;Enterprise Trust&quot; folder would be the right place for those?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to clean up my Group Policy .admx and .adml files but I am having trouble telling which folder and files are actually being used by AD GPO. Is there not a way to find the object path of a referenced GPO? I basically have duplicate files and want to remove them.
 My current folder structure on the domain controller looks like this:
  
Root folder with GPOs: \dc-1\SYSVOL\domain.com\Policies
 Then under that directory, I have about 80 folders that look like this {12A244F0-51EA-4C20-A1BA-68DF5BEA7E8E} and a PolicyDefinitions folder.
 Then, in PolicyDefinitions, I have about 400 .adml and .admx files and then a folder called en-US which has about 500 .adml and .admx files in it too.
  
I noticed when updating ADMX templates, if I over-write any, then I usually get errors when navigating the policies in the Group Policy Management snap-in. It will say something like the GPO is missing, then just restore the original GPO files from a backup copy of the folder I made to fix it.
 Note: I don&#x27;t want to delete all unused GPOs, I just want to delete the duplicates from the unused folder (whichever one that is). I understand that some GPOs wont be in use but that I also dont want to delete them because then they wont be available.

                              <span>I have a pretty typical two-tied Active Directory PKI setup with an internal web server that hosts my CRLs. None of the servers are accessible from the internet and it all exist on internal namespaces. All of my servers and desktops internally can get to the CRLs.
 I have had two sites using internet web server certificates getting flagged by Chrome with the error &quot;NET::ERR_CERT_UNABLE_TO_CHECK_REVOCATION&quot; while Edge is seemingly fine. Additionally, the error doesn&#x27;t present itself on Chrome for all users. The same person could walk up to two machines and get the error on only one, and a profile wipe will fix the error completely for a while. 
 I can load the certificate, copy the AIA and CRL locations and download them just fine. I have check pkiview.msc for any troubles and everything looks fine, I can&#x27;t seem to find any issue with the PKI infrastructure. 
 Chrome and Edge seem to be acting differently while unmanaged Firefox doesn&#x27;t like anything signed by my internal PKI. Would there be any additional logs I can check to find out why Chrome is complaining about not being able to check the CRL and/or can someone help me understand CRLSets and if they might be the problem?

                              <span>Hired as an “IT specialist” with a pay that is reflective of a level 1 helpdesk (45k cad) 
 3 Locations in Canada and 2 in the US. 
 I help manage all of them, there is a seperate person to manage the ERP and tht is all that they do. And then there is the IT manager and me, thats it. 
 I do all the onboarding, user setup, help desk. Manage the cybersecurity side of things (firewalls, endpoint security etc. I roll out new apps, set and configure gpo’s. Help with backups and restoration( had to manually free up space on the backup server because the manager forgot to before he went on vacation). And recently have been helping the erp guy with the operations side of the iseries because he isn’t good at it/can’t do it. When the manager isn’t here, everything falls to me.

                              <span>Hi, had a security breech at the weekend, I need to find out what the detault days to delete for the log files are when a windows DC is implemented, I&#x27;ve been told it was set to 2 days and I&#x27;m nearly sure its longer by default. Which would suggest a change from default (to cover tracks).

 I&#x27;ve managed to narrow it down to his laptop...all the lockouts are caused by that one device.
 Has anyone, any clue on how to identify the specific process/application/task that&#x27;s causing it to lock?
 TIA

                              <span>Hi We got a Sharepoint Online Assets Library which contains all of our Office templates.
 When I update or reupload a template, it doesn&#x27;t sync to people who has been using this template before. It seems to be some kind of cache because if I rename the document to something else, it works fine.
 The templates have never been replaced or updated before. So i&#x27;m curious on how to manage these templates... it&#x27;s not very intuitive to give the template a new name every time it has been updated.
 I have tried to clear etc. Word cache but it doesn&#x27;t work.

 cat &gt; /etc/sysctl.d/disableipv6.conf
 net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 &#x3D;1
 net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 &#x3D;1
 EOF

 but it somehow messes up because the file created looks like this 
 &#x27;disableipv6.conf&#x27;$&#x27;\r&#x27;

 Problem is: We&#x27;re also sending internal mails from i.e. our VeeAm Backup Server which also gets flagged as external.
 Now, to exclude mails from &quot;ourdomain.com&quot; I&#x27;d like to test if spoofed mails won&#x27;t get flagged although coming from outside our org. Is there a legit (and maybe even free) tool or website to use for this?
 Most I found looked VERY fishy.

 I know the first week is all insurance and getting signed up. I am a big believer in documenting and observing for making big changes but maybe I need a different perspective on what other people value or would start off with. thanks and curious to see what people say.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working in a tiny company supporting other small companies in the retail sector, jewelry stores, clothing stores... some have offices that have windows server servers (2012, 2016)... no cloud or aws etc... I feel stuck in time...
 I&#x27;ve been in this company for years, a few years ago my wish was to do the mcsa certification and get a better job in this area.. but I received the news that Microsoft had endorsed this certification, at the time I felt that azure , cloud was something far away for me , and I continued without acquiring new knowledge. 
 what would you recommend me? 
 thanks

                              <span>... and I am baffled that I did. I tell my clients all the time to be careful with suspicious mails. And I guess this time I wasn&#x27;t careful enough. 
 The original mail seemed to originate from their web hosting provider stating a new invoice was ready for download and contained an HTML file as an attachment which should be the invoice itself. It was forwarded twice within their org, then to me with a request for credentials to access that site since it prompted for them. The website was an absolute perfect replica of the genuine login site and prompted for credentials. I filled it out planing to download the invoice and send it to them, since I knew the sender didn&#x27;t have them. However the login didn&#x27;t work. After checking the url I was on the correct site of the provider. What I didn&#x27;t notice at first: I only got redirected there after entering the credentials. For some reason I got suspicious at that point and checked the HTML file which contained some encrypted java script. Of course I immediately changed the password of the account and fortunately found no suspicious activity. 
 However I am still in shock how stupidly I behaved.
 Edit: just to add, that Mail did not trigger any spam filter nor did opening the HTML file trigger the antivirus or the webfilter of our firewall.
 Edit 2: just uploaded the file to Virustotal and it seems it&#x27;s actually a trojan. However it&#x27;s still undetected by our antivirus solution. This file was first uploaded to Virustotal a week ago.

                              <span>Why do companies insist on sending out their mass e-mails, that, yes we&#x27;re expecting, in formats like this:
 bounces+584721-8c22-USERSNAME&#x3D;OURDOMAIN@em2170.THEIR DOMAIN.neton behalf of THEIR COMPANY NAME surveys@THEIRDOMAIN.net
 So unless I whitelist your whole domain, it WILL always get blocked as spam. Why can&#x27;t you just send it via your surveys@THEIRDOMAIN.net address? Which I&#x27;ve already cocking whitelisted!
 Having never done this before myself so is this laziness or is it general practice and we just have to accept it and whitelist their whole domain?

 i already made a simple form connected to power automate, and it sends the inline manager a mail when an employee submits a request, and they can approve or decline the request from teams/outlook.
 is there any other way to do this? my deadline is in 2weeks

                              <span>I am running into an annoying issue at work, we deploy laptops with autopilot and intune. When we start a new laptop and connect it to our network it get stucks at the windows message “sit back and relax while we work our magic” if we leave the laptop on it stays stuck forever.
 What we found out us that as soon as we remove the docking connection we get prompted to connect to wi-fi and then autopilot kicks in.
 The wi-fi is public so we looked at our firewall logs to see if the fact that deployment get stuck only when on LAN connection is caused by firewall but we don’t see any blocks.
 Is there anyway I can get to some logging on the laptop to see why it is stuck?

                              <span>Hopefully there is someone familiar with the ESE/JET engine who could confirm about cleaning up ESE database transaction log files.
 One AD CS CA is having a rather large C:\Windows\system32\CertLog directory with numerous ESE log files. It seems to be a rather known issue that AD CS does not (sometimes?) clean up the ESE log files, for example:
 https://www.sysadmins.lv/blog-en/database-log-files-are-not-truncated-when-you-perform-a-full-certification-authority-database-backup.aspx
 The reference is contradicting itself. It says &quot;no workaround&quot; but also gives a command that &quot;identifies the start log file number to protect&quot;. I had already figured out about as much by using esentutl but would like to confirm I am getting this right.
 In the above linked example all logs with sequence number smaller than 3B, meaning edb00001.log until edb0003B.log could be removed, right? What about edb.log, that one must not be touched? Or one cannot just delete any log file and have a working database?
 It should be rather simple to make a script that:
  
Run esentutl /mk edb.chk
 Parse the Checkpoint line for sequence ID
 Delete all edb#####.log files with ##### smaller than value from step 2
  
I have been searching for a while and could not find one website about actually doing this. Surely someone must have done this before, it does not even look that complicated?! Several hits for just brutely stopping certsvc and deleting all logs which is not what I want to do if this can be done &quot;right&quot;, by just deleting unnecessary log files.
 I guess I could just download the whole CertLog and play around with it, see what happens. Will take a while, it being multi-GB...

                              <span>I am getting so frustrated with a certain vendor&#x27;s customer service every time I report a problem with our laptops. They drain so much energy out of me and send me into loops just to &quot;fix&quot; software problems, which are 99% hardware problems and we just need someone to change the parts that&#x27;s it. I have such a hard time to get through to those people even though I try to fix everything software related beforehand, but the support always wants more from me. 
 How do you guys deal with customer support? My manager says I should be harsh, but I don&#x27;t feel like being rude to a guy who is just doing their job and fend off stupid problems. Maybe I am just too soft, I am lost at this point.

 5 days ago, I made a thread about several issues I had with my new setup of Windows 11, mostly about printing issues:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y8s2x0/windows_11_unusable/
 Well, diving deeper into that, found that the print queue is unmanageable from the Config app, dropping the message of the title, and this seems to be the root of the problem. It also seems that I&#x27;m not the only one with the issue:
 https://answers.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/forum/all/necesitas-una-aplicaci%C3%B3n-nueva-para-abrir/fdb08d24-a862-40a5-9592-a98c6ffbbe2d
 https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/yaj17o/print_spoolerprint_queue_suddenly_shows_this/
 Any fix (powershell command?) to assign the link type to the app?
 And second...
 Given that both results are from the last 7 day…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I am confused: back then we moved from scripting (.bat) to nice Group Policies for connecting network file shares.
 Now, as I am digging deeper into M365 and Intune I can&#x27;t find a nice, as easy to use solution, like the Group Policy.
 As I see from my researches, we are now back at scripting the network file share connection but now with PowerShell?
 So even in scripting: We move from a Net Use &quot;One Liner&quot; to a 317 Line PowerShell Script which adds a local task for reconnecting a single drive? (using https://intunedrivemapping.azurewebsites.net/).
 Maybe I am thinking the wrong way, because modern management and cloud is totally different but:
 Microsoft offers Azure Files as a File Server replacement. These Shares also need to be connected.
 I have a Client with 5 TB of data, whic…</span>

                              <span>No, it´s not about their printer line, that topic has a special place in my &quot;not to be opened again&quot; box. 
 It´s been nearly two decades since I last bought any HP product for good reason but as life goes on and people think it´s ok to purchase HP products I have to troubleshoot them. 
 First the server guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the network guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the software got blamed. So I made contact with the vendor who told me that the network guy needs to get his hands on the problem. The logs stated that also, at least the software ones. So I conceded and went back to troubleshoot even though I was pretty certain it´s not the network, most certainly not the server and probably not the software. It runs on several devices without any issues. 
 After another sleepless night it dawned to me that the only difference is, that the software is installed on a HP desk. So I grabbed just another device, slapped the software on and it runs. It just does, what it´s supposed to do, it works. So it´s the HP trash again. Why? I don´t know. I wish I could say that every single HP device is in it´s own contained part of the network, isolated from the rest of the world and hidden from any tech guy but they are everywhere and the rules applied are the same as for all the other stuff. The one and only difference is, they are HP desks. 
 I honestly don´t know who made the cost-benefit analysis or if there even is one, but I´d like to see which maniac decided to buy HP products.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve ran into the manual folder shuffle in exchange all too frequently over the last few years. 
 Awhile back, I found this random script online made by David Barrett - I think this is the single most powerful and complete script I&#x27;ve ever found via ze google lifeline.
 I encourage you to read the github and check it out for yourself.
 Merge MailboxFolders.ps1 · David-Barrett-MS/PowerShell-EWS-Scripts Wiki · GitHub 
 ​
 I just really wanted to take a moment and publicly thank this guy - Hopefully he reads r/sysadmin
 You could package this script into a full app and make a fortune -- instead, this guy updates and provides this script for free for anyone to benefit.
 and sure enough, it supports oauth/modern auth
 Thank You David Barrett. You have saved quite possibly hundreds of hours of my life.

                              <span>I am a T1 Help Desk agent taking in calls to do the usual T1 things. Password reset, clearing cookies/cache, having to point out their lack of VPN connection is why you can&#x27;t get access to this resource/intranet, etc. I understand this is mostly a sysadmin sub and if this breaks any rules or frowned upon for non sysadmin to post, I&#x27;ll delete.
 I work remotely so physically seeing and talking and getting to know your local sysadmin is even harder than it is.
 I had simple questions to ask him to gain some personal perspective on how he got to where he is now.
 And I was immediately shot down by my supervisor, being told to please do not contact him, only supervisors and up can do that.
 And you know what? I sorta get it. I would imagine having 10s or even 100s of agents contacting you could get tiring.
 But it still sucks that I&#x27;m pretty much forbidden to gain a little wisdom from him. Oh well.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a tad confused by Microsoft&#x27;s documentation on this topic.... I&#x27;m looking at doing a proof of concept for a possible project to migrate ALL user, group, resource data from one tenant to another and there appears to be two different pathways - both updated within the last 6 months by Microsoft and neither has any reference to the other (with the exception of recommended content).
 ​
  
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrate-mailboxes-across-tenants vs https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-mailbox-migration?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide 
  
 ​
 Which is the better method?
 Notes: 
 The primary domain in the source tenant will remain as the primary domain for the users migrated into the target (and ONLY for these users, everyone else already on the target tenant will use the company&#x27;s normal domain).
 The source tenant is only 3 months old but user accounts contain data and calendars migrated from an on-prem Kerio server.
 Both tenants have their own Mimecast Email Gateway, but after migration is complete, there will be only the target&#x27;s Mimecast service.

                              <span>HOW???
 Please share with me something :/ I have been just a hobbyist in computers since I was a kid, I guess. Building my first computer at a young age, growing in to help-desk after flipping them burgers for X years after college.. A typical story, I assume...
 Was on helpdesk in large org for 5 years, now I have been a SysAdmin for a year and some change (Age 31) and I have been overwhelmed by the sheer infinite amount of things you need to learn. My feelings gravitate to &#x27;why am I even doing this?&#x27;..
 My boss is amazing. My team is amazing. I have finally landed a kush job with a description that I thought I always wanted (small shop now doing some networking, security wherever, being new to virtualization, everything a sysadmin would do with an IT team of 3 in the datacenter and 300 employees).
 My motivation is fucked. Every day I want to do good for my co-workers and boss but I just don&#x27;t feel like I have it in me to learn and think and be creative every day... I just had a very overdue vacation a few months ago and I already have this burnout feeling.. whyyyy.. I question if I am even interested in IT.. working in the dirt or cleaning toilets can NOT be a better deal for me but it is what I fantasize about. something mindless...but idk.. I can continue to rant but I think anyone reading this get&#x27;s the point. Work is getting hard and I want to be motivated.
 (Possible remedy? Can changing my habits and routine give me a better outlook? ie start waking up earlier and getting some exercise. Can I coax my mind in to enjoying this job by employing other changes in different parts of my life?)

                              <span>Hey all - 
 Have had a s2s tunnel built between site a &amp; site b for quite some time... never seemed to be a super big issue, performed well, but lately I feel like there are times where bandwidth is just yuck... I know it&#x27;s a broad question, but I have a maybe 7 subnets going across this to 3 or 4 other subnets at the secondary location. AES256 and SHA256 for algorithms with DH14. Not sure if this is a factor? But looking to understand if this is a best solution for site to site locations still or if there is something else I should be pursuing... This area is not my number 1 - so forgive me. Both units are Fortigate. Both sites are on 1000/1000 fiber... Just seems like I can count to 4 before I see anything load up like an SMB query on a file server... etc... but latency between sites is a solid 5ms.... 
 ​
 Cheers

                              <span>I have no affiliation with this site, but it&#x27;s pretty gnarly, and as it seems to be geared more towards the IT crowd, I thought I&#x27;d share it as a job resource for anyone looking at a career transition for whatever reason. 
 I originally saw it listed over on /r/internetisbeautiful. 
 This guy made a site that scrapes Twitter for job postings in the past 48 hours, and sorts and publishes everything. It&#x27;s got built-in filters for location, remote, categories, etc.

                              <span>Hi all
 so i am tasked to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 and only using 1.2 for security reasons on all our windows server machines 
 this is what i am going to do, please correct me if i am wrong 
 1- Disable TLS 1.0, 1.1 from internet options 
 2- Run power-shell script to set the registry keys as described in this url
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-tls-enforcement#powershell-script-to-enable-tls-12
 again, the reason is to keep our windows servers secure as server and client there is nothing specific
 thanks in advanced

                              <span>I was at a position for about six years then left for greener pastures. About four months after I left I got a call from one of the users. She called just to say thank you and she really appreciated the support I had given her while I was there, and that was it.
 She was just one of the 300ish users I supported, never had any extensive dealings with her, never anything beyond answering the phone/Teams when she called for support.
 Meanwhile, the guy who owned the company, the guy who was supposedly my boss to whom I was supposed to report to, after keeping his company running 24/7 for all those years never talked to me while I was there, &quot;negotiated&quot; with me when I turned in my notice by sending verbal messages through somebody who then relayed them through HR who then verbally passed the message to me.

                              <span>Yes it happened. This gentleman, let&#x27;s call him G, is part of the operations and is good at tech. I had an hour discussion with him on how important is the security for the organisation and how are we planning to implement ir. He was really impressed with my ideas and knowledge. Right after our call he sent an email to my managers, company&#x27;s CEO and HR head. HR head then later forwarded this email to all 2000+ employees.
 G you really made my day and gave me so much motivation to work here.
 Of course I am hoping for a good raise in salary in next appraisal cycle else I will switch Lol. 
 Keep up the good work dear SysAdmins.

                              <span>Do I need to say more? Has anyone has the displeasure of dealing with them? While I&#x27;m sure their service is wonderful for those who need it, their attempt to win clients by attrition has completely blacklisted them from our acceptable vendors to use. They call, they email, they leave voicemails. For 5 years this has been going on, if not longer. I tell them we don&#x27;t use VMWare, and I tell them we aren&#x27;t interested and yet they still harass us. And that&#x27;s the best term. It&#x27;s harassment at this point.

                              <span>Early last week PC across our org starting having one of three types of error:
 1 - PC would BSOD, possibly multiple times with no obvious cause and disparate error codes
 2 - Every application would crash in turn with an error indicating issues with Trend Micro&#x27;s dlls
 3 - PC would boot to a black screen, but be online (even on wifi) and respond to remote commands (though any form of remote control would still yield a black screen)
 Eventually issues 1 and 2 would evolve into 3 in many, though not all cases. An upgrade of TM&#x27;s client was complete or in progress at the time of the first presentation, which coupled with issue 2 made us conclude a botched update was the cause.
 Unfortunately repair didn&#x27;t seem to work and TM&#x27;s support suggested we proceed with a hard uninstall using their CUT program. The problem was this took an extremely long time (over a day in one notable case). We dug through the logs and discovered CUT was attempting dozens of tries with long timeouts for each operation, before eventually failing and moving to a more aggressive option (ie removing a service after failing to stop it).
 We discovered that an ini file was created upon launching the CUT executable and we could, if we were quick enough, replace that ini file with a modded one that reduced timeouts and # of attempts to something more manageable. This brought down removal time from hours to about 20 minutes per machine, which could be run in parallel.
 On some machines CUT would complete on first try, others would require a second application even though CUT logged its successful completion.
 After that we could reinstall the TM client with no further issue.
 TM support told us this has never happened before (when does it ever) and we&#x27;re the only ones reporting it (what good luck), so I thought it&#x27;d be useful to put it here for anyone that should happen to suffer this issue or something similar.

                              <span>Has anyone had any success reinstalling/resetting Windows Defender in Windows 10?
 We use crowdstrike as our main AV but would like to start using scheduled scanning on our devices per recommendations from our SoC.
 Our devices are in Intune, and I’ve found out that Defender will automatically run in “passive Mode” if we onboard our devices to Defender for Endpoint.
 This works fine on our newer deployed devices (via autopilot), but it won’t work on our previous ones that were “imaged” using MDT. I have a feeling that the previous image broke defender somehow since it included crowdstrike on the install, rather than installing after enrolling via autopilot in the new deployment.
 I’ve tried the commands I’ve found online to reset the app using AppX, re-registering it again using add-appx using the built in windows 10 manifest.xml, and resetting the app via “Windows Settings”. I’ve also tried restarting the Windows Defender service, modifying registry entries to enable “passive mode”, and simply enabling periodic scanning on the device itself. Windows defender seem to just won’t start at all. I checked group policy and Defender is not blocked.
 Any other ideas you guys may have to get defender running again? I could try uninstalling crowdstrike, but thats not really feasible if it’s the only way to deploy it on our older devices.

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid-career in my 30s and about to be unemployed in a few months. I know I can get another admin or DevOps type job but I&#x27;m curious what is folks&#x27; thoughts on what will be new in-demand roles in IT in the coming years.
 I&#x27;m not talking about learning an app (for example Chef and building cookbooks) or generic stuff like automation (for example learning Python for scripting). I&#x27;m thinking like where will AI be or quantum computing and what kinds of roles there will be for the admins.
 Big industry-changing stuff like when Windows 95 came on the scene and the world hustled to move to distributed systems hiring anyone who could spell PC. Or when Amazon released commercial cloud computing and suddenly the &quot;cloud engineer&quot; title was the fat paycheck.
 Or maybe I just say screw it to cutting-edge tech and get a job supporting the Mainframe and COBOL? That stuff will be around long after I&#x27;m retired. Plus from what I see folks to support that is in very high demand.

 I was doing MX switch last night, because I was changing security email provider to MS, and I forgot to remove a transport rule in Exchange Online. Now, I have a lot of incoming emails piled up as Failed due to transport rule blocked them all.
 What can I do? How can I see or recover these emails?

                              <span>Hello!
 ​
 Im a entry-Level Sys-Admin and doing a Server upgrade at my workplace right now.
 We are switching from a Terra 7220 G1 to a 7220 G4, and are using VMware for Virtualisation.
 The G1 runs ESXI 5.5, which I plan to Upgrade to 6.5/6.7 before migrating the VMs to the G4 Server, which is expected to run ESXI 7.X on it.
 ​
 Therefore i need to know wheter my Hardware is compatibel with ESXI 6.5
 I already went to Vmware Hardware compatibility Guide to check it, but the list ends with a Terra G2 modell. 
 ​
 Does anyone know how to find out if my G1 is compatibel?
 Its equiped with 2x Intel Xeon E5-2600-v2 Series, which are supported by ESXI 6.5/6.7.
 Or do you think I should just try to upgrade?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll get straight to the point, we have been receiving bulk spam emails (100-400) at a time at my job using a legitimate email address from one of our users. Exchange picks up on it and blocks the legitimate email from sending emails since it is flagging it as spam. This disables and user and the only way to get around it is to create a rule in Exchange with a &quot;body contains&quot; rule. We use MWB Nebula to locate vulnerabilities and I do not see one on our Exchange server. I am a Jr. System Admin so Cybersecurity is something I am learning. I believe this would obviously be a Blue Team issue. We do have a vendor we work with for issues like this, but would like anyone&#x27;s input if possible. Any more info just ask.

 We have a bunch of WMware VM&#x27;s with BIOS firmware but goal is to get them to UEFI. We found that we can convert the disk using MBR2GPT.exe, but it brings an unexpected issue, the EFI partition is created at the end of the disk and the main partition is not extendable after that :(
 Also i could put MBR2GPT.exe to a MECM task sequence which boots into WinPE, converts the disk and shuts down, which is convenient.
 Has anyone faced a similar issue? How did you solve it? How to automate this as much as possible so that EFI partition is first on the disk?

                              <span>First job in sysadmin, we have a lot of clients, everyone is busy with their cases. each case I received requires tons of research and troubleshooting. This makes me miss sla’s and feedback with the clients because i find myself spending the day deep inside the clients env troubleshooting and chasing seniors and in meetings. I want to create a workflow to follow everyday just to know where my head is..

 Mail provider says we cannot store a smart host through which all outgoing e-mails should run, and you can only send via (mail provider).

When the caching server tries to fetch a file from the Azure Files shares you get an error on the client with &quot;Invalid file handle.&quot; as you can see in the following link: https://imgur.com/a/Ro4N1pX.
 Microsoft has confirmed that this has happened to several other customers as well.
 Keep you posted.

                              <span>I am tasked with securing UAC for our clients, based on recommendations from an audit.
 Can anyone tell me how &quot;User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation&quot; actually works?
 Enabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install are detected and the user is prompted for administrative credentials.
 Disabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install aren&#x27;t detected and the user isn&#x27;t prompted for administrative credentials.
 ​
 Microsoft says to set it to whatever fits my environment, CIS Benchmark says to enable it. But: Auditor actually recommends disabling it.
 So, which one is more secure? Does &quot;Disabled&quot; mean additional packages are simply not installed at all or does it install them without a UAC prompt?
 Thanks.

 I would like to know if any of you is actively working in France and hado to deal with what i wrote in the title.
 A friend of mine said he could not install an RMM software on his company computers, unless he update and present a document to the &quot;Economic and Social Committee&quot;.
 Thats new for me, and i would like to dig more on this matter, but i could not find any specific info.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for all the answers!

                              <span>Hi, Can anyone help me or give me an idea how to fix current problems with AppData Redirection?
 So heres the scenario: Our client has Active Directory, and we implemented Folder Redirection via GPO for all users (even AppData) and now it creates so many problems that i have no idea what to do. 
 For example: User is logged out from apps whenever he logs on other computer. He logs with his domain user on one PC then logs off and then logs on the other computer. When he logs off and comes back to his main pc and logs onto it, he is logged out in every app he was logged in. Google Chrome doesn&#x27;t work properly, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even want to open.
 Do I remove AppData from Folder Redirection? Are there any other solutions that allow to load Users Profile on different computers? Maybe Folder Redirection should be completely removed?
 If i missed something that you need to help me, tell me in the comments, English isn&#x27;t my first language so sorry about that.

                              <span>I have two DC&#x27;s connected with:
  
Forest Trust;
 Two-Way;
 Forest-wide Authentication; 
 DNS have each other zones as secondary
 Both domains at forest function level 2008. 
 Domain A has one master DC and when Global catalog redundant, both in windows 2016
 Domain B has one single DC on Windows 2008.
 
  
From Domain A to Domain B all is super. I can assign permissions to either network shares or remote desktop service access at will on both domains.
 Now from Domain B to Domain A, If a network share is within a Domain A machine, all is super again. I can assign permissions to both domain users.
 Now here comes trouble:
  
if the network share is on a Domain B device, i can list domain A just fine, but when i&#x27;m about to assign a permission i get the error that the domain controller can&#x27;t be found (but wait a minute you just gave me the complete list of users a moment ago?!);
 If i need to assign remote desktop permission to a domain B machine, again i can list all the users on domain A just fine, but when i&#x27;m about to commit the assign to a domain A user, again the error that DC couldn&#x27;t be reached.
  
I have recreated trust countless times, i have deleted and reassigned DNS zones both as secondaries and as Conditional Forwarders, to no avail any help?
 EDIT: &quot;The Active Directory Domain Controllers required to find the selected objects in the following domains are not avaiable: Domain A. Ensure the Active Directory Domain Controllers are avaiable, and try to select the objects again&quot; 
 Hello?! Who gave the list that i picked a specific user in the previous screen? c&#x27;mon man...

 My current occupation right now &quot;IT Implementer&quot; for a branch of multinational animal feed manufacturing company (that is our main product, although our product lineup are diverse, from animal feed, poultry breeding &amp; abattoir, dairy products and FMGC).

But as I joined the company three years ago, my responsibility has swelled up a lot.

                              <span>We have a machine that keeps upgrading to Windows 11, despite putting the registry keys in place to keep it on Windows 10. Last week I moved it back to 10, then cleared the update catalog and rebooted multiple times, even running manual updates and it didn&#x27;t update. The machine was then turned on at the weekend and has updated to Windows 11 for the 3rd time.
 Their server is 2012R2 so we&#x27;re trying to keep the machines on Windows 10 until the new one is installed, does anyone have other methods of blocking the updates? I have been informed that installing the ADMX to try the group policy method just caused other issues with the server, which is why I went down the registry route.

                              <span>edit colleague mentioned he has also seen it on his infrastructure using windows 10 LTSC 1809 so apparently it&#x27;s not specific to servers only
 I&#x27;ve seen this problem for quite some time and always ignored but I guess it&#x27;s time to figure out how to fix it. So I&#x27;m looking for any advice on how to proceed with fixing it once and for all.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve looked into:
  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload has correct number of keyboard layouts - the two I&#x27;ve set (00000409 and 00000419, English and russian) - as expected
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Keyboard Layout\Preload has English only (00000409) - as expected
 
In settings &gt; time and language &gt; language I only have two languages selected, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
powershell&#x27;s Get-WinUserLanguageList returns two languages, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
 And yet, there are three keyboard layouts to select from in tray - being two I&#x27;ve selected and 1 extra called QAA, which is basically English.
 Logging out and back in again doesn&#x27;t fix it. Rebooting doesn&#x27;t fix it. The only way to fix it is to override current settings - either using powershell or manually resetting up all that. But problem appears again sooner or later - maybe next reboot or maybe 4 months in - appears to be random.
 Googling leads nowhere as all there either temporal fixes that I&#x27;ve mentioned or common useless advice like &quot;run sfc scannow&quot;
 Has anyone figured out how to get rid of that problem permanently?

                              <span>Help my sanity... I&#x27;m not a Dell guy.
 Is there a way to remotely force a physical drive into down state on a Dell SCv3020 array?
 One disk in the array has very high (&gt;300ms) latency and filling the log with &quot;[Aborted]&quot; messages but for whatever reason the array controller hasn&#x27;t taken the disk out of the RAID. The high latency on one disk is breaking everything connected to the array.
 I can only find &quot;Release Disk&quot; in Storage Manager but that is trying to rebalance the RAID by moving the data away from the failing disk which will take a very long time.
 I&#x27;d like to force the disk into failed state without rebalancing. I know I could pull the disk, but I&#x27;m trying to avoid a long car journey.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am trying to troubleshoot an issue for a customer where our screen sharing solution requires port 7100 to be open in order for it to work correctly however, with this particular customer we&#x27;ve found that their managed devices are not working. We can bring in unmanaged devices on their network and our software works fine but it&#x27;s only when we try and connect using their managed devices do we get blocked. 
 We&#x27;ve disabled their Sophos AV, apparently they&#x27;ve had a look at their inbound/outbound ports on Windows Defender and can&#x27;t see any blocks on 7100 so my question is - how else can we find out what&#x27;s blocking this port? Any scanning tools that will point us to some kind of GPO or other application block?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m unable to setup the Process Explorer to run at startup via Task Scheduler. Regardless if I create the task via the Process Explorer menu &#x27;Run at startup&#x27; or manually I am unable to make it work.
 I&#x27;ve installed Systeinternals via winget: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
winget list sysinternals
 Name Id Version Source
 Sysinternals Suite 9P7KNL5RWT25 2022.10.1.0 msstore &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
Running the task does nothing and there are no errors in the task history log. It is as if nothing happens. &#x27;Run with highest privileges&#x27; also does nothing What I find very odd about the installation is that procexp.exe is a 0kb file in the Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps folder. It has no icon but I can run it normally by double-clicking on it. However if I use Task Scheduler and I try to selected it (via Browser on Actions) I get the following error:  procexp.exe The file cannot be accessed by the system. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>we&#x27;ve recently started to move our default deployed image to win11. We&#x27;ve since noticed that activation is behaving weird and so far i cannot get to the bottom of whats going on.
 We deploy our image via ConfMgr. Enterprise version is selected from the iso as a untouched image. All our changes are done via GPO or CM after the iso. Originally it did not have a key defined (overlooked/assumed AD KMS would take over), but thats now been corrected in the Task Sequence.
 I stumbled on the fact my laptop is one thats affected; it&#x27;s using the Pro retail key thats burnt into UEFI. ok - no problem; slmgr /upk, /ipk {GVLK}, /ato and /dli to confirm. /dli shows the expected KMS activation from AD. Great, job done i&#x27;ll get that pushed out to existing clients via a Task Sequence that runs those same commands. A week later i noticed my laptop is back to the pro licence (i reboot weekly; sleep the laptop during the week)
 redo the slmgr process, reboot and now the key has reverted back to the pro retail key again.
 has anyone seen this behaviour or know why it&#x27;s occuring?

                              <span>Friendly redditors and fellow sysadmins, I need to prevail upon your assistance on this fine Monday. 
 I am attempting to identify a specific planning tool that I have encountered in the past, but cannot for the life of me remember the name of. My Google foo seems to be pretty bad today as well.
 In summary, this is a tool published by a company (can’t remember the name) that allows you to pay an annual license fee to get access to part libraries from various vendors and then use these to build BOMs to submit to suppliers. I know it has libraries from Aruba, Cisco, Extreme, to name but a few. 
 Before anyone says it, I am not thinking about Visio or anything like that. This tool allows you to select e.g. an Aruba CX6300 switch and then can show you which addon modules are compatible with this switch and would then allow you build a complete BOM around this, including PSUs, SFP transceivers, interconnect cables, etc.
 Please, if anybody knows this tool, I am trying to identify it, as I need to submit budget approval for it.

 ​
 I need to use Microsoft Excel on a Windows Terminalserver for about 30 users.
 Currently, there is no Azure Active Directory in use (and not planned).
 ​
 Office 365 seems to be the easiest option, but I do not want every user to have to logon daily &quot;manually&quot;. --&gt; Is there any possibility without AAD to automate the logon?
 ​
 My alternative seems to be Excel as OpenValue with SA.
 ​
 Are you aware of any other option?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

                              <span>Hi There , 
 ​
 ​
 I have a scenario and couple questions 
 ​
 Here is the following configuration of the two organizations:
 ​
 Organization 1:
 ​
 Exchange 2013 CU23
 ​
 Organization 2:
 ​
 Exchange 2016 CU19 &amp; Hybrid 
 ​
 Both organizations have an internal connection between them and a Full Trust Relationship.
 ​
 ​
 I am very confused related to the Organization Relationships.
 ​
 I have found an article like below.
 ​
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/the-hybrid-mesh/ba-p/605910
 ​
 MS says:
 ​
  
Create an Organization Relationship between Contoso on-premises and Tailspin on-premises. Use a unique SMTP namespace for the domain name in the Organization Relationship like OnPrem.Tailspintoys.com
  
Note: In most environments, the shared namespace “TailspinToys.com” can be used as the Target address for on-premises users and you would not need the additional namespace of onprem.TailspinToys.com. However, to account for all complex partnerships that could be in place, a unique namespace used as the target address will ensure free busy works properly.
 ​
 Note: The domain name “TailspinToys.com” is not present in any of the Organization Relationships in the Contoso environment. Keeping this name out of the Organization Relationship will ensure that you can continue to use the shared namespace and see free/busy information.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Do I have to use unique address like OnPrem.companyb.com? Because We dont have any DNS record such as OnPrem.companyb.com. I want to use companyb.com as domain name for Organization Relationship between Company A on-premises and Company B on-premises. 
 ​

 First of all, English isn’t my first language, so sorry about any mistakes i make. We have an On-Premise Exchange 2016 running on a VM. I received two support tickets declaring crashes after importing company contacts into own contacts. Outlook then loses connection for about 10-15 Minutes. Can anyone help me with this?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 We are designing a network for our new medical center within the region. When designing a hierarchical network, we were having brainstorming discussion with internal engineering team to take a decide on using 3-tier network for Data Center and 2-Tier for Campus (endpoints and end devices)
 The center would occupy 2000+ endpoints in the network. We propose two main core switches, setup as VSS and aggregating approx. 70 access switches installed in different floors in the building communication rooms. Single stack contains 5 or 6 access switches with 10G uplinks to upstream core switches. Access are all L2, and we route between VLANs using SVIs on the core switches and some VLANs are firewalled for Guest and IoT devices.
 Pair of high specs firewalls connected to cores for perimeter (internet, wan &amp; dmz) and internal segmentation (servers &amp; end devices, depending on the use case and security controls requirements.
 Eventually, with regard to servers, we are thinking about having 3-tier network: access &gt; distribution &gt; main campus core
 Two distribution switches with Servers SVIs on them or Firewalls. 
 L2 links terminated on Cores with Point-to-Point transit VLAN. Servers connecting to TOR access switches. 
 Please share your thoughts and comments for 3-tier approach and feel free to add your invaluable inputs if anything is wrong in the design.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve recently discussed if we should keep greylisting enabled on our spam filters.
 I&#x27;ve been researching opinions about greylisting and it seems to have some mixed reactions. Some say it still useful while others say it just causes headaches with email delays and doesn&#x27;t help that much.
 What&#x27;s your take on it?

                              <span>We have several access switches and a single cores switch. We want to configure it as such access switches cannot connect to each other. 
 No stp will be configure in the core switch and bpdu will be disable using a multicast block that is coming thru the trunk port
 Each access switches will have their own stp domain and bpdu guard enable on all access port except thr uplink trunk port
 Will there be a loop seen in this configuration? We would like to limit the use of stp in our network.
 Any advise or comments will be appreciated

                              <span>Hey there. I&#x27;m very new to the field... just finished my CCNA not long ago. I&#x27;ve been hired on at a fortune 100 company as the trainee network engineer. Our network operates on a far greater scale than anything I&#x27;ve studied so I&#x27;m hoping someone can point me in the right direction for a resource I can read to help me get up to speed. 
 So long story short... At the CCNA level there is not much BGP required. As long as you know &quot;its the routing protocol of the internet&quot; your about good... Well anyways we have our core and 2 wan edge devices. These wan edge devices have tunnels to each of our some 300+ locations. Each location has a BGP AS number... all in the 65000 private range (at least as far as I understand it). 
 So I guess what I&#x27;m asking is does anyone have a resource I can read and study up on using BGP as a primary internal routing protocol? I have googled iBGP but man... the amount of info out there is nuts. It&#x27;s so much to the point I dont even know where to begin reading...
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am looking at replacing our access switches in our sites in a year and wanted to look at something not Cisco. 
 I&#x27;ve been team team for over a decade and can afford them but recently, I&#x27;ve seen more and more problems with them. I even had a bug that TAC said &quot;We will wait until someone reports this bug to see if code comes out to fix it&quot; when THEY discovered the bug with me while working on the case. I asked if THEY might be the right team to report said bug and they blew me off. I don&#x27;t need anything crazy -10G uplinks, 48-1G ports, stackable. Right now I&#x27;m running 9200 switches and was looking for recommendations. 
 I&#x27;m leaning toward HP/Aruba but need to dig into which model is closest to these 9200s and want to stay away from anything that handcuffs you with licensing (I.E. charges you to make a 1G port a 10G). Any recommendations? I&#x27;ll end up with about 350 spread out across all of my remote sites so I wanted to buy a few now and plug them in on an upcoming small project to get some time with them. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am moving from Unifi AP’s to HP Aruba’s. I am planning on rolling them out one at a time, and replacing as I have time.
 Generally speaking we have a business VLAN, and a guest VLAN. If I make the SSID and the passwords the same, and simply replace (since the ports are tagged right on the switches), does it matter? 
 I dont think it would, none of my Unifi stuff is mesh, so it should just jump to wherever its able, right?

                              <span>So I am extremely new to the networking industry. I&#x27;m in my first semester of college (computer technology) and just got a job as a network technician by dumb luck. One of my first tasks is to get an old managed HP 1910 switch up and running to be added to the network. I have a brand new USB to rj45 console cable. I&#x27;m using putty with serial connection enabled. Bits per second 38400. Data bits 8. Stop bits 1. With both parity and flow control set to none. Com 3 is the only serial line that pulls up a terminal. However the terminal is blank and after waiting 10+ mins multiple times and even power cycling during the terminal or before trying to connect, I am unable to get any text to appear on the terminal screen. Am I missing something? I&#x27;m feeling kinda dumb here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi!
 There is Cat6 cabling between my MDF and IDF. It&#x27;s OK for now but an opportunity presented itself to have fiber run between them at almost no extra cost as part of another project. I don&#x27;t have any equipment right now that would be using it so it would be kind of future proofing and would be nice to have an option of 10Gig as I can easily see that being asked for in the future. Now, having never used fiber before I&#x27;m not sure what fiber should be run? I was asked if I want single- or multi-mode. What should I choose? I traditionally stick with Cisco switches, in case this is important and the distance between the locations is at most 200 ft. Are there any other questions that I should ask at this time or when I&#x27;m ready to use that link?

                              <span>I know using them is frowned upon but I am curious. 
 Does MAC address whitelisting (I one this is also not good, but 802.1x is not on the table for a while) configured on firewall still work for devices that connect to unmanaged switch, like desktop connected to netgear 8 port desk switch over Ethernet?
 My company can’t afford wiring new lines right now and we have some machines that can’t use Wi-Fi, they must be plugged in. The topic of unmanaged switches came up. 
 If I can at least whitelist devices on the firewall to allow/deny computers that plug into the unmanaged switch it would be ok for a little bit.
 Would love to hear what everyone thinks about it!

                              <span>I am fairly new to IPV6 (and networking in general).
 Have a PC that needs to talk to a device over IPV6. Hooked the PC to the device using ethernet and attempted to set a static IPv6 address. 
 Device has a static IP of fe80::def set up by manufacturer. Don&#x27;t have an option to change this. Attempted to set static IP on computer to fe80:abc, prefix to 64, and default gateway to fe80::1.
 Whenever I leave the ethernet properties page the static IP reverts to automatic IPV6 address rather than static. Any idea what I am missing?

                              <span>I installed our current “core” switch, a HP 5412zl, exactly 10 years ago. Small network for a SMB ($55m/yr in revenue). 24/7 casino/hotel, so downtime would hurt but ownership understands shit happens.
 Have 12 other ProCurve edge switches connecting to it with 2 or 3 1GbE trunks. It does my VLAN routing. All copper currently, might add fiber in a few years when we expand. Kept it simple. IP cameras are the top bandwidth devices. 
 I updated the firmware 400 days ago, which was the last reboot. I have a spare eBay 5412zl on a shelf for parts. 
 How much risk is involved with running a 10+ core switch? Am I crazy to run this another 5 years before replacing it? Do you see switches fail after 10+ years frequently?

I have a weird space constraint in a certain spot and I need to route an ethernet connection to two devices and the cleanest solution would probably be something that plugs in like that. 100 Mbit switch is perfectly acceptable. No need to gigabit.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m designing an EVPN-BGP network. I have never gone into etails wrt BGP.I read Krattiger&#x27;s book about EVPN-BGP a Nexus 9000&#x27;s perspective and there he always mentions that two fashions of eBGP might be used:
  
one AS for the spines, one for all the leaves; here the ption of accepting prefixes from own&#x27;s AS must be cnfigured, otherwise all the announcements will be discarded
 one AS for the spines and one AS for each VTEP; here I only see a bit of complexity in configuring each VTEP because I cannot apply the same settings.
  
eBGP was proposed because, I think, if a peer goes down, then all the family memebers announce by it will be witdrawn in the peer&#x27;s BGP table.
 Then somebody proposed to use
 3) iBGP but with Route Reflectors, because when a VTEP goes down all the family members announced by it will be withdrawn by the BGP tables of of al lthe clients.
 What do you implement in your own EVPN-BGP design and why?Any preferences among the 3 options above?
 TIA, Pan

                              <span>The idea is simple: We need dynamic allocation of an incoming request via https, which will use a domain, e.g subdomain1.domain.org, which needs to be mapped to internal IP X.X.X.X and Port Y. Then, subdomain2.domain.org needs to go on a different port and IP. 
 Nothing special so far.
 ​
 Dynamic meaning on the fly, without having to edit a config file. These mapping need to be editable by another program.
 ​
 The subdomains can be created at will and need to be routed to the correct instance of our program (where each instance runs on a different port).
 There is nothing special needed, just a simple domain -&gt; IP:PORT mapping like HAProxy can do.
 However, HAProxy has its Runtime API, which seems to not be able to hold up to this task.
 ​
 Do I need to create a custom forwarding solution, or are there existing ones which i could use?
 I personally think that HAProxy is really made for this, but it does not feature a way for dyamic creation. Since adding needs to be done ASAP, these edits cannot be done by hand and have to happen automatically.
 ​
 Has anyone here experience regarding automatic proxying? It seems like NGINX has some kind of feature like this, but then i&#x27;d had to pay a few thousands bucks for their NGINX plus model.
 ​
 Please let me know if more clarification is needed.

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with helping build out a core network for our company. We recently merged with several other “local” businesses and are looking to build out a core network between the sites. Our CIO has already indicated his desire that the core will be a DWDM fiber ring but has left the rest to me (with assistance from some of our consultants).
 I’m curious if anyone has any insights that they learned from doing something similar. Anything you wished you incorporated into the design? Any vendor preferences or experience? We are currently looking at Ciena and Adva for DWDM and Cisco and Extreme for Core Routing. And I’d like to have the same vendor supply both core routing and Data Center switches. Corporate Network itself will be Cisco for the foreseeable future.
 Size wise (for context) Site is Core Chassis, 24 IDFs (30 9400 chassis) and ~400 Access Switches. ~65-70000 endpoints according to ISE. The other three sites are about 1/3-1/2 that size

                              <span>I am responsible for a community building in my village where we want to improve the network. The budget is limited of course.
 I want to have an internal LAN, for internal equipment, which can also be accessible through WiFi. I also want to create a public LAN for guests, wireless as well as wired (from selected places). The private lan should not be reachable from the public lan, but the opposite is ok.
 We managed to lay our hands on a Cisco WLC plus 5 APs as well as two Cisco manageable switches, so I believe that the only thing missing here is a router (preferably Cisco). Can anyone please suggest a suitable model? It needs to be able to handle Gigabit Ethernet, otherwise I don’t believe it needs any fancy features 
 I have found a used Cisco ISR 4331 for about $250 which is within my budget. Would this be a good choice?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Did img backup using macrium of windows 10 ssd 240gb (full) to my external 2tb hdd, how do I boot into a vm from my external hdd since the internal ssd is full? It wouldn&#x27;t let me as the img backup and the initial boot (loading the macrium iso) of the vm can&#x27;t both be from the external hdd apparently? Just want to test and see if the backup works/is stable. Thanks all.
 ​
 EDIT: More info. I set the vm file location to the external hdd and when I tried to enable the physical usb external hdd to connect to the vm to load the disk img backup, an error popped up basically saying I can&#x27;t do those 2 things from an external drive?? It wouldn&#x27;t let me boot and recover the backup since if I enabled the physical external hdd to the vm to access the img backup, it would disable the external hdd to the main pc which is what the vm is running from. 
 Is there a way for the external hdd to work in the vm and with the main pc at the same time?
 ​
 Have I just missed something obvious? I am confused lol. 
 ​
 I must&#x27;ve done something wrong. Most people can&#x27;t just boot up their backup on the internal drive because who has enough space for that? (Essentially 2 copies of a whole computer on the same drive) Mine is only 240gb, how do guys with maxed 3tb drives test their backups? Nobody just assumes their giant backup works?

                              <span>We currently use USB’s to image new computers. I’d like to find a faster method and was wondering if anyone had any guides to do this?
 We have 10+ offices and each has their own localized server, so they’re not all interconnected or anything. Have only been at this company for about a year fresh out of college, I’m currently the only IT on premises with msp backup support. 
 Thanks guys!

                              <span>So during the weekend we tried a « p2v » conversion from an azure VM to vmware 7.0u3 host
 We used the vmware converter latest version and the conversion went fine. Windows booted (2008r2) lol and everything worked, except the SSL certificate. Who was broken
 We even tried to reimported the SSL certificate and it seems that the whole ssl certificate IIS store stemmed broken
 So we tried to download the VHD from azure and convert them to VMDK and import them into vmware and all worked #1
 Is it something that vmware converter couldn’t do or is it something on the azure side?
 I’m kinda lost
 Thanks

                              <span>I work at a university, and most staff that have IT issues seem to think they already know the answer, or just have general &quot;hmm I still think IT is at fault&quot; demeanour when you&#x27;re giving an answer to their problem.
 I generally try to be really civil, but sometimes the answer to an issue is so glaringly obvious, and becomes a real waste of time have to go through all the rigmarole to prove that the problem is a user problem, not a system/network/IT problem, that I feel I need to be a bit more blunt and not worry too much about how I&#x27;m coming across.
 To give you an example, just recently I had person in senior management raise a ticket because an important document couldn&#x27;t be found on SharePoint. The ticket was escalated to me, and after looking into it, it just looks like someone moved the doc into another folder (probably accidentally). The user was trying to access the file from a URL link, and when it didn&#x27;t work (because the file was moved), they panicked and assumed IT had done something. When I told the user that the file was most likely moved, their response is still implying that IT had something to do with it, as no one in their team (over 10 people, all with edit access to the file) would have moved the file. I reiterated that it was probably an accident by someone in the team, and a fairly common and easily addressable mistake, but the user has now involved their manager, to make sure the problem doesn&#x27;t happen again. It&#x27;s now become a way bigger issue than it ever needed to be, all because someone just accidentally moved an important file, and the user just can&#x27;t accept that this happened and it wasn&#x27;t someone IT behind it.
 This is just a recent scenario. Issues like these seem to happen all the time, where frustrated users just don&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;re telling them and seem to just blame anything on either IT staff or systems that they don&#x27;t understand, yet speak with authority on.
 Any advice?

 Still get number out of 9.9 and such, is it to get you to look at critical items more or something else going on?

                              <span>The company I&#x27;m working for has historically bought whatever random computers were needed as people were hired from wherever they could get them. This was ok at first but we&#x27;ve grown and need to start operating more like a real IT department.
 I&#x27;d like to hear what laptop you have and how it differs from what your users have, or if you have multiple tiers.
 The market really is Dell, HP and Lenovo. I&#x27;m not really interested in HP.
 They say IT should have what the users have. We&#x27;re a bit tricky since we have a ton of tech employees and engineers.
 A lot of people are running docker on their laptops but do not need absolutely absurd power but this just means the low end is out.
 I think we can cross off anything extremely low end, but also 9 pound workstation devices.

                              <span>I work in a manufacturing environment. Many things are done “because this is how we’ve always done it”. Change can prove to be difficult, but the toner headaches alone are enough for me to want to prompt change. Right now hundreds of pieces of paper are printed per shift and filled out by hand. One poor lady has to scan all these into a folder then they are just recycled. My thought is a few Windows based domain joined tablets with a shared account. That way all production paperwork can be filled out on the tablet and saved to the network location. 
 I have explained this and am still getting some push back. Any other suggestions?

 Trying to configure a Brother printer via print management. I have reset the printer, disabled firewall and applied all other troubleshooting that I read up here and other places. I can log into the printer web page and ping it as well. The issue has occurred recently after some updates- maybe windows 10?, I can&#x27;t be sure.

                              <span>So... we have our topology and sites well-defined and based on physical location of data centers with DCs in them. What we haven&#x27;t been keeping up with is the subnet definitions. We now have hundreds to add.
 My question is: is it better try try to supernet and add large ranges of IP, and maybe misalign some ranges, or to add all of the smaller ranges and ensure we have the right sites associated with each subnet?
 There is a business case for the smaller subnets, but I&#x27;m not sure if it creates issues with lag on site lookup.

                              <span>This is the fourth job in 7 years I&#x27;m getting laid off due to mergers or outsourcing and it&#x27;s getting tiring. I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, right here when age discrimination starts becoming a real thing, and just want a stable company for the next 15 years. 
 So the good news is the company is giving us 10 months severance plus 1 week&#x27;s pay for every year and 6 months of insurance after we are let go.
 The bad news. When our director called us into the conference call to give the news he was very candid and probably told us more than he should have. Basically, it boils down to money, the business leaders found they can hire in Europe/UK for 60% of US wages. They can hire Indians for 20% of US wages. Australian wages were a wash with the US. They also decided it&#x27;s cheaper to move the HQ to Ireland (with much lower corporate taxes) and import to the US. 
 I work with folks from Ireland and UK every day and their work is every bit as good as what we do in the states. I&#x27;m not bashing their skills but more concerned if we, Americans with insane salaries, have priced ourselves out of the global market. The state I live in has an average income of $61k. I make $153k. I make this kind of money with no degrees, a couple of entry-level certs, and to be honest very little effort on my part. I just kind of have been the guy people get along with and every few years some past co-worker DMs me if I&#x27;m interested in a new job. 
 Add in the sharp rise in remote work capabilities it&#x27;s easier than ever for companies to look abroad for workers. Hell, even Canada and Mexico have much cheaper labor.

                              <span>I have an old OS DC and I would like to upgrade it to WIN2022, I&#x27;ve created 2 new DC&#x27;S that supposed to replace the old one.
 Once I try to demote the old DC, the wizard tells me that it is the last DC in the network, which means it doesn&#x27;t recognize the 2 new DC I&#x27;ve created.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a trained sysadmin, more of a guy who got roped into doing some IT stuff.
 So I have 15 Surface Go with Windows 10 with S mode. I need to make all of them have Windows 10 Home(via the free switch using Microsoft Store) with the same set of software. I figured the easiest way to do this is to clone a &quot;master&quot; Surface Go and clone them to the other 14 machines using Clonezilla.
 I am wondering if the master Surface Go&#x27;s license key will get cloned to the other machines or if their key is already burnt into bios and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them. Or do I have to find the keys for each machine and &quot;re-key&quot; them after cloning? 
 As of now, I don&#x27;t have a budget to get VLs or Enterprise licensing but if that is the only way to do it properly I&#x27;ll have to do some convincing to my bosses...

                              <span>I have 6 DCs. Some running 2016 and 1 on 2012r2. I need to bring the functional level to 2016 on 2019 servers. I must re use the IPs and i prefer to keep the server names if we can.
 I understand in place upgrade on DC is not recommended. Would it be ok to demote, in place upgrade, promote? (of course, health check, migrate FSMO etc).
 I guess the next best option is deploy new VM, demote the old server and change IP of new server, then promote. But i lose the name and for matters of convenience, i&#x27;d rather not. Could i safely use the first option?

It happened to totally randomly and I have no idea what it&#x27;s talking about. Even if I knew the code that it wants, it won&#x27;t allow me to type anything in the space provided. Underneath this is an option to change languages which I am able to click so the entire screen is not Frozen it&#x27;s just it won&#x27;t let me get the cursor going....
 Is there something I can do like a key I can press upon starting up to bypass this requirement? Please help there is so so much valuable information on this laptop. 
 Thank you!!!!

                              <span>So its been about a year since I have been with this public community college. 
 One of the things they do here is when an employee retires they get to keep there email address. 
 I personally feel that that&#x27;s not a good thing. I did some PowerShell here and there and basically did this. 
 1) Who are all the retired employees?
 2) When was the last time they have logged in to there exchange 2016 or Online. 
 Nearly all have not logged in within a year or more. 
 ​
 My concerns are that;
 1) They don&#x27;t have MFA enabled. 
 2) They may contain sensitive information in those emails. So if the email becomes compromised that becomes accessible information. 
 3) If the account becomes compromised, they can use that email to communicate to other employees and make it easier to social engineer them. 
 4) A wasted license. 
 I am still new to my role and I may be paranoid for nothing, so from a more experienced individual what are your thoughts on this and if its best to get rid of this plan what are the reasons? 
 I have some directors that agree with me, but my VP of technology doesn&#x27;t (Ironic I think). 
 ​
 But of course if a user isn&#x27;t trying to log into there account would it really get compromised? I don&#x27;t know, but I appreciate every input! Thanks.

                              <span>At one point, I had an OpenLDAP server running in my homelab on a Raspberry Pi as I was trying to learn OpenLDAP setup and configuration. I had it working and could even use it to authenticate 802.1x connection attempts.
 Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I&#x27;m trying to recreate it from scratch and I&#x27;m having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I&#x27;ve managed to set the &#x27;admin&#x27; password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using &#x27;cn&#x3D;admin,cn&#x3D;config&#x27;, but that&#x27;s about it. I can&#x27;t change, create, or delete anything.
 I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don&#x27;t remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can&#x27;t even do that as the admin user itself is RO.
 What&#x27;s even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I&#x27;ve been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can&#x27;t write anything except its own password apparently.
 How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? 
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>We recently onboarded a group of test engineers that are constantly running automated tests 24/7 (all conducted on their own VLAN network). Ever since they’ve joined everyone has started complaining about slow internet and we cannot upgrade our main ISP connection since we’re already on the highest (albeit slow in general) service tier. 
 Luckily a new ISP became available and we are about to sign up with them. 
 So I had a question about how to best configure my firewall appliance now that I’ll have two ISPs. 
 What are the pros/cons of these ideas:
  
Load balance WAN1 and WAN2. 
 
Get the testers on a dedicated switch that would connect to a dedicated interface port on the firewall and route that traffic to WAN2. 
 
 Which of these two would be the better option? If there are any better ideas let me know.

 Both are directly connected to each other and are also in OSPF 
 Router A loopback and router ID 1.1.1.1
 Router B loopback and Router ID 1.1.1.2
 Router A and Router B direct link 192.1681.1. and 192.168.1.2 respectively
 QUESTIONS
  
When I ping Router B from A without sourcing, what is the source address of the ping? default source address 
  
2.When I ping Router B from A sourcing from 192.168.1.1 (interface Ip) , is the loopback of Router A involved somehow in the ping ?

                              <span>Hello wizards of /r/networking,
 I am looking for a sanity check and guidance on how to proceed. I started at a new firm almost a year ago and the environment feels like I went back in time twenty years. There are three members of the team: the senior guy, my boss and me. Basically the situation is: I am trying to propose modern ways to design the network and the senior guy isn&#x27;t having any of it. Here&#x27;s an example:
 In the current topology, the senior guy has configured one firewall interface per VLAN. When they ran out of interfaces on the firewall, the previous person in my position configured an 802.1q trunk for three VLANs, to which the senior guy objected to, but it was done anyway because obviously, there weren&#x27;t any firewall interfaces left. The senior guy was also adamant about ke…</span>

                              <span>I’m looking for some career advice in regard to moving into a network automation role. I am a network engineer with just over 10 years of experience. I am the one on my team tasked with automating. However, automation isn’t my primary job. I have an associates degree and some Cisco certs (including DEVNETASC). I’ve created web apps, automated network configuration, and created scheduled scripts to automate repeatable tasks. I have seen job postings for “Network Development Engineer” roles at large companies like Amazon and was wondering if anyone here is in a similar role and can give me advice on what hiring managers are looking for. Do I need a computer science degree? I actually just started a journey to get a CS degree, but man is it time consuming(especially with a family), expensive, and a lot of math (four more math classes). Or would my time be better spent getting DEVNET Professional and maybe some cloud certs?

                              <span>So the question I have relates to Cisco Jabber. The User (or Users) can make calls from Jabber going from Jabber on his laptop to External company numbers. However they are not able to contact Internal company numbers.
 Naturally someone said it sounds like a routing issue. (Most of the company has Jabber working this is a new group being stood up working from vpns)
 User(who is on a vpn) can ping all the way into the Datacenter to the call manager server, I can ping from the switch the server is connected to, to the User PC. I can ping both directions from the Data Center Backbone switch. Routing seems to work. 
 ​
 So here&#x27;s my thoughts. If they are able to talk to external numbers then the traffic has to go all the way into the datacenter anyways and hit the server before going back out again. Also from what I saw in emails of previous troubleshooting the Jabber Client on the PC is saying connected as far as registering with the server goes.
 (also for your knowledge I&#x27;m mainly from networking side of the house, we have a separate dept for the phone stuff so typically don&#x27;t get too much into phone issues most of the time.)
 ​
 Jabber Outgoing - &gt; External Number - Works
 Jabber Incoming Internal Number - Not Work
 Jabber Incoming -&gt; Internal Number - Not Work
 ​
 Any thoughts of what more to look into or questions I should ask?

 The thing is that the students are using O365 for their email and authentication but it does not appear that they have an Azure DC service. Faculty is using a hybrid prem/azure deployment with Clear pass access rules to provide services to the Faculty wireless network. 
 I am familiar with opening services up on a Meraki Wireless and clearpass is a new animal for me. If someone can point me to a doc or tutorial on opening up a domain/server to these guys i would appreciate it. My googlefu is weak.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been diddling around with influencing routes using BGP attributes in a multihomed environment with 2 network edge routers who both have connections to both ISP routers. 
 I looked in the OCG ENCOR book and it doesn&#x27;t mention anything about how NAT would work in an environment like this. I imagine there&#x27;s some way that 2 routers could share NAT translations but my Google skills are failing me. 
 What&#x27;s considered best practice in a network like this?

                              <span>Hey guys i am running into a problem. I recently switched careers from corporate to to a .edu. All edu domains are provided by educause as they are the sole registrar. Unfortunately they don’t provide DNS host. 
 I tried cloudflare but my director has a dislike for their services as we need like 38 cname and MX entries.
 So my question is this who else offer an affordable DNS Hosting that can support the number of records we are pointing to our various services and sub domains.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I have the following network (currently in eve-ng):
 Left Switch: Vlan 10 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 10 computer
 (Connecting both Switches I have a trunk port configured in both Switches) 
 Right Switch: Vlan 30 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Router configured with subinterfaces for each Vlan (10,20,30), when &quot;show ip route&quot; shows everything allright
 So my problem is that I have configured everything exactly the same for each Vlan to make Router-On-A-Stick possible and it works, for example I can ping Vlan 30 computer to Vlan 20 computer or the opposite case but no computer on any Vlan can ping Vlan 10 and Vlan 10 can&#x27;t ping the other Vlans. So what could be the problem? I swear to God I configured every Vlan in the same way and I have deleted the lab and started again several times and happens the same issue. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Why are there different types of them when they are basically just doing the same thing, just sending data? I understand perhaps there&#x27;s something different with the formatting of different data such as files or videos but on a digital level they&#x27;re just a bunch of ones and zeros so why bother making different types?
 ​
 Also, I&#x27;ve tried cutting an ethernet cable in half and I can&#x27;t seem to find any additional circuitry. All I saw was just a bunch of wires together. So what makes this ethernet cable different from a USB cable? Is there a circuit inside that I didn&#x27;t see that processes or sends data differently?
 ​
 Also read that HDMI is better designed for sending media such as video, but why so? why is it better than a USB? Does it have some additional circuitry? If yes, what does it do?

                              <span>Hey everyone. Just looking for some advice. I work in a public hospital system with 8500+ employees. Myself and one other person are responsible for Mobile Technology in all forms: Vocera, Encrypted Flash drives/Ironkey, iPads/iPhones and MDM (Intune), the corporate cellular account, and BYOD support. 
 We&#x27;ve basically been slammed since COVID happened. We work 50 hours a week, then get paged off hours because we didn&#x27;t get to that one ticket that is now suddenly &quot;patient impacting&quot;. Despite working without a lunch break, being in many meetings for projects (6-10hrs a week), and working my ticket queue when possible, we never catch up. For the past two years, we&#x27;ve never been under 100 requests, and we&#x27;ve been building two new sites that have many different mobile applications in which I&#x27;ll somehow be supporting. As of current, my team of two support over 17k devices including 5k personal devices in BYOD. 
 I know nowhere is perfect, but I feel my boss is being arrogant when I ask him about hiring more people. His response is always &quot;this is only a phase&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re fully staffed at what we have, we&#x27;ll have to get caught up&quot;. But other internal IT depts are hiring like crazy. The apps team hired 5 in the last two years and the epic team brought in a whole company of 20 contractors to do their breakfix while they worked on our new sites. Just as examples
 I guess what I&#x27;m asking is is this situation everywhere? Am I dreaming that IT life doesn&#x27;t have to be so understaffed and overworked? I&#x27;m salary and don&#x27;t break 75k, and my coworker is at 55k. We get great healthcare, which is why I stay, but just wondering if you all think I should man up and realize I work in a stressful environment and IT is that way everywhere, or is there better out there somewhere? What&#x27;s it like for you all in similar roles? Thanks for your thoughts!

                              <span>I had heard about the MS internal Azure blob that was not secured properly. I finally looked at the search that SOCRadar put up. 
 https://socradar.io/labs/bluebleed
 They do not return results, just whether the domain shows in the leak. My company’s does. 
 I’ve heard nothing from MS. I also suspect there is nothing sensitive I’ve given MS.
 I’m curious if anyone has been informed by MS that they were affected. 
 MS’ statement says, in part, “ Our investigation found no indication customer accounts or systems were compromised. We have directly notified the affected customers.”
 I’m also curious how they define “affected customers.”

 I am hoping that the collective minds here on Reddit can help me out. 
 I am the administrator of an air gapped network inside of our Enterprise-Wide Network 
 In order to access it the users must be on the EWN. 
 The network has its own domain which does not trust the EWN. 
 There is no smtp traffic allowed out. 
 The only way the end users can get it is to have an account on in my domain, as well as on the Enterprise domain. They can access 1 server over RDP.
 Now my problem is this, the accounts are set to expire every 30 days for security purposes. BUT there is no way the user can log in via RDP if their account is expired, to reset the account. 
 I am looking for a method for the users can manage their own accounts, so they don’t have to call me to reset their passwords. Are any of you in the same situation, and how do you resolve it?

                              <span>Greetings fellow IT professionals. I need your help and advise regarding PSU configuration issues in a Dell Poweredge r6515. It is running RHEL 8. I hope I can explain this clearly…
 We recently upgraded PSU’s in the server from 550w to 700w. According to the Dell website, the new PSU you install will take on the firmware of the previously installed PSU. So, in this case our 700w PSU is using the firmware of the 550w PSU. Obviously we just need to install the firmware for the 700w PSU’s. Here’s the catch, Dell doesn’t have any firmware for 700w PSU’s for this server available to download. There should be firmware available for download because you can buy the r6515 server from Dell with the 700w PSU’s installed. 
 When we boot up the server it enters the bios and gives a low power warning. 
 IDRAC says the input wattage is 666 and output wattage - rated: 700, actual: 550. 
 We have been talking back and forth with Dell tech support and their tier 1 support has no clue what’s going on. They sent technicians out this week to install a new power board but that didn’t do anything to help. The technicians got one of the Dell tier 2 support guys in the phone but he didn’t help much either. 
 Anyone have any ideas or have any experience with this situation?

It can often be blurry, depending on organization and its scale. What do you like? What do you work with? What would you like to see in a new job?
 First, the style:
 The best documentation I have ever read, was like reading an engaging story of growth, challenges and solutions. I felt like I have learned so much after finishing it.
 But it was a story of one custom application, not some giant system. Can it scale? Would it still be useful for later use if it was a large document?
 Some people know what will be useful, but not always you will catch everything.
 But are SOPs and RACIs the answer? 
 Second, the organization:

 Basically, something like a jason file that creates a desired server according to my specification quickly, without manually installing pieces, copy pasting configs, setting up user accounts, etc. I then simply keep track of this config file. 
 What software does that? Should I learn ansible? 
 This is just for personal use, not enterprise.

 These were purchased back before Brocade was acquired by Broadcom. I reached out to my Dell rep and apparently Dell now has their own Connectrix FC switches. I think these are still Brocades under the Dell badge.
 Anyone have any experience with them?

 The device I tested on has a TPM and I see no issuing errors on the server side So, it should be stored in the TPM. 
 I see no reference to the certificate in the user certificate MMC.
 Where can you view and verify that the certificate is being stored in the device Tpm?

 Then they installed a new production line using Siemens&#x27; products. Which none of the engineers or technicians had any training for.

 &quot;It&#x27;s fine, the vendor said they&#x27;ll program the production line for us.&quot;
 On the day that the production line was suppose to start, we quickly discovered there were de-synchronization between the stations that made up each stage of the production line. Such as one station being unable to properly tell an upstream station to send parts down the conv…</span>

new place (4-5 admins) and totally new mgmt
 lots of attrition and those that managed IT ( ran the shop from day to day) and knew how things work around here left.
 there is a leaver every 2 weeks( infra/apps/IT mgmt/business)
 average tenure is 3-6 mths 
 some cowboys ( 1-2 senior admins with medium to high skill / age in IT but only worked at the place for 12 mths maybe 24) who play guessing games and have to discover the env as they go ( no up to date /accurate documentation ) fix stuff which break without telling the rest exactly how and also don’t document or share their knowledge 
 stuff keeps breaking - cowboys on leave or not available leaving juniors or newbies 
 Majority of Apps team and senior mgmt is very new too and clueless and just trying to outsource to solve the issues
 lots of politics /pushback between teams ( especially apps/infra/security )and finger pointing 
 only good thing is deep/wide /complex tech stack and playground as admins have full access to a whole stack.
  
Any comments / strategies for noob in a minefield?

                              <span>Recently acquired a decommissioned Poweredge T420 that appears to be in okay condition, other than a missing RAID controller. 
 However, I&#x27;m also having issues at boot with iDRAC. Very similar to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cw7esz/idrac_initialization_error_on_poweredge_t420/ where fans are blowing at max speeds, the light at the back of the machine is flashing orange with the following error message:
  
Warning! iDRAC initialization error. Continuing to boot may yield unexpected power loss due to unknown power inventory and various features lost such as Remote Access, Active Power Management, Thermal Management, Inventory, LCD, or System Error Reporting. 
  
I guess my question is, do I have two separate issues going on here? Or is the iDRAC issue related to the missing raid controller. Just wondering if I purchase a replacement RAID controller am I going to still be stuck with more problems. This is my first Dell Server and have no experience with how iDRAC works.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am for a while in the business but never hat the opportunity to do a deep dive into packaging. Either no SCCM/intune client management was availabale or there was a dedicated resource taking care of it.
 I am good with powershell and found now some time. I want to do a deep dive ito packaging with psappdeloyment toolkit, since this seems becoming more important. 
 Can somebody guide me/recommend any good resources to get started? 
 Aiming for psapp packaging for intune to deploy to clients and virtual desktop infrastructure. 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Question for my fellow Windows Server Admins. I&#x27;ve got a client that has a Windows Server 2016. It&#x27;s running as a DC, a file server, and there&#x27;s an Access database that clients access through some program installed on the workstations. There&#x27;re two client workstations that can&#x27;t have the program installed and so have to access the database directly on the server. Their previous IT set up RDS but never installed licenses; they just kept renewing the trial. We&#x27;ve had to fix a lot of how the previous IT did things and we are trying to get licensing for the two workstations that need to RDP into the server to access the database. I believe you can have the RDS session host and the RDS licensing manager on the same box, but correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. Can I use 2022 Server CALs for this situation or do I have to use Server 2016 CALs?

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I&#x27;m looking for recommendations of and experiences with Linux antivirus options for on-premise company servers. We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn&#x27;t play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.
 We&#x27;re looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we&#x27;d only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).
 The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all &quot;Contact us!&quot;), thus I turn to you.

                              <span>So, I am finishing my course for becoming a sysadmin and I feel like I am varely scrapping the surface of what a sysadmin needs to know. 
 We&#x27;ve just learn a little bit of networking, some AD and LDAP management, server installation and configuration (DHCP, DNS, SMTP,...), some security (iptables, network traffic analysis) amongst other subjects that I feel have little to do with beeing a sysadmin.
 What would be the skills I should focus on learning first? What are the musts? What do you do more often in your job while beeing a sysadmin?
 Thanks in advance for your replies.

 At the moment we’ve through of a workbench area for testing, 1/2 screens for network monitoring, our own fridge and coffee station, and thats it! I wanted to see if you all had any ideas that would be useful. Were a small department so were not building for 100, more so for 5-8.
 Thanks!

                              <span>This includes SQL servers, DCs, IIS web servers, CAs, DHCP servers, a MECM/SCCM server, and quite a number of oddballs. What&#x27;s the worst you&#x27;ve run into when doing migrations/upgrades like this? And more importantly, could the issue you had, have been avoided?
 Honesty appreciated, I have never performed upgrades on this scale, I&#x27;m spooked for very un-festive reasons.

                              <span>Currently anxious about a counteroffer I made today. So the job offered me $25 an hr which is $52K. I had the interview this past Monday-nailed my interview including the interview with the V.P. However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week. I wouldn’t start this job until Nov 7, after my two weeks notice with my current company so the delayed acceptance is not an issue.

                              <span>things happened. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure I remember everything. But when I woke up a server with 384 GB (16GB x 24 DDR4 2133MHz) was in my rack. 
 I have no idea what to do with so much RAM. Like, I was running a bunch of VMs and all kinds of craziness and I was hitting 10% utilization at its peak. 
 There must be something cool I can run on this server that would need this much. Any ideas?

                              <span>Man, I just have to get this out there to see if anyone else has dealt with this.
 I work for a health org, so we have about 1200 or so Windows Servers (99% virtualized, on-prem). We monitor just about everything through vROPs when it comes to CPU/RAM/Disk/IOPS etc; but most important of all, Windows Services. All related tickets go to our 24/7 NOC
 We are currently on a vROPs version that is... well past N-1, so we were directed to switch. We chose vROPs cloud.
 When I first heard of the riddance of End Point Operations Management Agent (EPOPS) with vROPs cloud, I felt relief. That agent was truly a POS for some reason in our environment and a pain to deal with if it broke... Anyways... What I didn&#x27;t know though is VMWare changed the way Windows Services were discovered entirely.

                              <span>Strangest issue i have run into in a long long time.
 Network: Comcast static IP on business cable modem not resolving MX record for verizon.net
 I am trying to resolve an MX record for verizon.net and it&#x27;s failing with no records found.
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nslookup
 Default Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 &gt; set type&#x3D;mx
 &gt; verizon.net
 Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 *** No mail exchange (MX) records available for verizon.net
 I have determined that this is happening on multiple cable based business comcast networks all with static IPs.
 If anyone can check and report back also? If so, no idea how or to whom to report this?It&#x27;s fine on a Verizon static FIOS network and on a Comcast fiber network, and on a home Comcast cable network just not on a static cable based business Comcast network...
 And i also tried changing DNS servers within nslookup with the same result... so something is blocking MX resolution for verizon.net but just on Comcast business cable connections!?!
 If anyone else is experiencing this as a workaround i setup a send connector scoped for that one domain using smarthost:

The first was a tech issue that would have had an embarrassing impact on a high profile quarterly event. It was identified a week prior by the executive support team, but not reported to anyone until 16 hours before the event started. This caused everyone to scramble and brainstorm a solution. After an hour, I proposed a solid workaround that would absolutely work to get us through the event which would buy us more time to work on a permanent solution.

 Our executive was furious, because he wanted a *permanent* solution *right away*, despite my protests that it would take days to really understand it, test it, validate it, document it, implement it, then test it aga…</span>

 I&#x27;m currently leveraging the crap out of this because it simplifies the firewall policies considerably. But I&#x27;m curious if PA has something similar (or better?). What other vendors provide this functionality?
 I read, a few minutes ago, that there is now an AWS native PA firewall? 
 Anyway, thanks everyone!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some suggestions on what hardware to purchase for a firewall and switch. We are a small company and the budget is limited. We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) &lt;10 ports required
 Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$. We only really need a single WAN port and 5 LAN ports (make that 10 to allow for expansion). Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports. Does anyone know of other product databases one can use or have any personal suggestions (including a different design utilising multiple boxes)? Any help much appreciated.

                              <span>We currently have 4 sites and all are connected to our main office through IPsec tunnels with ASA. Problem is ASAs are a pain in the ass when it comes to just about anything, so we are slowly moving towards FortiGates. But also if our HQ goes down we lose all communication to the other sites (internally).
 So in the meantime, I&#x27;m looking for the simplest way to get a Mesh VPN network with the ASAs. Is this feasible? I can&#x27;t find much on the topic. Or do I just wait and implement when we get new gear?

                              <span>Looking for recommendations for non-Cisco PoE access switches that can hold up to below freezing, or even subzero F temperatures. Don&#x27;t need to be outdoor rated per se, will be indoors, just not a climate controller indoors, so harsh temperature/humidity exposure.
  
L2 only is fine
 at least 5 10/100/1000 PoE or PoE+ ports
 at least 2 SFP+ (might be able to compromise with SFP)
 AC powered preferred (no need for dual/redundant power)
  
Looking at the usual suspects, Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN looks like it might be a price winner, but only lists ambient temperatures and not operating temperatures? None of the Mikrotik outdoor-rated switches seem to check all the boxes. Aruba&#x27;s rugged CX 4100i seems perfect on paper, anyone have experience they can share with those?
 Would also be open to older generation, used/refurbished units if it means I don&#x27;t have to wait for any huge supply chain backlogs

                              <span>I oversee a few campus networks where each campus currently has 1 subnet/network for voice and data that spans multiple buildings.
 I&#x27;d like to create a VLAN (200) specifically for the phones but use a unique subnet per building. This will allow us to tell the phone system if network &#x3D; 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.
 Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24
 Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24
 Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 
 Currently all Buildings have a &#x27;data&#x27; VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 
 IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i&#x27;ve every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don&#x27;t seem to support this. (I hate these switches) 
 My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn&#x27;t easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. 
 My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won&#x27;t act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i&#x27;d have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. 
 Is there a solution that I&#x27;m not seeing to accomplish this? (Besides buying new switches lol)

 I&#x27;ve got two 5G connections which are 1000/100Mbps rated.
 ERX seems to peak at about 800-850Mbps with HW offloading enabled.
 was wondering if port aggregation coupled with load ballancing the two connections could make more use of the available WAN bandwidth?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I am going to be doing some wireless surveys pretty soon, and was looking to see if anyone had suggestions on building an AP on a stick cart? I have an AP, I have one of those standard two shelf utility carts, UPS, and a small PoE switch for power conversion. What I don&#x27;t know is how I can get the height that I need to lift a pole up and down? My ceilings are going to be 10ft for the most part, so I don&#x27;t think building something with static height will work very well.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking at using sr-iov to improve our VoIP application within kubernetes on bare metal. I&#x27;ve got a pod using multus to move the sr-iov VF into the interface and this works fine, but am I done?
 Does the fact that I have the VF in the function now mean that I am bypassing the host os networking stack and could theoretically achieve line performance or is there more I need to do? 
 I&#x27;ve done lots of research but I&#x27;m still pretty confused how this actually works. My current understanding is the network driver mounted into the kernel does the magic that means the standard network stack is avoided allowing the performance improvements, is this right?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to this group, I hope someone is able to help. 
 We have several Rukus Zoneflex R310 access points in our network, which was originally set up by a third party. I need to change the IP address for our access points which are currently on a 172.16 range. They need to be changed to a 192.168 range. However, whenever I enter the correct IP address to access the browser login page for the AP, I get a 503 service unavailable error. The IP address is definately correct and I have tried accessing it both wirelessly and through a physical connection via our LAN switch. Either way I&#x27;m getting the same 503 error and therefore can&#x27;t make the necessary changes. 
 Any ideas? 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I am trying to run a script to check complaince with switches. I got it working for the most part, but ran into a roadblock.
 My task I am trying to do now is to check is a specific ACL exists, and then to also verify it is placed on one of the vty lines. Normally, I would start by doing something like this....
 Output &#x3D; net_connect.send_command (&#x27;show ip access-list&#x27;) if &quot;ACL NAME&quot; in Output: print (&#x27;Compliant&#x27;) else: print (&#x27;Not Compliant&#x27;) 
 That works, but I also want to verify that it is place in the right location. So I could do another function like above to run a &quot;show run | sec line vty&quot; and verify that &quot;ACL NAME&quot; is in the Output. But that would be 2 different functions and 2 different print statements.
 Is there a way I can run both of those checks and have one print statement if they are both compliant?
 I was thinking I could do something like this....
 def check_acl(Output) if &quot;ACL NAME&quot; in Output: return True return False Output &#x3D; net_connect.send_command (&#x27;show ip access-list&#x27;) if check_acl(Output): print (&#x27;Compliant&#x27;) else: print (&#x27;Not Compliant&#x27;) 
 I was thinking I could do 2 def statements then have the function check for both def statements, but I am getting lost with that.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to start a new project where I need some devices which will be configured with OSPF and stacking or MLAG. So far I had setups with Cisco 6500 (no stacking here but dual supervisors), 2x Brocade ICX 6610 in stacking, 2x Dell 6224 in stacking. What I can say is that cisco and brocade were both extremely stable while dell had CPU usage issues along side other minor issues. Obviously all options I used so far are very old and I would like to try something new which consume less power.
 I was looking at Arista DCS-7050TX or Dell S4048-ON (I know there is a risk of Clock Signal failure, or was there?). Any suggestions or maybe different options? And yes I am sure these options are a bit older too but for this personal project I would go with something refurbished. Thank you :)

                              <span>Long time IT admin but only just getting into setting fiber networks. I&#x27;ve got a number of Dell hosts PE640 with QLogic 4x10GE QL41164HMCU. I can use either Dell DAC cables or SFPs to connect these to a Dell S5048F-ON but regardless of which I use none of the ports light up. 
 I&#x27;ve tried setting the &#x27;no shutdown&#x27; command on the interface but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. If I connect the cables from host to host the NICs light up fine. 
 Is there something really basic I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m posting here because i’m a bit lost and I don’t know what to do with my career. I’m a network engineer currently working in the banking industry. Currently I work a lot on campus networking and especially Wifi (Cisco and Aruba) and NAC stuff (mostly ISE), but I’m one of the few in the team which is able to work on almost every perimeter (LAN, WIFI, Automation, Routing, Security).
 Right now I don’t really know what would be best for my career, I could dig more in WIFI for exemple and become a specialist in one of those field or keep being a « jack of all trade master of none ». But i’m always afraid by choosing to become a specialist on a field, WiFi, i’m closing myself some doors and be less futur proof in my career.
 So I’m interested from your experience what do you think would be best to do ?
 Thanks a lot

                              <span>My understanding is that a 20m cat 6 cable should be fine, but it is causing intermittent problems in linux. Oddly it works fine with windows.
 If I replace it with a short cable it works fine, so it is definitely the cable.
 Not sure if it&#x27;s a dodgy cable or if I am getting lots of electromagnetic interference.
 Should I buy a shielded cable? or perhaps a cat 7. or is there some way to make linux run on a more unstable connecton since windows seems fine with it.

                              <span>Never ran across this before in 15 years... 
 Existing gear in IDF1 was a Cisco 2960x with 1gig link back to MDF (Meraki ms425).
 Upgraded IDF1 to Meraki ms225 and new 10gig MMF SFP last night. Had issues trying to get the fiber link up. Tried rolling fiber at IDF. Tried rolling fiber at MDF. Tried different patch cable at IDF side. Now what worked was rolling at BOTH sides. Once that link came up (and at 10gig), I was like - that doesn&#x27;t make sense so we tested and rolled them both back and tried all other combinations, fail.
 Fast forward to tonight. Same site, different IDF, same MDF switch. Link wouldn&#x27;t come up after new gear was in. I said let&#x27;s roll both sides at the same time. Link came up. What the hell?
 The only thing I can think of is - at the MDF side, fiber patch cables are orange, but there&#x27;s about a foot of distance leading starting at its LC connector where ONE of the strands turns yellow. Where it transitions orange, there&#x27;s about 2 inches of some sort of shrink wrap and the cable gets slightly bulkier there. The other strand is orange the whole way. It looks factory made. I haven&#x27;t been able to find an image of those online. 
 Who know what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We use Symantec Email.Security Cloud. Yes, I know, Broadcom stuff. Don&#x27;t ask about it.
 This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.
 So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won&#x27;t work anymore. 
 Worked with Broadcom&#x27;s support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. 
 Support adviced to:
 - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.
 - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don&#x27;t ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.
 - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security &amp; Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )
 - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. 
 - And that&#x27;s it...supposedly.
 Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 &quot;get-recipient&quot; and that causes a timeout for us for just the &quot;user&quot; sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against &quot;get-EXOrecipient&quot;, which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom&#x27;s developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).
 Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom&#x27;s stuff.

                              <span>We&#x27;re a mixed Mac/Windows shop in a company that is finally taking IT seriously after just handing out laptops to users with no management for years. The Mac side of things is covered with MDM now as that was the first priority because it&#x27;s a larger user base. We&#x27;re looking at Intune because zero-touch provisioning is a huge priority for us so we&#x27;d like to get our hands on Autopilot.
 The catch is, from my understanding Autopilot requires Azure Premium licenses, but we would only need that feature for the minority of users we have on Windows. There are plenty of Mac users who do want/need Office 365 licenses and we&#x27;d like to keep things all integrated, with our Okta deployment automatically provisioning/de-provisioning users in Azure. But we want to make sure we only pay for licenses each …</span>

 Right now I can&#x27;t see the health of our servers without logging into them and reading our daily email from AJTech, and I&#x27;m way too lazy to do that every day. How are people monitoring that their WSUS servers are properly downloading patches? I&#x27;d like to get this into zabbix and grafana but I&#x27;m not really sure where to start on this.

 Help me r/sysadmin, you&#x27;re my only hope...

                              <span>The company i&#x27;m working for (in Europe) isn&#x27;t doing good financially right now. I already saw some colleagues leaving because their contracts didn&#x27;t get extended and now also our budget is downsized to 1/7 of the intentional budget.
 I spoke with my manager and the other tech about all the things happening right now and they both told me in confidence they are already applying for another job. Also the people on our IT helpdesk are already fired.
 The fun fact is that I&#x27;m also busy finding another job and the three of us (manager, other tech and me) are the last sys admins for the company. So we are probably all going to leave the company in a couple of weeks without a replacement and I want to leave as much information behind for my successor(s).
 Besides of documentation, what can I do to make it as easy as possible for the people that will replace us?

                              <span>We are working for multiple customers. Mostly we administrate some servers or databases for those (so we run Ansible, we connect to databases, replace certificates and such tasks). Every customer is sharing us a VPN – mostly personal accounts with 2FA, not a site-to-site or a general VPN account. This means that every new colleague is getting a new VPN account. Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …
 As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN&#x27;s up.
 We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.
 So: I&#x27;m looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN&#x27;s. I&#x27;m currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.
 How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations? It can be a technical solution, as we&#x27;re mostly developers, system engineers or similar.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Currently our company has a weekly rotation of technicians who end up on call. Last night I had about 6 alerts come in from one location. It was about 1.5 hours of afterhours work and then it was resolved at about 11:00 PM.
 Later throughout the night, I had two more alerts come in around 1:45 and 3:00 AM that were short term disruptions that resolved themselves. In addition, I had two clients call in at 3:00 AM and then 5:00 AM about their VPN connection not operating. I missed these two calls, and my manager is furious with me because &quot;that is what is expected of the on-call person.&quot;
 Is it reasonable to expect someone who receives alerts like this, respond to them throughout the night and be expected to start work at 8:00AM the next day and work a full 8-hour shift? Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.
 Am I wrong for thinking about it this way? What are your thoughts on this or what expectations does your company set?

                              <span>I am looking to audit Teams calls with some simple data: Date, Participants, Duration, Activity type.
 I have found some good help for auditing Teams &quot;meetings&quot; https://github.com/admindroid-community/powershell-scripts/blob/master/Audit%20Teams%20meetings/AuditTeamsMeetings.ps1 - this script generates a file that tracks internal &quot;meetings&quot;
 I have not found any resources or guides on how to audit &quot;activity type &#x3D; calls&quot; with PowerShell.
 Currently, I can navigate to admin.teams.microsoft.com &gt; Users &gt; Manage user &gt; $user &gt; Meetings &amp; calls and I can see call history there. But I can&#x27;t find any resources on how to grab that with PowerShell and export it to a different data source. Ideally I would like to get it into a CSV and later visualize it with PowerBI.

                              <span>Hi Friends,
 Some of our users access another company&#x27;s application, they use their email address and password from our sync&#x27;d AD.
 The thing is, their accounts all have expired passwords, yet they are still validated and can use this application.
 Should Microsoft not recognize its an expired password and deny access?
 If they log in locally on our domain they are prompted to change their password and can&#x27;t login until they do - but this cloud app simply authenticates them.
 Friends, what am I missing?

                              <span>Basically all the people who get paid more than they should at this company and think they are very important, are suddenly demanding I find a way to turn off 2FA on all their sites and services. Those here before me started the process of turning it on everywhere, and got stopped and canned for attempting it, even after getting the okay and explaining/communicating the process company-wide. They also want to make it so screens don&#x27;t lock automatically, and want to use a single shared account for all the public workstations (meeting rooms and such) instead of logging in with their own account or bringing a laptop for presentations.
 Basically C-Suite says: I want all the computers to be unlocked and working before I get near them
 But my experience says: 2FA everything, lock every screen after 10-20 minutes of no activity, detect and disconnect mouse jigglers if needed, and always use unique accounts even at public kiosks
 This company is constantly under attack from phishing/spoofing and can&#x27;t afford to pay for better M365 tiers to mitigate it. One of the IT Directors used the password Passwerd2020 a couple years ago, and the pen tester was able to use that account to find and access a full AD backup (don&#x27;t have more detail on this, but it was bad).
 Seems they should be freaking out about how bad their security is, instead the execs are just trying to poke more convenience holes. Is there a psychological trick or some kind of magic words that get this through? Can I just say it&#x27;s synergetic and get them to turn around? I&#x27;m not great at dealing with people who don&#x27;t accept the truth and want to see IT as an obstruction.
 It&#x27;s like having people say &quot;It&#x27;s really inconvenient, remove the deadbolts on my doors. The handle has a lock, why do I need two?&quot; over and over.

Internally hosted ticketing system running osTicket v1.17 (currently the latest version) is running on an Apache v2.4 web server and functions properly. 
 
An NGINX reverse proxy server is used to allow for https access internally and externally to said ticketing system.
 
 Problem:
 Microsoft Oauth2 for email authentication is not working. This guide works for getting everything setup with Microsoft Azure and then configuring the client, but the Redirect link errors out. 
 I&#x27;ve reached out to the developers and was told that as long as Apache rewrite mod is enabled, and it is, then I need to adjust the NGINX rules to allow the API urls to be rewritten successfully.

                              <span>One of my clients requested a laptop for a new manager they had hired. We told then we would have the laptop ready for setup today. So I go over to the client with the laptop, docking station, and two 27 inch monitors. 
 Manager comes off as a bit of jerk, but this isn&#x27;t a client I deal with much, so whatever. 
 Until I presented him with the laptop usage agreement. See, about a year ago, shortly after we added this client, we helped them draft Device Usage Agreements for users. 
 Pretty basic stuff. Date, Serial Number, condition issued, agreement for work purposes, cannot install/uninstall software, etc.
 Dude loses his absolute mind. Refuses to sign. Starts talking about how &quot;No one is going to tell him what he can or can&#x27;t do with his laptop!&quot;
 Anyway, owner was walking by during the rant. Guy no longer has a job or a laptop. Owner is convinced they dodged a bullet. 
 Happy Friday!

It was created as [user@company.com](mailto:user@company.com), I can still log in to it as an individual Apple account even though company.com is now registered as a domain in the new ABM account.
 [user@company.com](mailto:user@company.com) does not appear in the user list in the business admin page, and I can&#x27;t add it since the ID already exists. Is there a way to get this account into my managed environment?
 Also, when resetting a Mac, does it also reset the owner? I&#x27;m going to be testing and want to be able to emulate out of box.

                              <span>I purchased M365 Business Standard for a small org (20 users) last year and found it to be pretty user friendly. I like the Admin Center controls and for the small amount of time/things that I need to manage for this org, it&#x27;s served me well. 
 We are looking into using this for a different org (about 40 users), and found that it&#x27;s a bit cheaper through a 3rd-party. But I&#x27;m wondering if we will not have the same &quot;admin center&quot; abilities as the one I purchased through Microsoft. Does anyone have any experience with buying M365 Business Standard through a 3rd-party? We will be using on-prem AD and Exchange (probably Hybrid).

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just got a new role at a new place and noticed every switch here is a layer 3 switch performing some routing capabilities.
 Just curious about the industry and architecture. Is it typical to have access layer switches have ip routing enabled on it? (I saw some post that said there’s no need to turn it off)
 What are your thoughts!

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to prevent spoofing with a approved email list in office 365
 I want to make a rule that checks if an email is part of our exchange and if not than to reject the message. we are pretty small only about 80 email users spread between 3 buildings. we never get hit with spoofed email of real people in our company but we always get hit with spoofed emails of our domain with a fake person and our users get tricked into giving info because they think this is someone new at a different building.
 I know I can do this in exchange rules but I would always need to add a new user to the approved list\ Group every time a new person is hired. I want it to be automatic when a user is created.

I have been looking through the firewall to see if there is a setting for the SMTP server or does it magically talk back to Sophos HQ and send the reports? (those are under logging &amp; reporting). Its for some reason stopped a few weeks before I started here.

                              <span>some time ago i decided to change jobs in a hope to get some motivation back (I was working night-shift in a medium sized enterprise). 
 i now got a job in a tech startup (30+ employees 70 R&amp;D) I have never worked in a start up before and most of my experience has been from larger organizations or enterprises. 
 Before i joined the company all systems administration has been done by DevOps and the CISO, so most if not all systems have never been setup properly, lots of software or other systems are still running trial versions that in some cases are expired with limited functionality. every day is a new challenge to just maintain a proper production. 
 I am hired as the IT systems administrator, so everything with IT, user management, Governance, risk and compliance falls under my scope. 
 With this whole mess that i am trying to balance I am slowly starting to lose my mind, and my motivation is long gone. 
 How do you keep the motivation up?
 it has been so bad for me that i have even considered if i should start working in a completely different line of work (oh yeah, I applied for a job in the local Lidl because the benefits are better then what i get now) 
 I actually don&#x27;t expect any replies, just needed to get this off my chest

                              <span>Hi all,
 So we have had an Android developer inform us that they were trying to use Android Studio with emulated (enrolled) devices but when trying to use certain features that require &quot;Verify Apps over USB&quot; to be disabled they can&#x27;t. When I looked at their device it shows that it is enabled and the config profile assigned is the same as the one on my test device.
 What is weird is that my device shows as disabled, we have the exact same config profile assigned and all I can see is that the developer options settings is allowed from the list of settings.
 Anyone know where this setting sits or is named under in android config profile settings.
 Thanks

                              <span>Has anyone else seen office 365, word excel etc lock up temporarily because it is searching for printer. However, at times the printer is not always available because the person is mobile, not in the office, and not connected to the VPN. 
 We can reproduce the issue regularly by going onto a network that doesn&#x27;t have permission to the print serve, open word, and edit margins. Word then locks up while searching for the printer (which it can&#x27;t find the default printer because they are not on the VPN or Network with permission to the printer). Eventually times out and seems to remember the time out for that session of word. It does cause other delays also
 Others are saying they get around it by setting a default printer to the local PDF writer but that isn&#x27;t really the best option. 
 It seems office is trying to connect to get the page setup information from the printer. Is there a setting somewhere to change this behavior. We are kind of stumped at the moment.

                              <span>Saw the post about the HR person who had to feel what we go through all the time. It really got me thinking about all the abuse I&#x27;ve had to deal with over the past 20-odd years. Fellow employees yelling over the phone about tickets that aren&#x27;t even in your queue. Long nights migrating servers or rewiring entire buildings, come in after zero sleep for &quot;one tiny thing&quot; and still get chewed out by the Executive&#x27;s assistant about it. Ask someone to follow a process and make a ticket before grabbing me in a hallway and you&#x27;d think I killed their cat.
 Our pay scales are out of wack, every company is just looking to undercut IT salaries because we &quot;make too much&quot;. So no one talks about it except on Glassdoor because we don&#x27;t want to find out the guy who barely does anything makes 10x my salary.
 Our responsibilities are usually not clearly defined, training is on our own time, unpaid overtime is &#x27;normal&#x27;, and we have to take abuse from many sides. &quot;Other duties as needed&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean I know how to fix the HVAC.
 Would a Worker&#x27;s Union be beneficial to SysAdmins/DevOps/IT/IS? Why or why not?
 I&#x27;m sorry if this is a stupid question. I guess I kind of wanted to vent. Have an awesome Read-Only Friday everyone.

                              <span>I have a company ThermoFisher that makes software that doesn&#x27;t seem to work on our normal Windows 10 install with a normal user. One of the steps they&#x27;re telling the user is to make sure IE3.0 is installed, or to install axdist.exe for active X libraries. 
 Before I tell the user again that IE11 is (currently) PART OF Win10, and trying to install IE3.0 or IE 3.0 libraries for active X doesn&#x27;t make any sense - I&#x27;m doing a sanity check. How likely is this to break the Win 10 install if it&#x27;ll even install at all?

I need to be able to monitor our backup server over a weekend to see if we are having any resource bottlenecks with CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage (I/O), including local disk, SAN and tape storage. Can i use Windows Performance Monitor to look at all of those resources over a weekend? Can anyone recommend a good &quot;Performance Monitor for dummies startup guide&quot;? either documented or instructional video? everytime i try to figure PM out, i always end of getting confused by all the options.

I have worked for about 2 years and everything become easy no there are no new experiences, my wage is normal not high not low. I&#x27;ve applied many times for larger companies with higher positions but I always decided to remain where I am because the wages weirdly are lower there even with higher position!! I started using my free time at work to learn web development I learned HTML, CSS, and now I am making my way in JavaScript, and guess what? I like this domain more than Network Engineering and I decided to keep improving and start moving my career to web development. but now after all this time I got an offer for a network admin position with like double my current wage in an MSP company but with more more Pressure and with more working hours 6days 9hours a day (I work now 5 days 7hours a day) I am lost what should I do know? should I move to this new position as a network admin or keep working where I am and improve myself in web development to shift my career?

More and more we are going the Chromebook route, much to our dismay, for our student one to one device program. Our Chromebooks connect to our WPA2 SSID via a username/password combo that goes through RADIUS. This is the only allowed user for authentication on that network aside from admins at the schools and their personal devices. Last year the password was cracked, it wasn&#x27;t very secure and had been the same for about eight years, so we decided once summer rolled around we would disable that user, create a new one and use a ridiculous 100 character password via a password generator. Fast forward to now and somehow the students at a high school have gotten ahold of this new password. We do …</span>

But people still reported issues which I isolated to Google Calendar invites. So I set up DKIM for Gmail and go the DNS provider to add that TX record. 
 After enabling authentication, I&#x27;m finding the &quot;Sending email&quot; dialog in Thunderbird on my laptop sat there for ages before sending. Sending email from the GMail web UI didn&#x27;t do this. Now, some ten minutes or so later, I tried again from Thunderbird and there was a flicker of a pause, but nothing like before. So I&#x27;m hoping the initial long delays were just because the DNS changes were propagating. Can I hope this is the case? Can anyone verify that just after enabling DKIM, a pause sending emails is expected and is due to DNS which will ease over the next 24-48 hours?

 I read something about new / preview options to secure your azure MFA better. I think there were new options introduced. Something that should make it unphishable and at the same time address MFA fatigue.
 I just can&#x27;t find the post nor can I find it at Microsoft.
 Can someone point me there?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently installed the Intune Certificate Connector on my on-prem CA. When I launch the application and start configuring it, I run into an issue after the Azure AD Sign In stage - A very generic &#x27;Something went wrong&#x27; error as shown below. 
 Something went wrong An unanticipated error occurred. Your IT department may be able to help.

 I&#x27;m running the application as an administrator with my domain admin account, I can see a successful login for my Service Account in Azure when I get to the Azure AD sign in stage, but I get this error! Has anyone seen this before or have any suggestions on what I could try or even where to troubleshoot?

                              <span>I work for a SMB that treats everything IT related as an expense. The CFO doesn&#x27;t want to deal with depreciation of IT assets. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is cause for some many of my frustrations, as we are under new leadership in the C suite who is trying to pinch every penny they can.

 some of our users cant login to ADFS. We are testing this webpage https://adfs.contoso.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm, but login prompt popup. In local intranet we have https://adfs.contoso.com, user is connected into internal network, hes getting internal ip of ADFS, but even If he entered right credentials connection is reset and login prompt popu again. I cant see any events on ADFS (have verbose logging). I dont really know where could be a problem. Hes using Chrome, Edge, Firefox nothing works. 
 Any idea? Ty

 Is there any way to block specific Microsoft Store Apps via GPO?
 Or even better, to block them all but have a list of selected Apps which are allowed? 
 (I am not talking about blocking the Microsoft Store in its entirety, i only want to block/allow specific apps)

                              <span>Yes, of course it&#x27;s DNS....
 I&#x27;ve got one server (Windows Server 2022 VM on Nutanix AHV) that&#x27;s having problems doing DNS lookups. Not consistently, it can usually ping the DCs in its domain and in the forest root above it. But the lookups tend to be slow. And many other servers in the domain don&#x27;t resolve.
 I&#x27;ve done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn&#x27;t previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I&#x27;ve removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I&#x27;ve switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It&#x27;s using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they&#x27;re all fine.
 &quot;Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53&quot; connects successfully (as does DC2).
 If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won&#x27;t resolve the name.
 Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN. I&#x27;ve tried putting a random dot at the end of both as per some ancient article I found on Google, but that doesn&#x27;t work either.
 This server has just gone live to the whole business, so I really don&#x27;t want to rebuild it if I can avoid it, but I&#x27;ll try most non-destructive things out of hours. I&#x27;ve got good backups of it but I don&#x27;t really know when this started.

 Is there a way to make external bootable SSD to work in only one specific computer (Mac OS) ?

                              <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m looking for ways to centrally manage access to customer, and internal servers. Servers are 95% accessed by RDP, if not, TeamViewer.
 Some customers we&#x27;ve got shared admin credentials to, others we&#x27;ve got personal credentials on, and we&#x27;ll need to be able to use both - with personal ones only known to the individual user.
 Today we&#x27;re using Royal TS and managing document (RDP/gateway/credential folder) access with Azure Security Groups -&gt; AADDS Security Groups.
 We&#x27;re a Windows house, fully onboard with Azure, with all that it entails.
 ​
 Need to have:
  
Centrally managed access controle. This can happen any which way, fx via Security Groups.
 
Logging. Access log is a must have.
 
Automated emergency access.
 
Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory Domain Services integration.
 
Windows and Mac support.
 
Helpful vendor support.
 
Session recording.
 
GDPR compliant. 
 
Admin and user rights.
 
 ​
 Nice to have:
  
PIM/PAM support.
 
Password management from the same vendor - for passwords not related to the servers.
 
PowerShell manageable if applicable (it&#x27;s nice not to have to go through every single setup point, for hundreds of customers).
 
Auditing for GDPR (if applicable).
 
 ​
 If PAM is included, I&#x27;m looking for cheaper alternatives than Delinia/Thycotic and Cyberark. (Though if a good price can be provided, they&#x27;re in the loop)

                              <span>I have a RDS deployment that i am trying to get SSO for the &quot;RemoteApp and Remote Desktop connection&quot; feed url to work.
 I have trusted certificates on all RDS roles.
 I have changed the Authentication Method on RDWeb in IIS to Windows Authentication.
 i have Changed the web.config in the Pages folder, commented out Form Auth and the needed modules and security sections.
 I have changed the Default.aspx to use bPrivateMode &#x3D; true
 I have deployed the &quot;Allow Delegating default credentials&quot; set to TERMSRV/*.company.local, also tried with FQDN of all RDS server.
 I have added all RDS servers to Site to Zone Assignment List, tried zone both 1 and 2 with FQDN
 Set the &quot;Logon Options&quot; to &quot;Automatic logon with current username and password&quot;.
 I have disabled &quot;Prompt for credentials on the client computer&quot;.
 I have deployed the &quot;Use Locally logged-on credentials&quot;.
 I have specified the SHA1 thumbprint as trusted RDP publisher from the Connection Broker certificate.
 In both Edge(Chromium) and Internet Explorer the SSO works for the urls needed.
 https://rdweb.company.local/RDWeb
 https://rdweb.company.local/RDWeb/Feed/webfeed.aspx
 But when i try to add the url in the &quot;RemoteApp andf Remote Desktop Connections&quot; under controlpanel it says &quot;Incorrect username or password&quot;, this makes the auto deployment of the url impossible.
 Is there a setting i have forgotten to set or is this a lost cause?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 A really strange but replicable issue has arised.
 When a user forwards an email in the ios outlook app that contains pictures (such as a logo in the signature or inline images) ALL images in the email (including previous mails in the same email) become one of the images. 
 This only happens if you select &quot;Expand previous mesasge&quot; (rough translation, sorry) during the forward. You can see that all images gets turned inte one of the images in the &quot;edit-mode&quot; but that is not necessarily the same one that gets sent.
 We have the lates ios outlook and ios 16.03
 Have you seen anything like this?
 To try it yourself: 
  
Open an email with pictures 
 
Select Forward
 
Click &quot;Expand Message&quot; / &quot;Show full message&quot;
 
All the images gets turned into one of the pictures
 
 Optional:
  
Send the email
 
All the images could turn into one of the other images in the mail

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking to get a new UPS for our office as the current one is essentially a very heavy paper weight. 
 I&#x27;m not looking to spend loads and really only need enough backup time to shut everything down safely (5-10 minutes max).
 The equipment I have is below:
 Watchguard M270: 75W
 US-48-500W: 500W x 2
 UAP-AC-Pro: 9W x 3
 Poweredge R320: 350W x 2
 HP Microserver: 200W 
 Total: 2002W 
 Preferably I&#x27;d like it under £1000 but could stretch to perhaps £1250-1500 if really required.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I&#x27;ve been working at an old fashioned (small and rather niche) MSP for the last 10 years and will soon make the move to a well-known and bigger company. With a good bump to my salary. As smaller MSPs are, I&#x27;ve got a rather broad spectrum of skills but I am no master in a lot of those. Well, that may be knocking myself a bit down, but you get the gist.
 My new employer put me into a department that will also be focused on providing managed services with some focus on cloudy stuff as well as even providing private cloud instances to customers. I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that&#x27;s about it :-D)
 I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.
 Be that as it may, tldr, I&#x27;d love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff? I&#x27;d like not to focus on a specific manufacturer, but if they provide good content I don&#x27;t mind.
 Thank you very, very much!

 Problem 8(using link): I know that the window size is how many frames it can transfer at a time. 
 In this scenario, the first 3 frames are sent, and B would have to send an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec and therefore, 30 msec after the frame transmission begins. 
 How I interpret it:
  
Frame 1 takes 10 msec to arrive from A to B
 I don&#x27;t understand &quot;The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec, and therefore, 30 msec&quot; Are we still talking about frame 1? 
  
​
 This is the diagram i&#x27;ve written to help me understand it:
  
I have 10 frames(10 boxes)
 A sender with vert line, and B is receiver with vert line: frames 1,2,3 are sent.
 Frame 1 takes 10 msec to transmit from A to B
 Frame 2 takes 10 msec after frame A is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 Frame 3 takes 10 msec after frame B is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 3 frames fill up the window, so receiver has to send out an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. Window slides, and A is able to send another frame to B, then B sends acknowledgement again and it repeats. 
  
The bullet point I bolded is what I am struggling with. My teacher has tried explaining this to me, but I&#x27;m not grasping that way of interpreting it.

 I&#x27;m working on a shell script to get the download link for this Lansweeper agent. 
 The original link is https://content.lansweeper.com/lsagent-mac/
 However, I would like to get this redirect link: https://cdn.lansweeper.com/download/10.2.0/0/LsAgent-osx.dmg
 I want to use the original link so I can always get the latest version.
 The curl script I used was this:
 curl -Ls -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://content.lansweeper.com/lsagent-mac/ 
 But I keep getting the original link: https://content.lansweeper.com/lsagent-mac/
 How to get the redirect link that is used to download?
 Thank you.

 I am not angry. I&#x27;m more disappointed and frustrated.
  
Strike one: I only go there once a year to register. In the last three years, my account ID has changed three times. I have three ID&#x27;s from Swizzonic.
 Strike two: I received an email invoice with a link to renew. I went to renew, using the existing user/pass combo. I was told my password was invalid. I checked the domain, just to be sure I was not being scammed. billing.swizzonic.ch/. I tried logging in a couple more times and was locked out for too many attempts.
