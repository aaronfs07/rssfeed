                              <span>So we are going to be rolling out windows 11 across all laptops soon but one really annoying issue keeps appearing .
 When joined to the domain and ran windows updates, after the first 2/3 reboots of the device we seem to loose the ability to log into windows 11. There is no username or password options on the page, just the blurry acrylic look.
 I&#x27;m struggling to find out the root cause of this issue or a permanent solution to prevent this happening. These are brand new out the box hp laptops. 
 I am going to reimage one with a windows bootable usb (created within windows and no other 3rd party apps) but this is becoming increasingly common and frustrating.

                              <span>First post...
 We are re-cabling the data center from copper to fiber. We need about 200 patch om4 LC patch cables to connect switch and servers. Some are &quot;standard&quot; lenghts, some must be ordered (2 months delivery time).
 We have a company that helps us to install patch panels/cassettes and has the tool to join the fibers. We&#x27;d like to ask them to buy/expand their equipment to create patch cords, so that we may have them in a short time and with correct lenght (as they already do for copper).
 Does anybody make its own patch cords this way? Possible problems to be aware?
 Thanks

 My boss has a website on WordPress. He wants to install a free uptime monitor to fit their needs (1 min checks, email notifs for down time). I found that PHPServerMonitor is one of the simplest according to reddit?
 I have zero knowledge on this. How do I install it? I tried reading the documentation but I do not understand even the first step. 
 It says to upload the files to my webserver? Does that mean wordpress?
 Kindly help me out.

                              <span>Hyia, we&#x27;re currently moving to a new school site and this will be the occasion to rearrange configuration and settings.
 We currently have these VLANs:
  
Core: Servers and on premise trusted workstations
 Staff: BYOD and mobile phones
 Guest: Students and guests
 Printers: to allow selected VLANs to print
 PBX: as it says
  
Now, apart from adding a videosurveillance system, which will use its own VLAN, we&#x27;re wondering if it makes sense to separate servers (Active Directory) from on premise trusted workstations. 
 What we would achieve: 
  
Security: By segregating servers and workstations, you create a logical separation between them. This helps in implementing stricter security policies and access controls. Even if the server firewall is compromised, an attacker would still need to bypass additional security measures to gain access to the workstations&#x27; network.
 Reduced Attack Surface: Placing servers and workstations on separate VLANs limits the exposure of critical server resources to potential threats originating from workstations. It minimizes the attack surface, reducing the chances of unauthorized access, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.
 Performance Optimization: Servers often require more bandwidth and have different traffic patterns compared to workstations. By segregating them on separate VLANs, you can prioritize and optimize network resources for server traffic, ensuring efficient communication and reducing the risk of congestion caused by workstation-related traffic.
  
Now thinking of the extra complexity layer added by the above setup. Implementing Inter-VLAN Routing, to allow for controlled communication between VLANs. By selectively permitting specific traffic between VLANs, you can ensure that essential services, such as DNS, DHCP, domain authentication, print queues, and file shares, remain accessible to workstations but this might be a long trial and error process
 Your thoughts?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m seeking advice on choosing an UPS to protect and power a NAS, a router, and a PC during blackouts, allowing me to safely shut them down.
 I&#x27;ve familiarized myself with different types of UPS (online, offline, line interactive) and waveform characteristics.
 I have the opportunity to purchase an APC Back-UPS Pro 1500 or an APC Smart-UPS. The main difference I&#x27;ve noticed between the two is that the Smart-UPS offers a pure sine wave.
 In addition, both UPS models are available at a highly competitive price of 150€.
 What other factors should I consider in my decision? And which of the two models would you recommend?
 Thank you for your assistance.

                              <span>Hi here&#x27;s the problem - when you get a certificate drop-down selection prompt in Edge or Chrome, how do I prevent it from showing certificates belonging to previous users?
 https://textplain.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/image-7.png?w&#x3D;1024
 Background - I&#x27;m in charge of a unusual project to create a kiosk mode Windows 10 account for a multi-user government computer. Most of the users rely on their government issued &quot;PIV&quot; cards for authentication to log into various websites. Even though this is a multi-user computer, the users are handling sensitive HR forms and privacy is important. I&#x27;ve configured the kiosk mode as such. But the certificate prompt they see where they see former users&#x27; cards and names is a disaster and a privacy violation.
 Right now I have a script running in the task scheduler that clears the certificate cache every 24 hours. But it&#x27;s not a solution, just a workaround. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey,
 I have 2 different GPOs in this example, one is directly under the Domain - Global GPO - and one is burried down in an User OU - Custom GPO.
 In my Global GPO I have set the Setting &quot;Local Area Network (LAN) settings&quot; to yes. This Setting is located unter User Configuration - Preferences - Control Panel Settings - Internet Settings - Internet Explorer 10: Internet Explorer 10 - Connections.
 This Setting works just fine.
 Now in my Custom GPO I have set the Setting &quot;Local Area Network (LAN) settings&quot; to no, and it does not override my Global GPO. I even tried to set it to forced and it didn&#x27;t change anything.
 When I enter gpresult on an User affected by Custom GPO, it shows that the GPO is applied however, it shows Global GPO as the winning GPO.
 Am I missing something?
 edit: Global GPO is not set as enforced

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m new to whole sysadmin stuff. So the issue is nearly 10 servers of my institution went &quot;dead&quot; and not booting up at all. I have checked the GPUs and atleast one of them work, so its safe to assume that I can salvage the GPUs, but the technician said there is an issue with the Motherboard and that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t booting up anymore, no BIOS flash screen.
 I&#x27;m genuinely interested in re-using the hardware, there are atleast 40 GTX 1080Tis in there (each server has 4 GPUs in it.)
 The server racks were bought in 2016 when 1080Tis were a big deal. All of them are SuperMicro or Fujitsu systems.
 Any ideas what to do in order to reuse the compute power? The technician said the power supply is not manufactured of this model anymore, and the motherboards are hard to get, basically he is quoting for new purchase order altogether.
 Any ideas on how to proceed further?

                              <span>Hi,
 I was wondering how everyone else in here are managing their certs. Currently we have a wildcard cert and a few other certs as well as some self-signed certs internally.
  
 But lately we have considered getting a seperate certificate for each of our public facing services instead of using the same wildcard cert for services.
  
 I&#x27;m curious if this will be a pain to manage or if there is a nice tool for this. We are using Azure quite heavily and i see they have an SSL store, but i would idealy like something that could potentially autorenew the certificates.
  
 It seems like Keymanager Plus from ManageEngine can do something like that.
  
 How is everyone else managing it? Any software recommendations?

                              <span>Come tomorrow morning all managers will be made aware that staff must submit tickets to the help desk if they want IT help. No more banging on my door or &quot;paging&quot; me. I used to put in the tickets for the staff to record my time, but I&#x27;m not doing it anymore, because of the abuse. Friday I got pulled in all different directions all because a staff member didn&#x27;t realize a power adapter and outlet was not working and they had to keep their laptop charged. They literally didn&#x27;t understand the concept of charging a laptop. :D It was two hours of fighting with managers about getting up and &quot;fixing the problem,&quot; while I was in an unrelated meeting with my bosses.
 My two main questions are should I deactivate my personal extension? I don&#x27;t see the need for it really. I&#x27;m not really ever going to be answering it again. My team has my cell phone number and our slack channel. It will get in the way of the enforcement and the users will have the help desk main line that they can call. The only people who may need to call me is an outside vendor but I do have another number they can use.
 Also another question is, how does a user submit a ticket if they have no internet at their workstation? I am assuming that they tell their supervisor and they put in the ticket? How does it work for you guys?

Issue is related to time synchronisation and due to the queuing delays? Can anyone tell me what does these companies do to tackle this situation?

 I&#x27;m in the process of renewing my core networking. 
 Actually I&#x27;m evaluating 2x Juniper EX4400 or DELL S4148T .
 I can find a lot of information on the Juniper but I cannot find on reddit opinions on the DELL powerswitch 4100 series. 
 Does anyone have experience with these switches? What are your opinions about them?

                              <span>I found this recently to be causing lag failures in a number of locations and I can&#x27;t imagine why one would want to force 2 links if the lag contains 2 interfaces to begin with? It&#x27;s just a fatter SPOF at this point no? Isn&#x27;t the whole point of a lag redundancy + bandwidth? You&#x27;re chopping off the other purpose entirely and it&#x27;s preventing the lags from coming up anyway.
 These Junipers connect over to Cisco PE routers - is there some obscure compatibility issue I don&#x27;t know about?
 In writing this it seems settings them to a lower count and then back at least let&#x27;s them come up, still totally confused though.

                              <span>Newbie here. So i&#x27;ve got an opportunity to work &amp; impliment a network design for a small plant. Their existing design is that they are terminating all their ISPs in the Fortigate &amp; from there they are getting a LAN network (10.3.70.0/23 - Gateway:- 10.3.70.1) to an unmanaged switch. They have few servers on that switch &amp; from that switch they are giving uplink to other unmanaged access switches. My work here is to configure a Core switch(9300L) which will have VLANs for Data &amp; Voice &amp; will handle all the inter-vlan routing &amp; DHCP request as well as default route to the Gateway (FW). Easy, but the catch is that i can not touch the Fortigate firewall or change anything there. 
  
If i divide the /23 network into two /24 network, will there be any issue in the FW?
 
Is there any way that can i put the servers on Data vlan(10.3.70.0/24) without changing their subnet mask?
 
Can i terminate the LAN from the FW to Core in the Data vlan as an access port or is there a better way.
 
 If you have any good suggestions than feel free to let me know. 
 *Sorry for the lengthy post. Thank you.

                              <span>All hail the all powerful network admins!
 I, a lowly sysadmin, humbly beseech you for information on a Cisco issue I have been having. Please see fit to provide the information you may have to help me.
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with updating the firmware of 5 Cisco 9200L-48 switches in the education lab I&#x27;m in charge of. The firmware file I received worked fine on the first three, but the last two are saying that the calculated md5 hash doesn&#x27;t match the embedded md5 hash, and so they won&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ve tried with both 17.6.5 and 17.9.3. (I tried the 17.9.3 first, because it was what I was given, and after that didn&#x27;t work, I thought to ask for the 17.6.5 as an intermediate step.) I&#x27;ve tried multiple downloads of each, but keep getting the same error.
 Now, not being a habitual Cisco person, I&#x27;ve been using the web gui to do these updates. I am well aware more netadmins prefer to use the cli, but I am just not good at the Cisco cli, so I avoid it. If there is something in the cli that I can use rather than the web gui, I&#x27;m willing to try it. I just don&#x27;t know enough about the cli to know what to try right now. 
 As for going to my corporate net admins, they are overloaded, and don&#x27;t respond to tickets for months, so I can&#x27;t really do much there. I&#x27;d rather not uselessly add to their workload, with them in that situation. So, any help for me would be helping them.

                              <span>Purpose, trying to backup about 14TB of data from a server to 2 NAS&#x27;s. Server seems to max out @ 1Gbps.
 Recently, I added a 10Gbit SFP+ NIC into our Dell T430 server. Purchased 2 SFP+ MM Fiber 10Gbit fiber modules along with a 10Gbit MM fiber cable. Running a Unifi US-48-500W switch (Flow control/Jumbo Frames enabled). SFP+ Modules &amp; MM fiber cable go directly from server SPF+ Port to SFP+ Port on switch.
 Windows shows full 10Gbit connection (Verified in Device Management that &quot;Speed and Duplex&quot; are set to &quot;10Gbps Full Duplex&quot;) and Unifi Shows a 10Gbit connection in the console.
 We have 2 main NAS&#x27;s configured in 802.3ad LACP (One Synology DS416 and one WD EX4100 both with RAID 5 4x 8TB drives) Both show 2000Mbps connections.
 T430 has 8x 8TB Drives and when copying a file (Not through network) from RAID to SSD boot drive, achieves ~360MBytes. So I know the RAID is at least capable of those speeds.
 Copying files from RAID to either single NAS averages around 110MBytes. I understand that LAG does not increase transfer speeds for single client as it will just use one connection technically.
 However, when trying to transfer data from the server to both NAS&#x27;s, the Server NIC pegs out at 1GBit. Both NAS&#x27;s should be able to take at least 1Gbit each and the server should be putting out 2GBits total.
 Also tried copying one file from Server to NAS and copying another file from Server to Desktop PC at the same time. Originally transfers around 100MBps and as soon as the 2nd file transfer starts, the server file transfer speeds are split between the two to about 50MBps each.
 Thoughts/Idea&#x27;s anyone?

                              <span>Looking at perimeter firewalls for a small enterprise environment (600ish users). I know the Palo is gonna win on support, their UI looks a little cleaner, Wildfire seems like a great feature. Cost wise the Fortinet is miles cheaper and the throughput / total feature set is similar between the two. Looking at SD-WAN, a few IPsec tunnels, and will be peering to Azure and AWS.
 What would you recommend and why?

                              <span>yo,
 I&#x27;ve been looking into labels, specifically the bluetooth one, such as - niimbot, phomemo, brother cube,etc. And have just realised that most of them are shown to be printing black on white, and never the other way around. Are these thermal bluetooth label makers able to do it - print white on black, or does the printer have to have some special technology?
 Whichever it may be, please give me recommendations for good label printer/makers (that are able to print white on black ofc xd).

                              <span>Hi. I have been replacing some of our switches with Catalyst 9300 series. Overall, they are great. Today, I had 2 switches to configure. One of them doesn&#x27;t seem to support eem script. I fact, the &quot;event&quot; command doesn&#x27;t even exist in config terminal mode. The other works just fine. Both are running IOS-XE v17. Is there a special command to enable such feature? I know in NX-OS you have to explicitly enable some features via &quot;feature&quot; commands. Is it license dependent?! Google hasn&#x27;t been able to help me...

                              <span>I have 4 buildings each has there own subnet based off their school id.
 HS 10.2.x.x MS 10.3.x.x Elem 1 10.3.x.x Elem 2 10.4.x.x
 The previous director shared the vlans across each building. And on each core switch at the buildings is a vlan 128 interface with an IP helper. All core switches in each building are connected via a trunk port with all vlans passing. 
 Example vlan below:
 VLAN 128 - Employee WiFi Clients
 Interface vlan 128 on each core with a submet mask of 255.255.224.0 
 HS 10.1.128.1 MS 10.2.128.1 Elem 1 10.3.128.1 Elem 2 10.4.128.1
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is best practice but reading up on things seems it isn&#x27;t. I dunno, it works for us.
 Should I be doing things differently?

                              <span>Hi people,
 For a project I want to extend routing from the host into the VM. VMs run in KVM. So basically VM-&gt;Vm-Host-&gt;Leaf-&gt;Spine, and so on. 
 My first idea was to create a bridge, add the VMs interface and a dummy interface on the host to it and have a routing daemon run on both “sides”. On the host have routing between the dummy interface and physical interface setup. Repeat for each VM that runs on the host. But this doesnt sound like a very good design and is cumbersome, bc extra bridge for each VM. 
 Would that even work? What would be a better idea? 
 Cheers and thanks!

 Hi everyone! Has anyone tried using OMADA and tp link products for SCHOOL WIFI ZONE CAMPUS WIDE use? About 5000 concurrent users.
 Here&#x27;s the Plan: There will be 5 buildings and Im planning to use PTP to bridge the connection from Server room at the main building to the other 4 buildings. (Its a big campus and they do not allow cables to cross on each buildings). Then setup a wired AP (EAP610) per floor. Other APs will be configured as MESH per floor with the wired AP as their main AP. 
 Can you give me advice, feedback or recommendations with this setup? Thank you.

                              <span>What do you guys use to monitor routers, specifically Mikrotik activities? In my workplace they use PRTG which in my opinion is a bit ineffective. Like sure we can see the cpu usage and how much traffics are going in and out. But that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no logging whatsoever. I&#x27;m no expert in that field but ideally shouldn&#x27;t we have some logs about all the configurations in the router? Like when a user added an IP Address, a change in interface configuration, etc etc. Also details each traffics from each IP and VLAN should be logged to a certain extent no? The thing is, let&#x27;s say that there&#x27;s a 1 second spike in the traffic, but no one was paying attention at the time and only realized it few minutes later. Then we wouldn&#x27;t know what happened and from which IP or VLAN that spike came from. In Mikrotik there&#x27;s the &quot;Torch&quot; function to monitor real time traffic only for selected interface. But no logging at all which i think is really necessary.

 Greetings...
 I have a small question, I would like to know if I will be able to change the Serial on a Huawei GPON SFP Module by accessing the GUI or through TELNET?
 These are the 2 GPON Modules.

 Also considering just setting up the policies via local group policy since the user will not have admin.

                              <span>How do you usually figure out the infrastructure?
 I am put on a new project/product that has been acquired and the people who worked on it has just left with no documentation. I am now asked to figure out the bare bones of the infrastructure so it can be moved over to the main company. They are thinking of potentially recreating it, which is weird but they want the option in case. 
 They want me to get an inventory of what is in there and how much it costs.
 The infrastructure as I see it is in Azure.

                              <span>The below email was received from an outside organization. We are wanting to set this up for our company. Specifically in relation to guest accounts that are automatically created when documents from sharepoint are shared externally with guest users. However I am not clear on how this was setup within 365 and I can&#x27;t find documentation related to this specifically.
 I did locate Sharepoint setting: &quot;Guest access to a site or OneDrive will expire automatically after this many days&quot; - However based on what I read in the documentation, this is not the setting that has generated the below email notification.
 ​
 Are any of you aware on how to set this up? 
  
This is an automated email from &quot;Organization&quot; - your &quot;Organization&quot; guest account is about to expire.
  
This email address is registered as having &#x27;guest&#x27; access to some shared information or services with &quot;Organization&quot; systems. As this guest account access has not been used recently (almost 90 days) your account access is about to expire and be deleted.
 &quot;Organization&quot; Guest accounts must be used every 90 days to retain their active status. To renew your access - simply log into the &quot;Organization&quot; system to which this account was invited; or contact your &quot;Organization&quot; contact person.

 When playing around with the Hyper-V, I noticed that some Group Policies were accessed from the local computer. To be clear, we&#x27;re talking about GPMC, not GPEdit (or Local Policies). What I did on my Hyper-V, not on the DC but the PC which accesses GP on it, I installed some templates on it.
 Do the templates NEED to be installed on the DC or only the PC used to access the Group Policy Management Console? Would these policies, when abled, have any effect on the client PCs where the GP applies?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been impossible to buy a house in Vancouver (Canada) on a single income for a long time now, but now our condos have fallen into the same category.
 Can any sysadmins working in Texas speak to the quality of life down there? I&#x27;m thinking of relocating.
 The average rent for a 1 br apartment in Vancouver increased to $2,850 this year, and it just feels like we&#x27;re working hard for nothing, with no prospect of home ownership at the end of it.
 If I ever want to buy a 2 br home in Vancouver, this is what the market&#x27;s like. (And remember: all this in a city where the average income is $61,000. A lot of IT jobs here don&#x27;t pay significantly more than that.)

 What home labs can I do at home in order to help me reach my goal as a help desk and then level up over time to a sysadmin
 I know windows server is a great thing to learn but I want to know how to break it so that I can fix it
 I know that Azure is also a good thing to learn
 I found an opensource program that I can use for my own help desk and I can make a bash script that generates me random tickets for me to practice helping
 Any other tips or tricks. I am also still going for my A+

                              <span>Hi all, there were two domain controllers, DC1 and DC2. They are VMs. I found out that the previous system admin shut it down and remove DC2 without demoting it first. Then he built DC3 and left the company. DC2 is still in ADUC and not in DNS I am not able to remove it in ADUC. How do I completely remove DC2 in ADUC ??? Thank you.

                              <span>I have been using Windows10 and 11 Pro build USB sticks with Autounattend.xml file for a few years. Love it, works great. Nice and easy to get through the install with as little clicks as possible.
 However, new model of laptop came through, and it fails due to it not having drivers for the Intel Rapid Storage Driver. 
 So I had to rename the autounattend file (essentially deleting it), so I receive the prompt to install the drivers, insert additional usb with them on, and then get to installing - with all the damn clicks...
 Of course, now its not using the xml file at all...
 Is there a painless way to do this without rebuilding the world?

                              <span>SOLVED - WAS HARDWARE FAILURE (MULTIPLE SSD FAILURE AT ONCE)
  
Update - As unlikely as it seems, I think I suffered from multi SSD failure at the same time. Somehow it was hidden until the reboot, maybe windows was caching stuff in ram? Everything that died was on 3 different ssds. All the vms that still work are on different drives. 
 what are the chances of that?
 I&#x27;ve purchased new enterprise grade ssds, and have fixed the backup system. Now its time to recover the bits of the VMS that died and rebuild.
  
Update2 - I found some cool software and was able to recover everything except about 1.4G of data. That I have approx. 4 VHD files that wont boot, but with some work I can probably fix that. The rest are kind of working, but probably need some looking at. I&#x27;m not sure how 3 SSDs fail…</span>

                              <span>We demoted two Domain Controllers from a specific site in Active Directory Sites and Services, and then removed that site (also in AD Sites and Services). I still that removed site in DNS under _msdcs. (along with the two other remaining sites). The decom&#x27;d site shows up under &#x27;dc&#x27; and &#x27;gc&#x27; (under _sites). Looking at the _tcp folder for the removed site, I see an _ldap record that points to our FSMO DC that lives in our primary site. Is this typical behavior for removing a site? Did I miss a step? Do I just simply delete that _ldap record, and then delete the _sites folders under &#x27;dc&#x27; and &#x27;gc&#x27;? Or do I need to go back to &quot;AD Sites and Services&quot; and do something there to get it to update DNS correctly?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just after a bit of insight into how the company you work for offers training to its IT staff?
 I work for a large company in a 3rd Line role and have been with them for around 5 years. In that time I cannot remember any meaningful training that&#x27;s been offered to me either individually or as a team and its incredibly frustrating. We get the standard corporate crap like heavy lifting, gdpr, modern slavery, etc etc but no training for our roles.
 As an example, we&#x27;ve recently moved over to azure and although I have quite a lot of access within it, I have received zero training on it from the business. The access for the team gets less as you go down the levels e.g. 1st line and 2nd line have restricted access and can only do certain things like add someone to a group.
 We have a knowledge base but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best - we do try to keep it up to date though as much as possible. 
 What does your company offer you? If anything? Or do you just learn in your own time? 
 I&#x27;m interested to find out if anybody has time set aside for them to train e.g. Comptia courses, azure fundamentals - stuff like that. 
 I find I have to use my own time to train which I don&#x27;t think I should be doing.

 I am thinking of delving into linux FreeBSD* and focusing on Linux and FreeBSD for my core skillsets. I&#x27;ve heard that freebsd is more secure, like for example jails are a better isolation implementation than docker
 How true are these claims today in 2023, and Is it a good idea to get into FreeBSD putting the effort.
 If so what are some things to keep in mind.

                              <span>I have been dissecting pretty much every step of THIS MS Learn guide to build a custom and automated Windows 10 image to deploy on company laptops (they are HAADJ and manage with Intune)
 The one thing that I can&#x27;t get to work is adding Windows Updates to my image. I have tried:
  
apply updates offline (.msu from Windows Catalog) with DISM /Add-Packages
 offline install of same .msu updates in Audit Mode + sysprep + DISM image capture 
 run online Windows Update in Audit Mode + sysprep + DISM image capture 
  
In all these cases, after deploying the image on a real laptop, Cumulative Updates are not present in the list of installed updates and as soon as PC has Internet, Windows Update begins the download &amp; install process of both 06-2023 and 04-2023 Cumulative Updates. This slows the whole setup down and is driving me crazy. 
 Appreciate any idea on what I might be doing wrong here, thanks.

 Does anyone have any experiences going from a small IT team at a small/mid-size company to a huge company with like hundreds of IT staff, and in-house development, etc? How hard of an adjustment was it for you? What did you like most about going to a huge company? What did you dislike the most moving to a huge company? What about the interview process at a huge company vs a small company? 
 or maybe share an experience going in the opposite direction from a huge company to a very small company?

                              <span>Hi,
 I had this idea to secure more my server and wanted your advice:
 Imagine for example if:
 1- I configure Restricted ssh access to my server by IP Address
 /etc/hosts.allow 
 sshd,sshdfwd-X11: 192.168.2.111 192.168.2.101 
 /etc/hosts.deny 
 sshd,sshdfwd-X11:ALL
 2- I configure restricted wp-admin access in nginx conf
  
 location ~ ^/(wp-admin|wp-login\.php) {
 allow 1.2.3.4;
 deny all;
 } 
 If now there is a wordpress vunerability that allow the attacker to upload a shell backdoor to my website. will he still be able to modify files in website directories, gain access, ect... ? How usefull are restrictions like this ?

                              <span>Hello there! I recently got my hands on a Zebra ZD621T thermal printer, but unfortunately, it seems that the anti-static brush was bent during transportation. As a non-expert in this field, I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is something I should be concerned about. Could anyone provide some insights?

 I bought a wireless display adapter but needed type-c for power. The problem is my monitor doesn&#x27;t have any usb port. May I ask if it is possible to buy a display port to type-c adapter to connect the monitor and wireless display adapter for power?
 Thank you very much!

The issue is I have another drive which would’ve had the same password set at the beginning, but I don’t have a recovery key for it. Is there any way to view the password of the drive I have the recovery key for so that I can us it to access the other drive?

                              <span>Applied to a tier 2/sysadmin position at a small, local company on Tuesday. The staffing agency called me on Thursday, said the company was moving fast and scheduled me for yesterday morning. The initial interviewer liked my experience so much (despite fumbling some technical questions) that he asked the agency to schedule me for a second round interview in the afternoon with the president and CEO. They liked my experience and said how they wanted to hire quickly and asked me when I could start. It even turned slightly casual when they asked me about my hobbies.
 Is this a good sign? They&#x27;ll tell the agency after the 4th of July weekend.,

 I have followed this blog for a while, I love the fact we have a successful business resource saying what the technical teams already knew, the cloud isn&#x27;t cheap!
 From my point of view I am at the other end of the process with management coming along every 6 months or so saying why don&#x27;t we &quot;use the cloud&quot; - the general first response is why should we.
 When I run the numbers again and show it increasing our infrastructure costs by 250% they go away again for a few months. The one quantifiable I don&#x27;t include in figures is staffing to run the physical hardware, mainly because from experience outside of replacing hardware, our team going to server room is probably a once a month event. Running a VM in VMware doesn&#x27;t need more manpower than running on Aws. The fact the move back to on prem required no extra staff is a confirmation of this.

                              <span>Hi
 I was wondering if someone could help me with this. I am seeing a lot of alerts for the event ID 4625 - Account Failed To Log On. 
 Below is a example:
 An account failed to log on.
 Subject:
 Security ID: S-1-0-0 Account Name: - Account Domain: - Logon ID: 0x0 
 Logon Type: 3
 Account For Which Logon Failed:
 Security ID: S-1-0-0 Account Name: TomJones Account Domain: mydomain 
 Failure Information:
 Failure Reason: An Error occured during Logon. Status: 0xC00002EE Sub Status: 0x0 
 Process Information:
 Caller Process ID: 0x0 Caller Process Name: - 
 Network Information:
 Workstation Name: - Source Network Address: - Source Port: - 
 Detailed Authentication Information:
 Logon Process: Kerberos Authentication Package: Kerberos Transited Services: - Package Name (NTLM only): - Key Length: 0 
 We are seeing a large number of these events within our monitoring systems, which I believe may also be the cause of our current where multiple users are getting locked out randomly. 
 I have cleared cached passwords on the users machine ( credential manager), purged their KLIST, removed invalid passwords from their Edge browser which uses SSO, but still no change.
 I spoke to one user when the alert came through and they stated they had not been near their laptop. These events are network related as the logon type is 3.
 The status code indicates - STATUS_UNFINISHED_CONTEXT_DELETED
 A security context was deleted before the context was completed. This is considered a logon failure. 
 I am not sure what this means exactly.
 Has anyone come across something like this similar?
 Thanks

                              <span>Ladies and gents,
 I&#x27;m at somewhat of a cross road, I&#x27;m making as much as a generalist would make, or so I think. I&#x27;m looking for a career change for a few reasons, 1) moar money, duh. 2) WFH FTW!. 3)More options in the future.
 We&#x27;re all familiar with the dead end tech support, customer support positions so I&#x27;m not gonna go into that rant/vent here. As I&#x27;ve always learn by doing, I hardly have certificate/certifcations under my belt to show for what I can do.
 What I can do: recently got CCNA, CCNP is well within reason. LPIC-1 is probably low hanging fruit too, might strive for LPIC-2. Most recent dabbling with python &amp; powershell. Not a front end guy, but back end, bring it on.
 So, I&#x27;m going to hunker down and get certs to try and get myself another position. The way I see it, I can either go into product customer support, which would somewhat limit myself to my employer&#x27;s products, but that can be lucrative. Or go into DevOps/SRE/Data Analyst.
 Any advice on which to focus on, or something else I&#x27;m not aware of, and the path to it, that&#x27;ll be great. WFH is definitely a must for me, as I planned to WFH and move some place with lower cost of living before my current job which doesn&#x27;t allow WFH. If I can manage to double employ down the road, even better.
 So lay it on me, guys.

                              <span>We have over 20 TB of shared Drive storage, so I&#x27;m not worried about us running out any time soon, but he&#x27;s clearly just using it for the sake of it and it&#x27;s stupid.
 I heard from another student this guy was bored, so he uploaded a Windows ISO file (~4 GB) multiple times. We&#x27;re no way near our shared storage limit but it&#x27;s just annoying af.
 How would you handle this? Could go the formal reprimand route and tell him to stop wasting storage space but just wondering what would happen if I applied a storage quota once someone&#x27;s already over the limit?
 I had a look in the log files but it only seems to show the names and times uploads occur, rather than sizes of files.

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to colo my first server. It&#x27;s a Supermicro Superstorage 6028R-e1CR16T. Looking at the specs for the server, I have a concern about width.
 Width 17.2&quot; (437mm)
 Height
 3.5&quot; (89mm)
 Depth
 25.5&quot; (647mm)
 My colo facility says their racks are 48 U tall starting at 1 and have the industry standard 19” mounting width. Unless there is something I don&#x27;t understand, my servers 17.2 will not fit in side 19&quot; with rails right?

                              <span>I have recently been put in charge of an expanding project for my manufacturing company. We are adding a bunch of operation technology to the manufacturing floor and the problem I am running into is that the machines on the floor are using a standard IP scheme that is apparently not able to change at mass scale and the problem is, each manufacturing line uses around 40-50 &quot;IPs&quot; locally which I am not sure what they are but for example sake lets say they are 192.168.1.0/24 network. Now the IT Network is 10.5.1.0/25 per manufacturing area. Only one or two of the devices within the 40-50 devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet need to be able to export its data to the 10.5.1.0/25 subnet that contains a server collecting the data. How we have been currently doing that is one to one NAT&#x27;s with port level NAT&#x27;s using industrial DINN network switches. The problem I am trying to solve with this, is that this requires a switch per device since these switches we are using only have 2 or 4 ports on. One port for the 192.168.1.0 IP and one for the IT Routable subnet. What I am wanting is either a fix to this without re-IPing the machines but a more central device that can handle the NAT&#x27;s. I am thinking a 48 port switch that I can basically NAT the machine IP&#x27;s in mass? Anyone got Ideas? If I am completely missing an easy solution please no hate.
 ​
 EDIT:: So the IE-2000, Could I implement that back at the Network cabinet and terminate all of the devices needing connected to it then have one uplink port to the OT Network and configure L2NAT instances for each interface?

                              <span>Earlier post asking about V6 adoption. Dinosaur here, recollecting that the big issue for adoption late-90s early 2000s was that the design/policy was that enterprise V6 allocations were only from an ISP, there would be no Provider-Independent allocations. (I think this was because v4 routing tables were outpacing router memory at the time. Having ISP allocation allowed greater summarization) Naturally there was a storm every time this policy was brought up on NANOG. If one wanted to have more than one upstream for resiliency, there would be two entirely separate V6 address spaces. So a complex protocol came out of the Network Working Group: RFC 5533, Shim-6: Multi-homing Shim Protocol. When the policy was inevitably changed to PI allocations I felt so sorry for the folks who must have spent many meetings working out the Shim Protocol. PI address space allocation was the beginning of the long adoption process.

                              <span>I posted this before, but I&#x27;m realizing I needed to give a lot more details.
 I&#x27;m working for a company that has oil wells spread across several thousand acres of land. We are looking into the feasibility of a multiyear effort to fit all of the wells with various kinds of sensors and detectors, which will give us maintenance data a lot faster.
 I&#x27;m just posting here to get a general sense of the options that are out there. We will hire a network consultant at some point down the line, but for now I&#x27;m just putting together a presentation for the higher ups about this potential project, and I wanted to be able to add additional details about the technologies we would use and perhaps a very rough budget.
 I really don&#x27;t know much about networking, so I apologize is advance for any dumb questi…</span>

 Couple questions, im new in my first line tech job so i might not be able to answer all your questions.
 When it starts up the switch sounds like its taking off to space for like 15 seconds then chills. thats normal right? 
 im trying to reset the thing. thats it. Putty isnt working. I have the correct settings. the cable im using is a RJ45 to usb . its in the correct port in the back (i think) IoIoI port. and it boots to a black screen. Would be a massive help if someone could send me over advice and ill look at this tomorrow as i have been swearing at this switch for about a hour and looking things up and i NEED SLEEP xD 
 Thank you guys so much in advance.

 I know the usual names Tenable, Qualys, Tripwire, but which tools are especially suited to network devices? Something along the lines of Solarwinds, but what are the options besides Solarwinds?

                              <span>I know this kind of question requires a crystal ball that nobody has, but what are your best guesses/predictions about when IPv6 adoption is going to kick into full gear?
 Im in my late 20s, I intend to work in/around networking for the rest of my career, so that leaves me with around 30 more years in this industry. From a selfish point of view, I hope we just keep using IPv4.
 But if I’m not wrong, Asia is using more and more IPv6 so that leaves me wondering if I’m 5/10 years, IPv6 will overtake IPv4.

                              <span>Hello we will be upgrading our DC access layer switches running cumulus 3.7 to 4.1 . They are in an mlag configuration with servers dual connected to both switches. The switches have l3 links up to the spines. We want to guarantee the upgrades go as smooth as possible with no traffic loss. 
 Wondering if someone that has done this has any tips they would like to share
 What we are planning to execute is the following 
 Drain l3 traffic ( bgp as path prepend advertisement the spines)
 Shutdown all host facing ports and uplink s
 Stop / disable clagd
 Shutdown peer link 
 Perform upgrade
 Bring up peer link 
 Enable / start clagd 
 Remove as path prepend 
 Bring up ports ( at this point nvidia said ports will only be single connected because they switches will be running different version) 
 Switch roles make primary secondary 
 Then do the same steps.

 When I use ldapsearch via terminal i&#x27;m getting a base64 encoded string from the query for &quot;usercertificate;binary&quot; which I can convert to binary to toss up into my own AD.

 I&#x27;m trying to either:
 1) Download usercertificate;binary and be able to reupload it into my internal AD
 2) convert what I&#x27;m getting into something you can import up into AD, such as a straight binary value or something else.
 I&#x27;ve only dabbled in python with other projects so getting into the deepend with this. I suppose I could also just do a sys call against ldapsearch to get the value I want but figured there has to be a way to do this in python itself.

                              <span>Hey guys! First time posting here, I hope it’s not a duplicate.
 I’ve been desperately trying to figure out a solution to this issue that was assigned to me by my senior team member, thus leading me here.
 We have two Synology NAS (DS920+), each loaded with 14TBx4 disks. The first one is used as main storage, we got the same one to expand our storage, and I figured it’s easier from a client’s pov to have both NASes joined together as a whole storage.
 What i came up with was mount both nfs shares on a VM, unify them with mergerfs and then re-export from VM. It worked but as my senior team member said it’s a single point of failure, therefore I duplicated the VM then spawned another one as a load balancer (HAProxy), but in the end it did not work as NFS refused to mount the LB IP.
 I want to know if it’s possible to unify them under a shared volume or one NFS export.
 I heard about Ganesha and gluster fs but I did not find anything or anyone using it for a similar use case of mine.
 Does anyone have an idea how to scale out nas synology? I’m somewhat desperate and any help is highly appreciated

                              <span>We had a bad switch that started spewing malformed broadcasts onto the subnet at a satellite office. No big deal. It was older, so we replaced it. I configured it based on the configuration of the switch that went bad. I could have swore it was a /23 network.
 This, of course, was a weekend, and come Monday we had endpoints with “stuck” IP addresses that refused to renew, and weird SIP problems where calls went through without problem, but conversations were suddenly muted. I suspected a NAT problem so I went on the hunt. Two days later I still found nothing and felt defeated.
 So, there are a number of issues that lead to this, many of which “existed before me”, but I’m here now and the bottom line is it was my fault. The big boss figured it out and all I could do was slap myself on the forehead. It was originally a /24 network. We reconfigured the PBX and all downstream appliances to use a /23 space. Within 10 minutes all was well.
 Lesson learned was always verify the IP space you are working in. I could have saved myself a lot of time, frustration and embarrassment.
 BTW: I know this is more netadmin stuff. Like many of us my sysadmin duties really run the gamut. So I thought I’d share the lesson here.

                              <span>I have seen the earlier posts regarding DCU but they stop short of some detailed info that would be helpful. 
 What I am thinking is:
  
Use TDM (Tech Direct Dell) to create driver packages, BIOS, tools, etc. That allows me to download a Zip file
 Put the unzipped BIOS files (for example) on the source directory of the SCCM MP. 
 Replicate these folders/files to the DP&#x27;s (using Package\Program)
 Run a command which copies these folders to the local machine (say, C:\Source)
 run the DCU-CLI with appropriate switches to install the updates from the Source folder
 Setup the ADMX Template to turn off Dell.com as a source
  
​
 When thinking a bit further, these drivers, etc are many Gigs of data and will fill things up if I do this repetitively without deleting them periodically.
 This model may not make the best sense, and alternatively I could have the computers run the DCU-CLI and point it to the DP&#x27;s to get the updates. 
 Ideas? Suggestions?
 I&#x27;ve been playing with the switches to try this using just a \\server\share and have not been able to use the UNC path appropriately (not certain which switch specifies the \\server\share), but more problematic is how to have computers in a remote site point to the local DP to scan and apply. 
 Has anyone done it this way? thanks!

 I think we are hitting the 10 year mark soon of our R630s, we hae 4 hour onsite support that expired two years ago but have never needed a call out, one server has a single 16gb ram stick fail but thats it.
 is there any benefit to replacing soon or should i replace when one fails?

 My question is, on the office sign in page, they can still select &quot;enter password instead&quot;. Can that be removed? They don&#x27;t have a password so it&#x27;s pointless and just complicates things.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to make a career change into IT and am currently learning about Active Directory and creating my own. With VirtualBox I created a virtual machine and installed Windows Server 2019 to use as my domain controller. I promoted it to a domain controller and added the AD tools and everything seems fine. 
 With another virtual machine I installed Windows 10 to connect to the domain controller. Everytime I try to connect to the domain I get the error: An Active Directory Domain Controller for the domain could not be contacted. 
  
The domain name is correct and being spelled correctly. 
 I&#x27;ve made sure to change the Windows 10 computer DNS to the IP address of the DC. 
 Both computers are able to ping each other successfully with both IP Addresses and computer names.
 I&#x27;ve disabled the firewall on each computer to ensure certain traffic isn&#x27;t being blocked.
  
After all of this I&#x27;m still getting the same error. Can someone point me in the right direction to what I may be missing?

                              <span>So, our engineers have been tasked with setting up a 12 server (Windows 2019 Server) environment to run software for a manufacturing plant. These were likely member servers that were dis-joined from their domain and placed within their own domain. One of the tasks I was given was to harden the security via GPOs. 
 The second I popped into Group Policy Editor, I was greated with a warning that was something to the effect that it couldn&#x27;t sync (I forgot exactly what it was when I looked at it yesterday). It does appear that it retained some of the previous policies from the previous domain. I created some of the policies like not allowing anonoymous logins and basic objects of that sort, but some of them lost out on the winning GPO that was in place. I deleted a few of them, but they are sticking on the other servers creating issues with service accounts that the software needs to run. I even tried writing new policies to reverse them, but am still having issues with them sticking. 
 I know the proper thing to do would be to rebuild the entire domain, but we don&#x27;t have the time frame given to us to complete. I&#x27;m probably just overthinking this, but is there a way to rip everything out and redo all of the policies? TIA!!!

                              <span>Our environment has 5 hosts, two of which are out of support, a Dell R620 and two R630&#x27;s along with two R740xd&#x27;s that are still supported until late 2025. Our storage arrays are a Dell VNXe 3200 which is long out of support and a Unity 300 and HPE Nimble that are going up next year. My original thought was to replace all of it with a new HCI cluster but there is a fear that it&#x27;s &quot;too much&quot; for our environment of about 40 VMs. As a result, I&#x27;ve been asked to look into a traditional SAN solution to replace it instead. 
 Considering what we have, the most cost-effective option would seem to replacing all 3 storage arrays with 2 new storage arrays, keeping the R740xd&#x27;s while dropping the 3 other hosts, and adding in one new host. It would be the minimum amount of hardware to replace and while it kicks the can down the road on our remaining hosts, we&#x27;d have over two years before they need to be replaced.
 Any thoughts or other suggestions that I may be overlooking?

                              <span>This week i&#x27;ve had a very long argument with our sysadmin over devops (and fundamentally how computers work). Everyone I know in my life is not in IT, so I thought I would talk here as I really need some feedback on this. 
 Put your seatbelts on cause we are boarding the shitshow-express.
 I (fullstack web dev) have proposed to develop an in-house tool using a Flask API and Vue.js frontend as our SAP tools weren&#x27;t cut out for the job (company never did development, but they recognize the utility in a developer so they hired me to improve UI development). My sysadmin has insisted on me deploying it on a Windows machine because &quot;that&#x27;s what we are comfortable with&quot;. Begrudgingly I agreed and asked him if I will be given SSH access. Then following occurred:
  
Syso: &quot;It&#x27;s not secure. You can&#x27;…</span>

( The actual IPs are different. ) Security guy found out recenty that 192.168.1.30 tried to connect to 1.168.1.31. He says that 1.168.1.31 is an IP in China. I initially thought that it was 192.168.1.31. He showed me the log..it showed 1.168.1.31. Did anyone have similar issue before? Thank you.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We&#x27;re all familiar with the warning message we receive when accessing a new server via SSH, indicating that the server&#x27;s hash isn&#x27;t in our known_hosts file. We&#x27;re prompted to type &quot;yes&quot; to confirm access, and once we do, the warning doesn&#x27;t show up again for that server.
 I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone has ever found this warning to be genuinely helpful in their sysadmin career. Has it ever prevented you from connecting to a fake server? In my experience, I always end up typing &quot;yes&quot; when I see this message, even when a server has been rebuilt and its hash has changed. This makes me wonder if the warning is as useful as it&#x27;s intended to be.
 Please share your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Thanks!

Which asset tracking/management software would you recommend so that they can move away from tracking everything with paper and pen?

                              <span>So our remote users(VPN) have been plagued with strange VOIP problems like loss of audio or choppy audio caused by packet drops for over a month now(The issue is affecting more than just VOIP but VOIP is the most noticeable). We had our providers on calls all day long doing traces to find the issue with no success so far ... Until we came across a comment way low in a BleepingComputer article.
 The comment mentions that enabling the Windows service &quot;Routing and remote access&quot; helped them fix a similar issue.
 We were skeptical as this is usually used on a server and not on workstations, but we tried it anyway and... Well damn... It actually works. All packet drops stopped.
 We are currently working with Microsoft and our VPN provider to identify what the service changes in Windows that affect this issue.
 If you are having strange stability and packet drops on VPN, give that a try maybe.
 Disclamer: I do not know all consequences of enabling this service yet. Use at your own discretion and risk.

 I&#x27;m just having a think just now but this sub is way better than anywhere else for getting a diverse set of opinions.
 Its likely to be 6-10 users needing central user administration and file share management. They are a non profit startup so on a shoestring. As ever I do it stuff so got asked even though been years since I looked at AD. I&#x27;ll likely ask one of my network with recent experience to volunteer here but would be good to know what&#x27;s out there.

                              <span>I mean seriously! I&#x27;ve worked with so many guys that refuse to log support calls unless I badger them for weeks about it.
 Have an issue you can&#x27;t fix straight away?Log the bloody call! You can still work on the issue but if it&#x27;s a bug or a known issue the vendor will know and get it fixed faster.
 Supports costs $10,000s / year &amp; yet some sysadmins take it as a personal insult. Even issues that are urgent and they&#x27;re still working on a week later while users are screaming......oh we&#x27;re still looking into it........LOG THE FUCKING CALL!!! 
 Or even if I want a design answer.....what&#x27;s the packet flow of this software, how does it work and where do the packets go? Oh I&#x27;ll Google that.....weeks later...oh yeah I couldn&#x27;t find anything.....log a fucking call with the vendor!!!!!

                              <span>Hi,
 I was wondering what everyones offboarding procedure is. We are running on-prem AD synced to Azure with AD connect. Moving towards making the on-prem ad redundant. But it takes time and it&#x27;s still used for servers and a bunch of legacy stuff. Either way our offboarding procedure is just weird to me. It works, bjt we have a tonne of disabled users and the number only grows. 
 Currently our procedure is as follows:
  
 Right away:
  
User is disabled disabled
 
Password is reset reset
 
user is removed from all groups (effectivly removing licences as this is applied using groups)
 
user is added to a single group that gives them an exchange online plan 1 license license
 
user is converted to a shared mailbox
 
 -1 other user gets access to their mailbox and 1 forward is made. To the same user or another user( chosen by the manager)
  
 After 2 months:
  
add old_ prefix to users mail address and UPN UPN
 
remove delegation and forward
 
  
 Now i guess my question is, at what point do we just delete the user account? Security are worried that deleting a user will also remove them from our sentinel and other logs. Or at least make it harder to trace the logs. But at some point i think that this is irrelevant. Nobody investigates 12months + old logs?
 How do ylu habdle offboarding?

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m a syadmin at a manufacturing company of about 900 workers and I deal with different types of tasks which go from diagnosing simple support issues up to migrating on prem telephony to teams telephony. I feel like I am technically pretty good but I find myself having tasks or tickets being open for weeks because I can&#x27;t distribute my time on them efficiently. I often spent several days focused on a task and the others get procrastinated on. I feel I could work straight for weeks and never run out of work and I can never shake off the feeling that I&#x27;m not being efficient. My question is, how do you guys manage your time so that there is a healthy balance between your tasks and avoid constantly pushing the &quot;smaller stuff&quot; for later? Should I get into some project managing courses or something?

                              <span>I&#x27;m the sole IT support at a small private school with &lt;50 staff. I deployed a Debian CUPS server for the teachers&#x27; printers so they can print wirelessly instead of the old-fashioned way of bringing over their laptops to plug the USB printers in, and has worked mostly fine.
 New teacher comes in with only an iPad, and any attempt to get AirPrint in CUPS to work has been naught, always returning &quot;You do not have permission to use this printer&quot;. Already spent a couple of days poring through articles online to setting up AirPrint/Bonjour through Avahi, no dice. Avahi is not listening on port 5353 either, and any attempt to print through the iPad or macOS has run into the same authentication error.
 Any ideas on what I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m making my first attempt at setting up FOG Server to deploy images for 4 different Windows 11 buildouts that will need to go onto mix of desktops and laptops. I&#x27;ve been able to get all the way through registering an image, but I&#x27;m stuck at deployment. I&#x27;m still trying to figure this thing out, and I feel like I&#x27;m missing something simple.
 I&#x27;m using VirtualBox to create the VMs for the FOG host, FOG server, and the Windows 11 golden image. The FOG host is Ubuntu Server 22.04, FOG Server is version 1.5.10. DHCP is set to the FOG Server IP in 066, and I have 067 set to snponly.efi. On the golden image, I have generic apps (Chrome, Everything, VLC Player, Office365,) as well as larger installs for SolidEdge and AutoCAD Viewer. I went through sysprep and created an answer file for unattended installation for UEFI, and have a volume license key as well, so I&#x27;m covered there. I then was able to successfully register and then capture the image in FOG.
 ​
 Where I&#x27;m stuck: I&#x27;ve tried deploying this on a physical desktop as well as a VM, and this is as far as I get:
 Filename: snponly.efi
 thtp://10.xx.xx.xx/snponly.efi... ok
 snponly.efi : 274944 bytes [PXE-NBP (may be EFI?)]
 Nothing happens beyond that point. I&#x27;ve tried using ipxe.efi as the boot file, and I get the error could not boot image: exec format error. I feel like this is something simple that I&#x27;m overlooking. 
 Any help and/or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I do pro bono work for a nonprofit organization. They called me on Wednesday morning and informed me that some websites were not working for all users. Additionally, Outlook had issues. Upon investigation, I discovered that major websites like YouTube and Facebook were displaying SSL certificate errors. In the Chrome web console, I noticed recurring reconnection errors. The organization mentioned that they had recently upgraded their Comcast connection and were told that their modem was outdated. Consequently, I advised them to contact Comcast and request a replacement. A technician replaced the modem, tested it, and confirmed that all sites were functioning properly on his PC.
 However, when I reevaluated the situation tonight, I discovered that connecting a PC directly to the modem resulted in the same issue. Changing the DNS settings did not resolve the problem. After spending two hours troubleshooting, I found a temporary fix by enabling DNS over HTTPS, which resolved the issue for everything except Outlook.
 I am aware that this is not a long-term solution. Based on my best guess, this appears to be an issue with Comcast. However, persuading them to acknowledge and address the problem may prove challenging since they rely on the Comcast modem for DNS and DHCP services. Since not all devices support DNS over HTTPS, I need to find an alternative solution.

                              <span>Hi All
 I have been in corporate world in same company for over decade. It was my first corp job and it took few years to establish the 3rd (corp face) when dealing with users and co-workers. 
 Normally I can shrug things off like duck in water but lately we had some close to home lay offs affecting my team and more responsibilities added on. I am feeling distressed due to that fact and can not be emotionless drone with fake feelings about anything anymore. 
 I am asking for the best way to realign my mood and stop caring about the job more then needed. It is hard for me to stop caring or have go to attitude. 
 If I should post this somewhere else please let me know. Thank you and enjoy your 4th

                              <span>Hi All Not really a rant not sure how to say it correctly. My manager is always eager to say where I need to improve on but whenever something good happens I only know via 3rd party. Meaning my manager will praise me to others and upper management but not directly to me. 
 So most of the time I only hear criticism directly but success via another department manager or co-worker. 
 Am i whining or is there miscommunication of some sort?

                              <span>Was getting ready to order another NAS and my vendor told me that Intel killed Optane? I knew they did that to the consumer grade products but was not prepared for enterprise. What is everyone using now? 60 DWPD makes it perfect for the ZIL on a large ZFS NAS or any other abusive/critical services or applications.

                              <span>Not my primary account.. DUH
 OK, I just got a job, they paid my moving expenses and I started 3 weeks ago.
 In those 3 weeks, 2 weeks of time entries have been changed from around 52 hrs down to 32 &amp; 40 since we are on 9/80 work weeks with every other Friday off. Looks like they missed a week.
 US law applies, so my understanding is that you must submit accurate timesheets regardless of whether you are in a salaried position or not. This has not affected my 2 paychecks so far, but I am concerned about my future reviews and promotions since my work is not being accurately shown.
 I&#x27;m coming to you guys for advice on how to proceed, I am a very direct and confrontational individual and do not want to start off on a bad foot, but feel this is very wrong. I have checked with my immediate supervisor who got a BS answer from HR about payroll only being used to bill vendors. And I have checked with 2 others on my team and their timesheets are correct and accurately reflect their 50 hour weeks, so I am at a loss.
 Thanks guys, I know some great advice is coming my way..
 EDIT: Some of you just really don&#x27;t understand..
 I am being told to lie about the number of hours I work. This is not acceptable period. Not to mention against the law and probably in violation of SOX. 
 With no official record of my time, if something were to happen I have no recourse.
 NM state law is very clear on this matter:
 50-4-9. Records, subpoenas, etc.
 A. Every employer shall keep a true and accurate record of hours worked and wages paid to each employee. The employer shall keep such records on file for at least one year after the entry of the record.

                              <span>I worked 2nd line support for 3 years at my current company. Left for a consultancy gig but one year in an opening appeared for an MS 365 engineer at my precious company. I thought &#x27;hey fuck it, I&#x27;ll just apply to see where I&#x27;m at and learn what I am lacking.&#x27;
 To my surprise I got the job. I&#x27;m now part of the team that I used to escalate things to and ask for help. Awesome. But my teammates all have decades of experience more than me and it shows in meetings. When we go over stuff that we did the past week and have in the agenda, I always feel like it&#x27;s the equivalent of them saying &#x27;I&#x27;ve updated VMware tools, migrated x from our data center to y, configured our Cisco Firepower to do this and that&#x27; and then there&#x27;s me saying &#x27;I deployed my first Autopilot pc.&#x27;
 They knew about my experience, they know what I&#x27;m capable of but I feel like a massive loser in my team. I&#x27;m trying my hardest to gain experience by shadowing them, doing self study about Intune and our whole cloud environment but fuck me, I feel like a junior first line guy all over again.
 I know I&#x27;m not technically a sysadmin but I feel like/hope that some people in here know what I&#x27;m talking about and how to cope.
 Sorry about the rant, I learned so much from you guys on a technical level. Maybe I can get some mental advice too.

 I&#x27;ll start by saying that I work for an MSP that supported our local airport for some specific parts of their infrastructure (we don&#x27;t anymore, thankfully) and one thing I can say is that their servers used for baggage sorting is running on super old citrix machines running Server 2003 OS, and there was no sign that they would upgrade anytime soon. But hey, at least their corporative servers were on Server 2019.
 I&#x27;m interested in some of your stories about just how outdated is infrastructure that we&#x27;re all so reliant on.

                              <span>This is an old vulnerability in exchange online mailboxes. I have noticed that it has been pretty constant with how often we are targeted at my work. I have &quot;User impersonation protection&quot; turned on, which is catching everything that I am aware of. It is a little worrying that this is the only feature holding these messages back. Does anyone have any good recommendations to mitigate this?

                              <span>If you look at the CQURE Hacks 39 video on YouTube, it shows a quick demo of how easy it is to use pass-the-PRT to steal Azure PRT tokens even on a fully patched Windows system with Credential Guard enabled and TPM protections.
 The attack requires local admin access, but that isn&#x27;t an insurmountable obstacle.
 Even if the local user doesn&#x27;t have admin privileges, there are constantly application flaws, driver flaws and OS flaws that can be exploited to allow privilege escalation that would give the attacker local admin rights. Then there is just plain malware and zero day flaws between updates to do this if the attacker gets on a perfectly patched system. Users can be tricked into clicking on malicious links and opening files with malware and there is even occasional malware that requires no user interaction (Malvertisements and Outlook flaws that allow malware to run without even opening the message).
 You can have A/V and EDR to detect and block tools like Mimikatz, but Mimikatz does not need to run locally on the system. In the video, the data is copied to a different system with Mimikatz installed. No hacking tools need to be installed on the system being attacked.
 Besides all that can be done with the local user&#x27;s Azure credentials to send spam and phishing emails and exfiltrate data, if any device admins had entered their credentials into the system (UAC prompt etc.) to assist the user within the last 14 days, their active PRT will also be on the machine and that would give the attacker access to everything the device admin has access to in the tenant.
 This type of attack gets around credential guard and TPM protections and then bypasses all forms of MFA and passwordless authentication (FIDO2 security keys etc.). So, what protection exists to prevent this?

                              <span>My org introduced No Meeting Fridays. So naturally, PMs still booked 6 hours worth of meetings today. FML.
 Edit: Org issued update that said No Meeting Fridays doesn&#x27;t mean no meetings on Fridays, or that you can decline/not attend meetings. Useless.

 Looking for insight - does using SSLVPN with RSATokens as the MFA method more or less secure than TOTP via any of the major Authenticator apps?

                              <span>Hey folks! Bit of an odd question/thought exercise, but figured I&#x27;d ask and see if you all have any thoughts/ideas.
 In Linux, you can use PAM (more specifically, pam_ssh_agent_auth) to authenticate to a machine through the use of an SSH agent, thus bypassing the need for a password. Is there anything like it for Windows, i.e. something which would allow you to authenticate/log-in to a computer upon startup - either bypassing or being used in conjunction with a password or other Windows Hello auth method? 
 Without going into too much detail, I&#x27;ve got a working agent, and USB device which stores/generates a pub/priv key pair. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve managed to make an SSH connection to my machine, from my machine. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there r/sysadmin ! So I created a local account from my main admin account so that a friend could log in as a guest but when I tried logging back to my main account, I couldn&#x27;t find it. I tried, to no avail : 
  
Troubleshooting at startup : after I click troubleshoot/advanced options, all the available options such as boot in safe mode or command prompt are unavailable and I get the message: &quot;You need to sign in as an Administrator to continue, but there aren&#x27;t any administrator accounts on this PC.&quot;
 
Open an elevated command prompt: when I try to run cmd as admin, it prompts me to sign in as admin. In &quot;other options&quot; here it is, my old admin account appears. I enter the pin but it says invalid credentials and prompts me to try again. 
 
 The account still exists in C:/Users.
 I would be immensely grateful for any help on the matter.
 Cheers,

Network team has been going back and forth with our provider regarding this. My director asked me to confirm if the proxy servers for our backup jobs may be having an effect on the fluctuating speeds. So he wants me find out how much traffic the proxies are generating. But I’m not sure how to do that. Any ideas?

                              <span>Here is the scenario. My wife is a school teacher at a new school. To visualize her new classroom, imagine a square with the white board and smart projector installed on the front wall. 
 The back wall is cabinets and counter tops from one side to the other. Also on the back wall and above the countertops, is the ethernet port for her computer, printer, and the phone line for her classroom phone. The pervious teacher was clearly using the countertop as her desk, which kept her back to the kids, forced her to sit on a stool, and block some cabinets with her desk. 
 Ideally, my wife would like to have her computer/desk at the front of the room, so that she can face her students while at her desk. This would require 30 foot of cords to cross the room. Is there some way to have her computer at the front of the room, without cords, and still be plugged in to the ethernet? 
 Any help or advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>I’m a junior sysadmin in charge of a small network that services 300+ users. The network/domain infrastructure was built by a contracting company and I swear it was designed to be broken from day one. There are 50+ virtualized servers to manage and I barely know anything about them because I came here two years after the installation and the previous sysadmins were hotshots that only applied bandaid fixes so they couldn’t tell me anything of value. The only people that saw how it ran as intended are long gone and I’m stuck piecing together whatever I can with my limited experience. Getting information out of the contracting company is next to impossible because I have to fight my way through their help desk that of course only answer to emails. And even then they are intentionally vague in order to bait my company to pay extra to go fly over to fix whatever’s wrong. I might as well not even be here. The contractors were supposed to build the network then hire junior techs to maintain it but how am I supposed to maintain anything when it’s all hidden behind a contract. I have full access to the network. Im not just a user with limited access. Yet I feel like im running into a new major issue every week and nothing is ever a quick fix or even something I’ve dealt with before. It almost feels like it was engineered to be complicated and they convinced their clients to hire under qualified techs so they can get more money to fly out and be the “subject matter experts”. I’m so sick and tired of this, it’s actually killed my desire to continue working in this field because I’m being set up left and right by these greedy fucks.

                              <span>I am using windows 11 Intel celeron n5100 I use multiple terminals like windows powershell, git bash, mobaxterm etc. The terminals work normally and smooth when I use locally but when I ssh into my cloud server the commands are responding very slow. The server metrics are fine. Just the commands are slow to respond. I confirmed that it&#x27;s not my server problem by ssh into my cloud server on my another PC which just works like a charm. Why I am I experiencing this and how to resolve this?

 I&#x27;m an IT manager/sysadmin, in charge of a small team for a company of over 200. When it comes to &quot;IT&quot; people, I&#x27;m the top of the organization. My boss is a person who is sort of a catchall for departments that don&#x27;t have a home. They lead a bunch of random &quot;teams&quot; and have no real knowledge or interest in IT at all.
 In previous roles I&#x27;ve had at minimum an IT Director above me who could advocate for IT in the strategy of the organization, even if they weren&#x27;t assisting or super knowledgeable about the tech itself. I&#x27;ve found that without that, IT is very much pushed off to the side and viewed as a bother. Even when we&#x27;re doing projects that are genuinely to assist the staff, no one is taking that up the chain to get buy in from the higher ups.
 Anyone else in a position like this?

                              <span>I have a Dell T630 w/ the redundant SD cards for VMWare. The SD1 card has failed and I need to rebuild the array. In researching this I found these instructions which have a blurb stating &quot;NOTE The rebuild is always sourced from the primary SD card to the secondary SD card.&quot; I have also read on blogs/etc that you just put a new card in the old cards slot and let it rebuild on boot. 
 For anyone that has rebuilt an IDSDM array on an older Dell server running iDRAC 8. Do I need to move the good SD2 card to the SD1 slot, put a replacement card in SD2 and then rebuild -or- can I simply replace SD1 and rebuild?
 ​
 Also, this is my homelab, I know that VMWare on SDCard is not best practice I don&#x27;t need this to devolve into that. I just need to rebuild the array correctly.

My understanding from my 5 minutes of research is every building run should have a circuit id associate with it and with comcast, it probably has CBCL somewhere in its name. I know nothing beyond that, and customer service doesn&#x27;t know what a circuit ID is trying to tell me its the wifi SSID when I bring up the CBCL in their format.
 Just trying to document it and fill out everything I can. We would have one right, even if we are just a small business with 1 location, 6 employees on a standard 50mb line.

                              <span>Hello
 I need to prevent a remote desktop session from going into idle. The setting to not logout/disconnect user was already made, but still if I let the window, minimize and work on something else, it shows as idle:
 in cmd: query user /server: MY_SERVER, shows idle after 1 minute of inactivity
 I need to have this active all the time, as a user makes some activity, since I have some scheduled tasks that will run some GUI actions/applications. Also the remote connection will at some point start by itself, if the server gets rebooted or so.
 What I have tried:
 - mouse jiggler
 - caffeine
 - autohotkey scripts (click and pressing keys)
 - powertoys - awake
 -vbs, powershell scripts
 None of them worked. The cmd query still showed idle after one 1 minute
 Am I missing something? Does this have to do with windows being opened (not minimized), or having focus or something else? Is there any tricky thing regarding how windows detects inactivity
 If I have the window not minimized, and something is running (like a mouse jiggler or something) then, the connection is not being shown as idle at all
 Thank you
 ​
 P.S. Hopefully I did not put this into the wrong category. But I did not found one for the remote desktop connection

 But I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m taking it a bit to far and not pulling my weight, upholding my obligations. My team isn&#x27;t to bothered by this because they know I do my work when I&#x27;m asked but I don&#x27;t want to become a lazy lard and let it become an issue (could be thinking to much into it).
 Like I said, I&#x27;m not coming back cold turkey. I&#x27;ve been working, but not up to my own standards. (I&#x27;m grateful my team let me do this because I was under stress but I want to get back to help them on more complicated matters like deploying VDI, and a new virtualization stack at another office).
 ​
 Any advice for someone who wants to get back into the saddle and start being more productive?
 [sorry if this isn&#x27;t the right flair, I can fix it if someone tells me what this actually belongs under]

                              <span>was thinking about Cloudflare unfortunately prices are too high. all these sites are getting small traffic. (less than 20GB daily for all sites). many sites are installed Let&#x27;s encrypt SSL certificates. so the solution should capable of SSL offloading + scan (IDS, IPS, anti-virus) PFSense seems does Let&#x27;s encrypt offloading using HAproxy very well. but security is not satisfied like commercial firewalls.
 ​
 what do you suggest?

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>We are in the process of renewing our RDP deployment in Azure. The current servers are all Server 2012 and since this OS will be end of support by October 2023, we have created a new deployment with all Server 2022 VM&#x27;s.
 We provide our applications within the RDP deployment as RemoteApp. Users can acces the RDWeb page through URL cloud.example.com where they have to login and then see the icon(s) of the applications they can use. 
 When the new environment is fully functional, we will point the DNS server to the IP address of the new RDWeb server, but we are not yet fully ready for that. When we open the RDWeb from within the server, we can login and start an application, but when we try to do that from outside the environment (by IP address, ie https://123.12.3.4/rdweb/pages/en-US/default.aspx) we still can login to the server but applications won&#x27;t open. Instead, an error message is shown:
  
RemoteApp Disconnected 
 Remote Desktop can&#x27;t connect to the remote computer &quot;cb.cloud.example.com&quot; for one of these reasons: 
 1) Your user account is not authorized to access the RD Gateway &quot;cloud.example.com&quot;
 2) Your computer is not authorized to access the RD Gateway &quot;cloud.example.com&quot;
 3) You are using an incompatible authentication method (for example, the RD Gateway might be expecting a smart card but you provided a password) 
 Contact your network administrator for assistance.
  
​
 We are not sure why this is happening. Could this be because we are not accessing the environment by the domain cloud.example.com but by IP address? Any suggestions on where to look at are welcome. 
 Of course, I would prefer to test accessing the RemoteApp over the domain name, but unfortunately this requires help from external parties that are not available to me at the moment.

 We are using NPS for our RADIUS authentication for Wi-Fi. This is computer based authentication where the machines are added to an AD group. All was fine until we imaged devices with Windows 11 22H2.
 I&#x27;ve now changed NPS to these settings:
 https://ibb.co/ZxSRh2w
 https://ibb.co/742QX42
 ​
 And GPO:
 https://ibb.co/VVV82Tm
 ​
 IAS Log Viewer for a failed connection:
 https://ibb.co/vwdQcL1
 ​
 I am at my NPS/RADIUS limit. Please send help. Clearly I&#x27;m missing *something*.

                              <span>So, this is a bit of a strange one.
 I have a few users who have told me that some e-mails from specific other users are missing. I can find them in my backup and restore them, but the users are 100% sure they don&#x27;t delete them (I know, I know.. ) they just don&#x27;t show up anymore when they search for them in Outlook. 
 Does any of you have any suggestions where to start? I&#x27;ve told the users that Outlook shouldn&#x27;t be used as an archive for important mails, but still, what could cause this? It seems random and has nothing to do with specific dates or mail older than xx, it&#x27;s just completely random &quot;missing&quot; mail in their inbox. 
 Thanks in advance!

 Figured I&#x27;d post this here. It came across my feeds. Good recommendations to keep secure, lots of good practices.
  
This document explains how to integrate security best practices into typical software development and operations (DevOps) Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) environments, without regard for the specific tools being adapted, and leverages several forms of government guidance to collect and present proper security and privacy controls to harden CI/CD cloud deployments

 TLDR: Where to learn
 ​
 I apologise in advance for the broken english.
 I have been helping around at work (small factory) with the IT system and the ways to improve it.
 Since we obtained good results my boss asked me if I wanted to take on the role full time, since the factory is growing and the old IT systems (all LAN cabled, nothing online, no Active Directory, all devices on microsoft HOME 10 and server with no backup as basically a dump-in archive of documents).
 At this point, improving would mean having a site hosted on our server, dividing it in different virtual machines and setting up a DNS to be able to reach it from outside and inside without displaying the Public IP.
 Now, I have learned by myself 3 quarters of the things I&#x27;ll need to do, the only doubt is the DNS part (and everything correlated as HTTP, Certificates ecc..), since I can&#x27;t really understand where to read online.
 In your experience i need to go the old way and spend some nights on youtube/reddit/forums or there is a book/course you can recommend me?
 ​
 Thanks to everyone for reading all this wall text!

                              <span>Hi,
 so basic premise: We are trying to get intune (we probably only need Plan 1) for the Deployment of Laptops and MDM for our iPhones and iPads, together with it being a good tool for inventory and patch management.
 We are a 250 people company at the end of the year with 4 offices in 1 EU Country, that runs Hybrid with a AD Connector and we will have DC in every office. 
  
Are there relevant benefits for us in intune plan 2? 
 
Regarding safety. Expect the conditional access and some nice to have things like Self service password reset. Any opinions on Azure AD P1/P2? We do use the default MFA functions that come with default o365 
 
Some higher ups want to use Windows Hello For business, is this only in M365 E3 and higher? Currently we run on Win-Licenses for the Device not the user

 For a demo I would like to make a fictional printer that has an IP and MAC adress, so I can add it to a centralised tird party print cloud provider. 
 Do you think this is possible? 
 Kind regards

                              <span>Hey i know this isnt exactly the right subreddit but thought i would ask anyway. I recently started a production support engineer position which has me watching for tickets on jira but right now I am only to watch the test q which gets very few tickets. Even fewer are ones I am confident doing right now. For context, I am 2 months into the job. Alot of the days I might do 1 or 2 tickets and somedays I literally get no tickets. Is this normal for a new employee learning the ropes?

                              <span>We are a small team of developers and growing fast. Atm. everyone does a little bit sysadmin work (Microsoft Intune etc.), but more people beeing hired leads to more work. Its a bit chaotic atm. we have some email issues etc. 
 We decided its time to hire a sysadmin. 
 Now with developers the rule is to give them minimal access, which is required to do their tasks. 
 This rule does not translate well for a sysadmin. He will need full access to our microsoft environment and he will need access to our mail domain account, so he can tweak DNS settings etc. Thats a lot of access.
 I am curious how other companies handle that? Do you give so much access on day 1 or do you give him smaller projects to build trust first?
 Currently I am planing to give him full access to the microsoft environment, but not to DNS settings. Here he has to work with us.

 S1 support just asks us to exclude the file. What.

 we are about to pull the trigger on SentinelOne. 
 We have some doubts on our reseller (EU based). 
 Are there different SKUs for S1 for server and clients? Our reseller insists that there are and they are charging double for those. Apparently the modules are not different in those descriptions. 
 I do not have any access to distributor or other resellers. Could you please just confirm that there are or not those different SKUs.
 ​
 Thank you all in advance.

                              <span>Hello sysadmins,
 We are having an issue in our environment with update KB5014754 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16).
 All our DCs have the security patch installed and when our users try to login with their certificate (using a SmartCard), event 39 is being logged on the event log. We are trying to create a strong certificate binding with the AD attribute altSecurityIdentities (issuer + serial number) but it&#x27;s not working, the event 39 keeps showing after updating the attribute:
 - altSecurityIdentities &#x3D; &#x27;X509:C&#x3D;ES,O&#x3D;(redacted),OU&#x3D;(redacted),OID.2.5.4.97&#x3D;(redacted),CN&#x3D;(redacted)(inverted SN)&#x27;
 We have tried to configure the altSecurityIdentities in several different ways, we have added the certificate to the user on AD and a we have done a lot of different tests, but event 39 keeps appearing, so we are a little bit lost. Do you know where could we investigate further or what could be the cause for event 39 still being logged?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, mainly speaking for NA, a customer is asking their server room to be re-managed/rebuilt.
 ​
 All the system, cables everything is about 20 years old and all of the things inside is out. The room has no cabinet, old pc cases etc. 
 ​
 What I have to do is take the shelves to outside of the room to make up space, build 42U Cabinet, build 2x48 Port switch, couple patch panels, build some rack servers or a workstation. And then move the ups, file server and rest pc&#x27;s to the cabinet, reconnect them. Remake about 20-30 cable connectors, label each of them. 
 ​
 In total cables are about 50 and they only said not to replace the whole cable. Only I can move and make a new connector.
 ​
 The thing is I said to them I would check the parts and prices for them, will not get a commission. 
 It is roughly 5-day job and I am not familiar with the market. New in the country(US-CA) so I would have some opinions if you could just guide me.
 ​
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Like when a user or even a fellow IT employee says something that is just way off base, like suggesting a bad solution to a problem. I always just say &quot;nah that doesn&#x27;t really make sense&quot; in what I feel is a polite/chill and non-condescending tone, but there&#x27;s the nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I&#x27;m putting them down or being rude unintentionally. Am I overthinking, or is there a more professional way to phrase this?

                              <span>I have a DFSN (eg: \\somecompany.local\share1\alpha)
  
If I map it as a drive letter in Windows File Explorer - everything works fine.
 If I type it into the address bar of Windows File Explorer - it doesn&#x27;t resolve.
  
This doesn&#x27;t apply to all our DFSNs, just the ones in the &quot;share1&quot; folder.
 Any ideas?

 TLTR: Used SFC and it fixed an Outlook XLSX attachments and shared files issue.
 I spent 2 days troubleshooting what appeared to be a minor problem: MS Excel would not show who was editing a file (any file) if this specific user tried to open it while it was being edited by somebody else. Files are stored on a Windows Shares. This went on for a few weeks as the user didn&#x27;t really inform IT until this next problem:
 A couple days ago, the user got tired of Excel telling her there were files recovered and answered &quot;No&quot; to not keeping them. The problem above turned to &quot;File is corrupted&quot; when she tried to open any file that was opene…</span>

                              <span>I feel like I&#x27;m overthinking this, but curious as to what&#x27;s best practice for connecting lots of access switches (5-6 in signal closet) at smaller branch offices.
 My typical branch office networks are a single closet with an ISR4k router with one or two 48port access switches behind it. The ISR has a DIA circuit, a private WAN circuit, and the 3rd interface connects to the switch fabric.
 I&#x27;ve got one site that has a crap ton of access ports. The current setup has 5 switches daisy chained using the 10Gb uplink ports. It has been working well enough, but the hardware is up for a refresh, and I&#x27;m curious if &quot;there&#x27;s a better way&quot;.
 The traffic is relatively low, maybe 30~ computers, and about the same or a few more VoIP phones and printers.
 I feel like the &quot;ideal&quot; setup would be some form …</span>

 My question is, can I use my Simplex-Singlemode LC/UPC to LC/APC I currently own, or do I need to buy this specific cable? In a lot of websites I can&#x27;t filter for this specific cable, so I am not sure whether it&#x27;s any different as images of these 2 cable seems to be exactly the same.

                              <span>I’m just trying to confirm that on XR the MTU includes the Ethernet headers etc. So to get a payload of 1500 bytes we would need to set the MTU to 1514 correct?
 Also, from what I understand adding a subinterface will automatically add another 4 bytes making the MTU 1518.
 Is this correct?

                              <span>Got a performance review back today and apparently got maximum points everywhere but customer service. Issue is it is claimed I am too fast to say &quot;not the network.&quot; Crazy thing is I cannot remember one time I said &quot;not the network&quot; and was wrong. Someone says, &quot;it&#x27;s a routing issue&quot; and I am like, &quot;um there are 600 other endpoints in that subnet... if it was a routing problem, none of them would work.&quot; OR I send the ticket back... &quot;What have you done to troubleshoot? Sounds like an authentication issue ... the network isn&#x27;t broken just because the supplicant on the device isn&#x27;t doing 802.1x properly, or it isn&#x27;t joined to the domain OR it isn&#x27;t getting the group policy. All those things aren&#x27;t the network.
 Ultimately, I deployed ISE securing the network and now everything on my side is working but others blame the network each time a device cannot authenticate. It&#x27;s like I secure the network and do my part then when it doesn&#x27;t work, they are mad at me when I don&#x27;t&#x27; manage devices and pass it back to the useless teams that do nothing whatsoever but pass every damned ticket to our NOC. I cannot single handedly deal with every individual devise that acts up out of 50,000 total each time a devices cannot connect to the network.
 Am I wrong for not wanting to do a bunch of handholding for IT people?

                              <span>I remember running into a Reddit post, and someone had commented with a website where there was a TON of various images available. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before. Sadly, I forgot to bookmark it. Does anyone have a link?

                              <span>Hello Cisco Experts,
 I bought the following part numbers thinking I would get two sup (for redundancy) in the switch. When the equiopment arrived, I only received 1 Sup, the chassis, and two line cards. I&#x27;ve opened a case my vendor and awaiting a response.
 C9410R-96U-BNDL-A
 c9400-sup-1xl-b
 Unfortunatley, Cisco&#x27;s website does not provide information regarding this.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m preparing for a computer communication exam and want to make sure I am calculating subnets correctly.
 Let&#x27;s say I have the IP 129.19.40.0/25. I am told to subnet it into three subnets: A, B, and C, where:
  
A has 11 hosts
 B has 12 hosts
 C has 45 hosts
  
Is the following approach correct?
  
Take log₂(#hosts + 2) -- adding 2 for network ID and broadcast addresses. So for instance in the case of subnet A I get: log₂(13) &#x3D; 3.7 --&gt; and rounding up I find that I need 4 bits.
 Then I take the number of bits and adjust the subnet mask accordingly, so again in the case of subnet A instead of using /25 I would use /28 (because the 4 LSB are 0)
 Now I want to find the range of IPs for the subnet, so for subnet A I will start from 129.19.40.1 (since .0 is reserved) and go til 129.19.40.14. The addresses ---.1 and ---.14 here will be the network ID and broadcast addresses, respectively.
 Repeat this process for the remaining subnets, resulting in:
  
 Subnet B: Range &#x3D; 129.19.40.15 - 129.19.40.29, subnet mask \28
 Subnet C: Range &#x3D; 129.19.40.30 - 129.19.40.77, subnet mask \26
  
Thank you in advance to anyone willing to either confirm or correct the above :)

                              <span>So i am operating 3 data halls worth of equipment and need to connect to the power busway in all three data halls. There are 
 DH1- 48 connections
 DH2 - 48 connections
 DH3 - 96 connections
 I am figuring on 4 Cisco Meraki MS120-48 connected to Cisco Meraki MS410-16 for aggregation and connection to our existing network. 
 Networking isn&#x27;t my strongest suit, we currently use Cisco Meraki for all our other switches. That is why they were selected, but i need very little management, and the traffic requirement is pretty low, based on it just being modbus data. If i can do it much cheaper with &quot;dumber/cheaper&quot; devices, is it worth it?

 MSTP is running on all switches. If I turn it off on switch (a), my SIP packet from my phone to 224.0.1.75 makes it to the server. If I turn it back on, it blocks it.
 When MSTP is on, the port state does not change from forwarding. There are no loops.
 Some part of MSTP blocking multicast. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi, I’m looking for a small load balancing router as part of our boon-docking rig. To compensate for shoddy internet access in some of the places we visit, I have Verizon hotspot (no Ethernet port), and Tmobile hotspot (with Ethernet port). I also have Starlink (with Ethernet port). I’m looking for a small router that has a wireless WAN port and two wired WAN ports, that can decide based on link quality, which WAN port to use. I have both 12v and 120V in the rig. I also have a WeBoost RV system to boost cellular signal. Appreciate any ideas.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a portchannel with two 10Gig ports. There are two VLANs in trunk in this portchannel and I would like to limit the bandwidth for the vlan as follows:
 VLAN1990 - Allocated 1Gbit
 VLAN1991 - Allocated 19Gbit
 VLAN1990 is vlan with multicast TV service, when the other VLANs traffic is more than 19Gbit, it causes the disruption of TV service.
 I tried to create the class-map with &quot;match vlan 1990&quot; but this command is apparently not available on C4900M, we are running:

 Is there any way to have the bandwidth allocated?

                              <span>Currently, our team is heavily invested in the process of having field cabling installed. Our approach looks something like this:
  
Ticket arrives requesting additional cabling/outlets from our Service Desk
 
If required, we will visit the site and determine the exact location and placement of the outlets based on the requirements of the customer
 
We take those requirements and feed them to an external cabler for a quotation (Cablers are vetted and know our Standard)
 
Once the quotation is provided we pass this to the end customer and let them review it and decide if they want to proceed
 
If the customer ends up proceeding with the quotation, we will work with our Facilities Maintenance to organize Fire isolation
 
Once the cabling is installed, we will visit the site and patch in outlets, and provide patch leads for the work area
 
 During this process, we are documenting and recording details and keeping a register of all information collected (Quote, Request details, Cable test results etc.). We&#x27;re doing this about 2-3 times a week. I find this is somewhat &quot;low value&quot; work I&#x27;m wondering if others push this to their facilities team and only interface in this work as a point of escalation?
 Some of the drawbacks to doing this:
  
Staff are fickle, things change and a single site visit can turn into multiple
 
Stuff changes, cabling can be installed as requested, and then a project changes its mind and the desks are now on the other side of the room
 
Sometimes with this work, you become a defacto project manager because the cabling is in the critical path
 
There are only so many hours in the day while doing this work... you&#x27;re not deploying new kit or working on audits and cleanups
 
This process is followed by our Junior and Senior Engineers alike

                              <span>Hey guys：
 We have some standalone ESXi hosts in our company. Recently we encountered a werid issue where the mac address of the ESXi host flapping.
 Issue description:
 I found that the IP of some esxi hosts will occasionally be unable to ping, but the vm network on the host will not be interrupted. At this time, if you ping the IP of the ESXi host on a server in the same VLAN, the ESXi host network will be restored.
 At first, I thought it was due to the EEE function of the NIC. So I upgraded ESXi version(ESXi 6.5 -6.7-7.0), disabled the igbn driver and enabled the ign driver, disabled EEE function but these did not work.
 I finally found that when the issue occurred, ESXi host MAC would flap to G2/1 port. G2/1 port is connected to Sangfor Access Control Device and AC device is connected…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have an unorthodox situation I&#x27;m trying to figure out. I&#x27;m going to give a very simplified version of the problem I am trying to solve, for simplicity purposes.
 I hope that the smart people here can help me out so that I don&#x27;t need to buy and install additional copper NICs.
 We are in the midst of a network re-design so I am trying to make do with what we have at this current time to try to make my new server function. In a nutshell, I want to combine what used to be two copper access ports from two physically separate networks to a single SFP connection which my new server has, and assign them to my VMs by VLAN. 
 Old scenario:
 I have an old server that had 2 copper NICs each connected to respectively 2 physically separate networks. The access ports come from Cisco 2960X without VLANs configured. At this time, it is not possible to have these reconfigured.
 On the server, NIC1/Network 1 was attached to VM1, and NIC2/Network 2 was attached to VM2.
 This has worked fine for years.
 New scenario:
 I have a new server that only has 1 SFP port.
 Is there a way I can combine or (reverse) trunk these two networks so that my new server can see either network depending on what VLAN I assign to each VM?
 I tried to create two access ports, Port1 on VLAN10 for Network 1, and Port 2 on VLAN 20 for Network 2. I then connected Port 24 (SFP Trunk) to my new server. This didn&#x27;t seem to work.
 I have been toying with the scenario and it doesn&#x27;t work. I know I must be doing something silly, but I feel like there should be a way to make it functional.
 I have a diagram drawn up of my test design but I can&#x27;t seem to upload it yet as I might be too new.
 Hope someone can help!
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working for a company that has oil wells spread across several thousand acres of land. There are thousands of wells, which encompass miles of land. 
 We&#x27;re installing devices on the wells that will provide measurements for what is going on. However, we need some kind of network to get the data to our offices. 
 We have a separate electrical grid that supplies power to all of the wells, so that is not an issue. 
 What is the best solution here? Is there way to have a giant mesh network with thousands of nodes all connected to each other over this giant acreage? What are some possibilities for creating such a network?

                              <span>I have a S3400-48T4SP switch and mainly bought it for the POE side for a project I am working on. That being said, I see it has what appears to be a DHCP server on board. Has anyone ever used their DHCP server in general?The config seems straightforward but when trying to actually obtain an address on a port, the clients are not succesful. Haven&#x27;t done any fancy packet captures and so on yet, just trying to see if there are obvious things to look out for as the documentation is a bit sparse.
 THIS IS A BUSINESS TOPIC.

                              <span>Checking DHCP (Server 2019 Standard) Statistics for a scope I see Total / In Use / Available are all 0(%). However, checking leases I see several dozen leases. This is a /22 and only like 145 leases are issued. 
 This agrees with &#x27;netsh dhcp server scope ...&#x27;
 But, since 0% is available now new clients are being thrown to APIPA. 
 No changes recently on this scope - and this isn&#x27;t the only scope that has this. Not many are showing this, but a couple.
 Any suggestions on threads to pull on?
 EDIT: Reboot didn&#x27;t help. About half of scopes on this server are in this state, but a whole lot of the main and important scopes are not. Which is nice. Any device attempting to receive an address from this scope just doesn&#x27;t receive an offer. They&#x27;re shouting into the wind and no one listens. Change that VLAN to a working one and it works just fine. 
 Apparently the only difference is that one of my coworkers is working with split scope and a failover server (this is currently only the up and coming DHCP server that&#x27;s going to replace an RHEL server that&#x27;s still shouldering most of the load right now).

 Good day folks, Need some help related to a networking issue. I’m in no way an expert or even half decent in these things, so bear with me if some things I say makes no sense. 
 For reference, Im onboard a Cargo ship in the Pacific and we’re facing internet issues, specifically with WiFi onboard. I’ve posted a picture ( link at start) trying to explain as best as I can. 
 We have Starlink internet installed onboard, and the internet goes through a Data centre ( In picture). The main internet cable from starlink goes in to the ZWANA firewall ( red box). 
 From Zwana, the cable goes to the back of HPE Officeconnect 1920S Series switch ( Idk what this box is, but as shown in the pic all other equipment’s that need internet onboard are connected here).
 From here ( HPE …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m using netmiko so do work on remote devices in other countries. Some of them have very large configs on them and when I do a show run on these devices, it&#x27;s timing out. I can see in the logging that it&#x27;s doing the show run, but eventually it just times out the netmiko connection.
 I have tried a few iterations of running the command but no luck:
 sh_run &#x3D; net_connect.send_command_expect(&#x27;show running-config&#x27;, expect_string&#x3D;r&#x27;#&#x27;, delay_factor&#x3D;2, max_loops&#x3D;600) sh_run &#x3D; net_connect.send_command_expect(&#x27;show running-config&#x27;, expect_string&#x3D;r&#x27;#&#x27;) 
 Update:
 I forgot to mention, I have also tried having a really long timeout with: &#x27;global_delay_factor&#x27;: in the connect handler settings but that doesn&#x27;t help either.
 ​
 This is the error:
 raise ReadTimeout(msg)
 netmiko.exceptions.ReadTimeout:
 Pattern not detected: &#x27;tz\\-core\\-rtr\\-1\\#&#x27; in output.
 It looks like it&#x27;s timing out because it doesn&#x27;t see the router prompt quick enough and times out.
 Anybody had similar issues and were able to work around this?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking at doing a refresh for our firewalls. For budget reasons our two main contenders seem to be Fortigate and Checkpoint.
 General office setup: no fancy routing so the edge devices will connect directly to the ISP over 10 Gig. Probably won&#x27;t need BGP, but if we do in the future, it won&#x27;t be any fancy (one ASN, one block of IPv4/6). Some SSL VPN will be used, but not heavily.
 Currently there will be only one fibre, but we&#x27;ll probably get a second unit as a warm stand-by, so if the primary goes sides ways we could perhaps just move the fibre over. We may go with a second uplink later.
 Any preferences for Fortigate and Checkpoint? Palo Alto is often recommended, but that&#x27;s a bit too much for us; Fortigate generally is also mentioned, but I&#x27;m curious about Checkpoint.
 Our co-lo DC will also probably need a refresh soon-ish, so we may go with the same vendor there as well. It&#x27;s also currently 10Gig without HA. There we may stay with 10 Gig with the refresh, or perhaps go with a 100 Gig optic: not so much for the extra bandwidth, but for easier work with regards to provisioning and port availability: any difference with Fortigate and Checkpoint for 100G?
 Thanks for any info.
 (Internally the office gear will be access-layer PoE switches, APs, and a small server room. More familiar with switching gear, so have a good feel for the options.)

                              <span>Contractor is installing Leaker Cable in a building to improve fire/aid radio signal. I notice they have run it in some of our cable trays and am concerned it may cause crosstalk. This is replacing an older leaky install that was not run in cable trays so that gives me another reason to question the new install. The contractor says no, but we want a second opinion. Thanks!

 I&#x27;m not sure where to turn to but, since this is about my network rack, I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d ask here. If there is a more appropriate place to ask, please let me know.
 I need to install an Eaton 5P 3000 UPS in a two post rack. The posts are 6.5 inches on the side. I&#x27;m not having luck finding rails/mounting hardware for that. The searches turn up rails for server racks and I can&#x27;t use those here. I got something from my Eaton vendor, PN 103007018-5591, but they are only 3.5 inch so too small. He wasn&#x27;t much help beyond that. Does anyone have any suggestions here?

 Because we have entire SA network sites. It’s awful and time consuming for me to manually draw the network diagram using MS VISIO. 
 I want to pull the info via LLDP, so output of the diagram could include the following: all devices mainly switches with their names, IP address of each switch, trunk links, ports numbers. 
 Any suggestions/recommendations/sample scripts.

 I posted here a while back and it took me in some interesting research directions. Today, though, I come with a different issue.

I am working from the command line and I&#x27;m sending stuff like snmpget -u username -l authPriv -a bla -A bla and so on.
 I read in the docs that I should be able to store all the credentials in the snmp.conf file and just run the command like snmpget host:port mib::oid, but this is not working - it just times out with no response from the host. Meanwhile, when providing everything in the command line and cleaning my snmp.conf everything works as expected. Any thoughts on where I&#x27;m screwing up, or how I can actually use the credentials from a file instead of the command line?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with creating the most simple file share possible. Basically we&#x27;re looking for a solution that a quick link and login where people can drop files to be shared with the rest of the group. I&#x27;ve also been asked to included a calendar.
 My first thought was to enable quick connect on our synology NAS and only allow these users access to a specific folder and calendar. However, I&#x27;m a little leery exposing our NAS to the internet like this. 
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m willing to purchase Xiaomi Mi Router 4C (White), 300 Mbps router but have something to clarify before purchasing it.
 So, I have a fibre internet connection and a WiFi router which gives me around 200Mbps - 300Mbps of speed with Ethernet connected. But it drops to 15Mbps - 60 Mbps with WiFi while I&#x27;m just 1m away from the router. To be specific, it is a ZTE ZXFHN F660 Fibre router which I think has a crappy WiFi connection.
 By purchasing this Xiaomi Mi Router 4C (White), 300 Mbps router I&#x27;m willing to get a better internet speed with WiFi. At least more than 100Mbps.
 Do you guys it will be able to do that?

                              <span>Hi, I am new here but I know basic networking stuffs. Please excuse me if my question sounds very noob-like or stupid.
 Our offices are situated inside basement. 1 is an elevated office, 1 is on the basement level. Both offices are about 300 meters away. Cabling cannot be done due to structural restrictions however I can see the other office in sight from the elevated office. We&#x27;re getting business wireless internet installed in the elevated office. I was hoping if anyone can suggest what would be the best wireless router that can reach the other office easily. I heard mesh WiFi works best here but between 2 offices, there is an empty space where you cannot connect any mesh router in between to keep the signal strong. Or there has to be a long range 1 directional router that has like 500m to 1km range like a radar but should not be too expensive.
 Please help. Thank you!

                              <span>A little context on the situation:
 Our ISP service is fiber, and is delivered via an ONT aka modem. 
 ​
 The service is VLAN trunked to deliver:
 - Internet VLAN 10
 - IPTV VLAN20
 - Voice VLAN30
 - Management VLAN40
 It is supposed to be delivered to a ISP provided gateway.
 ​
 So to break this apart, we put in a managed L2 switch a SG200-08 in between to run our firewall(s)
 For management and security:
 - Management VLAN1 (Port 8 - yes i know but its a small mom and pop business - please ignore)
 - ISP Untagged (nothing delivered on this) - VLAN9 (only port1)
 - ISP tagged VLAN10/20/30/40 (trunked on port 1)
 - Port 2-3 (untagged VLAN10)
 ​
 For some weird reason I&#x27;m trying to comprehend, it had worked fine over the months/years.
 Recently, I get complaints of Whatsapp calls not going through / not connecting.
 I&#x27;ve since:
 - changed to another router Ubiquiti Edgerouter (on the same setup above) plugged to both port 2 or 3
 Same result.
 ​
 Removing the SG200, and going back with the ISP router - issue resolved.
 ​
 Here comes the kicker, putting in a Mikrotik RB260GS - the issue vanishes - with both Edgerouter and exisitng firewall. 
 ​
 The minute the SG200 is in the picture, the setup fails.
 ​
 Any ideas?

 Currently using Alcatel AP but I want to change some to cisco AP. Is roaming between different vendor APs smooth under the following conditions? If roaming is possible but not perfect conditions are also welcome. I look forward to hearing from you:)

 Lots of high rise buildings do eco cooling on the weekends but unlike office space, machine rooms don’t take a day off. Have you had luck tying into dedicated cooling loops?

                              <span>I had to move my test lab to a new location, and with it I had to setup a new VPN to remotly access it. Only thing I have available currently is an ASA. I simply have a public IP given and that&#x27;s all. I have a single /24 network for my internal net, and my WAN setup. My internet net stuff needs to be able to reach the internet, and I need to be able to reach it over the VPN.
 ​
 I setup a remote access ssl vpn to connect to with anyconnect. However, it fails to connect to anything internally because the internal network uses PAT to go out the WAN. So I setup another NAT rule to exempt translation when going from outside to inside (i&#x27;m not sure why this is default) and this works to access everything behind the firewall, I just can&#x27;t directly manage the firewall from the VPN, it tells me routing failed to locate the next hop.
 ​
 Is this the best way to apporach this? It feels a little wonky.

                              <span>Hi,
 I recently got hired as the sole IT guy in a very tiny company with 8 employees.
 The situation looks as follows:
  
Each employee uses THEIR OWN PC (except for myself) for all of the work that they do. Those PCs are all MacBook pros. There are no onsite PCs at the office (besides the one I use).
 The company uses OneDrive as its storage of ALL company files, except for some confidential documents such as employee contracts. Those are stored on the boss&#x27; own PC, and that&#x27;s it...
 All of the employees at the company are tech-illiterate, including the boss.
 Each user has the OneDrive application installed on their PC so it can sync the OneDrive files with their PCs file manager.
 None of the OneDrive directories are compartmentalized. Despite the employees being responsible for differe…</span>

                              <span>Maybe this is just my own personal trigger, but i just don&#x27;t understand why a good portion of our employees (even some on our own IT team) feel like everything they click on must be done with a double click? i can understand users getting confused because certain things like navigating file shares and what not do require double clicks, but you&#x27;d think if you use a computer at your job for 6-8 hours a day you&#x27;d grasp the concept that not all things on computers need a double click.
 I&#x27;ve seen it all too often in my years of support tickets where someone will get angry because they always end up opening 2 of everything in their taskbar and can&#x27;t fathom the thought that its because they are double clicking on pinned icons because &quot;double clicking works for most things&quot;. makes ya just wanna scream right?
 Went over the edge today because I was training up one of our members of the service desk on usage of one of our web apps. a good friend of mine and we&#x27;ve been working together for years. he double clicks on EVERYTHING! and It just so happens that in this web app ... when you double click on a particular menu, it opens another window in browser ... which for this dude he was opening 2 windows every time. i keep telling him for years to stop double clicking on anything in a web browser because you dont need to, but y&#x27;know ... he still does and jokes about the web app just being crappy....which to an extent i get, but still maybe start with kicking the impulse to stop double clicking on everything your mouse is on??
 Am i alone here or is anyone else quietly dealing with this for their user base?

 &quot;But, are you sure we have enough bandwidth? I can do some analysis if you like? &quot;
 &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about that, whatever we save in on prem, we can use for upgrade&quot;
 &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t we upgrade first?&quot;
 &quot;Let&#x27;s just see how it goes&quot;
 &quot;Okay..., if you insist...&quot;
 ...
 ...
 &quot;All done, clouded and automateded&quot;
 &quot;But why is everything so slow?&quot;
 &quot;Because we&#x27;re saturating our bandwidth&quot;
 &quot;Can&#x27;t we move some stuff out of hours?&quot;
 &quot;Everything is already out of hours where possible&quot;
 &quot;Compression? &quot;
 &quot;We do that already, we need to increase bandwidth&quot;
 &quot;What about...&quot;
 &quot;We&#x27;re doing everything we can. Including blocking high bandwidth application profiles on the Firewall. Yes there&#x27;s been complaints about YouTube.&quot;
 &quot;Aah. Perhaps I&#x27;ll get a consultant...&quot;
 ...
 ...
 &quot;The consultant asks if we&#x27;ve considered moving some stuff on prem...&quot;
 Just do that damn traffic analysis...

 What do you all recommend? We understand they both support vSphere the same but we also use Nutanix AHV. I have heard Cohesity isn&#x27;t as &#x27;fully featured&#x27; in the AHV side of things, is this true? If so, what can&#x27;t you do in Cohesity that you can do in Rubrik?

                              <span>This is very multi disciplinary - but say one had an enterprise data centre using about 300kW steady-state, could one feasibly divert the heat output via water cooling to a swimming pool 180 metres down the road?
 I mean - anything is possible, but is this practical? Say you had to replace all of the servers anyway over the next 5 years, buying in water-cooled servers is doable. The work would be, in my head:
 compatible cabinets
 add a cooling loop
 dig a trench between the DC and the pool
 &quot;hook it up&quot; at either end
 make sure there&#x27;s some cooling via traditional coolers for when the pool is the right temp
 Am I missing something that&#x27;s really obvious? Is the carbon effort of the road/pavement digging never going to be recouped for example? Does anyone know how to work this kind of thing out?

                              <span>Working with a larger org right now and the network is laid out as a hub and spoke topology where the spokes can&#x27;t talk to each other. There was a plan to put a DC at each site so users can authenticate to machines in the event of a link failure back to the hub. The AD team is saying this network topology doesnt work because all DCs need to be able to talk to each other for replication. I&#x27;m not an AD guru by any means, but isn&#x27;t this the purpose of having different AD sites?

                              <span>Hello. I ran a Nessus can against our machines and had the Sweet32 vulnerability. I found an article that explained how to fix the issue by adding registry keys to disable the RC4 and 3DES, which I did for one of our domain controllers. My colleague then tells me that no new devices can be added to the domain (works when the domain controller is shut down and the other DC is used).
 I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence or whether it had actually broken the server. Has anyone had issues after doing this fix?

                              <span>Personally I used TeamViewer for my home computers and family that I would assist. Recently they dropped the max clients to 3, which doesn&#x27;t work. Looking around I found DWS Remote Control. Web based control. Installed it on a VM, seems to work really really well. And it&#x27;s 100% no matter what (they just limit the bandwidth). You can pay for subs to support them and you get higher bandwidth.
 My question is this: Has anyone heard of them? Heard bad things (security and that fun stuff)? I had never heard of them until this week and for a free product that works this well, too good to be true kind of thing.
 We pay for Dameware MRCC now and it &quot;works&quot;, has little issues now and then but I was thinking of talking to my team about switching. Just want to make sure it&#x27;s not known for being insecure and all that stuff we are paid to worry about.
 Thanks for any input!

 I ask because I&#x27;d really like to be able to just give a YubiKey to a user and off they go. After testing out the self-enrollment process.....this is going to be frustrating for a lot of my users.
 EDIT: Sorry...this is for Azure AD multi-factor authentication.

                              <span>Hi,
 We’re decommissioning exchange 2013. All mailboxes and routing to and from have stopped. Server been offline for7 days now (we wanted to see the impacts once it was removed). What’s our next step? We have ADSync which can create new users from AD (or just go cloud). We have power shell scrips ready to maintain what we have (e.g. global address list). I’m hesitant to just uninstall exchange server all as there’s no undo for that. Note: I am more of a jr sys admin so anything will help.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have an issue with a Macbook that we have set up through Apple Business Manager/Intune. The problem is that the person cannot download any applications from the App Store. All the &quot;get&quot; buttons are grayed out.
 Now, one would naturally expect that this is a permissions-related issue. However, the other Macbooks that were set up in the same way do not have this problem!
 The Macbook is already running the latest version of macOS, and everything else is up to date. Any ideas?

                              <span>I have a client that has a .ws domain that they bought years ago with Registrar.com, but wanted to try to migrate as I wasn&#x27;t fond of their UI and most feedback on them is not great. I was trying to find a decent registrar that I could transfer their domain to, but not having much luck. Cloudflare that I normally use for domains doesn&#x27;t support that TLD. A couple of registrars I was searching either didn&#x27;t support the TLD or wanted a decent chunk to make an offer, which seems odd as you would think that you could transfer it once you unlocked it like any offer TLD. Any suggestions for a worthwhile registrar for this?

                              <span>I’m receiving a constant supply of “genuine emails” but not for things intended for me.
 A handful of folks seemingly across the globe, are using the address of my gmail account for things like car hire, hotel stays, travel tickets…
 I fail to believe this is a genuine typo, based on the constant and multiple usage…
 My account is protected with 2FA with Yubikey and there’s no bizarre location/device history in my account settings.
 In most cases I am able to sign in to the sites/services in question and in doing so I can identify contact info, update details and occasionally cancel and/or even purchase additional things.
 I’m confused as to how and why this is occurring. My assumption is fake credit cards and the users aren’t bothered by the receipt of the emails… but then you wouldn’t use genuine information such as home addresses and phone numbers…

                              <span>Hey all,
 Been working in IT for 8 years as of this July. Just wondering if anyone else uses their expertise and knowledge for a side hustle? I work full time so it would only be in my spare time. So, how has that gone for people doing it? I&#x27;m just after some spare cash. I&#x27;m not looking to set up a proper business or grow it or anything. 
 The only thing that puts me off is I don&#x27;t live near a big city its mostly rural towns where I live but I was thinking of setting up a consumer IT support service in my local area for home users.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Shot in the dark here, does anyone know of any automated way I can DBAN my workstations then install Windows over the top?
 I&#x27;ve got 100&#x27;s of PC&#x27;s to wipe and I&#x27;d like to not have to manually run DBAN on each and then MDT them all after, if its possible to do both in 1 shot.
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am running Linux Mint 21.1.
 Let&#x27;s say I were using OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) to record a video on my laptop. How could I have that video directly streamed to my Google Drive account?
 Here&#x27;s my use case: let&#x27;s say I had been using OBS to record a video for 27 minutes. If, something were to go awry on my end, let&#x27;s say, I inadvertently quit out of OBS or OBS were to crash, I still want those 27 minutes to be stored on my Google Drive account.

                              <span>Looking to deploy certain applications to the Company Portal via the &quot;Microsoft Store App (new)&quot; option in Intune as it makes more sense than us manually uploading x amount of binaries and keeping them patched manually (across numerous tenancies). 
 I&#x27;ve spent some time today trying to ascertain if the Microsoft Store applications are actually safe/verified. I&#x27;m aware there is an application checking process but the description doesn&#x27;t give me full confidence. I&#x27;m having trouble finding if only Mozilla can add Firefox, only Fortinet can add Forticlient (etc), and that those publishers are verified so we don&#x27;t end up deploying a fake application to anyone.
 Does anyone do this? Are the MS Store apps available via Intune considered safe to deploy?

 When users login can they login with either domain on a computer? Will it create a new profile in Windows or does it recognize it as the same user? Any other things I should watch for?
 Thank You Sysadmins!

 When we make a series of meetings that spans over 6 months and &#x27;invite&#x27; a meetingroom the room will reject all meetings if theres 1 single conflict.
 Meetings are done through Outlook calendar. Would it be possible to get some sort of notification that ex. 5 out of 6 meetings are accepted but 1 meeting has an conflict?
 Some values of current calendarprocessing:
 &gt; &gt; &gt; Get-CalendarProcessing &quot;Meetingroom A&quot; | select ConflictPercentageAllowed,allowconflicts,MaximumConflictInstances: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ConflictPercentageAllowed AllowConflicts MaximumConflictInstances &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------- -------------- ------------------------ &gt; &gt; &gt; 0 False 5

I would say, i can take care a lot of the daily operation tasks as sysadmin. but deeper like troubleshooting why suddenly all DHCP clients&#x27; lease time is 1 hours, instead 3 days or 7 days in a DHCP failover servers. We have like 2 guys in manger position with at lease 20 years of experience know lot more that me. 
 Each time we have issue in that level, i asked got blame for not doing much from the top level manger. Got asked, something like, how many servers you take care, how much do you know each severs.

 I am being moved to another team which no longer matches what my current responsibilities are and I want to avoid and set a precedent for myself being buried with work and being underpaid. What are things I can ask for and bring up. Is this even a valid case for a raise, as the role is much more demanding than what I was previously doing.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve been in the IT side of things for a couple of decades but surprisingly somehow never grasped Kerberos all that well and combing through different literature never gave me what I wanted to know in one place regarding what actually happens in Active Directory networks. As part of the (re)learning process I ended up creating a diagram that I feel breaks it down a bit more thoroughly end-to-end.

 The fonts used in the original Visio didn&#x27;t make it into the export so some text alignment may be off depending on browser (rendering may be better in Chrome).
 This workflow is probably not 100% accurate and I could use feedback on any corrections or glaring ommissions. I&#x27;ve had to consult a number of books, online blogs, YouTube videos, my own lab packet captures, etc. to figure this out. It&#x27;s a bit of a visual mess due to the number of moving parts involved but maybe this may be useful to some people and/or they can provide suggestions for improvements. Making these diagrams is sort of a side hobby for me.

                              <span>I found another post about this happening almost a year ago here on reddit, but I&#x27;m not seeing one from today. C-Level email was hacked about 4 hours ago. I locked the O365 account to boot the hacker. I still see emails going out through barracuda, I&#x27;m not sure if the email going out now are coming from a cue or if somehow emails are still being sent.
 I&#x27;ve logged into AZURE and I can see the malicious login. It says there was a login attempt with DEVMAIL the first one says interrupted, then the next one says success.
 User did not get a 2FA text. He hasn&#x27;t used his computer today which I would think would rule out an infection on his machine. His current active device would be his iphone.
 Anyone else get and Office 365 (2FA protected) account hacked today? Any direction would be appreciated. Thanks all.

                              <span>So have this issue also when upgrading win10 to win11 22h2 where after the upgrade Office 365 32bit and Adobe acrobat XI or 2017 will not open. Now we have an issue in out test group with the June patches where some office 365 and/or Adobe products will not open this is on windows 10 machines. Most are running 32bit office 365 that broke but had some 64bit office also break after patching. Seems to happen on about 7-8% of our test group. Heard from a couple other IT groups that the June patches they are experiencing office and adobe product breaks. Anybody seen this?

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all,
 I recently had a conversation with my 14-year-old nephew, and he expressed a strong interest in pursuing a career in IT/Information Security. As someone who works in IT myself but doesn&#x27;t honestly know all that much (especially career/education advice), I thought it might be advantageous to seek advice from this wonderful community on how to guide him in the right direction. He currently holds the CompTIA Security+ (which he took in April), and I advised him to go for CCNA or another Cisco cert next. What other bits of advice should I pass along to him when I see him next?

                              <span>I noticed this at the last position that the IT depart was under control from someone who was in Accounting, and similar with my current position (current position makes more sense since they&#x27;re a controller of the company but they seem more like accounting too.) I&#x27;m used to working with an IT director that work along side other department heads. Just was wondering if anyone else has a similar arrangement?
 Edit: To add, did the department manage operations, like how they wanted the department to be run?

                              <span>They are letting go their lone IT guy, who is leaving very hostile and has all passwords in his head with no documentation or handoff. He has indicated that he may give domain password but that is it, no further communications. How do you proceed? There is literally hundreds of bits of information that will be lost just off the top of my head, let alone all of the security concerns.
 ​
  
Immediate steps? 
 Change all passwords everywhere, on everything right down to the toaster - including all end users, since no idea whose passwords he may know 
 have to hunt down all online services and portals, as well
 
 manually review all firewall rules
  Review all users in AD to see if any stand out- also audit against current employee list
 
 What to do for learning the environment? 
 Do the old eye test - physically walk and crawl around
 any good discovery or scanning tools?
 
 Things to do or think about moving forward 
 implement a password manager and official documentation
 love the idea of engaging a 3rd party for security audit of some kind to catch issues I may not be aware of
 review his email history to identify vendors, contracts, licenses, etc. 
 engage with all existing vendors to try to get a handle on things
 
 
 Far off things to think about 
 domain registration expiration
 certificates
 contracts

                              <span>Hi,
 We are finally moving away from McAfee Enterprise and are uninstalling it from our servers.
 For some reason not all of the services are being removed.
 McAfee Service Controller,
 McAfee Firewall Core Service and
 McAfee Validation Trust Protection Service are still there.
 I cannot get them removed. From the services console, I get an access denied. When I try it through the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services) I get an access denied as well.
 It is not possible (as far as I have tried) to change the permissions on the services and program files or gain ownership. I tried running the commandline as SYSTEM (psexec -i -s cmd.exe), still access denied.
 I tried some consumer tools to remove it. From McAfee: MCPR.exe, did not work because it&#x27;s for consumer products only. I tried ESET AV remover, did not work.
 For now, the only thing that does work is to start the server in save mode and remove the registry keys manually. I truly hope that there is a better way to accomplish this and hope that someone knows that way and is willing to share it with me.
 Thanks! (a lot!)

                              <span>I recently inherited an intern and I&#x27;m not thrilled about it. I respect the fact that everyone has to start somewhere but teaching an intern is going to be a major work multiplier. It&#x27;s one thing to onboard a new employee that you know will be staying in the organization. Having an intern come 4 hours a day for 4 weeks is different. I often multitask and sometimes I just research problem resolutions. I feel like the sink or swim approach is what made me good in my field. I have for the most part taught myself everything that I know. I&#x27;m curious to know others thoughts on interns. We are a small organization &lt;60 employees, 2 servers, 4 network closets. It is not a complicated environment.

 List EOL dates for several products.
 maybe it helps someone if the maintainers of the website keep it up for long.
 PS: interesting there are flairs for discussions and rants, but not for resources.

                              <span>I have been in IT/Security for about 4 years now. 1 year at helpdesk, and 3 years in cyber security. My helpdesk role was more of a systems admin role than a helpdesk role. I was able to make the leap into security because I was manning the IDS/IPS and Defender alerts as helpdesk.
 I started a role at a new company about 1.5 years ago, and everyday I have the worst anxiety of my life before I clock in. Feels like I have 1,000 butterfly&#x27;s going crazy in my gut. I am paid an ungodly amount of money to do this job, and I feel like I am absolutely horrible at this.
 Whenever I report a vulnerability, the IT manager ALWAYS comes back at me saying that he doesnt believe the risk is there and that the system doesnt need to be patched. I was taught to go by zero trust, and understand that things like lateral movements exist. Pwning a UPS or some other IoT device can lead to lateral movement, especially when we have no XDR solution and rely only on EDR. I believe some of the issue can come from him being 40 years older than me. He says I go off buzz words too much. Its quite clear he does not like me, and honestly I am ok with that. It just makes my job harder when they dont want to patch internal systems because the risk is not there.
 This makes me feel like I dont know what I am doing. How do I get inside this guys head to understand what he wants? how do I evaluate risk from his perspective when I&#x27;ve had zero trust ingrained in my brain for years prior and certifications.

                              <span>Desperately need help debuging the following bug.... i just stend 2 weeks smashing my head on my desk not understanding what&#x27;s going on.
 So i have this application that need to connect to my server on port tcp/XXXX . Nothing special, just a TCP connexion, no TLS, No nothing. Just TCP push. On the server i have a service listening on this specific port. It IS listening we have verified.
 But When users are on-site the connection is dropped by the server ! 
 -Connection as ALLOWED by Firewall
 - Network capture mark the connexion cut by my server at the 4th packet of the TCP handshack 
 (client-&gt;server) SYN
 (server-&gt;client) SYN ACK
 (client-&gt;server)ACK 
 (server-&gt;client) ACK-FIN .
 -Activating WFP logs in windows even viewer on the server i saw that the connexion was Stealth-Drop by windows :
 Event ID : 5152
 The Windows Filtering Platform has blocked a packet.
 Application Information:
 Process ID: 0 Application Name: - 
 Network Information:
 Direction: Inbound Source Address: IP Source Port: sourceport Destination Address: IP Destination Port: Myport-listening Protocol: 6 
 Filter Information:
 Filter Origin: Stealth Filter Run-Time ID: netsh wfp show state tell me it&#x27;s &quot;Port Scanning Prevention Filter&quot; Layer Name: Transport Layer Run-Time ID: 13 
 ​
 Now , if this was all this could be easy. BUT NO. 
 Because it DOES work when the users are connected from their home (ipsec tunnel i think ?)
 but NOT when they are on-site, closer to the server.
 ​
 The port is open, we checked 4 times on our firewalls. The paquets are not modified by the networking equipement. No they really are dropped by windows to &quot;prevent port Scanning&quot; but it shouldn&#x27;t be considered port scanning when the service is listening ???? And why would it WORK or not work depending on client user IP ?
 We even checked with windows defender, firewall and local antivirus disabled but it still behave the same...
 Any idea or i am going mad ? 
 Thanks in advance.

 Ensure that mobile devices require complex passwords (Type &#x3D; Alphanumeric)
 Ensure that mobile device password reuse is prohibited
 Ensure that mobile devices require complex passwords (Simple Passwords &#x3D; Blocked)
 Ensure mobile devices require the use of a password

We have a ton of it like keyboards, mice, older monitors and even a few older KVM switches. How do you go about contacting local orgs like schools and what not to see if we can&#x27;t donate? We were thinking of doing an employee giveaway but we have so much stuff that we can&#x27;t possibly give it all away to them.

                              <span>Just started doing some work for a customer who has a Windows Storage Server 2016 machine purchased from Dell.
 They would like to upgrade. They purchased Server 2019, licenses and cals (several years ago and its been sitting around collecting dust which is why they brought me on board as a consultant to do the upgrade, previous employee who managed their machines retired to florida during covid lockdowns), but it appears it is not possible to upgrade from Storage Server 2016 to 2019. Only a fresh installation is available on the setup screen.
 This makes sense I guess, since it would be like upgrading DataCenter 2016 to Standard 2019.
 However, the machine is not using any special features of Storage Server. Its just the version that came with the machine because I guess it had a MD1200 array attached to it.
 A fresh install really isn&#x27;t an option either since there are a few other pieces of software on here (a SQL Server 2019 instance and some CRM software supplied by a 3rd party vendor which runs through IIS and uses the SQL database to store data).
 I am guessing when they got the CRM software w/ SQL 2019, they got the Windows Server 2019 disk to upgrade and ran into this problem so &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&quot;. Bringing the CRM vendor on-site to do a re-install would be expensive and they&#x27;d like to avoid it. This customer does not have internet access for their network so remote vpn isn&#x27;t an option there. Someone has to fly in.
 So, is there any way to get server 2019 installed on this box w/o a format, e.g.
 a) can I somehow change the product key on the existing Windows Storage Server 2016 install to a Windows Server Standard 2016 product key and then do the &quot;upgrade&quot; (I did try this but it says my windows server 2016 product key is invalid, which I know it isn&#x27;t, since its in use on a real 2016 server at the moment (e.g. &quot;downgrade&quot; the server), or
 b) can I somehow &#x27;trick&#x27; the installation process to ignore the version?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I’ve found the ability in GPO to list the ciphers that we want used in the environment. However this seems it would exclude the use of newer ciphers unless the list is updated. I don’t want that. 
 I simply want to remove the ability to use deprecated ciphers across hundreds of servers. As I understand it these are usually turned off and added via windows updates, but that’s the catch isn’t it. 
 Is there a better way to limit old ciphers but allow new ones to be added? The GPO seems like it’s not the solution.

                              <span>We have very few servers in our environment, and one of them is a DC.
 I would like an external support dept to monitor and patch our servers (they offer 24/7), but I have a dilemma.
 I have to give them domain admin accounts so they can patch the DC - how do i know, they only focus on patching/updating and don&#x27;t access our AD or other stuff? Is that auditable, or is it possible to put alarms or restrictions in place?
 Perhaps you have an even better recommendation?

                              <span>Hi Wizards,
 I&#x27;m Junior guy taking care of some of our systems in our company as well as user support, lately I&#x27;m noticing more and more users are asking me about theirs mailbox sizes are getting full (like 90gb of 100gb), and I&#x27;m not really sure what to do about it ?
 For now I&#x27;m sending them to this guide https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/manage-my-mailbox-size-792b521c-3f4e-404e-b436-9c197bad6f45 as I don&#x27;t find better solution than basically archive old mails which they don&#x27;t access frequently, but to be honest I don&#x27;t know how that works completely as well. 
 Sorry if this is basic trash question above everyone and I&#x27;m wasting your time.
 That fat IT guy.

                              <span>I have multiple network printers showing up fine on the new settings panel on client devices but when I go to print management on the local machine it shows no printers are installed? 
 I really dislike the new settings panel and would prefer to have print management be used.
 Anyone have any ideas why this would be?

                              <span>For decades, I have used Windows Task Scheduler to run small processing jobs nightly. Currently, these are Server 2019 systems in question. Sometime in the last month, some of the jobs which rely heavily on the &quot;run as user&quot; context to gain access to specific resources started failing. When taking a closer look at these failing jobs, it appears that they are no longer &quot;running as&quot; the user which they are assigned. They are failing in different ways, too -- for instance, one job uses SQL Server Integrated security to login and retrieve data from a SQL Server, others move files around to different servers and need to have specific access to access these shares. It&#x27;s all failing now.
 These aren&#x27;t new jobs, they&#x27;re ones which have been running successfully daily for years. I&#x27;ve done all the obvious things like tried to re-create the jobs with no avail. The jobs run fine if I run them manually under the context of the users they&#x27;re expected to run as, like starting powershell as the user, or logging into the system as the user. They just no longer run through Task Scheduler.
 My environment IS a subset of a larger Active Directory with AD Admins for the environment that do have management abilities like applying group policies and the such. When asking these admins if they&#x27;ve applied any security settings over the last month, I&#x27;ve been met with a lot of shrugs and &quot;I don&#x27;t think anything has changed&quot;. Of course, I can see the applied policies but have no idea which, if any, have been added or modified in the last 30 days or so.
 So, I&#x27;m reaching out here and asking if perhaps any of you folks might have an inkling on what could be going on, or if there might be a GPO setting you can think of that could have been turned on or modified that my effect the Task Scheduler in this way. I would be open to any thoughts to suggestions, as I feel like the ability to run a job as another user is a key feature in Task Scheduler and without it, it&#x27;s relatively useless.

                              <span>Hello all.
 I have the unfortunate task of trying to get a water damaged iPhone SE gen2 back up and running. Now the user has tried turning it on after letting it &quot;dry&quot; (not sure how long they left it) and my theory is that it wasn&#x27;t completely dry and it&#x27;s shorted something on the board. My question is does anyone know of places in the UK where they do full repairs of water damaged phones, I see places online but I am unsure of what they&#x27;re like. I don&#x27;t think my local repair shop will deal with water damaged phones but if anyone has dealt with this kind of thing before your insights would be useful! 
 Any help appreciated!

 I can access to the site on standard port 443 through https://0.0.0.0/ but https://0.0.0.0:10210/.
 I checked the log and it shows as below after timeout.
 60203 10.0.10.201 NONE_NONE/503 0 CONNECT 0.0.0.0:10210
 My conf is as below.
 acl SSL_ports port 443 10210
 http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
 ## When I just specify SSL_ports to only 443, I see logging
 ## 0 10.0.10.201 TCP_DENIED/403 2014 CONNECT 0.0.0.0:10210
 Can someone please help me to resolve the issue?
 Thanks

 I would like to know how to create a bootable USB with a Windows 10 reference image and boot it from a PC with secure boot enabled. I have seen that Rufus provides this, but cannot see any option when creating the bootable USB using Rufus.
 Thanks!

                              <span>hey
 for the longest time we used the office365 app to view office documents in our android workspaces as it didn&#x27;t neet a microsoft account - for some time, an account is required, though
 since then i&#x27;m looking for alternatives but have reached a point where i say that i can&#x27;t solve it on my own
 do you have recommendtions for a gdrpr compliant office viewer app that is ideally open source or free?
 i&#x27;ve used google docs etc in the past, but the app requires an account, too, as it seems.
 editing office documents would be a plus, but i&#x27;m primarily looking for a viewer
 thank you for every advice

 ​
 &quot;Its historical grown!&quot; - no its not. Its poorly documentend, planned and used for anything but the orginal intend
 &quot;We always did it this way&quot; + &quot;Why doesnt it work better?&quot; - because you always did it that way and if you finally migrate systems, you know the thing you actually employed me for we could actually be efficient
 &quot;Are we really needing that?&quot; - Im perfectly content with putting a typewriter up your desk instead if you want to
 &quot;Why is it so expensive?&quot; - because the last 5 years you invested 0 cents into any system now resulted in all systems beeing a dumpster fire instead of one at a time
 &quot;Could i get that fancy new Laptop for xyz person&quot; - Sure, but you know its not gonna work with the things you need to work because the system is so old that that new shiney System will cause it to have a stroke
 &quot;Why is my video quality sooo bad?&quot; - because i didnt get your approval to upgrade the system, funny how that turned out,right?
 &quot;So how quick can you learn to adminstrate at perfect level that 15 year old system your prior Admin supported and that is gone for 6 months and did it for the last 15 years?&quot; - How about ... never?

                              <span>So, heres a small story i experienced just 3 hours ago:
 Internet went down site-wide, checked everything from firewall to clients - everything working as intended. Router (in Bridge mode, Huawei Router issued by ISP) showing connected, but not passing through traffic.
 Calling them resulted from &quot;We don&#x27;t know what happened&quot; to &quot;We don&#x27;t care if you are a business customer&quot;. No word on how this will be fixed or when.
 Restored internet connectivity by integrating a fallback connection with same router but another provider (thankfully had everything physically set up, but planned configuring in a few days), but i am still so incredibly angry at all this. I pay them. They should respond according to SLA. At least i know it is an &quot;issue&quot; with them, not me - only thing they admitted after 7 calls. 
 What are your dumb vendor/ISP/contractor stories and how did you resolve it?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have been working at my current company for 2 years. Same time as one of my colleagues. This particular colleague is a “senior”. 
 Anyway this particular colleague is asking me for help with their tasks multiple times a day. I have tried my best to help them where I can without giving them direct instructions or answers, for example providing documentation or asking them questions to guide them to the answers in the hope that they will learn better that way. 
 However just lately I have felt drained by this, they continue to push and push till I’m basically at a point where I have to give them the answer else i won’t get any of my own work done.
 This week for example, they have taken a simple task in AWS which would take about 2/3 hour if you want to automate it with terraform (I don’t want to give too many specifics in case they are lurking). This job has now been going on for over a week still not completed it with almost daily questions about very basic things or asking to fix errors they are getting. To be clear this person has been working with terraform for almost 2 years at this point and was employed as a senior cloud engineer so it’s not like this person has just been dropped into something they shouldn’t or don’t understand.
 How is the best way of approaching this situation, I would like to get my time back and stop supporting this colleague so much. However, at the same time I don’t want to be considered unreasonable by refusing to help?
 Maybe I made this situation worse by helping in the first place I don’t know. I would appreciate other peoples thoughts on the matter and how to progress this situation.

                              <span>Hi!
 I have some issues with users coming from Windows 2012 R2, that they do not find the &quot;logoff/sign-out&quot; option.
 ​
 On Windows 2012, there is directly a &quot;logoff&quot;-button as standard for users.
 ​
 Do you have any idea on how to bring this back?
 ​
 Idea 1: Change default setting of &quot;on/off-button&quot; in start-menu to &quot;sign-out&quot;
 I tried this GPO, but without success: https://admx.help/?Category&#x3D;Windows_10_2016&amp;Policy&#x3D;Microsoft.Policies.StartMenu::PowerButtonAction
 ​
 Thank you for your thoughts

                              <span>Part of this cyber security initiative we&#x27;re undertaking involves removing unneeded privileges from users. Our helpdesk members had been given Global admin rights, which allowed them to reset user MFA when necessary.
 Now that they&#x27;ve lost the Global admin role, they don&#x27;t have this ability anymore.
 How is this done in other organizations? I feel like resetting MFA is something helpdesk should do, but I don&#x27;t think helpdesk should be M365 Global admins.

                              <span>Oh the things I love about working in IT. Two firewalls with hardware failure in less than a week&#x27;s time. One of those which the replacement arrive failed from the manufacturer. A sales rep that pushes to reschedule a meeting I had to move to work on the failed firewalls ASAP when I tell them I can&#x27;t promise timelines because I&#x27;m at the mercy of UPS so everything is tentative right now. Another sales rep that get&#x27;s upset because I hadn&#x27;t responded to an email he sent me saturday morning. I do sound a lighting as a side gig and had a show that loaded in at 10:30 am Saturday and I finally got home and in bed at 3 am Sunday. Woke up Sunday morning to monitoring alerts about the second failed firewall. Granted he didn&#x27;t know of that when he called today, but I also shouldn&#x27;t have had to explain to him multiple times I&#x27;d address that stuff once I finished working our firewall failures. So yea, I really love working in IT, the people and vendors make this profession so much fun.

 What are your experiences and recommendations?

                              <span>Why is MTU mismatch a problem in OSPF, I know we want matching MTU so that we can limit the size of LSU packets to an appropriate value to match the interfaces MTU but I’m thinking since LSUs are just IP packets cant the receiving router with lower MTU just fragment the packet if it receives a bigger LSU packet than it’s MTU?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at around 5 years of networking (7.5 years in IT) and my resume is like 1.2 pages long. This includes certifications, skills and technologies I work with, and education. It looks kind of busy and outdated though because it&#x27;s meant to be read properly by automated tracking systems. I have a fancy version that I think is much more aesthetically pleasing, but the text conversions on application sites aren&#x27;t super clean. I&#x27;m being told that I should be able to make mine one page long and very simple and short.
 I looked through this subreddit and some guy with 20+ years commented that his resume is 1 page long, and I also learned that Elon Musk&#x27;s resume is 1 page long. How does a network guy that needs to showcase experience with different protocols/projects even do that?
 My struggles come with trying to showcase a &quot;strong&quot; bullet that shows what you did, how you did it, what the impact was, and what the numbers are (people, costs, percentages, etc.) without making it more than 2 lines long.
 I&#x27;m also not sure if I should list prior IT helpdesk experience at other jobs to showcase my growth to try and make it shorter. Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello all, the company I am working at is attempting to redo our configuration for the front of our network. Currently we just have two ISPs that get routed into our firewall and the firewall itself does the load balancing and fail over. We are looking to move towards BGP and get a more seamless solution going. But I wanted to know is it worth doing high-availability on the BGP portion of the routing? Could this be done with MLAG on the isp and our new layer 3 switches? We currently have two Palo Alto‘s for redundancy at the head of our network. I was thinking of setting something up like the image attached below, but wanted to know how it really would work with having two different ASN‘scans what ones would be hosting the actual /24’s themselves. Thank you all so much in advance!

                              <span>I have a family restaraunt I do network work for, and they&#x27;re are switching POS systems. And they want a really redundant system. Would it be a good idea to have a sub router under the main router just in case the main one goes down? Or just get 1 very good router and run everything off of that? 
 The POS is able to process orders locally without internet, but if I had a single router setup, it wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that if it went down. 
 Or should I look at it as more failure points for 2 routers?

One thing I’ve noticed is we don’t have QoS implemented anywhere on our network. I work for large company with hundreds of stores across the country and multiple corporate offices. Is it normal for a company this size to not implement QoS?

                              <span>So like the title says, I am going to be in charge of building out some new infrastructure and it will need to be all 10GB.
 I have been having a surprisingly hard time finding good options for switches, they are either too small/consumer/Chinese or cisco + license requirements.
 Is there any middle ground? If not what are some good options? Ideally would like to keep it under $10k but if there is a good reason to spend more I am open to hearing it.
 We will need ~200 10GB rj45 ports eventually but starting off with a single 48 port should be good enough with at least a 40gb uplink, 100gb would be better.
 ​
 EDIT: More details.
 They will be connecting directly to servers via cat6/7 10gb connections. The actual networking setup will be really basic/simple.
 router &gt; 10gb switches via trunk lines &gt; servers
 The servers will only need to access the internet. In fact they will be fire walled and port isolated to ensure that is all they have access to on this network. Vlans will also be used.
 Thanks for any suggestions! Little out of my depth, first time swimming in this end of the pool.

 I&#x27;m a network engineer looking to get my hands dirty in the cloud space, as it pertains to networking solely (if that&#x27;s even a thing).
 I know absolutely nothing about cloud engineering so I was curious what some of you may recommend would be a good starting point to start learning. Do I go AWS, Azure, some other vendor? I learn best via videos so if there are any good beginner courses someone can recommend, i&#x27;d appreciate it.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I have a few sites connected via MPLS, with our address scheme being 10.1.0.0/26 for Site A, 10.2.0.0/16 for Site B and 10.3.0.0/16 for Site C. We use OSPF for our routing protocol.
 Recently I have noticed when I do a &quot;sh ip route&quot; on my core switches at any of the sites, there is some odd routes that appear there and I am wondering if anyone knows why these would be learned?
 Should I contact my ISP and inquire with them?
 Here is some excerpts of the weird routes in the routing table from Site A&#x27;s perspective:
 1.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets
 O E2 1.2.3.4 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254
 O E2 1.2.3.5 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254
 20.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
 O E2 20.20.20.0 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254
 172.25.0.0/22 is subnetted, 2 subnets
 O E2 172.25.8.0 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254
 O E2 172.25.12.0 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a 2540 as a core switch. It does L3 vlan routing.
 It&#x27;s connected to another 2540, and a bunch of 2530s.
 On the logs of the 2540 core, I&#x27;m seeing loads of 
  IPv4: Duplicate IPv4 address 192.168.2.254 is detected on port 1 in VLAN 30 with a MAC address of 104f58-e81420 (18 times in 60 seconds) 
 That mac address is the mac address of the core 2540, the 2.254 IP is part of a /30 subnet that connects to a firewall. (Port 10)
 The core 2540 is connected on port 1 to the other 2540. The other 2540 is just acting as a switch, routing is off. It has an IP on the management subnet.
 All switches have GVRP enabled. If I turn off GVRP on the non-core 2540, it fixes the problem. Why might this be? STP is off, there are no loops.
 What I typically see if pinging anything connected to the other 2540, is everything is fine for a while, 2-5 minutes, then pings drop for 5 seconds, and repeat.
 All the VLANS on the other 2540 are all statically configured, apart from two (vlan 100,200) which aren&#x27;t actually used for anything at all. They&#x27;re just configured VLANs.
 I must be not understanding how GVRP works, so any advice is welcome
 thanks

                              <span>EDIT: I found this on Ubiquiti&#x27;s website, but thought I&#x27;d leave this post up if someone searches with a similar problem. Not sure if it&#x27;s only Ubiquiti behind on upgrading all their hardware to the 48v standard or if other vendors mix their product lines as well.
 Setting up some Ubiquiti equipment and I wish they would settle on a single PoE voltage...
 I need 3 switches:
  
LAN + 1x 48v + 2x 24v
 LAN + 1x 24v + 1x 48v (Two of them)
  
I got their USW-Flex-Utility with the switch, but it&#x27;s 48v only. These setups are going outdoors and the only thing I found are a variation of this one, with a single LAN and 24v/48v out. Max wattage used would be around 30w.
 Tks in advance.

 I can ping and resolve DNS hostnames to these SMB file shares on VPN, only thing that doesn&#x27;t work is SMB access. Fortigate logs show correct policy being applied and traffic being approved.
 No success with run commands to full UNC path or IP address. I&#x27;ve tried mapping directly through explorer and prompting for login to try other domain accounts with no success.
 Min version of SMB on Fortigate is set to v1 and max ver is set to v3.
 I&#x27;ve allocated DNS servers for VPN clients to use same as domain.

                              <span>I am looking to buy this DIN rail mounted switch, https://www.fs.com/products/138511.html
 It does not ship with a power supply, I&#x27;ve confirmed with my rep. They don&#x27;t sell power supplies, also confirmed by my rep.
 The input voltage is 48-57VDC. Nothing is built out yet, but I plan on having this switch and power supply (along with fiber and copper) installed outside in a weatherproof enclosure. The copper/fiber will be ran separate from power, but I&#x27;m also having a 120v power outlet installed in this box. A DIN rail switch isn&#x27;t needed, but it would make the install cleaner. In a proper cabinet with all DIN rail mounted equipment there would also be an existing power source, but this is an isolated install.
 I think I can buy this and cut off the connector and wire the leads right into the green power plug on the switch.

 I&#x27;m starting in this sub making an assumption that there are network guys that have dealt with these types of installs.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I am facing the issue when devices do not accept DHCP offers in this scenario:
  
Client connects to wifi network. IP is assigned via DHCP. Lease time 30min
 User puts PC to sleep, walks to another floor.
 After some time (probbably when lease time is over) user wakes up PC from sleep
 PC sends DHCP discover requesting its previous IP
 DHCP server sends DHCP offer with different IP.
 PC discards offer provided from server with event viewer log message: Offer is discarded on the interface 42. Error code is 0x0
 PC sends another discover requesting the old IP.
  
...
 ​
 5,6,7 repeats all the time.
 This is not a single PC issue.
 ​
 I did a packet capture on PC and there are no DHCP reject packets or something more. Only discovers and offers.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea where to look at?
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Edit:
 Windows10 PC
 Fortigate acting as DHCP server

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 My company uses EIGRP for its core network routing and wants me to change it to OSPF.
 See below a diagram of our core network :
 https://prnt.sc/aZdl9T\_ae3qq
 We have 3 offices (BLUE / ORANGE / GREEN) which are interconnected and connected to the same ISP (RED).
 The core network of every office consists of one router and one MLS. We use 3 different EIGRP AS so that the router of each office gets its default route by the ISP and redistributes it in the other EIGRP AS with a higher cost to have redundancy if the link between one office and the ISP is down.
 I wanted to take advantage of this change to simplify my architecture by using one signle OSPF area. But I don&#x27;t know the best way to configure it. And that&#x27;s mainly because all the routers &amp; MLS are in the same VLAN meaning the OSPF cost from any core device to another is the same.
 Using multiple OSPF areas would probably work but I was wondering if you had better ideas.
 I&#x27;ve heard of the &quot;per-neighbor cost&quot; feature in OSPF but it isn&#x27;t 100% clear to me if it&#x27;s made for this kind of situations. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t try in because it isn&#x27;t supported in my &quot;simulation&quot; software.
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi,
 I have 2 new HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 servers. Both of these servers came with Broadcom BCM57414 network cards.
 Can any recommend a compatible third-party SFP 1Gb modules for these servers? HPE SFP modules are somewhat expensive.
 Note: these SFP 1Gb modules will connect to my Cisco 24-port 1GB unmanaged switch. I did recently purchase an HPE Aruba 6300M managed switch, but it hasn&#x27;t come in yet.

                              <span>So I have a Draytek Vigor 2866 device in my office that I want to connect to over the internet (using a 5G router from Three Network in the UK) and have setup two different types of VPN - SSL &amp; L2TP/IPSec.
 L2TP/IPSec works mostly without any issues but rarely have issues trying to connect as it gets stuck trying to dial into that VPN. I know it is old tech and would be more secure and stable to use SSL.
 SSL connects okay but gives me issues when I try to load anything, from a webpage to RDP connections are incredibly slow (does not even load most of the time). I&#x27;m not sure if it is an MTU issue but I&#x27;ve tried to set the MTU as low as 1000 and it still didn&#x27;t fix it for me.
 Earlier in the year when I switched to this ISP&#x27;s 5G internet connection, I had incompatibility issues with IPSec/ESP VPN connections for my wife so we got her to change to SSL VPN which worked just fine for her. I have a few other SSL VPN connections from the same laptop that work fine through this network so I&#x27;m not sure where to start with the debugging on this one. Appreciate any advice.
 P.S: I&#x27;m using Smart VPN Client from Draytek on my laptop to connect to the router.

                              <span>Hello, I try to configure a new aruba 6100 switch. (Lets call it Switch A)
 I configured an IP on the Vlan 1 and connected the switch A to another switch (Switch B) that outputs that Vlan 1 untagged. When I do so, every device connected to switch b cant communicate at all, get an apipa and so on. 
 Needless to say, I can&#x27;t reach the new Switch A via IP either. (Unless I connect the Lan directly to the switch and configure the gateway address to the switch managment IP)
 When I disconnect Switch A from Switch B, everything is fine again.
 Configuration Switch A:

                              <span>After migrating the Enterprise CA to a new datacenter, I cannot reissue the certificates. The only certificates showing are from the list of default built-in certificates. I do see all the certificate templates when I go to the Manage view to see all certificates, but I just don’t see them listed as an option to issue.
 The CA has connectivity with the domain controllers at the new site. Is there any reason it also needs connectivity with the DCs at the old site or would this be a different issue?

 Are there specific requirements for running ethernet outside a wall or ceiling? I&#x27;m running ethernet under tables that are perpendicular to the wall.
 FWIW, there&#x27;s no POE: they&#x27;re just going from an access switch to desktop clients.

After it is restarted the password can only be changed once then it will say it doesn’t meet the complexity requirements no matter how complex it is. Anyone know what’s happening? I have tried changing the password policies and confirmed it has changed but it’s still not working.

 Is there a proper term for this person, other than lazy POS?

 Well they were much more than pissed off. They made degrading remarks about my work (or according to them lack-there-of) and basically shoo-ed me like a 5 y.o. I standed there baffled for a minute then proceeded to tell them that this was no way to talk to a coworker and that I had actually some work to do that needed their input.

                              <span>Past several months we have seen, heard or experienced outages from major vendors. Yet, it&#x27;s not in the news or even publicly acknowledged. While most would point fingers at state actors but it could also be a BSOD, patch etc 
 Whatever the case, it&#x27;s becoming extremely critical to have a proper plan B and not rely on these massive clouds. Imagine if Microsoft goes down for a couple of days.. no emails no banking etc etc 
 What&#x27;s your plan B?

 So this facility recently fell in my lap because I was placed on leave without pay from my day job. I&#x27;m lucky that this will pay my bills. The place is a mess. I&#x27;m doing my best though. My first order of business was installing remote access software, uBlock Origin, and Virus scans.
 We have a NEC 5800 server onsite that is only running the DHCP role and Server 2012 R2. Upgrading the OS is on my list first. That being said, it has 16 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage, but there is room to expand although this server is running out of time, imo. This site has literally nothing hosted on pre…</span>

 The account has a good password (reset recently) and MFA set correctly.
 We have Azure AD identity protection enabled too.
 Any way to stop this from happening? Other than changing the UPN?

 Is something like &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; enough of a representation or should there more? 
 I&#x27;m aware of the standard definition of SSO - but while $currentJob is still growing - I&#x27;m looking for more information on what I should look out for before reviewing sign ups to expensive enterprise plans.

 About to ugprade our vcenter from 6.7 to 8.0u1b (latest release) but was wondering if it is compatible with our hosts running esxi 6.7 (to be upgraded to 8.0 after upgrading vcenter...)
 I checked the interoperability matrix chart on vmware site and they seem to be compatible but just want a sanity check before upgrading.
 ​
 Anyone ran vcenter 8 with their hosts still being on 6.7?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;re configuring a new proxy server for BYOD traffic. Windows clients detect the proxy settings by using DHCP option 252 to get the WPAD file, but neither Android or IOS support this.
 Anyone know what the options are? Outbound traffic is blocked on ports 80 and 443, and when the proxy is entered manually on Android and IOS it all works correctly. We&#x27;re just missing the auto detection piece.
 Any advice gratefully received!

                              <span>Client got ransomware. Have fully restored server environment from backups. Would like all the &quot;new&quot; servers to be named differently since we want to retain old backups with DC01, but begin backing up the restored server as DC02. It is the only Domain Controller in the environment. Is there a way to do this?

                              <span>Morning / Afternoon all,
 Anyone know why my Azure AD Joined devices can suddenly no longer print to our printers installed on a print server?
 We went through all this crap during the Print Nightmare fiasco, but in the last few weeks my users have been getting the generic error of: Windows cannot connect to the printer: Error 0x0000011b.
 Our domain joined devices have no issue.
 All users who are using an Azure AD joined device have AD / O365 synced accounts, so are using &#x27;SSO&#x27; with on prem resources. Never had issues before.
 The only fix I have found at the moment is creating the following key on the print server: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled and setting it to 0 - but I am almost certain that this then introduces the print nightmare vulnerability again.
 What gives? Anyone else had the same issues? None of the recently installed patches seem to be causing this, I&#x27;ve uninstalled them all from a users device and the print server...

                              <span>A couple months ago I figured out my company was doing some miscalculations when we sold our software. We service a non-technical industry, so for certain customers we will essentially set them up a VM in an isolated Vnet, install their apps, and let them connect in to use the software and do their order processing, accounting, or whatever. A &quot;We handle it all&quot; type of sales package.
 This week I dug in more and unfortunately, they were licensing these based on CAL model (per employee of our customer) even though there is also an external website component (Public facing store for order entry). This means you need core-based licensing as I understand it.
 Even though there&#x27;s only a few non-compliant systems, 24 cores at ~3K each is going to be a pretty big problem when I bring it up. And I don&#x27;t think the company plans to change their business model. Well this sucks.

                              <span>I singed up for a trial for P2 licensing. I then signed up to P1 as well just to see some differences. So far I haven&#x27;t seen any differences when both licenses are assigned to different users in our tenant. Does this mean that if I have a mix of P1 and P2 licenses, I will reap the benefits of the P2 license at least in the management portion (devices discover, inventory, etc)? Or am I missing something?

                              <span>We use Phoenix Druva to back-up our VM infrastructure. This application offers different restore scenarios: file/folder restore, full vm restore, restore using sandbox. See: https://docs.druva.com/Phoenix/030_Configure_Phoenix_for_Backup/010_Backup_and_Restore_VMware/040_Restore_Virtual_Machines/080_File_Level_Restore
 We want to do monthly restore testing, how would you organize the tests? Would you rather restore a single file, or restore the complete VM? Or restore in a sandbox scenario? In an ideal world, I would like to automate this as much as possible. Their API doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any restore capabilities. You can only restore to original location, but I don&#x27;t want to interrupt the live VM. See: https://developer.druva.com/reference/restoreoriginalrequest-1
 So I guess this will be a monthly manual action. Looking for your opinions how you would approach this.

 How do you handle patch management of VMware Workstation Pro?
 My 3rd party patch management solution refuses to patch it because it requires a license. Intune with chocolatey/winget doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. Perhaps I am doing it wrong. How do you guys handle it?

                              <span>It&#x27;s very late, and I&#x27;ve hit a roadblock in my plans to decommission an old Domain Controller as I&#x27;ve found the old admin has installed an Enterprise Root CA on it as well... Essentially, I still need to update this machine to Server 2022, but I also need to keep the CA in place, at least for now.
 I think the easiest path forward is as follows, but wanted to seek advice incase I&#x27;m missing something obvious as I&#x27;ve never dealt with a CA before.
 Prep so far:I have moved FSMO roles to a new DC, I have also spun up an extra DC to replace this one and put them in place as new DNS servers.
 Planned steps:
  
Take a CA backup, including the root certificate, Private Key etc.
 Remove AD CS from old DC
 Demote old DC
 Remove the old server from the domain
 Install Windows Server 2022 fresh with the same name as the old server; join it to the domain. 6. Install AD CS using existing root certificate and CA settings. 7. Restore the CA backup on the new server.
  
Am I missing anything critical? Seems like the CA is only issuing some certs for Directory Services, LDAPS and some intranet sites, so I&#x27;m not sure how essential it is but that&#x27;s a problem for after I get rid of all the other 2012R2 VMs.
 Thanks in advance for any tips!

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 We have around 15 workstations and 2 printers on the second floor. We recently bought two (2) new workstations and noticed that neither of them were getting any signal from the ethernet/switch (computer said no ethernet cable connected). I troubleshooted it for a while and noticed that every time I disabled the ethernet adapter, the lights on the ethernet port starting to show some data. To me, this seem like a driver or Windows issue so I updated the drivers using the latest one from the MB&#x27;s website with no success. I also clean installed Windows and no success.
 One thing I did notice is that they would get internet if the connection was bridged. For example, our VoIP phones have a PC port. When bringing a cable from the VoIP port, the computer would get internet. I also tried with a 5 port switch and it actually worked too. It seems that the issue is when connected directly to the wall.
 When I noticed that everything worked when not plugged directly to the wall, I started to mess around the connection on the switch and no matter what I did the issue was always there. What seems strange to me is that no other workstation that are already there present similar issue. I even connected the computer to one port that was already working for someone else and the PC will not recognize the ethernet cable.
 I grab the computers and brought them to a different floor and they work fine when connected directly to the wall. This makes me think that it could be a switch related issue. This is the first time I come across something like this in my work experience. I have called a couple of friends who were also clueless on what could be the issue.
 Any advise will be greatly appreciated!!

I feel that much of the anger from our recent decision around the downstream sources comes from either those who do not want to pay for the time, effort and resources going into RHEL or those who want to repackage it for their own profit. This demand for RHEL code is disingenuous. 
  
I mean, fair enough. We &#x27;bought in&#x27; to the RHEL ecosystem, running Centos in prod, and now were moving to Alma. We had a few RHEL support contracts for &quot;key&quot; servers, but mostly stuck with the open source options, and found that having an easy &#x27;move-to-prod&#x27; road was of some value. 
 Shooting down Alma, Rocky, Oracle Linux and Centos all at once though? Well, I guess that&#x27;s a pretty solid &#x27;F you&#x27; and we&#x27;ll now have to review our options. I guess this might drive some license fees out of us, but it might as easily push us to &#x27;never RedHat&#x27;. Going to have to have some internal discussions about that.

                              <span>How does everyone force updates on users devices?
 We use IBM MaaS 360 for mobile devices and InTune for Windows/IOS devices, problem is we have what we believe to be forced updates turned on but during our Cybersecurity internal audits we are finding people are still not on the current OS&#x27;s?
 Could it be something within a policy that is allowing them to not update/not pushing out the updates? 
 We have changed the window for updating from 9 days to instant and have auto updates on for IOS but we&#x27;ve had to manually call users and walk them through updating.
 Any extra add-ons/management tools people use to ensure devices are updated as soon as possible?
 Thankyou for any suggestions/help!!

                              <span>Filling in timesheets is not #1 priority, nor should it ever be (but it is in your shitshow of a company, isn&#x27;t it?)
 
We use your timesheets to track the progress of the project. Then fucking don&#x27;t. Pay for purpose-built tools (that you use the free tier of) you cheap shits and track the project there.
 
You should keep your timesheets as correct as possible, we encourage sticking to 30 minute intervals or less. Wait untill you see 3 hours a week for &quot;time teacking&quot;, we&#x27;ll see how your tone will change.
 
We want to understand any painpoints you may have with time tracking. Really? How about allowing any kind of extension that would let me import my meetings? Oh, you have to pay for the premium tier of the software? Fuck me then.
 
These are our company policies and we do ask you to follow them. Yeah, well, not for long now. I have my resignation ready, just need to fill in a date.
 Bonus one: wait untill those dipshits hear that I know they broke the labour laws where I&#x27;m at. Oh, what a fun &quot;exit interview&quot; that&#x27;s going to be.
 
 And again, FUCK YOU. 
 For anyone that read my previous rant about this hellhole - yes, they are still very proud of the $20 they give us each month for pizza

 I&#x27;ve been dealing with this for a few hours. Azure VPN Client version 3.1.2.0 may cause your users to drop their Point-to-Site tunnel on an hourly interval. 11:22, 12:22. 13:22 etc. Microsoft replied to a thread here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1317410/azure-p2s-vpn-client-disconnects-exactly-every-hou 
 The workaround right now is to downgrade the client to version 2.2159.179.0.

 ​
 I am having some issues at the minute where when users start outlook for the first time it is using the local domain instead of our email domain. For exmaple, harry.local instead of harry.co.uk
 ​
 I don&#x27;t think we can use autodiscover as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to setup the DNS entries. Is there any other way I can do this via a script or GPO? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 My boss wanted me to implement OneDrive to all users and he&#x27;s asking me if the following is possible. 
 - Prevent File Deletion In the Folders(Desktop,Documents,Pictures) that are being backed up by OneDrive 
 - Prohibit Any Files Transfer from the Above mentioned 3 Folders to any other locations of the User&#x27;s PC which is not being backed Up by OneDrive 
 - For IT Admins to Receive notifications when User&#x27;s Storage Quota is going to be full. 
 For me it seems weird for the first two requirement... but yeah if anyone can enlighten me, will be excellent :) 
 PS: MS Support said that GPO is possible for the first two criteria and MS Flow for the last.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve inherited a domain where I guess lots of different sysadmins have built their own servers over the years and now we have this crazy mishmash of naming conventions.
 Something simple like a Domain Controller I can just rebuild, but something like WSUS, MDT or our door system takes a lot more effort so I&#x27;m thinking... could I just get away with just renaming them on DNS? Or is that what you would consider to be &quot;bad practice&quot;?
 Or can Windows and Linux (Ubuntu) servers generally survive a rename these days without causing a ruckus on the network/domain?

                              <span>I look after the computers of a company that has 80 staff. The company has experienced a lot of growth and have effectively doubled in size in 2/3 years. They have high staff retention, and there are people there who have been there since the late 90&#x27;s/early 00&#x27;s. 
 IT today is different to what it was then, and a lot of the time the battles I face are with these more established members of staff who moan every single change we make to the IT. The most recent IT change was establishing Intune and a few changes in regards to desktop backgrounds and windows updates. A lot of them hit the roof when we set a default desktop background, demanding it be changed back on &quot;their computer&quot;. A polite reminder that the computer&#x27;s belong to the company and aren&#x27;t personal devices stopped that.

 I&#x27;m currently working on automating a task and I could really use your help with the task planner. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to achieve: I want to set up a trigger that activates whenever a file is received via SFTP on a server.
 Basically, I&#x27;m looking for a way to create a trigger or find a workaround that can detect when a file arrives via SFTP. This trigger will be used to initiate a specific action or process.
 Do any of you have experience with this or know of any tools or methods that could help me accomplish this? I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights you can provide.
 TL;DR: Need assistance with setting up a trigger for my task planner that activates when a file is received via SFTP on a server. Looking for suggestions or workarounds.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

                              <span>I have some users experiencing &quot;lag&quot; and hangs whilst loading some of their documents from sharepoint (Esp large Excel docs) and found this guide on microsoft&#x27;s site.
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/performance/office-slow-or-stop-responding
 ​
 I can only Imagine that it&#x27;s Caching an offline version of the file temporarily until it can reconnect to their SP sites.
 Has anyone who&#x27;s tried this ever experienced any Syncing issues?
 Or if there&#x27;s anyone that could shed some light on how applying this registry change works and what it does, that would be amazing.
 It seemed to fix the issue for the one user I could run the workaround on, but I&#x27;m skeptical that it can be applied as a blanket fix for the whole site without causing issues with Sync, especially if multiple users are working on the document at once.

 We already got network address 1.1.1.0/8 for some swiches.
 Will it be properly connected to the internet? Or will name resolution be performed within the LAN?

 It&#x27;s spamming my CLI roughly every 10 seconds.
 I&#x27;ve just completed the switch setup guide on https://www.blackwiredesigns.com (including a factory reset and the SSL Cert Generate) but this message was persistent through the whole process.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am in search for a muti-vendor networking monitoring and mapping solution. Based on reading LLDP, CDP, STP, ARP tables, and other useful information from SNMP, the goal would be that the platform would map out a multi-vendor network. Then based on the mapping and links, the monitoring rules would create device dependencies and alarm rollups automatically
 Example, if 24 PoE access points are connected to a poe switch, and the the switch becomes unreachable, I would only want to see 1 alarm showing because the switch is down all 24 APs are also down. I wouldn&#x27;t want to see 25 separate alarms.
 I know this is a function of many nms platforms, but which does it the best in a multi-vendor network? I know Meraki or even Ubiquiti does it well when it&#x27;s all one brand of equipment, but most networks are multi vendor environments that seem to break things horribly. Looking for suggestions other then draw visio diagrams and create the dependencies yourself scenarios!

                              <span>Hey all, I’ve come across a request where we are attempting to create a test shelf where a number of devices would be plugged in at the same time to be diagnosed and troubleshot/repaired. Once the machine is done it would be replaced with another machine and so on. The ask is that each slot on the shelf correlate to an ip address so that there is no confusing which machine is which. After doing some thinking and research the most plausible solution I could come up with was creating a different vlans for each network port with short lease times on a dhcp scope of 1 IP. Was looking here to see if anyone else has done something similar or if there is another way. 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello Reddit, 
 I am looking for some advice from individuals who definitely know more then me. 
 I work for a small business and I am trying to help improve the network for security purposes. Currently we run the Meraki Go system in our 4 locations. It leaves a lot to be desired. The other day the firewall in one location had a port failure and their app never showed us that was the issue. We discovered it when we switched the ethernet cable from one port to the other. I find that defeats the purpose. It should clearly have shown me this was happening, but still it does not tell me there is a port failure. In the end, I just feel this system is not developed enough and I want to move on. 
 I considered Barracuda, Palo Alto and Fortinet, but honestly, their price point, the business owner will not go for it. Not even close. 
 Then I discovered Firewalla, its a lot closer to what I want, especially with the VPN system and MSP they have, but their yearly subscription really makes a reasonably priced product and decently expensive product. 
 I thought I would pose this question to the /reddit world. Any alternative solutions I should look at, that may provide a solution that is better than meraki go, but more reasonable then firewalla. Or if Firewalla really is the real deal and I should sell my boss. Or, alternative solutions. 
 Thanks for your time guys. 
 Colin

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;m in a bit of a dead-end and was wondering if anyone here has any ideas. I know this is EOL hardware, but unfortunately that&#x27;s what we have...
 Here is my saga: I have a Cisco 3750X-24P-L which I want to stack with a 3750-48P-S
 The reason I need to stack these is, apart from port density, the fact that the 3750X has PoE+ and a 10G uplink.
 The challenges:
 The 3750-48P-S can only run IOS 12, since it only has 16mb of internal flash, and IOS15 doesn&#x27;t fit.
 The 3750X-24P-L is originally licensed with lanbase, which doesn&#x27;t allow it to stack with non-lanbase switches. If I upgrade it to IOS15, I&#x27;m able to activate the RTU license and have it boot ipservice or ipbase, which would allow me to stack, but you can&#x27;t stack IOS12 with IOS15.
 In IOS 12, I don&#x27;t seem to be able to activate a RTU license, even with a &quot;universal&quot; image.
 In IOS12 it seems you can activate a 90day trial license of ipservices, I&#x27;ve tried that, but it seems my 90 days were already used. (These switches are old, before I worked here, and someone might have activated the trial in the past).
 I have tried formating the flash to see if the trial resets, or even changing the date, but no luck.
 Considering these switches are EOL and EOS, is there any other alternative? The famous website where Cisco would allow you to generate keys seems to have been long gone.

 I know what a VLAN is and how to configure it on a switch. ie put ports into vlans etc.
 How does one associate and entire network range to a vlan ie lets say 172.17.18.xxx belong to vlan 1718? where does that get configure. I am new to networking and sorry for this silly question. Any help you are able to provide is greatly appreciated.

 Thank you

                              <span>Hello, I am setting up our new hyperglass and adding devices to the devices.yaml file for the first time.
 When testing with flask, I try to ping any address. but I get the following error:
 router1 is an invalid location
 I have tested the username and password and they work.
 Here is my anonymized devices.yaml:
 routers:
 - name: router1
 address: 1.5.2.1
 network:
 name: PRODUCTION
 display_name: AS65004
 username: hyperglass
 password: correct
 port: 22
 nos: cisco_xr
 vrfs:
 - name: global
 default: true
 ipv4:
 source_address: 1.5.3.1
 ipv6:
 source_address: ::fffe::1
 Surprisingly when I change name to name: New York City, NY , I don&#x27;t get an invalid location but I get an authentication error(even though IP address and credentials are valid.

                              <span>I have an opportunity to work for Cisco TAC supporting ASA and ISE. I’m wondering if anyone else here has? 
 Are they going to grind me to dust within months? I can handle the stress of being up to bat and expected to hit a home run. 
 But what’s the culture like? Are your peers helpful?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I hope someone has some information on this, or can point me in the right direction 
 I have tons of multimode fiber strand between two rooms on different floors (100+) via a LC OM4 patchpanel
 I have a switch in each room I want to link up with 100GbE optics. My gut is: 1) take a qsfp28 2) put a MTP breakout on it 3)Plug it into the patch panels 4) reverse it on the other end.
 It seems too simple though, I know polarity can be a thing the trunk lines are setup such that port 1 goes to port 1, 2 to 2 ...etc
 But then would i get away with an 8 strand breakout? Or would I need a 12 strand breakout?
 I created a little.diagram, I&#x27;ve attached if it helps anyone visualize this.....

 The ability to run new cables (MTP or realistically SMF) is not really an availability at this time, especially when the cabling exists already and is under utilized.
 If any

 Forgot to mention switches

 Could you provide me with some comments? I&#x27;ve been working as a network engineer for five years, specializing in routing and switching. I also have some experience with SDWAN. I&#x27;m contemplating a transition into the security field, specifically focusing on Firewalls/NetSec. Do you believe it&#x27;s still a worthwhile endeavor to pursue? Am I potentially late to the game? Alternatively, should I redirect my attention towards other areas such as cloud or automation? Thank you in advance for your insights!

                              <span>I got a bit of a Problem understanding the following issue:
 {Azure VM}
  
   
  
 [HQ]&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[BR1]
 BR1 is connected to HQ with its own Fibre connection and on top a IPSEC Connection to encrypt the Data.
 BR1 Clients are using RDP to connect to a Azure VM which is only reachable through HQ.
 ​
 We do have connection Issues with Clients tho. If we set Clients MTU to 1432 everything works. But ofc we do experience overall Performance Issues with that MTU.
 ​
 Why is that the case and how do I approach this the right way ?

 I am running two Cisco XRv9000 virtual machines in a VMware host environment. They were both instantiated from the same existing virtual machine template.
 The whole environment is multivendor and is running LLDP for neighbor discovery. Now when i look at LLDP neighbors on a machine connected to both XRv9000 VMs, i can see them overwriting each others entry, because they both have the same Chassis ID.
 Can the Chassis ID be changed on a XRv9000 virtual machines so i would avoid this behaviour with LLDP ?

                              <span>Hey guys, I have a question on how I should approach the title.
 I&#x27;m setting up a new terminal server which will allow users access to a number of internal networks at work from the company&#x27;s wan.
 I have 2 layer 2 networks that are exact copies of each other, for example the server on 10.0.0.1 is 10.0.0.1 on both networks, with the same function, etc.
 If I just connect the server to both I of course can&#x27;t control on which network from which interface I&#x27;ll reach a specific ip, so I need to translate the way my server sees one of the 10.0.0.0/24 networks to 10.0.1.0/24.
 What would be the best way to do it? I thought of putting a pfsense machine betweek the server and one network, set up 250 subinterfaces on it, then set those as 1:1 nats. That sounds a bit overkill and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better way out there to solve this &quot;simple&quot; case of &quot;i want this network part of the ip to become that, leave the host octet as it is&quot;
 Any help greatly appreciated!!
 Also the way we have it now is with an internal vswitch that has no uplinks, and another vm connected to it- we remote into it and then access the network in a regular way

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 We are currently facing a design issue with our Azure Expressroute setup, specifically with BGP between Microsoft (MS) and our Fortinet solution. Our setup involves two connections (two VLANs) from the firewall to Azure, and we have decided against using ECMP for various reasons. Therefore, we require an Active-Passive setup.
 For normal operation, we have successfully configured the Active-Passive setup using path prepending and local preference to determine the appropriate connection. When one of the peers goes down, failover occurs without any issues.
 However, we have encountered a problem during maintenance activities. If Azure initiates maintenance on the primary link, the BGP neighborship remains active, but traffic cannot flow through the connection. Before starting maintenance, MS pre-pends the primary connection. Unfortunately, since we rely on local preference, this pre-pending does not resolve the issue, as the local preference takes precedence over the prepending value.
 We have been attempting to collaborate with the Azure side (another IT supplier) to consistently pre-pend the secondary connection. This would allow us to eliminate the dependency on local preference. However, it seems that Azure does not support this configuration.
 Are there others who have experienced similar issues? We would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this challenge. Unfortunately, we have limited options since MS does not terminate the BGP neighborship during maintenance.
 Thank you for your assistance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m configuring a Dell PowerStore T series, and using Dell S series switches to link them. I have switches linked together via MC-LAG. Dell says each node on the power store should have the two ports configured as LACP. There&#x27;s two VLANs for the data traffic for redundancy, so how do I need to configure the port group that is connected to each node? Do I need to have the port group set for trunking with both VLANs used for the data network? Sorry if this is a dumb question, I&#x27;m not a full time network engineer.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been buying Prolabs transceivers for a couple years because they were advertises as being coded for juniper and Cisco, we&#x27;re moving from Cisco to juniper.
 They all show up as non juniper on our gear. But work. 
 I recently got some qsfp cables coded for Juniper only, and bam, no ugly hardware messages. 
 These folks only make direct attach cables though.
 So will fs com stuff show up not ugly if used on juniper?
 Bonus question: do they have ones that are compatible with Dell/EMC/Compellant?

What am I missing here? Is there something about aggregation that changes how CIDR is done?

                              <span>Situation: Hey all, i&#x27;ve spent way too much time on this and need some help. I am entry/Jr level in terms of networking so please forgive me if I get something wrong or make a bad assumption.
 I&#x27;m using a network emulator to emulate data traffic for load testing in the near future. It&#x27;s connected to a L3 switch that I&#x27;m sending the data TO and the goal (for now) is to simply be able to route the data back to the switch.
 The emulator and the switch are in an isolated environment where only the management ports/console are connected to the network. I have an ethernet cable going from port 2 on the emulator to port 1 on the switch.
 ultimate goal right now is sending a simple ICMP ping. The pcap is port captured data from the eth interface in the emulator. It shows:

                              <span>Hey there, I put this as design since Layer 3 switching is basically routing and I&#x27;m speaking in theories here so nothing to troubleshoot yet. I hope I chose right. 
 Here&#x27;s my scenario: I was provisioned /30 (Comcast calls this the Layer 3 IP Information) and a /29 (Customer Usable IP Information) provided by Comcast for fiber circuit and I need to install a switch at my headquarters. Their Juniper Switch is the last devices within their responsibility and has one port configured to give my switch .102 in the /30.
 I&#x27;m getting a Layer 3 switch eventually but I&#x27;d like to bring this circuit up sooner (back order).
 Here are some questions:
  
Do I need to use a Layer 3 switch or can I just use an unmanaged switch and configure the adapters on the things I plug in like my voice appliance and my firewall? 
 I have a layer 3 switch available with some open ports. Can I segment those ports into a different VLAN? I&#x27;m not totally sure how to do this but I think it can be done.
  
Thanks!

I would love to learn and implement newer more exciting tech, but I&#x27;m too busy with boring projects and putting out fires. It feels like a new job will be the same as the old job. I feel like to need to start my own business or get out of tech completely. Any thoughts are appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, so I&#x27;m at the start of migrating traffic over to an entirely new outbound pair of Palo Alto 3220&#x27;s. Tonight I migrated over one of our lower end environments across to them, all went fine, security rules worked great etc.. the main issue was around a NAT rule I wanted to use for each environment, basically, we have a public address ranges that our WAN external firewalls sit on and an entirely different /27 public routed range that isn&#x27;t on the same subnet etc.. this range is used on the current t ASA solution for certain environments, I wanted to use the free ones and migrate the ones in use across to the PA&#x27;s in the end. To begin with I was using a free public address in this routed range to put on this environment along with a catch-all PAT to the outside interface as an alternative. Currently during my testing on one of my test vm&#x27;s, the outside PAT works fine, however, when I turned on the source NAT to this free public address tonight, traffic dropped and stopped on my test VM! I have no clue why. The rule itself is setup like this:
 Scr zone : inside Dst zone : Internet Scr add : lower end environment range Dst add : any Scr translation : dynamic-ip-and-port to the public ip address object which is a /32 Dst translation: none
 Can someone tell me if I&#x27;m missing something here on the PA&#x27;s? The NAT rule, security rule where both being hit on the counter and I could see the NAT sessions being natted to the routed public address as well on the CLI. Could it just be something the other end with our PE router providers?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, so I&#x27;m in the middle of putting together an options paper for 3 lots of firewalls, one of which will be the one selected for the job. 
 First being Palo Alto (my preferred choice), they just WORK, is the best way I can sum it up, experience with them and don&#x27;t need to upskill on them when time is an issue too
 Firepower (more of management preference because its Cisco), I have more experience with Firepower which is precisely why I won&#x27;t be going for them, but they&#x27;re something to put down on the paper, so...🤷🏻‍♂️
 Third and final option to fill the last option will be Ciscos SD-WAN ISR router application/layer 7 firewall features. We use the SD-WAN side of things, but I wouldn&#x27;t know where to start with the firewall features of them. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a non starter, purely because of time that is available to me, how do they perform under stress or normal load using an SSL proxy, and normal firewall rule processing? It&#x27;s a router first and foremost and shouldn&#x27;t be used as a firewall if we don&#x27;t have to, simple as essentially. But I&#x27;m curious to know if others have used them for this purpose and what their experiences have been?
 The Palo I&#x27;ll end up getting in probably won&#x27;t need more than 1Gb interfaces as well to be honest, if that helps in terms of bandwidth

                              <span>I have a Cisco Switch running 17.10.01 and when I run a sync, it saves the usual stuff, but now I see a &#x27;nvram_config&#x27; file. I also do not see a config.text or anything similar. Can someone help me restore the switch using the nvram_config file?
 I know this has to be possible because if you do a write erase and delete this file on the flash: and then put the USB back in, it will do something with the nvram_config and bring back the configuration. But I am wondering if it is possible to do an inlace restore. 
 Is there a place I can find this information?

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 Recently I have been playing with python in an attempt to automate some things in our heterogenous and rather large network.
 So far I&#x27;ve been running all scripts locally on my machine, but I would like to share these with my team and also schedule some tasks overnight, when my laptop is asleep.
 So I was thinking of setting up a dedicated linux VM to host and run all the scripts. I would also like to integrate this with some git repository, so I can code on my machine and then push the revised scripts to this server while keeping track of any changes.
 How do you run python automation in your organization? What are some best practices you would recommend? 
 Thank you!

 For example I can describe relationship between IGP and iBGP as such that iBGP depends on reachability information provided by IGP in order to form BGP sessions where BGP speakers can then exchange their own NLRI. In the same ligh what does RSVP/OSPF provide to each other?

 And I want iterate throu them to gather their model and software version.
 Problem is I don&#x27;t have the device_type info, just their hostnames/IPs
 I tried using the netmiko SSHDetect module but it looks like it only detects when it&#x27;s a Cisco device.
 I ended up writing a convoluted script that... Basically if a connection fails due to wrong device type, I have it try another device type. It works but it&#x27;s messy.
 I was wondering if there&#x27;s a better way to get the device type info from a list of network devices with just their IPs/hostnames

 If specific routes have unkown and IGP origin codes, then what will be the origin code of aggregate address (as-set is appended on aggregated router).
 I did some lab work and I can see only unknown(?) Origin code is inherited from individual routes.
 I know we can change attributes of summarized address with attribute-map I am just wondering why unknown origin code is inherited by default any reasons for this?

                              <span>We are doing cloud backups to Wasabi using Veeam.
 Since the backups are big I want to use our 1Gbps ISP line to send the data to Wasabi.
 So wasbi is using our Veeam server as its gateway so I set a route in our sonicwall to let the Veeam server use the 1gbps ISP as its gateway out to the internet.
 After doing this I am not seeing much of a speed increase in Download but I do see a difference in the upload. 70Mbps Down 200Mbps Up. Compared to the 40Mbps Down 44Mbps Up on our normal ISP line.
 If I do a speed test directly from our WAN switch I get close to 1Gbps.
 The speed is causing 2 issues, the backups don’t complete during the backup window we give it if we let the backups run after the backup window we get reports from users that the VPN is slow. After stopping the backups the VPN speed is much better.
 A bit green here and hoping for some guidance on optimizing this.
 Thank you in advance for any input

                              <span>Hello All,
 Im trying to set up lag on the TP-SG3452XP.
 I have connected Port 50 and 51 together using the switch setup page, Each port was tested and connected on there own before I connected them together without issue.
 Now they have connected and the adapters in the windows network setting have been connected together as a bridge.
 My issue is that the switch seems to not like what I have done.

 Any hints on what I might have missed?
 Or anything else you need to understand what I am trying to do?

 Edit;
 PC has a 4 port NIC (X710-T4)

                              <span>Hi,
 i have few folders on my laptop (mostly arduino code) that i would want to keep safe from fire/being stolen. I have second pc in basement that is used almost daily, so buying nas seems non worth investing.
 I want to automatically copy selected folders from one pc to selected folder in other pc, whenever something was changed and both pc are currently in the same network. Is there way to do this? 
 One pc is using win7 and second one win10. 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry for such easy question, but i can only find information how to share folders or how to build real nas from pc.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m dealing with a very weird setup at the moment and I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s possible so I thought I&#x27;d ask here.
 I have an old phone system working off of PSTN, it has 2 line ports which ordinarly go to phone line ports.
 The customers want to go onto VOIP so we&#x27;ve got a Cisco ATA 191 registered to Voiceflex, my question was would there be a way of using this Cisco ATA 191 phone ports for the Line 1 &amp; 2 ports on the PBX?
 I know its a weird ask but I thought i&#x27;d check here, in theory (and in my head) it should work straight away, I have tried it and the Cisco ATA 191 thinks the phone ports (plugged into the line ports) are &quot;off the hook&quot;.
 Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this before / know if its possible even?

                              <span>Yesterday, while looking for a Network TAP, I came across a so-called M12 TAP .
 However, I have never seen these M12 connectors anywhere; and I have been working in IT for over 20 years.
 Are they relatively new or are they only used for veeeery specific special applications?
 I know it says they are mainly used in industrial applications, but I have never seen them there either...
 Thank you for any enlightenment.

                              <span>Can anyone recommend a test kit that will generate traffic and record the throughput at least every second and generate a pdf result graph? Preferably EXFO but not bothered either way. I can do Y.1564 tests till the cows come home but my EXFO Netblazer only show the average/high/low in the results. You can see the live speeds in the results page but it only records errors in the log. TIA.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked on this two days now and can&#x27;t make any progress on what is going on.
 I have an outbuilding linked by an Aerohive wireless bridge. The outbuilding bridge AP is linked to a switch, which has two APs (also Aerohive) broadcasting the access SSIDs. All VLAN 1. If I connect to any of the access SSIDs, I get DHCP, pings, internet access, all good. But if I connect to the switch, nothing. No DHCP. No pings to gateway or other devices even when I have a valid manual IP address on the subnet. 
 So maybe the switch is being weird? Nope, put in a new switch, exact same behavior.
 So I thought, maybe the APs are meshed into the bridge AP, or maybe into the main building APs directly? Nope, if I isolate the APs on their own VLANs, they lose their DHCP and connectivity on the wireless networks. 
 So what else could it be? Can Aerohive bridges somehow share a link that only Aerohive APs can pick up? Some sort of tunnel? Is there anything I can do to get the wired connections on the switch live?
 To be clear, everything works fine in the main building, e.g., wired and wireless client connect without issue, plenty of available DHCP addresses, no MAC filtering.
 Any help will be greatly appreciated. I don&#x27;t want to have to scrap the whole wing just to get a couple wired devices on the network.

                              <span>Greetings,
 Up until last week, I had two in-wall LG dual inverter AC units running side by side, doing a fine job of cooling my 10 x 10 x 8 server room. We&#x27;re in a heat wave right now with temperatures above 100 F and these coolers all of a sudden just stopped cooling. I have about ten 2U servers in there plus three 2U UPS units.
 I bought these coolers about 1.5 years ago and they ran through last year&#x27;s heatwave just fine, but now it seems like they just can&#x27;t get rid of the heat anymore, I&#x27;ve got some backups in there right now, but I&#x27;m hesitant to just buy more coolers without knowing what went wrong.
 Any expert opinions on this matter?

 So when does that phrase set off alarm bells?

                              <span>We are a hybrid environment. We have &quot;security defaults&quot; disabled because we need the ability to selectively disable MFA on a per user basis. You lose this ability when security defaults is turned on.
 In a best case scenario, I&#x27;d like to achieve the following. When we create a new user on-prem and after AAD connect runs and syncs the user up into O365 we want to make sure that MFA is enabled by default for that new user. I don&#x27;t want to have to wait up to 30 minutes after we have created the account for the sync to finish, then login to the O365 portal and then manually enable MFA for the new user. We want this to be automatic.
 How would I achieve this? We could set up a conditional access policy, but I don&#x27;t know exactly what to configure to make that a reality. The Microsoft support rep we spoke with says even if we did a conditional access policy, we would still have to manually enable MFA for the new user, which is what we&#x27;re trying to avoid.

                              <span>The trouble for JP Morgan can be traced to a project where the company aimed to delete from its systems any older communications and documents that were no longer required to be retained. According to the SEC’s summary, the project experienced “glitches,” with those documents identified for deletion failing to be deleted under the processes implemented by JPMorgan.

                              <span>I used to love IT, networking specifically. Now I&#x27;m basically an IT contractor. I used to love configuring network devices with the CLI, planning out networks, I eventually want to get into cybersecurity. I normally love problem solving and I used to be thrilled to learn about technologies. Now I just hate it. I hate working with 365, project planning/managing, doing file migrations, email, cutovers, working with software vendors, and working with our customers. I&#x27;m starting to resent my coworkers and company as whole. I&#x27;m not sure how to remedy the situation because this was my only career choice. This is my 3rd IT job and I don&#x27;t remember hating my old ones like this. The work was similar, albeit less moving parts. I&#x27;m not sure if IT is not the career for me, or if my current job is just killing the passion. I have my N+, A+, and I&#x27;m working toward Sec+. I am so disinteresed/frustrated with work I don&#x27;t have the motivation to read my CompTIA books anymore, but the thought of abandoning something I used to be so passionate about breaks my heart. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.
 EDIT: this got way more responses than i anticipated! i dont have time today to reapond to everyone, but i have lots to consider now. I feel a lot better about the situation after reading so many perspectives. thank you guys so much for the insightful advice.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve dealt with plenty of user termination tickets in my 21 year career, but today was for a fallen comrade. On a team of just a few dozen, I had to disable the account of a teammate after his unexpected passing over the weekend. Nothing quite prepares you for processing a sudden loss of a colleague you interact with daily and then having to also continue operating the business and deal with the logistics of the circumstances. To my fellow sysadmin, you will be deeply missed.
 EDIT: Greatly appreciate all the support and stories! I hope this has allowed some of you who&#x27;ve experienced the same thing to reflect on those who have passed like I have done today.

                              <span>I remember a good conversation some time ago about if an IT role reports to finance it is a big red flag. While currently job hunting i&#x27;m regularly encountering IT Manager and IT Director roles reporting to CFO. 
 Thoughts? Good, Bad, indifferent?

                              <span>Obviously everyone is cloud crazy, it&#x27;s become like a religion. However I&#x27;m hearing more and more stories of firms that have migrated to cloud and then hit a brick wall.
 Not only costs but things not working, latency issues etc 
 Do you guys have experiences of this
 Edit: cheers all for the replies. Much appreciated. Every one a good and interesting read.
 I&#x27;m now off to shout at MS support because my email is down 😂😭😭😭

                              <span>This is a sanity check before I start drafting my H1 performance reviews. I’m at a big healthcare company and the company as a whole has actually done pretty well and is expanding. 
 The problem is that all the major system improvements (can’t be too specific because I don’t want to identify myself) I wanted to do are nowhere near where they should be. 
 Looking back, my team has been just trying to keep our heads above water in terms of system uptime, tickets closed, and other unplanned work. 
 I need to come up with a presentation to our CTO and CEO outlining the progress so far this year and plans for the last half of 2023. 
 Any advice on how to position this and outlining how not to repeat from July on?

 Tragically, our PS script that we had been using previously that accomplished this broke with the Azure API updates. And if anyone is interested in taking a crack at identifying/fixing the broken script, I can send it to you to take a look at. But I&#x27;ve been beating my head against a wall trying to fix the syntax all last week but just keep getting more errors.
 Regardless, we are happy to start fresh with a modern audit AD + Azure AD user audit script that any of you are currently using if you&#x27;re willing to share it.

                              <span>If you allow it, self-service recovery could be abused by rogue employees to bypass USB write restrictions and DLP restrictions to exfiltrate data. They can remove the drive, mount it to another PC and use the recovery key to unlock it so they can copy any data they want to their own device prior to leaving the company.
 If you don’t allow it, an attacker could social engineer the help desk to provide them with the recovery key to a stolen laptop over the phone or email. This bypasses any user MFA process that could have been applied if they always referred the users to use self-service recovery.
 What’s the better option?

                              <span>Having a weird problem that I can&#x27;t figure out. We did an in place upgrade on a 2016 server to 2022. Since that every once in a while the server will freeze up for 20 seconds, you can click on the windows on the taskbar but you can&#x27;t do anything with the windows. Looking into the event log I cannot find anything useful. I was on the server after hours without anyone else logged into it and the event log showed nothing at the time it happened. All I have been able to find online was the firewall rule fix and the microsoft ink fix. Neither one worked, and after those two things the entire server lost the ability to print, gives an error saying &quot;cannot create print job&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried SFC, DISM, check disk. If anyone has any other ideas I am all ears.

 Have any of you gone down the route of just using a single remote access software and how did that work out? Our management is &quot;debating&quot; removal of TeamViewer. Is there a product that could replace it for a significantly better cost but similar in terms of ease of use?

                              <span>Yeah, this development is not something to be messed around with. Yet, this is Google&#x27;s retort:
  
I think this is the time to tell you that I already reported this to Google, and they say this is not a security vulnerability (probably because this secret browser is not very popular), and that the parental control bypass is the “Intended Behavior”
  
We know that not only that browser extensions can be malicious, but so can Google&#x27;s own shortsightedness.

                              <span>Is there a way to take cloud accounts that were created solely in the cloud, and get them syncing with a User in a dc?
 Wed like to connect AzureAD where Bob Smith (BSmith) already has an account in cloud, with BSmith locally on the DC so that they can use the single account/password.
 I was hoping there was a solution that didn&#x27;t involve manually editing attributes...and didn&#x27;t involve new local profiles.

                              <span>Hey there!
 I work in the cybersecurity sphere and, recently, I prepared reviews on the most needed cybersecurity tools and software for my business clients.
 A month ago, I added a comparison table of the best business password managers. There’re prices, feature lists, scores, explanations, and some other details on each manager.
 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yE9Va9s8FmFltAyAGxpNlK7hTrUFMDkAwIgsPSfeLNg/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing 
 You can find there 1Password, NordPass, LastPass, Keeper, DashLane, BitWarden, and a bunch of other solutions.
 ​
 A quick overview of the research I made:
  
Only around 50% of all password managers went through any external cybersecurity audits.
 All password managers have a high-level encryption algorithm, but I, personally, think that the best is XChaCha20.…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys,
 i have to create a guideline for my company regarding erasing disks from all data before they go back into storage or before they go to another user.
 For this i bought a version of &quot;parted magic&quot; because i had good experiences with it in the past.
 Now for my question: What exactly is the difference between Secure Erase and Sanitize?
 I thought, that secure erase only deletes the mapping table or did so in the past. But according to the tooltip in &quot;parted magic&quot; Secure Erase ALSO overwrites everything with 0 or resets the NAND to 0 via a volt spike.
 So why is sanitize better than secure erase if in the end you still have only zeros everywhere.
 I read that sanitize also has stuff like crpyto scramble. But does that really matter if the data was overwritten anyway?
 Thank you for your help!
 Greetings from Germany :)

 Just me or anyone else experiencing the same phenomenon?

 I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let&#x27;s say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.
 Customer wise, for simplicity we&#x27;ll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.
 I&#x27;m building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I&#x27;ve tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I&#x27;m having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).
 I tried to borrow the principles from [this article] but it wouldn&#x27;t work for me. 
 Is what I&#x27;m trying to do possible?

                              <span>Hello,
 we have some virtual Windows servers (mainly 2012 R2) with MBR partitions used to store files, the problem is the 2tb limit that we need to remove.
 What&#x27;s the best strategy to migrate to GPT minimizing the downtime ?

                              <span>Hi,
 I got a weird issue that has been going on couple of months now and I decided to get to the bottom of it once an for all.
 We all use lenovo laptops which are connected to a docking station, and the DS is connected to two monitors.
 In our Group Policy Settings we have our default power plan which manages couple of settings, one of which is Display-&gt;Turn off display after: on battery 15min, plugged in 15min.
 When this is active, my and every other monitor in the company goes off/ to sleep mode after 30 seconds, but only on LOCK SCREEN! No matter how many minutes i select in GPO and apply it I always see the same result. If the Windows are not locked then it works like expected.
 Only if I set the display to never turn off (so 0 in GPO) and never on energy settings in Windows does the monitor stay awake - but this is not something that we want. After you are not around for 15-20 minutes there is no reason to keep the monitors turned on.
 Hybrid sleep is off. The monitor settings have been checked multiple times, there is no any power saving mode active. The same thing happens if the laptop is on its own, the display will turn off in a matter of seconds. I did not check the bios settings, but this should not cause the problem?
 ​
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hi,
 question for my fellow gerrit hosting admins. We&#x27;ve recently migrated to a Google Workspace and started using their &quot;secure ldap&quot; as the LDAP provider.
 Because of slow and long responses we&#x27;ve started caching some of the data such as 
 [cache &quot;accounts&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 [cache &quot;ldap_groups&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 [cache &quot;ldap_groups_byinclude&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 [cache &quot;ldap_usernames&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 But according to our employees, listing/suggest reviewers is still very slow, I&#x27;ve searched through documentation and forums, but I couldn&#x27;t find what data could I cash to speed it up. 
 Also, another question, any others tips for using gerrit and a cloud ldap provider (besides don&#x27;t do it, because that was my response as well)

 Current setup:
 All singins are transferred to a log analytics workspace. There I&#x27;ve set up an alert with the following query: 
 SigninLogs | where Status.errorCode !&#x3D; 0 // Filter all successful logins | extend City&#x3D;LocationDetails.city, State&#x3D;LocationDetails.state, Country&#x3D;LocationDetails.countryOrRegion, Error_Code&#x3D;Status.errorCode, Failure_Reason&#x3D;Status.failureReason | project TimeGenerated, UserDisplayName, AppDisplayName, IPAddress, City, State, Country, AuthenticationRequirement, Failure_Reason, ConditionalAccessStatus, ConditionalAccessPolicies, Error_Code 
 On success (currently 10 lines in 3 hours) it sends an email. But this is triggering a lot of false positives. Looking for help slimming this down to more useful results...

 I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution about this that I could deploy through GPO but the only thing I could find was people being pissed, but no clear GPO setting to turn off that shit.
 Anyone got a tip for me ? 
 Also, F*** Microsoft for this. It&#x27;s always unwarranted changes like that that make my job more difficult.

 We have a client and the users do not have administration rights, they have an app installed that needs an update almost everyday.
 I wonder if they are able to without administration rights.
 Any tips if not?

The application can work with SQL Server or MySQL, It will run one database per each user and the goal is to minimize the impact of a potential penetration, and our team is discussing two scenarios, 1) One SQL Server with hardening techniques applied 2) run each database on a dockerized instance of MySQL, we know that this last option also requires hardening at docker layer. Any opinion will be useful.

 I&#x27;m in the process of deploying WDAC in a customer environment. One of the things I&#x27;ve started to notice is how long the WDAC Wizard takes to both merge and update XML policies, the larger they get (20 minutes to 45 minutes). Does anyone know if it&#x27;s possible to speed this process up or is this simply as long as it takes? The base XML file for this policy is ~18 MB.
 Thanks so much in advance.

                              <span>Hello.
 Only starting with networks, so apologies if this is a stupid question.
 I have been put in (de facto) charge of a smallish AV network and I&#x27;m learning as I go along. We have four Netgear switches addressed 172.16.0.250-253 on a 255.255.0.0 subnet. All four keep sending out an ARP request to discover who 172.16.0.255 is every second. This address is unallocated. Why do they do this and is it suboptimal?
 Almost everything (~150 devices) is on static IP address, but I believe that the devices are inconsistent in their subnet configuration; that is to say some have been configured 255.255.255.0 and some have been configured 255.255.0.0. Is this the cause for the ARP?
 Thanks for any assistance!

                              <span>Small enterprise organization is getting 500/500 from ISP, but the only devices getting this speed are the on-site servers. All other devices are usually getting 150-200 download speeds and 300-400 upload speeds. Even when I bypass the firewall and connect directly to the ISP&#x27;s Adva FSP 150, none of the devices I&#x27;m trying (mix of Dell Latitudes and Lenovo Thinkpads) are getting the correct speed.
 ISP verified duplex speed was set to 1000Mbps Auto (Fortinet firewall was set manually to 1000Full and auto-negotiate, no change). There don&#x27;t seem to be any packets being dropped. I&#x27;ve tried setting the DNS manually (the server itself, google, cloudfare) on the end devices to see if that changes anything, but no change there. Bandwidth usage is normal. Tried troubleshooting during active hours and also after hours, no change in speed. Tried adjusting TCP Window Scaling Settings on end-devices, updating drivers, verifying cables were un-damaged CAT5e or CAT6 cables, trying different network profile settings on end-devices, manually setting IP information, checked for malware...
 Can anyone offer me any advice or tips as to what I should be looking for here? I&#x27;ve been searching for answers online for a couple of weeks and nothing that has come up is helping.

 I run a small home automation/control business and i need to provide better documentation to onsite engineers.
 Im trying to find some software that will allow me to assign hardware to rooms/areas and assign IP ranges, then export a CSV or document of some type.
 It would be great to be able to provide engineers with this that they could then populate with MAC and Serial numbers for example.
 Is there any software that would help with this?

 I&#x27;m trying to setup a LACP/LAGG connection.
 I have a few questions and was hoping folks around here might have some clue:
  
Do individual interfaces on a LAG have different IP addresses?
 If I had to setup a mac-binding - if the interfaces show up as a single ip, what mac address will it have?
 If the interfaces have separate IPs, does that mean eventually the TCP/IP ports are also effectively doubled?
  
I have so much confusion here, hoping someone would clear it for me 😅

 I have been bashing my head against a wall over an issue and I&#x27;m hoping that posting about it could hopefully lead to someone who has had a similar issue point me in the right direction.
 Some background:
 Until very recently we were using Comcast Business VoiceEdge as my VoIP provider. Initially this was chosen because it came with it&#x27;s own internet connection, and at the time we were pretty bandwidth starved.
 Fast forward five years later, and we are no longer bandwidth starved, and I decided to get rid of Comcast (finally!) and switch to Vonage as our VoIP provider as it ended up being cheaper and came with a LOT more features and didn&#x27;t have a backend interface that feels like it was written by students in a 5th grade intro to website design class.

                              <span>Versa headend hosted in aws and trying to deploy branch using cms. (Tried bare metal as well and same result)
 When deployed, from the director, branch is reachable via public IPs and vice versa. Also confirmed the ports are open to get them on board.
 When deployed, IPsec connects and disconnects multiple time and eventually it disconnects and shows ptvi down, not sure what is the issue here.
 Does branch needs to reach any of OOB IPs of headend? (Mgmt, controller, analytic) 
 I see the branch is registered on the Director. It seems like it&#x27;s not establishing ipsec tunnel.

I see cool projects like SONiC, FRR, Quagga, Cumulus Linux, OpenvSwitch etc. Learning is not the problem but I ask myself where will I apply these? I have applied all my networking in an enterprise setup where open networking is non existant. 
 Anyone with similar interests, how is your journey towards learning and applying this.

From a few google searches I found that it stands for AutoStore Status Monitoring Protocol. I am new to networking and am not sure what exactly this service does, and I can’t find any information on google other than the port that it typically runs on. Anyone able to provide some info on this? Thanks

                              <span>Lately I’ve been looking to see if there are any native options there that support cloud file share as well as a similar fashion of ACLs and locking down folder permissions likely your typical NTFS shares. 
 Our environment has a presence of AADDS (Azure AD domain services), however, this isn’t on-prem and it’s soely used for virtual machines, only. 
 Our machines are AAD Cloud joined, and our user identities are also cloud sourced. From looking, the only native option for file share in Azure is Azure Files, and it doesn’t support NTFS permissions, plus only works with storage account keys. You can only truly use Kerberos and ACL permissions if your identities are hybrid, (the devices can still be AAD joined in this case) 
 Given the fact that, if we were to have our identities hybrid, we’d be able to receive Kerberos tickets on an AAD joined machine, in result this opens a few doors for us, without even having the need to hybrid join machines. 
 The other option would be to dump 10+ TB into sharepoint, however, to me, that makes absolutely no sense as Sharepoint Online is not meant to replace a file system. 
 Thoughts? Would it better a better option to ditch the managed domain in AADDS and move to ADDS? Users would be hybrid, devices would still be cloud joined. So it wouldn’t necessarily be completely moving to “on-prem”, plus if we already have and utilize Azure AD domain services, I don’t really see a point in it, being that Azure AD domain services is extremely limited and probably better for a mom &amp; pop shop type of environment.

 Do ya&#x27;ll folks use git for your orchestration files. I usually have a separate S3 bucket to back up and track my yaml files for docker compose and expansible playbooks. We are moving to adopt k8s in the near future. We are using terraform as well and was thinking about just throwing this over to our git. The problem is that a lot of our products are micro services and we are already filling up our git with a lot of repos. Are any of ya&#x27;ll just using git or are you segmenting your infra code from your app code?

                              <span>We have recently noticed an unusual issue impacting several clients where Google Chrome is seemingly hanging on SSL handshake when connecting to new websites.
 The issue appears to cause the SSL to hang when the website is loading, usually taking 10-20 seconds before the &quot;Initial Connection&quot; completes. Once the website loads the issue goes away until you start a new browser session.

 Troubleshooting
 First, we suspected a server-side issue, but this occurs on MANY different unrelated websites, in-fact nearly any website has the same issue if it is using HTTPS.
 Secondly, we have tested using different Internet connections, ISPs, mobile hotspot, DNS servers and Proxy servers, all which did not resolve the issue, this leans me to believe this is purely a device-level issue.
 We have tested different browsers, Edge (Chromium) and Firefox do NOT experience this issue, only Google Chrome. Furthermore, we have not had any reports from MacOS users yet, only windows users. All windows machines running the latest OS updates.
 Updating to the latest version of chrome does not resolve the issue. Older versions, beta, etc also experience the issue.
 My suspicion is that there is an issue relating to both windows/chrome interacting together that is causing the SSL/Initial Connection to hang for a long period of time when loading pages. But I cannot isolate any particular cause.
 Im at a loss for where to look next at this point, the issue seems to be disconnected from any specific client, software, policy, etc. 
 Would like to hear if any other Techs out there have seen anything like this? Let me know if you have any tips for what we can try next....

                              <span>Recently, me and a few friends discussed how we all work in ”IT” and to our friends and family we probably all do the same stuff as each other. Despite sharing similar job titles, it became evident that our daily work experiences were incredibly diverse, highlighting the vast range of responsibilities each of us held. 
 So there for I&#x27;m genuinely curious to hear about the workdays of you guys/gals/pals and how they differ. It would be cool to hear what your job title is, what kind of company you work for, size of the company, and most importantly please share how a typical day in the life looks for you?
 I fully acknowledge that this topic has likely been covered before, but I&#x27;ve always enjoyed reading such posts, so here we are! 
 Hope u have a great day!

                              <span>I need to convert some physical Windows Servers to Virtual Machines. I&#x27;m presently using VMware vCenter Converter to do this. However, I am running into some potential issues.
 There are two physical DC&#x27;s. The primary appears to be a core. The secondary is standard. I can convert the second, but the primary fails.
 The DC that I have successfully converted, has a storage space of 400+ GB. Not all of it is used, but all of it appears in the conversion. Is there any way to cut this down and only use what is necessary? I don&#x27;t have a ton of spare space presently.
 Edit: I&#x27;ve responded to a few of you, but it&#x27;s clear that I just need to rebuild into a new VM. 
 I just need to review the process first. Will hopefully get this done this week.
 Thank you all for the help. If you have additional advice regarding the process to do this...let me know. 
 I have several spare 2019 licenses. 2022 licenses would need to be acquired (extremely slow process). I don&#x27;t want to remain on 2012.

 Part of the system involves an in-house application responsible for orchestration of the whole mess. From GUI&#x27;s, shared memory, data acquisition and distribution across hardware IO and several networks, starting and stopping .exe&#x27;s etc etc. you get the idea. 
 As you might imagine, there&#x27;s a good deal of co-ordination necessary to ensure each compute node has the right config.
 Today, the team has the application architecture so that each relevant node connects to multiple SMB shares on PC login. And pretty much everything runs directly from the network shares (yay) including writ…</span>

 Sometimes there is a problem and they open up a ticket on their end, and add a bunch of people on my team to the ticket.
 I&#x27;d really prefer they opened a ticket with us, but I then had to stop and think about how that would work. I suppose they could email our ticketing email address and open one that way.
 Curious how others handle this.
 They do not have access to any of our systems nor accounts in our domain and they never will.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got a small team that hasn&#x27;t had much turnover for a while, but we&#x27;ve had a few replacements recently, and have expanded a bit, so we are trying to formalize a few of the processes we were &quot;just doing&quot; in the past to make sure that they dont get missed.
 Im curious how other teams of a similar size (~6) manage re-occurring tasks / obligations eg
  
Tickets - Daily
 Monitoring checks - Daily
 Vulnerability Checks - Weekly
 ​
  
At $OLDWORK$ i wrote a checklist system that would populate each day with new tasks / or on a schedule. I could rebuild it here, but im sure there is either an O/S equivalent, or a better way of doing things
 Ideally I&#x27;d like something that could send reminders if tasks havnt been completed. Bonus points for supporting multiple task schedules / across multiple teams.
 We do have access to existing tools like ServiceNow, Confluence/Jira etc, O365 etc.

                              <span>Hi,
 I work at a primarily Windows focused company and 90% of our servers are Windows Servers and we utilize all the usual Windows Server roles. Nothing special there.
 We do have a few Linux servers running as well, since we have some solutions that either require Linux or just &quot;belongs&quot; on Linux. Right now we just have non-managed admin accounts for each admin on these servers, but that really doesn&#x27;t comply with best practices and our own policies. It&#x27;s mostly Ubuntu Server 20.04 and 22.04, so is there an easy way to either join them to Active Directory for managing these admin accounts, or create an alternative user directory just for these servers? I guess that Active Directory would be the best solution.
 We don&#x27;t need much in term of functionality, &quot;just&quot; a simple but stable way to manage admin accounts. What are our options?

 Can the SUP roles still exist on both site server and passive server, but only the DB offloaded?

 Would it make sense to merge the other MS365 tenant into ours or leave it separate in case he ever sells it off in the future?
 I know IT management would be a lot easier bringing in their AD environment, syncing with one MS365 tenant, etc.. We could just create aliases for email and so forth.
 I&#x27;m just not sure how painful it would be to separate the companies in the future since we&#x27;d have to work with whoever they bring in as the IT folks and if they are going to be easy to work with or not.

                              <span>How many VLAN do you have in your business network? And for what do you use them? 
 For some companies i have 10 VLANs, and still could need more. But I am wondering what is &quot;normal&quot; to have.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We’ve recently found out that our ldap and m365 accounts aren’t alligned when it comes to password expiry. Writeback is turned on, users can reset their pw on 365 and will sync with ldap and vice versa if we reset it in AD.
 Issue is, if the expiry policy for ldap kicks in (90 days) and M365 keeps going. I found an article about EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers is disabled by default.
 Before sending in a change request, if I enable this setting on, will this just replicate our ldap pw expiry policy?
 We’re a K-12 and student passwords aren’t set to expire while staff are set to 90 days.
 Has anyone turned on this feature and can share their experience? Will greatly appreciate.
 Thanks

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been a sysadmin for about 10 years with my company, slowly pushing them away from vendors and towards all internally managed systems.
 I learned what I needed to on the networking side of things, but never went too deep, until now.
 Our current Cisco core/users stacks went EOL last year, so I took on the project of upgrading them all to Meraki. I planned everything out and we had the cutover yesterday. We had a few little easily solvable issues, but only one persistent one that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out.
 We have two mitel5000 phone systems. The original configuration had both uplinks to those system set as access, so I just mirrored that on the Meraki. both phone systems have two IP addresses and on both phone systems only one of the two is showing online. In the office, its sporadic, but some phones are online and some are stuck on contacting server.
 We just use VLAN1 for voip, and the VLAN DHCP Relays are working fine with everything else. I can ping both phone system gateways from the 192.168.1.1 subnet on the meraki, but every other subnet fails.
 Networking is far from my forte, so this may well be something stupid easy, but it&#x27;s got me stumped so any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 Just wanted to check in for a brief update after my last big post.
 First and foremost, thankyou. 
 I had a large number of helpful responses in the last post, as well as some people reaching out to me via direct messages, offering anything from advice to work opportunities. 
 Apologies to those who DM&#x27;ed me since I never responded - I wanted to more sort my head out before responding to them, but appreciated the thought regardless.
 ​
 I ended up talking to the boss about my workload, where things are at, where I&#x27;m going, pay, stuff like that.
 Unfortunately, the discussion didn&#x27;t really go anywhere - he has no input on pay, and he pushed the management of my workload to me. Told me to start saying no to things and manage things better and a few other fairly unhelpful ideas.

 ​
 i am in charge of a hotel, which is going to open soon. 4 Servers, 25 PCs, as of know. Since its a family business, im the &quot;only&quot; sysadmin and in charge of the full 4 floors, and the nearby restaurant when its finished.
 ​
 I&#x27;ll keep it short: Would you deploy Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise right now? I tend to 10, but looking at 2025, i think 11 would be better.
 ​
 Please help me out, what do you think? :D

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for ways to secure our backups even more and thought about the idea of controlling access to our NAS, that contains the Veeam Copy backups. I thought it would be nice to have a powerswitch that can be controlled by Veeam, by using a pre/ post backup script. When the backup copy starts, the controlled powerswitch turns on a simple (unmanaged) networkswitch that connects the NAS to the backup VLAN. When the copyjob is done, the network switch is turned off again. Do you guys know of network connected powerswitches that can be controlled by a script, or command?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 We have some strange behavior from google DNS when I interogate .net domains.
 dig .net @8.8.8.8 - no response
 but 
 dig +trace .net @8.8.8.8 - I get full respose
 Also I get error when I use https://dns.google/
 { &quot;Status&quot;: 2 /* SERVFAIL /, &quot;TC&quot;: false, &quot;RD&quot;: true, &quot;RA&quot;: true, &quot;AD&quot;: false, &quot;CD&quot;: false, &quot;Question&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;avimag.net.&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: 1 / A */ } ] }
 I only on my side?
 Thanks

 They asked me to reboot the server and the check if other applications are working fine. But at the moment the server shows : Working on updates 100% complete don&#x27;t turn off the computer
 Do I wait? Or could anyone give me insights?

 Suppose you have vlan 10 and with that an SVI of 192.168.10.1/24 that lives on Switch A. 
 If you had a trunk between switch A and switch B, there&#x27;s NO reason to have an SVI also on vlan 10 on switch B, right?

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m in the middle of a ASA to Palo Alto migration and have come to stage of now testing the rules i&#x27;ve done. I&#x27;m using a combo of the &quot;URL Category&quot; and security profiles to test acces to URLs and websites.
 I&#x27;m a bit stuck in terms of how to go about this in the best way, what is the most realistic and scalable way of doing it.
 I have a &quot;catch-all block-all-url security profile&quot; at the bottom that blocks everything that isn&#x27;t matched and i have made custom URL category lists for different websites that servers will need access to. I&#x27;m in the mindset that i won&#x27;t need to know EVERY background URL on a website, since servers won&#x27;t actaully be accessing the webpages, more than likely pull things down from the sites or making API calls etc..
 However, for the odd one or two that do need …</span>

                              <span>I work in install and repair and I occasionally do bigger residential houses with multiple lines. I normally will go around with all my tools and terminate all the lines at once. Once that is done I will use my tone box and one by one find out which lines are which at the modem. Terminate and label them. Then I do a lap with my laptop to test all the wire runs and patch cords. Is there a tool like my tone box/wand that can tone multiple lines? It would also be nice if that tool could also pair test too.

                              <span>I have a router (MX80 18.2R3-S1.7) with VPLS. Two local interfaces are connected to this VPLS (xe-0/0/3.600, ge-1/1/8.600). Two switches are connected to these interfaces (with identical uplink configurations). The problem is that I see different MAC addresses on the two different interfaces (most of them match, but there are also unique ones). Why could this be happening? In the &quot;show vpls mac-table&quot; output, I can see all MAC addresses, but the individual MAC addresses are missing on the switches connected

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say i have 2 router edges (Router A and Router B) that&#x27;s connected through BGP peering to different internet exchanges. Router A is connected to IX1 and Router B is connected to IX2. For some reason, i want to use GRE Tunnel on Router A to an upstream that&#x27;s only available on IX2. Do i only need to connect Router A and Router B, like with VLAN, and that&#x27;s it?
 NB: I&#x27;m a new NOC hire in a small datacenter and i&#x27;m trying to get to know things, so bear with me if i ask dumb questions lol.

                              <span>If you had a basic Layer 2 leading up to an Aggregate Switch that would then pass the traffic to a FW. Should you set up the Aggregate SW to be Layer 2 or 3? DHCP and services would be running on FW as well. I can see benefits for both but was curious what others opinions were.

 What I am trying to understand is:
  
Client initiates a SSH connection but does the client use server&#x27;s credentials to login?
 If so, is the server&#x27;s credential supposed to be hardcoded on the client and where so? some config XML file?

                              <span>Hi, I work for an ISP and I&#x27;m facing an issue which could be easily solved by implementing bgp between my customer cpe and my bras. 
 To give HA to my customers tho, I&#x27;m using an anycast ip address to terminate customers pppoe, with cisco load balancing method and without bgp peering all is working fairly good (aside from this crappy issue I&#x27;m facing, which is a particular specific scenario, and won&#x27;t bother you with details, those doesn&#x27;t matter for the sake of this thread)
 I&#x27;d like to give via radius some attributes to my bras so it establish a dynamic bgp peering with cpe, do any of you have ever used something like this? What I&#x27;m scared of is which ip address to use on bras side to establish the bgp peering
 Thanks in advance and have a nice weekend!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I need to connect to a 10Gb Arista switch. I&#x27;m going to buy a NIC and I need a low latency NIC. I&#x27;ll buy the card from Supermicro AOC-A25G-m2SM . I couldn&#x27;t find any information regarding that NIC can work with SFP+ or not.
 I saw that generally SFP28 NIC can be used with SFP+ but I want to make sure about that before ordering the NIC.
 Can I use Mellanox ConnectX-6 Lx with SFP+?
 Thanks in advance.

 Is only having a L3 switch simplify the deployment complexity? Or having a firewall in front of all equipment more secure/safe?

 Just looking for some video resources on Windows Sysinternals Tools! Specifically providing a summary on all the tools available within the suite, along with a tutorial on how to use them in Production. I’m mainly looking to use this suite to aid me in conducting Malware Analysis.
 Anything you can share would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have been following discussions on whether organizations should use cloud storage/compute or run their services locally. There seems to NOT be a clear winner between these two solutions, in terms of costs, reliability, uptime, security, management, scalability, capex vs opex, time savings, use cases etc.
 What’s your take on this? Are there specific business use cases that CANNOT be moved to cloud compute?

                              <span>Hi Guys! I&#x27;m doing a research for my new venture and we&#x27;re still deciding on whether to get a cloud provider. AWS seems pretty solid so far but I still see many orgs having their own infrastructure. curious to know the opinions on this. why would you stay on-premises? or prefer any other provider?

                              <span>I keep hearing horror stories about job reqs receiving 1000&#x27;s of applicants with advanced degrees for entry level jobs. It seems to me most of these are &quot;I finished my 6 week boot camp now I want a six-figure 100% remote job&quot;. 
 What it is like for someone who say has 20+ years of experience, is local and not looking for 100% remote, has a BSCS, grinds LeetCode Medium/Hards daily, and has been continuously employed with the same company for more than 5 years?

Customers are mostly system administrators, CISOs, etc. How can I sell cybersecurity products if I hardly understand how everything is connected and how everything works? 
 Are there any courses, books, trainings, further education that you can recommend to me? 
 For your information: I am new in IT. 
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>When I left my previous job they were sad. The manager said &quot;Hey the door is always open.&quot; But I figure that is just something they say to be nice.
 This was only two months ago. In two months at this new place I&#x27;ve gotten paid much better but I&#x27;m just like... drowning in old technology. The company is literally 15 years behind in tech and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll go anywhere. I&#x27;m way more stressed. Management brings up my &quot;Time tracker&quot; at least 3 times a week (I&#x27;m salary). Not to mention the people are much less fun.
 I saw my old company posted a job similar to what I was doing... How pathetic would it be for me to reach out to my old manager and ask about it? Feels like crawling back after failing. I feel like I&#x27;m job hopping almost now.

                              <span>Like many people currently, I just moved a handful of domains away from Google Domains. As expected, all domain transfers added one year to the expiration, except one.
 This one domain was &quot;auto renewed&quot; at Google domains just over a week before being transferred. The transfer did not add a year to the expiration. I asked the new registrar what happened and they said the domain was in the auto-renewal grace period, which occurs after a domain has expired. I thought there&#x27;s no way, Google auto renewed the domain, how could it have expired?
 So I started looking at my Google domain transactions. If the transaction dates are anything to go by, the domain was originally purchased at X time. The &quot;auto renew&quot; transaction happened one year later on the same date, but at X + just under two hours. So it appears Google domains let this domain expire for almost two hours before the &quot;auto renew&quot; took place. This put the domain into the grace period which means when I transferred it, no additional year was added.
 Again, this is what appears to have happened. Going off of transaction times and the fact that the transfer didn&#x27;t add a year to the expiration. Google domains says the auto renew feature is supposed to renew a domain within a month before expiration. It seems like they didn&#x27;t and cost me a year&#x27;s worth of registration. Not a lot of money, but what bothers me more is thinking my domain may not have been working, which I use mainly for email, for almost two hours before the auto renew happened. And I probably wouldn&#x27;t have noticed if I didn&#x27;t transfer it.
 If anyone from Google domains is here, you owe me $12.

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 I have a client with a very strange issue with a local HP Laserjet Pro M404n printer. The prints do not come out even though the printer is redirected from the local PC to the AVD session. 
 However, if I were to redirect the printer back to the local desktop, the prints come through just fine. 
 Notes: 1. Both the local desktop and AVD recognize the printer. 2. The printer is plugged in through USB-A, so no wireless or networking is configured. 3. I checked the RDP settings in the host pool and printer redirection is enabled. 4. Tried doing a restart of the AVD and reinstalling the AVD client. 5. There&#x27;s no error messages that appear on the AVD 6. Printer can print just fine on the local desktop with no issues and HP Smart is installed 7. Tried installing the HP Print drivers in the AVD but it says the OS isn&#x27;t compatible even though it&#x27;s Windows 10 64 bit but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s shared computer license.
 What else can I try or look for?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen throughout this sub many people reference Defender for Endpoint, and as someone who is currently using Sophos, our subscription is up in November and I want to evaluate DFE MDE.
 I have a dev tenant already set up, I imaged a spare laptop and joined it to my Azure AD and enrolled it in Intune. 
 I started a trial for DFE MDE and I tried setting up a configuration profile via Intune to enroll my client in DFE MDE. The configuration profile marks as successful, but in the security admin center under device inventory I don&#x27;t currently see any devices listed in there. I have created some AV policies but AFAIK they are not working (for example I tried to disable the user from being able to open defender settings, and currently I can still override my AV settings just by going through the Windows Defender security settings).
 I downloaded and ran some well known malware (mimikatz) and was able to launch and run commands in mimikatz. About 5 mins of the computer sitting idle, I heard a few notifications come in saying &quot;Enterprise unwanted application found&quot; and indicates it deleted the threats. 
 I&#x27;m fairly confused, clearly that doesn&#x27;t seem right. I re-enrolled the device a second time using the local script .cmd approach however I still don&#x27;t see any devices listed in the M365 Defender/security admin portal. There is no indicator on the client that DFE MDE has been installed (does it need to be &quot;installed&quot; per se or just enrolled?)
 Obviously being able to launch and run commands in mimikatz was only possible because I disabled the real time protection and clicked past many warnings, but still something doesn&#x27;t seem right there. Is DFE MDE just a centralized location for admins to manipulate built in Windows Defender settings? I&#x27;m a little confused currently.
 Sorry if these are stupid questions.

                              <span>I wanted to see if anyone had any experience tracking assets in a large building with RFID. I have a little experience with active RFID but the ones I used were rather large. 
 Does anyone have any thoughts on a small RFID tag that could be placed on computers or thin clients. 
 Are there any USB powered active RFID tags out there?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been looking at site24x7 as a possible contender for a network and infrastructure monitoring solution for our organization. I did a demo with their engineer and the product looks pretty good. Pricing isn&#x27;t terrible but the one big issue I have is the snmp polling interval.
 All of their product information talks about 1 minute polling, but apparently their on premise poller for snmp monitoring only does 5 minute polling? They keep side stepping the issue saying they still do up/down monitoring every minute, but statistics like in/out bandwidth is only collected once every 5 minutes.
 Is this correct? If so, for anyone else that uses site24x7 and has their on premise poller, have you had issues with the granularity only being 5 minutes?

                              <span>Some Background, I do some volunteer work for a church I used to go to and they have an old bare metal Windows 2016 server running AD, Quickbooks, and a file share. I&#x27;ve been trying to think through options for when this thing either dies or goes EOL and I remembered clients at my previous MSP job running AAD with no on-prem DC and was wondering what drawbacks exist for this configuration? Some notes:
 -The church has E3 365 licenses already.
 -The only apps they use are the Quickbooks installed on the server and 365 apps locally.
 -Ideally they would get an MSP to help them but the church has very little money.
 I want to make the environment as maintenance free as possible, as going onsite is a full day trip. Any suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated!
 EDIT: Thanks for all the reply’s and advice. At the end of the day there’s only about 5 users and only 2 of them are full time so any solution will likely work well enough. Setting up AD was probably overkill but it was setup years ago and I don’t want to reinvent the entire network if I don’t have to. My biggest goal is just to get them following as many best practices as they can.

                              <span>This company i started working like 15 days ago have a cobol software for all their operations with windows xp, with win server 03 and we are starting to migrate to windows 11 and win server 22, the monday and i try to recover the &quot;deleted&quot; files except for two missing ones in recuva shows that the 2 missing files are not to be found on disk and they were moved managed to restore all but those files was i sabotaged ? the previous it guy the tuesday shows to save the day but i cant recover those files. and he never make a backup of the files but i taking all the blame in this situation what i should do? keep going with the migration or just step aside.
 the files that were deleted holds inventory information and the vat book. that is recoverable but would take like one month to recover. Edit 1: the cobol software isnt running on a mainframe its just an emulator on windows xp 7 and some windows 10 it was develop circa 2001. The previous IT guy did some backups and are dated from 2022. Yes is two &quot;servers&quot; one for each company in the same building for the same owners the server room has a network rack no ac no ups. They have in a server the running the same software for two divisions of the company and one more for avoiding vat this is one of the biggest hardware store and construccion in the state. Yes is a shame that such a big company doing shady stuff but third world country an hpe dl380 gen10+ cost for us 8000 usd
 Also english is not my mother languaje but i do me best to write as clear as i can
 Edit 2: we have serious suspects that the previous IT in revenge delete all the database because they didnt renew his contract and we re the new ones

I am tasked to look for an alternative solution for Endpoint Central. I have experienced with SCCM of Microsoft but my boss want me to have a matrix comparison of Microsoft, IBM and VMWare.
 Do IBM and VMWare has this kind of Endpoint Managrment tool as well? just hoping maybe some sysadmin are using this kind of tools from IBM and VMWare as im not sure if they have.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am trying to understand what would put my company and me at risk, and what I can and cannot do. I probably cannot just ask them, as the company is old-school and they&#x27;d prefer me just sitting idlely for an hour even though I have nothing to do.
 Our setup is as follows, Azure Active Directory, every machine is a Windows, all connected on the same internal network that you have to 2FA into your machine. All of the network is monitored and goes through a proxy. We also have laptop window machines that work on the same active directory account and if you want to access your work station inside the office from home, you have to use their VPN and then Remote Desktop into it. This all works great, and while I am not a Windows user myself, I am really pleased as to how nice the experience is, considering the heavy emphasis on safety.
 Now to my question, to what extent can my employer track me? My main questions are about the laptop, when it&#x27;s not connected to their network/ VPN, is there anything inside the laptop/ windows that is tracking what I am doing? Do I have to cover my camera? I am mostly asking because after finishing my work for the day and I am at the office, I usually have an hour or so to kill before I can go home, and I would like to Remote Desktop/ SSH into my home machine and continue working on my own stuff, but I am not sure if these can be tracked and if I would alert someone like I am doing something shady. 
 Basically I would like to access my own machine from the work laptop without causing problems for anyone.

                              <span>I am racking my brain around this assistive licensing model and it’s making my costs go up. If I had known I would need to pay extra for more cores I would have gone with a lower core count CPU. I have a 2.8 Ghz Xeon Platinum 8362 with 32 cores. I Initially wanted a Server Standard 2022 License but I am researching that I would need to get more licensing for cores? How does this work. I have used the various core calculators but my pricing is running to 10K for just the Standard edition. What is going on here

                              <span>Dear all, I am looking for a kiosk app that allows me to limit my Samsung S8 to specific apps / sites and restrict what a user can do with it. I have searched several MDM solutions and while having great functionality (perhaps more than needed) and all of them that I have found forces me to buy a minimum of 10/25 licenses. I only need one. Does any one know of a solution, either in 3rd party apps, or native android or Samsung? Up to 30$/year would be reasonable.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m starting my own business but honestly I don&#x27;t know if it will work at all and if my product will sell well. That&#x27;s why my resources are limited.
 I wanted to buy Intel nuc 13 pro with i7-1360P processor + 64GB ram. When I compare the specs, this computer has really great specs even compared to older large rack servers. But this computer defaults to home use and not as a server.
 Does it make sense to buy this computer as a 24/7 server to host my online store? In fact, it will be just one Ubuntu system or virtualization with two systems. The website will be made mainly in PHP + mysql. My main concerns are the inability to use ecc memory and the processor, although its parameters are impressive 12-cores 16-threads maybe it&#x27;s not a processor that can handle the load generated by hundreds of users on a website so well?
 Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have room for a bigger server at home - rack servers are very noisy and smaller ones like the proliant micorserver are still quite big. An additional advantage of nuc is practically zero power consumption during idle

                              <span>I was frustrated last week with various tickets along the lines of &quot;Microphone doesn&#x27;t work&quot; and no more information. 
 This morning it occurred to me I could use Bing AI to help, so I thought about adding a field in our ticketing system that concatenates &quot;You are an IT support engineer. Please compose an answer that is sympathetic, friendly, helpful and concise to the following problem reported to you by a user:&quot; along with the complaint from the ticket.
 The idea is if the incoming ticket is too vague, the technician can just copy and paste the contents of that field in Bing chat to get the basis for their reply, making minor customizations to personalize the reply depending on the circumstances. 
 Thoughts? Suggestions for how I can improve this?

                              <span>I honestly don&#x27;t care the effectiveness of SmartScreen.
 I just want to let the warning sign on Windows Security icon in system tray gone forever, so my users will not bother me with &quot;what has happened with Windows Security&quot; tickets.
 https://i.imgur.com/sjhc0NY.png
 ​
 This is what I have tried:
 First, turn on &quot;Smart SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge&quot;. This can be made possible by enable two GPO entries:
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Defender SmartScreen &gt; Microsoft Edge &gt; Configure Windows Defender SmartScreen
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Microsoft Edge &gt; SmartScreen settings &gt; Configure Microsoft Defender SmartScreen (need Microsoft Edge policy templates file to work, or use Registry)
 Next, try to turn on &quot;Potentially unwanted app blocking&quot;.
 I only find what enables &quot;Block downloads&quot;:
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Microsoft Edge &gt; SmartScreen settings &gt; Configure Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block potentially unwanted apps
 I also have tried to enable this:
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Microsoft Defender Antivirus &gt; Configure detection for potentially unwanted applications , but this alone can&#x27;t turn &quot;block apps&quot; on.
 ​
 So this is what the Windows Security looks like after I done all of things above:
 https://i.imgur.com/pfYIrLN.png
 ​
 I saw others turned &quot;block apps&quot; on but struggle to figure out turing &quot;Block downloads&quot; on:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/o0a65w/enable_potentially_unwanted_apps/
 But this guy did not say anything about how they turn &quot;block apps&quot; on.
 ​
 So has anyone ever tried to fix the system tray icon of Windows Security, and successfully turn the PUA completely on? Typing admin passwords on 100+ PCs at my location does not seems to be a sane solution that a sysadmin will pick.

 I can’t find anything in Microsoft docs and nothing from any other source online. Any help is appreciated right now I’m looking at how to check health of domain.

                              <span>My gosh, our sales manager approached IT to ask if we could get a new iphone for one of the three new hires, as the two other new hires received new ones and he received a used device. We explained him that the process is to issue devices that we have in stock first, unless there is a very good (e.g. medical) reason why a different device should be used. He didn&#x27;t like that and went on and complained that this wouldn&#x27;t be fair etc. Being in charge,I looked him in the eyes and asked what was wrong with the device, as it was in a technical fine condition and it had been cleaned well by my colleague before it was handed over; Of course he didn&#x27;t have an answer, but still more or less demanded to get a new phone ordered. After telling him that we just stuck to a totally common process and that he would have to get those changed, he went away and hasn&#x27;t been seen again that day (turned out he went to hr to ask for a change of the process and this eventually went all the way up). We are by far no huge company where something like this might be typical, but even if, just feeling this entitlement from sales all the time (I could fill pages with examples of them causing issues and collateral damage everywhere) in combination with such a pointless, unjustified, wasteful demand almost made me respond in a rather unprofessional way (my answers might have been emotional here and there,but professional).
 Is it just me or have some people just lost touch of what makes someone a successful worker?

                              <span>I am looking to deploy 20-30 Aruba AP-315 over POE to form a single strong wifi network across a building. Is there some advantage to deploying them in Instant mode compared to Campus mode? Seems like people here always talk about Instant mode but that then requires flashing every AP since AP hardware seems to be cheaper on eBay than IAP. Seems like added work compared to plugging all into a compatible switch. 
 And if I wanted to run Campus mode is there some cheap aruba switch I can buy on eBay that can control all of these APs without needing to buy special licenses? For example could I use a 48port s3500 to connect all of the access points, or would I need a separate controller?
 Trying to figure out the cheapest and simplest way to do this.

                              <span>Hi everyone, we have a velo which has a probable hardware failure since both our wan links is not being detected.
  
We like try to reset first the velo. Does doing a hard/soft reset changes the configuration on the orchestrator? or it only affects the edge device and when the edge device finally reboots would automatically import the configurations on the orchestrator? Or should we just do a complete reactiviation? How does each actions affevt tje edge and config from the orchestrator?
 
Does Reactivation automatically sends the software version and config to the new velo? What things should I look for after doing a reactivation?

                              <span>Got brought into a use case where an end user needs to VPN into Azure, and then that azure subscription/resources also Site 2 Site IPSEC VPN&#x27;s over to another location that has a machine the end user is trying to reach. When I came into this effort to help a buddy, it was setup already using native Azure VPN gateway/etc.... there&#x27;s also an Azure Firewall but it&#x27;s not doing much currently. So the main issue is the distant end with the server wants the client to only come across the VPN using one public IP.... here&#x27;s the fun part... for Azure VPN DHCP Pools it has to be a /29 or greater... so I can&#x27;t just issue the client one public and call it a day. Additionally, the S2S VPN is using policy based traffic selectors and as such I can&#x27;t also turn on NAT to turn a private pool into one &quot;port overloaded&quot; public IP. I also apparently can&#x27;t just slap a NAT Gateway in there because when I attach a private subnet to it, and try to use that same subnet for VPN pool addresses, it throws overlap errors.
 ​
 So I guess in summary..... what is the right design strategy for this situation given the technical limitations (oh and they can&#x27;t change their end until the next change window next week if we need to try anything, so we&#x27;re just trying to figure out what we can do from our Azure end for now, if anything).
 ​
 Part of me thinks I should just slap a Palo VM on there, do globalprotect and a site 2 site and let the palo take care of NAT without complaining like Azure has been at me, but palo&#x27;s are like $6k a month in azure, and part of me wonders if I should be using azure&#x27;s native firewall in the mix in some way to help the situation or if I&#x27;m not using other native features correctly enough to get this straight.
 ​
 Any advice is appreciated, sorry for the wall of text, and RIP my favorite 3rd party reddit app soon &#x3D;[

                              <span>I’ve been using Catalyst switches and Aironet APs forever.
 Management SW has never been amazing but we don’t use it much. Making the move from Prime to DNAC at the moment mostly just for reports and assurance. 
 Of course licensing sucks and issues pop up but the HW is overall really stable and reliable.
 But now it feels like Cisco is trying to push us all to Meraki everything now and I’m a little worried. Never used Meraki before.
 Anybody have experience making the transition?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious what others think. There seems to be two camps: one that says separate your 2.4GHz and 5GHz SSIDs, and the other that says (if its available in your platform) leverage band steering to force capable clients to the 5GHz spectrum.
 We&#x27;re slowly converting some ANCIENT Wi-Fi deployments to Meraki and trying to clean up various Wi-Fi-related problems in our environment, like rogue networks (thanks, HP printers!) and such. Meraki is naturally all about their band steering, but when we work with tools like Ekahau, they preach separate SSIDs per band. Part of me also feels that while band steering might work &#x27;most of the time,&#x27; there still might be some random issues that may crop up.
 What have you found works best, especially in large/multi-story deployments and/or using Meraki?

I can ping one to the other over IPv4 on the other interfaces which are part of another VLAN.

 Just curious if anybody has run into this previously, as it startled me when I first encountered it, and is rapidly becoming a major issue for my organization. I&#x27;m currently an engineer on a project to replace a roughly 8k site DMVPN deployment with a new SD-WAN router/firewall platform. We have everything from 800/1900/2900/3900 to 1100 series ISRs that we&#x27;re trying to get off the wire. What we&#x27;re finding is that there are tons of devices on our network with static IPs that h…</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 We have Aruba (2530 series generally) as our core switches (18&#x27;ish) - and the oldest are soon to be replaced with Aruba CX-6100 series switches. There are 10 VLANs in place, with a few extra for very small needs.
 Sometimes we have need, where new cable runs aren&#x27;t feasible, to add access switches. For these &#x27;access switches&#x27;, we had been using low-end Netgear, TP-Link etc as it was expedient and we weren&#x27;t experiencing any issues, nor were we actively monitoring the switches (no issue contributes to low priority).
 Troubleshooting/contributing factors to question
 However, I started to try and put in better equipment and noted Zyxel had very functionality (SNMP, good CLI, etc) and have since noticed strange issues. We started with 2 of these, and I had LoopGuard enabled - within…</span>

                              <span>I currently have FortiManager deployed (at this point, we are still using it basically to maintain firmware and nothing more) and hundreds of Fortigate firewalls in the field.
 I am evaluating several SD-WAN solutions (I know, this is poorly defined) basically replacing the firewalls with bridge devices that build a software defined network back to a gateway and egress internet from that gateway (Ala Velocloud). In this scenario, the clients provider IPs are decoupled from the egress IP that traffic comes from. (We have several clients that utilize whitelisted only services, so ISP failovers or replacements are challenging)
 I am looking to utilize client managed circuits, not a fully managed SD-WAN where they want to define the circuits, install new circuits, add MPLS, etc..
 ​
 Is this what Fortinet&#x27;s offering is? It seems their SD-WAN information that I had found was leveraging the central management capabilities of Fortimanager, but still requiring the purchase and licensing of a fortigate firewall at each site. This seems more like &quot;centralized configuration&quot; than SD-WAN, so egress traffic still changes IPs and such when circuits fail, etc.

 It sounds like we are dead in the water. Does anyone know off-hand if migrating to Duo Mobile ASA SSL VPN using Duo Single Sign-On requires the DLTSV1.2 connectivity support? We are currently using Duo LDAPS integration with SSL VPN.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Looking into an issue where we are seeing long authentication times sporadically for certain users. (20~ seconds)
 After analysing packets on client, AP and in DC, it appears the delay is happening on the windows clients (we only have windows clients) In windows event logs there is a significant delay that matches the packet capture.
 After the windows clients receive the server hello, along with certs, server key exchange and cert request, it does not respond for 20 seconds, in this time the AP retransmits the last packet 3 times before client responds.
 This is a common occurrence for some, and rare for others, there are different generations of laptops in the company however we don’t see any correlation there.
 Has anyone experienced this before, I can’t find anything! Are there any windows logs anyone can recommend to narrow down our investigation?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to best setup a wireless mesh network network that utilizes multiple gateways in order to minimize the amount of hops needed to reach WAN.
 Say we have a very long linear mesh (bunch of nodes on a string) in a tunnel. For each hop we loose some throughput, so if we only have one router as the gateway at say one of the ends, at the other end we will have much decreased performance. I could setup the mesh such that the nodes at the first third will use router A as the gateway, the next third uses router B and the last third uses router C. This works fine, except we of course get dropped connections every time we roam from one third to another and the routers don&#x27;t act as a failover for each other. Additionally, the roaming is slower when effectively switching between networks.
 One topology I&#x27;ve thought about it having each of routers A,B and C use another fourth router D as their gateway such that then at least at the connections come from the same place and then perhaps it would be possible to perhaps have a stable phone call throughout the tunnel when roaming.
 Problem is that I&#x27;m frankly a little too green to figure this out entirely on my own. I guess what I&#x27;m looking for is called multi-WAN or multi-home? What sort of topology and/or setups would you use in this situation?

                              <span>Hello, we have an ASR9006 with dual RSP 440 cards with 12GB of RAM each.
 We have had to disable some BGP sessions because BGP started to complain that it was out of memory. However &#x27;show memory&#x27; shows this:

                              <span>Hi,
 On my infra, we switched to simple network access to link aggregates (bonding) and vlan trunking on the bond interfaces, I mean server side. 
 Nothing exotic. But since then we noticed with wireshark a lot of TCP issues : out of order, dup ack and retransmission 
 I first thought that routing was messy but I tested with tcp traceroute everywhere and I saw nothing wrong.
 I thought about MTU but it seems ok (tested with ping with 1500 size and no fragmentation).
 I’m not a networking guy, I work on a bare metal kubernetes infra. The networking team says that there is nothing wrong on switches/routers at first sight. 
 These errors appears even on same LAN connections. 
 Where would you look at to debug this ?

                              <span>for the love of good, even second hand market. $10 per keyboard and $10per mouse all day long. i flippin love the keyboards above and beyond any keyboard on the planet from which im typing now. odd post sure, influenced by some good whiskey, but bringing a thought ive had for too many years. 10+ years, same awesome keyboard, $10/ea. never less. even in bulk. whats the deal? what else retains crazy value in the IT world? i recently noticed unifi switches which arent even fantastic dont even go below 50% on second hand market. how do an enterprise servers lose 90% value within 3 years but these keyboards maintain 100% pricing? quite the phenomena if i may say so.

                              <span>Testing setup:
 Windows AD Ubuntu 20.04 client joined to domain via SSSD. Horizon view connection to client with smart card passthrough.
 Client sees smartcard, able to do all auth with pam_pkcs11 right now but trying to swap to SSSD.
 Right now the cert on our cards is issued by different federal agency. But I can grab the Serial # and subject strings and toss into AltSecIdentities field in my AD.
 UID on my domain matches UID on the card. 
 When I toss pam_sss.so into sudo and attempt to auth I&#x27;m seeing p11_child looking through my certs on the card but never actually matching anything. Eventually the sudo attempt shows &quot;please enter smart card&quot; and then drops to ask to password after p11 gives up.
 My pam_pkcs11 config just has a mapper to look at the UID on the card, see it&#x27;s joeschmoo and match that to my domain user joeschmoo.
 SSSD seems unable to do this and not sure what I&#x27;m missing now.
 (Not at laptop currently but will upload config once I get back. Very basic config though with just pam_cert_auth set to true and pam DB pointing at sssd_ca_db.pem)

                              <span>maybe once a year, i take a look at moving away from our current patching solution: WSUS as our single repo to reduce WAN usage; BatchPatch for manually performing prepatch operations (stopping our in-house middleware services) and initiating the download/install/reboot cycle; PRTG for server health monitoring/alerts to on-call, alerts which need to be acknowledged or ignored during the patch window so as not to fire off PagerDuty calls.
 so far, i haven&#x27;t found anything that feels like a worthwhile upgrade/replacement. i think the main things working against my search are these:
  
we need to issue a &quot;Stop-Service -Name MiddleWareApp&quot; to ensure connections to the servers are stopped and drained before beginning patch installation
 we need to manually acknowledge all the server alarms that follow (CPU usage &gt; 95%; host not pinging during the post-patch reboot; etc.)
  
we&#x27;ve been using PRTG for many years and we do like that it supports fully agent-less monitoring of essentially ALL the things we care about. WMI for Windows, SNMP for Linux/appliances, and so on. but, it feels very, very stuck in the past. like, it&#x27;s 2023 and they still do not support recurring maintenance window scheduling, or rules like &quot;only alert if the alarm threshold has been exceeded for X scan intervals&quot;. maddening.
 the handful of other products i&#x27;ve tried -- PDQdeploy, ManageEngine Patch Manager, Automox, Level dot io -- do not (at the time i tested each one) support pre- or post-patch scripting, e.g., stop the specified service and wait for the process to terminate before beginning patching. naturally, i&#x27;m tired of doing it manually in BatchPatch but i just haven&#x27;t found a solid replacement yet.
 i have about 140 Windows servers (98% VM&#x27;s) that i need to deal with.
 please give me recommendations on products and/or process improvements that you&#x27;ve found to make this task easier. thanks!

 Do all levels of admins do that (domain admin vs. just admin access to specific servers)?
 Do you have a naming convention you like? Regular account: HJS and an HJS_Admin?
 Do you use a product to manage this?

He originally ran an MSP for years before the company decided to bring him on as Director of IT since he was at their office every day as it stood.
 I started about a year ago, hired into a senior role in charge of infrastructure and security as well as building out a helpdesk to pass off to an eventual end user support manager. Prior to this, he had no management experience other than a summer intern, so this was a two …</span>

                              <span>Today my manager, who is the assistant director of IT, offered me a position as a junior cybersecurity analyst. I work in small-medium grocery store company in the helpdesk and the company currently does not have anyone working in a security role so they are looking for someone internally to possibly fulfill that position in a junior role.
 I feel like I should jump at the role immediately as it&#x27;s a significant promotion but to be completely honest I&#x27;m just not sure if I want to go into the security route. I&#x27;m still attending school as a computer science major and only have one semester left for this fall to graduate. I&#x27;ve been leaning more towards doing something in web development instead, however, I also feel like I may be throwing away a huge opportunity to get a job right away while still in my last semester and not deal with the stress of looking for a job after graduating with little experience. I&#x27;m thinking of taking the job, gaining the experience, and if I still feel like I&#x27;d rather do web development jump into that after a year of doing security.
 Would it be wise to just take the opportunity and see what happens? Or should I only accept the role if I feel I have a future in security? I don&#x27;t want to screw the company or myself over for the future. I&#x27;m definitely open and willing to try out a new field and do what is necessary to do well in the position but am unsure if I&#x27;m making the right decision. I appreciate any advice you guys can offer.

                              <span>We were using a product called Workspace made by Stoneware. It allowed users to access data on shares that they have access to. So for example, when they were on-prem and logged into a machine, they would automatically have a &quot;T:&quot; drive assigned for whatever. This product allowed them to see all the stuff in their &quot;T:&quot; drive in a webpage and they&#x27;d have to download and upload the files via a somewhat clunky interface. It wasn&#x27;t ideal, but it worked.
 Well apparently they&#x27;ve up and pulled the plug on this product so we&#x27;re scrambling for a replacement. Does anyone have any recommendations? The only real wants/requirements are:
  
SAML compatible so we can SSO
 Ease of use (the last one&#x27;s interface was blech)
 Web-based would be great
  
We have a Palo Alto firewall and are currently allowing people to VPN in for this, but that&#x27;s cumbersome for lots of our users. Does anyone have any suggestions for allowing our users to access their files when off-prem? An aspect of the PA or a backend product - any suggestions appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I got a call on my Teams number and normally with no caller ID (ie. number only) I don&#x27;t answer, but then I took a second look. It was one of our company&#x27;s own DIDs. So just because I know scammers will spoof numbers close to yours I let it finish. Then the same number rang my mobile. So I answered it. It was some rep from RingCentral saying he had spoken to me before. I have zero recollection of that and told him we are on Teams with an EA and local telco for Direct Routing so we&#x27;re not interested and hung up. 
 The fact that a somewhat reputable company is spoofing numbers looks really bad if not illegal. I wouldn&#x27;t consider them for my business now because of this. I&#x27;m in Canada so really not sure what the rules are. I hate sales people. I don&#x27;t understand how this could be allowed.

                              <span>Hello!
 First of all, thank you for just reading. I&#x27;m not a IT guy but know a little bit. 
 With my family we are starting a company (at the moment 6 workers). Right now each one of us save their documents in their own computer, so when someone needs a document other person has it has to be sent by mail (I know, it&#x27;s a disaster). We have a limited budget. I was reading that the best option could be a NAS server with RAID. The brand I mostly hear is Synology. We use W7, W10 and MacOs. Wich server do you recommend me for our needs? We need to have remote access in case we are not in the office btw.
 Thanks in advance for any advice :)
 Edit:
 Thank you all for your advices. Many has suggested using cloud. However I had a bad experience with OneDrive (lost information). For me there are three advantages of not using cloud. 1 You only pay once/not monthly payment (as far as I know, so in long term is cheaper) 2 can use your files even if there&#x27;s not internet 3 easier to make backups.
 However I will be open minded

 How should I manage such a commute? I unfortunately do not have any other job offers so this is the only one I can take. It’s this or continue to being unemployed

 I am going to use a portial of the storage for my ESXi server over iSCSI, and about 25TB for backup&#x27;s and other storage of files. 
 So I am wondering what&#x27;s the best method to consider, do I setup the drives in SHR-2 or RAID 6? And what about the SSD as a cache drive?

However, they have an SPF record that has the sending network IP listed that would allow the message. Shouldn&#x27;t those two records be set the same and they just messed up? Or am I the cause of the problem by having my system care about SIDF and I just need to set it to check SPF?

                              <span>Not sure if there is someone that can point me in the right direction. Doing a costing exercise (so this may all come to nothing). Is there an open source and/or free licensing SBC that is compatible with Teams? Started going through them, and so far the best one seems to be ultratel, however, it would potentially be better (and cheaper) for our own to be hosted. 
 The idea is to cost savings on telephony, while keeping scalability for the predicted growth. The current vendor is pretty competitive, but, as with growth we have already had, I think we can drive down cost per user without impacting performance.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I would like to change the sharepoint domain name to another one. 
 Example:
 companyB.sharepoint.com(companyA.sharepoint.com to companyB.sharepoint.com
 (both domains are active already in the administration portal) 
 I found some official documentation On how to do it.
 But I&#x27;m not aware of the potential impact on a running Microsoft 365 infrastructure.
 Would there be impact?
 Any tips?

Teams is installed with the same bitness as Outlook. These options exist on physical PCs. The known issues and limitations has nothing on this, unsure if not really a limitation or just not documented.
 Is anyone else experiencing this? Do we have a misconfig somewhere?
 Thanks,

Their line remains stripped with the &quot;No information&quot; tag, even when I receive their &quot;Meeting accepted&quot; confirmation mail.
 Internal users are synced without any issue. 
 Is there something I have to allow somewhere ?

                              <span>A recommendation to you all in here - do a spoof test on https://emailspooftest.com
 This was my results - anyone know how to solve those that only got F grade? We use Microsoft Defender.
 Control test - valid email - Grade: A
 Fake subdomain protection - Enforced: Grade: A
 BEC fake insider protection - Enforced: Grade: A
 Look-a-like protection - Grade: F
 Domain attack protection - Grade: F
 Subdomain attack protection - Grade: F
 ​
 This is their explanation for the failures:
 E7:
 SPF is not enforced.
 Fix: Set email systems to reject email from servers that fail SPF checks.
 DNS Settings for badSPF.com
 DMARC &#x3D; Not configured (Neutral)
 SPF &#x3D; Reject all
 [v&#x3D;spf1 -all]
 DKIM &#x3D; email not signed (Selector &#x3D; default)
 [selector &#x3D; default, v&#x3D;DKIM1; k&#x3D;rsa; p&#x3D;MIIB...]
 E8:
 SPF reject all is not enforced for subdomains.
 Fix: Set email systems to reject email from servers that fail SPF checks.
 DNS Settings for badSPF.com
 DMARC &#x3D; Not configured (Neutral)
 SPF &#x3D; Reject all
 [v&#x3D;spf1 -all]
 DKIM &#x3D; email not signed (Selector &#x3D; default)
 [selector &#x3D; default, v&#x3D;DKIM1; k&#x3D;rsa; p&#x3D;MIIB...]
 E10:
 Reverse DNS is not enforced.
 Fix: On inbound email gateways, enable DNS lookups. Tip: If you host your own gateways make sure you have enough resources.

 About a month ago as I was coordinating the logistics of a computer roll out, a staff member at the site grabed her keychain and turned on the air conditioning using the key. I then learned that every Union member had a key as it was part of the bargaining agreement.
 The next day I went on Amazon and purchased a key for $6.99

 Same behavior when firewall and EDR are turned off. Opening UPS causes it to open and close instantly, tried reinstalls and different machines with same behavior. Master station works normally on same network.

 I&#x27;m not sure if this is the cause but my client&#x27;s network did packet shaping to limited the bandwidth in the network so it cause the update patch to failed to download

                              <span>Hey guys.
 We have a few Dell R720 servers with a PERC H710P Mini Raid controller. We bought a few Samsung 1643a SAS SSD drives that we would like to use to extend the life of these old servers a bit.
 When installing the drives, they were properly recognized, they show up in IDRAC. I set up a new Virtual Disk, configured the RAID array, did a fast initialization (as the drives were brand new), everything went smoothly.
 However, on reboot, it took a very long time for the server to start, and it stops at the PERC initialization with the message &quot;Adapter at Baseport is not responding. No adapter&quot; and fails to continue to boot.
 Removing the drives, the adapter is initialized and the machine boots.
 I also tried adding the drives while I was in the BIOS RAID utility, and it&#x27;s the same, as via IDRAC. The drives get recognized, RAID array configuration works, but upon reboot, it stops with the same error message.
 Before the error message pops up, the drives&#x27; LEDs blink slowly, sequentially (one after the other). After a few minutes, they all blink fast. I let it be for a few hours, but did not change the results.
 Here are some other things I tried already:
  
firmware/bios update - everything is up to date
 only connected 1/2/4/6 drives at a time
 removed other drives in the enclosure
 perform a full initialization of the raid array from the BIOS RAID utility
 opened up the server and checked the cables, battery, reseated the adapter
 used another identical server
  
Any idea of what might be wrong?
 Anyone else use this combo R720/H710P/1643a?
 Thanks a bunch!

                              <span>Small company &lt;20 users / M365 Business Premium + Intune and AIP
 I&#x27;m aware that services exist to deal with spam etc like Mimecast, Proofpoint. But for a small company like ours, it seems a bit OTT.
  
 The issue I have is the methods provided in the M365 estate either don&#x27;t seem to work very well or are patchy.
  
In transport rules I have tried specific email, targeted words, domain blocks etc
 In Configuration Analyser we are set to strict
 Anti- Phish/Spam/Malware all on + Safe Links and Attachments
  
All the usual things I guess are on or active.
 Even tried blocking within the Phish and Spam settings
 But stuff just seems to be able to evade it?
 If I set an alert for e.g. on an incoming email I have blocked I might get a couple, and then I find it in the quarantine again the next day.
  
 Currently, I have to view the quarantine every day and delete anything suspect. Even for a small company like us, it&#x27;s 100 a day +. But we find this is too quick for the users sometimes and stuff they need gets removed. 
 We did wonder if there is a script or something to delete them over &quot;x&quot; days to save my time going every day?
 We tell them to use the Block /Allow emails and add them to their contacts, but I doubt many do
  
 We did also wonder about allowing stuff to be active in the quarantine so they moderate and release their own stuff, dunno how safe that will be though.
  
 How are we actually supposed to keep this stuff out?
 I know everyone has a method, but what is the correct way to keep this stuff blocked?
 Or the correct sections to use that will help.
  
 Or is there no answer?

                              <span>Just a short Friday rant.
 Just got Our annual renewal of the maintenance of Our Cerberus FTP software (profesional edition). 
 I got notified that they had changed from regular 1 year renewal to 3 Year contracts (paid yearly). 
 Then i get the quota .. last year the renewal of same edition was 336$ for 1 Year, now it&#x27;s 999$ a Year
 &quot;3 Year Subscription — $999.00 Paid Annually &quot; and in checkout &quot;Renewal 3 Year Subscription, Price Per Year&quot;
 I&#x27;ve sent their sales team an email if this can be correct price for 1 year...
 the change from 1 year normal renewal to 3 year contract is pretty bad, but if the price jump is real...
 Cancel maintenance, let it run for a few months before i setup a new ftp server.
 Good weekend everybody!

 The two processes that needs the most ressources are the svchost.exe with netprofm and RPCSS.
 Had somebody the same problems and has it resolve?
 If we install a clean RDS2022 Host with the exact Software / GPOs which is not Member of the Session Collection everythins works without problems.
 Our RDS2016 RDS Host Server, which are members of the session collection run fine.

 Does anyone have any means of getting hold of sales there? For 3 weeks we&#x27;ve been calling and the phone never gets answered. You leave a vm and send emails and still notta thing. I initially spoke with some entry level sales person who took the query which was hugely simple pricing question and since its like the whole organisation doesnt exist!
 Its for £100K + order too, which isn&#x27;t the biggest I accept but it must mean something.
 Any tips please!? (before I lose my mind)

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

 Either the PC won&#x27;t turn on, or functionality is limited. The current solution to this is power resetting the PC every time. 
 Any idea if this is caused by a recent Windows/Firmware update?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got an issue reported by a client, that has me completely stumped, and isn&#x27;t something myself, or the team has seen before.
 We have a Dell Latitude 5530 that had its motherboard replaced 2-3 months ago due to graphical issues when plugged into a dock (WD19S) - this is a somewhat ongoing issue but is separate.
 Starting today, the laptop has refused to power on unless it is plugged into a Dell Dock.The laptop doesn&#x27;t power on, or show any sign of life, when disconnected from all devices or plugged into a power adapter/charger.I&#x27;ve tried a few chargers that all work without issues on other devices, so it&#x27;s definitely not a charger issue.
 If you boot up the laptop whilst plugged into the dock, and then unplug, it works seamlessly, as if there were no issues at all. Restarting the device when unplugged is completely fine, it&#x27;s just shutting down/booting up
 Is this something anyone has experienced before, or has any basic troubleshooting steps I could look at as a starting point?

                              <span>We grew a bit over the past years and information security is rearing its head. We still got no events, but are aware that this mostly out of luck and not skill. We are already conducting an annual security training, will be implementing MFA for our accounts soon and started looking at phishing and social engineering testing campaigns.
 I remember reading about research comparing different information security tools, but my google fu is failing me and I get mostly corporate spam stuff. I remember seeing comparisons between training and training plus testing and how both combined are much more effective than either in their own. I did find a cambrige paper about cost-effectiveness across threat vectors and industries, but not about countermeasures.

 Higher ups are engineers mostly and data always works to prioritize the right approach, so I am currently looking for that right now.

                              <span>I am reaching out to seek your expertise and assistance with a task I&#x27;m currently working on. I have a text file containing log lines, and I need to scan these lines for specific destination IP addresses and extract certain fields from them.
 The IPs I want to scan the lines for are around 50, so I need to feed the script these 50 IP addresses as IP1, IP2, and so on.
 The field for destination IP is dst_ip in the log below and the same line has protocol, and dst_port fields.
 And then extract the fields highlighted below: dst_ip, protocol, and dst_port
 I would prefer if this can be done in CMD with a batch file on windows, as my experience with python scripting and so on is very beginner level, but I am open to try out suggestions.
 Here&#x27;s a log snippet:

 I tried various ways in notepad++ but could not meet these requirements, I believe this can be done much fasted in a batch script or python script.

 There is no clear explanation for the error on the part of the jedox support and as a sysadmin I am too far away to judge whether it is software or user error.
 But my feeling tells me that it is more about problems on the part of the software and its cloud infrastructure.
 Does anyone else use this software and are currently experiencing similar things?

                              <span>Hi,
 we are working in hybrid exchange environment and our mails get scanned by Microsoft 365 Defender. Since I am the &quot;mail guy&quot; I have to say that Defender Quarantine options are limited and that is why I am asking the sysadmin community to help me out in recommending an additional product or software which can deliver more granularity and control over how spam e-mail is handled. 
 On to the explanations:
  
I just want to be able to block certain senders, block certain swear words from EVER reaching the quarantine. I dont want to blacklist e-mails so they do eventually land in quarantine, I want to delete them.
 Please do not mention transport rules, yes they do exist but I would like to move away from Microsoft in this case.
 The product should not cost a bazillion € since we are a small company, I am not searching for free, but also some high end enterprise solution is out of our scope.
 The product should support integration with O365 and should be in the cloud.
  
Cheers!

 It&#x27;s only the tail directory on each row that needs to be moved but it must include everything in it (including subfolders and files) AND if the folder is empty, the folder itself.

                              <span>Making this post on the off chance anyone experiences what I did. Because it was a huge pain and I found no resources online, plus Lenovo’s premium tech support couldn’t help over the phone.
 Long story short: Borked Windows install on tower and wanted to run an official recovery install rather than a clean one. Recovery Creator was failing to create the installer USB drive.
 Steps initially taken:
  
 Placed online digital order for recovery
  Inserted a flash drive
  Downloaded Lenovo USB Recovery Creator and ran it
  Signed in and selected my digital order
  Let it download the media
  Allowed it to attempt to create the USB recovery key
  
At this point it failed, with a number of errors mentioning that it could no longer find the flash drive and that it failed at partitioning the drive.
 Checked disk management and found it had created a RAW 32GB partition and left the rest of the space unallocated. Looked like it failed after that initial partitioning, right before formatting.
 What it took to get it to work:
 Disk management failed every time I tried to manually repartition or in any way ‘fix’ the USB drive.
 I had to use diskpart, select the disk, clean it, create partition primary. After this I was able to successfully modify the drive through disk management again.
 Some more testing and I discovered you basically have to manually create the 32GB FAT32 partition on a flash drive and most importantly, assign it a letter. Make sure to leave the rest of the drive space unallocated. Then use the recovery creator to actually write the media and create the recovery USB.
 Don’t manually create and format the partition? The recovery creator will try to do it itself and fail. Messing up your flash drive and requiring diskpart to fix.
 Don’t assign a drive letter after partitioning and formatting? Recovery creator will simply fail.
 Best of luck to anyone who may come across this in their time of need.

                              <span>For a yet unclear reason, around 06.06.2023 (exact time is unclear though) our scan to mail setup started breaking with our Epson printers (WF-C20600 Series).
 I read and reread this article a few times and I don&#x27;t see what I did wrong there.
 Previously I had a connector set up but after I read &quot;Doesn&#x27;t work with a connector; never configure a device to use a connector with direct send because such a configuration can cause problems.&quot; I removed the printers public IP from the connector.
 What happens is that for some devices only every third or so scan is successfully send while all other scan jobs produce an NG 313 error code (A communication error has occurred.)
  
SPF record is there
 Printer are NATed to the same public IP which is white-listed (https://i.imgur.com/DsGZuEK.png)
 Tried TLS/StartTLS and without, didn&#x27;t notice a difference
 Got a packet capture but I really could not find any smoking gun here
  
Is direct send in general prone to problems?

                              <span>Hi all, I’m not really a system administrator but need some advice regarding a potential solution that could work for an office with about 5 network drives. Each of these drives is chock full of data with a very well maintained and organized folder structure/hierarchy.
 Unfortunately, data is organized by project number (and not labeled in any way that’s clear), so it makes it difficult for people to get acquainted and find files for the projects they’re working on. Additionally, since there are so many nested directories, it can take clicking through multiple levels before realizing whether you’re in the right directory to start with.
 Is there a good, ready/easy to deploy system that can create a clean searchable directory of directories and file paths? I’m imaging something where the project number or project name could be entered, and then all various paths relating to the project could show up with labels to make it clear (i.e., Floor Plans: P:/00-1020202-22/Ar/FP/, Mechanical: P:/General Resources/MechanicalCAD/).
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>I moved to a new company which is trying to deploy Openstack with Cisco ACI, since I am the one with the most experience with Openstack. Deployed it a number of times before but never with ACI.
 The problem here is that I kept getting You have held Broken Packages. whenever I try to integrate Openstack with ACI, specifically the neutron-aci-opflex plugin. All other components are already working and ready including the neutron-api-plugin-aci.
 Perhaps I am missing something? Cisco support is not really helpful here, so I am looking at the community right now.
 To everyone who have a Cisco ACI infra, How many of you guys successfully did this? What’s your process? Currently using juju for this, since it’s the only opensource deployment supported by Cisco.
 (please don’t mention vendors support like Redhat\Canonical, we are already looking at it, please instead tell your story or experience working with this kind of setup)

                              <span>Looking into netopeer2 and comparing with confd in terms of setting up the call home.
 This is the callhome.xml which specifies the parameters and settings for a NETCONF client to establish a connection to a NETCONF server using the Call Home mechanism however it doesn&#x27;t contain the;
  
the port for Call Home i.e, 4334
 the port required for NETCONF one of which could be 7022
  
Whereas in confd, there&#x27;s a command which explicitly does the callhome confd_cmd -c &#x27;netconf_ssh_call_home 127.0.0.0 4334&#x27;
 Is netopeer much different in that regard? It&#x27;s just I can&#x27;t seem to set up communication with the client

                              <span>Boss is floating the idea of using eduroam for our campus. She had it at her previous job. We had eduroam many many years ago, just when I started working here, so not that familiar with it. The people who were around that time are no longer here so I’m not sure why we moved away from it. From what I’ve read it looks like 3rd party wireless hosting. Being the only network guy that sounds great as it may relieve a lot of responsibilities but I’ve been around long enough to know not to trust my initial instincts lol. 
 So what are your thoughts on it as far as cost, features, ease of use, fit, etc. ? We currently use clearpass w Aruba controllers and APs. We average around 1200-1500 wireless users. Mainly we provide public/unsecure and staff-only access (read: nothing fancy).

                              <span>I am working through a plan to replace some core network switches in our datacenter and wanted to solicit some advice from the community here. 
 We have three sites in a ring (more like a triangle) topology and run EIGRP as our routing protocol. Each site has a pair of core switches that handle the intersite connections. Site A connects to site B via 2x1Gb links currently in a L3 Portchannel. Site B to Site C is single 1Gb and site C back to site A is single 1Gb link (all those using L2 connection with SVI&#x27;s). Site B is getting an upgrade to Nexus cores so we will no longer be able to run a L3 PC with VPC back to Site A.
 I am curious what you guys would do with this topology. I am contemplating running routed links everywhere like this. Will EIGRP ECMP this traffic and utilize both paths by default or is their additional configuration that needs to be done? Any other pros/cons to this design?
 Another option I am tossing around is doing a simple L2-VPC and running SVI at both ends like this.
 I would love to hear your thoughts and talk through the different solutions here. Thanks in advance.

 I made some &#x27;not so critical but important to know&#x27; change on customer network and things did not get as my expectations.
 So the edge topology consist of 2x Switch and 2x router redundancy. Switches trunked for all VLAN&#x27;s.
 They use seperate eBGP on both routers for both ISP&#x27;s. One of the ISP&#x27;s use different IP&#x27;s but other one use same IP and story begins here.
 Since this ISP making two BGP with same IP but customer side is L2 neighbor, the switch buffers populated with whole MAC flap logs.
 Safety alert, this ISP is secondary for both download and upload.
 Since i saw the switch CPU load that connected to primary router for iBGP VRRP, my first assumption was these L2 flaps because the MATM process consuming %30 CPU (totaly CPU load was %60-65) and this can be easly fixed with …</span>

 Site A is our HQ: 10.x.x.x
 Site B is remote site: 10.160.x.x, connected via fiber (layer 3) 
 Everything at Site B is routed to Site A. ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.255.254.4 (core sw at site A)
 Remote Site Core: Created a new guest vlan (vlan998), Ip address 172.16.9.1 255.255.255.0 ip helper 10.10.10.24. 
 HQ: Created dhcp scope, 172.16.9.15 - .254. Gtwy 172.16.9.1
 Clients are getting dhcp, and can ping internal 10.x.x.x devices (will setup an ACL for security later after this is working). Can ping dns servers.
 172.16.9.x guests however cannot get to internet.

 Info from HQ core:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.200.1 (firewall)

 Also running OSPF so can post that if necessary.
 Firewall is allowing all IPv4-Private-All-RFC1918 networks to the outside.

                              <span>I work at an ISP and i&#x27;ve been noticing a particular MAC Adress trying to connect to the network, but it gets rejected by the firewall. I think it might be some disconnected client who never turned off their devices, but i can&#x27;t tell with only the MAC. So i had an idea: ¿What if i let it connect to my network? Create a subnet for it to connect where i know it cant cause any harm on my net nor obtain information about it. And now that i have that device in my network, look for a way of obtaining more information about him.
 All in all, i want to know from people with experience in networking if in general this would be a good idea: Let an unkown host connect to your network so you can get more information about him, but heavily controlling its traffic and permissions so he wont be able to do anything inside your net.

                              <span>Our company is migrating from Brocade/RUCKUS switches to Extreme. I managed to get one of our new Extreme switches online and passing traffic with no issue. While waiting for compatible SFP modules to arrive, I had it connected to our Brocade stack with a copper line configured for trunking on the Extreme side. 
 The SFP modules arrived and I was able to get them connected, set the VLANs, and OM3 MMC line came right up. The problem however is that once a users DHCP lease is up, if they&#x27;re connected to the Extreme switch, their device won&#x27;t obtain a new lease. When either line (fiber or copper) is connected, there&#x27;s no issue. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a routing a loop as anyone who&#x27;s lease isn&#x27;t up yet is operating fine. I confirmed the correct VLANs to communicate with our AD servers were present. 
 On the Brocade side, both lines out of the Extreme are connected to the same switch. None of our ports on any of our Brocades are configured for trunking, but is that my issue?
 ​
 Extreme:
 50, 52 configured as LAG and trunk
 1/50 fiber
 1/52 copper
 ​
 Brocade
 ports not configured as LAG or trunk
 2/2/5 fiber
 2/1/23 copper
 ​
 ​
 TLDR: Switch not passing DHCP traffic when both ports in a LAG/Trunk configuration are connected

                              <span>Hi,
 So I&#x27;m working through a new PA migration (first time ever on Palo&#x27;s) and I&#x27;m at the point now where I have the rules built and during testing I&#x27;ve been getting odd results in the logs..
 Long story short, I have amended some changes today but before I say what they are, initially I have a test VM going out to certain websites that it was only permitted access to through the use of URL category rules (not filtering profiles), this worked fine, I didn&#x27;t get the Palo Alto splash screen page that you get when you use filtering profiles, but for all intense an purposes, it worked fine. But when I go to check the logs (traffic logs), I&#x27;m seeing the machine is triggering as &quot;allowed&quot; on rules its not meant to be allowed on, so for example...I have a rule that allows all internal users to go…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 Not sure if this is a weird question or not, but the documentation I&#x27;ve sourced doesn&#x27;t seem clear, so I figured I would post it here in hopes someone has achieved what I am hoping to do.
 The company I work for uses Cradlepoint Netcloud Manager to look after all of our customer routers.
 We have about 1500 or so in the field so not that many by all accounts.
 What I am looking to do is regularly speed test all of the routers and save that information in a report or some sort of dashboard.
 It&#x27;s come to light that one of our clients, which themselves have around 150 routers, has started to experience poor speed performance across the board.
 They got notified of this issue when individual sites would start complaining about poor speeds and performance - They setup an internal spee…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 a number of ISP&#x27;s including AltNets are using DHCP to assign IP&#x27;s where in the past they would have used PPPoE. I&#x27;m just wondering why the transition &amp; how they are ensuring accountability. 
 I&#x27;ve worked for a number of global ISP&#x27;s in enterprise services but never in the broadband space so just wondering how they ensure they meet the challenge of being able to be certain that a certain IP actually belongs to a specific customer.
 It&#x27;s not that hard to change the advertised MAC &amp; IP of the device connecting to their network, I guess they could tie the customer IP to their demarc interface &amp; be certain that anything coming into their demarc is from that subscriber regardless of MAC or IP.
 Just curious as to how they meet the audibility regulatory requirement without the customer using a username &amp; password to authenticate their conenction.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Is anyone also experiencing memory leak issue in their ACX1100? We have experienced multiple occurrences of memory leak on ACX1100 installed and would require reboot to be performed as workaround for the router to be performing again. Have verified that ACX1100 due to its design limitations, memory leak is occurring due to routes and/or routing processes which the router cannot handle. Would like to know if anyone have encountered the same issue and what has been the resolution in your network scenario.
 Monitored that memory leak on the ACX persists even after upgrading JUNOS from 20.2R2-S1.3 to 20.4R1.12. Verifying with JTAC, memory leak is triggered due to device configuration but the root cause for the permanent fix is due to software PR. I am still awaiting next service release for JUNOS 20.4R3-S8 to confirm with Juniper if memory leak issue finally resolved for next service release.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Greetings:
 We are upgrading from a pair of SN2010 (eighteen 10/25Gb ports + four 100Gb ports) to a pair of SN2100 (sixteen 100Gb ports) for our TOR switches. These switches are all running the Onyx operating system.
 We have deployed several sets of SN2010 switches for us and our clients over the past four years. We decided to upgrade to SN2100 to get more port density by using 100Gb optics and breakout cables. 
 We configured a SN2100 switch and swapped it in for one of our SN2010 switches. 
 This issue we are having is that whenever we connect a host one of the four breakout pairs, the port flaps every 30 seconds. We have configured the new switch port identically to our existing switches and connected to existing hosts that have Mellanox NICs in them. 
 When we connect the same 10/25Gb breakout to another switch, we have no issues. We only experience the issue when we connect a host (server or workstation) with SFP+. 
 We&#x27;ve used a 100Gb to 25Gb converter with both an optical transceiver as well as DAC cable and get the same results; the port stays up when connected to another switch (Mellanox or other brand) and the port flaps when that same connection terminates into a host (server or workstation).
 During the time the port is up, we have connectivity.
 Any ideas what this might be or what to try next?
 Thanks in advance.

 Manager thanked me for my honesty.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am learning how to write scripts to make work easier. But at my current stage I constantly find myself relying heavily on the Microsoft docs. Like if they have an example of updating a user in AD then I will use their code as a base and customize as needed (after a couple of hours reading about how to use the parameters). When did you become confident in your ability to write scripts as a sysadmin? I&#x27;m a CS major, husband, father, working full time. I feel like my progress is super slow, because I have been trying to learn this role and balance personal responsibility. Any insight would.be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Had a situation today. Boss called about &quot;not getting&quot; an email form 33 days ago qand asking us to look for it. We use Proofpoint for spam filters, but those logs only go back 30 days. We also have another on-premise mail archiver. We found the email in that archiver and were able to extract it, and then forward it to the boss.
 He then asks us &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I get this email on the day it was sent?&quot; Well it was in the archives, so it must have gone into the mailbox. But boss was claiming he never saw it so did not believe me when I was explaining that it was delivered on XYZ date.
 Not really sure now to handle this situation. I explained we found it and recovered it from his mailbox, but I could not say why he &quot;never received it&quot;

                              <span>So recently I&#x27;ve been getting fed up at work. Typical complaints, micromanagement, mandatory overtime, off the clock work, and lots of comp-time that never seems to actually get burned. So I&#x27;ve been poking around looking for a new job while I finish my Graduate and I&#x27;m thinking about going part time to manage the workload.
 Several times I&#x27;ve been approached on Indeed or LinkedIn by various recruiters. The pitch is always the same. &quot;Hey we think youd be great for this InfoSec position/DB manager, it&#x27;s full time but fully remote and there&#x27;s no set schedule so you can work around school.&quot; There&#x27;s then 2-3 calls with someone who helps me polish my resume for the position and once I even had 3 calls with the rep and her manager to make sure I was a good fit. Then the second my resume is all dialed in BOOM! &quot;Sorry, but they just filled that position. Would you happen to be interested on their overnight part time housekeeper position though? It pays a whopping $12/hr!&quot;
 I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s incompetent recruiters, incommunicative clients, or just a straight up scam to steal my personal information or something. All I know is it&#x27;s getting old.

Right now we&#x27;re using Ivanti to push sytem updates but eventually we are moving to WSUS, not sure what there is for Dell specific updates though.

                              <span>Fucking hell
 Been tracking down an intermediate email delivery issue for the better part of a month, only to find out our gateway has blacklisted the entire AWS IP range. So any website using Amazon SES to send emails will never get delivered to our domain.
 Guess what our main website uses to send web form submissions.
 Apparently ‘cuda relies on SpamCop for its lists which you guessed it, blocks the entire AWS range.
 I originally requested a bounce back report from our website builder, who maintained that there was no issue they could see, until I pushed back last week to run a bounce back report, sure enough, 290 emails since late may were never delivered.
 Imagine spinning in circles getting this figured out with 3 vendors (host, dev, barracuda) telling me they couldn’t figure it out.
 I think I’m more surprised that no one else has reported this via Google results.

                              <span>I have a user that thinks a hacker is out to get him. They downloaded an app on their phone to show where all the microphones and cameras are hiding in their house and office to record them . When I pointed out that there was nothing on the wall where the app said there was a camera, they said it must be to small to see. They know someone was in their house because they were missing their sunglasses at home, and the glasses were on their work desk when they got to work. So the &quot;hacker&quot; also has keys to his house and our office, supposedly. They reloaded their personal laptop and then said that the BIOS is hacked because it created an X drive while reloading. His work computer is hacked because there are updates with all capital names, and some without, and that&#x27;s not how Microsoft would push out updates. Email that takes longer then a few second to receive from their personal account to their work account is because they are being intercepted, edited, and then delivered.
 Once a week I get emails with walls of text and screen shots, wanting to know things like why does the All users folder look exactly like the Program Data folder?
 Currently, they are pulling up the dev console on any financial sites (They work in accounting) and saying that the java script does not look right. I told them to make a report with the financial institutions and let them know their concerns.
 Has anyone else had to deal with people ill like this at work? What is the best course of action that you have found? I talked with HR and my supervisor, but neither acted like it was a pressing concern and suggested I ignore their emails.

                              <span>I’m extremely new to the IT world and I finally got another job interview. Teksystems Field service technician. It’s a contractor job 20/hr. I recently got sec+, a secret clearance and just 3 months of help desk technician experience from the AF. I’ve never been a contractor nor have I ever had a big adult job like this before. Just wondering if there are better places to start or if I should shoot higher? Not sure about taking the job atp in time.
 Update: what I’ve gathered from the comments is that I should take the job for experience/resume purposes, stay for at LEAST 6 months, get a job that requires me to keep my clearance and just go up from there

                              <span>Two weeks ago I read this post about PCNS 5.x https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/14440hx/apc_now_requires_you_to_pay_for_license_if_you/
 Yesterday I manually updated one of my client&#x27;s NMC3 cards with the latest (2.5.0.6) firmware version. Looking at the device via web browser after the reboot there was a banner stating:
 2.5.x is the last NMC3 firmware version that will be available without an NMC3 Support Contract.
 I spent 20 minutes on the phone with APC Support to get some idea of what this was about.
 It seems that on May 1, 2023 APC/SE announced this change, which will become effective in Q3. There will be 1, 3, and 5 year contracts ranging in price from $50 to $225 (or as TDSynnex indicates $90 to $405 MSRP).
 Here&#x27;s the only link the CSR was able to provide: https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref&#x3D;SPD_HEPN-BFRL57_EN&amp;p_enDocType&#x3D;Brochure&amp;p_File_Name&#x3D;NMC3+Support+Contract+FAQ.pdf

 First of all: I am green in this field. Like completely. I&#x27;m a computer scientist who recently graduated. I needed a break from software development and so I came across this field. I&#x27;m 27 and currently work as an IT-support at a company with 50 people. I have been here for less than 2 months and I am the only IT-personnel. I quite frankly have no idea wtf I am doing. Activities, software and terms such as Active directory (AD), Azure, MS-licenses, DHCP &amp; DNS, switches, managing networks, servers, RMM, updating critical firmware &amp; software, syncing AD with azure, securely setting up mobile devices allowing colleagues to use e.g. Outlook (and much much more) are all things that I am learning about but have never done or heard of before. I am slowly but surely getting a generel unde…</span>

                              <span>I have a user using the local Outlook client on W10. The Help Desk has pushed this issue up to the Sys Admins saying it&#x27;s a server side issue.
 The user has a basic Outlook rule they enable when they go to lunch/are out of office to forward any emails sent to them to their coworker. They enable/disable this rule when they don&#x27;t need the forwarding. However, when they try to disable this rule - it will continually re-enable itself. 
 Things we&#x27;ve tried:
 - Delete and recreate rule
 - Ran Office Repair
 - Deleted Mail Profile and recreated it
 - Ran Clean Rules Wizard
 - Delete SRS File
 We&#x27;ve confirmed other clients are not having issue. When attempting to turn off the rule in OWA, it appears to be disabling it in the local client correctly however. The opposite doesn&#x27;t work. We&#x27;re a hybrid O365 environment. I&#x27;m not understanding how this works - does anyone have any information on what would cause this or some things to try?

                              <span>The company I work for has been using OneDrive for file sharing. We have 9 physical locations in different parts of the state. Each location also has their own IP scheme. The company uses Mac&#x27;s which I am in the process of replacing and creating a domain. The users do not have unique logins at this time. The CFO wants another solution as he doesn&#x27;t like OneDrive for file storage and neither do I. If we had a domain it would be easy to implement a file server with access permissions but since we don&#x27;t have that yet I am looking for a solution. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good way to resolve this issue until the domain is in place? I know I could build a file server in Azure that everyone could access but then we have the security aspect of folders not being available. I thought about a storage device like Nasuni but again the folder permissions issue arises again. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

                              <span>Hopefully you guys may have some solutions, but i have a few critical sites that my firm manages, and we have a few different monitoring applications we use for our own server infrastructure and websites individually. The issue I am running into is if a site was to go down at 3am my time (EST not that it matters) but i am sleeping. I have push notifications on my iphone, and have them classified as Critical alerts, so it will even come through on DND mode. BUT i am asleep, so one notification sound doesnt wake me up. I need like an alarm going off that i must dismiss, or separate device to deal with this. 
 I am hoping that there are others out there that might have a simple and good solution they have setup. I know there are enterprise level services that can do this type of thing, but I am a small business and that would most likely be too costly and unnecessary. Any ideas or recommendations to check out would be appreciated.

                              <span>Good morning all!
 -So yesterday, we started experiencing Outlook PRE in all of its glory.
 -a few end-users (who swear they didn&#x27;t click the &quot;try the new Outlook&quot; toggle) ended up with Outlook Pre and it was stuck pinned to their taskbars with no way to unpin it?? On top of that, it bricked their Office 365 install AND broke their MFA so we had to reactivate their 2FA on all of those devices just to get it working again.
 -I have found some registry changes online to remove the toggle for new Outlook, but I am not sure if this is the same thing as the Windows Mail app seems to be gone on these workstations as well. While we ALL know one thing - end users lie lol, we also know Microsoft likes to use us as their beta test guinea pigs sometimes..
 ​
 -How TF do we stop this? so far it has only been a few workstations, but since it is bricking their 365 AND their 2FA, this could turn into a management nightmare and bury our guys fast. Anybody have suggesstions? My google-fu hasn&#x27;t led me to a KB or anything pushing this program, but is creating a monitored service for that registry key that disables the toggle our best option?

 I have a ton of Powershell scripts that send and receive SFTP transfers using the WinSCP dll. Does anyone know of an alternative that isn&#x27;t OSS that you could recommend?

                              <span>Yesterday I tried to connect via RDP to my TS460 server running Win2019 Standard and there was no response. Ping didn&#x27;t respond as well. Remoting in via TMM showed only a black screen. 
 After restarting the server everything was ok. SEL showed entries &quot;DDR4_A2: Correctable ECC Asserted&quot; around 60 times a minute before the restart. 
 Windows also reported WHEA warnings (hardware error occurred). After restart, server has been running for a day now without any warning or error. It&#x27;s located at a remote location, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to reseat DIMMs. RAM tests come up clean. System BIOS is from 2018. Is this a case of bad RAM or can I do something before travelling to service the server?

 I&#x27;m not in the team that supports AD, but on hearing that my Spidey sense went off that it&#x27;s a sign things have gone horribly wrong.
 But the team that supports AD claims they only follow best practices. I&#x27;m looking for anything that indicates a best practice or expected user to group ratio, so I can document the issues, to get some cleanup started.

                              <span>So, there are lots of good blocklists available. But 1 thing is kinda worrying, is the absence of ipv6 addresses. If I enable ipv6 on the router, almost 90% of the traffic is ipv6.
 Do bad actors only use ipv4?
 Is this a reason to not enable ipv6? How are most of you handeling ipv6 security?

                              <span>As the title says. You can&#x27;t fleece or finesse your way getting local, high-skilled techs to do your work for you, run your business, onboard clients and expect to streamline your work in a matter of a few years, while sitting back drinking, snorting powder, or whatever pipe dreams you have. It may work for a little while, but you will eventually end up with employees, and clients alike, who will devalue your business to its demise. 
 Where I&#x27;m from there&#x27;s a toxic culture of this at the moment. Just because you started your IT career in 08 doesn&#x27;t quantify your business for 15 years in service with a solid client base, when you decided to break off in 2018 and &quot;be your own boss&quot;.
 Now, this is mainly for prospective employees looking to get into the MSP realm, fresh out of college, first IT jobs. Be very, very careful when applying and accepting positions for MSP&#x27;s. Do your research, look up the directors and consultants and their history. If you don&#x27;t, you will burn your resume with short stints at these failed businesses, who fight over breadcrumb clients with their empty promises of a seamless silver service. 
 Always ratio the business in terms of current techs to managed clients before accepting a position - at the moment a safe zone and job security is 1:50, and may even move more towards 1:75 1:100 as more businesses go cloud. Anything less and you are only going to fill a void for 6-12 months and end up in the endless cycle of last in first out, as business goes through peaks and troughs at certain times of the year. 
 This is not speculation, it&#x27;s a reality.

                              <span>Hi guys,since the rpi4 prices are going down, and for whatever reason i have the urge to build a cluster...redundancy is a big goal of mine, im wondering if network booting via a NAS server is a good way doing so (instead of booting via SD Card). or is there another hardware/software solution for having network drives for running an OS?
 i would be happy if you guys can give me hints for what i have to look for.
 info:price range is between 500-700$ without the Pis.the cluster would be out of 5-10Pis each should have about 100gb storage.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1042lkf/outlook\_new\_roaming\_signatures\_and\_stationery/
 I&#x27;m having a problem where the roaming signatures in Outlook are happening for users on a RDS server. I have tried to make the registry work, but unfortunately this is not a solution. Has anyone been able to stop this function from appearing on a RDS server?

 I have a SQL 2012 server that I&#x27;m trying to get to send emails via SMTP 365 but I only seem to get errors of &quot;Activation failure.&quot; 
 SQL is also showing the mail queue type as INACTIVE
 Im pretty sure that is the issue but it also seems odd that there is no ID, just NULLs in the next 3 coloums 
 any ideas?

 What is the difference between them?
 How do I deploy Ipsec in transport mode (AH)?

                              <span>I am at my lowest with job seeking for 4 months, last time I bas baited by recruiters and teamlead of a company that they would like to see me in interview for aws cloud engineer..wondering where they got that as I had only onprem experience in my cv and no cloud experience, however that is my dream job so naturally I agreed, 1st round went smooth assuring me that manager wanted to see me despite my hands-on aws experience, I hyped up, started learning aws fundamentals at least for aws and after 2 days on 2nd round I got rejected in 5 min as they are looking for big d*ck kubernetes and containerization guy..feeling like shit after 6th interview (network security) which didn&#x27;t go well, fucked up market, a lot of positions seeking savior to their tech debt from bad management decisions..I dont want to do that and be stuck again for 5 years without cloud experience..
 I think I finally made peace with leaving my network security experience and go into cloud studies in my free time. Market is shit and they never look for junior, also cost of living is catching up with me and money for such lower position are not there..
 Still, Id need advice on which cloud to choose for chance of prospecting position in EU. I know AWS dominated in USA - anybody has an idea what is more dominant in EU? AWS or AZURE? No idea if my firewall engineer experience accounts to something here, but I guess I stopped caring at this point.
 Also, are there security related positions not requiring me to be semi-skilled developer in cloud? Which certs to focus on?

I have recently purchased Yubico and want to use this instead of my phone as i login very often to authenticate. I tried enrolling Yubico for a new rdp client and it failed. I am on the free plan. Do i need a subscription to use Yubico on Duo for MFA to use rdp

                              <span>Hi,
 in my company there are developers (4-5) that use a Device Mac OS as a build machine to push to Azure DevOps. The problem is that they use a service account on the Mac OS. 
 The best practice is to use nominal account for users on that device and then logon/logoff for every user, while software runs in background.
 Do you ever encounter this problem?

                              <span>Ideally looking at companies with 10k+ devices/employees.
 We currently do a gold image for specified models of devices. We have quite a lot of strict security guidelines for what we can and can&#x27;t use. It&#x27;s a time consuming process doing a task sequence in MECM, manually doing drivers and BIOS updates and configuring it for lots of different branding packs, languages etc. Windows updates take a long time to deploy and manage. We&#x27;re almost entirely on prem but moving services to the cloud slowly.
 I&#x27;m looking at making it more flexible. Anything is on the table, cost aside.
 Management hear about autopilot and cloud and think it&#x27;s great. Is it? Is it possible at this scale?
 The &quot;ideal&quot; world is: as many people on cloud as we can. Onboarding is streamlined, models / vendor are mostly agnostic. Open up a ton more options for device models etc. Drivers and things are managed much easier, allowed straight out to the internet and updated as needed.
 Again cost is not an issue.
 Only issues: require lots of compliancy. Lots of standard software, endpoint management etc. Lots of office based and remote workers.
 What are you guys doing? What would you like to do? What would you do with infinite budget?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 Recently created a new Windows 2022 Standard virtual server using VMWARE esxi, however it appears to randomly go into an &quot;unresponsive&quot; state. I&#x27;m unable to ping the device, RDP, access it from the VMware web console and I&#x27;m unable to power off the VM.
 After about 5-10 minutes it will randomly be responsive again and I&#x27;m able to force shut it down/power it back on. There&#x27;s nothing in the windows event viewer logs so I&#x27;m unsure if its a Windows issue or VM. Any ideas?

The company I applied to is gonna give me an extra 20k(putting me into the 6 figure range) and I would have the title of Technical Advisor/Support Engineer. The kicker is that the new position only has 15 days of PTO and I would have a ton of added stress and be responsible for anything that goes wrong while having to brief our military counterparts. Would you stay or take the promotion?

                              <span>Hey there! Just wanted to share a bit about my background. I joined my company as a network engineer about 3 months ago, bringing along my CCNP certification and previous experience in Cisco networking. Although I have some familiarity with basic Linux commands, my main expertise lies in the networking side of IT.
 Now, here&#x27;s where things get interesting. The senior system administrator recently left the company, leaving me in charge of managing all the systems and servers. To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed and lacking in confidence. The senior guy still tries to help me out when he can, but he&#x27;s got his own projects keeping him busy.
 The senior IT guy at our company has over 20 years of experience, and he&#x27;s incredibly knowledgeable. He seems to have a natural understanding of all aspects of systems and developments. Technical stuff comes easily to him, so he never really felt the need to document everything. Before he left, he did his best to teach me, but I must admit it wasn&#x27;t enough for me. I&#x27;m not placing any blame on him, though. In fact, I really liked working with him and learned a lot. I&#x27;m simply sharing my current situation and the challenges I&#x27;m facing in my role.
 Let me give you an idea of what I&#x27;m dealing with. I&#x27;ve got my hands full with various VMs, including a Perforce server, TrueNAS, Active Directory, PFSense firewall, NextCloud, and several customer server VMs. The thing is, I&#x27;m fairly new to VMware systems, Linux, NAS, and PFSense. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the company is planning to hire a senior IT person anytime soon, so it looks like I&#x27;ll be flying solo in the IT department for a while.
 I know I need to upskill and expand my knowledge, but any advice or tips you have for someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Do you all have any luck using AlienVault Open Threat Exchange? I have done some research into open/crowd sourced and cheaper TIL platforms and this one stuck. I am having some issues with it that looks to be on their end. If there are better affordable options I would love to hear something for the sole purpose of researching IOCs and submitting file and url samples.
 My issue upon attempting to Submit a Sample is I get greeted with this message:
 &quot;Submissions
 Invalid &#x27;sort&#x27; parameter &#x27;-addDate&#x27;. Allowed values: add_date, complete_date, description, type, tlp
 You do not have any submissions.&quot;
 ​
 This is even after I submit a domain, but I am unable to submit file samples it appears.
 ​
 Not sure if this is an error on my end or theirs. I utilize open source intelligent information for cyber security research and testing and was attempting to use the AlienVault OTX platform but it seems I am unable to take advantage of their sample submission.

                              <span>I started a Network Engineering role back in November 2022. I like the job but today I was told about another job as a Senior Network Engineer at an MSP for about 20K more. 
 I was always taught that you stay with your company and show loyalty, but later in life I had a Network Engineer tell me that people always bounce around in IT careers. 
 The company I work for now is a family-owned company where people stay for many years if not their whole career (Non-IT). I like what I do and it is easy. Not really challenging I just don&#x27;t know if I should take the advice of moving around. I have never worked for an MSP. I am wondering if I should just stick it out or take the money. 
 I feel like if I leave the company I am with now that I will burn a bridge that I cannot come back to. 
 I guess the question is how long do you all stay at a job before taking another?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pro-AV integrator and I&#x27;m looking for the various options for copper 10G switches with 25G or better SFP uplink ports. We primarily use Netgear M4300 and M4250 lineup, but we&#x27;re up against stock and lead time issues. 
 Wyrestorm NHD600 Series video endpoints require 10G. They have certified the FS S5860-24XB-U with their product so I&#x27;m not worried about it working, and I can get around any switch GUI or CLI... but I&#x27;m more interested in the stuff that isn&#x27;t on the datasheet. Failures? Support? This only has a 4 year warranty (whereas Netgear is lifetime). 
 I know many here (and myself included) use FS for transceivers, cables, and other fiber products... but I&#x27;m a bit on edge about electronics.

                              <span>Hi /r/networking,
 Unfortunately we plugged some standard singlemode fiber cables with LC/PC connectors into fixed LC/APC sockets. We got a link and didn&#x27;t notice or care for a while but now we noticed (mysteriously) reduced performance. We want to replace the cables to fix this, replacing the sockets would be much more difficult. Does anyone have experience with this situation? Some googling just tells me that this might damage the connectors, but I am not sure how likely this is. Would we clearly see damage with an optical microscope?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I have a few HP ProCurve 2610-24/12PWR switches that I can only access via Telnet. I&#x27;m trying to get them on to the latest firmware that I found (R.11.123). I downloaded this firmware and placed it in a folder that is being shared over the network, with security and share permissions set to allow Everyone full control.
 ​
 I downloaded and installed Solarwinds TFTP Server and it is currently running. I changed the root folder to be the local path of where this file is located (C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Files). Solarwinds is set to permit send and receive from all IPs. No other changes were done.
 ​
 I Telnet to the switches and run the command: copy tftp flash IP R11123.swi secondary -- For IP, I have the IP of the Windows server where Solarwinds is installed and the file resides. I have copied and pasted the file name but have also tried typing it out by hand but I keep getting: 00000K Transport error. I can&#x27;t find the page now, but I saw an HP page that said it&#x27;s either permissions, file name, or the file doesn&#x27;t exist in the location.
 ​
 What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out for 2 days trying to figure this out.

                              <span>Hey ALL,
 I am looking to upgrade our switch to take advantage of faster available port speeds.
 This is our current model:
 HP 2620-48 J9627A
 https://www.newegg.com/p/0XP-002G-00188 
 We need about the same number of ports as well as at least 1gig ports all the way around.
 I found a couple of options:
 https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/aruba-instant-on-1930-48g-4sfp-sfp-switch#techSpecs
 https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/48-port-netgear-gs752tp-v2-switch-l3-smart-48-x-10-100-1000-poe-4-x-...
 Any other suggestions would be much appreciated. We have a basic network so dont need advanced features. Just need enough POE to power our ip phones and the ability to take advantage of 1gig internet speeds.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I am running PoE to an outdoor (non-PoE) access point with a 48 to 12V PoE splitter. Right next to it, I require a 5V line for a non-PoE wifi camera. It would be great if I did not have to run separate 5V USB power for the cam, using a 48 to 5V PoE splitter. Cam cannot use Ethernet. I am wondering if I can do it this way. Will the straight-thru RJ45 splitter carry the power on the same pins? Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi,
 Working on an issue that is causing me a lot of stress. 
 There are many sites that have been cut over to a new internet circuit successfully. A simple swap of cables and minor adjustments, and they&#x27;re off to the races. 
 There&#x27;s one site that just won&#x27;t cooperate. 
 We cut over the site, and SLA monitors show 50%+ packet loss. Link itself has been end-to-end RFC2544 tested by the SP with no apparent issues. 
 What&#x27;s more, a backup link that goes entirely unused once the cutover is complete and testing is performed shows the same high levels of packet loss. This occurs only when traffic is pushed over the link; on idle packet loss is 0% across the board. The same behavior can be observed for latency and jitter. 
 The existing link is unaffected. Regardless of a lower available bandwidth, it is largely stable. The backup link, if utilized when the original link is in place proves to be of a lower than expected quality when utilized, but it is wireless so there may be more elements causing that. 
 The behavior of all monitored connections, including the unused backup link showing high packet loss when migrated to the new link is puzzling. I can only imagine that it would be down to electrical interference or poor grounding quality as I have tested all other elements isolated from one another to ensure it wasn&#x27;t caused by the site equipment. Some hardware replacements or failovers have been made to no avail. 
 The routing, switching, and new circuit are all in the same rack. The existing circuit is wall mounted in the same room. The backup link modem is in another room, but is connected by a single cable back to the rack and is otherwise not grounded. 
 Would this be a reasonable element to look in to in order to troubleshoot the issue?

                              <span>Hello I have the following setup.
 We are a small company who sells software to hospitals.
 The software is a web application wich is hosted at the costumers network.
 To do maintanance and updates we need access. 
 So we have our company network (192.172.180.0/24) (f.e. just with 3 laptops),
 And a second subnet (network on the left .183.0/24).
 The networks are connected by a sophos hardware firewall.
 on the .183 there are many site to site tunnels configured to the coustumers network.
 So always one site the .183.0/24 and the other site the coustumers network. 
 So to Acess the costumers network we have to connect from the .180 company network to the .183 network to a windows vm with RDP. Than we are on the network wich has the site to site tunnels. 
 My question , can you call that a dmz ?

                              <span>I have a Netgear GS728TPPv2 that I added to the Insight Cloud Portal. We are currently building a new network in our building while keeping the old network setup active. I put the ISP line into a dummy switch that had a line going to the old network setup to keep the building tenants live and a line to the new setup so I can work on configuring the new network switches. I was working on adding vlans to the ports so that some only had the external traffic straight from the ISP and some ports only had network traffic for an internal trusted network that comes from a watchguard firewall. Everything was working great until I made port 1 (where the isp comes into the switch) a tagged port with the external vlan (999) and management vlan (1). The moment I did that, the switch lost connection to the cloud AND it &quot;broke&quot; the internet for all tenants on the old network set up. See the attached network diagram for more details. Now I wiped the GS728TPPv2 and removed it from the cloud. Even from factory default settings, the moment I connect the GS728TPPv2 to the dummy switch, it breaks the internet for the users on the old network. How do I fix this loop/routing issue?

                              <span>So in a TCP connection, if a port is closed and recieves a SYN packet, it sends back an RST packet (if I&#x27;m right). I want to do some changes to my Ubuntu so when a client sends a SYN packet to a closed port, the port stays idle and does not send anything so the attacker cannot do port scanning based on the response. How to do so?

Do they even exist? I looked for cisco or Palo Alto Network events found nothing. I wanted to attended one of these events for fun.

                              <span>I know you can get breakout cables to turn a 40Gb port into 4 x 10Gb ports via a breakout cable. I&#x27;ve never used one myself but I&#x27;ve seen they are available. 
 Is there such a think however as turning a 40g/100G port into 4 x 10g ports that you can plug a SFP cable into? 
 So rather than a male connector it would be female I guess? 
 Does that make sense? so instead of a 40Gb SFP port I now have 4 x 10Gb ports? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, looking into VMware SD-WAN (Formerly or still Velocloud?) and got a few questions. For our business, it seems great so far given it can do per-packet flow over multiple connections rather than per-session flow so that we can aggregate multiple connection together for a single client. Being able to have a routed subnet is crucial for us given we host a few email servers, file servers, and websites out of our office. So, if we grab two velocloud devices and place one in our colo in the data center, and one here at our head office, are we able to propagate an IP block we get from the data center over the velocloud to use for our core router at the office? We have VPN connections, and lots of different configurations I&#x27;d rather not have to change and would prefer if we could use the velocloud to push us that routed subnet possibly via BGP to our router where it can pick it up. Is this something Velocloud is able to accomplish or no?

                              <span>Wow, after some reading it would seem that I&#x27;m no the only one with a story to tell.
 Have a Dell R730XD, was operating fine for majority of its lifetime.
 Recent times strike and we face issues with the server erroring and shutting off, requiring a power drain and manual power on.
 Reached out to Dell support on the 15/05/2023 to advise of the issues and to share the iDRAC logs.
 Dell support request diagnostics of disconnecting the BPs to see if the issue goes away, given it was an intermittent issue it came and went, however they attempted to mark it as a resolved case.
 Couple of days later and the issue becomes worse and now Is happening non stop, server is barley able to function given it keeps forceful shutdowns on itself.
 Dell still reluctant to send replacement parts continue to …</span>

                              <span>Okay, so here it goes. I work for an MSP where it&#x27;s a very small number of people (30, whole company) supporting literally thousands of pcs and servers as we have a fair number of clients. We are constantly swamped, under pressure, behind, but they don&#x27;t want to pay another person. On top of all of this, there are serious communication issues.
 This is my first experience with an MSP so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s normal and what isn&#x27;t, but 1 am being paid 35,000 a year for this and I&#x27;m about done. I took the crap salary for the experience and l&#x27;ve gained serious experience with Exchange, 365, ADs, firewall policies, dhcp, etcetera so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.
 My issue is : I&#x27;m ready to take the experience learned and jump ship, but I&#x27;m scared that maybe it&#x27;s just this rubbish everywhere. Is this normal? What&#x27;s a normal workload? I have only had a couple years of work in IT before this. Is this just the world of sysadmin, network engineer in general? Hit me with your stories and experiences

                              <span>Anyone else screwed over by this? I just found out because CloudFlare sent me an email warning me about the massive change. Seems like Google kills everything that is good.
 Personally, I would like to just transfer all of my domains to Cloudflare&#x27;s registrar and keep all renewals managed in the same place, problem is they don&#x27;t take the newer TLDs like .dev.
 Anyone have any suggestions on registrars that are friendly to use when you manage tons of domains? 
 Also need advice on downtime, I have never actually transferred domains from Google before. Ideally I would want to be able to make sure that the Authoritative NS are set to Cloudflare on the new registrar side before transfer so that there is no DNS issues and down time, and no recreating a bajillion DNS records.
 I do not pay for Cloudflare either, just using free tier and most domains don&#x27;t even need any proxying. If there is a registrar that makes it easy to import DNS records from Cloudflare, that might be a good option as well.

                              <span>For example, in your day to day roles. How many of you still end up as the T3 or escalation point for help desk, and how many are 100% on infrastructure/networks/applications/etc. 
 Idk why, but it grinds my gears when I&#x27;m trying to focus on something and I get the dumbest escalations from helpdesk, I just facepalm and do basic tasks for them. Either that or ask them what exactly they&#x27;ve done and where they&#x27;re stuck and why it&#x27;s being escalated at all. Even from management on occasion &quot;can you help user with their outlook, x y and z on helpdesk are busy.&quot;
 I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s worth it to pursue a change in my contract to put in a clause where no end user support will be expected of me. What&#x27;s the general vibe on this?

I want to be serious about this technology and want to learn more about it. Where should I start? Is there any good book about WMI? or websites? I noticed that there seems a whole query language in wmi which is kind of intimidating. I&#x27;m very familiar with sql. But I don&#x27;t know where to start and apply my SQL knowledge to help me understand wmi.

                              <span>I posted previously that I am looking for software to monitor and manage some windows based systems. I already know of RMM tools like Kaseya, NinjaOne, etc. The kind of software I was pointed to (Store Gazer) looks to be more like a DEX system like Lakeside, and NexThink. My questions is what are the fundentmental differences between DEX tools like Lakeside and RMM tools like NinjaOne? 
 From what I can tell, they appear to be very similar. DEX is geared more towards letting the end user fix issues while RMM is more for full remote system management. THey each seem to overlap on some things. I mostly need a system to monitor system resources and try to notice a failure before it hits (like a failing HD). 
 I was hoping someone has had experience with them both and can pinpoint a clearer use case difference.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m changing my company&#x27;s ISP from Windstream (T1 lol) to AT&amp;T gig fiber. We will have an SD-WAN but they are coming to install that later so I don&#x27;t have to worry about that. Spectrum will be used as a backup circuit for the SD-WAN.
 I have never switched ISPs for a company before. We have one static IP we utilize. We use a VMware Windows 2012 r2 server for everything as this is a small family business. 
 Am I correct in assuming all I need to do to change us over, is change the IP information in Server Manager/DNS manager and plug the new router in to the switch rack?
 Sorry if this is a dumb one, but I&#x27;m still learning and I want to do a good job here.
 Thank you so much in advance to anyone who takes the time out of their day to help! I really appreciate this community.

 Below are a few major use cases of this script.
  
Get inactive user reports based on inactive days (e.g., inactive users for 90 days)
 Find inactive users based on non-interactive sign-in days
 Check inactive external users
 Get a list of inactive users with licenses assigned
 View the last login date for sign-in-enabled users
 Identify never logged in users in Microsoft 365

 My supervisor left and i&#x27;ve been given command. I was about to given &quot;Sr. Network &amp; Systems Admin&quot;, but with his departure i can take on the title &#x27;VP of IT&quot;. 
 I&#x27;m a very technical person, i love getting dirty in the nitty gritty and working on stuff. If i take this new title of &quot;VP of IT&quot; and want to move on to other technical roles else where, would this title scare potential employers away? With them thinking i&#x27;m either just a manager or they dont want a former head of IT working as some System admin? I want to eventually evolve my career away from networking admin and focus solely on System admin and security.

 They removed the license from the account on the 18th. 
 We added it back on the morning of the 19th. However, there aren&#x27;t any login logs before the 18th. Looked in AAD user logs and compliance &gt; audit. 
 What are reasons it wouldn&#x27;t go back before the 18th? If they can be cleared, is there a log kept of it being cleared? I&#x27;ve never had this happen before

                              <span>my understanding is this folder is system based and important for updates.
 sentinelone is constantly flagging files with no real virus mentioned. seems the AI picks up things like OS ENTRY records and Modifies system files as the flags... 
 Is whitelisting for exclusion the CONFIG.MSI folder a good idea.. seems like a good place for virus and root kits to be injected.. that would be where they may try.
 re: \Device\HarddiskVolume3\Config.Msi\3f6ddf.rbf
 thoughts?

My understanding is I shouldn&#x27;t deploy the old LAPS client to them but should I be doing anything else? Everything I&#x27;ve read has been about 2019/22. They&#x27;ve got the old LAPS group policy applied to them but it doesn&#x27;t look like the password is getting updated.

                              <span>Over the past week or so, I have had users of Chrome and Firefox report web slowness. The same users do not report slowness using Edge. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? I’ve cleared data in all browsers on affected PCs with no change. All affected PCs are Win 11 Enterprise.

                              <span>Hello! We are currently working on finishing up our migration to 365 and working to move printers and internal apps to not use our internal exchange server for SMTP. My boss is a bit worried about direct send/authenticated SMTP to 365 as he has concerns over publishing all remote office IPs within the SPF record (as well as other concerns). I understand the concerns, but feel it may not be fully warranted.
 I was wondering if anyone has deployed an internal SMTP relay that is not an exchange server or any other suggestions to not require publishing all remote office public IPs via the SPF. TIA!

                              <span>I am having an issue in one of our meeting rooms where when a user first logs in, launches Outlook 2016 and tries to join a teams meeting from Outlook (both through the add on for teams in outlook and by clicking the link, going to browser and clicking open app) that the teams app doesn&#x27;t open in the first few minutes. If I wait around 3-5 minutes and then try the add on or via the link they both work just fine.
 Teams also starts when a user logs on, normally ready within the first 20 seconds of being logged in and is definitely running by the time the users try to access the meeting.
 I have made sure the browser, teams and Outlook are all up to date but still have this issue.
 I can only assume that there is something Teams needs to be running before it has this function and it takes around 3-5 minutes for this to run. Does anyone have a fix/work-a-round for this or encountered the same issue I&#x27;d love to know.
 Or if anyone knows what it is teams waits for I could even try looking into finding a way to get this running much sooner in the log on processthat&#x27;d be great.
 Any help is much appreciated.

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin!
 I&#x27;m starting a new position at an established company that never really had IT and was wondering if there have been any posts where people share their system management stack? If not, I was hoping I could get some examples of what people use and how happy they are with each tool. I&#x27;ve included a few I have touched in my career but it&#x27;s always nice to hear opinions for different size companies. I&#x27;m hoping to cover:
 System Management/MDM (Intune, Workspace One)
 Collaboration (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace)
 Remote control (Logmein, Splashtop, Connectwise)
 Client VPN (OpenVPN, Zerotier)
 Security Camera System (Verkada, Hikvision (ugh), Truvision)
 Antivirus/EDR (SentinelONE, Microsoft Defender)
 EDR SOC addon (Huntress, SentinelONE Vigilance)
 Networking (Meraki, Aruba, Ubiquiti)
 Meetings (Zoom, Teams, Goto, Google Meet)
 Password Manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass)
 Identity Management (Azure AD, Okta)
 IT Documentation (IT Glue, Hudu)
 Messaging (Teams, Slack)
 Email Security (Mimecast, Proofpoint)
 Vulnerability Scanning (Qualys)
 Voip (RingCentral, Teams, Goto)
 SIEM (Splunk, Solarwinds)
 I probably missed a few things on the list but you get the idea. I have never had quite so many holes to fill before and it&#x27;s exciting to be able to build out the entire environment so it can all work together well.
 Thanks so much for the help and I hope others can find this useful too!

                              <span>As IT workers we are often given “keys to the kingdom” which need to be wielded carefully and with great respect and ethics. We have the power to look into anyone’s emails, files, phone call logs etc but as the meme goes, ain’t nobody got time fo dat. 
 Enter Microsoft Purview. We moved over to Defender about a year ago but never really got around to looking into how deep the rabbit hole truly goes. We’re dipping our toes into DLP and some other compliance measures and holy shit the power of Purview scares the hell out of me. Literally every single thing that anyone does across all devices is right there in a near real time list. Of course Microsoft categories for things are all sorts of fucked up but you don’t even have to look for anything specific for peoples entire work lives to just appear before your eyes. 
 Is this all just too much? I honestly feel conflicted in using this as it feels too intrusive. I’ve been involved in many investigations of employee misuse of resources etc but they have been specifically targeted and all actions audited for that exact purpose and the tools for it were essentially under lock and key. Now with Purview it’s all just…there. It feels wrong to me.

                              <span>Title pretty much. We have a POS (piece of shit) software that has a new version that for some stupid reason suddenly requires Administrative credentials to install even though it install under user context (in user AppData). This obviously renders our management tools (PDQ &amp; Intune) unable to perform the installation.
 The support at the vendor is clueless and doesn&#x27;t seem to understand the issue. Apparently in their mind everyone has administrative access so this should be none issue.
 I&#x27;ve run procmon to try and catch the part that triggers the UAC prompt but I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to look for. I believe it is trying to access/write something to the HKLM hive or class root hive.
 Any tips or links to guides would be greatly appreciated at this point.
 Edit: the new version does not have &quot;UAC Compliant&quot; checked when I viewed it in Orca. Any idea if that&#x27;s the root cause here?

 Due to the increasing popularity and widespread usage of ChatGPT or any AI in general, I wanted to explore how AI can enhance the day-to-day activities of sysadmins, enabling them to be more productive and efficient in their roles. I would greatly appreciate it if you could share how you are leveraging AI in your work and the specific purposes it serves.

 I know what is ATA, ATA Architecture, ATA gateway, ATA center and all. But, I am not sure what is the function of ATAGatewayUpdater service ?
 BinaryPathName: &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics\Gateway\Microsoft.Tri.Gateway.Updater.exe&quot;
 I searched in google but there are no relevant information about this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a kinda new sysadmin and a user asked if it would be possible to optimise this process:
 He works on department A and creates documentation in this structure:
 \server\department_a\projectx\documentation
 every time he creates documentation there he has to manually copy and paste it to:
 \server\department_b\project_x\documentation
 so the people from department B can get the documentation to send to the clients.
 Is there any way to make it so every time he creates a file on &quot;\server\department_a\projectx\documentation&quot; it is automatically copied to &quot;\server\department_b\project_x\documentation&quot;?
 I&#x27;ve tried making a softlink with mklink command, but it seems that it doesn&#x27;t work on shared folders. Another option that comes to my mind is to create a batch that automatically checks whether a new file is created on said folders and if so it copies it to the other one, but I would like to know if there&#x27;s any other option that I haven&#x27;t thought of.

 I&#x27;m in a small company with 10-15 folks and each of us wears many hats, and we just hired a new HR manager person.
 What roles would be best to give to this person? I&#x27;m talking about Azure Roles—or other rights or tools to help this person out.
 We are using Azure in the cloud, so there is no on-premise.
 Thank you for the help!

                              <span>Hi all
 Currently working on a project to replace our Dell NX3230 (W2K12 R2 Storage Server). We have had a quote back from Dell and I notice that they are only offering Windows Storage Server 2016 which goes end of life in less than 4 years.
 Obviously, I want to get the best life out of this hardware as we are a small business, but I am now worried that I won&#x27;t even be able to get 5 years out of this bit of kit before EOL.
 It looks to me that I might have to bite the bullet and buy a full Windows Server license for this device so I can run Server 2022, but judging by the Dell downloads page, its unclear if this would even be a supported OS for this hardware.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on this or alternatives I can look at?
 TIA

 Do they simply get IT equipment replaced - no questions asked- when they report their laptop, headset etc lost or missing?

 Sysmon64.exe -c sysmonconfig.xml
 After executing the command, we received the following output:

 Configuration updated.
 ​
 Despite the successful update, upon checking the configuration, we discovered that it was not being read, and only the default values were being installed. We have attempted various XML files, but since ours have not been changed for some time, the problem persists. We even created a new configuration file with a few rules, but encountered the same issue. Additionally, we tried downgrading to the previous version, but the problem remains unresolved.
 If anyone has any insights or ideas on how to resolve this issue, we would greatly appreciate your assistance.

 Our client is using M365 Business Premium licenses, which do not include CALs. Is it necessary to order Windows Server CALs in order to access on-premise application servers, and if so, under what circumstances?
 Thank you for your assistance.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m looking for a second job. I&#x27;m in a bad financial state, but my current job is low impact that I have a LOT of time to fill during the day.
 So I got pinged by First Cloud Inc. and things sounded very promising. I just got an offer letter today and I signed thinking I&#x27;m getting gainful employment.
 Then I get a text message this evening saying the following https://i.imgur.com/ZJ5X7E0.png
 Immediately all sorts of warning bells start going off. Is this normal? This doesn&#x27;t feel normal. I&#x27;m supposed to get hardware sent to me tomorrow and I start the 22nd.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been tasked to revamp my wife&#x27;s business IT infrastructure. She has 7 staff, each with somewhat old computers. She wants to upgrade most of them and try to reuse any useful parts from the old ones.
 In the past, she has had issues around user security and people messing up the devices. First thing I&#x27;m wondering is what&#x27;s the go-to solution for desktop device management in small business offices where everyone is using Windows.
 Second, I&#x27;m thinking whether it would be a wise move to buy 1 or 2 excellent servers and just give everyone a Windows VM running in the server that they can connect to via a thin-client from their desks. Does this type of solution work well, or is it better to just give everyone a good dedicated machine running Windows for them to use?
 Thanks

 First of all before I go in what I need I just want to say I am only a couple of hours of research in, my understanding of things like DSC and infrastructure as code is limited and this is why I am here, so hopefully I can get someone with more experience to give me their opinion on where I should head.
 The gist is that I need to automate environment creation whilst working working with Hyper-V.
 Everything from VM creation, OS installation, integration with AD, setting up of features like SQL Always On and IIS load balancing, I need to be automated with very little interaction, I am going to be deploying hundreds of servers and want to make it reliable and repeatable as possible.
 So my real question is, should I expect this to be easily feasible to implement, if so how do you do it? and do you have any resources you could share like git projects. 
 Many thanks in advance!

 Getting on with it...
 February 2023
 Since I got radio silence from the fiber planning department and the ISP, I decided to call both of them once again, and got the same response: &quot;It&#x27;s done when it&#x27;s done, we&#x27;ll notify you.&quot;
 March 2023
 Middle of march, a parcel arrives at our location. It&#x27;s a router. I didn&#x27;t order a router. It also had no information on who sent the parcel. Deep down in the package, there was the packing list: It was actually the ISP which just sent us a new router, probably for the fiber connection. Great! That means it can&#x27;t take long anymore, can it?

                              <span>Good day, I&#x27;m fairly new to the Linux environment and only took a semester of it in college. I&#x27;m attempting to setup a PXE boot server with the latest Ubuntu server release (I think 20.04.6) and after setting up the DHCP role and PXE role and grabbing all the necessary files in all the right directories, my client machine can PXE boot to an extent.
 When I network boot on the client, I get the IP info of the PXE server, then the gateway, and then PXE-E32: TFTP open timeout. This repeats 3 times. I verified my settings 3x, but I&#x27;ve been using ChatGPT as my guide. So something is inevitably messed up. Does anyone have suggestions?

 It all started for me 4 months ago, reading this post right here in /r/sysadmin 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1114113/im_a_sysadmin_im_43_and_ive_just_been_diagnosed/
 I read through the post and the comments and found myself relating to almost everyone who talked about their ADHD and diagnosis. I had suspected ADHD for probably a decade, but to me ADHD was just the guy who can&#x27;t sit still and is a disruption to everyone around them, which wasn&#x27;t me. But what I didn&#x27;t know was that my ADHD burnout had been slowly boiling and was at a point where I couldn&#x27;t contain it any longer.

 Upon reboot, roughly half the devices blue screened stating that \windows\system32\winload.efi is missing. 
 If I try and load recovery, it says file \BCD is missing. 
 When I launch recovery from a recovery disk, I can see that bitlocker is enabled and the c drive is locked. When I try and unlock it, the password key is not working. 
 Has anyone seen something similar?

 I&#x27;m trying to work on getting AKS stood up with an HA PG SQL database, multiple vnets for multi region redundancy, and various other items. I scheduled 2 weeks of dedicated time, I&#x27;ve spent exactly 4 hours on it in that time due to doing work for everyone else and managements &quot;priority&quot; shit.
 Today was the last straw when I was asked to do something that &quot;you said would take a minute&quot;, for reference I never said that about this, it was something else that I delivered 2 weeks ago. Top it off, since then the guy has permissions to make a service principal now.
 So I told my boss to text me if he needs me and I turned off slack on my phone and computer. I am late by weeks on so many projects because of this. I can&#x27;t be much more late on this since it&#x27;s needed for multiple other initiatives. I&#x27;m not in trouble or anything but I&#x27;m getting people asking &quot;when will this be done&quot; at this point... The answer is never at this rate.

I&#x27;ve been mostly in the mode of learning systems as time presented and training a new Helpdesk staff. Eight months ago, we landed on a good fit for that position. Now for the turn. Every chance he gets, he points out everything that needs to be done, the ways he did it in previous places, and how he can&#x27;t believe things can even be supported not being documented and fully understood.

 I said to him &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just take the handful of files you need, instead of copying everything by default?&quot;
 He goes, &quot;It&#x27;s easier if I just take it all. Then it&#x27;s all there if I ever need anything in future.&quot;
 Makes no sense. These are work files. Why would you randomly need work files or emails in the future?
 Update:
 I just had a chat with him and explained how insane it was. He gets it now.

                              <span>We had a bad storm over the weekend and power is out everywhere. Somehow we got only power on Monday early morning but no internet. Everyone bitching non stop about when is the coming back and trying to use the hot spot which is pretty much killing the LTE/5g connections in the office. They keep grasping at straws trying to find ways to get connected. It&#x27;s 9 am and shit I already need a drink.

                              <span>Curious how teams are doing this today, I know there&#x27;s a variety of options out there that all solve a portion of this pain but wanted to hear from actual orgs in how they may have implemented it or even rolled their own solution.
 Currently my org does this manually at about 40+ people and it&#x27;s pretty painful. We:
 Have a master spreadsheet for all tools
 Owners of these tools are spread across the org mostly with the founders and some founding engineers (trying to transfer ownership to me but with some tools it looks like we need to pay to add more seats)
 Don&#x27;t have a consistent way to manage the security, provisioning and de-provisioning of this today
 We use a Zendesk form in Slack for hiring managers to add tool provisioning requests for their new hires. Same request process for existing employees looking for access to other tools in the org.
 We don&#x27;t have a great way or policy for new tool sign up - I feel like this should go through me but again, very manual
 Curious to hear how you&#x27;re managing this :
  
How big / mature is your org
 What process / tooling do you have in place - what&#x27;s the good/bad/ugly on this
 What role do you play in managing this process
 
 TIA!

                              <span>We currently have a local Active Directory setup for user authentication and would like allow our user to authenticate and log into their computers using their 365 account. We currently have the free version of Azure, which would make hybrid the better option I think since I can still update group policies using the local domain controller.
 My question is, once I setup the Azure AD Connect on the local domain controller, would my users still be able to log into their current AD account to access their windows profiles on their computers? From my understanding, using their 365 to log in will create a new windows profile, which is fine. But I’d still like them to be able to access their windows profile from the local AD account so I have time to migrate settings and data. 
 Thanks

 I am currently in school for a sys admin program and am working on obtaining my Linux+ and eventually Sec+ etc. I wanted to touch upon DevOps however because of the high demand for it but I cannot figure out for the life of me the responsibilities of a DevOps engineer. Does anyone here work in DevOps and can you give me an example of what you do and how you gained your experience / skills.
 Thanks

                              <span>We&#x27;re seeing an issue with Windows Search on Windows 10 21H2. When opening the start menu and searching, the start menu is blank with only dots cycling near the top (like its trying to find something). We&#x27;ve had a case with Microsoft open for months now but they&#x27;re basically useless.
 I believe the root of the issue in that ShellExperienceHost is not running. We&#x27;ve tried re-registering the application on the base image:
 Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &quot;$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&quot;} 
 If I try to start the ShellExperienceHost process manually, we get this error:
 The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application. This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application. 
 In Event Viewer, we see this error:
 Faulting application name: ShellExperienceHost.exe, version 10.0.19041.1949 Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version 10.0.19041.2913 Exception code: 0xc0000409 Faulting application path: C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\ShellExperienceHost.exe Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\KERNELBASE.dll 
 I&#x27;ve tried repairing using SFC/DISM. I can recreate the issue with and without our profile management software. I tried an in-place upgrade from 21H2-&gt;22H2 but that also did not resolve the issue. Anyone seen something similar?

We are installing an access control system on orders of the GM and keep butting heads with maintenance or having to deal with them dragging their feet. They are also muttering about it doing their job and playing blame games when their are project issues. Advice and or other experience to draw on would be appreciated. Most places I work it and facilities had a good if at times teasing relationship. 
 Note Their department includes all the workers for the truck fleet and it consists of two people including me.

                              <span>Our tenant (&lt;50 users) is comprised primarily of Business Standard licenses. While I mostly work in AWS and Heroku, as the person who knows how printers work, i am also sometimes tasked with making changes to our Azure Active Directory account. After a recent scare, the CEO finally has learned the value of MFA. I turned off legacy mfa and enabled the security defaults and i&#x27;m looking into setting up conditional access rules but I need to have a Business Premium license. Do i need this license for all users who are subject to the rules created by a BP licensee account, or is this saying that I have to upgrade all of our BS users to BP in order to be protected by these rules?

                              <span>Greetings all,
 We are looking for a software tool that can help auto-deploy VMs for software testing and validation. This tool should allow us to pick a combination of architectures (ARM, x86, M1/M2, etc) and OSes (Mac, Linux, Windows, etc) to auto-deploy either on a local server or cloud device. Once the deployment is done, we will execute some automation tools to validate a test branch of our software, report some findings, and then terminate the test device. The test VMs won&#x27;t live very long; just long enough to run some test cases and record the output (via shared volume, etc).
 At this point, we are looking at a varity of deploment tools (LXD, Docker, Terraform, etc) but have not landed on one just yet. The important thing is the ability to select from a matrix of architecture and OS selections, click &quot;GO&quot;, and ultimately get access to the test systems.
 Hope this makes sense. Thanks for any pointers.

                              <span>[UK] Been in my current job coming up to 3 years. IT for a firm and we have two more firms in other locations and each location supports each other. There 3 of us in the IT team locally and would say we’ve become friends as well as colleagues. The gig is easy but i don’t feel like i’m challenged I manage the helpdesk and AD, Exchange stuff groups, mailboxes etc and provide regular tech support. 
 Buddy works at a ISP that also provides a Business service side like MSP / Datacenter stuff and mentioned a Network Engineer position coming up. If the pay is better i’d be tempted to go for it but I’d feel bad for leaving the team just cause i know it’ll fuck them up for abit with the work. Has anyone else felt like this before and how you navigated it?
 I could stay but i just feel stuck on helpdesk. The sysadmin above me was doing it for like 6 years before he moved up to more server stuff and projects. But i could only go up if someone comes under me or everyone above moves up 1 position but the company would never hire more people we been struggling to get a third in one location since i joined. 
 I don’t hold any certs but studying Net+ at the moment
 I don’t really care for the end users and rest of the company but the IT teams are really great chill guys to work with. But plugging in keyboards or showing people how to use a web browser earning more than me is abit disheartening haha
 TLDR: Possible chance to make the jump from helpdesk to network engineering, Have you ever found it hard to leave your IT colleagues for a new role.

I’ve changed this value yesterday on prem and force synced azuread connect for 50 users in the tenant. However, many users are reporting they can still logon with old value/upn. I’ve done this before on other tenant they couldn’t logon with old upn within a few hrs. is this a token refresh thing? is there a new feature that allows the use of an old upn? Ive not got access yet as I’m in Poland today and admins are West US and I’m waiting for an admin to give me access to check status.

 Is it possible to create a home_folder for a user without the requirement to use and assign a drive letter?
 I want to assign a home_folder to a dfs resource. Everything works ok, but I don&#x27;t need a home_folder that is connected also to a other drive letter. DFS has own drive letter.
 It&#x27;s option to create home_folder on Active Direcory Users and Computer -&gt;User Properities-&gt;Profile-&gt;Home folder-&gt;Connect &quot;I don&#x27;t want to assign letter &quot; -&gt;To: \\company.local\share\home\user (DFS Namespace share)?
 I want share all folders on one share (G). 
 G:\DFS\PUBLIC
 G:\DFS\HOME_FOLDER
 G:\DFS\COMPANY
 I don&#x27;t want H:\HOME_FOLDER

                              <span>Hi,
 Something has changed where before we were able to log into a Tap scheduler with an MTR account (pro licence) without any issues. 
 Now we try to log in, it seems the device wants to enroll to Intune. Is there an easy way in which to bypass this? Is this a config on the Tap scheduler itself or Company Portal/Intune settings that is catching the device logging in and enforcing enrollment?
 error we&#x27;re getting is &quot;Signing out.. This device isn&#x27;t enrolled in Device Administrator. Contact your Admin&quot;. (I am in contact with our admin as well)
 Thanks

 Every once in a while we get system fan errors. The first few times I replaced the fans, but we get so many fan failure errors on these units ,that it&#x27;s come to the point where it doesn&#x27;t make any sense. They seem to spin fine.. No real indications of problems either. No overheating, workstations are cooled using an AC.
 Has anyone seen this before? Dell of course isn&#x27;t any help in this case..

 ​
 Given all the issues Microsoft are having recently how is everyone communicating this to users?
 ​
 I was thinking about having a similar internal health dashboard (not just specific to microsoft) for any issues that might come up, and encourage users to check here, not sure where to start! Any software recommendations?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 Has anyone ever considered creating personas for different types of users to enable automation?
 i&#x27;m thinking along the lines of: 
 ​
 Technical Development staff - these will have local admin rights, code app installed, member of development distribution list etc
 Backoffice staff - Marketing, Finance etc, these need MS Office installed and certain other groups etc.
 ​
 The end goal is to have each new starter automatically have 80% of what they need by virtue that I already know their persona so can automate their account creation and being added to certain groups to achieve it.
 ​
 Interested to hear if anyone&#x27;s thought of doing similar or even better if it&#x27;s ended up working out.

                              <span>I have 2 racks next to each other, both racks have a local UPS. Servers have 2 PSU, the question is. One PSU should be powered from UPS A and the other from UPS B? 
 Or should one PSU be plugged into the UPS and the other into a wall outlet?

                              <span>Hi! I have a function app for which I configured a DNS in a private DNS zone within my organization, as well as a private endpoint. The function app uses a Premium EP1 plan, and it is a python function. I configured a storage account in the settings, using WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING and AzureWebJobsStorage. Apart from this, I also configured these app settings:
 APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY
 AzureWebJobsDashboard
 FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION
 FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION
 minTlsVersion
 STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME
 TABLE_STORAGE_KEY
 WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET
 WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE
 ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD
 SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT
 When accessing the function app URL I get an application error. My plan was to then use a Github Actions workflow in order to deploy the functions - but the workflow fails, although the publish profile is correct.
 When request Azure resource at ValidateAzureResource, Get Function App Settings : Failed to acquire app settings from https:///api/settings with publish-profileFailed to fetch Kudu App Settings.
 Service Unavailable (CODE: 503)
 Can anyone please help? I am stuck on this for a long time..

 Quick question, is it possible to make 365 use a different url for smtp? So for instance rather than using smtp.office365.com and then the user name and password for the account it&#x27;s smtp.customdomian.com?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 this is just to confirm: the HPE licensing calculator for Microsoft Windows Server suggests that there is always at least one 16-core license pack needed for every physical server (they label this a &quot;base license&quot;). All the other license packs (2-core, 4-core, and 16-core) are labeled &quot;additional license&quot;, which suggests that these cannot be used stand-alone.
 We are thinking about getting 2-core packs only (please do not ask for the reasons, since that is beyond my paygrade).
 Would it be possible to license a server using only 2-core packs? Are there activation keys included in a 2-core pack?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Recently got my hands in a more or less new tape drive : https://buy.hpe.com/us/en/storage/tape-storage/business-class-libraries/storeever-msl-tape-libraries/hpe-storeever-msl-entry-level-tape-automation/p/1011221564
 And have been tasked to make it work by a person who has no idea of how tape drives work . 
 It&#x27;s to attach to a single backup server, no shared infrastructure. So in theory SAS should be the way to go, but the external cards I&#x27;m seeing are much more expensive somehow.
 Usually I would let the vendor sort this out, but that&#x27;s kind of not an option here, so, before I screw up buying the wrong thing, any recommendations? 6GB SAS would be OK, volume isn&#x27;t really huge.

                              <span>My management is blocking my suggestion of the use of Netbox even though my peers feel it would advantageous for us to have. The reason he is blocking it is, 1. It runs on Linux. 2. It is open-source. My management is against the use of Linux in all applications and is also against open-source. He believes Linux opens our environment to more vulnerabilities and potential security risks which I understand is not a fair assessment. He is also against open-source due to lack of official support that we can&#x27;t pay for. He does not like the idea that support comes from blogs, reddit, etc. Frustrating :( 
 ​
 However, currently my team is managing ~100 locations information from over 10-15 different excel spreadsheets. This includes contacts, circuit information, devices, etc. I think we need it but I dont know how to approach it or become a better influencer to encourage the use of it. Any professional help would be good. Thanks

                              <span>I have an environment that uses a combination of a virtual wireless controller and a physical wireless controller. I have 6 ap&#x27;s that were connected to the virtual wireless controller that had a &quot;capwap ap erase all&quot; command run on them. They now will not join the physical 5508 controller or the virtual controller that they were previously connected to. 
 I see the AP mac&#x27;s listed in &quot;show ap join stats summary all&quot; command and if I do &quot;show ap join stats detailed&quot; on the ap mac I see that the physical controller is successfully discovering the device, but it isn&#x27;t going anywhere from there, it never attempts to join because there are no join requests received or denied. 
 SSH appears to be disabled on default and the AP&#x27;s are in locations that are very hard to get to. Any ideas on how to get these things to join up to either of the controllers?

 Can I use 2x ISR 4321 (with 1x NIM-ES2-8 + 1x NIM-ES2-8p poe) instead 2x 3850 switch? I dont need 24 poe ports in each (4x 1830 APs and 12x CAMs). 
 I wont route lans or vlans through those devices.
 Pros, cons? Performance, Noise, power consumption etc

                              <span>My company&#x27;s ISP offers us an ipv6 /56 prefix. We run the fiber directly to our switches and run virtual VyOS firewalls so there is no ISP gear. Now I wonder what options I have for subnetting since I obviously don&#x27;t want to put all of the devices on the WAN side. Still I&#x27;m trying to have redundant firewalls.
 I was thinking I could perhaps select one /64 for WAN and set up both firewalls to send RAs for the same internal /64 subnets and then ask the ISP to tweak timeouts to ensure failover happens without too much delay, like in this example: http://www.bscottrandall.com/9.2.5.html#ra-message-as-substitute-for-fhrp .
 Otherwise I guess I could ask them to route my /56 through e.g. the first IP in the block and then use VRRP on my firewalls. Not sure if they offer dhcpv6 prefix delegation (like you&#x27;d use on a typical home router) and not sure if I even want to use that, since it will limit my options for redundancy. I&#x27;m an ipv6 noob and I feel I&#x27;m maybe missing something obvious.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am a sysadmin for my company whose weakest area is networking so forgive me if I am missing something or if this question is stupid. Our network SME is off this week and I am being asked to look into this issue. 
 All of the wireless devices at a single company location are all of a sudden unable to access our official internal SSID. I checked the event viewer on the RADIUS server and am seeing tons of errors in the Event viewer, more specifically Event 18, &quot;An Access-Request message was received from RADIUS client {server IP} with a Message-Authenticator attribute that is not valid&quot;.
 I did basic troubleshooting such as restarting the NPS service and rebooting the server to no avail. I checked the RADIUS clients and the group configured for this location is showing that it is enabled and that there is a shared secret entered in. I checked our Meraki dashboard and when I looked at the logs for the APs at this location, I see tons of errors with the message &quot;Client failed 802.1X authentication to the RADIUS server. auth_mode&#x3D;&#x27;wpa2-802.1x&#x27; vlan_id&#x3D;&#x27;10&#x27; radius_proto&#x3D;&#x27;ipv4&#x27; radius_ip&#x3D;&#x27;10.11.8.121&#x27; reason&#x3D;&#x27;radius_login_failure&#x27; radio&#x3D;&#x27;1&#x27; vap&#x3D;&#x27;0&#x27; channel&#x3D;&#x27;36&#x27; rssi&#x3D;&#x27;26&#x27; &quot;
 My googling has led me down the path of there being a possible problem with the shared secret and to recreate it. However, I am just looking for some general guidance here and seeking someone to point me in the right direction because I am lost on this issue. 
 Thank you.

                              <span>We have a project where the Vigor 2865 is the router.
 ​
 We have most fixed devices assigned in the router by MAC reservation outside of the DHCP pool.
 We have a few devices that were added and had their MACs added to the IP reservations BUT the IP addresses were IPs that were in the DHCP pool range. 
 Recently we lost communication with a couple of devices and sure enough they were units that had their MACs reserved but their addresses had been occupied by other wifi devices that had joined the network? 
 It was always my understand that if an IP is reserved/assigned to a MAC, then this IP address is specifically for that device? Is this only the case if the IP address is outside of the DHCP pool? If the reserved IP is IN the pool, can any other networked device occupy that IP instead if the reserved device is offline? 
 Sorry if this is a very silly question!

 It&#x27;s been spotted that since our new WAN provider has been installed, traffic between DCs isn&#x27;t favouring the etherflow and is traversing the WAN instead.
 Having done some digging I think it&#x27;s because the SD-WAN solution uses a proprietary routing protocol that is being redistributed into BGP on their routers in each DC. The core switches have &quot;redistribute direct&quot; set with a route-map that sets the metric to 70 and 75 so the connected routes get advertised to both the WAN and the other DC.
 I think what&#x27;s happening is, the core DC switches see the route that was injected into BGP at the WAN router as an iBGP route and favours this since the routes over the etherflo…</span>

                              <span>I am testing different network techniques in a lab environment using RFC 2544. Something I can&#x27;t quite explain is the fact, that MPLS Throughput is about 17% less than IP-Routing for smaller frame sizes (see below):
 IP-Routing: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 25 Mbps - 128 bytes 43 Mbps - 256 bytes 83 Mbps - 512 bytes 96 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps
 MPLS: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 21 Mbps - 128 bytes 35 Mbps - 256 bytes 67 Mbps - 512 bytes 95 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps
 The network itself is really simple and consists of 4 Routers in a ring. The tester sends the data to the input router that forwards the packet over one of the two transport routers to the output router and to the tester at the end and back again. The MPLS configuration was done without special stuff using OSPF as IGP and adding &quot;tag-switching ip&quot; to the interfaces.
 Maybe someone can give me a possible explanation
 Edit: Routers are quite old, Cisco 2811 ISR

                              <span>I can&#x27;t decide how much of niche problem this is, but either a failure on my Google-fu or it&#x27;s very niche. 
 I&#x27;m usually working solo on a remote site with few other people around, so when we have issues with a multicore fibre - usually someone has damaged the cable or mice have broken pigtails - I connect my fibre torch to one end and walk over to the other side to check for the light before repeating until I find a working pair. 
 Is there a device, which could simultaneously test up to an 8 core cable? Visual only for fault finding, anything more specific and we&#x27;d use a contractor.

                              <span>I’m going to be segmenting our flat corporate network and could use some advice. Currently both servers and clients are all on the same network and we just rely on host based firewalls on the servers to protect everything. I’m going to set up separate VLANs for servers, printers, IoT stuff, and client machines, and then route them through our firewall with the appropriate rules. 
 How can I determine what kind of overhead this is going to require from our firewalls? I’m concerned our hardware firewalls may not be able to process the amount of traffic going through it. They currently only process traffic in and out to the internet.

 Long time lurker, but first time to post here :)
 I have a university project where I need to compare, contrast and maybe make improvements in regard to different FHRP protocols like HSRP, VRRP (v2 and maybe v3?) and GLBP from Cisco.
 For this purpose I have bought subscription to Cisco CML Personal license to be able to simulate the environment as I do not have Cisco gear at my home lab. Of the hardware devices I have, there are two Dell 7048 switches, one Brocade 7450-48 and one Dell Force10 S60 switch.
 Of these switches I have not yet had time to start up and configure Brocade switch as I need special console cable. If somebody can recommend a way to use physical servers to maybe set up a real environment where a couple of VM&#x27;s could be conn…</span>

                              <span>A little background. 
 I&#x27;m a consultant, getting placed with different clients every 6 months or so.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that over the last year and a half, I keep getting placed in companies that want to call all their network engineers &quot;DevOps&quot; engineers, and end up being put on projects that have very little to do with networking. 
 The current one I&#x27;m doing is building a lot of grafana dashboard and using InfluxDB. 
 Whilst I do find this fun in my spare time on my home lab, I&#x27;m not a DBA or a software engineer, and I&#x27;ve really been struggling with doing this work professionally. 
 I feel like every role I am straying further and further from actually being a network engineer, and I&#x27;m forgetting things. I&#x27;ve been trying to recertify my CCNP and really struggling, because I&#x27;m just not using any of the knowledge. 
 Has anyone else had similar experiences in their roles?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on setting up our new office routers, we already have 2 ISP connections going into our single router. However since we are now upgrading to 2 new routers (Mikrotik CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS) HA is crucial. 
 For setting up HA I thought VRRP looks good, however at this stage I&#x27;m a bit confused. Can I just set the ISP static IPs on 2 different interfaces on each router, then setup a simple VRRP and it will automatically handle this? Even if the slave router is inactive could it still not cause issues to use the same public IP as the other router in terms of routing tables at ISP level for example?
 I also see that VRRP supports LB which is also interesting. If anyone got any advice to clear up my confusion please let me know, thank you!

                              <span>Hey there, I&#x27;m facing network issues that affect hosts, that connect to the network, for some minutes.
 As soon as a host gets a connection to the network it starts sending out massive multicast / IGMP traffic (Membership report / Leave group 224.0.0.252). This happens for some seconds or even hours until it stops. During all the time the host is unable to communicate to the network as most packets get lost and dont even arrrive their destination.
 This doesnt happen when I simply disable multicast on the host, but this can&#x27;t be the solution here.
 The issue was tested with 2 Windows VMs on a Xen Server cluster running on a FlexCenter. It has a trunked connection to the next (Netgear) switch. There are no VLANs. IGMP Snooping is turned of.The issue also exists on physical Windows clients in the network.
 One line from the wireshark report:
 No. Time Source Destination Prot. Lenght Info31134 926.817456 172.20.11.124 224.0.0.22 IGMPv3 60 Membership Report / Leave group 224.0.0.252
 Did anyone see such a behaviour before? What could cause this?

                              <span>Question: all servers on cloud, any reason to co tinje using a firewall like fortigate or sophos or Palo alto on prem for hq and branch offices? How about replacing the traditional firewall appliances with cloudflare? 
 Our environment: all windows based PCs/laptops with office365 for email and office apps.
 All applications are on the cloud or will be on the cloud by September. 
 Traditionally, we had all on prem servers for apps, db, telephony and moved to cloud last year. Since the app and db servers were on prem , we had fortigate and sophos Firewalls plus xdr etc 
 Cloud team takes care of cloud security. 
 Want to get rid of sophos and fortigates and all that junk because my clients already have their own av xdr etc installed on their PCs

                              <span>Hello ,
 I am cleaning up my companies Datacenter. We have moved from Physical to Virtual from 80 physical machines down to 12. The 7 new servers use fiber with 5 of the legacy machines using 4 ethernet lines each. Currently there appears to be around 300 ethernet cables running about the datacenter would it be worth removing the majority of them and only leaving about 40 since all the new servers we install run off fiber?
 ​
 I am also tasked with replacing the switching infrastructure in the Datacenter in a year from now and want to do this to help me get an accurate estimate on what costs would be instead of buying an exact match to what we currently have.
 ​
 Thank You,

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 4x Cisco Leaf(Nexus) &gt; DellMx7K with ESXi(Virtual switches and hosts running)
 I&#x27;m having an issue where Virtual hosts look to get dropped after a failover test on the virtual switches. Traffic would come into ACI on different ports. I did create a port-security policy to the interfaces with maxium endpoint value of 0 to disable. As per this document.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/5-x/security/cisco-apic-security-configuration-guide-50x/m\_port\_security.html 
 Server team say it&#x27;s has improved but not fully. Still some hosts disappearing for a short period after failover. Are there any other configurations I need to implement?
 ​
 This link below mentions disabling DTP and using 802.1q over ISL. I can&#x27;t see where to set this is ACI.

                              <span>I am having an issue with wireless clients showing connected, with all the correct DHCP details, but no internet connection
 Current setup:
 Cisco 3750 switch with 2 VLANs.
 VLAN15, &#x27;MGMT-VLAN&#x27;: 10.97.15.1 /24
 VLAN 100, &#x27;Wireless Clients&#x27;: 10.97.100.1 /24
 I have a Draytek Vigor 2960 connected to the switch via trunk port, Draytek is on IP 10.97.15.254 (VLAN 15)
 Cisco 2500 WLC connected to the switch on VLAN 15, IP address 10.97.15.254
 1 x Cisco AP on VLAN 15, IP address: 10.97.15.100
 Draytek FW is issue DHCP to VLAN 100 clients starting 10.97.100.100 - 210
 Interface and SSID setup and presumably working for wireless clients as I can connect to the SSID and pickup an IP, SM,GW and DNS that I specified on the DHCP server (Draytek)
 I can see clients connecting to the AP with the correct network details fro with the WLC, and I can see the same clients connect on the Draytek DHCP table, but my devices, android mobile and MacBook show connected without internet and Im not sure why.
 My devices can ping each over, i.e 10.97.100.100 can ping 10.97.100.101 and vice-versa but they cannot ping the VLAN gateway on 10.97.100.254 even though they are getting their DHCP details from that device.
 Im a bit stuck as to what could be the issue.... any ideas or able to point me in the right direction would be appreciated
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello guys,
 Just need your opinions for those who have worked with out of band access devices as my work require one for lot of equipment such as routers/switches/firewalls in a data center. We are looking for a cheap alternative device that can be used temporarily on each equipment when doing interventions so it may not require many ports since it will be removed afterwards, maybe 4-8 ports. I did my research, mostly found that opengear models are pretty expensive.
 Opengear ACM7004-2 has 4 serial ports RJ-45, 4 USB ports, RS232 compatibility and is relatively small but price around $800. I found several models like these on their websites but with LTE which i don&#x27;t really need. I was searching for cheaper alternatives. For the Opengear IM4208-2-DDC-X2-G, i don&#x27;t have the price but has 8 ports RJ45/RS232, 1 usbport and has some good security features.
 Lantronix SLB console server has 8 ports and seems ideal but couldn&#x27;t find its price and much specs about it, the SLC 8000 has 16 ports but seems pricey on amazon around $2000.
 The perle IOLAN SDG4 has 4 serial ports RJ45, RS232 local console port but cost around $1000. Surely there has to be a cheaper one.
 Digi CM 8 Console Server 8 Port has 8 RJ45/RS232 ports and 1 console port RJ45/RS232, i don&#x27;t have the price for this one but it does feature auth like tacacs and radius.
 So normally a technician would plug in the console server to an existing switch (depending on the brand of the switch, i will have to preconfigure the OOB device to connect to it) and the equipments will be accessible via the switch. Normally most devices in the data center have RJ45 compatibility. What do you guys recommend using for this scenario or if you have used those i have listed or a variation of it ? Btw i&#x27;ve searched most on amazon but there isn&#x27;t much available. Some websites are genuine but don&#x27;t list the prices which makes it harder. Anyway, let me know what you think.
 Thanks in advance.

This Dell Ts340 with the Software Raid Perc 140 has just been repaired with new disk, RAID 10 and OS prepped with drivers. When I get into Windows (after install) and attempt restore, I get an error indicating my partition sizes do not match the restore. I&#x27;m not sure how to figure out exactly which partition or what size is it is having a problem with. (Any advise on how to figure that out would be awesome.)

                              <span>Hi all, hoping to get some of that sweet sweet community wisdom on this before I make the point of no return step of Plugging In A Power Cable. Here, I am the end user who knows enough to be dangerous.
 I have a beloved 4port DVI KVM that has served me for 15y+ and has outlived its own, and a replacement generic power supply. The manufacturer gives the spec as &quot;DC5.3V:5.91W:53BTU&quot;. This means little to me beyond VxA&#x3D;W, therefore 1.11509433962 Amp. I don&#x27;t have a clue what BTU means, I assume it&#x27;s some sort of pre IEEE British Tickling Unit standard for calculating time/distance/nautical speed/psychological moustache impact.
 So armed with this basic knowledge, I conclude I need a 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp DC power supply of +1 good luck finding that on ebay roll a D6 for No.
 However, the long serving recently deceased 5v generic PSU would suggest there are ranges and tolerances to device power distribution. As did a confusing and in hindsight extremely troubling conversation with my teenage era physics teacher which concluded with &quot;meh, over/undervolt by up to 50% you don&#x27;t have to get all precious about it&quot;. 
 &quot;Sir..&quot;, as I was institutionally minded to refer to him as a child of the mid 80s to 90s English school system, &quot;make sense, my autism begs you. It&#x27;s either 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp on your own GCSE final exam paper, or it&#x27;s chaos. Please which is it?&quot;
 So my questions is:
 Given that USB is 5v, and fast charging phone PSUs are not limited to the 500mA standard, and I have worked in IT for over two decades and have never thrown anything away, is there a chance I can MacGyver a solution right now in my home after an entire bottle of wine, or at least for less than a fiver on ebay searching for &quot;USB to DC multi connector cable&quot; ?
 ​
 Thank you all in advance.

                              <span>tldr: Train people \NOT* to keep things they need in the computer trash can!*
 I&#x27;ve been a &#x27;computer guy&#x27; (tech, sysadmin, what-have-you) for many, many years - (started before GUI OS&#x27;s hit the consumer market.)
 Since the advent of the GUI desktop Trash Can, I&#x27;ve developed very strong muscle-memory to empty that dumb thing whenever I see stuff in it - and this has bitten me on the butt more than once.
 Just took a phone call from a friend. I had made a (400-mile) road trip to spend a weekend with him last fall and help him upgrade his old Mac Mini to try and get a few more years out of it.
 &quot;Hey - when you were here, you emptied my trash can - can I get those files back? I was keeping some important photos in there I need back now.&quot;
 Corollary to the rule above; don&#x27;t empty other people&#x27;s trash cans, no matter how much you want to!
 But GEEZ! IT WAS IN THE TRASH!

                              <span>Old angry sysadmin here, figured this is a technology question and it fits this sub, feel free to ban me to ether with the Old Gods, if need be.
 There are obvious negatives to the API costs but I got to thinking...so many annoying things are API generated
  
Annoying bots
 
Mass spam
 
Mass Private Messages from &#x27;ladiez who luv to smooch&#x27;
 
Automated Karma farming accounts
 
 I wouldn&#x27;t be sad to see any of these things go with the &#x27;free&#x27; API moving to a cost-based API. 
 Would these things still exist with the API changes or would it still be relatively cheap? Would pushing API to a cost-based format reduce spam and bots by a large amount?
 Just curious what the other side of the coin is here, if anyone has any ideas or notions.
 In the end, I think they should charge for the API but it should cost much less or there should be some sort of tiered-based system. What they are charging for now, makes no sense. No one is going to pay the cost so why bother doing it in the first place...unless their idea is to destroy 3rd party apps and pretend it&#x27;s for monetary reasons.

                              <span>We have a pair of older VMware 5.5 host servers along with an HPE StoreVirtual SAN. Our SAN is starting to run out of space and we don&#x27;t have the money to replace the whole thing at the moment (I can&#x27;t add nodes because StoreVirtual is discontinued). I am looking for ways to free up some space on the SAN and the prime candidate would be to move our primary file server as it is using 2.75TB of space. The two VMware 5.5 host servers have 5 TB of local RAID as this was originally used for VM storage before we got the SAN. So, I am trying to figure out how to create a HA file server using this empty space. My first idea was to just setup two new VMs and cluster them but that requires shared storage which I don&#x27;t have. Then I looked at Storage Spaces Direct but that requires some high-end network infrastructure that I don&#x27;t have. I have looked at trying to setup some sort of mirrored storage in VM directly but I don&#x27;t see any way to do that. Nor can I add disks from two different hosts to the same VM to do OS based mirroring. My last option is to use DFS Replication but I&#x27;m not sure how to do this without shared storage. I would also need to do a standalone namespace because of all the things that point to the existing UNC. Does anyone know if I can do DFS replication across a Windows Cluster or are there any better solutions?

 For instance, if your organization only uses Teams and/or Zoom, do you let the users use WebEx, Join.Me, QuickAssist, GoMeeting etc. anything else they may be asked to download and install?

 What would you guys test junior sys-admins on to see where their knowledge is?
 Currently my plan is something like the following:
  
install (old version) esxi on server 
 upgrade esxi to newer version
 get vmware configured and running (attach a datastore, configure networking, configure VLAN&#x27;s, configure port aggregation etc.)
 deploy some server VM&#x27;s and promote 2 to DC&#x27;s
 configure DHCP and DNS with certain options
  
etc so on and so forth

                              <span>I have 3+ YOE as hell desk. Experience in cabling infra, basic networking, and server updates - all the basic stuff. I recently received an interview for an “IT Administrator” role. A privately held insurance company whose had all of their IT outsourced, but now they’re looking to bring it in-house. The current contract is up at the end of the year, so they’re looking to bring someone in now and give them time to set everything up before the contract ends.
 “They have ~30 end users with MS desktops. I’ll need to establish backup procedures, check run, daily printing and recovery (if needed), manage scanning and indexing of ~1000 documents per day. I’ll manage all the vendors and manage the IT budget.” This is there outline, but I’m not familiar with what all their contractors have done for them. I’m expecting significantly more requirements, esp in the beginning.
 Benefits and WLB are good, but they want to know a salary amount. idek where to start. also, if I take the job, how far in over my head will i be?

                              <span>Last week I shared how I felt and wanted to say thank you for all the comments (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/14b53th/i\_wanna\_be\_a\_goat\_farmer/). Some were funny and others were serious. I appreciate it them all!
 I really thought about a few of the comments like: 
 &quot;Work slower, focus on quality and stop overwhelming yourself.&quot;
 &quot;6 months from now no one will care that you’re over working yourself.&quot;
 &quot; Fuck it, became a goat farmer, follow your dream my guy.&quot;
 It is my fault really for the stress and anxiety. Maybe because I am a bit proud? I think I can do it all!?
 I sat with myself and told myself, I am not a machine. I am a human. I need to have limits for my own sanity. Limits are good. It&#x27;s ok. Do your best you can. Anything else is either for tomorrow or the company needs more folks. Stop doing the work of 2 and just do you. I feel much better today. Feels like a lot of weight off of my shoulders. Today I came into work, and I told myself out loud: 
 &#x27;Do you best. Focus on the quality. If the customer gets angry, let them talk with my manager, and then I&#x27;ll have that conversation with my manager after. Don&#x27;t get worked up and stressed. Do a good job and then go home.&#x27; Last Friday was bad for me in a very long time. I almost cried because I felt I had nowhere else to go, didn&#x27;t know who I was, just miserable and lost. Thought I&#x27;d never get to this point but there I was. It&#x27;s good to check in with yourself and realize we work to live and not the other way around. 
 ​
 Anyways, enough of this. Today I learned about Azure Landing Zones! Quite interesting.

                              <span>Dear Sysadmin Community:
 The title is exactly the predicament I&#x27;m in. I won&#x27;t get into explicit details, but I work for a non-profit organization, with a fleet of approximately 1750 computers.
 Unfortunately, the pandemic caused a lot of problems with funding desktop computer replacements. I&#x27;ve recently come on-board in the last 6 months have found that 40% of the systems in our fleet will not meet Windows 11 requirements when it goes out of support in October 2025.
 My biggest issue is I don&#x27;t believe I have the people-resources or funding to replace all of the systems by that date. I will have the resources to replace some. But there will be stragglers and I&#x27;m worried of the security implications when the time comes around. I know there are some obvious solutions to this problem - many …</span>

 Currently we allow access to our Public Wifi, but it does have a password. The password was set by a previous manager and is kind of ridiculous. But it looks like I can easily set up a &quot;terms of service&quot; log in page with my Ubiquiti AP&#x27;s.
 edit: just for context, we are VERY rural (like surrounded by farmers fields) well far away from any city.

 I&#x27;m looking for options to help track/log how long a user is spending on different websites, or applications. Not my idea, not my preference, but need to have options. 
 It needs to silently installable either through PDQ, command-line or powershell and not have any taskbar or system tray icons. A task manager entry is fine.

 I am looking to find a poweshell command or any way in office 365 to find when we&#x27;re the regular mailboxes converted to shared mailbox. ( these were converted more than a year ago)
 There is a way to find the original mailbox creation date which I have but that doesn&#x27;t help me for my use case.
 Audit logs only go back 6 months, we are using Business premium licenses.
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I am trying to figure out how to clone an operating system. I would like either to make it a compact, bootable ISO that would unpack itself like a normal installation with the filesystem intact if possible.
 ​
 A little bit of background:
 I have a Dell R-series server (RAID1) and on it will be RHEL8. I will be making the current OS into a baseline, but I would like to make it into an ISO so I can keep it as a baseline. The problem is, I don&#x27;t want a full disk to be used, and make an ISO that is 300GB big. 
 For a temporary solution, I thought of keeping the RAID1, and adding more disks to create another virtual RAID1, then clone over the OS to the other RAID. I haven&#x27;t gone into research with this yet as I am just drafting up solutions. 
 Another way is what I mentioned above. I thought of using &#x60;mkisofs&#x60; and &#x60;dd&#x60; to create a ISO, but I am unsure if that would work properly. 
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them. I am currently a little stuck. Thank you for the help!

                              <span>Hi.
 I am wondering if I should try to get the &quot;Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate&quot; as I have &quot;some&quot; training in security, but no documentation of knowledge. I have read this and it looks like the questions in not that hard, https://www.reliablesoft.net/google-cybersecurity-certificate-review
 I have a stable unrelated IT job and no plans to switch to cybersecurity. I think of this most as a &quot;nice to have&quot; cert.
 So I have some questions:
 - Is there anything I has to do besides multiple choice tests?
 - How hard is it?
 - Is the the teaching mostly videos?
 - How many tries do I have on the tests?
 - How fast is it realistically to do this thing?
 I have never used Coursera.
 To be honest cyber security is not the most exciting topic but I recognize that it is an important area to know

 I&#x27;m trying to add a large number of users to several shared mailbox in Exchange Admin Center (online) and I&#x27;d like to search via email address and not sure if it is possible.
 I know I can search by just typing their surname and it will filter automatically, but I have a spreadsheet containing email addresses and I would like to be able to just copy and paste the email addresses into Exchange to search and add the users but it won&#x27;t let me.
 Anyone know if this is possible?

                              <span>I currently use Intune to manage my windows devices. It’s working good as of now with the exception of removing local admin from these AAD registered devices, but that can be for another time. 
 Has anyone ever used Intune to manage MacBooks and if so, is it worth it or is something else better and more feasible to manage MacBooks?

Geez, we recently changed from workspace to 365 since our &quot;dns&quot; hosting is total shiz kept blaming on microsoft when its their hosting at fault but thats another story. They just keep babling without even trying.
 Okay I&#x27;m done. Breathe in, breathe out.

                              <span>Hi all, I’m building a small site with a few tools to address some problems on my helpdesk, currently there’s a “ticket writer” form with just a few fields to fill out that generates a new ticket body &amp; acknowledgement email, there’s a query builder with an easy interface for building T-SQL queries using the data dictionary for our software product, there’s also a “kickstarter” that you can paste an error message into &amp; ChatGPT suggests a couple points to begin your investigation.
 What kind of simple tools like these would you like to see on a helpdesk assistant? 
 Thanks in advance for the ideas.

                              <span>Does anyone use Riverbed Aternity? My boss has recently gotten hot and heavy on the idea of &quot;Digital Experience Monitor&quot; solution to improve the end user experience. While I&#x27;m all fpr helpijg the service desk with more tools, and improving viaibility into workstations, we tried it before. 
 About 5 years ago we tried Aternity on a limited engagement and found that the effort required to create application monitoring profiles required significant effort and time that we didn&#x27;t have. 
 We are an SMB and most of us Admins wear 10+ hats a piece. Most of our critical business apps are in the Autodesk/Bentley space (AEC firm). 
 I love the idea of it, but I dont love the idea of another tool that requires constant management and care. Just curious if anyone has any opinions on it, since its been 5 years since we looked at it ourselves.

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeking suggestions for a cost effective backup system suitable for a small office(10 ppl). We have one local file server with a file share available to all employees. Our goal is to backup this folder to the cloud reliably.
 We already use Microsoft accounts, so perhaps an Azure-based solution could work. Our yearly backup data doesn&#x27;t exceed 100GB, and while high availability isn&#x27;t necessary, we do need accidental deletion protection and MFA. We&#x27;d also appreciate a simple way to access backups from specific dates. 
 I&#x27;m struggling with finding exact names of products I need to read about. It appears that for each usage application, there&#x27;s an entirely distinct product, each with slightly varied names. Here are my current ideas:
 ​
  
Buy windows server 2019 essentials, shared folder is located here &#x3D;&gt; some azure filesync or related software synchronizes this shared folder to an identical fileshare on azure &#x3D;&gt; Some other azure backup  makes backup of it periodically. 
 Ubuntu server with share &#x3D;&gt; some azure thing copies data to azure cloud &#x3D;&gt;something backs it up there similarly to option 1.
  Linux server with share &#x3D; &gt; Some other cloud backup solution more suitable for that situation.

                              <span>Hi, firstly I don’t know if this is the right place for this post but I’m looking for some help with a task I’ve been assigned at my job, I’m the IT guy at the office purely in name but I’ve been asked to solve a rather major problem we’re facing with one of our jobs, we’re a renewable energy installer, we put solar onto a hotel and we’re having issues getting the inverter to communicate with the modbus meter, I haven’t been told much about it but I’m assuming it’s a case of how far they’re from each other, so I’ve been asked to get the inverter to communicate with the Solaredge modbus meter via two Waveshare rs485 to eth (B). 
 I have absolutely 0 experience with any of the tech that’s being used, I know I can’t post pictures but I can provide a link to how the setup looks and the way the two devices are currently configured.

 All I see so far is 5840 from a fully patched vCenter and some NetApps which have the recent NetApp ONTAP 9.7 P22 update installed.
 So basically I&#x27;m good aren&#x27;t I?

 The RC4 is a warning but separate to the sealing issue which is the thing being enforced?

                              <span>Hi All.
 We have a smallish estate, roughly 130 users, most have a laptop and a mobile, occasionally someone might have a couple of devices.
 I&#x27;m looking in to Intune for MDM etc, I&#x27;m new to this and would like some help with clarification. I&#x27;ve come across a few things:
 If a laptop is AD Azure Registered as a device, you cannot join to domain? It appears you can add it in to a policy, but you can&#x27;t do it on the local machine?
 Policy configurations - Can I completely replace Group Policy distributed by on site DC? Why would I then need it on the domain?
 I feel like I&#x27;m missing something. What will I lose if I take Intune over using on-prem? what are the biggest challenges people have faced from going to Intune?
 I feel this one has made me feel really IT dumb for some reason

                              <span>Hey all, 
 So Friday afternoon one of our partner accounts with the role &quot;Privileged Authentication Administrator&quot; ended their agreement as our relationship came to an end. 
 Soon after that any new user account created have been having an error code &quot;AADSTS900561: The endpoint only accepts POST requests. Received a GET request&quot; while trying to setup 2FA for their first login. I can get around this by manually adding their phone number in through their &quot;Auth Methods&quot; area on their user profile as global admin but this obviously isn&#x27;t sustainable. 
 Any ideas on what setting could have changed? Or just where I can make changes to fix this? 
 Appreciate the help, thanks!

 What steps do you generally prefer while patching servers in your enterprise? Apart from the basic scheduling and deployment, is there any other &quot;best practice&quot; that can be considered?
 P.S. This is solely for a general discussion on the various processes and to find out if there&#x27;s a recommended practice or workflow that most admins follow. 
 Thanks!

 I love it. Especially since they added the “no folders” filter.
 But how can I get the data out into csv or something? Anyone know?

                              <span>Hello Sysadmin!
 I am trying to used this MS tool to check some power-shell scripts for PS 7.2+ compatibility, I am having trouble building and exporting a custom profile with this tool, as it does not have the compatibility profile for ps 7.2+ yet https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/using-psscriptanalyzer-to-check-powershell-version-compatibility/ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psscriptanalyzer/?view&#x3D;ps-modules
 By default this is what is offered
 We need to look under the PSUseCompatibleCommands documentation for a list of profiles available by default. For our desired targets we pick:
 PowerShell 6.1 on Windows Server 2019 (win-8_x64_10.0.17763.0_6.1.3_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core) PowerShell 5.1 on Windows Server 2019 (win-8_x64_10.0.17763.0_5.1.17763.316_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework) PowerShell 3.0 on Windows Server 2012 (win-8_x64_6.2.9200.0_3.0_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework)
 I am looking to build a custom profile for a ws2019 with ps 7.2 + to use to check my scripts, i have tried using the compat collector https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/development/PSCompatibilityCollector and running the build.ps1 script there but I do not see an output for my commands and the script text doesn&#x27;t provide much clarify to me at least.
 Any ideea on how this can be used?

                              <span>Hi all, I’ve been looking into the functionally of Intel vPro, but I’m confused as to what it actually is. Are these separate CPUs that have vPro enabled, or is it a feature that can be enabled on your average CPU. I have an i7-8700 that Intel lists on its site as “Intel vPro Eligibility” “Intel vPro Platform”
 What does that mean and is there someway of using vPro on this cpu.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve set up ADFS about a year ago for two services that do not offer LDAP sign-in and now the first automated certificate rollover happened, which unfortunately caused problems.
 When the new signing certificate got promoted to &quot;Primary&quot;, authentication stopped working for both relaying services until they got updated with the new cert, the old one was still listed as &quot;Secondary&quot; though. I do not have any experience with other SAML providers and therefore do not know if they have similar cert renewal mechanisms and how other relaying partys work with that, but I am guessing that a well-programmed relaying party usually should be able to check for both (the primary and secondary) certificates so that there is a grace period for switching? Or am I totally wrong here? I&#x27;d like to bring this up to the service&#x27;s support if this rollover handling is something they can fix on their side, but as I said, I am unsure if this even is a &quot;bug&quot; or just regular behavior with other partys as well.

                              <span>Hello,
 In my Windows 10 domain, we&#x27;re currently using a piece of software called OPSI to do our application deployment and management. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s a bit complex for admins who lack Linux experience or lack speaking German as most of the diagnostic messages are in German.
 I have been looking into Winget and it seems like a nice solution for us as we could send commands to machines to update all of their software and chuck out new pieces with ease.
 I have been investigating how we can roll out Winget for a while now and have been getting a bit frustrated. As it&#x27;s a part of the Desktop Installer package which is from the store it can only seemingly be deployed on a &#x27;per user&#x27; basis. Google results seem to point me to installing Desktop Installer .appx via dism.exe and whilst the commands are complete, Winget does not seem to be available for any user, Administrator or otherwise.
 Has anybody had any joy deploying Winget into their domains? What was your method?
 Thank you for reading this!

 So today I come seeking for your help on this subject : how can I create a layout file for the start menu under Windows 11?
 My company is planning to buy new computers and Windows 10 will not be supported so we are preparing the migration to Windows 11 for all users. I&#x27;ve been working on this subject for a few days, and all I want is to create a proper start menu, without all the unnecessary programs such a &quot;Disney+&quot; or &quot;TikTok&quot; to show. I&#x27;ve tried every single things, including Microsoft help pages, forums and more but nothing works : I can&#x27;t manage to get a layout file for the start menu.
 So has anyone ever worked on this subject and can help me with that? 
 Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
 (sorry if there&#x27;s any mistakes)

                              <span>I need to figure out how to assign certain VMs to work on a certain host. If the host goes down they are allowed to go to other hosts, but if the host comes back up they need to move again to the assigned host.
 I attempted to do it via the rules by creating the following rule:
 &quot;VMs listed below SHOULD run on the following hosts&quot; 
 Result:
 I have to pre-migrate the VM to the host and once I kill it the VMs shift around the free hosts, however, once the host comes back up, they do not come back to this host unless I migrate them manually.
 ​
 Any ideas on what I can do?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I work as a jack of all trades at a small business and I&#x27;ve recently found myself setting up Cisco Duo.
 I was able to get the Duo Authentication Proxy setup and working over LDAPS, but I&#x27;ve been having a rough time getting my (Fortigate) firewall to connect to my Duo Authentication Proxy&#x27;s radius server. 
 As best I can tell, my firewall and Auth Proxy configurations are correct. The Auth Proxy&#x27;s validation checker says my setup is good to go.
 I found old posts about Fortigate firewalls not playing nice with Auth Proxies on different network segments. I saw that setting a source ip in the Fortigate firewall might help. No dice. Still fails to connect to my Duo Authentication Proxy&#x27;s radius server. My IP addresses and secret key are definitely correct. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if port 1812 is being blocked by my Fortigate firewall. Per nmap, port 1812 is &quot;filtered&quot; on my server running my Duo Auth Proxy. When I test disabling my Windows Server Firewall and scan again, I&#x27;m told port 1812 is closed. I see no obvious firewall rules allowing/blocking port 1812. Would I be correct in deducing that my Fortigate firewall is therefore likely blocking port 1812 on my network?

                              <span>The other day someone in the office wanted me to change their name at the log in screen to match their actual name. I figured I go into AD and just rename everything on that user account and it would be a done deal right? Lol. Well I went to check out the computer and had a little trouble logging it at first but go in and all of their desktop apps and files were where they were before. Name changed worked and I was like what a breeze.
 Well I get a call the next day to find out they can&#x27;t access one of the folders on the shared drive but can access all the others. I checked permissons and everything is fine but still can&#x27;t get in. I thought about disconnecting from the domain tomorrow and then reconnecting and see if that will help. One thing I did notice was the cmd still has the old name attached.

                              <span>Hi, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions for a good masters program in network engineering? I am a network engineer with about 5 years of experience. But want to pursue my masters so it can help me standout in the job market if I decide to leave my current company. SMU looks like it has a good program. But just looking at all the other options

                              <span>Say I have 2 separate geo locations with routers that both have a BGP neighbor (different AS peer), receiving just default route from both.
 I have qty. 4 /24 ARIN-allocated IPv4 blocks. The internal network is all OSPF routed, ultimately with routes connecting the 2 sites.
 I understand I can manipulate outbound traffic patters with OSPF cost internally- just send that traffic to the router that you want it to go out of.
 But how can I manipulate inbound traffic patterns if I want traffic coming to one of the /24 blocks through one circuit and the other 3 /24&#x27;s through the other circuit? But at the same time, I want to advertise all 4 blocks to both peers. 
 I know how to AS prepend- but I don&#x27;t think applicable here. I can only export one route-map per neighbor on each router I think?

                              <span>Scenario: We are going to be installing Netgear switches for on-prem raspberrypis in thousands of locations that sit behind a firewall that we have no control over. We currently have visibility into the rpis, but when those go down, I have to contact the owner of the firewall and inquire about their network status etc which is extremely inefficient. 
 Is there any way/what is the best way (I&#x27;m thinking quick and dirty because we have a long term solution coming but no one knows when) for me to monitor these switches without making any changes to the firewall and without installing anything on the raspberrypi (I don&#x27;t have enough clout to get that pushed through). For example, if the switches support SNMPv3 could I send that? Would other network monitoring tools like Zabbix be able to send traffic from behind the firewall? Does it all just depend on the firewall settings? Also, we have one valid IP address to use on their network.

                              <span>Like many people starting out in this field I am from a Cisco background, but in my current place we are an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches across each of our campus&#x27;. MLAGs are in use everywhere possible including all inter-switch trunk links. MLAGs were completely new to me when I started here, but I initially picked up how they work quite quickly, because I was previously using Multi-Chassis EtherChannel&#x27;s back when I was operating Cisco 6500&#x27;s in my last job. Lately though I&#x27;ve been tasked with migrating VLANs from old switches onto new switches, and I&#x27;ve run into problems where I&#x27;ve accidentally caused a loop to form by tagging a VLAN on the wrong trunk, which has royally pissed me off because this should never be allowed to happen. This is all because one of the things I&#x27;ve learnt regards MLAGs, at least where I work, is that we don&#x27;t run any form of STP where MLAGs are used, because the two technologies do not work well together, which for us, means that STP is not enabled anywhere it should be within our campus LANs. My Cisco background has taught me you should never disable STP, and I completely agree. Why the fuck are we doing it like this? I&#x27;m angry and fed up of having my human errors magnified because we aren&#x27;t running STP when we should. Yes, I know there are newer technologies now like SPB but we aren&#x27;t going to be ripping up our entire network to change that now, no chance. I&#x27;m just really pissed off that this is the way it is.
 Is anyone else here an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches, with MLAGs and STP enabled?

If falling back to mab is the alternative...doesnt that defeat any security gains that dot1x offers since you can just copy a mac off a printer and plug into its port?

 I&#x27;ve inherited a network. While creating a network map, I thought I found a loop.
 core  switch1  switch2  switch3  core
 I turned on loop protection (logging only) on all the switches part of the loop.
 Only switch2 alerted to the loop.
 Does it matter where I break this loop?

                              <span>Stumbled across the &quot;Open Source Used in Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.9&quot; document https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/open_source/docs/CiscoPrimeInfrastructure-39-1607443582.pdf whilst researching some Apache vulnerabilities that turned up in a scan. I initially thought well that&#x27;s why it runs like a pig, which was soon followed by an expression of wonder at how something with that much open source can be wrapped up as a vendors product and sold with the vendors sticker price. On the one hand that seems to be pushing the open source licensing needle towards the abuse end of the meter, on the other, I suppose integrating all those packages takes quite a bit of effort hence the cost.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Working in a datacenter in networking, is it normal to work with all the different technologies in networking or do they split networking team in to different group. Example one group focusing more on security firewalls and etc and the other one more on ACI, routing and etc?

                              <span>I’ve been playing with nornir_napalm and I can’t seem to find a way to run TextFSM without creating a manual parser where I have to provide the specific textfsm file for every command and vendor (got 4 different vendors on our network right now)
 In nornir_netmiko we can do it all in one line like results&#x3D;nr.run(task&#x3D;netmiko_send_command, command_string&#x3D;&quot;show inventory&quot;, use_textfsm&#x3D;True)
 maybe I am missing something here? napalm is preferred thanks to the vendor abstraction, but if textfsm is not usable with it then we’ll have to work with something else.
 any insight or help would be appreciated! Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All,
 At my org we are currently using Manage Engine SDP and are trying to move away due to support and performance issues.
 I have narrowed it down to HaloITSM and Fresh Service, I like HaloITSM because it is so flexible and the level of detail you can store in most areas in the system would negate the requirement of having extra documentation.
 Freshservice appears to have very good integrations that work out of the box but simpler and less flexible than HaloITSM.
 I was wondering if anyone has integrated HaloITSM with their RMM tool specifically NinjaOne and what does the integration do? I know it pulls in Asset information, but can you deploy software straight from the helpdesk or initiate remote control? 
 In Freshservice for example the integration with desktop central (currently using but looking at Ninja One) you get an additional box next to your tickets with control options:
 Remote control, System Manage, Power, Wake on LAN.
 ​
 Thanks,
 Omeilix

                              <span>Hi there.
 I deploy Adobe Reader to all of my users (700+) via SCCM as a required deployment. These users also have the option of installing Creative Cloud if required (eg for Photoshop, Indesign, Acrobat etc). All users have an active subscription, that includes Adobe Acrobat.
 For some users, when they install and log in to Creative Cloud Desktop, it doesn&#x27;t always unlock the paid features in Adobe Reader / convert it to Adobe Acrobat (EG Combine PDF files, etc). In cases like this I usually have to uninstall and reinstall Adobe Reader/Acrobat for it to work, whereas with others it just unlocks and asks to install the extra features as soon as a user tries to do something requiring the premium feature. I am using the new unified installer, which is detected correctly as when a user signs into Creative Cloud it lists Adobe Acrobat as installed.
 Any suggestions? I did post on the Adobe forums but have had no response, so figured I would reach out to the community here.

                              <span>We have computers that are having their Cumulative monthly patches showing up under control panel &gt; programs and features &gt; View Installed Updates as &#x27;security update for Microsoft Windows (KB5027215) - Which is on other computers showing up in Windows Updates &gt; View Update History as &#x27;2023-06 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 21H2 for x64-based systems (KB5027215)
 It may be related to how the patches are being deployed. Seems like if MS is managing you get the second situation, but if it&#x27;s RMM deployed (regardless of which RMM it seems) it goes into the first screen. 
 Does anyone know what the technical reason for that is? Ninja for example says they use the Windows Update Agent to deploy updates, but then I&#x27;d expect it to behave the same as when Windows manages it. 
 It&#x27;s much less desirable to have them show up in Control Panel, as it just gives a KB number which then needs to be manually verified to be the monthly update. 
 TIA for any light able to be shed on this.

                              <span>I can read pretty well, but most of the tech books are about as exciting as watching paint dry and I just can’t get in to them so they end up collecting dust on a shelf while I head over to YouTube and get the quick information I need.
 I feel like this, along with a steady stream of regular work is causing me to fall behind. I don’t feel lost, or totally out of the loop, but I’d like to have something going in the background, so that I can keep collecting knowledge about various topics, even if I’m going only an inch deep on 95% and going deeper as I come across a topic that really interests me. 
 I’ve spent most of career as a sysadmin, and lead a small team supporting Windows, OSX, iOS and Chrome. Mostly HyperV and Azure. 
 Anything you’ve listened to and thought everyone should?

 ​
 Edit: Here is the process I have used
  
Use Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to create the USB
 Mount the boot.wim to a folder on c:
 Used DISM to install the drivers, pointing to the folder where the firmware was extracted to
 unmount boot.wim with commit

                              <span>I have been working on a &quot;universal&quot; package management solution for my machine as of late that extends beyond just software and includes as many various possible &quot;installs&quot; I could think of, including but not limited to:
  
Windows Updates and Optional Features
 Winget, Scoop, Chocolatey
 PowerShell Modules (PowerShellGet/PSResourceGet)
 Python Versions via pyenv and packages via pip
 Node Versions via nvm and packages via npm
 R Versions via &quot;rig&quot; and packages via pak
 Terraform versions, providers, and modules
 Cloud CLI Extensions (azure-cli, aws-cli, and gcloudsdk)
 WSL Distro and in turn their (apt/brew) packages
 VSCode Extensions
 GitHub CLI Extensions
 Git Extensions/extras scripts
 Office/Excel Addins (VBA or VSTO)
 Espanso Packages and Auto Hotkey scripts
 Obsidian.md Community PlugIns
 Docker Containers and Docker Desktop Extensions
 Portable (unavailable on package managers) executables (i.e. Manually installed, unzipped exes in ~/bin)
 Rust, Ruby, Golang, Julia, etc globally (user) installed packages
  
Which leads me to my problem: I need a solidified manner to imement BROWSER EXTENSIONS into this module.
 Currently I am using the registry to force extension installations using their unique IDs and the key associated with chrome or edge. Firefox/non-chromium browsers I have working already. 
 However withough the pre-knowledge of knowing the extensions name and ID there is not a way to allow a user to install or search for an extension outside of the marketplace sites. 
 Another issue is the simple fact that this approach makes the browser &quot;managed by the admin&quot; and locks in extensions. 
 Anyone know of a better way? 
 (Not group policy or using whitelist and blacklists cause that&#x27;s the same thing - the point is for the &quot;user&quot; to manage their extensions, not some ephemeral &quot;admin&quot;)

I decided to take lunch break, and went through Wendy&#x27;s drive thru, still working on the problem in my head. Got to the window, got my order and asked for some ketchup. The guy hands the container with all the ketchup packets out the window. I was supposed to grab a few, but no... I took the entire container and drove off. There was probably 200 packets in that box. I was parked in my lunch spot, a couple miles away, before I realized what I did.
 I took it back, got laughed at, and felt like a dumbass. Tell me I&#x27;m not alone in this.

 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out if there is a better way to do this function, Currently when we build servers we manual set a static IPv4 address and DNS server on the OS level. 
 Now I&#x27;m going to have a project coming soon to upgrade and replace the DC controllers which are where the DNS server point to the pair. Now I know we can powershell and update all the windows servers to change there DNS servers,
 My question is is the above method still the sane way people do it now days with some automation tools or do we do somthing at the vcenter host level or switch level to just go these are the DNS servers so only a few place need to be updated ?

                              <span>IT veterans and those who have been in IT for years, how has spending perhaps 6-8 hours a day glued to a computer screen affected your eyes?
 What advice would you give to protect our eyesight so that we can be able to play hide and seek with our grandchildren and heck even help them troubleshoot their computer issues?
 I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been glued to a computer screen professionally for around 3-4 years now but already they are starting to feel tired.

                              <span>BACKGROUND:
 I&#x27;m using https://toolbox.googleapps.com to set up email for a domain. Mostly to see why people who register for my website get the following orange warning message when my website sends an email to a new user:
 ​
  
Be careful with this messageUserName has never sent you messages using this email address. Avoid replying to this email unless you reach out to the sender by other means to ensure that this email address is legitimate.
  
The email my website sends to new users who register is coming from &quot;[UserName@MyWebsite.com](mailto:UserName@MyWebsite.com) via gcam1123.siteground.biz&quot;. (The &quot;1123&quot; is a fake number I just made up in case that could identify my website in this Reddit post. It&#x27;s not a bad site, I just don&#x27;t want to be accused of promoting my website).
 THE PROBLEM:
 I&#x27;m using Google Workspaces to handle the email and the website is hosted on a shared hosting server (SiteGround).
 When I test my domain in Google Admin Toolbox, I get the following error message:
 &quot;There should not be a mail exchanger set up on naked domain name.&quot;
 ​
  
Presence of mail server on A record of your domain can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug problems with mails &#x27;accidentally&#x27; missing in case of DNS problems. You can check this problem yourself by typingtelnet your.doma.in 25Normally this SHOULD result in &#x27;Connection refused&#x27; message.
  
​
 How can I fix this?
 Do I just delete the mail.MyWebsite.com. &quot;A&quot; record? (I used the word &quot;MyWebsite&quot; in place of my domain for this example).
 ​
 thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pretty active power user for roughly 2.5 years in my free time and in my IT job however when I do any advance stuff on Windows 10 it just becomes unreliable very fast. that and sometimes just simple stuff, yet I&#x27;m running pretty good hardware (High end ryzen cpus, RTX card, SSD, so on)
 Sometime, shit doesn&#x27;t even work-
 I can recall so many times when I clicked the windows key and the menu doesn&#x27;t appear or try to open settings/windows apps that it&#x27;ll either be super slow or doesn&#x27;t even pop up at all.
 Sometimes Bluetooth just cuts out and stops working until I restart my PC. It is just becoming a pain now, but compared to Linux, Windows 10 is shitty &amp; unreliable.
 And no I don&#x27;t have malware (trojans, viruses, etc). Even after a clean install of windows, the shit still doesn&#x27;t work sometimes.
 I remember working on laptops that had the windows 10 os and it being glitchy here and there. 
 Even resetting the firmware, re-imaging the computers, downloading drivers, and so much more there are still so many bugs. I looked at every setting, every GPO, everything that could cause it.. 
 Does anybody have this issue?

                              <span>Is anyone running Azure Stack HCI in a stretched cluster? We have been experiencing several issues with VMs live migrating between sites, which is not a good idea. VMs are live migrating regardless of whether they are hosted in replicated or non-replicated volumes. I think the workaround is to use VM-Host affinity rules, but it doesn&#x27;t seem possible even with PowerShell. Is there anyone who has found a solution to this?

                              <span>I was talking to some IT fellows in the past few months who sadly are not succeeding at their roles. Mostly Supports who can&#x27;t hold a position for longer than 6 months.
 So what makes you excel in this area? I am pretty sure I don&#x27;t do anything exceptional or out of the ordinary. However I found out in the past few years that I am good at talking to people or as they say I have a goos &quot;social skill&quot;. The amount of IT people who lacks it is too damn high as they simple don&#x27;t know how to talk to another person. 
 Most of the times they are rude without even meaning it, or they don&#x27;t know how to explain something that is quite simple for us but not for the user, and more often then not they say: &quot;you really don&#x27;t know that, that&#x27;s basic&quot;. Users hate this sentence! 
 So, what makes you excel? Share your skills with others that might be struggling to succeed.

After 12 years as a sys admin I&#x27;am seriously looking in to changing directions and I would appreciate your guidance.

                              <span>A few days ago I saw a post or a wiki not sure. It broke down what jobs where what. It had like networking, System, and like help desk for example. Then next to it they explained what the jobs normally do. They did the same with IT job terms like Technician, Admin, Engeenier and next to each one they decribed what each was. If anyone knows what I am talking about if you can point me to the right place that would be much appreacted.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We&#x27;re a small company with one site and about 30 servers but for DR we only need about 10 servers including a file server.
 At the moment we just replicate these servers to 3rd party with Zerto. For various reasons we may need to replace this 
 I was thinking of the following as a replacement:
 Put a Domain Controller in our Azure tenant. This would be a full time DC using a site to site VPN to our onsite. So it should provide redundancy and remove the need to replicate domain controllers
 Use Azure File Sync for our main file server. Staff would still access the on prem server but we would have a cloud copy for DR and could spin up a new server and point it at this if needed.
 Use Azure Site Recovery for the other servers we need
 I think this gives us some flexibility and redundancy.
 Any thoughts on the above?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have been given the task to onboard our On-prem servers into Azure Defender for Cloud (P2 license) I succesfully connected some servers and Defender has been installed.
 I was just wondering: What is the best recommended way to manage Defender on these servers, like create exclusions for groups of servers, or to force a full scan every now and than etc. 
 Do I have to onboard the servers in Intune? Or? Is there anyone that maybe can kick me into the right direction or has some good websites that explain how this must me archieved? 
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 Trying to write a rule for snort to alert every time there is a use of ngrok.
 Couldnt find the right syntax for the signatures that i find in wireshark.
 Most of the signatures was of TLSv1.3 protocol, info- Client hello.
 If someone have an idea it can be very helpful.

                              <span>I work at a doctors office. We want a Hipaa compliant app where our employees can text and call patients from their personal phone and obscure their numbers. Some specific criteria:
 1) Only the Employee needs to install the App (or maybe visit a web link) to call (audio or/and+or video) and text. The patient can receive calls/texts like normal on their phone without having the app installed.
 2) The Employee can make the call over Wifi OR their Carrier and still have it be encrypted. This is just in case their wifi is not strong enough.
 So far, we&#x27;ve narrowed down Iplum as the best compared to many popular ones. But the only issue with Iplum: the patient needs to have the app installed in order to receive text messages.
 Does anyone have any input? I feel like it’s kind of specific but figured I’d ask. Thanks for any answers
 Vsee is BAA agreeing but their free messaging protocol does not offer HIPAA compliance. Doxy.me and pMD look good but im looking for all alternatives possible to expand my scope. Thank you in advance, again!!!

                              <span>So, I’ve recently discovered that all of our AVD images (win10 multi session) have a lot of questionable software installed on them from our previous MSPs before I started with the company. They’ve left a huge mess and installed Sql, python, ODBC, and basically a bunch of crap, with no GPOs, no locked down services or drive re-direction blocked, it’s basically a giant disaster. In addition, they set the VM session count limit to 20, with 32 gig ram and 8 cpu per VM. 
 Firstly, I think the specs are way overkill, would you agree here? 
 Second, the amount of bloat software on these VMs seems a bit ridiculous to me. A design to have non-persistent VDIs, regardless if they are RDSH or win10, should really not even have SQL, python, ODBC, and all this junk on there, that is designed physical endpoints or persistent VDIs. 
 Thirdly, I spun up a few hardened VDIs with a baseline image, 2 CPU, 8 gig ram. Someone decided to upgrade all of my persistent VDIs to 4 cpu &amp; 16 gig ram, because “users were complaining”, because they are Power Users that use SQL, PBI, etc. 
 while azure monitor clearly shows a lack of resources even being used. 
 Am I going crazy here? Thoughts?
 I’m thinking about redoing the multi-session gold image from scratch and doing it the right way. Rather than keeping whatever non sense this MSP did.

                              <span>Hello,
 I want to preface this with saying i&#x27;ve read a lot of other threads on this and know that hiring a pro is probably the easiest and smartest option however it seems like a fairly simple set up and i&#x27;d enjoy doing it myself.
 CONTEXT:
 My company is moving into a new office and as the office is currently unpowered, unpainted and unfurnished, they are looking at installing a small office network while they fit it out.
 DETAILS:
 Total employees: 15
 Office Size: 75 m^2
 We have one synology server and are a completely web based business so all our employees use laptops and we are looking to get a couple of dedicated office computers down the line. We will have a printer and probable a VoIP conference room system.
 We use a cloud based service to manage all of our business and semi reguarly are downloading or uploading multi GB files or doing video calls.
 I have looked at basically every online resource there is and have a decent knowledge of network architecture and the different brands in the space. However i am at a loss as to the finer points of which models and combinations of hardware i should go for.
 My biggest gray area is around the modem/router aspect of it. Am currently considering a Fortigate firwall and an Aruba Instant On switch and AP. We are a small business and cheaper would be better but still want to have business grade kit and room to expand in future.
 Any advice is very welcome.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having trouble finding examples how to bastion a private network to a public one bidirectionally (on-perm, not in the cloud). I&#x27;ve found plenty of examples of allowing one way access using something like HAProxy for SSH access from public to private.
 I have a layer 2 switch, we can call this the private switch. I do not have access to a router. Into this switch I have a few rocky linux machines plugged in that are on a private network, firewalld is turned off on these machines.
 I have a server with two network interfaces. One interface connects to the switch on the same private network. The other interface connects to a different switch that has access to the internet. How do I configure the private cluster to send all traffic to the bastion/proxy/jump server/whatever you want to…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 Given DNSSEC validation for a particular name requires to query all the nameservers from the root to the authoritative server to verify the chain, and that at least one (like the root) doesn&#x27;t support encrypted communication (tls), is it then not possible to have both dnssec and dns over tls?
 Am I right or am I missing something?
 Thanks!

 All branches can acces and use central RDS Server in HQ
 All MFP/Printer are installed on Printserver in the HQ so that they appear on the RDS Server
 All branches have Dect Systems and IP Phones which have to connect to the PBX at HQ
 ​
 What have i done?
 Created S2S connection from every branch (initiator) to the hq (responder)
 --- Cause HQ got static IP

                              <span>Hello,
 I have an interesting one here and its breaking my brain a little bit. I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;m not the biggest networking guy out there. So I ask this question with many question marks in my mind.
 ​
 Part 1:
 I have PFSense firewall setup with 4 different IPSec tunnels running in place with no issue.
 Two of these tunnels are going to other PFSense boxes - no issues
 One is going to a SonicWall - no issues
 The last one is going to a edge router. - no issues yet
 ​
 Part 2: no issues yet
 Attaches another Edge router to the pfsense - no issues yet
 We now have 5 vpns in action.
 ​
 Part 3:
 VPN is created between the two edge routers - to each other - along with the vpn back to the pfsense box.
 Once the tunnel is created between the Edge Routers - the vpns from both boxes drop to the pfsense box. Remove the VPN tunnel from one of the edge routers and that edge router reconnects back to the pfsense box. Re add the VPN and the connection drops.
 ​
 We have tested each VPN separately and all works fine. Its like - once a edge router talks to another edge router, it kills all non-edge router connections. Very odd. 
 ​
 So my thinking is there is some type of limitation in the edge os that is causing this issue. Has anyone seen this issue before?
 Thanks,
 Kyle

                              <span>Hi - I recently setup OSPF between my core switches and firewalls. The core switches are Cisco Nexus and the firewalls are Fortigate running in Active/Passive HA. 
 The OSPF is configured on the VLAN 33 between the switches and firewalls on the LAN side of the network. 
 When I run show ip OSPF neighbors on the switches the switches list the designated router and backup designated router on the VLAN 33 with two different IPs in the VLAN (10.33.100.1 and 10.33.100.254). 
 Is this expected?

                              <span>Proponents of transgender surgeries and treatments for minors and young adults claim such medical interventions are necessary and even “life-saving,” but as the procedures become more common, an increasing number of young people are expressing regret over the permanent changes made to their bodies. In this episode of Morning Wire, we hear first-hand accounts from two individuals who underwent these gender treatments and now regret it.

 After a bit of thinking about what could have happened, I discovered that the website was down. I logged into the SkySilk VPS portal to discover that the VPS was gone.
 I submitted a ticket to SkySilk asking for help with this thinking that someone had hacked my account and deleted the VPS.

                              <span>I opened a new tennant and bought an e3 subsciption for my global admin account. 
 I coud not access the intune page.
 Guides told me I should enable MDM to start configuring intune.
 When i try to activate it:
 Automatic MDM enrollment is available only for Azure AD Premium subscribers. 
 This is very strange.
 Did they changed this recently or am I going insane?
 Is it possible to push apps with intune with an e3 license?
 ​
 Kind regards

 Big customer with a big contract wants us to install their own VPN and certificate on one of our corporate devices in order to facilitate accessing documentation on their network. Part of this involves the VPN checking for device compliance (virus, firewall, encryption).
 The whole thing seems a bit old school, but they are a very big global customer so I don&#x27;t think we have much room to find an alternative.
 Can anyone think of reasons NOT to do this? Or reasons why this is safe to do? Any alternatives we might suggest?

 Wondered if some veteran (and less veteran) sysadmins here had some sysadmin nightmare fuel stories, figured it could be fun and informative to read your stories, maybe could help New sysadmins to avoid some pitfalls. I&#x27;ll enter the world of sysadmin really soon (just got my first job as a sysadmin 😅)
 Looking forward to reading you scary stories ahah

 What has everyone used for this? From what I know IT Glue is aimed towards MSPs with several clients - I was hoping for something aimed towards a single company.

                              <span>So- my current job has really gone down hill. We’re salaried and our 9-5 is now officially 8-5 on paper, because they want that extra hour to account for our unpaid breaks. My boss says that he doesn’t expect us to do 12-16 hr days like him but he “likes to lead by example in that regard.” 
 On top of that, I’m being assigned 9 hours of project work + 3 hours of my normal duties a day. I’m struggling to find time to even take a piss let alone a 30 min. lunch and two 15 minute breaks… I missed my psychologist appointment staying late at work incurring a $150 charge the next day coupled with a mental break down.
 They continue to drop projects on me at the end of business hours that need to be completed immediately and I can’t leave until I’ve delivered results.
 The workload has increased ten fold. My quality of work is dropping as a result. I’m drowning. We’re approaching mass failure.
 I’ve started revamping the resume and shooting it out to those in my network.
 I’m just really bummed. I was invested in the work I had on my plate. But if I can’t do that work well because I’m too spread thin, I don’t want to put my name on it.
 Is there anything I can do about the new culture shift?
 Has anyone ever successfully convinced leadership that a workload is unsustainable and counter productive?
 Or should I cut my losses and dip?

                              <span>Hi guys. I’m a new sys admin at company that just got rid of their senior sys admin a month before I joined up. We’ve got 4 rack servers all operating as hypervisors and a storage server(Synology NAS with a bunch of HDDs). 4 LUNs were created on top of these drives and each LUN was mapped via iSCI to each hypervisor, all the VMs boot and run from these LUNs. Also got a Microtik cloud router switch that connects all the Hypervisors to the storage server(1Gbps connections). 
 My question: is this an optimal set up, having multiple VMs on each host sitting on LUNs? Is it best practice? If not how may I possibly improve it? I’m willing to rebuild everything from the ground up if I have to. Any suggestions would be appreciated! And yes I definitely plan to reach out to experienced sys admins to help with doing the actual set up but figured I’d also see what y’all think about this. 
 P.S During a recent power issue on one of the hosts I realized that all the VMs lost connection to the storage server and for some reason the iSCI connection kept hanging without reconnecting.. this wouldn’t even be an issue if I was running the VMs locally (buts that’s just my reasoning anyway)

                              <span>A small non-profit art center I work with is locked into CenturyLink DSL because that&#x27;s the only ISP that was connected to their property. 
 We are looking at building a new building, and as part of it, I wanted to add conduit for both CenturyLink Fiber, Comcast, and a local fiber company in our area. 
 Total combined pricing I got was 120k
 Comcast was 20k CenturyLink fiber was 65k (somewhat understandable, as their fiber drop is on the far end of the 5acre property) Local fiber company was 35k (requires boring under the street as their is no aerial lines going over the road) 
 Does anyone have alternative options? Can we hire our own private utility install company?

                              <span>Posted this r/intune but figured I&#x27;d put it here as well in case anyone can offer some insight: 
 I have a hybrid environment with a fair few devices. I put 30 Windows 10 devices in an Update Ring for W11 but only 11 of them seemed to upgrade. All the devices were on and syncing with Intune.
 I had the Active time set as 08:00 to 18:00 so updates should automatically occur outside of those hours, right?
 I even had &quot;Restart Checks&quot; set as &quot;Skip&quot; since these are desktops (No worries about battery) and some of my users only &quot;Lock&quot; their PC and do not actually Sign Out. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be detected as &quot;User Presence&quot; or not.
 The next day, I actually manually dialled into some of the PCs and did &quot;Check for Updates&quot; and the W11 update was there (Along with the Cumulative one for some but not all) and started installing and I was prompted to restart to finish the installation.
 The pie chart on the overview page isn&#x27;t much help. It only shows there were errors with 4 of the PCs but upon clicking it, it shows each of the four devices on there twice, once as &quot;System Account&quot; once as the UPN of a user (I suspect the last ones to log in on the device). For the record, none of the devices have a primary user set on Intune. It even says &quot;Succeeded&quot; for each of the devices even though they were still on Windows 10.
 Any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong here?
 Also, is the actual &quot;Downloading&quot; of the update happening outside of the active hours as well? In an ideal world, I&#x27;d want the update to Download/Install (Same as when you do &quot;Check for Updates&quot;) during active hours while the user is logged in (To save on time), I&#x27;d just want the force restart to happen outside of Active Hours or if the user chose to do &quot;Update and Restart&quot; or &quot;Update and Shutdown&quot;. Not too fussed about this however for now since I&#x27;m only deploying this to 9-5 users but will eventually have to deploy it to PCs that are used 24/7 with only random 1-2 hour breaks in between use.

 During the post interview meeting HR said it bordered on unacceptable.
 Has anyone here had role playing questions in interviews?

                              <span>How common is colo these days?
 I&#x27;m trying to escape a poor on-prem environment where putting it in a tier 3 data center moves the internet connectivity to being the weakpoint but takes away most of the building/infrastructure type issues that I&#x27;m facing but can&#x27;t fix as I don&#x27;t own the building and even then it would cost hundreds of thousands to put right.
 I keep being told colo is dead (mostly by people trying to sell me public or private cloud) but I figure physical kit like NAS boxes and servers and VPN boxes still have to go somewhere and they won&#x27;t disappear overnight.
 Kind of feels like having 1/2 a rack in a tier 3 DC with good redundant connectivity fixes so many of those issues.
 Am I a dinosaur for thinking this?

                              <span>I received a call from that one client that would call you at 3 am on Christmas Day to fix her minimal issue. Any way, I received a call this week, one of her employees was unable to sign into of the MAC computers, she passed me the phone over to her employee, I asked her, do you know what your username and password is supposed to be, and she gave me wrong credentials of course. Anyway, this MAC is unmanaged, (I’ve been trying to convince my team to invest on an MDM), and we were unable to log her in. I asked her to pass me back to her boss, and I spoke with her, asked her to please log in with her credentials, and she told me she doesn’t know it, she can’t. Im going crazy in my head lol. She then goes on a rant on how it’s stupid she can’t login to her own computer and that the IT company should be responsible for remembering everyone’s password blah blah blah, any way this continues for 20 minutes, and then randomly she goes ok I am in. I asked her how, and she nonchalantly says, oh I just logged in as myself. 🤦🏻‍♂️. Any way I was able to take care of the issue pretty quickly after that. Anyone have similar experiences?

                              <span>i&#x27;m looking for feedback on what products folks are using out there, and ballpark pricing, for windows local admin management for temporary elevation of standard user accounts and ideally the ability to create rules allowing only certain apps to automatically elevate as needed. so we&#x27;re talking app based rules and just in time elevation, not something like LAPS which i&#x27;m sure someone will recommend, and we of course already use, without reading the text of the body.
 i know there is: auto elevate, admin by request, threat locker, connectwise screenconnect has a module now, the new intune addon suite has it (not sure if it&#x27;s a windows 11 exclusive), i think cyberark has a tool, and there are many more im sure.
 what else is out there? what are you using, are you happy with it? what do you recommend? how much is it costing you? we are in need of a solution to mange this long term and looking at what is out there and of course in the current financial climate budgets are not unlimited so cost is a factor.

More information: Is FrontEnd Proxy enabled: false. Original backend Server:DOMAIN. Send Connector Name from the original request: Outbound to Office 365 - NUMBER.
 Also seeing
 When retrieving metadata from the url &#x27;https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/9f256e05-cd04-4e8a-a28b-11b2324a97d4/metadata/json/1&#x27;, different certificate(s) have been found.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of, it looks like the send connector isn&#x27;t using the new certificate, is that possible? The old one is deleted.

                              <span>Hi guys, in win server, is it possible to make the machine joins the domain without setting a static ip address and then login using credientials from the domain. 
 I mean if i brought a new pc to the network, can it join the domain without configuring a static ip on it since it takes apipa because it&#x27;s not a part of the domain so it can&#x27;t take an ip? 
 thank you.

                              <span>Hello Guys, i finisched my IT Education 6 years ago, worked 4 years in 1 and 2 level Support and got promoted to be Systemadmin as the old Sysadmin left. So for nearly 2 years im sysadmin in my company but dont feel like i did sysadmin stuff (rather made 2 level Support for the Headoffice) and never really cared for our security or updating our Windows server. Now we hab a big hacker attack and they destroyed a lot by encrypting files (my luck i made a backup of most things). My boss still wants to keep me as everyone says its not my fault that i didnt know what to do and the old sydadmin used one password for everything. 
 Now i wonder how can i get better in what i do and become a good sysadmin ?

                              <span>I connected to a company guest wifi 2 times. I visited some websites among them 2 records client IPs and country of the IP in the security logging page in users account.
 The astonishing thing to me that both websites recorded wrong country (not my current country) associated with the IP ??
 x.x.x.x is the public IP of the company guest wifi i&#x27;m connecting to. It is my country IP ownership and I verified that online and it&#x27;s true 100%
 The problem is both websites recorded the same wrong country in the security logging page in my account.
 WIFI IP &#x3D;&#x3D; x.x.x.x , Ownership Country &#x3D; My Country --&gt; Recorded Country from both websites &#x3D;&#x3D; Other Country (the same country recorded in both websites).
 What&#x27;s happening here if I they use vpn/proxy i should see the Other Country in any ip geolocation website but, it was not the case and they show my country as owner of x.x.x.x (and it&#x27;s true thing) but how they disguised my country for the websites i&#x27;m visiting?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have around 1/3 of our laptops as Lenovo. But many are using Dell Dock instead Lenovo dock station. This against my advice.
 With Lenovo Commercial Vantage (LCV), seem LCV is trying to detect the dock and patch are failing. I asked the tech connecting to a Lenovo dock and LCV was able installing the fix and other fix did appear.
 This week, 2 laptop using Dell dock failed rebooting Windows 10 after flashing the BIOS. We ended resetting the computer and one did not even reboot after that. Not sure if it is because the laptop were using Dell Dock.
 Anyone would like sharing his experience?
 Thanks,

 It used to be a good place to come a share knowledge and ask technical questions. I&#x27;m not quite sure when this changed, but some people REALLY need to get off their high horses and remember end users who cant do simple things is why you have a job.
 Im sorry but you are simply not a good sysadmin/engineer/helpdesk or whatever if you cant deal with users who cant turn a monitor on or something similar without completely losing your cool and turning to reddit to moan about it.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 As you may have guessed, I have a laptop where I have windows 11 and arch linux Installed in dual boot mode. This is nice and worked well for me until recently.. I need something that can scale, reprovisioned quickly, and has direct hardware access (GPU abd PCI devices).
 My laptop has pretty good specs (16 cores, 32Gb memory, and 2 TB storage one M.2 SSD and one SATA SSD).
 I want the 2 systems to share one partition as a data partition. For example i can store virtualbox VMs on that partition and be able to use these VMs on both windows and linux.
 I am currently reinstalling both systems to clean them up because I was installing alot of programs and stuff to learn and it is now too much to be cleaned, I also neee to repartition the drives with different sizes, but its not fun at all, takes alot of time and effort.
 SO, I was thinking that I can use my laptop as a virtualization server (with proxmox for example) and install both my systems as VMs and have all the advantages that proxmox offers with managing these VMs and their resources). But I am not sure how user friendly will this be for me, and what are the limitations of such architecture? 
 I appreciate any suggestions or if you have other good ideas for my setup, this might become a thing in the future :)

                              <span>Hi all,
 We have a 2019 rds we connect to in the office, printer have however been a nightmare, we use hp m400 series with 2 trays and a Ricoh MFD.
 Are printers are set to have sleep mode disabled so it&#x27;s not adding additional time waking up.
 Using easyprint it&#x27;s so slow 20 seconds for one page document to print.
 We are using the hp universal pcl 6 driver locally.
 We tried loading the driver on the rds and changed the policy to use the driver first if matched then easy print. 
 While this has reduced our printing time to 3 seconds it doesn&#x27;t retain any print settings so tray assignments are automatic instead of set and duplex (double sided printing) setting doesn&#x27;t carry over and work.
 After doing some testing here is what the numbers look like
 Printing using easy print
 Click print - job sent to printer queue on the rds, stays there for 10-12 seconds, sends the job to the local machine takes around 4-5 seconds to send and then another 5 - 8 seconds for the job to physically print.
 Printing using matching Drivers
 Click print - job sent to printer queue on the rds 1-2 seconds, sends to local Machine 1-2 seconds, Physically prints out 3-4 seconds. But doesn&#x27;t retain any local printer settings.
 Has anyone got a solution for easyprint? Or does anyone know of a way we can carry over the local print settings when using the matching driver?
 We have looked at importing the printer registry keys on the rds so it retains settings but heard this can be a nightmare and not reliable.

 Should I convert the lists into groups? Or should I have groups just be for teams/SharePoint and not visible in the address book and create new dist lists with the current emails used by some of the groups?

                              <span>We use laptops in my company so we always pair them with a 24&quot; monitor and a docking station.
 The amount of times that new users join and can&#x27;t understand how a dual monitor setup works, straight up scares me!
 &quot;So If I want to type on the big laptop, do I need a second keyboard?&quot; (Laptop referring to the extra monitor)
 &quot;I&#x27;m opening a file but it opens on my OTHER laptop, I can&#x27;t work like this!&quot; (Drag and drop works wonders)
 &quot;OK I drag and drop from one monitor to the other, where does the file get saved?&quot; (Please kill me)
 &quot;My computer isn&#x27;t working... I set up as I do every morning but the mouse doesn&#x27;t go to the second computer. I have to pull the mouse in the opposite direction to get it on the big COMPUTER..&quot; (user decided to switch the laptop position randomly) 
 I have written user guides, provide a tutorial when a new joiner comes, explain how it works and how it should he used but I still get these questions daily even from staff that has been there a while.

                              <span>Hello all. I have set up eve-ng in ESXi. Everything is working just fine except in the following scenario. 
 I have one switch and one cloud vision installed and connected to cloud0. They can ping 8.8.8.8 ie go out to the internet but they can’t ping each other. 
 The eve-ng host is 172.17.18.7 and using this up as gateway for the the others two machines. 
 Cloud vision is 172.17.18.14 I can access the webui on this ip
 sw01 is 172.17.18.243 and I can access its webui. 
 But the two machines can’t see each other. 
 All I want to do is be able to see this sw01 in my cloud vision instance so that play around with deployment. 
 Any help or guidance you are able to provide is greatly appreciated. 
 Thank you

                              <span>Has anyone figured out how to either access the image ID from within the router interface or find the router serial number from AWS?
 I have a number of Cisco SD-WAN images in the cloud, a list of the EC2 IDs, and a list of the router serial numbers. I am trying to figure out a way to programmatically figure out the correct association between the two lists.
 The best idea we have so far is to add hostname and IP address fields to each report and compare those, but I’m worried that is not a safe design for a global enterprise where ip addresses can be reused in different geographies.
 Open to other ideas as well. Ultimately trying to hopefully find that one system contains a list of the other’s unique identifier.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m curious what is the general consensus regarding the preferred underlay routing protocol to use in an ip fabric network that is made of 300+ switches ?
 From what i&#x27;ve gathered using a IGP like OSPF seems like the easiest choice given how simple it is to deploy and it would allow you to use ip unnumbered interfaces which reduces the complexity of the deployment. However you would end up with LSA floods anytime there is a topology change, but maybe that is no longer a big deal since switch CPUs and memory have become more powerful nowadays.
 On the other hand there is BGP it&#x27;s less &quot;noisy&quot; allows for better administrative control of the underlay network, however it would increase the complexity of the network configuration although that might not be a big deal thanks to network automation tools.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 As a bit of background, I work in a university research lab and was tasked with planning out a system that could emulate short haul networks using amplitude modulated transceivers (we&#x27;re doing work with multi-core fiber and spatial division multiplexing). 
 Ideally i&#x27;m looking for a system configuration that would enable the use of multiple different QSFP28 transceivers to just send out PRBS traffic that we couple into our channels, but i&#x27;m not exactly sure if there&#x27;s an easy way to get this up and running. In the past I&#x27;ve worked with QSFP-DD and OSFP transceivers that had internal PRBS engines, but I don&#x27;t know if this is standard for QSFP modules or if that would be a standard feature on the PHY&#x27;s in a switch, and I&#x27;m still trying to parse the CMIS standard.
 Would it be as easy as just getting a switch like the FS S8550-6Q2C, and some different 1310 and 1550nm QSFP modules, or would it have to be done using multiple QSFP28/+ Evalboards?
 I apologize if this is off topic, but we&#x27;re trying to emulate an enterprise network at layer 1 so I hope it&#x27;s allowed, and i&#x27;ll try to answer any questions to clarify things.

                              <span>I have a customer who is purchasing a large order of branch routers and requires configuration before shipping. They have a project where they need static public IP addresses for I think 12,000 devices. They&#x27;ve determined that port forwarding is not an option and of course there is no way to get that many IPv4 addresses. Problem is, the device we have to ship for whatever reason does not do automatic prefix delegation properly. Even if I manually configured router advertisements using the ISP&#x27;s statically assigned network prefix, it still doesn&#x27;t route properly.
 After a week of back and forth, finally engineering admits that the product doesn&#x27;t support prefix delegation for the LAN side and that the only way to configure this is to use NAT66. I&#x27;m well aware of how NAT66 works and I&#x27;m aware that it serves no purpose in the IPv6 world. I agree that thinking NAT improves security is just silly.
 With all that out of the way, unfortunately I don&#x27;t have any other options and we have to ship these routers out as working to the customer. I&#x27;ve read the RFC and seen some of the potential negatives of this, but I wanted to see if anyone has a real world scenario where a NAT66 deployment failed or caused issues. I don&#x27;t know exactly the specifics of what this customer is deploying. Only thing they said was that they wanted 12,000 devices behind a gateway to have a static public IP address.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been with a new shop for the last couple of months, and I was basically brought in to clean the place up. There has been absolutely zero policy or procedure for the past 20 years, and as a result everything is a mess. There is no coordination and the sysadmins spend their time fighting with each other about priorities. Systems are all inconsistently configured. it&#x27;s a mess. But they&#x27;re paying me quite well and I&#x27;m up for a challenge.
 However reading on here, and dealing with these guys at the new company, it&#x27;s amazing how just absolutely resentful people are about structure, policy and procedure. 
 Most of the guys I work with think there needs to be policy and procedure, but each of them think their version is what everyone else should follow.
 I&#x27;m developing standards, and giving them opportunities for input, but they&#x27;r fighting me the whole way. A lot of it is stuff people here probably would think is reasonable: building machines from standard templates, using a password database, scripting out common tasks.
 I&#x27;m going to get what I need one way or another even if it means a lot of these people have to find other jobs, but it truly is fascinating watching people fighting common sense, hard.
 The usual &quot;this will make your life better&quot; and &quot;we will create a more stable environment so you guys are not on call so much&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to help with this crowd. It is definitely an interesting situation.
 I&#x27;m doing my best to lead people down the right path, but eventually I&#x27;m going to have to switch to an authoritarian leader who gives orders if all else fails here.

Occasionally when I run a df command it will take about 5 or 6 seconds for the results to come back. I have several nfs mounts attached to this server. Most of the time the command comes right back but randomly it might take about 5 seconds or so. 
 DNS doesnt seem to be an issue as it can resolve and I can access the same mounts via a windows client just fine during the issue. Is this normal for NFS? Anyone run into this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve inherited an environment which has Trellix/McAfee on all win10 workstations.
 My first impression was everything was so much slower.. so I did some benchmarking against just having defender on.. whether it’s boot up time, slow UI and even trying to tab through options in power shell..
 We only have real time scanning on, no schedules, and none of the options in policies seem to be out of place. 
 Sadly I can’t push to switch right now, so I have to try and make it better.. documentation and the McAfee support team haven’t been much help. 
 So I’m looking for tips and tricks to maintain security but improve the general performance. And it’s mainly just within the OS itself (Win10 22H2 Enterprise monthly). Are there any OS processes I need to exclude from scanning or anything?
 Many thanks!

 Them: &quot;Ok&quot;
 Me: remotes in and sees them working on something &quot;Are you busy or can I try to get this fixed up for you?&quot;
 Them: &quot;I&#x27;m not busy go ahead&quot; continues using PC and clicking around while I&#x27;m also trying to fix their problem
 Me: locks their input
 Them: restarts computer because&quot;it&#x27;s not working&quot;
 God I hate stupid people. Between this and people just closing TeamViewer as soon as I remote in I&#x27;m about to scream.

                              <span>We are a VMware/Microsoft shop, with a couple of legacy applications and a massive document management system. Thinking about shifting to Azure, and thinking about lifting and shifting as most hardware is out of support. It’s probably not ideal, but could be the quickest? 
 Vendor’s suggesting (or flogging) private cloud due to latency issues…. but I don’t see what kind of latency issues I’ll face. 
 Anybody with thoughts on this?

                              <span>I work in a Windows environment, but we have 2 Macs floating around because, they are in Marketing and Communications and NEED a Mac to work on.
 We use JAMF to monitor these Macs...well the other day, one of the users Teams me in a panic...&quot;I can&#x27;t use my mouse!&quot; on the login screen.
 As I am talking to the user, the berating begins...&quot;Why can&#x27;t you fix this? JAMF is messing up my machine, this software is bullshit. Me and (Other Mac User) are always having problems now since this was installed.&quot; on and on it goes....
 Solution? Told her to use her keyboard and she was able to login and mouse worked just fine. Next day and day after, mouse works just fine.
 During this persons rant, I asked &quot;What other issues are you experiencing?&quot; Answer: &quot;I don&#x27;t have time to get into that.&quot;
 THEN I CAN&#x27;T HELP YOU, STOP BASHING THE IT DEPARTMENT!
 This person is known for flying off the handle, especially towards the IT staff, and I don&#x27;t know how many more talks they need to have from their supervisor.
 I&#x27;m tired of dealing with abusive users and nothing being done about it.

 Proceeds to work at a fraction of the pace and capabilities on a non-working PC for an hour when she could have just spent 5 minutes restarting, which would have (and did) solve her problem.

Nobody knows about them, or asked me to develop them, I don&#x27;t even have a development background or experience, and I&#x27;m not even a sys admin (sorry, just a lowely admin). I don&#x27;t want this to become an expectation of my job duties because while they&#x27;re mostly simply, they were extremely difficult for me to make and it took several months. 
 I just run them when I&#x27;m the one on call.

 Writing it is hard, keeping it correct is harder.
 I have spent several days writing a guide on how to accurately run a specific process. If/When that process changes, I just hope someone updates the document too!

When you work in an environment where SLA&#x27;s are expected to be met and you want things done in a certain time frame give your GD IT department a chance to look through and thoroughly troubleshoot or dont even bring up the issue at all. Not all issues can be solved in less than five minutes and if you really want something to be fucking solved quit giving your IT department the whole &quot;Im too busy&quot; non sense. Dont even submit it then if that is the case.

                              <span>Currently working as an Azure Support &#x27;engineer&#x27; (don&#x27;t feel like I deserve the engineer part, I just fix shit). Case load has gone up, quality is going down. More work is thrown at me, and expectations are high. Customers emailing me constantly for updates, but I don&#x27;t have time to research since I am trying to meet these god damn SLA&#x27;s which my response quality has lowered significantly. So new clients are not getting my best, current clients want their stuff to be fixed NOW and each day I am stressing knowing I am bound to get more new work. I&#x27;m tired. I asked for a few days off in July a couple weeks ago, all of it denied. 
 I enjoy working in the cloud, and scripting but I am getting burned out and I feel it. I feel so much stress. I struggle to sleep. I&#x27;ve always had my shit together, but each day I feel like I am losing control. I don&#x27;t even get paid much for the stuff we do and am willing to go back to help desk with a lower pay for now, just no more stress. Hell, I even applied for simple sale&#x27;s jobs. I don&#x27;t know what to do anymore to be honest. Market also sucks kind of. Been getting interviews and make it to the last round but always get the &#x27;We have decided to move forward with other better candidates. Good luck&#x27;. I want to quit so bad, but I only have enough money to get me through the next 3 months without working. Should I quit, and just get a simpler job for now for cash flow, while I patiently apply elsewhere?

 My users occasionally need to share files with parties outside of the organization. Long time ago something like FTP was the only option (outside of external drives) but who uses that nowadays? What are your preferred ways? Any recommendations?

                              <span>I work at the help desk in a small office environment. My senior that does all the actual complicated admin work operates remotely and is notoriously difficult to contact. As a result, much of the work is done by me when it really shouldn’t be. I’m in school, but lack a lot of formal training. I’m more or less just the “guy that knows computers”.
 A user reported to me that their HP printer did not work. This is a printer that only this one user uses, and has never had any issues before. I try to print and the computer says there isn’t even a printer connected, so I look and it’s not showing on the network. I add it directly by ip, but jobs still won’t leave the queue. So I check the printer itself and it can print a test page just fine when I do it from the printer. I figure it’s a driver issue, so I get the newest drivers from HP’s site and it finally works!
 The problem comes when I report to my senior that I solved the issue and how I did it. This kind of thing usually does not get a reply from him. However this time he called me on the phone, which is SUPER out of character. He sounds super angry. He tells me that “printer drivers haven’t changed in 40 years.” And that we just needed to “direct the traffic properly next time.” He goes on to explain to me that this was a “big no no” and that future printer concerns should be directed to him.
 Where did I go wrong here? Like I said I’m not formerly trained, but I’ve never once heard anyone ever say that there was an issue with just getting drivers from the official source for a printer. I also did not really understand what he meant by directing the traffic.

 In my current sysadmin position I decided to give them a try again, since the owner of the much smaller organization I work for currently doesn&#x27;t want anything coming from Amazon. 
 I have found the salespeople to be completely ignorant of product information and endure relentless sales calls from them trying to drum up business.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked with Dell Enterprise many tines over the years and have received nothing but quality support.
 Brand new StoreEasy 1660 will not boot into Windows server 2019 IOT setup.
 Detailed all of the information in my case, including screenshots.
 HP Support sent me this... my responses in bold
 Could you please provide details:
  
Current OS on the unit - The current OS should be windows server 2019 IOT that is included with the HP Store easy product.
 
What are we trying to achieve - I am attempting to deploy this brand-new NAS to my environment, and it will not boot into the windows installation provided by HP via factory install. I detailed this in the case.
 
Error you are getting? - I attached a screenshot of the error I am getting in the case. Basically, the server finds the windows bootloader, and it errors out the windows installation before I can do anything with the server. It then reboots when I click OK and goes to the same error again.
 
 HP Support then sends me a tool where I have work work with a CAB file that the tool makes. OK great, boot into windows, use their tool and send them the file they need for analysis... 
 Except I can&#x27;t boot into Windows!!!
 Working with level 2 they want me to download the recovery media... I understand that the recovery media will probably solve the issue, reinstall Windows Server 2019 and I&#x27;ll be good to go. Issue is, the link they sent shows the product no longer active in HPE&#x27;s Software Center.
 Running SUM right now to run all updates to firmware, etc and I&#x27;m stuck on the localhost self inventory of the HDD firmware... for an hour and a half.
 I have a call at noon with the support engineer, and of course I&#x27;ll be nice to them but seesh.

                              <span>Good morning all, Im hoping this is a quick and easy question.
 Im fully in the Intune world, and really having good luck with it over the last year and a bit. With that, we allow BYOD devices, which is also working great.
 Up to this point, we have only allowed enrolment for phones that the organization was paying for, either outright bought and paying monthly for, or compensating some amount directly to the employee.
 It&#x27;s never actually come up, weirdly, until yesterday. Our policy for BYOD doesnt address this, so we might want to get that changed.
 In my opinion, if the user wants their work email on their phone, and willing to download and install the profile, it&#x27;s secure, and therefore good in my books - who&#x27;s phone is or is not being paid for is not mine to manage.
 I thought I would reach out to the hive mind and see if that aligns with others as well.
 ​
 edit: haha, BYOB. Seems that came off the fingers a little too easy. I mean BYOD. Oy.

Has this always been the meaning of sysadmin or is it a euphemism that has been introduced in the past? When I thought of sysadmin I was thinking of people who maintain windows and Linux servers.

 I thought excel is suppose to save teh tmp. files on the location where the file is in this case the network shares, hence to prevent any corruption from network interruptions

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!
 In this thread, feel free to show us your pet project, YouTube videos, blog posts, or whatever else you may have and share it with the community. Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, or links that appear to be monetization-grabs will still be removed.

                              <span>Hi all, struggling with the above for a single user. 
 Would of posted in Techsupport but they are currently down.
 User recently upgraded from 2016 to 365 outlook and now internal address book users are displaying their title in their outlook profile picture initials
 e.g Aaron Rodgers is now MA rather than AR 
 Probably something really simple but was struggling with my google-FU for the right terminology to describe the issue and was returning bogus results. ChatGPT was no help either.
 Fine for all other users to my knowledge and even updated my own outlook to make sure it wasn&#x27;t part of an inclusion update from Microsoft (Pronouns and that)

 How would you go about using/editing movies (maybe an nas), music, text files on a local server? How would these things be done in a commercial sense?
 Or can i just use a nas for all of these? what is the best server setup for personal use?

                              <span>Hey everyone, printers gpo management is nightmare, at least to me.
 What I am trying to setup:
 Printers client gpo, with default printer.
 Printers users gpo, for those who roam the facility.
 ​
 Printers client gpo: 
 I&#x27;ve done it, it works, set it to replace, apparently never fails to connect the printer and it&#x27;s actually default.
 ​
 Printer users gpo:
 I&#x27;ve had mixed results, very often we receive complaints abut missing printers ( a simple gpupdate recconnects them) and this is super annoying, both for us and the users.
 To mitigate this behaviour we tried to place a &quot;delete all&quot; action as first action.
 This improved the situation, bur never really solved it.
 ​
 We want to autoremove a printer from a user, if she/he changes department.
 Replace, caused reconnecting o deploy issues, the above method too.
 Update action just updates the printer, does not remove it.
 ​
 How do you actually approach this situation?
 ​
 Thank you to whoever will read this and reply

 At least he doesn&#x27;t have to worry as much about support these days, but anyway.
 Our small but geographically spread out organization had a GPO targeting Win10 Pro 21h2, support ended this week, so we moved to 22h2. Two more years without getting new licenses at least.
 It was the way upgrades to Win11 were blocked, so it&#x27;s only a matter of time before users are prompted to upgrade.
 Did communicate on that, but would still rather block it org wide.
 It is extremely annoying. 
 This thread I found seems to be the most helpful one.

 The problem with this is that it blocks the new web based client. Naturally I turned to CA policies and created one which successfully blocks access to Outlook in every medium except the official clients (this policy affects teams over the web as well, but that&#x27;s ok with the company). 
 The real problem is that blocking exchange online in CA also block Microsoft Forms, which our HR uses a lot. I tried excluding MS Forms in my policy but this didn&#x27;t work. Has this happened to any of you guys and if so, how did you manage to overcome it? Sadly, MS learn pages don&#x27;t seem to provide a clear solution.

                              <span>We have an PBX which requires a certificate on our domain (sip.mydomain.com). Last year we installed the certificate for the first time so I had to do DNS verification by adding a TXT record onto sip.mydomain.com to verify ownership. 
 This year the certificate was expiring so I arranged with the support provider to install a new certificate. I asked for the TXT record to verify ownership and was met with confused responses. It turns out they just asked GoDaddy for a renewal and they issued a brand new certificate for another year on the same domain. 
 To be clear, I&#x27;ve removed the TXT record from last year, so there is nothing to verify that I&#x27;m still the owner of the domain. 
 I highlighted with the support company that this is scary that GoDaddy would issue a certificate without renewing the proof but was told I&#x27;m wrong and overreacting. 
 Am I?

                              <span>Hello,
 We have a conditional access policy in place, designed intentionally to block all applications except for a select few exclusions. 
 The reason we are blocking everything down and opening up for specific applications in Conditional Access is because the user is a local admin on these clients and therefore we assume that the client are &quot;compromised&quot;. And because of that we have hardened applications/resources that are made available for the user / client. 
 We are facing an issue with the sign-in Office applications (word, excel, powerpoint etc) and MS Edge profile sign-in. The problem is not due to this overall policy, but rather the difficulty we are having in correctly identifying and adding the required resources for these specific applications to the exclusion list.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to ask how do you handle different Fortinet lifecycles when you have a Fortigate firewall:
  
Software &amp; Firmware Life Cycle
 Hardware and FortiCare Service Contract Life Cycle
  
For example a Fortigate 30E only supports FortiOS 6.2 that according to https://endoflife.date/fortios wil reach end of support on 28th Sep 2023. I know also that its End of Engineering Support was on 28th Mar 2022.
 Meanwhile, according to Fortigate end of support and end of life explained Forticare support for the same model will cease on 31st March 2027.
 Do you already replace this models or do you keep them?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 I want to automate Outlook signature creation for users. We use MS Office 2021 Standard and Exchange Server 2019.
 I have made PS script which replaces data in .HTM template and puts it in Signature folder for each user in GPO. Then it calls Outlook.exe to apply signature for user.
 The problem is - my signature is made in MS Word as table with text and images. Images are hosted at imgbb and placed in HTM code. When i open Outlook and apply signature it says that it cannot load images from the source.
 My suggestion is that Outlook is blocking external links with some security policies or it cant handle images as links when applying signature to Outlook.
 My questions are:
 1) What can i do to make images work without creating other files/folders rather than .HTM file? I have tried manually replace images in code with base64 encoding but it didnt help. Maybe i can generate HTM signature template with some external services.
 2) Is there any other way to generate signature for Outlook users? I dont want to use transport rules at Exchange server because i dont know how to generate specified signature with user data (name, surname, phone number) in one rule.

 &quot;As a salaried employee, there is not a clear line between work hours and non-work hours (though we try to minimize work required in evenings / holidays / weekends), this is the primary difference vs an hourly based employee.
 To ensure that people still have a balance, we provide paid time off. We strive to accommodate every request for time off but even in an unlimited time off policy, we reserve the right to not approve a request if it would cause a business interruption&quot;

 Currently there is a CL appliance taking two fiber pairs. CL nor the building owner has any idea where this circuit is nor its ID. I found some labels on the box that provide some more information but I am not sure how to decode the full shorthand.
 The few things I got out of it were:
  
Des Moines IA
 Down Town 51 West?
 Some sort of SFQ trunk is in the mix
  
Any help identifying the shorthand would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>my main firewall is pfsense (FW1). i have made a separate vlan and port to connect to a lab firewall opnsense (FW2).
 i want FW2 to work the same as FW1 with no double natting, remote access etc.
 does this look correct?
  
on FW1 add gateway that points to FW2
 on FW1 add static route with destination network being the lan address of FW2 and gateway being the same as the one i setup in step 1.
 on FW2 . . . firewall -&gt; nat -&gt; outbound . . . click the button for no nat.
 on FW2 manually delete all nat rules
 make sure FW2 is the default route to FW1 ???
 on FW2 add an any-any rule.

If I log in the actual virtual machine, launch a browser and type the URL it works with no issues. But when I try to access it from outside it doesn&#x27;t work, even from a machine within the same subnet. I am not expert in Enterprise networking, so I am not sure if there could be a firewall or any other network security device that could be blocking this traffic within the subnet... any ideas? I tried installing this software in a Windows virtual machine and a Linux as well, same result. It may be worth nothing that I can reach the machine by ping, ssh and such with no issues. Thanks. EDIT: Turns out there was a built-in firewall after all. I stopped it (systemctl stop firewalls) and the issue was gone. Thank y&#x27;all.

                              <span>We are planning to retire our existing Meraki network stack and replace it with Aruba gear in the coming year and am looking for some advice on my network setup.
 Right now we&#x27;re running two MS320s as our collapsed core (one in use, other is just idle and relying on RSTP to failover) with five MS220s for access, two VLANs, minimal QoS, so pretty bog-standard network.
 What I&#x27;m thinking to move forward with is two Aruba 6300Ms for core, then five 6100Ms for access. I know the 6100s don&#x27;t stack, but with 100 users and ~160 devices, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be that unmanageable. 
 Once hardware is in, no immediate plans to do anything fancy, maybe reconfigure the VLANs a bit, but otherwise nothing special.
 What is everyone&#x27;s experience on the 6100 and 6300 lines and any reason I should be looking at 6200s instead?

                              <span>I apologize for the length of this essay. TIA to anyone that reads the whole thing.
 If there is a quality guide for this process, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it. If you can point me toward a good resource, that could be as good as any other response.
 I inherited a mess of a network and am looking for advice on improving it.
  
Today: 
 192.168.0.0/22
 No VLAN configuration of any kind.
 
 Planned: 
 VLAN 10 (Primary LAN) - 10.10.10.0/23
 VLAN 20 (Internal Wifi) - 10.10.20.0/23
 VLAN 30 (Voice) - 10.10.30.0/24
 VLAN 40 (Guest) - 192.168.40.0/24
 
  
DHCP for VLANs 10-30 will be managed on a Windows server. VLAN 40 will have DHCP handled either by the router or the Unifi controller. I lean toward having the router handle it, but am open to suggestions.

                              <span>Does anyone agree with this? Ethernet is standard for the most part and SFPs should be too. I&#x27;m sure a lot of you here have multi vendor shops. Servers, network equipment and everything in between should be able to connect without the fear/worry of incompatibility. I know there are commands that go around this but if the next device doesn&#x27;t have this feature then you&#x27;re sol. 
 imagine if ethernet ports were like this... the internet would probably be some niche thing.

 Are there multi-vendor network managmenet systems that use SNMP write to configure equipment instead of old school CLI through SSH or worese telnet?

 1 single external user from a different company is not able to connect. (The only one from that company who needs access). 
 His FortiVPN client shows: Unable to establish the VPN connection. The VPN server may be unreachable. 
 I am sure the issue is not on our side. But for that 1% chance I am asking you:
 Have you ever had such a situation? Do you know what could be blocking the access?
 I can ping the gateway just fine. 
 Thanks.

initially the issue was that Cogent went down some time ago, but our monitoring failed to pick up on that. Then CC experienced a fiber cut in the building. So office was down hard.
 
customer called into our NOC (another failure of our monitoring) and NOC advised standard troubleshooting stuff including power cycling all devices. Customer is not particularly technically savvy and was likely expressing all kinds of urgency. Problem wasn&#x27;t fixed, so site tech was dispatched.

 I work in building automation (think programming airhandlers and other HVAC equipment for large commercial buildings) we have a 5 story building that we are upgrading with room level controllers and adding some stuff to their central plant. Our room controllers operate on a loop topology just daisy chaining one device to another to another etc, until it reaches EOL, and then the last device loops back to the floor switch creating a loop that is protected by the RSTP. This is just to have that small amount of redundancy in case 1 device or cable fails, we should still see the others on the network.
 For this project we had to upgrade the building switches to some nic…</span>

 I was hoping I could get some help getting BGP (with BIRD2) configured correctly, as I&#x27;m experiencing weird bugs and I was hoping some more experienced network engineers could maybe help me out and save me hours of troubleshooting haha!
 We have a few VMs at Vultr, and the setup that kinda works so far is to add a single /128 IPv6 address to the Debian /etc/network/interfaces file on the primary interface [ens3] - just like we would for the Vultr assigned IPs, and then I&#x27;m using the following BIRD2 configuration file to advertise the larger /48 prefix that the /128 is part of:
 define OUR_ASN &#x3D; REDACTED; define BGP_PASSWORD &#x3D; &quot;REDACTED&quot;; define PEER_ROUTER_ID &#x3D; REDACTED; define PEER_ASN &#x3D; 64515; define NEIGHBOR &#x3D; 2001:19f0:ffff::1; protocol device { scan time 10; } router id…</span>

 Does anybody have experience with Kelly as a Fibre Engineer that could input here? - I’d like to know what is an average take home pay and if this is worth pursuing.
 Thanks!!

 I have some network devices with 2FA. I can&#x27;t remove 2FA for the user used to get this configuration.
 Is there any software that can login using it&#x27;s own OTP client?
 Software that includes a library like pyotp and based on the private Key, be able to get the code each time it needs to login.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Morning all
 I have been tasked with setting up a remote office network for around 20 user&#x27;s. My plan is to use a Cisco 3750 switch (until new equipment arrives) and a Draytek firewall connecting the ISP&#x27;s device...
 I intend on using the 3750 as kind of a collapsed core and access switch.
 I have to take this setup abroad to where the office is but have never setup a network from scratch... All be it a small simple setup like this.
 I suppose my question is, does that brief description sound possible?
 I will be setting up VLAN interfaces and subnets , about 5 VLANs, setting up &#x27;ip routing &#x27; on the switch and setting the Draytek as the default gateway.
 Can I expect issues with that setup?

                              <span>We are in the initial designs of replacing some old switching for one of our floors.
 At the moment we are running a mix of brocade and cisco that will need to be replaced, across several stacks that are quite old.
 I&#x27;m thinking of deploying some Cisco 940X switches instead of 9300 switch stacks.
 We currently use 2X 9407R&#x27;s In our datacentre in a collapsed core configuration and they have been rock solid since being in production. Can&#x27;t really say the same for our other Cisco 9300s stacks around the place
 Everything on the floor would be 1G except for the uplinks to the switches in the datacentre.
 Would be around 240 odd ports, so would be 2 9300 switch stacks in 3 vs the chassis switch with 2 supervisor modules
 Would there be any huge differences with one over the other?
 The uplink to our datacentre will be the same either way with 2 ports going to core switch

                              <span>So, I have this Windows application that we are developing. It is connecting from the server to a device via TCP. This connection has to remain open so I send a TCP alive packet every 5 minutes from the server. In Wireshark this looks good, every single TCP Alive package is acknowledged. But every 40 minutes (sharp) the server is still sending a FIN ACK (without any previous FIN from the device).
 The server and devices are on diffrent subnets and I only made Wireshark monitor the traffic between the server and device (because there would be A LOT of data regarding other applications).
 I&#x27;m stuck on this. Why is the connection dropped every 40 minutes? Any pointers in the right direction?

                              <span>Hi All,
 We&#x27;re leasing a new facility. Fiber is EVERYWHERE. They even ran fiber to workstations. Problem is, the sheathing on the fiber doesn&#x27;t specify if it is multimode or single. Nor is there any other identfying part number. Just the manufacture (Berk-Tek) and 62.5/125. I&#x27;m guessing this fiber was run in the arly 90&#x27;s. Some fiber bundles are orange and some are blue (but not aqua). I&#x27;m guessing all the fiber was run in the early to mid 90&#x27;s.
 ​
 So not being a fiber expert, is all 62.5/125 multimode fiber?

                              <span>I am trying to better understand how SD-WAN Provides Remote access from sites, and when it becomes a SASE solution. 
 I have had clients ask about Implementing SD-WAN for remote access, and usually weasel my way out of the question, and implement things my way - as I do not understand how SD-WAN is a remote access solution on it&#x27;s own, or how my clients are expecting it to pan out. 
 When reading and learning about SD-WAN, it really feels/reads like simple WAN failover. In order to use it for remote sites, NGFW providers are going to have you set up an IPSEC Site-to-Site VPN on both WAN connections, or they will have you link both connections to a SASE broker for central cloud access to all needed sites. 
 I guess what I am seeking is affirmation that my Idea of SD-WAN for remote site access is correct, or clarification of what SD-WAN is really doing for remote site access. 
 For some context: I am a server admin who has self taught networking through my years at an MSP, and has implemented some fairly robust networks, but do to lack of formal education, I do not always understand what I am implementing until after I have implemented it. Is this reckless? Probably. Has it worked out really well for all parties involved? Yes!
 Thank you for any clarifications!

I have used LibreNMS, phpIPAM, and Netbox to document and monitor stuff in an environment with many IDF&#x27;s and two small data centers. I&#x27;m not the type to bullshit about my work experience. That said, what should I know about DCIM&#x27;s in preparation for this interview?

                              <span>I need a better understanding of how blocking RFC 1918 works. If I am behind a router that has a rule defined to block RFC 1918 addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) is implemented, I would not be able to access the internet. However, if NAT is implemented with a single public IP and RFC 1918 addresses are not blocked, I would be able to access the internet. Am I correct? Also can you provide a few scenarios in which a network administrator might choose to block RFC 1918 addresses on a router?

 In a fibre ring back bone travelling through 6 building including the core how many SPF modules, minimum cores between buildings, fibre trays and fibre patch cables would you need.
 One switch per building and each switch is linked up clockwise and counter clockwise back to the core.
 The next buildings on the loop come out the fibre tray and back in the continue the loop. 
 My reasoning is -
  
Minimum Fibre Cores in the fibre cable between any two buildings: Each switch connects back to the core of the network with 4 fibre cores (2 running clockwise, 2 running anti-clockwise). Furthermore, each building connects to the next closest building, making a loop. Hence, the minimum fibre cores required is dependent on the number of building…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 My boss wants to to get SD-WAN for our company just because a few hiccup from our ATT ISP last year. I told him that our current environment we don&#x27;t need it because most of our applications are SaaS and we have technically two sites via S2S VPN (AWS, and ERP). Yes, we have vocal when shyt happen but that only once or twice a year thing and spending $18k is not a solution. I rather increase my salary by $18k to hear complains and bringing back the business within a day which happens all the time. So to all networkers out there, is it worth to spend $18k for SDWAN if you have 1 HQ + AWS and ERP (different vendor) ? if not, why?

                              <span>Hello r/networking I’ve been a IP delivery service engineer for a few years and in different servers I’ve installed (not for storage but more servers bearing a controller software) I’ve found that configuring LACP isn’t used in docs. So I was wondering if using LACP with servers was a bad idea and if yes, why would it be the case ?
 Edit : Thanks a lot for your replies guys, I learnt from your experiences.

                              <span>DHCP Snooping maintains its MAC-to-IP binding table which DAI uses to protect against spoofing, but something I&#x27;ve never been able wrap my head around is why this table is even necessary in the first place. It seems redundant; both tables have the same key info used by DAI. If by enabling DAI, a MAC-to-IP mapping needs to be checked for ARP traffic anyway, it&#x27;s not like anyone would be able to poison the ARP table anyway.

We currently use Palo Alto GlobalProtect and we have quotes to use Prisma, but I want to look into some alternatives to be able to compare pricing and features to. I am wondering what some of you all might recommend or are already using.

                              <span>So my company is talking about taking everything to the cloud and looking at a SD-WAN setup. What all does that exactly entail? Right now we have a network with redundant WSAs, FTDs, and ASRs. Does doing SD-WAN require additional equipment?
 I understand the overlay and underlay network, but just curious what the next step is in configuring SD-wan?
 Is DNA center a must? Is knowing python a must? Just looking for more info.

                              <span>Hey!
 Just wondering, what are other folks in the industry using as their NMS system for large-scale networks with 7,000+ nodes ? We are a WISP and have started our journey into network automation. During Phase 1, we would like to clean up our inventory before building the source of truth, as it has gotten out of control. Our current IPAM and several NMS systems are not in sync, and we don&#x27;t know how many nodes are actually out in the field. The only information we have is the subnets the nodes could be on.
 The NMS system must have substantial discovery/scanning capabilities and be extensible, as we would like to integrate it with other systems (Nautobot or Netbox). It must also have a really good API. A huge plus if it is free/open source. Any thoughts?
 Thanks!

                              <span>$WORK is going to be moving to a new building soon, and the current gear is not coming over because (a) it is old and (b) we want to set things up better with a green field deployment.
 This is fairly straight forward corporate office setup: single firewall uplink (no multi-homing (yet?)), a few racks for on-site server gear, access layer on multiple floors for network drops (PoE), and Wifi APs. The building is still under construction and we get access in a few months (Sept? Oct?). Management wants to get in ASAP as we&#x27;re currently month-to-month on the current office.
 I&#x27;m sure the resellers/vendors will promise that they can deliver in X weeks/months, but I just want to know to know what various vendors (Cisco, Aruba/HPE, Juniper, PA, Fortinet, etc) will probably come back with, and how realistic those statements will be. We&#x27;re in Canada if that makes a difference.
 Thanks for any info.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 First time posting here, I work in a Steel Warehouse with 5-6 computers. My manager wanted “more Ethernet ports” so he plugged in a HP ProCurve 2524 switch into the RJ45 wall port and then plugged it into multiple computers and phones with no result. He then unplugged it and tried to return everything to how it was and the EJ45 port seems to be dead. 
 I’ve now been tasked with fixing this as I’m the only person who has turned the router on and off before to fix the internet /s , but I’m completely lost with the intricacies of this. 
 Any help to get the wall ports working would be amazing :) 
 Thanks, Jacob

                              <span>We’re setting up a tp-link vpn router for our small business office. Up until this point we used Comcast’s business class router/modem. We’re going to have the tp-link vpn router do the routing. To do this do we need to disable the DHCP IP routing on the Comcast modem or does it not matter? We just plug the modem directly into the the network input on the vpn router and have it do DHCP from there?

                              <span>The reason I ask this is because I was very emotionally invested in very, very entry-level tech job. I was hourly and I came in nearly every day and did tons of OT. The job thanked me by laying me off. I wasn&#x27;t even there a year. 
 Now that I&#x27;m older and wiser (cynical) I refuse to get emotionally invested into any job. I see jobs as a way to get a paycheck and build a skillset. That&#x27;s it. 
 No loyalty whatsoever. I&#x27;ll go where the money and good working environments are.
 So have any of you ever gotten guff from management or from someone who drank the company kool-aid for not being &quot;excited&quot; enough about working at that particular place?

 I&#x27;m interviewing for a position where I&#x27;d be the sole support engineer in the organization of roughly 300 people. This would be my first role being &quot;the IT guy&quot;, I have 5 years of experience in the field but again this would be my first time being the lone IT person
 My question is, how hard is that to do and what salary would you expect from being &quot;the guy&quot;. Thanks!

                              <span>Looking for some tips or even some documentation on improving my 2022 RDS setup. Converting over from 2012r2 and so far it&#x27;s been a huge let down in performance. Hypervisor wise I&#x27;m running dual Xeon Gold 6354s and Enterprise SSDs and NVMe drives. I&#x27;m using GPU-P for vGPU and currently are supporting 2 VMs with a RTX A2000 12GB. For profiles I&#x27;m utilizing FSLogix Profiles which are stored on one of the Hypervisor NVMe drives.
 My primary issue comes from RDS performance - my primary RDSH is currently configured with 20 VPs set to 100% reserve and 72GB Ram - this supports around 11 users. And it is slowwwwwww. Users are complaining about performance and when I log in I see it - it&#x27;s ridiculous. 
 However, I check the monitoring software (I use Veeam One and ProcMon) on the hypervisor and the server is SLEEPING! I&#x27;ve spent weeks scouring the internet for clues and I&#x27;ve tried several things but all of them have returned very little progress. 
 Would love some input or guidance on what I&#x27;m doing wrong - I suppose the Virtual Switch is a problem (just tried swapping to SR-IOV today) but still not getting the results I should expect.

 Root Cause:
 Traffic analysis showed anomalous spikes in HTTP requests being issued against a section of Microsoft 365 front-end components, bypassing existing automatic preventative recovery measures. The front-end components started to perform below acceptable thresholds, impacting features which included Outlook on the web, REST and Search functionality.

                              <span>I&#x27;m beginning to question whether there&#x27;s any value in submitting phishing emails to Microsoft for analysis. Occasionally, an obvious phishing/malicious email will somehow make it through defender 365 filters and our plethora of mail flow rules. When this happens, my well trained users report the message, and I further analyze the email to confirm that it is obviously malicious. Once I&#x27;ve confirmed the details, I&#x27;ll then submit to Microsoft for analysis, but Microsoft has been coming back lately with a verdict of &quot;should not have been blocked&quot;. Ummm, wtf. Sometimes they get it right, but it seems like the success rate is about 50%.
 (Hey dumbasses, I submitted the email to you because it is obviously malicious, yet you fail to properly analyze)
 Does anyone else get any value from submitting messages to Microsoft for analysis? I&#x27;m thinking I just won&#x27;t bother any more, because obviously it isn&#x27;t going to help if Microsoft is struggling to correctly identify the most obvious phishing emails. Anyone else having this experience with your email submissions? Is MSTIC staffed by monkeys?

These laptops are running a mix of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS. I&#x27;m trying to find some software that&#x27;ll let us track the laptops and factory wipe them if they get lost, stolen, etc. Is there a good program for this? I saw Prey Project gets close, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like they can factory reset Ubuntu machines. What do you all use? Thanks!

                              <span>I recently installed a fairly decent APC UPS here at my building, along with the NMC card, which I have set up to send me email notices if there are problems. This is working well. 
 Shortly after configuring all of this I started getting fairly regular emails regarding the UPS switching to battery due to both erratic power, and low voltage. I&#x27;ve been investigating possible reasons for this including contacting the power company. A couple weeks ago I found out that a tenant in our building (warehouse units) has a welder that they use occasionally. I went down and talked to them, explained what I was seeing and they agreed to let me know the next time they were going to use the welder!
 Today, they called me and let me know they would be using it in the next few minutes, and indeed the notices started rolling in! So this really does seem to be the cause of the issues that I&#x27;m seeing.
 My perception is that if this is happening regularly, then something needs to be adjusted and fixed otherwise I can expect less life out of my UPS. That said, I&#x27;m not an electrician and I have no idea what could possibly be changed or adjusted to try to fix this. I know at least that the panel my UPS is on is separate from the panel the welder is hooked up to. But I would guess that they are both hooked to the same service connections back in a common point in our building. I feel like the guys with the welder are willing to help figure this out, I&#x27;m not worried about who pays for what at this stage or getting them to pay it. What I am trying to find out is what could be done on a technical level.
 Does anyone have any thoughts? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Long story, will try to make it as brief as possible without excluding details:
 I&#x27;m a sysadmin for a small company that was acquired by a much larger company, after the acquisition I got rolled up into corporate IT. When we were first acquired I was told one of the perks we&#x27;d be losing was our annual bonus the original owners used to give us (Edit for clarification on this part since I realized it was confusing in the larger context: I was moved to the corporate IT team beginning of 2020 with a different management chain and officially became part of corporate). Fast forward a few years and the new company sends out an email to several people regarding their bonus policy and I thought &quot;that&#x27;s funny, because I&#x27;ve never gotten a bonus since we were acquired&quot;. So I did some digging and found…</span>

Our price range is $1000-$1400 per laptop.

                              <span>I see in Veeam v12 you can backup directly to Wasabi but I can&#x27;t find anything specifically that says that you can do the same in v11. Is that possible?
 Long story short, the MSP that was servicing a remote office that we acquired didn&#x27;t renew a service contract that included a server backup. I&#x27;m in the process getting local storage shipped to that office so we can do backups to local storage and then out to the cloud but I need something more immediate. I&#x27;m currently backing up to a remote share in another office over the WAN but that&#x27;s extremely slow so I wanted to see if backup directly to Wasabi was possible.

I found a link which appears to have a good approach.

                              <span>In our lab, we have a need to mount a computer sort of on the side of a lab cabinet/table (steel), and then a monitor with keyboard and mouse tray on an adjustable arm due to no space on the table/cabinet itself.
 We were thinking a wall mount, but honestly from what I&#x27;m seeing, it will have to be somewhat high, above an unrelated lab device, which I think will end up being problematic down the road.
 I think what may be the most ideal setup would be a monitor/keyboard arm that can mount to the side of the table/desk, but still allow the monitor/keyboard/mouse to be adjusted straight out in front of the lab machines.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on something that would work well? It&#x27;s just a single monitor, so dual-monitor setup not necessary.

                              <span>I would like to see if I can get an answer here on this subreddit. I work for an organization with 100 users that incorporates M365 Business Premium licenses for its users. I am looking for a solution that HR, finance individuals can use to store confidential information - preferably use a form based solution.
 I am looking for a service that lets us securely store documents internally in our organization, prevent file downloads, and prevent them from emailing.
 - Open source and self-hosted server. Looking to make this web-based. We don&#x27;t want to use share point because it is tied in with the user&#x27;s office account. We want to make this only accessible only within our network.
 - Versioning (if possible)
 - Auditing logs
 - U.I. friendly
 I&#x27;ve looked at Pydio and Filerun, however we&#x27;re not looking to use a document management system.

 I&#x27;d like to know your opinions on the best MDM/UEM solution out there. Jamf, Kandji and hexnode seems pretty good. Thoughts on this?

I mean in the DoD org I work in they install .Net on every server whether it needs it or not. Need help identifying how to tell so I can try to create documentation that none exist

                              <span>So uhhhm as the title states we have seen a rather alarming increase of peoples accounts being compromised despite MFA being on and setup. But the crazy part is the end users are reporting ZERO MFA requests on their end. They get them when they actually request them. I work for an MSP and its a number wide number of clients of ours that are being affected. Luckily its not more than like one or two per client for the clients affected. 
 I know end users aren&#x27;t getting notifications as I got a user to help me out. He has a One Plus phone and they have a nifty notifications history feature. He let me comb through his notifications (Luckily it was a device he purchased exclusively for work so there wasn&#x27;t any personal stuff) and sure enough not a single notification of an MFA request outside of ones he requested which I verified through the sign in logs in Azure. When you look at the logs I see CRAZY sign ins. Like one from Germany and the log says: 
 Authentication requirement: Multifactor authentication
 Status: Success 
 I&#x27;m really confused on how this is possible tbh. Initially my first instinct was a SIM hijack but that wouldn&#x27;t affect the authenticator. Just to cross it out we&#x27;ve been having affected users call their carriers and nothing out of the ordinary. Then session hijacking comes to mind but the fact its such a broad spectrum of people affected in both locations and companies in general, it was hard to imagine that to be it. And I know that its not just my org. Ive seen a couple of unanswered forums on Microsoft forums and places like spice works. Its just becoming increasingly more common every day and its kinda alarming as thats the WHOLE point of MFA.

                              <span>Anyone notice that Windows will prompt you to restart for updates before it is done installing all available updates? It appears the prompt occurs the moment the first update is ready for a restart, even as other updates show up as &quot;pending install&quot;. In our company, this sometimes leads to users being prompted to restart multiple times. Is it possible to delay that restart prompt until all available updates are ready for a restart? or just mutel/delay it altogether?

I can continue to console in and make changes without having to pay a yearly fee. HP only sells Aruba now, Juniper is pushing Mist so hard that it feels like a requirement, and Meraki has always been based on licensing. Are there any other enterprise brands besides Cisco that allow me to run my switches with full control, as long as I want, without a subscription?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My company are hiring a VPS to a famous cloud company, and i&#x27;m about to give sources access of a website to a webmaster via FTP sources. But, the thing is that he isn&#x27;t really experienced in web codes, so, I worked on a way to backup the web sources everyday and manage them.
 Thus, yesterday I compressed a 29Go folder in a 14Go folder in 1h20. I used bz2 to compress the folder and a 14Go archive looks decent to me to keep it for 1 day. But, the process has taken 1h20. This bother me because its a web server (even if it was a 4AM) so the sites performances are getting slowed during this time. The command I used to backup everything is this one :
 tar -cvjSf archive.tar.bz2 web_folder
 Does anyone know if I even can maybe make the process a bit faster? Any suggestions are appreciated :)
 Note, from the graphs I checked, the processus doeens&#x27;t look this overloaded (60% during the backup) but the RAM looked saturated. The RAM / Disk I/O are the slowing point I think.

                              <span>So, purchased a chinese manufacturer webcam, then got thinking about the implications. It gets good reviews on multiple sites, no indications of issues. Just wondering installing the device drivers for the device, could it introduce any sort of backdoor to the computer, keylogger, etc.
 I mean in my mind, this danger exists with practically everything, even if I buy a Logitech branded camera, it&#x27;s still made in China with Chinese chips.
 I&#x27;d hope our endpoint security and/or intrusion detection provider would see unusual traffic, but what other steps can I take?

                              <span>My company is trying to implement SSO through IAM Identity Center in our multi-account AWS Organization. For context, we used the AWS Landing Zone accelerator to set up our environment and added several workload accounts to their own OU. Our company also uses Azure AD, and I can edit groups. 
 For each workload account (there are currently 10 and will be more), we want to have both dev and admin roles per account for users to live in. With this in mind, I thought of 2 options for AD/SSO integration:
 OPTION 1: Creating a user group for every role and account, meaning that there would be a dev and admin user group for every workload account. The drawback to this approach is the higher number of user groups to manage, but we could utilize AWS managed policies. 
 OPTION 2: Using AD attributes (ABAC) to create custom permission sets that define a user as dev/admin, so that there only needs to be 1 user group per workload account, and dev/admin roles are determined through ABAC. The drawback to this approach is the initial set up of custom policies, but it results in less AD user groups to manage. 
 Which option would you go with, or are there other/better alternatives?

                              <span>Afternoon hivemind, just wondered what you guys would suggest for a cloud based call logging system. Nothing fancy needed, just something so I can start to log calls &#x60;properly&#x60; instead of just relying on my inbox.. I get no more than 8 support calls a day and have three or four projects on the go at once. We have around 150 employees and just me in IT (at the moment).

                              <span>I got brought on as a contractor two weeks ago to help with onboarding new hires and getting devices prepped for future hires with some L1 work mixed in. It was a two month contract. Since day two the Sr admin has had my back, he&#x27;s a great guy and somehow or another he believes in me. My boss got fired on Tuesday, it was amazing how much shit he was doing and how incompitent he was being. Now two weeks into my two month contract I am being pushed for full time and I&#x27;m very happy.
 This is a small organization and now it&#x27;s me and the Sr Admin, I&#x27;m going to have the admin&#x27;s back and I&#x27;ll be pulling weight around here now. I worked at numerous places that offered me things like being able to learn but with the exception of one or two I never felt like I did a lot of it. Now I&#x27;m going to get the chance to learn a lot of things, run systems and more. My background is in Service Desk / Desktop Support style roles so I&#x27;m glad to be moving up. I&#x27;m super excited to be at this company and excited to have this new job and responsibilities.

                              <span>I&#x27;m very new to firewalls, so forgive me if this is a dumb question but I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet. I&#x27;ve done some searching on this but haven&#x27;t really found much info.
 The last few days or so I&#x27;ve been diving into creating rules/policies at work on one of our Palo&#x27;s. In the gui I create the rule, place it in the correct order and commit. Apparently it doesn&#x27;t actually take this order though? It&#x27;s been explained to me that I have to cli into it afterwards, and run a few &quot;debug device-server&quot; commands and force commit for it to actually sort the rules properly. Surely this isn&#x27;t by design? If it is, would there be a specific reason?
 Thanks in advance for any input.

                              <span>Looking to implement a central monitoring solution for our enterprise. We have Datadog, New Relic, ELK stack and even a grafana and Prometheus implementation. Needless to say our monitoring is fragmented. 
 When I first got here I liked datadog but was hesitant due to the price. I will say the platform has really grown on me. Their presentation layer is miles ahead of NR. I actually dislike NR. It’s not as easy to build a dashboard and their agent isn’t as well thought out as dd in my opinion. Datadogs ability to make correlations is mikes ahead. At a certain price point it doesn’t make sense to go with NR when grafana is available. But that’s very situational 
 For my question. Am I making a mistake going with dd? I’ve heard a lot of bad things. The coinbase billing almost has me telling my team to not use custom metrics. It’s a nice product but it feels like I’m making a deal with the devil

                              <span>Hello, I need advice on how to best organize a homelab. I would like to manage a media server, create an efficient solution for backing up my data and computers, and leave some room for future experimentation.
 At the moment, I have purchased a Synology DS220+ because I was attracted to its ease of configuration and the pre-installed DSM packages. While I noticed several valuable packages like Hyperbackup, Active Backup for Business, and others, I have encountered some issues:
  
The Synology server is not very powerful.
 Some packages are not frequently updated, so I resorted to using Docker.
 Configuring some Docker containers seems to be particularly difficult on DSM.
  
Therefore, I am considering setting up a second server where I can install an OS like Unraid or TrueNAS to manage the media server and act as a redundancy for the Synology server. This way, I could use the Synology as a reliable and secure solution while having fun with other containers on the second server. Do you think this choice makes sense? Additionally, I&#x27;m thinking of buying an HSGT HC550 18TB HDD for the Synology since I found a great price (€250). On one hand, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity, but on the other hand, I don&#x27;t want to waste money if I don&#x27;t have that much data to store.
 I also have two spare 6TB SAS HDDs and a friend&#x27;s R720 server that I could purchase at a low, symbolic cost. However, I&#x27;m concerned about its power consumption and how to accommodate such a bulky server.

                              <span>I recently changed by Lastpass password (in March) after hearing that it was hacked. But would it be too late? 
 Would they have already collected all the data, so that I would need to actually change individual passwords of all my accounts that were stored in Lastpass?
 Anyway I failed to remember my new password and had to revert back to my old password. (Would this be an unsafe move?)

                              <span>Hi, few days ago, for compliance reasons, I configured a GPO to force lock screen after 3 minutes at the top of my Active Directory. 
 Users are complaining that this time is too short, so I tried to raise it to 5 or 10 minutes... without any luck: workstations are still locked after 3 minutes and I can&#x27;t explain why.
 Currently I also unlinked GPO from my domain, rebooted workstations, run gpupdate /force multiple times... without success.
 For example, I just rebootted a workstation and gpresult /r tell me that GPO lock screen is NOT there.
 I guess there is something that I am missing in controlling what GPO are applied, and this is the most important thing I&#x27;d like to understand, not the specific case :)
 Any help in troubleshooting this? Thank you!

They don&#x27;t logon using the DOMAIN\User format but the modern user@domain format. The username is abstract (think U2123651213132@acme.com) so they want the username to be saved by the RDP client.
  
 However, at logon time, it drops the last few chars of the username and fails logon. It tries to logon with U2123651213132@acm in one user, and U2123651213133@acme.c in another user. If they correct in manually, it works, but I don&#x27;t understand why it &quot;forgets&quot; a part of the user name. I&#x27;ve never seen that before. Maybe it has to do with Citrix, but to me it looks like Citrix just opens a VPN and then opens an RDP session.
  
 For Germans: this behaviour is when using Datev Smart-IT.

 our IT Team does not want to change the screen lock time of 10min for some our clients in production. Is there a software that can enhance this to 30min and simulate some video playback or keypress? It would be important that after 30min it locks and after unlocks the intervall sets again to 30min. 
 ​
 Is this possible with any software? With powertoys awake i can only set an intervall once and not after every login from screenlock.

 onetimesecret.com seems to be very popular in orgs i have worked at but it’s often misused (all credentials and urls in one secret) and it’s never sat comfortably with me using an untrusted 3rd party to transfer sensitive information.

                              <span>Recently came across a post and also heard some tech guys suggest using a blower to clean your hardware like servers and switches etc. 
 Running an air blower will just push the dust deep down to places where you can&#x27;t clean it further and cause heating issues and static problems. 
 I believe using a vacuum cleaner with hepa filters is the best way to dust your hardware.
 What do you guys use?

 I work as a senior technical sysadmin for a large university and i find myself slightly adrift here.
 Some backstory to set the scene.
 We had a major reorganization fairly recently that has taken about 20 or so smaller groups and one large and mashed into one massive group. Sadly, this was done with no plan or afterthough.
 Three years later what we have is basically yugoslavia in the 90&#x27;s. We lack many basic supportstructures and the infighting between teams, groups and departments makes me sad and depressed tbh.
 Noone wants to cooperate, everyone just keeps their head down and trudge along in the same old wheeltracks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve run into a bit of an odd issue and would appreciate some input.
 I&#x27;ve got one of my clusters reporting the following error:
  
The computer object associated with the cluster network name resource &quot;SQL Network Name (---)&quot; could not be updated in domain &quot;---&quot; during the Password change operation. 
 The text for the associated error code is: The specified network password is not correct. 
 The cluster identity &quot;CNO$&quot; may lack permissions required to update the object. Please work with your domain administrator to ensure that the cluster identity can update computer objects in the domain.
  
Now, I&#x27;ve only seen this error posted with the &quot;Access is denied&quot; code, which usually is resolved by, well, fixing the access permissions that the CNO has on the other resources in order to update them. However, I fail to find anything mentioning my exact error with the incorrect password of the CNO account and a suggested solution for it.
 I&#x27;ve had a look at this with an external party suggesting we still work on the permissions the CNO object has in AD, giving it full control. But I like to avoid just tossing permissions at things hoping it works, especially because this error does not suggest a permission issue.
 I have found the following article, although without my error mentioned, but it makes the most sense (atleast for me) for the issue I&#x27;m facing: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/failover-clustering/understanding-the-repair-active-directory-object-recovery-action/ba-p/371891
 This suggests taking the Cluster Name resource offline and using the Repair feature, as this will apparently use the credentials of the currently logged on user to reset the CNO password and replace it.
 I&#x27;d like to have a second set of eyes on this, maybe someone has even had this issue before already. I&#x27;m not too well versed with Failover Clusters, but the suggestion of the external party doesn&#x27;t seem proper to me.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Before the changes made by CA/Browser around OV Code Signing certificates, I used to create a pfx from the certificate myself using the key I had generated.
 But since the 1st of June, these certificates are delivered to me on an eToken from our vendor. Therefore, I don&#x27;t have access to the private key file anymore.
 We need the pfx for our Microsoft 365 Business Central solution.
 I have already searched for multiple days without success.
 Has anyone had the same issue? How did you fix this?

I&#x27;ve been working on creating some cool CLI tools using Go, while Python comes in handy for automating those one-time tasks.

                              <span>In this particular instance, I&#x27;m looking to set up Universal Print to make finding and adding printers more self-service friendly for users as we move machines to be Azure AD joined only. Our print server is running on a 2019 Server Core VM. I can install the Universal Print connector service just fine, but I can&#x27;t register it with Azure because it wants to open a browser to handle the sign in process.
 On the other hand, the connector service for Azure AD&#x27;s SSO agent handles this registration process via Powershell. I can&#x27;t remember which, but I believe I&#x27;ve also encountered one that prompts you to open a MS login page on your workstation and gives you a code to enter. 
 I feel like of all the services to run on Server Core, a Print Server is high up there. It seems like laziness that the only reason the Universal Print connector doesn&#x27;t support Server Core is because it doesn&#x27;t have a browser to handle logging into Azure to complete the registration process. There&#x27;s even a Powershell module for managing the connector (such as adding printers to it) after it&#x27;s been registered! The UP team needs to talk to whichever team worked on the connectors for those other services and copy their registration process.
 Another one that seems lazy to me for similar reasons is the PowerBI data gateway. Once it&#x27;s registered, I&#x27;ve never seen the need to interact with it again. It SHOULD be able to be run on Server Core but once again, it doesn&#x27;t because rather than create a registration process via PowerShell they went the lazy way and required a browser based login.

                              <span>So, a few weeks ago I opened a switch to blow out dust and found two capacitors swollen and leaking. I&#x27;ve been busy and just opened a warranty case yesterday. Last night they responded asking for pictures of said capacitors.
 Today I got an email response saying that since I opened the switch case to blow out dust, my warranty claim is being denied and I should have called them before opening the case.
 I believe that this type of claim denial is illegal. So tomorrow I get to research the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act and find the ftc ruling that was made in 2015.
 Not sure if I should post the name of the company. I&#x27;ll just say that several years ago they had LIFETIME warranty on their switches. 
 Who else blows dust out of gear as routine maintenance? Or how about doing it as when touched as non-routine maintenance?

                              <span>So I’ll try to make this brief
 The new Director is finally hitting their stride and is now beginning to map out the plan they have in mind.
 Part of this plan is to validate the need for VPNs due to them being a potential threat vector, but on the flip side wants to also revert back to RDS gateways because…..well I have no idea.
 The discussion of deep packet investigation came up as well.
 The director wants to be able to scan network traffic with DPI through the VPN tunnel to investigate if malware is present or not. From all the stuff I’ve known and read I don’t think DPI can read the data or packets in transit through the VPN tunnel but just see that there is data being sent/received?
 there are quite a few more things to get into but parenthood calls, but am I wrong to be challenging these decisions or discussions?

                              <span>I am reading that there is a min of 16 core licenses needed per server ( 8 cores per socket)
 We have 3 servers with 2 sockets each (but each socket only has 6 cores which is kind of lame but oh well.)
 That’s 48 core licenses we may need.
 We have 10 core licenses already.
 It appears we need to buy 38 more cores.
 2 core license packs can be bought for 93.00 each on tech soup
 (19) 2 core packs may be needed to give us 48 core licenses to cover all (3) 16 core machines and will cost $1,767
 Cost is way better than data center still
 Oh and each licensed hyper v windows server standard can run 2 VM’s so we have a total of 6 VM’s possible.
 If we want to buy another 93 dollar license and make sure that VM is only allotted 2 cores we can have more.

 Did I just give my boss the wrong info in my email above?

One mail flagged for the &quot;naughty scam/spam&quot; category seemed unusual, since it came from the domain of another company in this city. Looked inside and saw a conversion + attachments that make it very clear that an affair between A and B is going on. 
 Main problem: The soon-to-be wife of A is a friend of mine, so I&#x27;am somewhat personally entangled in this. I dont know what or even if I should do something. Would feel awful to not tell my friend whats going on, but I feel like my hands are tied.

                              <span>Why can&#x27;t companies just do what they&#x27;re supposed to, and not be giant piles of shit?
 About a month ago I noticed an IP address that kept trying to establish a VPN to our office, over and over. Every 5 seconds.
 We don&#x27;t us IPSec for anything, so there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s legit.
 So I look up the IP address, and it&#x27;s owned by Comcast.
 Fire off an email to their abuse email address, along with the logs.
 A month later, nothing.
 So I call their abuse number. Now, you&#x27;d think that with an automatized menu item labeled &quot;For malicious traffic originating from a comcast IP address, press 2&quot; they&#x27;d have some clue of what they&#x27;re doing.
 Not so much.
 After an hour on the phone, they give me a case number, and said that they&#x27;d escalate it, and I&#x27;d hear back from someone in a few days.
 8 days later, Nothing....
 So I call them again. Get hung up on.
 Call again, and get transferred to some poor tech in the xfinity department, who has no clue what&#x27;s going on... But he&#x27;s at least trying to help.
 I feel sorry for their actual customers.
 ​
 EDIT: Turns out we do use a single IPSec tunnel. So I was wrong there.

                              <span>3 Months ago I moved from my previous sysadmin job to start a new career as a cyber security analyst in an MSSP, they taught me alot of concepts and paid for courses to build my skills, we have a very nice management!! Yet there is alot of work pressure, sometimes I have to work even after working hours from home, and I don&#x27;t sleep well from the work pressure. well after 3 months in this MSSP I received a job offer for an Information Security Officer in a very well known bank, and they offered double my salary, and a better health insurance. I don&#x27;t know what to do, I feel like I am betraying our management if I accepted this offer because everything they asked me in the interview was what I learned from my management. what should I do ? do I accept the offer or not?

                              <span>Was contacted by the jittery micromanager of a department today to look into why her user wasn&#x27;t getting emails. 
 I asked her what email were they sending to and what email was the user checking? 
 We have two email accounts for all employees on for our company which is a contractor and the other is a county government email account that all employees receive once hired. 
 Turns out both the manager, and the clerk, and the receptionist were all sending from their county accounts to the company email. Our company has better security than the county so sometimes it is blocked. 
 I told the users to try sending from county email to county email, they all said it didn&#x27;t work because that user was never set up in county. I call county IT and they said she was set up. So I log in to test and all is good, but no one told me.... 
 I asked the users to test send to the county email as the user is set up, but they said it didn&#x27;t work. I had to go to each of their computers to show them how to type in the county email, because outlook likes to auto-populate the most common emails used. After I left their desks they still said it wasn&#x27;t working. 
 I reminded them that they have to type the email in a couple more times before it auto-fills. I wonder how any work actually gets done here...

 Me: “Hey John, thanks for reaching out about your issue. Is there a time later today or tomorrow morning I can reach out?”
 John: “Is now good?”
 No John, no it is not. 
 Bit of a silly rant and I’m grateful I don’t have more to rant about at the moment, but these start adding up and I just want to alt+f4 work for the day lol

                              <span>As the title suggests, struggling with a slight issue regarding how admin by request operates. 
 Essentially it removes the user from the local admin group and when requested by the user and approved it elevates the user. 
 Here lies the issue, we are trying to enroll the users in MDM (add work account in Microsoft settings / login to company portal) but it says the user needs elevation…
 Has anyone experienced this or know a workaround other than uninstalling the software which can have bad consequences or temporarily giving them a higher level admin access under supervision whilst setting this up? Both options are less than ideal but seeming not possible otherwise.
 Thanks any help is appreciated!

 If I do &quot;nslookup someothervpnclient&quot; it returns the correct IP address. However if I do &quot;ping someothervpnclient&quot; it can&#x27;t resolve the hostname. If I use the FQDN, eg. someothervpnclient.vpn.example.com, then it works just fine. Using &quot;ssh someothervpnclient&quot; won&#x27;t work either but it works with FQDN. 
 Wtf? Anyone got a clue as to why that could be? I&#x27;m confused.

We have a backlog of old tickets in that tenant and we either need to get those old tickets exported to the company so we can import them on a new tenant or, need to get the existing tenant transfered to us.
 We&#x27;re still piecing things together but, we think the admin account is under his personal gmail account. Is this possible? I&#x27;m still dealing with this so I have not had time to go on and call Spiceworks myself.

                              <span>Hi. Hyper V server with a VM that will not boot due to maxed out hard drive space. Management would not approve additional resource spend for this because it is going away in 6 months. Anyways, there was 3-5GB left and I was going to do work on it this weekend to expand but Windows Updates wanted to ruin my day. It kept asking to update yesterday, which never happens. Was there some forced Windows 2019 sever update? It appears to have eaten up the rest of the disk space. 
 The VM is in a saved state, I’m nervous to delete that saved state without Hyper V experts telling me to do so. I see various recommendations by searching but nothing definitive. 
  
Delete the saved state, reduce the memory size (currently 29 GB) and boot up. Delete unnecessary files and expand disk size. Restore memory back to normal or…
 Delete saved state. Copy the VHD to an external HD, boot the machine to that. Delete unnecessary files and move back… expand for a permanent fix. I see two large files, what do I copy? The avhdx file or that and the hard disk image file? 
  
Please recommend what is best. I do have IT consultants helping but he is passing it to someone else who is more experienced with Hyper V. I’m worried that may take hours so I may need to work on this myself. Thank you

 Mine was about 15-16 years ago when I was on-call and a middle age guy called that everything was going the opposite way on his computer. After a couple minutes, I asked him if the mouse was upside down and he said, let me try it and said yeah and turned it the other way and he was so happy “I fixed it” lol. 
 I still had to log it in and get paid the 2 hour minimum.

                              <span>Hey all, I got a report early this week that one of our directors is having their inbox destroyed by solicitation emails. I believe they were accessing sites for recruitment and used their main work email. 
 I have some samples of the emails, and I can’t seem to find anything malicious about them. They’re legitimate, just extremely tenacious and annoying. I tried to look for a trend in them, so we could set up some rules to just delete them, but they don’t seem to follow anything scalable and they’re addresses are always different. 
 I looked in the exchange online portal, and the anti spam rules all seem like they’re for strictly malicious spam. I might be wrong, but I felt they wouldn’t be helpful. 
 I suggested that they just used the OWA to setup their own block/allow lists, but they can’t be bothered and wanted IT to do something about it. I’m kind of at a loss here. Is there anyway to get them out of this hole that I’m missing? Blocking the sending domains could be an option, but not all of them are things we would want to block. Like Glassdoor or legitimate recruitment sites that they and others might use. The worst is when the solicitors send meeting invites, they’re getting placed as tentative on the calendar. I got them out of that one with outlook calendar filters, but am clueless on the emails at this point. 
 Any guidance will be appreciated.

                              <span>If I have ESXi 6.7 currently running in my environment and introduce a new server running ESXi 7 can I migrate the VM&#x27;s over to it? And do I need to flatten the VCenter 6.7 and add the 6.7 server to VCenter 7 to be able to do the migration? 
 Sorry my memory of doing this is a bit foggy. Last time I did something like this on my homelab was when I had ESXi 6.0 or 6.5 going to 6.7.

 Has anyone else come across this and if so what was the issue as im stumped. Both sites have a leased line, one is a sharp copier and the latter is a toshiba. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated:)

 I intended to upgrade these to Windows 11 Enterprise by assigning an Enterprise License to each user and then logging them into their respective computers. Unfortunately, it appears that Windows 11 Home does not support organizational accounts.
 When I tried to reinstall the operating system, it simply reverted back to the digital Windows 11 Home License and i have no chance to provide another.

                              <span>Hey SA
 Hoping you can provide some insight or what things i can look for 
 Looks like one of our users was attacked and sent out a bunch of spam emails, cleaned everything up but looks like there was two authenticator app registrations that are from mobile a OS that the user doesnt use. Have since removed these
 The user had SMS authentication enabled 
 Have implemented geo blocking and will ensure legacy auth is disabled but my query is how would the attacker been able to register the authenticator app and pass the MFA check. Thought about sim swapping but the users phone is still working fine. Possible phised or MITM MFA? 
 The entry in azure ad states &#x27;User registered Authenticator App with Notification and Code&#x27; and from what i can tell was triggered from a browser client app

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I am currently a senior systems engineer and we have found out our company will be closing down over the next 6 months to a year.
 I have been in IT for nearly 20 years, with 12 years as a system admin.
 With some time to go before we finish up, I thought I would look at how to expand my skills and if there are any other areas I should look into. 
 My main focuses have been Virtualisation and Storage, with a bit of Azure work over the last few roles. 
 I have worked quite closely with security teams, and find some of that quite interesting, but have heard it can end up being mostly spreadsheets and less finding/fixing issues.
 Any Tips? 
 Thanks

                              <span>I left the company I&#x27;m working at for a while and gave in all my access information to another employee. And this employee put their cell phone number as the one that gets the verification code to access the admin center, but now I&#x27;m back and the employee is gone, and the cell phone number was cancelled so there&#x27;s no way to receive the SMS or call for verification. I have my email as the alternative email but the second verification is always by the cell number. I tried doing the forgotten password and have access to both of the alternative emails but the second step of the verification is to the number. I wanna know what are my options to regain access knowing that theres no way to get that number again. Thank you and this is not a hack attempt just an overwhelmed employee that was tossed a curve ball.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have an incremental backup of 1500GB, which consists of around 17 million files, that needs to be transferred from one location to another location daily. Typically, I rely on rsync for file transfers, but it&#x27;s taking a considerable amount of time for calculations in this case. Therefore, I&#x27;m curious if there are better tools available for handling this massive task.Do you have any suggestions for alternative tools or techniques that can efficiently handle this transfer? I would greatly appreciate your insights!
 Thank you in advance!

 I was recently tasked with checking computers in AD every month to ensure they&#x27;re compliant.

 Many thanks.

 It happened a few weeks ago, then stopped, but seems to be back now.
 Happens in Edge or Chrome, and neither the browser versions nor the Outlook version has changed over that time, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a change to the backend sharepoint code, although getting ms to admit that seems to be worse than pulling wisdom teeth...
 Usually, when you drag an email from Outlook to a location in sharepoint, it copies the mail, but seems to be performing a move instead.
 The mail does go to deleted items, but sometimes fails to copy correctly and leaves a corrupt file in sharepoint.
 Ctrl-drag does copy okay without deleting.

 It&#x27;s not Microsoft RDP specific, i see the same behavior if I attempt a connection via MobaXTerm. If i connect via a MacBook, it is instant.

                              <span>Hi everyone! We&#x27;re a small company with 110 employees at the moment but still growing. Until now I&#x27;ve been on my own, and thus used Trello to organise my tasks, give priority and have a basic workflow.
 However, I&#x27;m not sure this is a scalable solution. I&#x27;ve talked with the head of my department and we want to look at a proper ticketing system. We&#x27;ve moven to Microsoft recently from Google Workspace and I want to know if there are solution out there that integrate particularly we&#x27;ll with this environment and apps like Teams. Prefer it to be a cloud-based application, would be a plus if they have a mobile app. Functionality we want ticketing and ITSM. 
 Does anyone have experience with this, and can recommend a package you&#x27;re satisfied with? I&#x27;ve looked around on the internet for the past couple of day&#x27;s and well, there&#x27;s a lot out there... And almost all look the same?
 Thanks for your replies in advance!

So my question is the following: Is there a possibility that a user exports their entire chat history from a work account? (Like a pst from outlook)

                              <span>Looking for input from anyone else that has dealt with this.
 A higher up at our company fell victim to an email hijack scam. Reviewing the messages, it is pretty clear one of the vendors involved in the email process had been compromised. 
 The email thread looks normal. The vendor requested and sent an invoice for payment on equipment.
 Two days later there was another follow up urging the payment quickly. The vendor also requested a change in ACH information. You can clearly see the email domain changed at this point and the language has the feel of poor translation. To me there were red flags at this point and had I been involved I would have urged a phone call to confirm the validity of the message.
 Another recipient on the thread from another company involved in this large purchase even doubled down on the payment request. Technically he was fooled too.
 So technically our systems were never compromised. But we are the victim since we made the false payment.
 Whose insurance gets involved here? I assume next step is to report this to the authorities. (local FBI cyber field office)
 Our company has traditionally not taken any of this seriously. I have managed to secure much of the infra a bit at a time with MFA, good AV and better policies. But my scope of oversight has never been able to influence finance and other at risk departments. Policies on ACH payments and convincing key departments to adopt things like password managers has been an uphill battle.
 Anyway, would not mind hearing how others navigated this.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello, i have a question about Exchange 365 behaviour and hope that it&#x27;s ok to post it here directly.
 We have to migrate distribution groups from one domain to another.
 The way we do this is to rename the old group via EAC and create the new group in EAC with the new domain OU.
 We rebuild the whole group settings, add the members and secondary mail adresses.
 But now we have a big discussion about the X500 adresses in the secondary mail adresslist if we really need them or not. 
 Some years ago our exchange migrated to a newer version and therefore added the X500 adresses, the groups stayed the same.
 But with the completely new group and new SID, do we really need the X500?
 Does the new group will miss some data when we doesnt add the X500?
 Or do i have to update the X500 string to the new adress or sid for working with the new group? 
 Thanks for your time

                              <span>We moved to Office 365 early on this year, but without Exchange online. On-prem for everything basically.
 Following this guide (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide) it says:
 &quot;Centralized Deployment doesn&#x27;t support the following: Deployments of Microsoft 365 that do not include Exchange&quot;
 We have the MS Store blocked, so is there no way to deploy an addin from there without exchange online?

We would like to be able to set printing/copying limits (B&amp;W and color), set which users are allowed to print... At the moment we are using Job accounting, we gave each user a 4 digit code. The problem is that after a couple of months users share their codes and the accounting is not centralized. Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are a small company looking to replace our aging wireless N APs and have been suggested Aruba APs. Our current access points (15 total) use external antennas and are fixed in some tricky places where removal is not going to be easy. If we get Aruba 534 or similar APs would these antennas work without issue? We likely won’t be utilising wifi 6 immediately and likely using 2.4ghz for a while longer due to the environment, but we have dying hardware that needs upgrading.
 Also what’s the cheapest method to manage these? Seems the cloud manager is a paid product, can a virtual controller be setup on Aruba?

                              <span>I have never been a part of a team that manages IDS/IPS and proxy servers. The question that I have is more related to applications like clientless remote desktop gateway such as Apache Guacamole, Kasm Workspaces, and clientless VPN.
 If the endpoints are configured to use proxy server with SSL decryption and going to a IPS/IDS appliance with SSL decryption, would the proxy server detect the clientless gateway like guacamole, Kasm and clientless VPN?

                              <span>Hello r/networking community!
 I&#x27;ve recently come across Netmaker, a networking solution that aims to simplify the creation and management of virtual networks using a decentralized approach. As someone interested in networking technologies, I&#x27;m intrigued by the concept and its potential benefits.
 Before diving in, I wanted to reach out to this knowledgeable community to gather insights and experiences related to implementing Netmaker. If you have any experience with Netmaker or have considered using it, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts on the following:
 1. How does Netmaker compare to traditional centralized networking solutions in terms of scalability, performance, and resilience?
 2. What are some notable use cases or scenarios where Netmaker shines the most?
 3. Are there any specific challenges or considerations to keep in mind when implementing Netmaker, especially in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment?
 4. What are your experiences with the security features provided by Netmaker, particularly in terms of data privacy and integrity?
 5. Have you found Netmaker&#x27;s documentation and community support resources to be helpful during your implementation journey? 
 I&#x27;m eager to learn from your expertise and insights on Netmaker. Feel free to share any tips, best practices, or real-world examples that can shed light on its capabilities. Thank you in advance for your valuable contributions!
 Note: As a disclaimer, I am not affiliated with the Netmaker team and I&#x27;m solely interested in gathering community insights and experiences.
 Looking forward to an engaging discussion!

I believe the n9kv images are available for free but couldn&#x27;t figure out if that is possible. I see SR-OS is possible but images are not available without a license. Any help is appreciated please.

The company has +- 40 square feet (+- 3630 square meter) and there&#x27;s 7 routers/access points badly distributed (and sadly most of &#x27;em can&#x27;t be moved). Many departments kinda suffer from this bad distribution (and their devices also sucks, many smartphones don&#x27;t even support 5GHz making my job harder).
 For many months employers were dealing with this issue and ofc they complain a lot about it, heard one today, as expected, and an &quot;idea&quot; came in my mind, what If we use their PCs to route to their phone…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I have endlessly browsed Reddit and other sites for advice or ideas on how to move forward with my current situation. But I figured the best course may be to ask flat out for advice 
 I started a Network Admin position recently, there is one other member on that team that was already there. The company I am working for is a rather large industrious company. They run 24/7 and hate stopping for maintenance, patching, etc. Because of this many of the IDFs and the MDF (for at least a couple of the locations) are a mess. Spaghetti everywhere, no labels, etc. the only reason it runs is tribal knowledge, nothing written or documented in any sense. I am tasked with documenting everything, organizing it, re doing any problem cabinets, and most important of all HAVING LITTLE TO NO DOWN TIME. I realize that there will be some necessary and will break that ice to the company. I just am curious if anyone has any advice for getting cables properly lengthen and swapped to new devices, centrally organizing everything, and just general cleanup? TIA
 Tl;dr: I started a network job, company hates downtime, all the cabinets are a mess and unlabeled, and my job is to clean it up

                              <span>I am having some issues locating information on how to enable LLDP/CDP on unifi USW series switches so we can connect the equipment with our SNMP management tool Auvik. Auvik can see the device but without LLDP/CDP we cannot identify what devices are connected.
 Does anyone know if USW supports LLDP/CDP? Does any line of switches from Ubiquity support LLDP/CDP

 but when i ping 1.2.3.4 directly, it is unsuccessful
 whats the explanation?
 is there something the dns server is providing other than the IP address for the name?
 is it something in the host file on the local machine maybe?
 What security mechanism is this? 
 any suggestions?

 If I wanted to plug a 10GB multimode SFP into a 1GB network module on a Cisco 3650, would I be able to get network connectivity. 
 Thanks

                              <span>My security team asked me to look for a way to prevent users from interacting with the various AI style chatbots you see on webpages. Not chatgpt per se, but even the pop up chat bots that answer basic questions and have been around for years.
 My firewall vendor does not have any application controls, botnet detection, DLP etc that could target this web traffic, and official response from them is that it is not on the radar.
 -I might be able to discover some associated IPs and block them, but very manual and not robust.
 -May be able to find a user-agent string in http request to block. Maybe more success here but the same draw backs really.
 ​
 If you can think of any feasible approach I would love to hear it. Thanks!

                              <span>We’ve run into a curious issue where it seems a Cisco stack’s PVST (could be PVST+, will confirm) BPDUs are finding their way through an RSTP topology made up of Dell S4048 switches connected via 802.1Q trunks and hitting the upstream provider’s Ethernet access port. 
 The upstream provider’s switch turns their port to blocking mode due to receiving a PVST(+) BPDU on a non-802.1Q trunk, or so I’m told by the ISP. When we disconnect the Cisco stack from the topology, the upstream ISP’s MAC addresses appear on the network a few seconds later.
 Links go:
 Cisco stack (dot1q Po6) -&gt; Dell S4048 pair in VLT (dot1q Po27) -&gt; Dell S4048 pair in VLT (separate domain) (vlan 998 access) -&gt; upstream provider switches.
 The Dell switches use RSTP, PVST+ is not enabled on them.
 Is it possible for the PVST+ BPDUs from the Cisco to be passing through the dot1q links (Cisco to Dell to Dell) and then finding their way to the upstream ISP’s switchports which triggers their BPDU protections? I’ve read an article (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/24063-pvid-inconsistency-24063.html) which talks about PVID inconsistency.
 The ISP side has two L2 lines and spanning tree is used to control which line is used.

                              <span>We’re a Silver-Peak customer and have been for three years. I have friends that work sales for Silver-Peak, Cloud Genix and Velocloud. All have shared with me that ever since the cert issue a month back on the Vedges which caused client sites to go dark forcing them to upgrade all of their Vedges they have seen a big jump in potential clients reaching out to do a proof of concept for immediate replacement. My thought is this is possibly driven by upper management (business side), we as engineers sometimes underestimate the financial impact to a business in an event of an issue such as this. If your a VEdge customer what has been your managements direction after this issue if you were impacted?

                              <span>Hello All, I was wondering if anyone could give me tips on adding redundancy to our current network. We currently have an Active/Passive Fortigate cluster in place, however, below the Active/Passive cluster is our core switch which is a single point of failure. My goal is to make the core redundant, I was thinking of purchasing two Aruba 3810M&#x27;s and stacking them via backplane, however, I have also thought of just not stacking them. Please see my concerns below and feel free to share your opinions.

 ​
  
I understand that stacking at the core isn&#x27;t the greatest idea, because of the shared control plane, however, we aren&#x27;t a 24/7 facility, however, I do like the sounds of being able to update the core switch and not having to worry about the network going down.
 Reguardless if I stack or don&#x27;t stack the L3 switches, will I need LACP to go from the Firewall to my L3 core switches?
 What&#x27;s the added complexity with not stacking the switches? I believe that stacking the core switches and making one logical switch reduces config complexity, right?
  
​
 What do you guys think, should I stack at the core or keep the L3 switches separate? What protocols/technology would you put in place to achieve this? 
 ​
 Thanks for reading my post, I am looking forward to everyone&#x27;s feedback from the community!

 I have solarwinds network toolset installed (just installed today) on a windows server and our requirement is to monitor bandwidth on our edge routers and send email alerts when it goes beyond a certain threshold, can this tool do the job? I see a bandwidth gauges but don&#x27;t know if this tool can then send alerts via email, will have to play around a bit. I am used to the solarwinds NPM tool and I know that you can do bandwidth monitoring and stuff like that on this tool so if solarwinds toolset turns out not to be the tool we want then will have to buy the solarwinds NPM.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi, long story short i&#x27;m studying POE power delivery so I can use it on custom designed networked electronic devices but I have a few doubts on what to expect from comercial PSEs and I figured this would probably be the best place to ask.
 My main doubts are understanding the default settings and user-changeable options when dealing with off-the-shelf PSEs.
 Since I don&#x27;t need 1gb I&#x27;m just focusing on 100base.
 As Alternative A and Alternative B aren&#x27;t part of the POE negotiation PSE&#x27;s can just be compatible with one of them but devices are probably recommended to be compatible with both? Or is it easy to find/set what wiring scheme the PSE is set to?
 And regarding Passive POE, disregarding injectors, are they all set to on by default? It seems possible to turn off/on by the user in some models/brands?
 Thank you.
 Edit: Oh, one more thing. Haven&#x27;t really dealt with POE devices yet but from my understanding of the thing, the POE controller needs power for the POE negotiation before power is made available through the ethernet connection right? Do you guys happen to know where the chip usually gets it&#x27;s power from when a purely POE powered device is first hooked up? Small internal rechargeable battery or something of the sort?

                              <span>The Global Virtual Private Network (VPN) Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 17% during the forecast period, i.e., 2023-28. The growth of the market is projected to be driven mainly by the ever-rising concerns across enterprises over the security of the data being transferred over a public internet connection, the mounting number of cyberattacks.

                              <span>TLDR; Simulating a L2 Leaf Spine NW in GNS3 in preparation for a network re-architecture at work. The two spine switches seem to both forward any routed traffic. Can&#x27;t figure out why, and was curious if anyone here encountered this before or know if its possibly a problem with GNS3 and wouldn&#x27;t happen on real devices?
 More detail:
 Small network I am currently simulating in GNS3 to learn more about how to implement L2LS consists of 2 spine switches (VLT Pair), 1 standalone leaf switch, and 2 leaf switches that are a VLT pair. OOBM switch in place for VLT backuo links
 I have 2 VLANS i am using to test routing. On each leaf switch I have two docker containers connected to it on each vlan. I am not yet testing any kind of VLT port channel from leaf switches to &quot;server&quot; just single connections for now.
 LEAF1-P1 -&gt; SPINE1-P1 LEAF1-P2 -&gt; SPINE2-P1
 LEAF2-P1 -&gt; SPINE1-P2 LEAF2-P2 -&gt; SPINE2-P2 LEAF3-P1 -&gt; SPINE1-P3 LEAF3-P2 -&gt; SPINE2-P3
 SPINEX-P1 are in VLT-PC1 SPINEX-P2/3 are in VLT-PC2 LEAF2/3-P1/2 are in VLT-PC2
 VRRP setup on SPINEs with virtip 192.168.X.1
 On Leaf1 I have a docker container with IP 192.168.2.50 trying to ping the docker container on LEAF2 with IP 192.168.4.51
 When that happens I get 3 duplicate responses.
 Basically what is happening is that SPINE1 (the main VLT/VRRP) gets the packet to be forwarded from VLAN 2 to VLAN4, and routes it appropriately. SPINE1 then sends that packet over VLTi to SPINE2, and then SPINE2 ALSO routes and forwards that packet. So the 192.168.4.51 gets 2x ping request. THEN, the same kind of doubling occurs on the response back ending uo with 4 responses sent to 192.168.2.50.
 Has Anyone seen this before? Is this expected behavior and I am messing up by trying to do L3 routing in a L2LS Network? Im basically the only networking person on my program, so sadly I do not have any way to bounce ideas off a true netwrok engineer other than going to the internet

                              <span>Hi all!
 We&#x27;ve just installed 2 Firebox T80 in HA and since 3 Internet connections arrives in VLANs and only 1 with physical cables (the router is right there), it would be easier for me to use VLANs inside the firewall too instead of transform them in physical cables in the switches (double because the firewalls are 2).
 It&#x27;s been suggested to me that it&#x27;s better for the Internet lines to be connected as physical ports instead of VLAN, but is that true? What are the cons in using VLANs (beside the limit of 1Gbps that I wish I could saturate with the Internet lines!)?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone
 I&#x27;ve just unboxed some new N9K-C93180YC-FX3 V01 and N9K-C93108TC-FX3P V03. The plan is to use the 180 as parent switches and the 108 as fex (software fex mode). The thing is, i just can&#x27;t get these things to run and can&#x27;t find anything related to my problem with cisco documentations etc.
 The switches are running a newer software release than required per fex compatibility matrix.
 The 108 are configured in software FEX mode as per cisco documentation.
 switch(config)# write erase
 switch(config)# no boot nxos
 switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config
 switch(config)# boot fex
 switch(config)# reload
 ​
 The 180 parent switch is configured as follows:
 switch(config)# install feature-set fex
 switch(config)# feature-set fex
 switch(config)# interface port-channel 113
 switch(config-if)# switchport
 switch(config-if)# switchport mode fex-fabric
 switch(config-if)# fex associate 113
 switch(config-if)# no shut
 -----------------------------------------------------
 switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/49,ethernet 1/50
 switch(config-if)# switchport
 switch(config-if)# switchport mode fex-fabric
 switch(config-if)# fex associate 113
 switch(config-if)# channel-group 113
 switch(config-if)# no shutdown
 switch(config-if)# exit
 The fex is just not coming up, the interfaces stay on not connected states (Connected via port eth1/49 to 1/49, 1/50 to 1/50 using QSFP-100G-CU5M DAC Cable) . Has anyone any ideas what might be causing this?

 Is it mainly a cost thing?

                              <span>Hi All,
 So I&#x27;m hitting an issue. I&#x27;ve created a hub and spoke custom centralised route policy matching a spoke site list with two spoke sites and adding the next hop as the hub TLOC.. but on the spoke sites they are not learning other spoke routes still...only the hub hosted routes. We are also using dia at the spoke sites so as it&#x27;s not learning other spoke routes it&#x27;s taking the dia route.
 TIA

                              <span>We work with an msp who gives us access to their hosted unifi controller. This msp uses the controller for several clients of theirs and occasionally I will see devices available for adoption come across on my site. Our business has our own site, we can only see and manage our own devices, no other clients. 
 The other day I was trying to add a new ap and another client was obviously doing the same thing. They ended up adopting my AP and it started broadcasting their wifi network. 
 It got me thinking is this normal or is our msp missing something with their controller config.

                              <span>We have a grandstream VOIP system we swapped for a previously working nortel system. One segment is shared by another vendor/entity. They have cisco 2900 switches. Durring business hours, every 4 or so minutes all devices on the phone vlan (10) drop all traffic for about 10 seconds then come back. All the computers on the default network plugged into the PC side of the phones stay up and work fine. 
 Our down stream device is a UNIFI 24 POE with VLAN 10. Tested both as a trunk and an access port both have the same result. Every 4 minutes all vlan traffic drops. 
 ​
 Troubleshooting has been limited. We have no access to the cisco equipment so i&#x27;m looking for suggestions to have them look for or even us. 
 Tested so far. We added a UNIFI switch directly in their cabinet. (to eliminate the 168ft CAT 6 run). No ports ever drop on anyone&#x27;s equipment.
 We have constant pings going to all phones and changed that to 4096 packet size to see if it was exhausting some sort of buffer. That didn&#x27;t change the frequency of the drops at all. 
 That&#x27;s pretty much it. The other guys have just swapped from trunked traffic to access port traffic. They have no idea what is really happening on their side.

Any features that are a must that you enable? DNS? DHCP? Etc? Anyone in Cisco world using DNAC to PnP join and deploy out your config template?

                              <span>Not sure if anyone can help with this. I have limited experience with networking. 
 I have a 100ft Cat6 cable with Neutrik Ethercon ends. Im using it for live video production. My system limits me to using 180ft of cable or less. Which a 100ft cable should be just fine for. However these cables are not working.
 When I test the cables with my Klein Scout Pro 3 it tells me the cables are 197-200 ft long. I know for a fact they are 100. I suspect this has something to do with my signal issue. What could be causing this?

                              <span>Hi y&#x27;all! 
 I&#x27;m changing the networking components at a nonprofit I work for. Their current set-up includes 3 netgear nighthawk routers (one per building) and those are connected to unmanaged gigabit switches (also from netgear) and one main Dell switch from like 2008. 
 They have unmanaged switches everywhere since the main building was built back in the 50&#x27;s. None of the cabling has labels and its basically a sh*tshow.
 Anyways, I&#x27;m trying to replace everything and basically start brand new. I&#x27;m looking for recommendations on routers and switches. Right now, we have a nighthawk RAX70 router in the main building and that connects two outerbuildings, one with a nighthawk AC1900 &amp; the other with netgear r6120 acting as AP&#x27;s. 
 What are the things I should take into consideration when looking for new routers and managed switches? I know I need gigabit ports. We have about 50 users spread out in these buildings that require reliable connection. I was looking into the Cisco router firewall plus gx50, but this does require a subscription. Also the Cisco 1000 series for the switches.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in the field for a number of years at this point, and I&#x27;ve noticed that without fail in mailing lists, there&#x27;s always a snarky comment or 10 whenever QUIC is discussed/debugged. To me, it seems more than general aversion to new technologies, even though it overall seems better than using TCP in most applications. Is it just part of the big tech hate?
 As someone who works a lot with traffic optimization over the public internet, I have found using QUIC to be immensely more useful to me than dealing with pure UDP or *shudder* TCP.

                              <span>I think this switch is gaslighting me.

 The switch is on .1 and the firewall/router is at .252 for both of the subnets. The firewall/router and AP are both FortiNet.
 Port 48 is my uplink, port 46 is my AP.
 AP is currently broadcasting the guest SSID on VLAN 124 and the corp SSID on VLAN 0 (to avoid double tagging).
 Data SSID works great, but I can&#x27;t get DHCP on the Guest SSID and I&#x27;m just flabbergasted. The firewall never even sees the request.
 Does anyone have ANY clue?

                              <span>What do you recommend for out of band serial console servers with LTE built it and why?
 The digi product line looks to be low cost and commerical. $165 for a 1 port console server with LTE built in. As does a 4 port for under $500 new. https://www.digi.com/products/networking/infrastructure-management/console-servers 
 Is there anything else even at or in this price range?

                              <span>After a lot of troubleshooting, I figured out our Catalyst 9500 is dropping DHCP helper packets, causing clients obviously to fail. This happens cross vlan, and even cross VRF - so on the whole router. We have isolated and can recreate and verify that the reason is a HDMI-to-IP AV device that is using broadcast. We can through inspection of the COPP control plane policy commands see that the router is dropping BROADCAST (Policier Queue 0) packets.
 I have to say I am a bit surprised to see the 9500 has default only 750pps rate limit for broadcast globally. How are people handling this and making sure bugged traffic, DoS or even just AVoIP devices doesn&#x27;t stop DHCP relay from working &quot;globally&quot;?
 The traffic is not DHCP traffic, it&#x27;s UDP 192.168.0.1-&gt;192.168.0.99, but the L2 destination is ffffff-ffffff. And port is not 67/68. I&#x27;m struggling to understand why the Cisco would even queue these packets for CPU handling?
 Anyway, I know I can rate limit the specific client and what not, but I want to know what is best practice for single users like this not killing a several 1000-user network.. Seems like a bad design on the Npu-&gt;cpu from Cisco&#x27;s side?

                              <span>Hello everyone! Just wanted to see if anyone else has ran into anything like this and what the solution was. Like the title says, we are trying to establish a 10gb link to another site via our ISP. The issue that we have run into is, our 10gb link is active and working, however we are only able to pass 2gb of traffic because all traffic going to the handoff device is coming from a single source mac address. Since it appears to be one source device, our ISPs link policing is forcing a 2gb flow limit. Would the best way forward be to add some sort of load balancer between devices that splits the single flow from the our device into 5 individual flows so that we can appropriately take advantage of the 2gb flow limit? At a loss here.

                              <span>Hi guys. I’m using now 255.255.254.0 as new subnet mask @ my office. So if i’m not wrong i’m going from ex. 10.0.0.1-254 and 10.0.1.1-254
 The question is:
 Client 10.0.0.5 is going to ping 10.0.1.17 for example?
 Smb protocol will act same way? I will able to open a folder 10.0.1.5/folder from 10.0.0.8?
 Sorry if i was not clear enough, trying to learn.

                              <span>Sorry, not sorry for the clickbaity title.
 But IMO after I had an opportunity to truly digest Service Mesh, I’ve always felt it to be similar to traditional VPN technologies.
 Folks may disagree here but hear me out for a second.
 Today’s set of VPN tech is plentiful, we have IPSec, wireguard, overlays like Geneve, and other proprietary solutions that connect two disconnected networks. But from Layer 3 (4) and below. 
 So service mesh enters the chat and addresses connectivity but at L7/HTTP. Tunnelling exists through mTLS, and Istio/Linkerd have their way of making this possible. Side-car proxies act as routers on behalf of containers pods and terminate at another side-car
 But what else does a service mesh do? - rate limit (qos) - traffic shift - load balance - filter by http request type - give us tracing and observability thanks to b3-header info (L7 traceroute) 
 Of course there still needs to exist a TCP (and below) layer for all of this to happen…
 And DNS.
 So my two questions: 1. Why am I not seeing more Networking Engineers embrace the likes of Istio/Linkerd? (Maybe I’m in some echo chamber)
  
How do you all feel about Service Mesh?

                              <span>Trying to figure out how much work it would be to use something like PowerAutomate to pull data from maintenance notifications, current/future, from our various commercial circuit providers into something more human readable, and useful. Usual suspects, Lumen, Zayo, ATT, Sprint(tmobile) Comcast...
 Would like to build something into a list and then down the road, automate Solarwinds maintenance status of circuits based on reported circuit providers maintenances with SWIS API. They ask every quarter to drive down ticket volume/noise/MTTR.
 Just as typing this, a Zayo postponement came in, reminding me how complicated this may be.

 I&#x27;m a networking guy (Cisco and Juniper mainly), but never in my 10+ years have I had to deal with multicast. I have a Windows 10 device that I need to have one of its interfaces join a multicast group in order to see SAP video streams in VLC, and I am at a complete loss. 
 Multicast IP: 224.2.127.254
 Interface name: Cameras P1P2
 Interface IP: 192.168.111.11 
 I&#x27;ve been trying the following command lines, and they are all failing:
 netsh interface ip add v4multicastaddress &quot;Cameras P1P2&quot; 224.2.127.254
 netsh interface ip add v4multicast &quot;Cameras P1P2&quot; 224.2.127.254 
 The commands are failing after &quot;netsh interface ip add&quot;, with Windows telling me the only available commands that follow are: address, dnsservers, excludedportrange, neighbors, route, and winsservers. This has been stumping me for days, and hoping to get an idea of where to go next.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I heard good stuff about Backbox, but I can&#x27;t find any info an pricing on their website. And I don&#x27;t want to contact them or get a trial or what ever. I can&#x27;t stand another sales mail from another vendor. 
 How does the licensing work? What are the costs? Could we use it for many different switches/routers that are changing constantly? (that means, always other boxes). 
 Would be really great if someone could give me an inside if backbox could be an option.

                              <span>So how do you guys have your solar winds setup? Planning to install solar winds on a VM in Cisco ucs and what vlan should I put that under? Just create a separate vlan for this and then make sure that this vlan is present on all uplinks of all switches/routers? 
 We would not want to use a server vlan (where we have other servers) for solar winds in the ucs right? So it would need a different vlan? To keep it isolated?
 Thank you

                              <span>Hello, we have a problem with the correct NAT of traffic in this case - Wireguard client VPN connection to networks reachable behind the IPSecVPN tunnel. 
 The 172.16.0.0/24 network is the client VPN address. It connects to a VPN server that has access to local VLANs 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.10.0/24 - this traffic is carried out correctly. However, the Wireguard server itself also has an IPSec tunnel set up to the 10.168.106.0/24 network and traffic from 172.16.0.0/24 to this network does not work.
 In the second phase of IPSec there is no client VPN class - 172.16.0.0/24 and I can&#x27;t add it because I don&#x27;t have access to the other side, so it can be done through NAT addressing 172.16.0.0/24 to any address that exists in the second phase, e.g. 192.168 .10.250 if traffic is routed to 10.168.106.0/24.
 Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know which iptables rules I should use to implement this.

 By what I understood in an article I read, virtual MAC addresses start with 00:00:5E ..not sure this is correct. I guess any MAC address starting 00: is a virtual address?
 Any insight much appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, 
 is it possible to run power cables and shielded ethernet in the same conduit?
 having it separate would require an insane amount of work (destroying 150 meters of courtyard)
 I do have a conduit of 25 meters in which I&#x27;ve to run:
 -4 PoE++ cables
 -2 PoE+ cables
 -380V 10kW (grid to laboratory) - this could be 220V if needed
 -380V 20kW (pv system inverter to grid)
 At my disposal I do have those 2 ethernet cables
 https://eu.store.ui.com/eu/en/collections/unifi-accessory-tech-cable-box/products/unifi-outdoor-cable
 and
 https://www.assmann.com/product-pdf/4016032344063?PL&#x3D;en
 for what concerne power cables I still have to buy those and if there&#x27;s anything that would allow to run both in the same conduit I&#x27;ll get.
 which ethernet would be the most suitable? in case theres an ethernet cable better than mine let me know
 one end of the poe cables will be on cameras / switches while the other end will be on a server rack that is already grounded.
 patch panels in the rack is grounded, but most likely those cables will be directly terminated into unifi switch pro 24 poe.
 considering that the patchpanel is grounded and everything is made of metal is it fine to terminate those cables directly inside the switch?
 It would be ok to put another grounded patch panel in case its needed. I cant use tho the current one as it is already full
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey all, hoping to get some info from PA experts from this sub.
 I am trying to understand how the self-signed certs on the Palo Alto gateway are trusted by the Global Protect client when they authenticate and sign in.
 Basically with one of our fw setups, the gateway has a cert that is self signed by the firewall itself. When we connect to the VPN, there is no ssl warning prompt for the cert being untrusted. 
 I have checked that the root CA (also self signed by PA) is not present on the client machines. 
 If this is the case, is there any significance of having this cert setup correctly? Does the client just accept the cert no matter the details.
 I have noticed, that when we first add the portal IP, there is a warning only initially but no warning when connecting to the gateway.
 I tried looking at docs but couldn&#x27;t find what I was trying to understand here. Any info would be helpful.
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi All , im working on a problem where we have a pair of checkpoint firewalls in azure doing HA with load balancers , we followed this Architecture framework Network (checkpoint.com) .
 The problem is one of the Firewalls failed over (Cluster member didn&#x27;t actually fail) and the backend load-balancer is still pointing to the Primary firewall (now standby) which is breaking lots of our ssl connection&#x27;s understandably so
 We can just fail back however im wondering if its possible for the load balancers to detect HA state instead of probing if a member is alive

 ​
 Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this but having some issues with our Palo Alto&#x27;s. The PAN-DB cloud is connected, but all URLs are coming back as not-resolved.
 ​
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can troubleshoot this further?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>We have an IP range 103.180.31.0/24 provided to us by an IRR and the connectivity is provided by an ISP. The problem is that anything hosted on that IP range is not accessible outside of India. However, DNS works, IP will be resolved but the page won’t load. The browser gives request timed out error. I have checked in firewall there are no geo blocking policies enabled. Can someone tell me what’s wrong? Is there is a blocking from ISP side?
 P.S. everything works fine if anything hosted on that IP range is accessed from India.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Home lab, so I did this to myself.
 One Proxmox server 10.0.0.17:8006
 I built another Ubuntu server (not on Proxmox) and gave it the same IP. Oops, removed server (Off)
 Except now, Macbook with Firefox cannot reach 10.0.0.17:8006 even after reboot
 Mint laptop with Firefox - no problems, brings up management console. WHY???
 I&#x27;ll look past the jokes about the Macbook Air (I know...)
 I&#x27;ve tried clear cache, private window, nothing seems to work. It&#x27;s not OMG critical, but never seen this in all my years (Arp cache??) Looking for ideas. Thanks!
 Update EDIT: The answer was Arp cache!
 How on a MACbook Air? Interestingly, opening a TERMINAL and typing 
 &gt;arp -a
 does not show that IP address in the list.
 However: &gt;sudo arp -a -d
 cleared all entries, and now it works.
 If anyone else finds this problem, think of ARP similar to DNS:
 DNS will take a domain name (dell.com) and translate to an IP address.
 whereas ARP will take an IP address, and translate it to a MAC address on the local network.
 So: proxmox.domain.local &#x3D; 10.0.0.17
 and 10.0.0.17 &#x3D; e3:d4:ac:f4:39:0a
 And this ARP table on the MACBOOK had the incorrect MAC address.
 clearing the ARP cache with &gt;sudo arp -a -d
 cleared that table and let the MAC re-ask where that IP address was.
 Thanks to everyone for troubleshooting!

                              <span>My company requires all salaried and hourly employees to fill out time sheets. 
 How many of you salaried employees have to fill out timesheets to show all the work you did for day and account for all of your time during an 8 hour workday?
 When I questioned this, their excuse is &quot;to show how profitable we are as a company&quot;.
 This does not include any after hours work &quot; That just expected since we are IT&quot;. 
 We were just asked to now itemized everything we put in our ticketing system and put it into a separate &quot;time tracking&quot; application outside of our ticketing system. Here the thing we already track our time and document everything in our ticketing system. Why should we have to do this twice?
 Am I crazy to be getting upset about this or is this normal?

                              <span>Hi,
 I want to compare two CSV files - in case there is a match update the existing column with values &quot;X&quot; and create a new CSV file.
 Here my attempt ...
 $ht4 &#x3D; @{} Import-Csv &quot;PATH-TO-CSV-FILE\file1.csv&quot; | ForEach-Object { $ht4[$_.Value1] &#x3D; $_.Value1 } Import-Csv &quot;PATH-TO-CSV-FILE\file2.csv&quot; | Select-Object *, @{Name &#x3D; &#x27;Action&#x27;; Expression &#x3D; { If($_.Value1 -eq $ht4[$_.Value1]){ &#x27;X&#x27; } Else { } } } | Export-Csv -Path &quot;PATH-TO-CSV-FILE\file3.csv&quot; -NoTypeInformation 
  
file1.csv contains:
 column: Value1
 data: A B C etc...
  
-------------------------------
  
file2.csv contains:
 columns: Test1 Test2 Value1
 data: A B C etc...
  
Note: The column &quot;Action&quot; already exists in file2.csv | I need to update the existing column.

                              <span>TL;DR: longtime sysadmin leaving job due to disrespect from old school manager who should&#x27;ve retired 2 years ago. anyone else doing the same? (multi-campus higher ed w/ 700+ employees, 20k students) (probably whiny sh!tpost coming) 
 the story: 
 I have spent my adult life building my career at my current job and am leaving after a multi year decline in the quality of decision making and employee relations failures of the head of the IT department. 
 The last 4-6 years have been marked by terrible decision making, &quot;Do as i say not as i do&quot; behavior, unchecked absenteeism (the dept head is known across the college for never being in the office, we don&#x27;t allow work from home anymore) 
 one case study: He has assigned the sysadmin/netadmin team not only answer the helpdesk tech phone calls (one person per day every day) but the main number for the institution under the guise of being unable to staff the Service Desk (despite never even trying to hire and cutting hours of those we already employ) when we were told we were going to fill in we were given reasoning that the SC was getting blasted with calls and voicemails and we were a temporary stop gap. that was 6 months ago. there have never been reports produced with the actual metrics or progress made. no positions for the entry level job have ever been posted and now 6 months of this have gone by with little to no sign of it ending. HR is impotent as they&#x27;ve said they don&#x27;t want this happening but it continues. the VP above has made promises to &#x27;put a stop to it&#x27; yet it continues. 
 this is but one in a litany of examples of this toxic and abusive behavior, and an opportunity came up, so i took it. might recruit the rest of my team to come along... JB? KV? MG? (i know you will see this)

                              <span>I am trying to set a windows theme on login for all users, I have tried GPO and it has been a mixed bag on it being reliable. I have a working batch file in the common startup that fires:
 u/echo off
 start &quot;&quot; &quot;C:\Windows\Theme\ponsys.deskthemepack&quot; &amp; timeout /t 3 &amp; taskkill /im &quot;systemsettings.exe&quot; /f
 ​
 Works great except the cmd prompt pops up and is visible to the user, I have heard about running powershell scripts with the hidden window flag but I dont know powershell well at all. Does anyone have some suggestions on an avenue for this. We are using individual machines so I dont have a way to manage these pcs but at an individual level hence no domain based GP. Thanks!

                              <span>SOLVED: I have seen the light, and it is a re-image. Thank you!
 I&#x27;m repurposing some laptops, so that they can be used by another user.
 First one: I log in as a local admin. I disconnect the computer from Azure Active Directory. But I still see the former user&#x27;s files in C:\Users\HerUsername.
 I proceed to manually delete that directory, so that the next user won&#x27;t see them (yes, they&#x27;ll be a local admin, and yes, we will discuss that, but in a later post!).
 After those files are deleted, User comes to me and says all of her documents just disappeared. And two other users tell me that their Sharepoint library&#x27;s files have disappeared.
 After a mild panic attack, I restored everything, except files that had been modified that day (Onedrive only restored up until last night&#x27;s files).
 So, I gather that:
 Even after disconnecting from Azure, files that were synced to a computer are still there, AND if I manually delete them, they get deleted everywhere??
 Is this by design? If so, how can I un-design it?
 How am I supposed to transfer a laptop to a different user (again, for now, they&#x27;re both local admins)?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Management has engaged a MSP to provide a secondary backup of our NAS. We already do the 3-2-1 backup strategy in house but I have no problems with another layer of backup if it&#x27;s not my money. However, the MSP is forcing us to buy 100 seats of Sophos because they claim it&#x27;s unsafe to backup and restore any data without it. The stuff that will be backed up resides on a Synology NAS available on the LAN via SMB only. We currently use Huntress and Defender on our PCs. 
 I told them OK if you think Sophos is better than our current EDR that&#x27;s fine, we can install it on the one PC that will be used to administer the MSPs backup and they can scan the NAS share. They said no we need Sophos on all the PCs or they will not agree to backup stuff via Cloudberry. I told them I don&#x27;t agree with this approach and to get approval from the people signing the checks. 
 I would like any opinions regarding the validity of their claims that 100 Sophos licenses are needed to make a Cloudberry backup of a NAS &quot;safe&quot; despite having already having Huntress and offering them 1 PC with Sophos to scan the SMB share.

                              <span>Does anyone else get phone calls from vendors trying to tell you about their latest solution? I mean, I used to be a consultant, I get it. But I now for the Federal government, The annoying part is that when I try to explain that I don&#x27;t make those decisions they either still want to talk to me or want me tell them who to contact.
 I have no idea who they would contact, and when I tell them that they insist on getting my supervisor&#x27;s name, who doesn&#x27;t make that choice either. I&#x27;m a lowly sysadmin in the mountains of Colorado, these decisions are made by someone in Washington, DC, way above my paygrade.
 My contact details are public and it&#x27;s easy to tell that I work for the Feds, anyone with half a brain should realize that they don&#x27;t do vendor and product selection in the manner.
 Excuse the rant but it&#x27;s getting ridiculous, at least the emails are easy to block.

 ​
 The following needs to be done on the PC&#x27;s:
 - Upgrade from W11 to W11Pro
 - Install specific non microsoft programs
 - setup Microsoft Account for specific User

 Sorry if this is a noob question. I just have zero experience in this regard and need to find a way to do it. I can probably run a lot of it in Powershell, but a solution for everything in one single way would be amazing. What do you think?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Hi all, Do any of you have a clear DR plan for what to do if an admin account in your Azure tenant is compromised?
 As I see it, a single forgotten service account could result in all other admins passwords&#x27; changed, and losing access to everything in Azure/M365.
 In my on-premises environment, if I have a set of backup tapes for all my data sitting on a shelf, I can (theoretically) always wipe all devices to bare metal and have everything restored, including identities, in the time it takes to copy the data. Cloud is not so simple. * Azure AD itself can&#x27;t be restored, at least not with the same identities. If you lose control of a tenant, any identities are gone. And if you use Azure AD login and Intune with Bitlocker, your devices are all now wiped as well. Any configuration that depends on application configurations or managed identities needs to be rebuilt. Even UPNs wouldn&#x27;t work, since you can&#x27;t add the same domain onto a new tenant. * VMs in Azure can be backed up by any backup agent, but what about PaaS? If you&#x27;re relying on Azure Backup/ Site Recovery, you just lost that too. Are there any good options for backing up files or blobs in Azure storage accounts? What about databases? Or Azure Key Vault? Azure Automation? * If you&#x27;re using Azure services, you should be storing all your environment configuration in a code repository. But is it really all there? Have you tested a rebuild? And if you&#x27;re using a cloud repository and logging in with Azure AD SSO, I have some bad news for you..... * For Office 365 data, much of it can be backed up, but can it be restored in a new tenant? Even tenant-to-tenant migrations with access to both tenants are spotty. In a new tenant, any identities are gone, and any permissions or groups would need to be rebuilt.
 Is there any product out there that claims to be able to restore your entire Azure estate, or should I just throw my hands up and hope it doesn&#x27;t happen?

                              <span>We have a MySQL database that&#x27;s been happily accessed via T1 lines for years without issue. Now the internet provider has eliminated those lines and we are forced to rely on a Comcast cable connection (connecting via static ip).
 This works for most people, until it doesn&#x27;t. Randomly (it seems) a remote user will not be able to connect. This has nothing to do with the number of connections (we only have like 10 users at any given time). Unfortunately this is the only internet access available in our area.
 I&#x27;m going to continue troubleshooting but just wondering:
  
Do other folks use Comcast/cable provider modem/routers to access SQL dbs and do they generally work?
 Would buying a newer, better modem/router be advisable?
  
Any input appreciated.

                              <span>We use Mimecast for a spam filter and whatnot and our CEO received an email from &quot;our IT department&quot; saying that his password was about to expire and he should scan the QR code to confirm and keep using the password. The entire email almost looks like one big picture of text and a QR code so I am not sure if Mimecast could read the impersonation attempt. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations on how to block emails like this? We have all of the standard policies configured, but I think this one got through because it is an image with a URL attached to it?
 Any tips are appreciated.
 Thank you!

 Not sure why only the E3 users (which do have audio conferencing) don&#x27;t have it

 However if users have been asked to set up MFA via myaccount.microsoft.com, which control panel are you able to see this from?

 Error user sees: &quot; We tried to update your password, but couldn&#x27;t sync with your workplace because of a network problem. Try again in a few minutes. If it still doesn&#x27;t work, contact your admin and provide the detailed error information. &quot;
 The AD Connect Server is Server 2022 with AD Connect version 2.1.20.0
 On the AD Connect server, errors in the application log has many of these errors:
 Event 612: Directory Synchronization
 Failed to initialize synchronization context for domain: . It will be retried in the next password hash synchronization cycle. Details:
 System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapException: The supplied credential is invalid.
 at System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapConnection.BindHelper(NetworkCredential newCredential, Boolean needSetCredential)
 Event 6001: ADSync
 The management agent &quot;&quot; failed on run profile &quot;Delta Import&quot; because a connection could not be established to the server.
 So, I see it says the supplied credential is invalid, but what credential?
 I saw a blog post that said it could be related to TLS 1.2 and to add SchUseStrongCrypto key in the registry with a value of 1. I did that and rebooted, but the issue remains.
 What else can cause this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 The scenario is: You’re upgrading the domain controller to a newer version of Windows Server for some new infrastructure requirements. All workstations are Windows. No Azure AD in place.
 The problem is: Some end users that will need to be migrated to the new domain work remotely (not down the street remotely, but sometimes a few states away remotely). These users connect to resources over VPN, but the VPN authentication is tied to the domain controller that is going to be decommissioned.
 At some point during the migration the authentication of VPN is going to have to be redirected to the new domain controller. What I’m trying to nail down is what’s the best way/best sequence of steps to get all the devices on the new domain with the wrinkle of VPN being tied to the old one?
 There’s only about 15 or so people I’m dealing with, not hundreds or thousands. So even if the process is a little tedious, that’s okay. One thing I thought about is just switching the VPN (temporarily) to authenticate using some other method besides VPN before the migration starts, but I’m trying to see what all my options are.
 TLDR: upgrading/replacing domain controller, some users are offsite so their devices would be joined over VPN, but VPN auth is tied to old domain/domain that is going away. Need to figure out optimal way to do the migration.
 Any thoughts or resources would be appreciated?

                              <span>I am looking for a tool that will allow me to install on a users computer and copy data to their home directories on a schedule. 
 A little background, we do use one drive and sync data but I am looking for something that is a bit more transparent for me. I have run into issues in the past where that is setup in One Drive but it hasn&#x27;t run in months. Also, we do use a VPN connection as well so people can access the data from the servers and drives remotely. 
 The issue I have is we are a Forestry Management company and the guys are literally out in the woods on a daily basis. There is no cell services or anything while they are in the woods. The need data on their computers when they are working out there and I want to find a way to make sure the data is being backed up. 
 I had an incident where I wiped and reloaded a computer and come to find out the user has data on the root of the C drive. I have since made sure he can&#x27;t put data there but I have a feeling other users are doing the same thing because my predecessor gave users full admin access to their computers. 
 Has anyone found a software that has some type of console that will allow me to monitor when the last time data was copied or synced? Or any other suggestions?

 In Microsoft defender for Cloud there&#x27;s a recommendation: Endpoint protection should be installed on machinesThe servers do not show up in the Device inventory of Microsoft defender as well.So clearly, Endpoint protection is not installed on the servers.
 I started the on-boarding process about an hour of 7 ago, So I&#x27;m getting a bit worried.Is there a way to enforce the installation of Endpoint protection on the servers?Thanks! 
 Edit: The servers are Connected in Azure ARC, In Microsoft Defender for Cloud at the Environment settings, I have enabled Plan2

                              <span>The task scheduler in window server 2012 R2 is to run a script to copy or transfer files from local to a remote server. It needs to use a non-interactive user account to the script on the local. The non-interactive user account has been given an administrator privileges and the setting in the local security policy such as “log on as a service” and “replace a process level token”. I have created both non-interactive user account in the local and remote server. 
 How do configure so that the script can perform and run successfully?

                              <span>I have always used the EN-GB iso from MS back when creating an image for 1802 and 20H2. We have finally got around to updating the image but I cannot find the iso. All our SCCM wsus updates/feature updates and software are using the en-gb versions of everything.
 Have I just missed something? The only version I can find to download is the evaluation one. In our volume licence it only offers EN-US :(

                              <span>Hello :)
 we are working on Azure Virtual Desktop with Windows 10 21H2 19044.2965.
 A few weeks ago, we installed an FSLogix Update and rebooted the server. 
 Since that day users complain about Errors in the Display of Text. For Example, there appears comma in a Name, or an &quot;E&quot; becomes a &quot;D&quot;. Digits change too, good to see in Windows File Explorer when you have multiple Files named File - 1, File - 2, File -3. If i hover up and down on them the digits change to their neighbour value.
 This happens only if i RDP into the RDS-Server. If i connect via Remote Control Software, even in User Support Session i can the original text, no errors.
 This could cause devastating consequences. But i am not sure how to troubleshoot this error.
 Did you expierience a Bug like this?
 We use RDP UDP Shortpath, i disabled it temporarily but that didnt help. I think it could be a problem with some kind of Compression happening via RDP. But why after FSLogix Update..
 Should i contact Microsoft Azure Support about that? What would your next steps be?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We currently utilize a VAR for our laptop fulfilments to field users. They do everything including print a Welcome Guide and put it in the box before shipping to the users. We execute about 5,000 deployments per year. We are looking to bring that function in-house. Among the considerations for us is how to make the best use of our physical office space when prepping 100s of laptops per month. I&#x27;d like for us to be able to &quot;gang&quot; all the laptops together in a dense physical arrangement and have access to the console via a KVM (keyboard video monitor) switch. 
 Is there a KVM that has dozens of ports that you may think about for this type of arrangement? Anyone in this subreddit doing anything similar and have ideas for efficiency?
 Thanks!
 JC

                              <span>Hi all, I have a cron job in Ubuntu that runs a speed test every hour and appends the result to a CSV. Each result is a new line in the CSV. I also would like to append the time (using ‘date’ command) but can’t figure out how to make it output to the same line in the CSV. 
 I currently use date &gt;&gt; file.csv &amp;&amp; speedtest -f csv &gt;&gt; file.csv
 That outputs the date on a separate line. I want the date on the same line as the soeedtest output. Also if the soeedtest fails to run I just want the date on the line. 
 Bonus: Can I also convert bytes per sec to Mbps before outputting the results to the CSV using just the shell, without resorting to something like Python?

 They can authenticate to computer with PIN and password but they are not authenticated in Radius. 
 When i try to login with a new user on the computer I receive the error that it lost trust.
 What can cause this issue and how can i check if the PIN is expired or not, because they expire at 60 days

                              <span>Hi All
 We have a HPE DL380 Gen 10 with a 3 year base warranty. It should include 9x5 support with NBD Onsite Support and parts. We now have a defective HDD on the server. The HDD is an original part from HPE. But HPE now claims that the HDD only has a 1-year warranty and the 3-year server warranty does not cover this.
 In the past this was never an issue.
 Even the PDF for ProLiant base warranty states that additional parts are covered by the server warranty.
 A complaint to HPE did not help either.
 I think we will switch to Lenovo or Dell in the future. Working with HPE got worse and worse over the past few years for small partners like us.

 is there any way in Intune to enroll a machine certificate (SCEP) only to those machines in a known good compliance state? Maybe even revoke it if it isn&#x27;t compliant anymore?
 Also: Is it possible to filter (or build a dynamic AAD group) for only compliant devices?
 Thanks! Much appreciated :)

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to know if you know a way to connect securely a vpn (like wireguard/ipsec which is layer 3 on the osi layer) before windows starts.
 Also, there would need to be a way to avoid connecting in case the connected network is already the &quot;target&quot; network (don&#x27;t need a vpn when you&#x27;re on the right network already, you only need it if you&#x27;re remote)
 Maybe that would require to install some kind of special very tiny &quot;operating system&quot; for that very purpose, all in command line which would execute the right instructions, anyhow I haven&#x27;t been able to find yet what and how.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello, recently we got a new regulation that requires to perform KYC to our customers, that means we must receive and confirm our customers ID picture.
 Right now, our customer service department is storing the ID&#x27;s in the customers ticket in a help desk platform, which I totally hate and I think it should never be stored like this..
 I mean, if someone gains malicious access to this platform or one of our employees decides to &quot;steal&quot; these documents, he will do it with no issues at all.
 I was wondering, should we maybe encrypt the received documents and store it encrypted? but then, how do I even achieve that? our customer service department will still need the ability to &quot;view&quot; and confirm the ID is valid, after they confirmed it&#x27;s valid, what do I do with the file? I probably want something automated that let&#x27;s the service agent the ability to view the file and I guess I can audit this to a log file.. then I also need a DLP solution..
 I would love to hear your thoughts about that and how you think I should work with customers personal documents &amp; store them.
 Thanks

                              <span>good morning,
 trying to find fastest 1:1 nat (stateless) for linux using a &quot;middle&quot; server between two lan, tried:
 - haproxy (tcp mode), ipvs, iptable (dnat and snat black magic), tc...seems all hit a wall and not be able to reach near wire-speed nat, any suggestion?
 thank you
 (ws01)  (middle box nat)  (srv01)
 ps:
 in L2 bridge the middle linux box could reach full wirespeed of 10Gbps with 40% cpu load.

                              <span>Im am suffering a password guess attack on my Synology NAS. Someone is repeatedly trying to access the default &quot;admin&quot; account. My case is specific to Synology but I believe the same applies for any system when an attacher managed to guess a username.
 I&#x27;m not worried about security, the account is not used and I set a random 20-chars password and MFA, but I am getting security alert email every 15 minutes from the system.
 What&#x27;s the best way to react to such a scenario? Every query is coming from a different IP address, I cannot manually ban enach and every one. I also cannot remove the default admin account, or change my static IP address.

                              <span>Hi there!
 Currently I am struggling with some weird behavior regarding windows permissions. The situation is as follows:
 We have a Windows Server, which serves as a small file-server. My user is part of the domain admins, which are part of the local administrators of the windows. There are multiple directories on the server and the local admininstrator group as well as the domain admins are permissioned on each folder and file.
 Now the issue: I am unable to change or create any file in those directories.
 It only works when I take ownership of file using my user. When I give ownership to Domain Admins or Local Admins it does not work again (And yes, my user is definitly member of the domain admins).
 Does anyone know why windows apparently can not handle groups on this server? For some reason it does no recognize that my user is member of the permissioned group.

 Microsoft recently added Windows Laps. Which made it possible to upload the local admin password to the Azure AD device object. Which is awesome.
 I have created a desktop app which will search up the device in azure that it&#x27;s executed on and grab the password and show it to the user (if the user has access to read the property)
 I&#x27;m now also trying to make this app available for - Lets call them &quot;power users&quot; which i want to be able to get the local admin password only on the devices that they are owner of, not all devices.
 So, what I&#x27;m trying to achieve is scoping/ the API/Custom role to only grant the &quot;power user&quot; access to read the Local admin password on devices that they own/are primary user of.
 has anyone any idea on how/if i can achieve this?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 as per title I would like enable these predefined rules with a GPO
 ​
 But only for the domain profile, I tried creating a custom rule with these service names
 But it doesn&#x27;t allow me to do that and just defaults to all programs. 
 Is there any other way to do that? Do you have any hints of what to look for?
 Any helps is greatly appreciated
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 small company and current sysadmin is letting me help a bit out with smaller stuff which is a lot of fun as I&#x27;m educating myself on the side. I&#x27;m trying to figure an issue out and usually my google is on point, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out where to start with the search. 
 We have multiple scan workstations on windows that need fast access to a NAS, producing thousands of folders with images on a daily basis. Current setup is old, not compliant with what we should have. Single user for all pcs that has domain admin and thus way too many rights for what that pc actually needs. But if I use a user without domain admin rights, the folder access speed to the NAS goes down dramatically to the point that a folder containing e.g. 80k subfolders doesn&#x27;t pull the list fast enough for our software to work, thus crashing the workflow. With domain admin the entire folder is listed in a second or two, without it takes minutes to list.
 I&#x27;m at a loss what exactly handles this kind of file access and thus far only found out that domain admin grants the access speed and it&#x27;s my goal to remove domain admin from that setup. Anyone kind enough to give me pointers where I could start looking?

                              <span>Hi guys!
 Got the opportunity to get 2x 3PAR 7200c and 2x M6720 Driveshelfs, each with 12x 2TB and 12x 4TB SAS drives for my homelab/mediastorage.
 To be honest: The data density to power usage ration is nothing for me with the current drives, but who knows...
 As far as i know there is no possibility to install something like TrueNAS on the Controllers, but please proof me wrong.
 Any ideas what i could do with them or should i just leave them where they are now?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 We have some Palo Alto Firewalls and we use the Pan-DB for URL filtering. Up until last week, it was working fine but now nearly all websites are showing as not-resolved. When I do a URL check on the Palo url check, they come back low risk, and with categories. 
 ​
 I have checked and the firewalls are connected to the cloud and license is valid.
 ​
 Does anyone have some suggestions on how I can resolve this?

                              <span>I’m doing some side hustling helping out a few companies with upgrading their tech/security stack in a few key areas. AV, VPN, etc. My go-to stack is Crowdstrike for EDR, Twingate for VPN, and maybe something like Cloudflare or NextDNS for web filtering + wrapping some services to get all this set up, integrated, etc.
 Problem is — every time I present the estimated cost of everything, it’s always sticker shock.
 I get that companies are more scrutinizing of budget these days and want to save money. But if you’re running a bunch of open source stuff that your cousin built, you’re saving some hard dollars but probably costing way more in cost of someone babysitting that rickety stack, security risk of something configured wrong, etc.
 Anyway, I’m clearly doing something wrong because it’s hit or miss on getting folks to agree.
 How do you guys present your “business case” for tech upgrades like this? Do you build spreadsheets with potential cost savings, time savings, etc to show some kind of estimated ROI? If so, any templates you’ve found useful?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read multiple similar posts on this topic in this subreddit, and you good folk provided some awesome help!
 Which is why I&#x27;m posting here as well.
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve set up the DMARC record for our new Google Workspace domain correctly.
 I followed Google&#x27;s DMARC documentation/guide precisely and added our DMARC record as follows in Cloudflare:
 https://snipboard.io/cCQTMY.jpg
 But mail-tester returns this result: https://snipboard.io/lZ8AHD.jpg
 How come the &quot;Message has a DKIM or DK signature, not necessarily valid&quot;?
 I followed what Google asked to the T. And yes I can see that the score deduction is only -0.1 but it still annoys me that the DMARC is potentially set up wrong.
 Also what does &quot;SPF: HELO does not publish an SPF Record&quot; mean? Again, I followed Google&#x27;s instructions to add SPF precisely.
 Any and all help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!!

                              <span>So, not sure which particular rock we were hiding under, but just received notification that MS was going to block MFA by SMS, and require the app to be installed to use MFA, and current SMS users would be prompted to install the MS app as of Jul 10. 
 Several of our clients do not provide company phones, and it&#x27;s going to be a hard sell for several users and at least a couple of owners to &quot;insist&quot; they install the MS App on their personal phone for using company email.... Is anyone else running into this wall? And if so, how are you handling it gently enough to mollify the user, while still installing unwanted software on their personal device? 
 And before we go down the road of &quot;Is it really that big of a deal?!?&quot;, two things: One, it&#x27;s the principle of the thing for several users, and two: it&#x27;s not like MS has a squeaky clean reputation for how they handle personal data, so telling the user &quot;No, it won&#x27;t get any information off your phone....&quot; won&#x27;t fly very high heheh.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on a Kubernetes team where we manage 2 different distributions of K8s. We started our switch to the new platform at least 2 years ago. At that time we announced our end of support for the old one, but our users wouldn&#x27;t move their apps. They have a ton of reasons, but it mainly comes around priorities and money. Since the original announcement, they&#x27;ve had 2 chances to setup their budget for the year to include the migration but many teams have just not bothered. We&#x27;ve gotten little to no support from our leadership even though we&#x27;ve been hit with a huge, multimillion dollar cost to keep extending support and licensing. They know we&#x27;re leaving and are stuck, so they can stick us on the way out.
 We&#x27;ve alerted everyone to the fact that we are no longer doing updates to the platform and any security vulnerabilities need to now be tagged against the teams who refuse to leave rather than ours. We&#x27;ve also notified everyone that support goes away at the end of this year, even though we&#x27;re already so far behind that we aren&#x27;t supported anyway.
 What else can we do? I&#x27;m expecting our leadership to expect a Hail Mary if there is a production impacting outage even though we&#x27;re ending up so far out of support it&#x27;ll be a nightmare to fix. But we&#x27;ve got some mission critical apps running there.
 Anyway... this is sort of a rant, sort of an actual question.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I work for a small/medium size company (about 200 employees) But there are only two of us on staff in the IT Department. The company recently green lit its new ERP project. We are switching from Microsoft GP and ASC WMS to Netsuite/DataNinja. The project does not kick off until September 1st. But they have asked us to put together a IT Project plan. This is the 1st time I am ever dealing with a project like this so I am not sure how or where to start. Can you guys give us an idea on how to go about putting together a project plan? Any advice or suggestions you could give us would be great. Right now we are planning on putting together a team using one person from each department and form a rollout team. But that is as far as we have gotten.

 Is this possible in teams?
 How do you handle users skipping the proper channels and reaching out directly to you?

                              <span>I assume this is not a problem that occurs in just IT, but it seems especially bad in this field.
 I posted a sysadmin job (local in person only sadly) and none of the people who have applied presented a decent resume. One of them literally had less than 10 words per job in their experience section. Not a single one mentioned scripting or automating. (yes, scripting experience is in the listing) One said &quot;installed firewalls and AV software&quot; What firewall!? Where!? What AV on what OS!? How many!?
 I can see some potential in a couple of the applicants, so i may extend an offer for interview, but is it socially acceptable to offer resume advice in an interview? I work for a small company and am not sifting through hundreds of applicants, but if i was i would 100% gloss over every one of these so far.

 Besides getting the M365 URLs/endpoints, would anyone know where to begin on the Meraki side?

 I&#x27;ve set the Encrypted password history size to 4, how do I see the history?
 I use the admin center and can can only see one:
 We use Azure as the directory.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to access a Samba share (on Ubuntu) from a windows machine on a different subnet and a Windows machine over OpenVPN. I have setup samba, share and a user with password on the Ubuntu server, I can see the shared folder from both Windows clients, but I keep getting errors when trying to open the folder. The machine connecting over OpenVPN errors as if the username and password is incorrect, the machine on a different subnet says I don&#x27;t have permission to access the folder.
 What kind of settings do I need to look for when connecting like this as opposed to just on the same subnet? (the same configs work for the Windows 11 machine and a different Ubuntu Samba server both on 8 range).
 Site A (behind pfSense):
 Ubuntu 22.04 server with Samba share &amp; OpenVPN client (172.16.21.0/24) &amp; Windows 11 client (192.168.8.0/24)
 Site B (behind non-pfSense firewall with OpenVPN server setup (OpenVPN works for normal LAN access))
 OpenVPN on 172.16.250.0/24 with Windows 10 client on 192.168.5.0/24
 smb.conf

 The user I&#x27;m trying to use is smbuser and it has been added to the backupusers group as well.

                              <span>We&#x27;re transitioning to some new software and dropping BYOD for affected users. Order for ~65 iPads now on the docket. I&#x27;ve asked for a few quotes from a few resellers and they all came back generally the same. I expected that, its not that many devices, and negotiating regarding Apple equipment seems to be a non-question in general at this scale.
 The deployment is for only remote employees. I&#x27;m wanting to setup an MDM and ensure maintenance and processes are defined, tested, and documented within the two months I have to complete the project. I&#x27;m at the stage now where I can order some devices from a reseller I&#x27;ve been working with and make sure the auto enrollment and deployment works.
 My boss now wants me to look at a few other vendors to verify we&#x27;re getting the best possible deal. I explained my concern regarding it being more important that our setup is clean and efficient in terms of management and deployment, but was told to hold off ordering anyways. Even at scoring something like 10% off its only going to save ~$2500. The idea that I have to redo my work with another vendor to integrate with ABM and setup drop shipping, waiting for the confirmation on their side, etc. to save that amount of money makes it sound like the more expensive option.
 Want to hear the perspective of other people and see what they do/how they would handle this. It feels like splitting hairs, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong.

                              <span>Morning,
 Small company with two offices and two sites in AD, both sites have a DC running DNS. The smaller site, lets call it site 2, with one DC and just five workstations had an issue over the weekend apparently, each workstation this morning after logging in had an error that they were connected to a new network and asking if they wanted to enable network discovery. Some said yes, some said no, some just left it.
 None of them can access the server by server name \\server2 and of course they only app they use accesses the server by server name.
 Did some testing, they can ping the server IP and it resolves, they can access the shares by IP address. Same thing is happening on the DC in this site. This also happens if they try to access a server by name in site 1. Everything in site 1 is fine by the way.
 Kerberos Event ID 4 is showing up on the server and the workstations. Did the suggested SPN duplicate search but didn&#x27;t find any duplicates.
 What I did find was if I tried to ping the domain name it would return an IP address other than the server. It is actually just an IP address from the DHCP pool and not actually assigned to anything. This was happening on the server and the desktops.
 I went into DNS and removed that entry. At that point the server in site 2 started working and could access its own shares by name. Workstations could not so I rebooted them with no change. Rebooted server and it still works and so do a handful of the desktops. Some of the desktops still give the error and can&#x27;t access by name.
 They give the same event id 4 in the event viewer with the name of whatever server we try to access. Ping is working on these workstations for both domain name and server name. IP and DNS info all look good. Not sure what to try to get these other workstations going. Hoping somebody has a suggestion.

                              <span>Boss, has a few hourly people that need to block from using email on their cell outside of work hours.
 We are testing Intune, but don&#x27;t think it does this. You can turn off notifications from Outlook, but still open and use them.
 If you disable mobile and OWA, can new Outlook still work or through portal.office.com.
 And can I still set up the default mail app on phones?
 Also, when Intune was setup they used the 6 digit pin, is there anyway to go back to 4 digit pins?
 I think its better to just make a policy that states &quot;don&#x27;t check or reply to email outside work hours.&quot; And not make mobile email more painful.

                              <span>How many agents running on a machine is too many? Seems like every time we get rid of a running agent, the powers that be fall in love with a shiny new toy that must exist on every endpoint. Then they wonder why our laptops get under 2 hours of battery life on average. Anyhow, these are the agents and apps that launch on every win 10 machine in our environment:
  
Zscaler
 Rapid 7
 Crowdstrike
 Configuration manager (SCCM)
 Cisco anyconnect (Zscaler does the same Job)
 Lakeside software Systems Management Agent Systrack
 Jabra express (Headphone support software, but only half the company uses jabra headsets nowadays)
 Zoom
 Teams
 Citrix receiver (because why not)
  
I&#x27;m sure I missed one or 2 but its crazy to me. Does anyone else run these many agents or am I the crazy one for thinking its a bit much?

 I have a machine I connect to remotely (via AnyDesk/TV etc) that I need to image and redeploy on a different PC which also has windows and will be accessed remotely the same way, creating the image is easy enough since Macrium can make a shadowcopy, but to restore it I would usually have to boot some media, but since its done remotely I can&#x27;t do that, I was wondering if you guys know a way to do so without much user input (external HDD would be used to hold the image and move to the other PC)
 many thanks

                              <span>Good morning fellow Redditors. Ive seen over the years a number of these posts asking for suggestions for a small, portable, awesome monitor solution, and Ive checked out a few of them in the past, but its been a while since Ive seen anything.
 Last week I was pulled out to a location and found myself scrambling to find and then hook up a monitor. Got me thinking that its time for me to be serious about this, and look for something.
 I know in the past there is a lot of suggestions for pi-kvm-type items. But Im honestly just looking for a small monitor that does VGA/HDMI etc. When I go to some of these locations, there is a single computer sitting there, headless. 
 I carry with my a super small Logitech keyboard/mouse device, so thats taken care of, just need something awesome to have in my vehicle for these situations.
 Whats the 2023 suggestions to accomplish this task?
 Appreciate it all!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been searching the internet for confirmation to this question, but I cannot find a concrete answer.
 I have a ProLiant ML350 Gen10 that we are adding more hard drives to. Currently, there is only one box that has hard drives installed, and that back plane plugs directly into the RAID controller.
 To install another box of hard drives, a SAS expander card needs to be installed. If I&#x27;m understanding this documentation correctly, I will install the SAS expander card, plug it into the RAID controller, then plug the back planes of the hard drive boxes into the SAS expander.
 My million dollar question is this: will the RAID that is currently running on the server survive the migration to the SAS expander?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for an application to manage AiO computer in kiosk mode. I don&#x27;t need advanced options; basically, I just need to navigate through the Intranet. In theory, Windows Full Screen Kiosk Mode would be perfect, except for one thing - it doesn&#x27;t allow to exit a PDF. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to bypass that. In theory, I could set up a Kiosk without Full Screen, but then I would have to block numerous websites, whereas with Full Screen, I set Intranet as the default page and people can&#x27;t exit from it. Can you recommend any user-friendly and straightforward Kiosk apps for Windows?
 To be precise, I want the computer to be constantly running in Kiosk mode, and after a few minutes of inactivity, it should clear all data and return to the homepage. I have set the company&#x27;s website as the homepage, and there is no way to navigate outside of it. You can only browse work-related news, log in to your profile to check your salary or remaining vacation days. And here lies the problem because employee data is generated in PDF format. The Kiosk with Edge easily opens the PDF, but there is no button to return to the previous page. One has to stand by the kiosk and wait for a few minutes until it clears the data and returns to the homepage.

Our radius server is expecting a regex for the FQDN so fails dot1x but passes when the computer is MABed.
 Background: These computers are part of our parent org’s domain and cannot be re-imaged. They have been added ti the appropriate AD OU, assigned correct groups, etc. These computers are also receiving all our domain GPOs and have a machine certificate from our CA. We have no issues with our own imaged computers.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>We have a lot of VM running at Proxmox VE
 Also, we have /26 network and VMs with IPs of this network.
 (We use OVH bare metal servers and network )
 One of those VMs used as a router/firewall for controlling the traffic of /26 network and has two IP addresses - X.X.X.123 and X.X.X.124.
 Trace to VM with IP X.X.X.111 looks like this:
 world -&gt; OVH gateway -&gt; X.X.X.123 -&gt; X.X.X.111
 Trace from VM with IP X.X.X.111 looks like this:
 X.X.X.111 -&gt; X.X.X.124 -&gt; OVH gateway -&gt; world
 So we have different interfaces for incoming and outgoing traffic.
 This was configured by adding a route:
 X.X.X.X/26 dev eth2 proto kernel scope link src X.X.X.124 metric 101
 From time to time traffic tries go throw X.X.X.123 ( eth1 ) instead of X.X.X.124 ( eth2 ) and all VMs with IP of /26 network lose acces to the internet. We can see this using tcpdump.
 This issue happened on Centos 7 and RHEL 9 now.
 After restart of Network Manager it works as expected but for a short time.
 Also, it works after moving router VM to another node.
 It starts about a year ago, but I still cannot find solution or even find a root of issue.
 So if you have any idea what it could be - please help me...

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I&#x27;ve been contemplating my career path in the field of infrastructure, particularly in Canada. Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed a trend where it seems like there&#x27;s a significant number of individuals interested in infrastructure roles, possibly even more than in development. I wanted to gather insights from experienced professionals to get a better understanding of the current state of the infrastructure job market in Canada.
 I would appreciate your input on the following questions:
  
Is the infrastructure job market in Canada more competitive than the development job market? Or is it the other way around?
 Are there specific regions in Canada where infrastructure opportunities are more abundant?
 How has the demand for infrastructure professionals is evolving, especially in the cloud field ?
  
Please feel free to share your observations, personal experiences, or any valuable insights regarding the infrastructure job market in Canada. I believe this discussion will not only benefit me but also others who are navigating their career paths in this domain.
 Thank you in advance for your contributions and expertise!

                              <span>Hey there, Reddit community! 
 Today, let&#x27;s talk about Optimizing airflow and cooling in server racks. Here are some practical tips:
  
Organize cables: Proper cable management improves airflow by preventing obstructions. Use cable trays and ties to keep cables tidy. 
 
Hot and cold aisle containment: Separate hot and cold airflow paths using physical barriers like curtains or panels. This enhances cooling efficiency and prevents recirculation. 
 
Rack placement: Ensure sufficient space between racks to allow for proper airflow. Avoid clustering them too closely.
 
Blanking panels: Cover empty rack spaces with blanking panels to optimize airflow and prevent recirculation of hot air. 
 
Regular maintenance: Clean or replace air filters, check fan operation, and perform regular maintenance to prevent dust accumulation and ensure proper cooling. 
 
Ventilation options: Choose racks with perforated or mesh doors for better airflow. Consider adding fans or ventilation units if necessary. 
 
Temperature monitoring: Use environmental monitoring tools to track temperature and humidity levels. This helps identify areas needing additional cooling or adjustments.
 
 Remember to share your experiences and insights in the comments. Let&#x27;s discuss how you manage airflow and cooling in your server racks!

                              <span>Hi, 
 Looking for some advice on which Azure VM spec I should be spinning up.
 We are have an employee in the Philippines (we are based in Aus) who we would like to get online through a VM. Usage will be limited to using Office (including Teams) and web.
 Is the B1 series sufficient or do we need to go to B2? As far as starting and stopping the machine could this be done by the employee to cut costs? What is the standard practice for shutting down the VM during off hours?
 Thanks

                              <span>Just Saying, I know the &#x27;normal&#x27; reason why SSL VPN is touted as &#x27;superior&#x27; - i.e its on port 443 and can &#x27;punch through&#x27; a lot of basic filtering so may work more reliable for traveling users. 
 But for orgs who run only IP-sec (i.e MS AoVPN or similar), how often is that an issue in practice. 
 Lots of SSL VPN Vulns, and while SASE is an option, its also a very expensive one vs rolling basic to good ole Ip-sec - curious what the experince is like these days and if its as bad as the vendor FUD would let you believe.

                              <span>Hi all,
 My brothers company provide a hotel for businesses in which his clients have access to the wifi and they even have a guest wifi.
 ​
 Oracle send him an email stating that there has been 6 downloads of VBox Extension under PUEL (license agreement) and that means it&#x27;s for commercial use and he has to pay 6500 USD for licenses. If we don&#x27;t they will perform audit and eventually law suit which of course the business hotel will have to pay for according to Oracle.
 ​
 My brother is concerned and don&#x27;t know what to do. They can&#x27;t identify who did it on the network as people can bring personal computers or log onto the guest wifi.
 ​
 It says on their site &quot;By downloading, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective license.&quot;.The extension pack is under the PUEL which states that you are not allowed to use it for commercial use. Can he argue that it has not been used for commercial use as it was downloaded on personal PC&#x27;s? Do they have a way to see how it&#x27;s being used. This is in EU btw.

 I got the part of managing secrets and certificates expiration dates, etc...
 I haven&#x27;t foud anything about how to properly dispose unused or deprecated apps. I would like to disable them instead of brutally delete them.
 What do you think?

                              <span>I am developing a simple webapp that needs to send email &quot;Alerts/Updates&quot; to people, like stats, reports, etc. (No marketing campaigns) using alerts@mydomain.com.
 But i found that when the SMTP service is not well configured or If the text I send have spammy words (like -Please, Check, Free, etc-), emails are delivered to the spam and my domain can be reported to blacklists.
 I tried Postmarkapp, Zeptomail and SMTP2GO; Right now SMTP2GO has been working really well, and emails are getting into inbox after SPF, DKIM AND DMARK and properly configured.
 Any tips, SMTP Service recommendation or do/don&#x27;t in transactional emails? Is the first time i try to make something that will send many email messages daily.

 We currently use AudioCodes media pack to connect analog devices. I am looking for advice on how to setup this paging system process in Teams Telephony. 
 On the old system calls are parked on an extension. The person who answered calls the pages the shop floor and says call 10. Shop floor person can pickup on any phone and press 10 to pickup the call. 
 Can you please advice how this would be setup in the AutoAttendant or call queue?

 We have a few poeple that are getting regular teams meeting invites through, the problem with this is that the user who set these up left two years ago and his account was disabled then removed.
 the one thing i have noticed is that these are only coming through on Teams on iOS not on the desktop our online. I seem to remember there being an issue if teams invites were set up via iPhone but I cant find this anywhere .
 ​
 Any suggestion on this one?

                              <span>Today is the last day you can buy a Windows 10 license. Though Windows 10’s time is coming to an end, Microsoft says its last-gen operating system will remain supported with security updates until October 14, 2025.
 We already knew Microsoft will no longer sell Windows 10 licenses, as it posted notices in multiple places online notifying users that it will end digital downloads of Windows 10 on January 31, 2023. Back in June 2021, the company announced it would stop supporting Windows 10 in 2025.
 Recently, the Redmond-based tech giant pulled the plug on the last remaining support for Windows 7. It also ended support for Windows 8 and 8.1. It’s easy to see Microsoft’s end goal, namely to make Windows 11 the only Microsoft operating system you can officially buy. Then checkout (Microprokey).

                              <span>I&#x27;m an ex penetration tester. After working for 10 years at various companies I found that many of them do things the old way to keep charging clients more and on a per day basis.
 A couple of years ago, I resigned and went about creating my own penetration testing and fixed the issues below.
 ​
  
Unlimited free re-tests: Current penetration testing companies charge you twice, once for the penetration test, second time (or more for re-tests). I built a model that offers unlimited free re-tests
 Scoping: I built an algorithm that automates most of the scoping process so now you can get quotes automatically for most standard projects. No need to wait days for a quote
 Reporting: I&#x27;ve created a system that generates the final reports immediately when the test is done, need to wait 10 working days for a final report..
 Crowd Testing: Some clients want several penetration testers to have a look at their targets but most pen testing companies can&#x27;t accomedate that. With my setup, I can assign as much as 10 penetration testers to each project
 24 Start: I&#x27;ve setup our penetration testers and team in a way that allows me to start a penetration test in 24 hours no matter the time of the year. This helped with clients that need urgent work
  
​
 Now I&#x27;m at a point where I want to invest and improve things for everyone even more but was wondering what issues you guys have faced during penetration testing that you would like fixed.

                              <span>Context: working for 10+ years as VMware export at a 20K+ employee comapny. Stack is 1000 hosts, multi PB storage, globally distributed HCI, 10000s of VMs.
 The company has directives to do heavy savings across the board (not just IT). On IT side there&#x27;s announced initiatives to move from VMware to a precieved cheaper solution.
 As part of a big recent re-org, multiple &quot;OKRs - Objective Key Results&quot; are at put on all teams, and many of them includes cost saving (nothing odd considering that financial situation). I&#x27;m in charge of following up some of those ORK in our team. One such objective has this exact phrasing:
 ​
 &quot;Reduce VMware team size (xx% of our total costs) as we will have less and less VM (customers will go on XX)&quot;
 ​
 Now to the main essence behind this post:
 ​
 Cost savings and new vendor migrations aside (they need to be simply accepted), I just find it outright bizarre to be asked, as a technical team, to &quot;help us rationalize yourself away&quot;. It&#x27;s clearly management topics.
 What&#x27;s your take on this? Management is taking the easy way out to not work on the reduction plans themselves in my eyes.
 Time to update Linked-in? :D :P

 Can anyone guide me how I can get an SSRS report that is generating a csv file to put it on SharePoint online instead of a shared folder.
 Or an automated way to get it from the folder to SharePoint.

                              <span>Does anyone happen to have SNMP MIBs for the Nokia 7360 ISAM FX platform? Among other things, I am hoping to find an OID that reports light levels for ONT optics as we are not using AMS.
 I have been searching but can&#x27;t find anything other than other people asking similar questions.

                              <span>Hi all, I recently started in tech and am trying to educate myself. The company I work for has the marketing slogan &quot;single pane of glass&quot; network management but after reading through reddit feeds, this is a term people are tired of hearing.
 I&#x27;m sure most companies don&#x27;t deliver on that term, making it gimicky and overused, but is there really a valid desire/need to manage through a single pane of glass? Many people I talk to are using 3-4 different vendors, so I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s not really a &quot;pain point&quot; to manage a bunch of different dashboards for different parts of the network or if people have just never experienced a true &quot;single pane of glass&quot; so they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing.
 For example, i&#x27;ll hear: we&#x27;re using palo alto for firewalls, mix of ubiquiti and meraki for wireless, and aruba and cisco for everything else...wouldn&#x27;t that be annoying to manage all separately?
 Thankful for all thoughts and lived experiences shared!

                              <span>I was wondering what you all use and have used in your campus networks for access switches, how they have been performing, what features they have, and the cost. I&#x27;ve been mainly using Cisco and I have found that I really just need a L2 switch with secure mgmt. If I could find a switch that just has basic L2 features and a few that might not be so common, that would be great. My access switches just provide connection to thin clients, VoIP phones, and printers, so I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend money on cisco products and licenses if I can just buy something more simple. But then again I don&#x27;t really know if Cisco is currently the most expensive route.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for in an access switch:
 -RSTP, (and MST if possible)
 -802.1q
 -LACP
 -PoE
 -SSH
 -SNMP
 Things that would be nice:
 -TACACS+ (or other encrypted mgmt aaa)
 -802.1x and or MAB support
 -HTTPS interface
 Just curious what is out there that might be cheaper. It seems like every time I put a new switch in place I just add the vlans, enable portfast for the hosts, configure username/tacacs, disable services, prune the trunk and if I&#x27;m feeling crazy double check the root bridge. I don&#x27;t need VRFs, VXLANs, or GRE. I definitely don&#x27;t need BGP or even OSPF lol 
 Let me know what you guys use for access switches.
 (I&#x27;m currently using Cisco 9200/9300s)

                              <span>I own a small ISP operating overseas for US military at a deployed location. Currently we are using DMA RADIUS manager but their solution doesn’t meet our requirements anymore. I need to be able to allow customers to buy one account, but be able to have 5 concurrent devices running at a max bandwidth of 50mbps download. Does anyone have any ideas on what RADIUS manager I can use that will allow that? We don’t have a lot of money so preferably an inexpensive solution. I won’t be the one implementing, I’m just helping our folks on the ground do some research.

                              <span>Sorry if this is not relevant to this subreddit. I want to bring up a virtual testbed, say with 2 spines and 4 leaves simulating a DC, and run BGP EVPN between them. I want to do that using either Docker or VM on my laptop (is memory going to be a concern) and then, write a script that I could run from my laptop to trace packets going across the VMs. I am assuming there has to be a bridge in Linux that should connect all these VMs together, so I basically want to &#x27;listen&#x27; on that bridge. Does anyone have suggestions on where I can start looking for ideas on how to implement this? Thanks (And vendor would preferably be Cisco NXOS as its for DC).

 I&#x27;ve got a 55,000 sq/ft warehouse that&#x27;s having a lot of dead zones in it likely due to the placement of aisles and materials. I&#x27;m pretty familiar with WiFi but know when I&#x27;m out of my depth, I don&#x27;t want to blindly throw APs at the problem. I suspect some sort of specialized/highly directional antennas will be needed to shoot down these long aisles, but I don&#x27;t have the equipment to really verify that for sure.
 I&#x27;ve got the budget and approval to hire professionals, but would prefer some personal recommendations as opposed to whoever&#x27;s paid for the best SEO to get up in the google results.

                              <span>I’m in the middle of a building upgrade to Aruba 635 APs and I’m already seeing a few 6GHz clients. Mostly Pixel and Samsung phones. We are also deploying new laptops with Windows 11 and Intel AX211/210 WiFi cards. 
 Anyone that is further ahead than me, how is 6GHz going for you? Do you see a lot of clients picking that as their band?

                              <span>For all the circuits we own, I see almost all telcos using RAD, Adtran or Cienna as their NID/CPE. Any reason why this is so?
 I am curious to know how easy these devices are when it comes to cost, management and configuration.
 Why are these devices non existant in the enterprise world?

                              <span>Hello Networking community!
 While both Cisco &amp; Fortinet claim to provide best SD-WAN solutions, I&#x27;m curious to know the distinct features and capabilities that set them apart.
 So, my question is: What are some specific functionalities or advantages that Cisco SD-WAN offers, which are not available in Fortinet SD-WAN? And conversely, what unique capabilities does Fortinet SD-WAN have that Cisco SD-WAN lacks?
 I appreciate any insights or experiences you can share to help me understand the key differences between these two solutions.
 Thank you !

                              <span>Hi there! Can anyone in the know advise on what underlying technologies are used in the proprietary sd-wan products for per-packet load sharing? Are they all self-written or there&#x27;s something based on open source elements? I&#x27;m trying to build something for linux on my own to load share a few bundles 4g links. Per ip/connection load sharing is straightforward. But I can&#x27;t find anything relevant for per-packet steering. Any clues, hints?

                              <span>Environment:
 I have already setup Dual WAN using TPLINK-ER605 where, WAN and WAN 1 are used.
 Load balancing is enabled where, WAN is Primary WAN and WAN1 is Backup WAN.
 Problem:
 I performed several test where I found that, when the Primary WAN was removed it took around 30-40 seconds to enable the Backup WAN. And again, when the Primary backup was inserted back it took around 1 minutes to restore the Primary link.
 Solution ?
 1.Can any body has been through the similar test before and found the same result?
 2.Is there any other process or settings that I can minimize the backup wan enabling time and primary backup link restore time?
 Thankyou in advance

                              <span>SUMMARY
In 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific in 2023. Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in obse…</span>

                              <span>I typically lurk but I wanted to post this because I&#x27;m just so fucking pissed off.
 So for context, my company operates in three states and we have a few buildings (24/7) throughout each. We have two sysadmins in one state managing two of those states as they&#x27;re close, and then I&#x27;m the sysadmin for the other one. We each participate in a weekly on-call rotation. Typically we don&#x27;t get calls that often, and if we do have to take extra time after-hours, we can just cut that time off of Friday afternoon and sign off early. 
 We have an MSP contracted as our helpdesk, and man they fucking suck. It&#x27;s a lot to explain, but they&#x27;re just...dumb. I was woken up by a call at 3:45 AM, my phone is always on silent but it rings when I have music playing from my bluetooth speaker. I&#x27;m pissed because it …</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 This is my first post, so I&#x27;m a bit confused. I have been working in the web hosting industry for over a decade and currently hold a position as a Technical Support Staff, specializing in Linux System Administration, for a well-known company. It&#x27;s a great company with excellent management, and I have a very supportive supervisor. Overall, I love this job and excel at it.
 However, I feel that the compensation is not sufficient, and I am considering relocating to another country in the near future. I understand that my current salary may not be adequate in the new location.
 My expertise lies in web hosting support, particularly with cPanel, DirectAdmin, and related areas. I would like to broaden my skill set to pursue a higher-paying job. If you have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate hearing about the field you chose and any advice you may have regarding additional skills I could learn alongside my current role. I also have proficiency in Bash scripting and troubleshooting WordPress, and I can develop basic websites. However, beyond that, I have limited experience. I have attempted to learn a few programming languages, but given my age (currently 32), I am uncertain if programming is the right fit for me. Are there any other areas I should consider learning alongside my Linux System Administration and Technical Support role?
 I appreciate your time, opinions, and any advice you can provide.
 Thank you.

                              <span>This is an amazing resource! A month ago, I got hired as a permanent systems engineer having zero experience in the field, I used to work in a call centre (not even help desk). I work in a big company and the team has not had a new hire in the last 5 years. I am just a bit worried that it&#x27;s been a month and I still don&#x27;t have responsibilities of my own or access to everything. I have been able to shadow a few team mates and they are there for questions but I&#x27;m not really getting training as such. A quarterly meeting is coming and I should have a more solid responsibility then but it&#x27;s been a month and I haven&#x27;t been doing anything. Is this a normal experience for starters/juniors?

 Seems like it might be a good time to do backend maintenance...

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin, 
 Looking for some discussion on what the thoughts are on user local admin rights. 
 Currently we are using something called MakeMeAdmin, This allows users to elevate permissions to install and do admin activities on their machine. The biggest downside to this, is there is no way to track what is being done.
 I had the idea of using our MFA solution and CrowdStrike Identity. What my idea was, grant users admin rights to their local machine, but put a policy in place that makes them confirm an MFA prompt from DUO when elevation is requested. I still don’t think there is a way to track what is being done, but I can track who is using admin rights, and how often. 
 I’d love to discuss what everyone’s thoughts are or if there is an even better way to handle this?

 ​
 I am trying to read files from an old Micropolis 1588 SCSI disk. I have a SCSI card setup on a XP machine and it worked fine when reading a somewhat newer SCSI disk 3,5 inch. 
 Harddrive: Micropolis 1588
 SCSI Card: Tekram DC-395UW
 I have it connected with the 50pin cable, no terminators. The hdd spins up and is detected and shows up as Id 0 in Tekram screen when booting up. But nothing when in windows. What am I doing wrong? 
 Do I need to set jumpers for termination?
 Change settings for the Tekram SCSI card?
 ​
 Appreciate your help

All the guides I&#x27;m reading on FSLogix talk about using Azure Virtual Desktop. Is it possible to use FSLogix and store the profiles on-premises? 
 Edit to add: Is it also viable to do this in an environment that primarily uses physical desktops, and virtual machines pretty much only used as servers?

                              <span>My boss resigned last month (thank goodness) and now I’m part of the panel to interview for new bosses. I’ve interview for technical positions in the past and once for a director position but it was just myself and the candidates, not 5 other people ( I hate interview panels..) When I’ve interviewed in the past, I tried to keep it more of a conversation, I feel like this isn’t possible in a panel type interview.
 We’re given a list of a dozen questions that we have to ask (split between us,) no idea what they are and then we do a round table of questions to ask our own questions - I have no idea what everyone else is going to ask - I recommended we set up a pre meeting to discuss but it wasn’t well received ( the interview is already scheduled for 4 hours…) 
 So, I’m trying to create a list of engaging questions I can ask.
 If you were in my shoes, what would you ask?

                              <span>As a rule, how do you install software when both EXE and MSI options are available? Do u have a preference or standardize on one over the other? Or is it decided on a case by case basis? Or does it really matter? I didn&#x27;t think it did for many years but have recently run across a couple cases where we inconsistently used a mix of EXE and MSI installers for products. Now we are trying to upgrade those products using one consistent method but the MSI upgrade won&#x27;t update software installed by EXE, and vice versa. It&#x27;s making quite a mess as we sometimes end up with two installs each.

                              <span>We have a problem with one of our Nodes that needs 3 new disks.
 We have a 3 Node Cluster, first two installed in 2020, with the third installed in February. The disks in the third node are Samsung Evo 870s, with the disks in the other two Samsung Evo 860s.
 Two weeks ago, we had three disks in the third Node fail and we&#x27;re unable to get 870s as a replacement as these are no longer being made. As a result, we&#x27;ve sourced 4 brand new enterprise grade Samsung SSDs.
 We&#x27;ve managed to retire the first drive, however, it gets stuck when trying to remove it from the storage pool. We think this is because it&#x27;s still trying to do a Volume repair due to the dodgy disks. So it gets to 89% then goes back to the beginning and is in an endless loop trying to remove the disk from the storage pool.
 We&#x27;ve moved all VMs off the third node, but we&#x27;re unable to pause the Node due to the problem with the disks...
 What is the best way forward, just pull the disks out and replace them or forcibly evict the Node from the Cluster?
 We don&#x27;t want any corruption or problems though.
 Any advice greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hey fellow Sysadmins, my personal Schitt Modi 3 took a...well a Schitt, and I am in need of a new DAC. I have never really been happy with the Schitt, so I was curious if any one here had any reccomendations for a new DAC. I do not do anything too crazy, mainly just listening to music when I get woken up at 2 am and am in troubleshooting mode, or catching up on documentation at home. I thought I would ask here instead of one of the Audio sub-reddits, as I am looking for something sensible, not something insane

                              <span>So this is making me scratch my head. I&#x27;ve got a lovely IKEV2/IPSEC tunnel setup between an AWS environment, and onprem. Both sides using Strongswan as the endpoints. Routing rules are applied in the Strongswan instances via iptables.
 The onprem side is behind NAT, so the required ports are forwarded. Everything works great, but what I cannot understand is, how do my other network devices know how to find the tunnel? Presumably packets destined for AWS must be directed to the Strongswan VM which in turn knows the route, but by what mechanism are packets arriving at the Strongswan VM in the first place?

 Debian 10
 Client:
 Windows 11
 I use my file server as a no-authentication access terminal in my computer room. I&#x27;m not worried about someone one coming in, joining the network, and downloading my stuff. If anything, being able to easily do that is great since the few times people do want to do it, those people have no idea what a hard disk is, more or less what Samba is.
 I&#x27;ve been using Samba for years now, but I heard that NFS has less overhead and wanted to try it out. It was easier to set up and get running. It took me longer to get Windows set up to read the share then to make the share.
 I did the anonyms registry for User and Group since I&#x27;m not overly concerned about security.
 Now the issue (in windows) is that if I leave a window (or a panel in Double Commander) pointing anywhere in the share and then come back after a minute or two, it hangs for about 8 seconds before resuming.
 Is this normal for NFS shares, or did I misconfigure something?
 The feedback from windows mount;

                              <span>Hello,
 We have a customer that we are taking care of his BGP peering needs by using our Cisco ASR router running IOS-XR. In order to do so we configured a VRF instance and local-as within the VRF&#x27;s BGP configuration (it&#x27;s a special case and normally we do not do this).
 Unfortunately, using this setup our own AS number gets involved in the AS-Path, ie instead of having an AS-Path of 12345 12345 12345 (with prepending), we have an AS-Path which looks like 12345 56789 12345 12345 12345 (with 12345 being the customer&#x27;s AS and ours being 56789, of course these are not the real AS numbers). The BGP peers do not like this, so they reject it in their BGP filters.
 Is there any way to workaround the above issue with IOS-XR? I &#x27;ve spent a couple of days researching this, but could not come up with any solution. Thanks for your time.
 Best regards,
 G

                              <span>in our network we have Cisco switch 2960 G all of our clients connect to this switch. this switch connected to our HP DL380, on this HP server someone installed ESXi and on this ESXi we have more than 50 VMs. some VMs are Linux and some of them are windows. our Linux servers and windows servers use 192.168.90.0/24 , our clients use 192.168.91.0/24 , our switch connected to Mikrotik router model of this Mikrotik router us RB1100Hx4 , our internet go to this mikrotik router and from mikrotik go to our cisco switch and all of clients can access to internet.
 from this week after power outage all servers and router and switch restarted, after restart some of Linux servers can not ping and we can not access to these servers. we can not ssh or ping these servers.
 ​
 from our HP servers three cables come out and these three cables connect to port 33 and 35 and 36 of the switch.
 today we can not to ESXi web interface and we can not ping ESXi IP of web interface .
 After test many things. I unplug of cable from 33 and everything go fine and after that we have access to ESXi web interface and ping and SSH all Linux servers comeback .
 How I can find the problem and try to solve this.
 I have access to Cisco switch and Mikrotk router and can put configs of these devices here.

                              <span>So, they&#x27;ve got above-ground fiber between my building and main building at work where I started recently. 
 They said after a storm the fiber stopped working so they are using ubiquity wifi external antennas instead to connect the two buildings.
 After I replaced a couple of smaller unmanaged switch in my building with a new larger managed switch I poked around and found the fiber to copper converter wasn&#x27;t getting any power. Found the plug the power brick for the converter was dead.. Plugged it into another plug and got power.. Yay
 So now I get the the copper cat 5 plugged into my laptop and get the hoped for activity lights blinking and the gigabit connection light as well.. But just get unidentified network on laptop
 I Plug it into the switch instead
 The switch shows the port change to UP state and I again have activity and Gb connection
 Port shows its up but no ip or any connection info/network.
 Still have to investigate the other side the fiber connects to the switch in other building But, it gets a connection and there is all lights blinking as if there is traffic flow 
 Not sure where to take this beyond checking other end connections. 
 Even if signal sucked due to messed up fiber, if it detects a gb connection and shows traffic, I should have at least spotty network connection no? 
 Any suggestions welcome! 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m one of the authors for Mastering OpenVPN, the author of Troubleshooting OpenVPN, and the maintainer of EasyRSA. In light of Apollo and other 3rd party apps going dark on the 30th, I figured I&#x27;d &quot;turn in my notice&quot; on Reddit and do the normal sysadmin data dump/brown bag before I&#x27;m gone. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this group and hope things get sorted in the long run.
 I think others here in this sub should do similar, and share their niche/experience.No idea where the next platform will be, but it was 4chan, /., Digg, then here. I&#x27;m not in other social media, so if any of you have suggestions, please share.

                              <span>We have a remote site with a VPN router back to DC, standard stuff.
 Site goes down completely, so no visibility inside at all. Spent some time coaching the service desk to get some trace routes and pings from the users, photos of router status LEDs and checking with the ISP for known service outages in the area.
 Too much time goes on we decide to just get a contractor / tech hand out there to console me in to the router via a remote connection to their laptop.
 There are four built in switch ports on the router and two of these are configured, one for LAN and one for WAN. I&#x27;m consoled in now, router is not dead, good. But WAN interface is down. I can see LAN is up then I notice another port that is up and is not configured.
 Check logs, it came up about the same time the WAN went down.. I ask the tech to move what ever is in that port to the WAN and.. boom, sites back up.. someone had literally moved the WAN cable into another port!! WHY?
 I tell the tech to ask them who has been in here (comms room) today, who was in here at the time network went down, why are they moving cables.
 The site managers response was &quot;well the wifi was running slow and that happens sometimes and what we do is we just move this cable from one port to another it comes good again&quot;.
 WHAT
 No, seriously, in a technical sense it is completely impossible. I even reviewed config backups for a sanity check. There has only ever been one WAN port. What the heck man. 
 ​
 TLDR site manager troubleshooting site wifi decided to move the WAN connection on their router to another port.

                              <span>The company I work for hired two co owners of our MSP to run our IT department. Officially we have a new outsourced chief information officer. He&#x27;s planning to spend a bit of dough getting our systems aligned with the systems they setup for other companies. They want to host our websites, software, and applications instead of using google and aws as we&#x27;ve been doing. I guess they want users to be logging into hosted computers as well. I&#x27;m not thrilled with the mgmt style and I think they&#x27;re just trying to load their pockets but... I&#x27;m interested to see how they migrate and implement the different technology. It&#x27;s really the only reason I&#x27;m still at this job. 
 Does this seem like an issue, or is this just how business works?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been trying this problem and nothing fixed
 I&#x27;ve been making notes of these Windows updates errors and they all have something in common, I can&#x27;t seem to fix them and get the systems back into a state of functioning updates. No matter what I&#x27;ve tried they persist and prevent some or all of the updates from installing.
 there are the errors that change like 0x80070424, 0x800703ee etc...
 I have tried running all malware antivirus scans and there is no foul play to my knowledge.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Running dism to repair it (even with a extracted new windows image file)
 Running sfc /scannow
 installing window from flash drive on another pc and hard reset and everything
 Cleaning the C: drive and temp folder
 Removing old updates and trying to re-run updates
 Manually downloading window
 3rd party programs like reset windows update tool and sfcfix
 Updating/uninstalling/reinstalling Microsoft&#x27;s redistributables and runtimes
 i have reset pc for like 6 times
 Ive tried running the troubleshooter, and running a windows update repair
  
I&#x27;m fresh out of ideas and I&#x27;ve been researching these issues for 3 days
 I wish there was some way to fix and is there any fix to this problem and thank you in advance please

                              <span>Scenario:
 One Windows 11 PC (&quot;Win11&quot;) and one Windows 10 PC (&quot;Win10&quot;) on a LAN. Accounts under the same (admin) name (&quot;Userguy&quot;) on both devices. RDP is properly configured on both devices, and a login preset (Username: &quot;Win10\Userguy&quot;, password: &quot;3xample&quot;) has been set up on Win11 to login on Win10. These credentials work when entered manually.
 Issue:
 When trying to RDP from Win11 into Win10 from a shortcut or selecting Win10 from the dropdown in the RDP interface, the login always fails and a window opens to enter login details. In the window the default user name reads &quot;Win11\Userguy&quot; instead of &quot;Win10\Userguy&quot;, which then has to be entered manually again, and the right password. Which work fine. But even when saving these credentials, the next time the issue happens again.
 Edit:
 After doing a manual save of the preset, it now seems to properly save the username (&quot;Win10\Userguy&quot;) but the login still fails and I am dumped in the Windows Security dialogue (&quot;Your credentials did not work&quot;) which asks me to enter the correct credentials. Now the default username reads &quot;Win10\Userguy&quot; but if I just enter the password I am returned to the Windows Security dialogue (&quot;Your credentials did not work&quot;), and only after using &quot;More choices&quot; and entering the credentials again (username and password) does the login succeed.

                              <span>Bit of a weird one. We&#x27;ve setup a new Dell PowerEdge server to replace an old Small Business Server. It&#x27;s a decent spec machine with 64gb memory and 4 x SAS SSD (with the higher end RAID card) running Windows Server 2022 Std.
 The server feels really solid and quick when its running and setting it up we&#x27;ve had no issue. However at some unknown point it&#x27;s started taking a crazy long time to boot, like 40 - 45 mins. It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.
 I&#x27;ve checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:
 Distributed Transactions Coordinator
 Diagnostics Policy
 Network Access Policy 
 But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.
 The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.
 It&#x27;s an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any errors other than the services are just timing out with the error &quot;A timeout was reached while waiting for .
 Anyone seen this before?

                              <span>Does anyone have suggestions for an outlook add-in that would help manage all the daily alerts that come in? I’m thinking something that could summarize alerts from a system, but if the number, or type of alert changes from the “normal” then we get a high importance email, otherwise something that would summarize the nightly alerts. I don’t want to set up rules necessarily, because I don’t want them all to go, I just want fewer I guess. Or a summary of the ones we do get.

                              <span>I&#x27;m used to macOS where screenshotting is built in, shows a region window upon hotkey combination, and instantly saves an unaltered png to your desktop. thats literally all I want. no other frills. 
 I&#x27;ve used both shareX and greenshot- sharex felt way too clunky and I hate that the region selector for greenshot is a transparent green- completely unnecessary imo. 
 Is there a better alternative? I know I could use ctrl+win+s, but I hate that I don&#x27;t have a way to auto redirect the output to my desktop as a png, instead it goes to some random-ass folder that I have to dig for. 
 Thanks &lt;3

                              <span>2 years ago converted all offices from Cisco to fortinet for firewall, switches and wireless. Love having everything under one interface for management. Problem is the wireless and FortiAPs. Users randomly complaining about wireless drops, slow speed, poor handoff between APs. 
 Have worked with fortinet tac and have upgraded firmware, adjusted settings. Problem is each tech has different opinions on what settings to use. No combination of firmware/settings seems to be correct. A change may correct one issue but then either introduce a new issue or make a pre existing issue worse. 
 I am getting to the point where I want to throw in the towel on fortinet wireless and swap to another product line. 
 I know I am going to get lots of different answers. Which wireless vendor is best for simple Wi-Fi network deployments? Trying to get something where I can set it and forget it and stop getting complaints from users on a weekly basis.

                              <span>Ohai, I figured all of you are in the situation of &quot;being the computer guy&quot; in your families, and would know a good tool.
 I hadn&#x27;t touched gotomeeting since mid 2010&#x27;s, and what it is now is too overwhelming for the guy I&#x27;m trying to help. Back in the day, it was just &quot;Open thing, here&#x27;s the meeting code, click ok till we&#x27;re in a meeting, hit share screen, hit give control.&quot; Now it&#x27;s prompting for accounts, has the whole zoom presenter-isms, attendee popups, and overall so much noise that I couldn&#x27;t guide him into actually getting his screen successfully shared.
 So like, before I have to get in the car and drive 3 hours to go setup a RealVNC server on this guys box, do you have any better tools to recommend? I&#x27;m not on his network/not vpn, his machine is Win11 Home (no inbound RDP). Absolute minimum popups/clicks to get into the meeting is like my only concern, they panic whenever anything pops up, at all &#x3D;p

I have checked the settings, and they all appear to be the same as the other devices. Although, in the settings, one button for colour options is greyed out (sorry, I don&#x27;t have a screen grab). Can anyone suggest a simple solution besides reimaging the PC?

                              <span>In March 2023, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers organization (ICANN org) began receiving complaints alleging that the registrar Epik Inc. (Epik) is not processing domain name renewals in a timely manner despite having collected payment. The complaints also alleged that Epik&#x27;s customer support is not providing timely or substantive responses to customers inquiries. All complaints received by ICANN org have been, or are in the process of, being addressed. These include the complaints referenced in the formal breach notice ICANN org issued to this registrar on 1 June 2023.

                              <span>Reddit API costs are being put into effect to stop/slow AI model training.
 But before anyone stopped to consider asking for an API exception for bots and apps, were just protesting by having subreddits going dark temporarily/permanently on the basis that we wont have some third party app and accessibility features. which is not effective without negotiating for special app/bot exception for the API alongside the protests.
 Unless all these protests are secretly to keep API free to allow for free LLM training. Who is really behind the mass protests as AI has not been mentioned at all in the big subreddits protests/going-dark posts.
 99% of people don&#x27;t realize the API changes are meant to disallow big AI conglomerates to easily scrap reddit to train AI on our data for profit
 I dont want my data to be used to train a LLM, only to be charged to use this LLM when it comes out.

                              <span>Just wanted to reach out to the UK based sysadmins on here who may have domain/DNS records hosted with DomainCheck.co.uk. The company appears to have gone bust, likely some time in March. The records remain available but there is no way to log in and update/change anything nor do they respond on email/phone. I&#x27;ve had to fight my way around getting the domains transferred to other hosts this week so wanted to drop a note out as a heads up for others who may be in the same boat but not realise it yet.
 They are a reseller of enom.com for .com domains and they would help for those. For .co.uk Nominet will assist with getting you access to your records.
 If you are impacted, good luck and may you get records migrated with minimal fuss.

                              <span>Hey Guys, I am trying to create a search in CA which looks at whenever users from certain OU are added to groups within certain OU.
 Now I can easily get all the users added to certain OU but I am struggling to filter out the users within WHAT tab. Is there a way to do that filtering using restriction? I know I can filter out once the report is created but I was wondering if it can be done within the search properties?

                              <span>my company uses papercut mf cloud print solution aka “find me” and we add printers to computers by searching directory for “find me azure”. it allows staff to print from any xerox in the building using their badge - print jobs are stored centrally. they badge in to release it. 
 were currently having an issue where our vdi-on-thin-client users (windows 11) keep losing their printers when the vdi restarts/shuts down periodically (for whatever reason im not yet sure). we havent figured out how to make printers and the general state (bookmark, preferences) persistent via group policy and/or vmware horizon config. 
 However, this issue is not happening for all users but consistently occurring for the same users 
 Also it seems printers are only lost during local restart. when admin remotely restarts users’ vdi, the printers are not lost (a theory based on a couple examples)

                              <span>As a &quot;non&quot; who casually uses vanilla Reddit to keep up with IT memes and support, I find it relatively annoying that subreddits like r/iiiiiiittttttttt are saying they&#x27;re going dark indefinitely.
 Without proposing alternatives and the subreddit mod(s) just saying &quot;kthxbye&quot; is really a slap in the face of the us the users, not Reddit, of these niche communities.

 I&#x27;ve got a share (Data_Shares) with around 25 sub folders inside it and currently everyone has access to all sub folders. How it works is Domain Users grouo has access at Data Shares top level and all sub folders have inherited permissions. 
 But now i want to make 5 secure folders. Do i just disable inhertiance on these 5 sub folders, remove DomainUsers group and add security group (with correct users in).
 I have access based enumeration on Data_Shares so it&#x27;s going to hide the folders for anyone not in. Just want to check that&#x27;s the way to go disable inhertiance on the selected sub folders?

 I know you can use a SCIM enabled HR system to provision users into AAD, but can you provision users into AD using SCIM, which then uses AD Connect to sync up to AAD

 Tiny resume:
 Reedit is changing its API price (up to 20 million $ per year) to the third party apps that offers accessibility to ddisabled people, no ads, no porn, and also it offers better tools for subreddit moderation, things that the official reddit app doesn&#x27;t.
 Basically the blackout consist in going &quot;dark&quot; 2 days, from 12th to 14th. (or indefentely, some communities like r/ProgrammerHumor prefers to go dark indefentely)
 I hope this doesn&#x27;t break any rule, if so mods please feel free to delete my post but at lease consider what people is gonna vote. 
 Since we are sysadmins, i think we could join this blackout, we know how much painful can be this type of things irl, so i think we could join them.

 Technically these all look reasonably simple to block.
 Our environment is pretty diverse.
 If you&#x27;ve disabled these did anything stop working and if so what was it please?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am facing a terrible delay when connecting from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 20.04 via Windows Remotedesktopconnection. My download speed is 60-80 Mbps and upload 20-30 Mbps. Ping to the remote machine says 25ms. I&#x27;ve tried to do some configurations on Remotedesktopconnection window such as colour depth, bitmap caching etc but no success. Writing code has a delay of 0-0.5 seconds and opening folders with &gt;100 images takes 1-3 seconds. Opening or just dragging a single image takes 1-3 seconds as well. I do not own the remote machine so changing configurations over there might be limited. Is this sort of delay a common issue when trying to connect a windows 10 with a ubuntu 20.04 machine? Should I consider switching to windows as well for my remote system?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello. Seeking opinions. I&#x27;ll keep out some of the details to keep it short. I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.
 I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.
 So what would you do?
 A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn&#x27;t suck horribly when needed
 B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don&#x27;t ever go down at the same time
 C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn&#x27;t have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.
 Thanks

 The small company I work for has hired so many people the server rack is being evicted from the office it lives in. The plan is to build a room inside an attached shed which will house the servers, some switches, my dev machines (retired desktops on shelves), AC, and possibly become the handoff point when fibre arrives. The company has 15 staff on site, and 7mb uploads mean most things are hosted locally.
 The word &quot;shed&quot; probably makes people nervous, but it&#x27;s 7mx7mx5m tall on concrete and is used for storing supplies with CCTV inside and out, and security alarms. 
 The build plan for the server room is full insulated walls, drywall interior, and properly sealed doors (with locked doors that they don&#x27;t get keys to, outside of an emergency). Internal dimensio…</span>

 Just moved to a new place and looking for job opportunities. I have several years of experience and certifications in IT Networks. My choice initially was to transition to cybersecurity (a SOC position maybe), but that is not leading to anything at the moment. A QA position opened up for me, would this be a grab or pass?
 Edit: to add, it is a QA for a networking device

 Are we able to MLAG a couple of the 7050s switches and run an LACP PO for each vSAN node to each switch?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been searching around this section for recommendations on storage switches to be used for iSCSI SAN traffic.
 My environment is fairly easy with gigabit ethernet HP 2530 switches for SAN to Hypervisor connectivity.
 Usually I have 3 VMware hosts connected to two HP 2530 switches and going to compellent or powervault SANs.
 Our environment is mostly HP/Aruba and it would be easier for me to work with.
 I&#x27;d like to have 1/10GbE capabilities and 24 ports per switch should suffice.
 I&#x27;ve inherited this network so how it currently is configured with the existing 2530s was not my design.
 I do recall when working with VMWare support, we realized that the buffer on the 2530 was too low and was potentially impacting some performance.
 I guess I&#x27;m am not entirely sure what I should be looking for. As I have the option to standardize our sites, I think using Aruba will still be a good option, but I&#x27;m all ears.
 Ethernet or SFP should be fine, I would be looking at deploying 1gb while we wait for hardware for 10gbe connectivity.
 Any suggestions on what I should look into? I believe that buffers are critical for SAN switches but aside from that, I&#x27;m not sure.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hope you guys can help. 
 I&#x27;m going to struggle to explain this, but ill do my best.
 We have the below set up 
 Cisco Router -&gt; Fortinet -&gt; 2 x Aruba -&gt; 2 x legacy netgear switches 
 I&#x27;m aware that the Fortinet is set up as DHCP server which give out a range 10.157.....
 but when I connect to the Netgear switches they hand out 192.168.000 
 I think the netgears switches are running a DHCP service on them which is handing the 192 range out, but my question is 
 Why are the Arbuas not pulling an IP range from the netgears and or vice versa?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I&#x27;ve been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I&#x27;ve got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.
 As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.
 However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I&#x27;m only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it&#x27;s one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.
 My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I&#x27;m running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can&#x27;t seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I&#x27;m to expect out of an SRX340?

                              <span>I’m newish to the field and this is my first sysadmin job. I work at a 24x7 facility so we have an on call rotation. There’s only 3 of us on the team so we are on call frequently. On top of this they ride our ass about phone calls. If you miss a phone call you’re getting chewed out. We also have maintenance monthly on Sundays which means once a month I’m giving up my Sunday. 
 I really like what I do but these after hours calls and the frequent on call is wearing me out. Is this a normal aspect of the job that I have to get used to or is this unique to where I work. Thank you!

                              <span>I’m sure I’m not the only one that experience this.
 One for my colleagues did something without checking with the PM. So a couple of days later, we asked who did it and my colleague A said “B said to do it in a daily scrum. My response was “sorry I did not say that”. Everyone knew that I did not do it but he kept saying that I done it.
 My director and other colleagues stepped in and said “B did not say that” which I was glad. I noticed this guy A never admit his mistakes and this is not the first time he screwed things up and blame others.
 Has anyone worked with someone like that or similar?

                              <span>Over the last several months, my Hotmail account has been bombarded by a stream, 50+ per day, of scammer emails, many of which had direct links to web sites that had backdoor javascript exploits that were being used to infect visitors with banking password capturing malware. Even the unsubscribe link is using these backdoors and malware. (I just now got one &quot;RE: Ready to Glow&quot; from the email &quot;DarkSpots&quot;) I have dutifully reported them nearly ever time they&#x27;ve come in, but MS has done nothing to slow the stream of these emails. It has been at least 4 months now since it started. 
 I investigated the source of these messages myself, looking up the domains and IP addresses, and found that the links are almost entirely hosted under AWS, through their CloudFront services. The domains themselves…</span>

 I am wanting to implement a WIKI for my team. Currently we use SharePoint and it&#x27;s terrible. I don&#x27;t know if that means I&#x27;m terrible at it, and should invest more time in SharePoint. Or is there a better alternative? 
 What do you use? Would you recommend it? Happy to spend a few thousand for the right solution.

                              <span>I have a gen 2 cloud key, an 8 port enterprise switch, and an access point at home (all ubiquiti).
 I was trying to get rid of the spectrum router, and use the 8 port enterprise switch, but was not getting an internet connection through my enterprise switch. 
 Has anyone gotten a similar set up to work? I don&#x27;t have a business account, so the public IP should be dynamic.
 Edit (I tried disconnecting the spectrum router entirely, and just tried using the ubiquiti switch I.e my modems Ethernet cable was going directly into ubiquiti layer 3 switch. Spectrum router was out of the picture)

                              <span>I everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently a student in admin/sys and I&#x27;m working on a projet in my internship.
 This projet is about the auth reinforcement in general.
 Currently we&#x27;re using Kerberos and the CIO wants to put a RADIUS server instead (+ 802.1X.)
 I&#x27;ve a given solution but for my thesis and as a beginner I&#x27;m trying to figure it out why would we replace kerberos by a RADIUS.
 And more I search and more I&#x27;m convince that Kerberos is better ??
 (info we are 250 people)
 For now I found that :
 Kerberos in highly secure, provide two factor auth, SSO
 And for RADIUS honeslty I mainly found that it&#x27;s &quot;easier&quot; to manage, no really technical advantage.
 I&#x27;m really trying to have an critical POV about this to justify the need to replace kerberos, and first I tried to answer the question &quot;Why would I build up a central server with all credentials ?&quot;
 Because it&#x27;s what mainly I understood about RADIUS and I thought I&#x27;ll found instead &quot;this is an hyper secure proven solution&quot; and not just some &quot;easier to manage&quot; stuff.
 And I&#x27;m bewildered... 
 Maybe I&#x27;m wrong or not considering the real need ?
 Thx

                              <span>I know this EXO Admin Center has had a new form for quite some time now, I avoided using it. I do like the interface but some of the functions are a step backwards imo.
 As an example, if I were to go give permissions to a shared mailbox, when I go to delegation and add, it completes and I have to close the window out, if I also need to apply send as permission, I have to go back into the mailbox to do so where in the &quot;classic&quot; admin center, everything can be done in the popup window without closing anything. This function is no longer available in the classic admin center.
 I know it&#x27;s a minor annoyance and yes, I do use powershell more often than not to accomplish some of these tasks, I know Microsoft is gonna Microsoft but some of the changes are just so annoying. I think things like message trace are better here but overall, I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking with some of the changes.

                              <span>So one of our agencies is getting a software from the company Axon. They will fill out a report and it will go to the Axon website. From there, Axon generates an XML and JSON file and wants to place those files on our network for other users to access so they can open the XML file and enter in data from it.
 Our Network team said this was impossible as Axon does not have anything that would connect it to our provate network. Axon says as long as a PC has internet access they could drop the files on a SFTP server here if we give them a user account for it. Our network team still said it was impossible even doing that because our SFTP server is a linux server.
 Who is correct here?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got users using various versions of outlook (some as old as 2010...) but they have periodically asked me if there&#x27;s some alternative to rebooting their computer to address extreme sluggishness in outlook (e.g., just clicking on a new message has a big delay).
 These computers have tons of available memory and and restarting the app doesn&#x27;t help so I suspect there&#x27;s some windows service I need to restart which outlook if relying on that is causing the issue.
 ​
 Do you know what service it is?
 I&#x27;d prefer not to tell people to reboot their whole computer to address this issue
 Thanks,
 IB

We&#x27;ve recently spun up a new MDT server and want to update the DHCP pool&#x27;s settings to redirect PxE requests to the new server. I&#x27;ve updated the ip helper-address settings for the VLANs interfaces and the &#x27;option 66&#x27; setting to point to the new server, but PxE boot requests are still being directed to the old server&#x27;s address. Does something need to be restarted or reloaded in order for the settings to take effect?

                              <span>Hello All,
 ​
 In the era of WFH and remote connections, I wanted to put this idea out to the community.
 ​
 What do you think of an auto-detecting VPN client? (or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)
 ​
 What I was thinking was:
  
The VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature
 When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect
 The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.
 Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can&#x27;t access a resource, only to find they haven&#x27;t connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice &quot;looks like you&#x27;re trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?&quot;
 The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)
  
​
 what do you guys think? let me know in the comments

                              <span>For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you&#x27;ll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I&#x27;ve ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don&#x27;t have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to &quot;Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired&quot; or similar. 
 If you&#x27;re familiar with Kari&#x27;s law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it&#x27;s a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says &quot;Sign in to make an emergency call&quot;
 How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they&#x27;re non compliant with Kari&#x27;s law? 
 What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn&#x27;t a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. 
 I get that there&#x27;s other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand &#x27;most people just use their cellphones&#x27;, but I&#x27;m specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there&#x27;s no way to be compliant with Kari&#x27;s law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it&#x27;s in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.

                              <span>Our organization has a mix of A1 and A3 licenses. Currently users have to change their password on prem and that sync to the cloud. We are considering enabling SSPR but couldn&#x27;t find what will happen if an A1 user attempts to change their password in the cloud? Will it be denied? Will it let them change it in the cloud but not sync back to our on prem server? Will it let them change it and sync back but technically they aren&#x27;t licensed to do so?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a networking guy, NOT a linux guy unfortunately so I&#x27;m coming at this from a very green position. We&#x27;ve used RANCID in the past but viewvc has been giving us fits for a while and Oxidized looks pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot.
 I installed it on Ubuntu and I got it to the point where oxidized is running as a service and I can see the configs it&#x27;s capturing but I&#x27;ve been unable to get nginx working to access it on the web. If I&#x27;m understanding it right (and I may not be), Oxidized is running a local web server on port 8888 and nginx is supposed to listen on port 80 (and 443) and then reverse proxys web traffic to the oxidized site.
 Right now when I go to the server on the web I get a 502 Bad Gateway message and I&#x27;m not sure what needs to change. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s something in the nginx.conf or sites-enabled/default files but I&#x27;m not sure.
 Here&#x27;s the current (sanitized) contents of my /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file: https://pastebin.com/Dx2jrEDU
 And here&#x27;s the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default: https://pastebin.com/KfGnJk16
 Like I said, I&#x27;m not a Linux guy so please take it easy on me :)

A 39-year-old Florida man pleaded guilty Tuesday to selling hundreds of millions of dollars of counterfeit Cisco gear to unsuspecting schools, hospitals, government agencies, and the military.
 According to the US Justice Department, between 2013 and 2022 Onur Aksoy, based in Miami, founded at least 19 companies in New Jersey and Florida and launched 15 Amazon and 10 eBay storefronts from which he peddled &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of low-quality or faulty networking devices gussied up to look like new or official Cisco equipment.
 The goods, imported from sellers in China and Hong Kong, were often loaded with pirated Cisco software and packaged within Cisco boxes bearing Cisco labels and stickers. Documentation was also made to look legitimate, the Justice Department said.
  
I&#x27;m sure it will only be a matter of time before some of the big name suppliers start using this guy as a scare tactic to funnel sales back their way.

 My question to my fellow sysadmins, what is the best path moving forward from here, as am not much into people management and utterly dismal in terms of documentation.
 Any pointers will help. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi All,I wanted to find out some information from others about how they manage their applications on Hybrid azure AD joined azure virtual desktop multisession VMS. Currently in a painful position where majority of the apps are deployed by PowerShell on start up, however keeping these applications updated is a sort of lets say semi manual process as new version of applications cannot be installed over the top, some applications for example teams machine wide have to be removed first etc. How are others doing it at present ?.

                              <span>Hi All.
 ​
 I have 4 domain controllers currently at domain functional level of 2008 and I have a number of VMS which run server 2016/19 and windows 10 21h2/22h2. I have recently noticed that our policy definitions are quite old and I wanted to find out what the best way is to update these and what is best practice to ensure none of the GPO&#x27;s breaks in the process. Is there anything which I need to be mindful of ? 
 ​
 Thank you all

 And the answer was, at a quick glance, pretty OK. (below). Given chatgpt&#x27;s ability to make plausible stuff up, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a great thing or aa world of pain lying in wait.
 When dealing with an oversized transaction log file in Microsoft SQL Server, the following steps can be taken to address the issue when the shrink command does not reduce the file size:
  
Check the database recovery model: Ensure that the database is in the full or bulk-logged recovery model. If it is set to the simple recovery model, the transaction log will not shrink.
 
Backup the transaction log: Create a backup of the transaction log using the BACK…</span>

 I go two folders up - &quot;../../&quot; Two folders inside to get the json file - &quot;../../Config/Dev/xxx-setting.json&quot;
 Using just - &quot;Config/Dev/xxx-setting.json&quot; would give me - &quot;Jwt settings file not found, hmac settings file not found. API key doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;
 But when I use &quot;../../Config/Dev/xxx-setting.json&quot;
 I get JWT setting file doesnt exist. Unhandled Exception. System.IO.FileNotFoundException.
  
and some error related to the application parsing? I am not sure.
  
What do you think is going wrong here and what can I do?

                              <span>Hey,
 I have a 2012R2 server (Last one in production with update planned prior to soon EOL) which still has Flash Active X installed. KB4577586 has been set to install in WSUS for all device groups and has installed succesfully on all other servers and endpoints. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried manually downloading from the Microsoft update catalog but when ran i&#x27;m told &quot;this update is not applicable on your computer&quot;.
 Anyone else had similar? Recent updates continue to install no issue including all monthly and the recent quarterly security roll-ups.

                              <span>Had a meetup with a friend from a previous job, one that I actually got to apply to the position via reddit, and he said he just got approved to block reddit starting on the 12th in the corporate firewall.
 I asked if he was only going to block it for a couple days as part of the blackout but apparently he got the permanent block approved by the VP. It won&#x27;t be accessible on their internal network or their guest wifi, and he&#x27;s expecting to piss off a few people with this change.
 We discussed setting similar blocks in our home networks for a couple days and seeing how we do - thought that might appeal to a few people here since it looks like this sub will be staying up. You might also consider setting up blocking at work as well if that&#x27;s plausible. I work for a giant megacorp so I&#x27;m not even going to try, but having worked at some small places it&#x27;s definitely something I would have put forth there.

                              <span>Recently I stumbled over the new features that Microsoft tries to implement in Windows and Office 365. 
 Especially the &quot;new&quot; Outlook app. The &quot;new&quot; app looks basically Outlook.office.com but as a Modern app. Most Add-Ins didn&#x27;t work like online and in general the app felt worse then the Web app. 
 A few days ago I heard in a webcast, that Microsoft probably does not continue the development of active directory which could result in an push towards Azure AD.
 Today I read about upcoming changes to the explorer and the &quot;Home menu&quot; looks like the start Menu from Microsoft 365. 
 This all feels like Microsoft wants to force users to get in touch with the existing cloud infrastructure and wants to push the cloud services more than only migrating Server VMs to azure. 
 This scenario is quite unrealistic, but I think this could be happening more in the future. 
 Does anybody feel the same way?

                              <span>My admin account is being brute force every day.
 They are failling because the IPs are marked as dangerous, its an simple password (not 2FA) and coming from a not allowed geography
 Is it possible to block it completely?

                              <span>Everybody hello,
 Wednesday, a recruiter cab called me to asks if I was potentially interested in new offers. I told yes, then he told me he has a DevOps offer. So, I am working as system &amp; network admin since 2.5 years in my company (its my first job, i&#x27;m 24). The thing is they were looking for an experienced DevOps, which im obviously not.
 So, they anyways wanted to meet me, yesterday eve I went to the company (~150 employees), they told me they were considering taking me as mid-time DevOps &amp; mid-time sysadmin at the beginning to help me getting skills on DevOps, and after some months if needed, I would be a full DevOps.
 The point is they have also needs on sysadmin side, and Im pretty much experimented on sysadmin, so all of this sounds fair to me, the business looks nice, great office, great work schedule, everything.
 Does this offer sounds really fair? Is it a redflag? Is there something I should really be care of? Whats you guys opinion on it? (I am really about to accept)

                              <span>hi there! 
 I have an issue with opendkim. The problem is that it allows emails without attachments from the sender, but it blocks emails with attachments from the same sender. The sender is using O365. It&#x27;s possible that the headers are changing somehow after the attachment is added, dunno. I tried adding the sender&#x27;s domain to the trusted host list, but the issue still persists.
 thoughts?

                              <span>Hi folks, I have been running a little website gathering some links I need daily.
 It&#x27;s made with Nginx, and using a Let&#x27;s Encrypt Certificate. 
 There was no issue since 9 months, but yesterday, Chrome is saying my website is unsafe, because of phishing and stuff. The certificate is not expired. 
 I used the Google support to see if this was an error, but I don&#x27;t have any answer yet.
 Has anyone of you ever got this problem?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have a question and I would like your advice and insight.
 I&#x27;ve been in it for 5+ years and I&#x27;m about to take my CCNA test. My current job, I have no access to the network and I have only been there for 5 months.
 So my question is: If I pass my CCNA test, should I start looking for a job that needs a network guy or stay for a year or two so employers don&#x27;t question why I&#x27;m hopping my job so fast? 
 Thanks for your advice
 Ps: my ultimate goals to be network security with azure administration sprinkled in.

 He asked me the other day about YouTubers he should follow to learn about IT concepts, learn about new tools, tutorials/how-to content, etc. He is eager to learn but has a hard time reading long form blogs and finds video content way more easier to digest. (Something about that generation…but I digress). I recommended NetworkChuck but need some more suggestions for him.
 Who are your favorite YouTubers to learn about IT stuff? He’s interesting in everything — networking, security, coding, devops, etc.

 First problem, if I am booted to WinServ2019Essentials, the WSB times out when looking for a backup on the USB drive.
 So I boot via USB and chose recover, it takes about 2 hours to scan the USB for a recovery file, it finds it and then when I say to execute it I get error &quot;The system restore has failed. No disk that can be used for recovery can be found&quot;
 Now the internet has a variety of answers, from WSB is deprecated and won&#x27;t work, all the way to attempting to partition and format the drives exactly as they were.
 Second issue, I don&#x27;t know how to determine how many partitions and exactly their sizes. 
 Can any of you syswizards help me out here?
 I am absolutely trying to avoid manually installing and rebuilding of the server due to so many 3rd party integrations and exe.

No, $5 more an hour still doesn&#x27;t get me interested in a job 1.5 hours drive away with zero benefits... Sorry bub. (The distance thing is because I live in the DFW Metroplex, and is an added annoyance that they never bother to even look on a map at what kind of drive I&#x27;d be making, and of course, most of those jobs are either 1 day from home or fully on-site) 
 I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re just scraping job sites and trying to make a quick buck, but does anyone go for these jobs?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve done a bit of googling about this but haven&#x27;t really gotten an answer I&#x27;m happy with.
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with Netbox to demo, and I&#x27;ve been importing our addressing and VLANs. My concern is with how VLANs are handled. It seems like it&#x27;s not possible to say &quot;vlan 1 is globally Desktops,&#x27; for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? 
 Right now I have (for example) a &quot;site_vlans&quot; vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual &quot;vlan 1&quot; assigned to each group/site. This is all well and good, but suppose you have 100 VLANs and 10 sites. Are you required to maintain 1000 VLAN records in Netbox? Seems unwieldy. 
 Thanks.

Spoke switches are a mix of older generation 3650, 3850, and newer 9300. One of the spoke legs is also its own hub in a separate building. This switch is a 9300X-24Y (24 x 25G SFP), and off of it has a mix of older 2960 and newer 9300-48Us. 
 For a while now we have received complaints about poor download speed from locations in this building.

                              <span>Happy Friday everyone, 
 So, I manage a hotel&#x27;s Wifi service. A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I&#x27;m getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I&#x27;m also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I&#x27;m assuming this is normal behavior you see when you&#x27;ve placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I&#x27;m not 100% on this. If not, let me know.
 When I&#x27;m on the casino floors, I&#x27;m getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel &amp; Casino), I&#x27;m also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.
 Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.
 This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas. I appreciate any thoughts and inputs you might have.
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am working in a company which develops safety-critical application. The company (railway operator) which uses our system in the field wants us to join their already deployed MPLS network. In this case, we need to share the network infrastructure with other systems like CCTV, IP phone etc. Otherwise we are going to install our closed loop for communication between control center and remote equipments, which is a general approach we have taken so far. Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.
 As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?
 Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?
 I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?
 The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don&#x27;t need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won&#x27;t need to worry for failures and maintenance.
 In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am hoping to get some feedback on how to improve my HA setup between my active/passive FortiGates, and a Cisco Nexus vPC pair acting as the layer3 core. 
 Here is the topology with relevant config:
 https://i.ibb.co/hcmxVTs/Forti-Gate-Nexus.png
 Each FortiGate has two interfaces configured in an aggregate (ports 2 and 4). FortiGate1&#x27;s ports 2 and 4 are plugged into Nexus1&#x27;s ports 1 and 2. The same is done for FortiGate2.
 When I added the second Nexus, I initially tried connecting port 2 from each FortiGate into the same Nexus, and port 4 from each FortiGate into the other. However, this caused unexpected behavior. I can&#x27;t exactly recall what happened, as there were a number of issues I was troubleshooting during this time.
 Fast forward a few months, I noticed Po5 was down on Nexus1, and Po4 was down on Nexus2. I removed these port channels and quickly realized this caused an outage.
 I have an opportunity for a maintenance window this weekend and would like to improve this setup if possible. Would anyone who has implemented a similar topology be willing to expand on their HA configuration?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I have a fairly simple network, outlined below. For the question in particular, two subnets in their own VLAN.
 I have a service running in VLAN1000, lets say it&#x27;s a webserver. I have forwarded 443/tcp from my WAN interface to this machine, and it works fine from the outside.
 From VLAN5, however, it doesn&#x27;t work properly. It requires either split horizon DNS or hairpin NAT. I&#x27;m currently using split horizon DNS, but that only works for machines were I can control DNS, which I can&#x27;t for some computers. It also doesn&#x27;t work with some services just using IPs.
 I&#x27;d like to implement a hairpin NAT rule which works with my dynamic WAN IP. I can&#x27;t find any relevant documentation on this, but I&#x27;m probably missing something obvious.
 How do I implement this?

                              <span>Update: Apparently I needed to enable PFS on both sides. It&#x27;s working now.
 I&#x27;ve been able to get a VPN tunnel established between an ASA 5555-X with Public Static IP Address and a Cisco RV320 which has a 4G LTE (Verizon) USB modem attached. It completes Phase 1 and Phase 2 setup of the VPN tunnel but I&#x27;m not getting any data to pass. The ASA side show #pkts encaps and #pkts encrypted counters increasing but the #pkts decaps never increase from 0.
 The RV320 shows its IP Address is 100.121.189.168, however that is not the IP I&#x27;m using to establish the tunnel. I&#x27;m using the address that I see when going to ipchicken.com. Of course, the RV320 doesn&#x27;t have the best debugging/logging capabilities.
 Any ideas if this is possible?

                              <span>We&#x27;re running into a serious headache trying to get our Clearpass to work with our Cisco Switches.
 As configured our older IOS switches work just fine, but we have a nagging problem that only affects our 3850s.
 Wondering if anyone knows what we are missing here...
 When trying to authenticate via EAP-TLS, it skips the 802.1x wired service policy and is processed by the MAC Auth service policy even though the service identifies that it has a cert issued by the internal CA

                              <span>My company is a large global corporation. We currently have aging Cisco switches and access points. My management is strongly considering Fortinet for switching and wireless. I have heard great things about Juniper/Mist from friends who have deployed it. Any insights into Fortinet switching and wireless. I know their firewalls are considered really good but have heard not so great things about their switches and APs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not exactly strong on networking so bare with me here please. 
 We have have a large list of subnets which have a list of contacts that are responsible for them. We have Infoblox for management, however, it does not support having specific groups/users for many different subnets. If there is an issue with a specific subnet a 3rd party contacts these groups/users to notify them about a problem with their subnet. What do you guys usually use or would recommend using for this? 
 We are currently looking at Nautobot as it supports Infoblox integration. But as far as I can tell it does not support users/groups for subnets either. Currently we are using an old database with basically all manual entry which is less than ideal. I don&#x27;t know if what I am asking makes any sense to you guys but if not then please ask for clarification. I appreciate any help I can get on this.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a networking guy, NOT a linux guy unfortunately so I&#x27;m coming at this from a very green position. We&#x27;ve used RANCID in the past but viewvc has been giving us fits for a while and Oxidized looks pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot.
 I installed it on Ubuntu and I got it to the point where oxidized is running as a service and I can see the configs it&#x27;s capturing but I&#x27;ve been unable to get nginx working to access it on the web. If I&#x27;m understanding it right (and I may not be), Oxidized is running a local web server on port 8888 and nginx is supposed to listen on port 80 (and 443) and then reverse proxys web traffic to the oxidized site.
 Right now when I go to the server on the web I get a 502 Bad Gateway message and I&#x27;m not sure what needs to change. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s something in the nginx.conf or sites-enabled/default files but I&#x27;m not sure.
 Here&#x27;s the current (sanitized) contents of my /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file: https://pastebin.com/Dx2jrEDU
 And here&#x27;s the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default: https://pastebin.com/KfGnJk16
 ​
 Like I said, I&#x27;m not a Linux guy so please take it easy on me :)

                              <span>Hey Folks!
 Looking for help of the collective group as something surely has to exist already for this…
 We have an operations team that is 24x7. They respond and action to various alerts. My team has developed very detailed process on how to respond to these alerts (ex. device down). The process is currently documented in a flow chart and we’re looking at next steps to bring this to our Operations Team.
 I’d love to be able to have something that is user input driven - I’m imagining something web-based that prompts them for Yes or No / Choice A or B type inputs and then leads them to the next steps.
 For example…device down…. Is there an active change being performed by the Network Team or vendor? (Yes/No). Based on the selection the next input would be something like… IF No… Is it a single device down or multiple… and so on.
 I’d love this format over something like an incredibly long word document with anchors.
 Here’s an example of something that I found - albeit maybe really out and outdated(?) - that paints a picture.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;ve got a route known via 2x different larger routes: 
 10.244.50.0 
 Known via 
 1) 10.0.0.0/8
 2) 10.0.0.0/16 
  
Both via EIGRP
 Both pointing to the same next hop address
 same AD for both (170 - external EIGRP)
 Same metric for both (25626112)
 Same ubest/mbest for both (2/0)
  
So I&#x27;m trying to determine why the /8 is preferred over the /16.

                              <span>Hello readers,
 I have a AS5400XM Gateway (old, very old, lol), that is currently password locked. There&#x27;s no documentation whatsoever. Whether it be online or at work. I use SuperPuTTy and am reverse SSH over an AYSYNC line. I have absolutely no idea as to why I&#x27;m not able to break into ROMMON, first off, the unit boots really fast lol, and second there is no text direction in the CLI telling me what break combination to use. 
 ​
 I have one last idea and that is am going to use reverse Telnet over the AYSYNC lines and use the &quot;Special Commands&quot; drop down in SuperPuTTy.
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated! 
 ​
 THANK YOU!!

 What monitoring software do you know of that supports/monitors Cloudgenix devices (Prisma SD-WAN)? That can also integrate with Cisco Meraki and Service Now.

                              <span>I feel like the last few years I’ve seen “Network Engineer” jobs become such a conglomeration of skills — everything from scripting to windows administration, SDN, Linux, MPLS and VPNs, all done by one person. Has anyone else been feeling lately like the career field is expanding as a side/additional skill set to Administration?

                              <span>Howdy folks, I’m a networking novice and just looking for some help troubleshooting an issue I’m having with the network I maintain/administrate for an event production company. Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. 
 Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. 
 The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs. Feel free to ask any questions about the setup that I may not have answered, I’m sure I missed some things. TIA.

                              <span>Can anyone recommend a good make of Serial console server to manage Cisco, Arista and Palo Alto devices. Up until now I have used Raritan, but they seem to be completely unable to deliver any devices. I ordered several over a year ago, and they keep pushing back the delivery date, so I am looking for an alternate.
 I would like them to have dual LAN ports for resilience, Dual PSU and connect to the Console port using a standard CAT5 with no adapters. Up to 48 ports.

                              <span>from what i&#x27;ve seen on a bgp intro, when setting up bgp you need a /24 to advertise. We already have 3x /24 public IP blocks on hand but some of those IPs have servers assigned to them already. my question is, do i still need to acquire another /24 block just for bgp use or can we use what we currently have? i guess i&#x27;m stuck on the &#x27;advertise&#x27; part. my thinking is we&#x27;re advertising routes a&#x27;la ospf, but to the world this time. 
 i apologize if this sounds elementary. i&#x27;m working with a contractor overseas so i&#x27;m basically the remote hands and in charge of fulfilling requirements, etc. this is my first time working on bgp as you can tell.

 ​
  
Advertise 1st /24 + /23 ISP-A
 Advertise 2nd /24 + /23 ISP-B
  
Would the longest match prefix rule be considered ahead of BGP best path ? In this scenarios ISP-A is Cogent and ISP-B is Lumen. Would advertising the /23 provide failover in the event one side was lost ? One last thought, would the IP range being owned by the end user vs it being leased from a providers range impact this. Say you leased the /23 via Lumen and its part of /16 supernet they advertise via their own AS. This is just a hypothetical although I did once see something similar to this in production and did not have chance to verify if it actually worked as intended.
 ## ISP A - BGP # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.0.0/24 30.0.0.0/23 ## ISP B - BGP ## # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.1.0/24 30.0.0.0/23

                              <span>Looking to replace a Netgear GS748Tv4H1 switch that&#x27;s been in production since 2012. It has worked well (with the exception of a fan replacement a few years ago) but I recently deployed a new batch of workstations that have Intel i225/226 ethernet ports. For some unexplained reason, these computers will show &quot;Network disconnected&quot; unless I manually set the link speed to 10Mb. My troubleshooting process has narrowed it down to some issue with the Netgear switch. Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC&#x27;s with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.
 No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I&#x27;ve come up with these:
 Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)
 FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I&#x27;m leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I&#x27;m just wondering if I&#x27;m getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don&#x27;t need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn&#x27;t want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn&#x27;t get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they&#x27;re ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I&#x27;m getting everything I need?

                              <span>Hello, my org is in a highly regulated industry, and we have a parent company that manages and is responsible for the WAN network for all companies like ours.
 They will not provide us a list of devices and firmwares and instead work with auditors directly. It is kind of crazy.
 But the question I have is all of our 20 or so locations have ancient dumb Cisco ISRs (1900s I believe) - these are all on a MPLS network that go to some kind of Fortinet gateway in their data center.
 Each location has a simple flat VLAN (they refuse to budge on this), so these devices don&#x27;t really do any routing, the gateway/MPLS would handle all of that.
 Still I am wondering what kind of vulnerablities or risks this might bring.
 We and other orgs are leaving them for a SD-WAN+ZTNA/Zscaler setup, but that won&#x27;t be for some time.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Long story short, I&#x27;ve received a SNMP-related task and don&#x27;t really know how to conclude it. I don&#x27;t have a networking background, I&#x27;m mostly a programmer. I&#x27;m running Oracle Linux, for info. 
 I need to implement SNMP v3 communication between the user and an agent, which I was able to do and is working as expected. I would like to add an extra layer of security using certificates, and this is the part that I am having issues with. I can generate and sign the certificates just fine, but what should be the content of snmpd.conf? It seems that all I try, the SNMP commands work either with or without the certificates, and I&#x27;m not able to find a conclusive example. I feel I&#x27;m missing something, any thoughts?

 If you have used BMC remedy, what are your experience with it? The whole system and layout seems outdated. I do know they used to be a big name years ago?

I am reminding myself of the various switches that make DCDIAG spit out useful things and in the course of doing so, stumbled on documentation about ADREPLSTATUS which looks like a handy-dandy tool for just this kind of thing. 
 But, as Murphy would have it, Microsoft&#x27;s article about it opens with:

 Talk about timing! 
 Has anyone got an alternate source I can grab this..... oh, nevermind.... I see there&#x27;s a MSFT engineer that has decided to take it on as a personal project. I was about to delete his whole post and score one more point for good ole rubber-duck troubleshooting, but I guess maybe someone might find it ss useful to leave a breadcrumb trail to point here:

 I had on my calendar to do this in August around the 3-month mark but with the uncertainty of my continued presence on reddit I&#x27;m going to do it now. 
 I realize I&#x27;m still in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase but so far I&#x27;m loving every aspect of the new role. The hours are flexible, my boss and the team is amazing, I&#x27;m learning a ton, and possibly most of all am taking a huge step forward in my career.
 I won&#x27;t say there haven&#x27;t been challenges, going from a company of 80 to one of 350k means a lot of bureaucracy. Still waiting for some higher-level access to my laptop but at least I have an Azure VM I can work in with full admin rights. 
 I will also note, probably unsurprisingly, this is the first week I&#x27;ve felt like I can actually contribute to the team. I setup an Azure VM for one of the offshore folks and was able to do a DB restore and push to Azure SQL for some mock data.
 Anyway, yeah that&#x27;s about it at the moment. Happy to answer questions if I can without doxing myself and all that happy crap.
 Oh, and I will re-iterate from the last time, the outpouring of support from this community was amazing and I truly appreciated all the positive comments and good will. 
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin!
 I have been tasked to write up an “IT Security Overview” to educate a potential new insurer. I have an idea where to start but I could easily make it way to complicated. I am good at that. My idea is to focus it at c-level execs so I can use it for more than one purpose. 
 Some Items I want to include but not limited to
  
 VPN vendor 
  vendor list in general
  MFA status on all services (internal and external)
  Server and Windows Versions
  what outdated software/hardware we have (none)
  Our backup strat (mediums, encryption, testing schedule)
  potentially ACLs on VLANs and VPNs?
  past infections/any data loss (none)
  software update schedule 
 maybe even as far as what firewalls we use. 
  
Does anyone have any other thoughts?
 thanks for listening!

                              <span>Yesterday, I was managing multiple systems using remote desktop. The desktop I had to use only had one monitor so I had to keep switching between my local desktop and the remote desktop windows. A really annoying issue with this type of setup is using keyboard shortcuts (combinations) in windowed mode for remote desktop is the short cut (i.e. Window+R, Windows+E, etc...)would apply to the local desktop instead of the remote host.
 So I decided to take a look at the advanced settings for RDP and found a setting that I don&#x27;t remember being there last time I looked (many years ago), and under &quot;Local Resources&quot; &gt; &quot;Apply Windows key combinations&quot; was the solution to this annoying issue. There you can select the option to apply the keyboard shortcuts/combinations to the remote computer, instead of &quot;Only when using the full screen&quot;.
 I figured I would share, because I mentioned this to some of my teammates and they didn&#x27;t know about this setting either.
 Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold award!

                              <span>Fun story for the day:
 I was looking at the networked devices the other day at work and came across a Chevy Suburban hopping between access points. My two thoughts were, &quot;I really need to change the Wi-Fi password&quot; and &quot;Cars can connect to Wi-Fi now?&quot; I blocked it from the network without a second thought.
 Today I get a ticket in saying, &quot;If you have the time today, my picture frame isn’t on the wifi anymore.
 I was just wondering if you could fix it.&quot; I tried throwing in the password to no avail. It just wouldn&#x27;t take. I reset the device, turned Wi-Fi off, nothing. It finally clicked that the digital picture frame was being listed as a Chevy Suburban in my connected devices! It was a quick switch to unblock it, and I got a nice lesson in Don&#x27;t do stuff without knowing what you&#x27;re doing.

ACTION NOTICE: Impacted ESG appliances must be immediately replaced regardless of patch version level. If you have not replaced your appliance after receiving notice in your UI, contact support now 
 Barracuda’s remediation recommendation at this time is full replacement of the impacted ESG.
  
I wonder how deep the malware hit if a restore from backups / factory reflash wouldn&#x27;t be enough.

                              <span>We have a Windows Server 2003 running on a physical machine in an AD environment with about 150 users. The server needs to be retired and I need a way to copy over all 18 TB of data to a new machine. My options are migrating the data to either a new Windows Server or a Synology NAS.
 The old server has only about 1 TB of space left, so P2V tools like disk2vhd wouldn&#x27;t work (assuming that the VM has to created on the server itself). Veeam is also not an option, since its client doesn&#x27;t support the old OS. I looked into Synology&#x27;s &quot;Active Backup for Business&quot;, but I&#x27;ve never used it and I&#x27;m not sure if it would work.
 What do you think is the best option? I&#x27;d really appreciate some advice.

                              <span>In short, my job restricts connections through VPN and I&#x27;m trying to circumvent this without being detected.
 My reasoning is that commercial VPNs, like NordVPN or others won&#x27;t work, as they typically have the same IP addresses and can be detected that way.
 The home VPN, however, should in theory not be distinguishable from a &quot;regular&quot; connection.
 Is my assumption correct, or are there other factors that could give out the information that a user is connected through a VPN?

                              <span>I used the Diceware method to create my master password. It suggested I also add a memorable number to the end of my password so I decided to just put my current age. For some reason, finally using a password manager felt like a big moment. I remember making that password vividly. I remember exactly where I was, what the furniture looked like, etc.
 Now every day when I enter my master password I realize how much time has passed. I&#x27;m coming up on a decade since and every time I get further from that number, my mortality sets in. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been a decade from that point in time. I would not recommend it.
 Which brings me to my main question; how often do you change your master password if at all? Any system for doing so?

                              <span>Hello fellows sysadmins, Do some Android or iOS system based device exist with the possibility to install apps from the store? I&#x27;m working as an MSP and really fed up with all the vendors forcing us to install their MFA apps. 
 I don&#x27;t want to install dozen of apps doing just random TOTP or push notification on my personal phone. I&#x27;m using hardware token (YubiKey) on everything that can accept it but there is always exception. 
 I could just buy a second phone for this purpose but I think it&#x27;s a bit overkill and didn&#x27;t find any Android based device for this purpose. Do you know something similar?

                              <span>My head of security wants to explore virtual desktops specifically for contractors, to reduce the need for us to ship expensive laptops to contractors that require access to company systems, which is what we&#x27;re doing now.
 I haven&#x27;t explored the VDI space in about 10 years, though I&#x27;m familiar with some of the more common solutions like Windows 365 and VMWare. However I haven&#x27;t worked with any of them or tested any of their offerings recently.
 The basic idea is that these contractors don&#x27;t need a specific operating system since almost all of our services are web based, and we&#x27;d issue them a low(er) cost device like a Chromebook in lieu of a Macbook if they actually needed hardware, or they could access the VM securely via a personal computer.
 Can anyone comment on modern solutions?

                              <span>We have a couple of IIS websites (intranet on Sharepoint and ADFS for Dynamics 365) running in our on-prem AD environment. Up until recently SSO from browsers such as Chrome and Edge was functioning properly.
 Now all of a sudden several users are complaining that SSO does not work, regardless of using Chrome or Edge. It doesn&#x27;t matter which user logs on to the computer, SSO still will not work, and the user has to type in username and password.
 If we run &quot;gpupdate /force /target:computer&quot; on the problematic computer, SSO works just fine.
 If user restarts computer the same problem occurs again, until &quot;gpupdate /force /target:computer&quot; is run again.
 Configuration is correct,
  
Integrated Windows Authentication is enabled
 
Automatic logon only in Intranet zone is enabled on the Intranet zone settings (user settings GPO)
 
The urls of the websites belong to the intranet zone
 
 Does anyone know what could be causing this intermittent fall out of SSO, or if there are tools that can be used to troubleshoot/log the reason why it&#x27;s not working, when it stops working? 
 Clients are running Win10 Enterprise 21H2.

                              <span>As with a lot of businesses, we are using O365 that is synced to our local AD structure. We also have all accounts protected with MFA.
 We have have recently have had the honor of dealing with someone (probably a script) trying to compromise a couple of C level users. As sole IT, it makes it hard on me because it is constantly locking out these two users and I am unlocking them 3 or 4 times a day. One user&#x27;s attack lasted maybe 3 or 4 days before they quit. The other user&#x27;s attack has been going on for over a week. It was constant for the first few days but has waned a bit recently. 
 What do you guys do when this happens? Anything I can do to cut down the downtime these users are experiencing as a result?

                              <span>I am a one man IT department in a new to me organization. I’m looking into RMM solution for remote monitoring/access, patch management, and endpoint security. 
 The most important piece to me would be the reliability of their patch management software. 
 I have trialed Ninja, Syncro, Pulseway, N-Central, and Atera. 
 However, I can’t find an up-to-date reviews of the platforms. Most of the ratings are 2+ plus years old in and I know much can change in that given time. 
 Does anyone here at sysadmin have any recommendations?

 I&#x27;ve never used this backup software before, so just checking if it&#x27;s a solid option to keep using, or if I should be pushing to replace it with something like Veeam? Anyone have experience with it?

 Have a client that houses people with mental health conditions. Some of those people have suffered through scams ending with them losing thousands of dollars to people pretending to be women. 
 Asking here and a few other places. 
 Do you know of any resources or technology that could help prevent or react to this type of situation? 
 They&#x27;re using personal devices on a personal network with little supervision. Don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a technical answer here or if we&#x27;re just stuck with reinforcing on the social side.

 After years of battling with the Marketing/Graphic department and their 20 To of data. I installed Photoprism in Docker and showed the Manager the logic of looking for a tool instead of our flat file server windows 2019. the file server have a basic setup, shares, NTFS, and a lot of folders et sub folders. lots of duplicates...
 Ideally:
 selfhosted software
 open source able to connect to the NTFS share to index
 multi users with rights access
 capable of handling videos, pictures, RAW photo format, adobe suite format
 auto tagging, duplicate finding tool, poll system, etc etc
 project management solution or link available with one? ( i know it exist some software special for marketing people where they can push automatically their photoshop (adobe suite) file to a portal and create workflow for approval by the other teams 
 thanks a lot for any idea

                              <span>Hey all, having a bit of trouble finding documentation around this. Is anyone aware what authentication method hp scanners use, ntlm or Kerberos?
 I did find some document around hp security and it referenced Kerberos but not specifically for the scanjet scanners.
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Hey folks,
 recently set up a VPS server with Windows Server 2022 featuring 8 CPU Threads, 8GB RAM.
 Using it for trading and stuff, so nothing wild performance wise, this is also reflected in the task manager with around 20-30% CPU usage and 50-60% RAM usage.
 But nonetheless, if accessed via MS RDP, it&#x27;s almost unusably unresponsive and laggy. Sometimes things don&#x27;t react to mouse clicks at all but as I said, the apps and stuff run smoothly, it&#x27;s only the GUI.
 Is this a limitation of RDP, are 3rd party apps more suitable (like AnyDesk, TeamViewer and stuff). Or can RDP be tuned?
 Internet connections are fast (100 and 400 Mbit&#x27;s for me and server) and the server is not too far away from me.
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hello guys! i don&#x27;t know if this is the super-right place to writhe this down, but i&#x27;m out of options and need some help, and you guys are always amazing.
 we have a fairly simple configuration for Kuberntes ingress: aws alb receive in 443, forward to 80, and then move traffic to nginx ingress controllers that has services on the 80.
 up until now i never had a problem like this one, snipeit its driving me crazy, the only thing i can get from its ingress is a gateway timeout, and this happens only for its url, all the other applications are working
 log from the ingress controller:
 networking nginx-ingress-nginx-controller-x7j7v controller 2023/06/08 10:50:09 [error] 857#857: *22661 upstream timed out (110: Operation timed out) while connecting to upstream, client: client, server: snipeit.staging.k8s.domain, request: &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1&quot;, upstream: &quot;upstream&quot;, host: &quot;snipeit.staging.k8s.domain&quot; 
 pod of snipeit doesnt log anything sadly, im using the latest image since i have ARM cluster.
 thats my &quot;proxy&quot; configuration for snipeit, but i tested really almost everything and im starting to thing is a strange combo.
 APP_ALLOW_INSECURE_HOSTS: &quot;true&quot; APP_FORCE_TLS: &quot;true&quot; APP_TRUSTED_PROXIES: &quot;**&quot; APP_LOG_LEVEL: &quot;debug&quot; SECURE_COOKIES: &quot;true&quot; APP_URL: &quot;https://snipeit.staging.k8s.domain&quot; 
 here the ingress configuration:
 ingress: 
 annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: &quot;120&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | more_set_headers &quot;X-Forwarded-Proto: https&quot;; path: / hosts: - snipeit.staging.k8s.jointly.pro pathType: Prefix
 also for refernce im using this chart. ; thank you in advance for whatever info you have.
 Really.

 Company wants us to only buy printers with a TPM2.0 chip, even small desk printers without a hard drive. My understanding is the TPM-chip only provides encryption to hard drives and that it won’t be any point of having one in a small disk less printer…?

 I&#x27;m looking into moving most of our project files into the cloud but after googling a bit it looks like a 50/50 risk where latency will be an issue because of how large they are. I bumped into azure file sync and wondering if anyone here has any success/fail experience with that? Also any testimonies where going to Azure for Autodesk programs would be great. FYI we do use bim collaborative for all new projects but have a lot of legacy projects that mgmt refuse to move over.

I&#x27;m currently working on a graduation project at my workplace, focusing on maintaining manageable yet secure remote access (RDP) connections for our support team. Our software company utilizes server providers or allows customers to host our software on their own servers. As we work with six different cloud server providers for our SaaS solution, connecting to these servers for support and software implementation is essential.
 To ensure the security of server connections, many of our (self-hosting)customers require MFA/2FA for all server access, including our own SaaS hosted customers. While we understand and appreciate their concerns, it presents a challenge for our support team since they connect to approximately 100 different customers each day. The repeated MFA prompts…</span>

                              <span>Would appreciate any help with this one.
 It is the first time I have looked at the switch (SG-500-52) since joining the company and the current manager doesn&#x27;t know the password. We don&#x27;t have any records for it. As a result, I am trying to run through the password recovery process.
 I am connected via DB9 into switch console port, DB9 to USB adapter into laptop. The adapter shows up as COM3 on device manager. I have followed the instructions for the baud rate, data bits etc but everytime I connect via Putty I just get a black screen.
 COM3 shows at the top and if I unplug the cable I get an error message. I have tried multiple different baud rates and a couple different drivers for the adapter cable but no luck.
 The only other thing I can think of trying is power cycling the switch whilst connected but I am not allowed to do that during office hours. Any ideas besides this?

                              <span>Hi community, 
 thanks for reading!
 I have an application running on a Windows Server with does not support any authentication at all. Therefore I build an IIS reverse proxy in front of it which is using Windows authentication. Everything worked fine until a new addon was installed to the application. Now, I am always sent back to the Windows authentication pop up when trying to open the addon page and gives me a 401 error although entering the right credentials. For me it looks like there is some kind of username / password coming with the link to the new module which kills my authentication.
 As soon as I change IIS from Windows authentication to Anonymous authentication it works.
 Here are the IIS logs (anonymized)

                              <span>So what I&#x27;m looking for is something that emulates the functionality of say MDT or FOG Project but that&#x27;s entirely mobile, can be run from bootable media/local storage and doesn&#x27;t require a server-side application that client devices have to interface with (preferably, the image files can be stored anywhere and then copied to storage media that is connected to the devices that require imaging).
 This would be used exclusively for imaging devices with Windows 10/11 Pro and customising the images to include the usual suite of client/environment specific additions: drivers, applications, Windows configuration, etc.
 The closest solution I can think of is NTLite but this product goes WAY back and I have no idea whether it&#x27;s at all relevant, well-supported, still works with Windows 11 and there are security concerns with tools like these given most of them are closed-source. Also, from what I can tell it&#x27;s exclusively an image-editing solution, so the imaging part of the process still has to be done manually via making bootable USB drives with Rufus for example. I don&#x27;t believe there are any similar solutions out there that can for example, image devices on the same network from a image repository stored on local storage?
 We have a number of clients with no on-prem server hardware that have fairly unique, extensively-customised OS images with a plethora of industry-specific software on top of that, and they are an absolute time-sink to reimage whenever one of their PCs/laptops is having issues and/or they purchase new hardware.

 /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_centreon_nrpe -H X.X.X.X -p 5666 -t 120 -u -m 8192 -c check_centreon_plugins -a &#x27;apps::backup::veeam::local::plugin&#x27; &#x27;job-status&#x27; &#x27; --filter-name&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --filter-start-time&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --filter-end-time&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --filter-counters&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --ok-status&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --warning-status&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --critical-status&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --warning-long&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --critical-long&#x3D;&quot;&quot; &#x27;
 The result : 
 Status information CHECK_NRPE: Received 0 bytes from daemon. Check the remote server logs for error messages.
 The snmpwalk work from my poller to the vm. I can telnet the VM from the poller on the 5666 port.
 I tried looking on the web but i don&#x27;t find any solution directly related to centreon so i don&#x27;t find any good solution. Thanks you all.

                              <span>Good morning
 This is a real long shot, I&#x27;m at the end of all my support options! Banging my head against the wall because I am clearly missing something obvious.
 I have two ASAv&#x27;s in different locations, both with the same split tunneling setup. We have a internet based service that we use OKTA for Authentication and recently implemented a CA policy to restrict out bound networks from accessing.
 What we have discovered is that Location A seems to show OKTA our DC Public IP, Location B it see&#x27;s their personal public IP.
 If you have a corporate IP you are routed internally to an on-prem appliance to authenticate. This doesn&#x27;t happen in the other location, you are simply blocked.
 If my route of traffic is to an external internet based application surely OKTA wouldn&#x27;t see my corporate DC IP. So how on earth does it manage to?!
 Gosh please help, tried explaining this to OKTA and got nowhere,

                              <span>Hi all,
 Currently we have unifi in the uk, but across the rest of our sites in europe we are using meraki.
 In one of our uk sites we have 30 unifi access points and we plan to add another 10, however we would like to move to meraki eventually.
 If i put 10 meraki ap&#x27;s into the uk site and configure them the same as the unifi (ssid&#x27;s, vlans etc) will i have performance issues?
 we don&#x27;t have the budget to do a full lift and shift, so it would have to be staged if this will work.

                              <span>Been evaluating DMARC recently, and I couldn&#x27;t find much information to help guide me when comparing options. So I tried to write down my thoughts in a way I would have found useful. I hope someone on here gets a bit of value out of it.
 A few observations is that there is a huge disparity between bottom range vendors and top range vendors in terms of price, and that there is a corresponding disparity in terms of tool functionality and Trust-center maturity. Top tier vendors offer some cool functions, but the increase in price was hardly worth it.
 Common DMARC vendor problems
 Common problems among nearly all DMARC vendors we spoke to (with 1 exception) was that they all had a hard time giving us a fixed quote, claiming that they needed to run a PoC/Trial to analyze our volumes before bei…</span>

I have been looking at e.g. Logitech Meetup USB Webcam 4K Ultra HD and its corresponding microphone, but I don&#x27;t really know if it is good or bad. Any suggestions?

 I am trying to create a PS script that will ask for UNC path to a shared folder, and compare 2 users to extract which security group allows them access to it. 
 I dont really have much experience with PS, so i&#x27;ve turned to AI to help me write the scripts, but its not working properly. 
 For testing purposes i took location and 2 person for who i know how gain access to said location, but the scripts returns result that they are not members of the same group (Even when they are). 
 This is what i made so far: 
 # Prompt for shared folder location
 $sharedFolder &#x3D; Read-Host &quot;Enter the path of the shared folder (e.g., \\server\share):&quot;
 # Prompt for user emails
 $user1Email &#x3D; Read-Host &quot;Enter the email address of the first user:&quot;

                              <span>Hello,
 I am looking for free alternatives to Anydesk and Chrome remote desktop. Teamviewer says I should buy a license because I use it often. Anydesk is pretty robust but there is a noticeable lag, which I don&#x27;t see on Chrome remote desktop. Unfortunately, one of my computers is connected to an new network where I can connect only through proxy. Chrome remote desktop doesn&#x27;t have an option for proxy manipulation and changing it through the whole system didn&#x27;t work either. 
 I tried NoMachine but I kept getting problems with the proxy. I gave up since I saw a lot of negative reviews about being slow.

                              <span>Odd question but googling has left me with no answers. 
 We currently have O365 and force MFA on every account. Users have downloaded the Microsoft Authenticator app and have added name@companydomain.com to it. 
 Works just fine for logging into O365
 We are about to roll out MFA to the new payroll system but in testing when adding the account via QR code (name@companydomain.com is the login) a second account in the Authenticator is not created and now the onetime passcode that cycles for that account works in both O365 AND the payroll system. 
 How and why?
 If I force a re-registration on O365 it breaks the payroll MFA
 If the user deletes the account from the Authenticator and adds it back it breaks the payroll MFA.
 I would think the onetime code for O365 and payroll system would be different unless they are somehow communicating. 
 Side note: there’s ZERO integration between the two systems. One is managed and maintained by HR and the other is IT.

 Having issues with 802.1x crapping out so would downgrade from 09.0.10c to the recommended 08.0.95j release?

                              <span>So tonight, I just didn&#x27;t upgrade from a C3750x to a C9300 and I basically copied the config from the 3750 to the 9300, other then the trunk. Long story short the 9300 wasn&#x27;t about to find its way out of the network the core switch at the site could ping the 9300. They were directly connected via fiber. The 9300 didn&#x27;t work until I added a static route to the core switch. &quot;ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 &quot;core ip&quot; &quot;. My qestuon is why I do i need to add the default route when I already programmed a default gateway on the 9300. The 3750 has no issues with understand the exit point but 9300 needs that static route when it&#x27;s only a layer 2 device.

                              <span>I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. 
 I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. 
 I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. 
 Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered &quot;over-engineered&quot; for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill. But, otherwise as you start to grow you NEED to take these things into a consideration otherwise it becomes a mess.

                              <span>Curious on everyones perspective for this. 
 Do you filter what your guest network has access to via Web/URL filtering,, DNS, IPS, App, etc?
 Do you throttle it?
 Do you give it a local DNS server to reference?
 Fire away!

 Compare that with a hot skill like kubernetes. Idk, any money in learning this stuff? 
 Hope you folks can share your experiences.

                              <span>Hi, sooo, yesterday I got burned really really badly on a Palo Alto pair that I&#x27;m migrating traffic across to. Long story short, it was a mistake my end, I had a NAT rule where I wanted it to NAT to the interface address of the outside interface and I had it built like this....
 Original Packet: Src Zone: Inside Dst Zone: Outside Dst Int: e1/1 Scr Address: entire 10/8 range Dst address: any
 Translated Packet: Src Translation: dynamic-ip-and-port Address-object for outside interface IP Dst address Translation: any
 The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I&#x27;m guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!
 What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That&#x27;s what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!
 I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should&#x27;ve done instead?
 The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!
 Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?
 The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP&#x27;s and they&#x27;re currently live on the ASA&#x27;s, so I can&#x27;t enable those specific ones on the PA&#x27;s yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM&#x27;s in one of the lower end environments

                              <span>I am trying to set up a lab on Eve-Ng to learn Network Automation with Ansible.
 I already have a Linux Server with Ubuntu image and can ping to the routers with the Cisco Vios image.
 The issue is that I am getting this error, % Unrecognized command
 when trying to run
 R1(config)#crypto key generate rsa modulus
 However, this is a recognized command on the Cisco Vios or the switch but not the router image.
 Is this an issue with Cisco vios image (vios-adventerprisek9-m.spa.159-3)?
 Is there another Cisco router image that is recommended to enable ssh?
 Thank you ! Any help is appreciated!!

                              <span>On an existing Cisco BGP configuration I want to add a new BGP peer as backup and remove an old one:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 68.68.68.68 remote-as 7777 neighbor 68.68.68.68 description peer2 neighbor 68.68.68.68 ebgp-multihop 255 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 68.68.68.68 activate neighbor 68.68.68.68 weight 100 neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family ! ip prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK seq 5 permit 9.9.9.0/24 ! ip prefix-list default-route seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0 ! ip prefix-list deny-all seq 5 deny 0.0.0.0/0 
 Removing 68.68.68.68 and adding 12.12.12.12 it would look something like this:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 12.12.12.12 remote-as 7777 neighbor 12.12.12.12 description peer2 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 12.12.12.12 activate neighbor 12.12.12.12 weight 200 neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family 
 Questions: 
 Why does only the primary peer has &quot;prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out&quot; is this a misconfiguration on the original setup that missed the advertised block on the secondary peer?
 Same question for &quot;prefix-list deny-all out&quot; on the backup peer
 Shouldn&#x27;t both neighbors have the same config except for weight (300 for primary)?
 EDIT Forgot to add, the new peer is directly connected and shouldn&#x27;t need multihop so I removed that line

                              <span>My office was destroyed by a tornado and I need to rebuild the network infrastructure. a brother of mine that is new to cybersecurity is proposing that I use a PfSense firewall. With Unifi switches and AP&#x27;s. We used to have old cisco switches with a pix firewall.
 Another direction I am being pushed toward is using a Cisco ASA with &quot;Cisco Business&quot; switches.
 For unifi I am concerned about the ability to properly segment the network especially if Layer 3 functionality is required.
 We will need separation for a few things.
  
Keycard entry/door controller. This will only want internet when updates are necessary.
 Security camera VLAN for cameras and DVR.
 VLAN for Employee PCs Laptops Phones.
 Guest VLAN for Guest Wifi
 Possibly an IOT VLAN? (if not placed on the other guest network.) for the Thermostats, Ring Devices Etc.
  
Will Ubiquity/Unifi be able to handle this and keep it secure? Anything I should be concerned about or aware of?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Deep (quick?) question! I’m trying to size servers to host a network monitoring solution and I need to « guestimate » how many sessions per second (on average) you can see going through a 10GBit/s (RX/TX &#x3D; both direction between two IP addresses, whatever the protocols over that) in an ISP network, a small Data Center network and the network of a Large Enterprise. I know it heavily depends on how many equipments are behind those, but… 🤷🏻‍♂️ - I’m starving for real life data ;-)
 And I know every network is different, but that would help me a lot if you could quote average and peak usages for those kind of networks you might have seen on 10G or even a 25G or 40G network (both North-South and East-West). 
 I looked at research papers, but… I just couldn’t find anything useful. Sometimes I find data on flows per second… but that’s not the same thing and extrapolating numbers isn’t really easy. 
 Can someone (or several someone) help me out on this one or point me to the right direction/ressource?

Since CEF is Cisco proprietary, I&#x27;m curious if other brands have their own proprietary forwarding protocols, or if it&#x27;s gone a similar route to EIGRP and OSPF, where the other brands use pretty much the same forwarding protocols.

 i&#x27;m having some doubts about configuring QoS on a Nexus3000 C3064PQ with NX-OS 7.x 
 I have two SVI, A and B
 A is my WAN, B is my LAN Gateway (with HSRP)
 A is allowed on Po100 which is the vPC used as WAN 
 I need to configure shape average only on WAN side (will it be via ACL on Po100, or via the whole SVI A, for my duties, is the same), but I find it difficult to understand which is the right way to do so, I&#x27;ve found controversial info in this field, and I&#x27;ll try to resume it to those 2 solutions: 
 Solution 1: Apply global policies and then apply a more specific on Po100

                              <span>Hi guys,
 We are in a such situation that Aruba TAC basically made everything worse so far.
 We have a customer case that made bracnch users to can&#x27;t take IP from DC.
 Long story short, I saw there is L2 tunnels between branch and DC clusters. Since the team that commissioned this have no idea about loops, cluster *tunnels* had no redundancy, and one branch cluster member at a time can&#x27;t connect to DC.
 TAC made tunnel redundancy with full mesh tunnels. No VRRP used anywhere. The problem is since SSID VLAN connected to same L2 domain, network has now big problem, loop.
 I&#x27;m looking for solution, since branch load balancing has no issues so far, and SSID not bridge on branch, we need solution for DC side.
 What do you think about ,we should use Aruba tunnel groups, Branch primary tunnels goes to physical address of first DC cluste member and secondary goes to second cluster member.
 Or
 We just use VRRP for branch destination and DC source. I saw a Airheads post about VRRP standby never use this tunnel unless VRRP active realy goes down. So far no loops.
 Any help would be appreciated

 These devices are constantly on the network sending out information to an application. At one of the facilities, the device stopped sending info. So of course we get called. We cannot ping it, can&#x27;t access the web interface, nothing. The screen on the device itself is still showing good info, it&#x27;s just not sending it over the network anymore. We get the person on-site to reboot it and it came back up.

 Well then it started happening more and more. This facility is a LONG way from the central office and this now malfunctioning device is quite important. We sent someone on site with a fluke to certify the runs…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m in the middle of a migration to 2 pairs of 3220&#x27;s, one pair for outbound and another for hosted.
 I&#x27;ve created the necessary layer 7 profiles, my question is, what and where would be the best places to apply them?
 At the moment, I&#x27;m thinking about putting only the URL based ones on outbound &quot;any&quot; rules and leaving the Anti Virus, Spyware and Vulnerability profiles off since logically they&#x27;re only really meant for inbound attacks? I guess you could make a case for potential filed that are downloaded and thus the Anti Virus profile would be useful then. Initially I did think about apply all 4 mentioned above there to &quot;any&quot; rules and have the same 3 applied to any rules coming in on the hosted firewalls.
 What are generally, the best ways to do it in everyone&#x27;s opinion?
 Thanks

 Then after we hit submit error: &quot;Failed to save configuration Integration encountered an error. Unalbe to authenticate with provided administrator credentials. Check the destination and credentials and try again.&quot;
 Problem is, I don&#x27;t know where the error is... NNMI creds, logger host info, or logger creds? I have tried multiple credentials that have admin rights and again, I can login to each of these components themselves using the credentials.

                              <span>Hello I have a quick question about NTP. 
 I have a router set up t get time from and upstream router ad they are sync&#x27;d up at a Stratum 2. 
 I am trying to get all my servers below my router to point to my router as their time source. Would I need to have the &quot;ntp master&quot; command in my router so the servers will be able to get the time from my router?
 ​
 This is a Cisco shop with Windows 2019 servers
 I have the ntp keys and the servers configured on my router as well as the ntp source which is my loopback0 interface. and when I run a show ntp status and associations I see that we are sync&#x27;d with the servers. I just need the Windows servers to get their time from my router.

                              <span>I am new to cisco asa. I have few uses cases on automation using python for a client. Do CISCO firepower 2130, 4110 provides REST API. According to documentation 4110 has api feasibility but the team is saying 2130 also has api too. Am I missing something.. it will be really helpful if I can get any advice.

                              <span>...with Mellanox ConnectX cards. But I guess what I&#x27;m asking is on the generic level, anyway. I&#x27;m in IT infrastructure, but not a network expert.
 Anyway, these are the pages I mainly got my information from:
 https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/MLNXOFEDv471001/OVS+Offload+Using+ASAP2+Direct
 https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/l/architecture-guide-ready-architecture-for-red-hat-openstack-platform-version-16-1-flex-2/sr-iov-ovs-hardware-offload-with-vf-lag
 ​
 My understanding is: VF LAG means two physical ports / physical functions on a card are getting bonded. And then virtual functions of that bonded interface are passed through to VMs.
 And using SR-IOV, the kernel offloads that stuff to the NIC.
 Is my understanding correct?

                              <span>Is anyone else seeing a recent trend of Dell&#x27;s laptops (Precision 5x and XPS devices) coming with fingerprints on the plastic wrap, laptop and dirt or fragments of what seems to be shavings from the keyboard and other components in the box? I&#x27;m all for adding a little spice to the machines but you would have thought being such an expensive device ($3-5k AUD EACH) that they&#x27;d at least clean them before sending them out.
 Just wondering whether this is us (Sydney, Australia) or whether we&#x27;ve been feeding down from a bad batch of machines for the last 6mo. We&#x27;re about to start direct-to-user&#x27;ing them with Autopilot and it doesn&#x27;t exactly make it feel like a great experience. Never had this issue with any other vendor.
 EDIT: pictures of one we received this morning - you&#x27;ll note the device hasn&#x27;t been taken out of the plastic wrapper yet

 Do you think there will be better communication now about new employees and leavers? :D

https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/
  
Background: Reddit is starting to charge for their API, which means that open-source reddit clients will likely cease to function next month.
 In response, hundreds of subreddits are going dark to remind Reddit that their website is only as valuable as their user&#x27;s content. And the users want to be able to use open-source apps.
 Can /r/sysadmin join this protest by going dark for 48 hours, starting on June 12th?
 Edit While this subreddit is dark, users can still share and read about critical outages on /c/sysadmin on lemmy as a backup/alternative in the fediverse.

                              <span>So apparently SendGrid started enforcing TLS 1.2 on all emails into their API on 6/5/23. I heard about our clients not receiving emails and chased it down to our powershell script invoking the API needing this new line.
 [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol &#x3D; [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
 This forces powershell to use TLS 1.2 and everything works fine again.
 Just thought I&#x27;d share in case your sendgrid emails aren&#x27;t working - that&#x27;s likely the culprit!
 Cheers!

                              <span>So I’ve been in an IT manager role for 2 months now. I’ve noticed that as a company we tend not to be very innovative and stuck in old ways. We’re scared to try new technologies, because I’m told this is always how it’s been done. Hell, we don’t even warranty devices…. Does anyone have thoughts from a sysadmin viewpoint, on how to encourage higher ups to allow me and other to use newer technology and trends?

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking to put in a monitor for simple up/down/availability on our monitoring server. Since this is intended to let us know if the monitoring server becomes unavailable, we want something cloud hosted, ideally with an agent-based checkin from the node to the cloud service (we don&#x27;t want to open the server up to external polling).
 We&#x27;re not looking to monitor more than that node so we&#x27;re essentially looking for a service that is happy to provide service for a single node.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on vendors we could take a look at?

 And I’ve never been on a call where a software engineer has had to join.
 Currently have a situation where a software product out company sells to customers is straight up not working and customers are so angry they are threatening to quit. Software people seem to only have to work their usual hours and don’t even seem concerned with the issue.

 There are no &quot;unused&quot; domains that are available, all domains in question have had previous owners. Can this affect deliverability? What if the previous domain owner used it to broadcast spam?
 ​
 I myself don&#x27;t send any unsolicited (or even solicited) marketing emails. We basically only respond to customer inquiries within minutes or days at latest. In other words, almost none of our outgoing mail is not a response to an earlier, incoming mail from the corresponding sender.
 However, since it&#x27;s a support email address, delivery is very very important so we don&#x27;t want to risk hitting a spam folder with customers then complaining that they haven&#x27;t received a response yet

But I can’t for the life of me figure out how to create a iSCSI disk to expose in the Virtual Machine Manager Fabric. 
 My idea now is to just add a simple volume to a VM and installed the iSCSI target role on it. Any better ideas for those of you who have worked with this before?

 Have been enabling bitlocker for one of our clients, have been doing it manually per machine as the client (rightly) doesn&#x27;t want to buy an Intune license just to manage this.
 Have got the keys saved in a secure location, but having checked both in the tenant Azure and the actual users My Devices section, I can&#x27;t see the key in there, although this has all been within the last 5 mins to be fair.
 The real question I suppose; does the client now require an Intune license in order for 365 to store Bitlocker keys?

 Anyone else experiencing this, and am I being paranoid in thinking this is Russian hacking/DDoS?

 For a few years we used Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, the router was performing fine, but it stopped working and we need to replace it and we have a choice of going with another EdgeRouter or replacing it with either Sonicwall or FortiGate. 
 Our endpoints all have SentinelOne.
 For our environment, what would you recommend?

                              <span>Hi,
 in my company there is the need for several users (operators) to use a single machine, so we created service account with the accountability of head of deparment. 
 But there is the need for that account to write to file server. H i see 2 problems here:
  
Accountability for service account that access to file server. 
 The machine is running h24, there is a way to manage password expire for the service account in file server? The need is to write h24 to file server.

 What typically do you charge for a server migration (currently quoting 5 hours):
  
On prem to Azure AD virtual service
 AD migration (20 users)
 Group policy migration (nothing complicated)
 Data migration 1TB (noting complicated)
 Printers

 I´m concerned by the use of ChatGPT in my organizations. We have been discussing blocking ChatGPT on our network to prevent users from feeding the Chatbot with sensitive company information. 
 I´m more for not blocking the website and educate our colleagues instead. We can´t prevent them for not accessing the website at home and feed the Chatbot with information. 
 ​
 What are your thoughts on this?

                              <span>Hi there i received a project of making 25PCs boot through network from my lecturer at collage
 I have experience setting DHCP servers before but have never done anything like this before so any resources and guidance or alternative solutions would be helpful 
 I was planning to use ISCSI following directions in the below video but in the comments it said that only 1 client can boot at a time 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_elwqBKIlLI
 The link below says that using ISCSI it can diskless boot multiple client but i cant find any resources or guides on this
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/iscsi/iscsi-target-server
 The goal is to have the clients boot up with a fresh preconfigd os with preinstalled applications every restart 
 Im currently looking at ccboot or dds+ but of course ill look elsewhere first since i need to pay for it
 The server is a HP proliant dl380p gen8 The PCs is a mix of models from HP &amp; DELL 
 Sorry if my grammar is bad english is not my first language

                              <span>Out supplier stopped selling HP servers so we decided to try a DELL t150 but i cant quite figure out what ssds to get. I just need a few 480 gb ssd in raid 5 for vmware. 
 Supplier suggeted the 345-BEFN 
 Dell suggested the 480GB SSD SATA Mixed Use 6Gbps 512e 2.5in w/3.5in Brkt AG, Cabled which looks similar 
 ​
 But those both come in brackets that look like they wouldnt fit the t150. Does anybody have any suggetions? Or would something like a Kingston Data Center DC500M work as well?

 I have two questions related to Cisco Umbrella. 
  
What is difference between DNS application and Web Application ? 
 What is the best practices on DNS Application Policy in Cisco Umbrella DNS. 
  
Thank you so much.

                              <span>Hi fellow sysadmins. We are currently discussing allowing/using ChatGPT or other natural language processing tools in our company. I see that some of you already use it. How do you use it? Any providers you use? 
 Did you do an information security risk assessment? Any other implications on security that we would need to be aware of?
 Would love to hear your experiences.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I was wondering who of you got some good software approval requests processes? Maybe ITIL compliant, maybe not?
 I find the process hard, as there are many factors, costs/cybersecurity/the technical pull for maintenance etc. 
 We do have a good process for big systems, such as CRM etc. but for the smaller ones, time and attendance, task management, plug-ins etc. are a bit complex to handle and results in long approval times for the users, and a lot of no&#x27;s.
 I was thinking about a software technology board, and to try to shift as much decision power left in the process so the first evaluator can make 90% of the decisions, but I would appreciate if any of you want to share your experiences?
 We are a global company with 800 users.

                              <span>Is it just me or for the past 1-2 years software is becoming less and less reliable ?
 I feel like a lot of &quot;stable release&quot; software is starting to behave a lot like beta software and basic functionality is thrown under the tracks just to push out unnecessary updates.
 I was thinking this is was just in gaming, a model where you release a broken piece of software that is somewhat usable only after 6 months of updates but you get your money because people are... people... but I start seeing it in a lot of software nowadays that gets a major update that breaks it for months (looking at you HP and DELL).
 From broken video (dear intel choke on broken always-on dynamic contrast) and audio drivers (waves choke on that out-of-a-barrel-echo) on 1000$ laptops to BIOS settings that don&#x27;t work properly ??? And crashes in software that was very reliable years ago from big companies like Cisco and Adobe.
 What the hell is going on here ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never met a sysadmin who actually wanted cold-calls from vendors. I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of (targeted) spam emails and calls, including to my personal cell (last one was from ADP... really? really?). I&#x27;m sure y&#x27;all get them too. Some of them even say &quot;I got your details from LinkedIn&quot; but they&#x27;re using details that LinkedIn never had. They&#x27;re likely getting your info from one of the big B2B services out there. So I went and compiled a quick list of 11 of the largest B2B databases, with the links to their opt-out/delete pages. 
 This is especially useful if you&#x27;re in CA, but should at least work if you&#x27;re in the US or EU. All of them will require your (business) email and some other details to process the request, and some are more solid than others. It&#x27;s also a good idea (if possible) to see what they have on you before requesting the delete -- that&#x27;s how I found one of them that had my personal cell # attached.

 my company is in a need of an e-mail archiving solution and I do not know any programs that are specialized for this. We work on projects which require us to have e-mails saved for legal purposes. The solution should be integrated in Outlook, offer some kind of search engine to find the e-mails easily.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Was tasked with building out a new HQ site and was curious as to what folks on here would choose for hardware options if they had the opportunity to greenfield something. I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don&#x27;t seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper&#x27;s EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \ AP&#x27;s and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP&#x27;s are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. 
 ​
  
Switches - Juniper EX (POE)
 Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA
 
Wireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)

                              <span>I am in the planning stage of setting up a small new publically routable network, and I wanted to ask if anyone had any experiance requesting IP addresses under policy 4.10, which allows for IPv4 allocations for IPv6 transition purposes like NAT464 servers, dual-stack dns and the like. I am planning for the network to be primarily if not exclusivly tv6, but I am still looking to maintian compatiblity with v4 devices, so it looks like this might be a good fit for me. Before I began applying however, I wanted to see what other&#x27;s experiances have been and what sort of documentation I should have on hand ahead of time.

                              <span>Sorry for the beginner question, pretty inexperienced with certificates.
 We&#x27;re using PKI/ NDES and Intune/ SCEP. This is set up and user/ machine certificates are flowing to the clients just fine. The user authentication is working fine as well. The issue I&#x27;m seeing is machine authentication failing on the login screen. Our NAC (ClearPass) is stating the object cannot be found in the identity store (local AD), which makes sense.
 Is this configuration possible? What would need to be adjusted to make this work?

                              <span>My company does structured cabling but it&#x27;s not what we primarily do. I have a customer requesting CAT7 for wall jacks and access points, but I&#x27;m completely unfamiliar with using CAT7. Are specialized jacks, connectors, and patch panels required? Will I have to worry about any compatibility issues?

                              <span>MS365 engineer did an assessment to see how ms teams will perform within my environment accessing their public presence. They have a threshold of 1% packet loss and 5 out of 6 locations they tested had 0.89% packet loss and only one had 1.33% packet loss. Due to that 1.33% they recommended we do qos end to end to mitigate that.
 My question is what will qos do if the locations they tested against has low bandwidth usage about 20-30% usage and no signs of congestion.

                              <span>We&#x27;re using TEAP for wireless authentication and I&#x27;m starting to pilot the same for wired. I&#x27;m running into a weird issue for just my machine so far, where it will send my computer certificate but not user. The deployed GPO is basically the same as wireless which works fine and is the same as other machines/users that also work fine, on the same switch (9300L) to the same ISE nodes (2.7) and machines are running Windows 10 22H2. 
 Windows event logs don&#x27;t show any errors, but I can confirm with a pcap on the workstation that only the machine cert ever leaves it.
 I cannot for the life of me figure out why I can&#x27;t get it to send my user cert only over wired.

                              <span>Azure documentation needs some work. 
 Does anyone have experience building a S2S tunnel over an ExpressRoute with a pre-existing S2S, over the internet, already in place? Azure docs are specifying that I need to construct a VPN GW with a Public IP address and then &quot;convert&quot; it to private IP addressing to be used as the IPsec tunnel endpoint over the ER. 
 Does that make sense to anyone?

 I know what a Span port does but not the rest of the others.

                              <span>Hey there,
 I have recently started taken on additional responsiblity someone who is a co-administrator for a Zabbix monitoring solution. 
 Right now I have run into a wall and I dont entirely know how to solve it, ive tried google, looking up the MIB with google, infact ive wasted the last six hours on this and I need some advice.
 We have a bunch of Juniper SRX 320 routers using VDSL Cards running JUNOS 21.3R1.9 .
 Now I am trying to pull both Bit rate values from the VDSL card using interface pt-1/0/0
 &gt; show interfaces extensive pt-1/0/0 | match bit
 Bit rate (kbps) : 79999 0 20000 0
 The ifIndex of the interface is 539 and running an MIB walk I was able to identify the MIB that corresponds to the 20000 value (the upload speed)
 &gt;show snmp mib walk 1 | match 539
 ifIndex.539 &#x3D; 539
 ifDescr.539 &#x3D; pt-1/0/0
 ifType.539 &#x3D; 97
 ifMtu.539 &#x3D; 1492
 ifSpeed.539 &#x3D; 20000000
 ifPhysAddress
 ifAdminStatus.539 &#x3D; 1
 ifOperStatus.539 &#x3D; 1
 ifLastChange.539 &#x3D; 17347
 ifInOctets.539 &#x3D; 29758270
 ifInUcastPkts.539 &#x3D; 495971
 +900 more lines ive gone through.
 ifSpeed.539 &#x3D; 20000000 - This is the value that is the upload speed of interface pt-1/0/0 and I Was able to get the OID (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5.539) and pull it into our Zabbix 6 instance and its monitoring it just fine. 
 But I am HARD stuck at finding the MIB / OID corresponding to the value 79999 so I can also track the Download speed. I can not seem to find it anywhere. If I run an SNMP walk for that value it turns up nothing. I feel like im missing something and im now at bash head against wall territory so if I could get ANY advice that would be great.

                              <span>I have been preparing for CCNP and cleared my ENCOR and ENARSI last year. At my work, I typically search for any networking terms or concepts that I am not aware of and most of the time, I come across the website Network Lessons. Material is good and informative. Is it worth the subscription or $390/Year? I already have INE subscription which I use for video courses.

                              <span>Hello!
 I found that if I run iperf3 with option &quot;-bidir&quot; it lost about 50%(from 40% till 53%) of packets. 
 iperf3 -c 10.96.140.101 --udp -b 100m -bidir 
 If I remove &quot;-bidir&quot; it lost 0.5% 
 I believe it&#x27;s correct behavior, it&#x27;s verified new infrastructure, but I can&#x27;t explain to myself why. 
 Any thoughts, why that happens?

                              <span>We have an existing data center. All cabling is home run and bundled, dressed and tidy. 
 Occasionally, we get issues that crop up. Sometimes it’s a SPF issue, sometimes a port issue on a device. Rarely is the issue a cable. 
 But I’d like to be able to independently and confidently be able to test a cable and rule that out when issues come up. 
 I know Fluke testers are the industry standard. But they have them ranging from a lot of money up to a ton of money. I don’t know what I need. 
 Can someone lay out the options and benefits/shortcomings of what I need for occasional troubleshooting? I don’t see this as on par with needs of an installer who has to certify multiple runs at once with cable serial number printouts. But testing here and there is more likely the use case.

But how do I do it across hosted apps? One of our hosted services Mattermost recently launched a video call feature. We want to see if we have enough compute power to support more than a few of our customers at once making a video call. How do I do it and where do I start? I&#x27;ve tried googling and working with Zabbix and I can&#x27;t seem to figure it out. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I have a 3750 connected to a 9300 and it&#x27;s capping out at ~300mbps, with inconsistent speeds overall on iPerf.
 ​
 There are not policies on either switch. Both endpoint ports are on the same vlan and communication works fine, just the bandwidth is poor.
 ​
 I have updated both the 9300 and 3750 to the latest ios yet this hasn&#x27;t fixed it.
 ​
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas what it could be? (I cannot get rid of the 9300 at the moment)

                              <span>I was put in charge on updating our monitoring software and and I noticed that VLANs and Service Instances bandwidth usage can&#x27;t be measured becase they don&#x27;t have a valid ODI/MIB.
 What I also noticed that if a Service Instance is inside a port-channel or a bundle-ethernet they suddenly can be monitored, is this correct?
 So, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, if I REALLY wanted to monitor those service instances I can configure a port-channel with only 1 physical interface and I could get it working?
 FYI all of this is on a few ASR920 Cisco routers.
 How dumb is this? Is there a better way to do this?

 HOWEVER, running this removed the VLAN from every LACP Trunk and every interface! Why does this happen? Using Aruba j9850a

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on some networking assignments lately that could really benefit from the ability to detect what IP settings a particular switch is using. We have one netool.io at work, but it&#x27;s still in the grasp of another coworker. I&#x27;m wondering if I can potentially get the same performance from various Linux/Windows applications as I could from a netool.io. 
 Basically, I would just like to be able to plug into a switch cold and figure out what net address/subnet/vlans/etc. are currently configured. nmap and netstat are useful, but I haven&#x27;t been able to reliably log into a switch in a timely manner yet. 
 I&#x27;ll be heading back to Google shortly, but are there any online sources that explain specifically what netool.io and PockEthernet do? As I previously stated, it&#x27;d be really nice if I could just equip my laptop (or, ideally, my Samsung phone) with the tools necessary to perform the same function. 
 Any other ideas/reading/etc. for performing these sorts of tasks are also appreciated. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Good afternoon! I have such a task - there are several offices in which pfSense, Zyxel USG, Mikrotik, etc. are installed. And there is a VPS with pfSense without a LAN network - only WAN. I need to combine office networks via IPsec so that they can see each other, but with a centralized connection via VPS with pfSense (this is a prerequisite). The problem is that the old Zyxel routers do not support either Routed IPsec or OpenVPN, so you need to use only IPsec.
 I don&#x27;t understand how to configure IPsec on pfSense VPS without a LAN network, and what Phase2 policies to prescribe so that office networks can see each other.

 I admit to an excel spreadsheet. Looking to mature. What&#x27;s out there? Or what have you repurposed to accomplish something similar?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is just me, but for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out these damn Microsoft Surfaces and their inability to work with preinstallation environments. I&#x27;ve tried every combo of BIOS settings for them (disabling secure boot, etc..). Formatted both in NTFS and ExFat
 Try to boot using Hiren Boot CD? It loads the first frame, but you can&#x27;t move or select anything
 Try to boot using Windows Media Created USBs, freezes on the first screen
 Try to boot using Windows PE to build a new image, it gets stuck at wpeinit (Initializing). Can&#x27;t go any further.
 I did confirm it can boot to other situations like a Ubuntu .iso. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the USB file system.
 The laptops in particular are Surfaces 4 and 5 and probably other models. Does anyone have a good idea of what&#x27;s going on here? I can&#x27;t figure it out from my coworkers, nor the internet.

                              <span>Someone sent an email to several of our users. Email was pretending to be the owner of the company, and asking them to reply. All of them were outside salespeople, using their mobile phones with Outlook. So, they saw the name and not the email address so they responded. Then, and this is the new one for me,they received a text message asking them to call him. Their outbound email signature includes their cellphone number, but two of the salespeople who got the text message had not replied to the email.
 They all quickly figured out it was not the owner, so nothing bad happened. What bothers me, other than the contact list leak, is the text messages. A bot campaign sending out phishing emails is not unusual. But, sending text messages is a new one.
 Anyone seen this before?

                              <span>So the title basically tells the whole story. This morning I received an alert by Computrace/Absolute that a device had been tampered with. By company policy, I froze the device and made a report. I come to find out that our newly hired Developer (3 weeks into the job) had attempted to deactivate our encryption software and was looking to steal our device. I am completely baffled at this and beg to question, Why!? Has anyone had an experience like this with a new hire who had tried to rip off the company and then just leave??
 Edit: For those asking, he quit almost immediately after his device was frozen and is refusing to return the device.

                              <span>&quot;Have you tried turning it off and on?&quot; is a common thing IT guys get made fun of for saying, but I mean we kind of deserve it. If it works, use it! I think it&#x27;s funny that other professions ALSO turn it off and back on, they just don&#x27;t want to call it that. Like once my mechanic told me to fix an issue with my car we needed to unplug the battery for an hour and then hook it back up. I said &quot;So ... turn it off and turn it back on?&quot; and he was like &quot;no, no, not like a computer&quot; and I just said &quot;suuuure.&quot;
 Well this weekend I learned a new one. Saturday evening my heart started racing for no reason. I put on my wife&#x27;s FitBit and my heart rate was 124, well over the 80 it should have been. I ended up in the ER, and told me my heart was in AFib. Normally when you heart beats, the top part of your heart beats first, then the bottom part beats. In AFib the top part of your heart doesn&#x27;t beat, it just kind of flutters. For me this meant the bottom part was beating much faster to try and compenstate. 
 I had to have a procedure, and the doctor described it as &quot;We are going to put a tube down your throat to get a better view of your heart, then we are going to give you a drug that will stop your heart for a moment, then we will shock your heart to get it started again, and it should start beating normally.&quot; I said &quot;So... turn it off and turn it back on?&quot; He didn&#x27;t know what to say so I said &quot;It&#x27;s ok, I am very familar with this process.&quot; 
 So there you have it fellow nerds. There is nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed without turning it off and turning it back on.
 (FYI, the procedure went well and my heart is back to normal. Also I ordered a smart watch that can detect AFib.)

                              <span>I always kind of looked down on people who got pushed out of their jobs because I figured there must be something wrong with them.
 Meanwhile I was always kicking ass. I was with the same company 15 years, kept getting promoted, always had glowing performance reviews. Got to the point where i was head of my unit and was reporting to a VP. He was always kind of an ass, and also a bootlicker, and was a pain in the ass to work for, but we made it work.
 We got a new division president and he seemed ok, but for some reason this guy wanted nothing to do with me when normally I should have been someone who met with him occasionally.
 About 6 months later, after another glowing performance review, the VP I work for tells me they&#x27;re posting my job but with a more senior title, and he said I was we…</span>

                              <span>Thought I&#x27;d share my hassle with you all in case it helps someone else.
 I have Barracuda Firewalls in Azure VMs and today everything behind that firewall just failed.
 After hours spent on the phone with support. it turns out there was geo update that labeled a certain ip address as coming from Hong Kong. this was an incorrect update. And if you are like my business and block all traffic from certain regions (in this case Hong Kong) then good luck getting in. for the longest time we were scratching our heads as our firewalls appeared functional and fine yet the only way we could communicate with them was through the azure serial console.
 ​
 Solution
 We created an outside VM in our azure environment that we could run the barracuda admin console on and thus make the corrections and exempt the IP address.
 ​
 Barracuda literally learned about this as we called. so, if you call you may have a smaller wait time than I did. thought I&#x27;d share the knowledge in case anyone needed it.

                              <span>Wow, Datadog&#x27;s sales are getting aggressive. Anyone else experiencing this?
 I keep getting calls from Datadog on my personal phone. They must have scraped it from the web. It&#x27;s pretty obvious I&#x27;m being targeted due to my title. Nobody else at my company is getting these calls. I never requested any info from them either.
 I&#x27;ve already told them we use a different stack and aren&#x27;t interested in changing. Datadog is WAY too expensive for us already and I&#x27;ve read enough billing issues and &quot;getting bit by the dog&quot; posts on this subreddit dealing with DD on top of that.
 I mentioned that there is one monitoring element I haven&#x27;t found solution for (big mistake). I work in the robotics industry so I threw him a question about if they had solutions for ROS monitoring. He said no. Ok so I tell him I&#x27;m not interested and hang up.
 Two weeks later I get an email from the DD sales guy saying he discussed my needs with a developer and wanted to see if i was interested in what they came up with. They basically began trying to sell me on software that was hacked together after 2 weeks and wasn&#x27;t even listed on their website. I&#x27;m good. No thanks.
 Months. no more calls. Ah peace.
 Today. The cycle has started again. Maybe a new guy. Idk. Told him I&#x27;m not interested. This time I keep my mouth shut about ROS.They obviously still don&#x27;t offer it publically. He sent me a calendar invite anyway. He said if you can&#x27;t make it or if you&#x27;re not interested, just cancel. Fair enough.
 Ok, so I just cancelled that meeting. Now I&#x27;m getting emails about me cancelling and trying to reschedule. 
 I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t want your software. I already said no on the phone and email multiple times and cancelled your meetings. I have an option to reschedule too but, I didn&#x27;t. Take a hint.
 Probably going to block them if this doesn&#x27;t stop soon. I&#x27;ve never had to do this before in my career with any vendor.

                              <span>I started as a temp at a small science facility last Tuesday. I feel ok here, it&#x27;s just a weird position to be in. I get along well enough with my manager and the sr admin on site. The Sr admin likes me but is already pushing for me to get brought on full time. I&#x27;ve gotten good feedback from them so I know that I&#x27;m doing something right.
 It doesn&#x27;t feel right that the sr admin is already pushing for me to go full time after only a week. I don&#x27;t even know what would come of this, the manager seems a little resistant to this but I imagine that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s only been a week. I can&#x27;t tell if anything is wrong or not but I could use some sage advice. I think if I got it, it&#x27;d be a good opportunity for me to be a jr. I came from a background of Helpdesk / Desktop support with sysadmin duties mixed in so I have a lot of experience with what they do and I could use more.

                              <span>I know that the solution is to get the framework updated for these ancient internally hosted sites and portals for them to be free of IE dependency. However, the answer is always &quot;there&#x27;s no budget for upgrades. Please continue to support&quot;. Access is becoming increasingly unreliable no matter how many IE Mode settings are tweaked on my end or the vendors end.
 External vendors are being given my contact information by procurement and purchasing departments and being told to contact me and I will fix it. I&#x27;m getting 2-3 requests a day from different people, knocking down my door screaming about how this needs to be fixed right this minute.
 I am not an applications person, the one applications manager we had left years ago. I am not sure how to approach this from a technical or professional perspective. I cant wave a magic wand and make incompatible technology suddenly work, but I also can&#x27;t simply throw my hands up and say &quot;Sorry, not my problem&quot;.

                              <span>We had a user use their Microsoft work email and create a Personal Microsoft account with it and now we&#x27;re stuck figuring out the mess. I wasn&#x27;t aware that you could run a personal and work account side by side using the same email but the issue we&#x27;re running into is when they&#x27;re logged into the browser on their work account and attempt to open a SharePoint document in the desktop app it prompts for authentication so they&#x27;ll type their email address and then get prompted to choose between the work or personal account. Once they select work, the account is signed in but the document is blank and eventually gives an error saying the document cannot be opened. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve verified it&#x27;s any document on SharePoint opened in desktop app, even if downloaded and then opened locally. We&#x27;ve removed the personal account from her machine (this particular user&#x27;s is not domain joined unlike most), changed the primary alias on the personal account to a bogus email in hopes it wouldn&#x27;t recognize it and removed the company email, turned off &quot;auto sign in to microsoft apps&quot; to revert them back to local account, reinstalled office, signed out of M365 on both accounts on browser and cleared cookies, tried various browsers and banged our heads against the wall for a long time. Has anyone ran into this issue? Does anyone know how to get out of it? Closing the personal account apparently can be done, it just requires contacting MS support which if I have to I will.

                              <span>Howdy folks,
 After about a year of asking for our manager and dept head to give us an actual policy of what on-call entails and not just &quot;work with the team to make sure any off-hours issues are resolved&quot;, we finally have it in writing, and it sucks. 
 We are expected to respond to all issues that come in 24 hours a day during the 7-day stretch we are on call. All issues have to be answered within the 0-2 hour SLA, including those reported by slack, jira ticket, email, and phone call. This is in addition to our normal 8 hour work day.
 The volume of calls generally isnt that bad (2-3 per day), but its the SLA bit thats chapping my rear a bit. To meet this expectation I&#x27;d have to set an alarm on my phone to wake up and check slack and Jira every 90 minutes or so. And on top of that we are to answer any helpdesk calls that come in regardless of time. 
 Aside from the question of legality in my state (I&#x27;m asking a friend who is a lawyer about that), I wanted to get the opinion of folks on here. Is this even remotely normal/acceptable?

                              <span>Greetings,
 I have a peculiar situation at work where we once used exchange server 2003 back in 2009. And our primary DC was on windows server 2008. 
 Nowadays, we have our domain controler synchronized with azure every half an hour and we want to upgrade it from 2008 to 2019.
 So both our dc and azure are aware of the old 2003 exchange(now offline). Since our mails are on microsoft exchange atm, if we do the upgrade im afraid that something might go wrong since i dont know if both of them are aware 2003 is out of service.
 Is there any way to know for sure? Thnx

                              <span>They found someone better fitting with more experience and fired me.
 I&#x27;ve worked here for just under a year, I&#x27;m 25 and started right after finishing school.
 First week I started I had an auditor call me since an IT-audit was due. Never heard of it, had to power through.
 The old IT guy left 6 months before I started. Had to train myself and get familiar with the infrastructure (bunch of old 2008 R2 servers). Started migrating our on-prem into a data center since the CEO wanted no business of having our own servers anymore.
 CEO called me after-hours on my private cellphone, had to take an old employees phone and use his number so people from work could call me. They never thought about giving me a work phone.
 At least I learned a lot and am free of stress. Have to sit here for the next 3 months though (termination period of 3 months).

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking to replace our old VMware cluster of 4 hosts, 2 vSAN arrays, and about 60 VMs with an HCI solution. I&#x27;ve spoken to a number of vendors and it seems like everyone is pushing Nutanix very hard. Reading through some of the experiences here, most of them seem to be overwhelmingly negative on their HCI platform, and even more so on AHV. Has anyone actually had a positive experience with them in a reasonably small environment like mine? With the uncertainty with VMware&#x27;s future, I am leaning in the direction of considering them.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve inherited a project from the previous IT guy who left recently. It&#x27;s a small company, with just me and two other IT guys, supporting 500 users.
 The requirement is to build a SQL environment using Windows Server Failover Clustering. This will be a two node SQL cluster (active/passive) running on across two virtual machines.
 My question is what licensing will be required. The company has SA, so from what I&#x27;ve read only the active node needs to be licensed. Just looking for some guidance on what I need to get the company to pay for. Would SQL Standard edition, and licensing for the cores on the virtual machine for the active node?
 Sorry for the simplistic questions, I&#x27;m new to SQL and I find microsoft licensing very confusing.
 Thanks for any assistance.

                              <span>Hello, 
 It has recently occurred to me that part of job of IT and sysadmin is gaslighting users. Not intentionally. However over the years I have found that users will generally tell you a problem only for you to try it and it works. There have also been times where you make a change on the network, something you think won&#x27;t be affected is affected and you undo that change. Instead of explaining the process of what you did (because either the user wont care or understand) you say, it&#x27;s fixed. Or there have been instances when you kind of made a stupid mistake and instead of admit your mistake, you quietly undo the thing and the user is puzzled as to why it started working again. 
 I have been in IT for about 15 years in numerous roles and still carry a passion for it. I will passionately explain things to people if they will listen. For some reason though, I have found due to the environment and nature of IT, people either don&#x27;t take interest or done care so you are sometimes left to look like you just performed magic and it is now working. 
 I am just wondering if anyone else feels the same.

 I decided to go though that post and delete all my followup comments and summarize everything here.
 I&#x27;m no longer mad at Cisco I&#x27;m more philosophical about it. I can&#x27;t be mad at a lamprey for being a lamprey, it&#x27;s just in their nature to survive by providing very little and then continuing to take and take and take, forever. Cisco, sadly, is running hell&#x27;s bell&#x27;s to turn into that kind of company, right after Microsoft. Unlike Microsoft, though, Cisco is NOT a monopoly. Monopolies like Microsoft are government regulated and slapped down when they get too greedy. So, they don&#x27;t do disgusting things like release HARDWARE products that stop functioning if you stop paying monthly subscription …</span>

 Was it in the first year? Your first role? Second? Third? Etc… did you move to a role which allowed you to expand your skill set? Drill down certs? 
 I ask, as 2 1/2 years in and there is of course so much I don’t know but in the last two years my ability and overall knowledge has developed a lot.

                              <span>The company I work for has an Azure only environment. 
 We disable a user when an employee leaves the company (we never delete it), removing the license. 
 What we want is that an email goes out saying that the employee has left the company if someone tries to send the former employee an email. 
 I am trying to set up a catchall mail that sends that autoreply following these instructions (almost)
 https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30462.office365-catch-all-mailbox.aspx?fbclid&#x3D;IwAR0DOO6wZRZvJaLRa5SHaaINP8a4BAzuDJ8AiGDlqXuarLVIFY9jrDpLrcs 
 I set up a distribution group (not dynamic) with an email address [disabledusers@contoso.com](mailto:disabledusers@contoso.com) , I also set up an shared mailbox employeehasleft[@contoso.com](mailto:userhasleft@contoso.com) with the OOO autoreply. 
 I set a task in our offboarding lifecycle workflow to add the user to the disableduser group. 
 I changed the accepted domain (in exchange - mailflow) to InternalRelay 
 I set up a mailflow rule 
 &quot;Apply this rule if
 Is sent to a member of group &#x27;disabledusers@contoso.com&#x27;
 Do the following
 Redirect the message to &#x27;employeehasleft@contoso.com&#x27;&quot; 
 But this thing is not working. 
 Is there no simple way to do this? I feel like I&#x27;m using &quot;old&quot; on prem solutions for my Azure only environment. 
 Thanks so much for your help guys

                              <span>Hey all,
 Recently started a project to make sure Bios/Firmware updates on all of our Dells are up to date. I am using the ADMX files from DCU, in GP I have the settings as follows...
 &quot;What to do when updates are found... Download and install updates.&quot;
 and for update settings I have tested multiple different settings and none of the have worked, originally I had it set on Automatic updates, but they wouldn&#x27;t update. Then I set it for a specific time daily, I set it for 7PM last night on my test computer. Come in this morning and see it says it checked for updates last night at 7PM but the last time it updated was 3PM yesterday. So why will it not update automatically?

                              <span>Sorry just venting Experienced infrastructure guy, 25+ years, uk based. Working a fixed term contract, due to end October, However… Was told when I started (April 2022) that a permanent role was coming up that I could apply for. Many managers, including my own, hinting that it would be a shoe-in 
 3 days leave, came back and was off sick with gastric flu for 5 days.
 Found out yesterday that they filled the vacancy without telling me it had gone live or asking if I wanted to apply
 Questioned it with him, oh it’s a totally different role, no it’s what I’m actually doing right now!😡
 So here we go again trying to find a perm role. Starting now, because I feel as (late) middle aged white dude, without a huge amount of cloud experience, the tick boxes are against me.
 So fed up of it all. 🤦

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve recently started moving all our users with admin rights to the Protected Users AD group.
 We&#x27;ve had no major fallout from this after an extensive testing period but one issue remains that I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything about anywhere.
 We use a couple of Windows Server systems as print servers. We would like to manage them (print queues, permissions etc.) remotely using printmanagement.msc run from an elevated mmc.exe. When connecting to one of our print servers (Windows Server 2019 systems), the account is immediately locked out.
 I can see no unusual events when this happens (4769 [requesting kerberos service ticket], 304 [granting kerberos service ticket to a &quot;Protected Users&quot; member] and ultimately 4740 [account locked out]) and can&#x27;t think of a reason why this would happen.
 Have any of you seen this before? I&#x27;d be grateful for any imput!

                              <span>So I started working for another company (side work), they have about 400 end users and all there machines have them set as local admins. Does anyone know of a script to remove this. Also if anyone has done this how would it inpact Windows Updates (they are done monthly automatically set by windows). As well as any other update. Would the end user have to call us to update certain software&#x27;s? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve got a real head-scratcher here. We have a user called Tim (not his real name) who&#x27;s calendar seems to be causing some major problems for other user&#x27;s Outlooks clients. When the other users have Tim&#x27;s calendar added to their list of shared calendars, their Outlook grinds to a halt and uses 40% of the CPU and causes total system instability. Every 5 seconds or so, it says &quot;updating Tim&#x27;s calendar&quot; in the bottom right before disappearing again. This continues constantly as it was affecting one user for over a week until they reported it.
 The only way to fix this is to remove Tim&#x27;s calendar from their Outlook completely - simply unchecking the box to display it doesn&#x27;t work.
 The weird part is not everybody who has Tim&#x27;s calendar has this issue, it seems to be 3 users out of about 10 who need access to his calendar. But all users who have this issue have Tim&#x27;s calendar in their Outlook, so I&#x27;m fairly certain the issue is actually to do with Tim&#x27;s calendar rather than the user&#x27;s outlook clients..
 So far I have tried; • Quick and full repairs of Office on both the user&#x27;s and Tim&#x27;s devices • New Outlook profiles for both Tim and affected users • Removing all offline and cached items from Tim&#x27;s Outlook calendar • Checking Tim&#x27;s calendar for any recurring meeting going for excessive lengths of time
 I&#x27;m honestly a bit lost as to what to try next so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 Coming from a SQL DBA background, I am trying to wrap my head around Azure architecture.
 I&#x27;m hoping I can have something cleared up.
 I have an Azure VM - E64-32s v3
 15 x P40 disks were allocated to this VM - With read-caching
 A storage pool was created using these disks to create one 30TB drive for SQL data files. (There is a separate pool for SQL log files)
 Now, the column size for the data file storage pool was created as 3.
 What does this actually mean? How does this affect performance?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 there&#x27;s a problem in our company with Microsoft Teams, especially with the chat feature.
 I think that Teams is a wonderful tool to use and can help us to boost our productivity at work. Unfortunately, some stupid colleagues use it to chat to each other, also creating groups. Now that the HR noticed it, they want me, as the IT admin, to disable the chat for everyone.
 I think that this approach is not the right one, firstly because there are a lot of people using the chat in the right manner, and secondly because a tool like Teams doesn&#x27;t make sense without a chat, for me.
 Now the question. Is there the possibility to restrict in some way the ability to create groups for some people or to talk to each other? I really can&#x27;t disable the chat for everyone, otherwise our dinosaurs colleague will continue to use the email as the tool to chat, send files, etc.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have always used Exchange at previous jobs so far, but at my new employer Kerio Connect 9.4.2 is in use. And I am still trying to get used to it. Now I have 2 questions: 
 1.When setting up a mail account, we do document the default password assigned to each account in the process, but many users change it later. The problem: if a user falls ill, we would like to add an absence note for his mails. The easiest way to do this would be directly in the user account, but to log in there I would need his password. Is there a way to set up an out of office notification in the dashboard with the admin account as well ? 
 2.Sometimes it is also desired that another user simply takes care of the account of the sick user temporarily. The easiest solution would probably be to simply give the user the sick user&#x27;s credentials...if we know them. Well, in Exchange it was comparatively simple: You simply gave the substitute access rights to the mailbox of the sick user and could then set up his account in Outlook, even without knowing his password. With Kerio I haven&#x27;t found such a possibility yet. Is there such a possibility to give another user access to a mailbox ?

 As you understand from title , If I set DisplayName attribute of Security Group in AD then Outlook Contact Card is showing Global Security Group (no mail-enabled security group).

 Is it normal ? So expected behaviour?

 I&#x27;m a young sys admin and one of my tasks is to ensure that we have enough computers,mouse,monitors, etc.
 I wanted to know how are you guys doing about that on your companies ?
 Do you have a specific budget (X€ per year?) allocated for that, or do you just buy when needed?
 Thanks everyone.
 PS; may excuse my english

                              <span>Hi all,
 Looking to potentially implement some more effective phishing/email attack testing against my end users.
 I&#x27;m just wondering what people are using these days.
 The main things I am looking for is that the templates are actually good, more resembling spear phishing then your general blanket generic phish, or easily converted to resemble them. Things like if it were to masqueared as a onedrive shared file it looks legit. The ability to replicate things like O365 MiTM attacks and more complex attacks would be great.
 I trust pretty much all my users to spot the obvious low effort phish, but recently due to how public the business is we get a lot spear phishing. We stop 99% of them but have had a few incidents where people have clicked through onto them, and frankly for the ones that have gotten through the various filtering I don&#x27;t blame them. They were good phish emails, branded up, using peoples names, and coming from legit domains it looks like our business would have dealings with leading to legit looking phish pages.

                              <span>Context: working for an SME, I&#x27;m the *only* IT Bod, I&#x27;m also the only remotely technical person in the business. It&#x27;s a full key man dependency with all the admin accounts etc sitting with me. I&#x27;ve argued against this for a long time but the business doesn&#x27;t &quot;have the resource&quot; to hire a second or train an existing person to be the second.
 Now for the processes, that&#x27;s all documented and ready to be given/read, however what do I do about admin accounts? For some products we have specific admin accounts, but I&#x27;m unable to give passwords/access because the person who is replacing me hasn&#x27;t been hired yet, so doesn&#x27;t have an email address I can give those details to. 
 For some products, we don&#x27;t have specific admin accounts as its licence based (tight company) and the admin just resides with me. I could make someone else in the team an admin but they won&#x27;t have the foggiest what to do with it and when the new IT bod comes along they wont have a clue how to transfer admin rights.
 What am I meant to do in this situation? How can I best facilitate an actual handover of administrative rights and privileges

 Hell no I don’t. I get to sit back and point the finger at Microsoft all day. I’d take an absurd amount of cloud downtime before even thinking about taking on that burden again. Just thinking about dealing with what MS engineers are dealing with right now has me thanking Jesus for the cloud.

                              <span>My current position at my current job is tough because although I worked my way from a tech into management I’ve a hard time proving to exec management IT is doing well. When any outage whether, it’s out of upgrades or equipment related they’re quick to hang me out to dry and threaten consultants. 
 I’ve decided to start applying at other places for a mix of Sys Admin, IT Manager, and VMware Admin positions but I’ve gotten 5 rejections so far. I wear so many hats here at this company sometimes this leads to some of systems being a set it and forget it so it’s hard to be razor sharp. After this 5th rejection I’m bummed out about my current situation and feel my only opportunity is to look at jobs that pay 2/3 of current salary just to get out but that’s not an option. Any way thanks for hearing a jack of all trades and failure at one.

 Weird/odd that no one&#x27;s picking this up or at least shooting down the credibility of it.

                              <span>So the company I work for was bought out, all the great stuff happened, benefits cost more, no raise, no real good news for normal techs and all. We usually work on call in a rotation, work from home that week, and we are able to monitor everything and work for OT pay. Now its being rumored that they will not pay OT rates, still want us to work afterhours/on call, but their fix is to let us leave early, which is just offensive. Is this a standard across the board? Is this legal? When my rotation comes up, if I am asked this I don&#x27;t think I can comply honestly, because it does not feel worthwhile to have my whole week sidelined, and potentially working afterhours (usually i hit a few calls but probably around 3-5 hours extra during my rotation) at my base pay, just wanted some kind support or some kind of resource or baseline so I know what I am potentially going to be walking into. Thanks!

                              <span>We are a startup and have been using Jumio for a couple of years. We have used just their ID verification product and its been OK so far. A couple of weeks ago we got an email from their numbskull VP that they will increase their minimum license fee from 2500 USD to 25000 USD. Yes, you are reading right; 10 fold. They have upgraded their platform and they are trying to shove a bunch of things we dont need( many dont need) down our throat and make us pay for it. it freaking pisses me off. We will most likely switch out. Just an FYI post for those considering KYC products.

 My manager is an actual workaholic who quoted that this morning. I am pushover so I just nodded, and also because he has 20 more years of experience, and is an authority at this job. He makes ridiculous amounts of money, and seems like his focus has always been to advance himself, make tons of money, (which is nice when you&#x27;re not coming off as an selfish prick telling folks to miss important family events). He also works late nights, and seems like is happy to do so. How do you even deal with these type of people? How do you even support these environments? His boss seems to be fine that he is still doing late night events after so many years, and it&#x27;s funny to me that for all the work they put in, not once on how to actually build out a team and delegate properly. ugh.
 Edit- I also want to add, that I also do late night maintenances, but I couldn’t make a maintenance event few weeks ago due to family gathering which they were aware about. Manager was upset that I couldn’t make the event hence the post

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard time and time again that the best-practice for monitoring tools is to only ever be alerted on things that require action from an actual person. 
 I agree with that philosophy, it makes crystal clear sense. Here&#x27;s the thing though: my workplace does not abide by that whatsoever, and it is intentional. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying and failing to clean up our SCOM environment since like March. 
 Every time I&#x27;ve approached my team and my boss about turning off an email alert that isn&#x27;t actionable, I&#x27;m always met with &quot;no, leave that on, I&#x27;d rather get the email than turn it off&quot;. 
 Every single person on my team receives hundreds of non-actionable alerts every single day. If you need information from a specific timeframe, you check your email alerts. Right clicking and &#x27;mark all as read&#x27; is an every day occurrence. 
 Sending a message in Teams that says &quot;you&#x27;re about to get bombarded by emails from what I&#x27;m working on, just ignore them&quot; is an every single day occurrence. 
 When we patch, we get thousands of email alerts that we have to sort through the following Monday every month. 
 I&#x27;ve tried telling my team that these alerts can be condensed into dashboards in SCOM where the information is just as accessible and your inbox stays clean. But they&#x27;d rather receive the emails. My boss is extremely clear on her stance that she&#x27;d rather get hundreds of non-actionable alerts per day and manually sort through them. 
 Do other places actually not do that? I&#x27;m putting a lot of effort into learning how SCOM works and how we can organize the data from SCOM to not rely on constant email spam. But my workplace wants the comstant email spam and has instructed me not to get rid of it. 
 Do you guys actually operate with the philosophy that emails should only be sent if an action is required?

 What have the fine folks at r/sysadmin done to push back and get the headcount needed to accomplish their work, or reset goals based on a reasonable work schedule?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 First of all, thank you for your valuable input and time.
 I&#x27;m a rookie sysadmin working for a fairly small company, and I&#x27;ve recently been tasked with exploring database rack monitoring. As someone with no prior experience in this domain, the vast amount of information available can be quite overwhelming.
 Overall i&#x27;m looking for a not too expensive setup to monitor our racks with a motion sensor and camera. 
 We rent multiple racks in different data centers, and our manager wants us to monitor these racks 24/7. The monitoring system needs to operate effectively in various environmental conditions, such as cold/hot temperatures and low/high light sources. Ideally, we&#x27;d like a camera to activate and record video on one of the rack&#x27;s servers when motion is detected. Additionally, we plan to dedicate a VM to manage the camera(s). Our requirements are relatively straightforward; we primarily need a camera to record any access to our equipment. 
 I&#x27;ve come across several recommendations from other sysadmins, with APC solutions being frequently mentioned. The NetBotz Camera Pod 165 appears to be a suitable camera option. However, I&#x27;m unsure if it can be used without a NetBotz rack monitor. I&#x27;ve also noticed suggestions for the Unifi camera solutions.
 Those solutions are extremely expensive for what we need to do. 
 ​
  
Would it be possible to simply use a webcam managed by the VM ? 
  
​
  
Are there good open-sourced project you experienced sysadmins are using for this particular use case scenarios ?
  
​
  
Which camera / webcams would be best suited for simply monitoring access to our racks? 
  
​
 I&#x27;m truly fresh out from school, we&#x27;ve done some image processing projects in python so maybe in the worse case I could improvise a cluncky script that launches everytime the VM boots up ?
 Apologies for the novice question, and I greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.
 Best regards,
 Ben

                              <span>We&#x27;re having a problem with our 365 retention policy and was hoping for some assistance. We made a policy that deletes items after 90 days for Exchange only. This is applying correctly to all inboxes, folders etc, except for the Deleted Items folder. Where should I be looking to see why this particular folder is being retained rather than having the delete policy apply? Outlook shows that the deleted items folder is set to that 90 day policy, so not sure what gives. Thanks!

                              <span>Currently was assigned to find out and fix the issue.
 Here is a screenshot of the issue from control panel: https://i.imgur.com/xajRxuv.png
 Basically GPO deployed printer is copy-pasted with the identical name many times (usually only 20 actual print queues) but now there are +200 duplicated entries. 
 What I have found out/know so far:
 - Issue seems to be limited to Xerox printers. The HP Printers seem to have no issue and are deployed the same way
 - The used printer driver is &quot;Xerox Global Print Drivers PS&quot; version 5733.1100.0.0 Typ 3
 - Medical environment. Many users per PC.
 - Afaik the issue is company-wide (50ish PCs). Not sure how wide though.
 - The device manager do NOT list the offending printer queue.
 - In Windows 10 menu -&gt; Devices the printer is listed (several times) as &quot;Driver not available&quot;.
 - If opened in the control panel -&gt; printers you can not interact with it beyond 3 options: Remove device, troubleshoot device and (if I remember correctly from the client pc) properties.
 - Full Windows environment (Both client and servers).
 Tried searching the issue already and found out it seems to be a xerox-specific issue but don&#x27;t really know where to start and still am kinda a rookie in many regards.
 Anyone had the same issue somewhere and know of a resource to fix it or to identify the problem better?

                              <span>Hi, We have PaperCut set up for a bunch of printers and all is good. Just added 2 new printers, iR-ADV C359, and when we switch to PaperCut the control panel just goes to a white screen and won&#x27;t load the app. We can still access the local menus such as 123.We have upgraded the server to the latest version (22.[something]) and also deployed the updated .jar file. 
 The server reports the printers are at 1.3.0.This seems to be a bigger issue than just my 2 new printers, anyone having this problem, and any workarounds?
 So far our vendor hasn&#x27;t been much help.
 ETA: vendor assures us that the printers are supported and that the reason they aren&#x27;t on the supported list is because they are too new.

 ​
 Had a group of architects and senior engineers dump a massive dumpster fire on the support team. Literally dozens of bugs. We got NO support documentation at all, diagrams are wrong, redundancy testing not being complete before releasing configurations to support, nothing. Not 1 bug ID was provided or information or anything.
 ​
 Anyone ever see anything like this before?

                              <span>One of our users had setup an iCloud with their M365 account, and it seems to cause conflicts with calendar invites. 
 The issue is that users sending invites from their iPhone/Mac calendars to this email get intercepted by iCloud and goes to the user&#x27;s iCloud calendar without ever making it to M365. 
 Has anyone else seen this issue and/or have any ideas for fixing it? The user is against updating their iCloud email.

                              <span>In the UK, if it matters (240V).
 We have a new Eaton UPS that should be hardwired (9PX with extended battery module) Our server room has two 16A supplies, presented as &quot;commando&quot; female sockets (2P+E, IEC 60309).
 The user manual states a cable cross section of 4-16mm2 or 12-6 AWG, which seems oversized. It&#x27;s possible to get up to 10mm2 as a flexible 3-core cable, but is it right? One end is terminated directly into the terminal block of the UPS, and I was hoping to have the other wired into a 16A commando plug so I can plug it in to the socket.
 (The electrician will be making the connections at each end, but have requested we source the cable and plug).
 I&#x27;m happy to source the 10mm2 cross section cable if it sounds right and would fit in a 16a connector. Length is a few metres between UPS and socket so cost is not an issue.

 What I&#x27;m thinking about is to create a Docker container per user and only give them access to said container. Within this container they&#x27;ll get sudo access. Is this a feasible idea?

After getting the update a few of them (Lenovo Thinkbook Gen 2) ran into some BSOD issues. It seems that when turning off secure boot they work just fine.
 ​
 Seems like the machines get the BSOD error Code: 0x0000428.

 how to solve a problem?
 User sync only works one way from onpremises to cloud when adconnect is configured. but when AD DC is configured with password requirements that is at odds with the password configuration in microsoft 365. when a user resets their password in the cloud, ms365 generates a password that doesn&#x27;t match the AD DC policy which creates a conflict. how to solve a problem?

                              <span>Looking for some advice from my fellow sysadmins with regards to backup of MS/Office 365.
 We&#x27;ve been using Veeam for a couple of years (on-prem backup server), and IMHO it&#x27;s been working quite well.
 But one of my co-workers is sceptical to the whole concept of having all our files, e-mails, etc stored on an on-prem server - in case it gets compromised, then we have a huge problem. So he does have a valid point, even if we have done everything possible to avoid this (separate network, server is only accessible indirectly, etc). 
 So currently, we&#x27;re running the backups manually (boot server, run backup, shut down server again) once a month or so.
 Now that our Veeam licenses are about to expire, we are considering not renewing the licenses and live without backups and rather rely on the various safety features in MS365.
 What would you guys do?

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m no sysadmin, currently more of a very low level support. Think google workspace administration, sitting down with a coworker if they switch from Win to Mac to explain some basics for example, and the omnipresent &quot;why is the printer not working&quot;, that sort of think ...
 My question for you guys is - where to read about a &quot;proper&quot; business IT setup? By that I mean how things should run in a professional setting, compared to private users. I know local accounts are not the way to go, nor is setting up 20 devices in a row manually, or purchasing one MS Office license at a time, running MDM ... but where can I learn about the correct procedures?
 This place can get confusing. I can read and try to understand what ADDS is, or GPO, PDQ inventory, FOG deployment, and a bunch of other terms, but it doesn&#x27;t help much for the overall picture
 If you got a moment to help out, thank you.

                              <span>Good morning, 
 I am a IT tech working on becoming a sysadmin myself. A step in this plan is solving an issue with outlook. 
 My company uses Salesforce to collect and synchronize email signatures on outlook.
 Ever since we started deploying windows 11, We have been facing a comfort issue for a lot of users. 
 The issue is the salesforce signatures synchronize on outlook and appear under signatures on this device. Though the signatures appear here we are unable to select them in the choose default signature block. 
 We are using outlook version 2304 on window 11 22H2. 
 If anyone has any lead for a solution I will be forever grateful.

 This isn&#x27;t very actionable as it requires us to manually harass end-users into improving their passwords/password re-use, only for them to make the same mistakes a few weeks later and show up on the report again. 
 Can anything be done, at the very minimum, to automate nagging users to have a better score?

                              <span>Around the end of April, some of the mailbox rules in Outlook stopped automatically moving messages to their appropriate folders in my inbox. These rules have worked unchanged for years. I&#x27;ve tried recreating, enabling/disabling, deleting Outlook program files associated with mailbox rules but nothing in my googling or help from Microsoft has resolved my issue yet. Microsoft 365 support is still investigating.
 A couple weeks ago I noticed an Exchange Online transport rule not working as it has in the past. It looks at sender domain, if the sender if outside the org, and dmarc&#x3D;pass, dmarc&#x3D;bestguesspass in the header of messages to determine if the message should bypass spam filtering. Now it appears it won&#x27;t bypass spam filtering if the message is sent to more than one recipient, even if the rule is a match. I find this strange since the rule doesn&#x27;t check recipient information at all.
 Anyone else experiencing any shenanigans with Outlook rules or Exchange Online transport rules?

                              <span>A relative of mine uses widows&#x27; RDP to connect from her laptop to her desktop. She noticed that after connecting via rdp, the resolution on the desktop PC changes, but when she changes it back to the previous setting, the image is still off and there are some parts that are completely cut off like the taskbar. Turns out opening up the intel graphics control panel and changing the setting to &quot;Adjust to screen&quot; (or something like that iirc) fixed it. 
 Is there any way to prevent RDP from messing with these settings? If not, at least some way to automatically change them back when the computer starts up again.

 Sometimes, you luck out and stumble across an extremely simplified solution to what seems to be a complex task, and it absolutely rocks your world with how easy the task just became.
 Many times, these solutions are considered &quot;common knowledge&quot;, and you scratch your head whenever someone around you has their mind blown.
 The thing is, what you may think of as common knowledge is something that someone else in the same role as you has never heard of. Yet.
 If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve failed up into your current SysAdmin-ish role by pure random happenstance, tenacity, failing better (meaning that you fail, learn, and move on to the next more complex failure, learning again, and moving on... you get my drift), and turning a hobby into a career. You drink from a firehose your entire professional life and earn your scars through pure experience, frustration, and one or two nervous breakdowns. I&#x27;d spare anyone that last experience if I could.
 Drop your wisdom in here so that others may benefit. It doesn&#x27;t matter how simple you think it is. If it&#x27;s something that changed how you perform a task, or it redefined a process, please share.

                              <span>Anyone using the Windows Server Admin Center? We&#x27;re trying to set it up for our local On-Site Servers. We wanna use the force SSL mode. I installed the local wildcard cert and configured winRM service accordingly on the servers. The strange thing is, it works on most servers, but for some servers it throws &quot;Could not verify certificate state, could not check if the certificate is blocked&quot;.
 I can&#x27;t see any difference in the server configs, WinRM is configured the same on all servers, certificate is the same on all servers, I already restarted the servers, but some just don&#x27;t wanna be managed...

                              <span>Hi /r/sysadmin
 I&#x27;m currently facing an issue with VMware Horizon 8 and instant-clone image publishing, and I could really use some assistance. Whenever I try to publish my instant-clone image, I encounter the following error message in Horizon:
 &quot;Publish Error:
 Fault type is AGENT_CUSTOMIZATION_FAULT - Internal template vm-542704 customization failed. Error description not set by agent.&quot;
 I&#x27;ve already attempted a couple of troubleshooting steps, but unfortunately, the problem persists. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried so far:
 Removing AV software: I thought that the AV might be interfering with the publishing process, so I temporarily uninstalled it from the system. However, this didn&#x27;t resolve the issue. See here; https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90781 
 Using sysprep instead of clone: In an attempt to overcome the customization failure, I switched from using the clone method to sysprep. Despite this change, the error message still pops up.
 I&#x27;m now at a loss for what to do next. Have any of you encountered a similar error while publishing instant-clone images in VMware Horizon 8? If so, I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have to help me resolve this problem.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 In the past week I&#x27;m learning how to set up a CA server. During my research I&#x27;m noticed EC certificates are preferred, BUT most of the guide is still RSA. Also noticed that most of the guide is too basic, not explainin lots of things.
 I&#x27;m trying to create a guide for myself, when I&#x27;m done I will share it somewhere. Most likely I will not use this instead of vault/let&#x27;s encrypt/windows CA etc... But I want to learn the certificates in depts.
 First I done it with openssl for learning the basics, how to create and generate CRL,CRT. I created a config.cnf file https://pastebin.com/zf6XMk2W for the openssl configurations. There is something I couldn&#x27;t do it. Which is the SAN - subject a…</span>

                              <span>We occasionally have a development update file that we need to give customers to fix issues with the software we provide.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at the options of sharing from the OD, but I&#x27;m not keen on the Dev sharing a file direct from the OD via email. (He is under a business use case and special group to allow him to do it btw) Ideally I want no connection from user to Dev OneDrive.
  
 It seems the best option I can find is to have some kind of sharing site he is allowed to upload the file to, then the customers gets an email with a time limited download.
  
 So questions.
  
1) Does anyone know secure sites that would fit the bill?
 2) Is there a way to build something like a simple download site in AWS? We could put up something in AWS if needed. (Not my area but we have some knowledge)
 3) Does anyone have any links that they could point me too for what&#x27;s need to make that in AWS?
 4) Or any other suggestions

                              <span>Hey,
 ​
 my hoster told me that he will end his service till the end of the month. I am running quite critical things on this service. I am able to get by backups in a .img.gpg format by the hoster. Now I need a VPS-Service where I can upload the last backup in this format to move without long downtime.
 My current setup is
 4GB RAM
 2vCores
 200GB storage
 100 Mbit up/down
 Located in Germany
 ​
 I could take some more RAM, storage and vCores. But it is not necessary.
 Are there any (pricey) services that are capable of this setup?

 The DOL has information that in my reading would be hard to argue that any IT position is non exempt, falling under the professional exemption. You need college/training to support IT systems and as long as you’re paid the minimum - how would you argue a position is non exempt otherwise?
 https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17a-overtime
 I tried searching this sub (I didn’t look very hard or long) and didn’t find any posts of people saying they were able to fight their exempt status.
 Have you seen or heard of anyone fighting their exempt status?
 Edit: Here’s an example of someone winning but their job was more helpdesk, not sysadmin https://www.dkattorneys.com/publications/personnel-exempt-flsa-overtime-requirement/ We as sysadmins have some say in the design of IT systems.

                              <span>I have installed some Aruba 535&#x27;s and a virtual mobility controller. I&#x27;ve ran into an issue with our network layout and I&#x27;ve been working with HP&#x27;s TAC for weeks now and have seemed to accomplished nothing but to circle around to my original problem. I&#x27;m hoping there might be someone here that better understands Aruba&#x27;s wireless solution to help me make a bit of progress.
 I&#x27;ve ran into an issue where with our branch locations, even though traffic can traverse between the controller and the AP, it can&#x27;t establish a IKEv2 tunnel. Due to this it continuously has the AP reboot. Related, it seems that the tunnels continuously renegotiating eventually overloads the VM and causes it to drop. Both of these issues seem to be resolved with disabling CPSec. (Which the TAC recommended as a remedy)

 I&#x27;m going through the DHCP Snooping configuration here: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst_digital_building_series_switches/software/15-2_7_e/b_1527e_consolidated_cdb_cg/configuring_dhcp.html
 And I see no mention of if it also will drop IPv6 offers in addition to IPv4.
 Any ideas on if it will?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am working towards an FSRM solution that triggers an email alert and action when a blacklisted ext is uploaded on all of our File Servers. I tried a whitelist approach but this will not work in our environment.I am pulling the blacklist from the famous https://fsrm.experiant.ca/.
 ​
 I have been back and fourth with our infosec team and my own research on what is the best course of action if a user does upload a blacklisted file type. Most people online say to do an SMB denial, some want to do a network kill switch, and some want to lock/disable the user account.
 ​
 The Infosec team did agree with my research after I suggested an SMB denial and disabling the AD account but after further research I feel this may not be the best solution. Reference here:https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6pq2uv/help\_with\_fsrm\_command\_to\_disable\_ad\_account/After I sent this new information, they decided to advise that we utilize Sentinel One&#x27;s logging and then it can escalate from within S1 and then we can kill the network from the console or re-enable.
 ​
 What do other Sysadmins do for this?

                              <span>We&#x27;re about to embark on an exciting deployment journey involving Cisco DNAC, ISE, and WLC across four sites, and we would love to tap into the collective knowledge of this amazing community to gather suggestions and tips for enhancing our architecture.
 Here&#x27;s a brief overview of our deployment plan:
 Scope: Total 4 sites (1 HQ and 3 remote)
 DNAC Cluster: We will have a DNAC cluster with three nodes located at our headquarters, ensuring high availability and redundancy.
 WLCs and PSNs: Each site will have two Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and two Policy Services Nodes (PSNs) to handle wireless connectivity and authentication.
 ISE PAN and MNT: At our headquarters, we plan to host ISE Primary Administration Node (PAN) and Monitoring (MNT) nodes for centralized management and monitoring.
 Integration with DNAC: We&#x27;re integrating the PAN node with DNAC using PxGrid to leverage the capabilities of both platforms.
 Site Details:
 Each site consists of Catalyst 50+ switches, 300+ Catalyst Wi-Fi 6 WAPs, and 2000+ users.
 HQ and Remote Sites are connected over the Site-to-Site (VPN.
 We are working with a partner who will assist us with the design and deployment, but I firmly believe in the power of community knowledge. I know that the insights and experiences shared by professionals like you can significantly contribute to the success of our project.
 Additionally, we are considering deploying SD-Access, do you recommend its implementation in our deployment.
 So, I kindly request your suggestions, tips, and best practices.

                              <span>So, I just installed an IDF in an outbuilding. I installed a switch with a single Aruba AP. The AP comes up on the controller and even claims to have 5 clients with assigned IP addresses--2 of which are this laptop and my iPhone--, but none of them work.
 So rather than dumping my whole env on you guys, can you teach me how to fish? It looks like the traffic is blocked somewhere, as if the VLANs were aligned from point A to point B, i.e. AP to access switch to core switch to router.
 Current config:
  
MDF Core Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Untagged Tagged on the trunk port to the IDF (#51).
 IDF Access Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Tagged Untagged on ports 17-20 (with WAP in port 19) and Untagged Tagged on the trunk port #28 (SFP).
  
Context:
  
Here&#x27;s a network diagram and a sample of my VLAN config on the Core Switch.
 Core switch is TP-Link T1600-52PS.
 Access switch is the smaller 24-port version: TP-Link TL-SG2428P(new generation has diff model numbers, this used to be the T1600-28PS)
 VLAN 86 is Mgmt, 92 is Wifi, 99 is wall jacks (I didn&#x27;t pick &#x27;em: hold your applause)
  
Update 9:54 PM ET: I had the Tagged and Untagged labels backwards. Sorry for the confusion. Obviously, I don’t know what I’m doing.

                              <span>I am sure there is a reason for why we need RD and RTs separately. Reading up only gave vague distinctions but I haven&#x27;t got a convincing answer why on a real deployment, we would want RD and RTs , 2 different entities, to distinguish routes. Is my understanding correct here:
 Say, you have 2 tenants, say Coke and Pespi, each with say, a number of departments (accounting, sales, etc) connected to a DC. You would have separate RD for each tenant on the router there at the DC. (Route-leaking from Pepsi to Coke is a different concept that theoretically would only need RDs ?). 
 Coming back to question, we would want export and import RT configured, because, say one satellite office of Pepsi only has a sales dept (with import RT B) and wouldn&#x27;t routes from accounting dept (RT A), hence, RD: Distinguish a tenant, RT: export/import: Only import routes from a particular &#x27;group&#x27; of routes even from the same tenant. Does this sound correct?

                              <span>Hey guys just doing some research and II don&#x27;t think I understand over subscription rate on these ports. So is the subscription measured on the OLT port so say you have an XGSPON (10 gig port) and you spilt 1/64 do you sell each customer like say 300 meg and say that&#x27;s oversubscription rate of 100 present ? What is a typical over subscription rate? Is that bandwidth to each subscriber limited by the how may time you split or is configured on the port?

I&#x27;m planning to move one power supply to a new UPS battery backup. If I unplug one power supply, but the other power supply remains powered/unchanged, the switch and all its modules should stay completely online right? I only ask because in the past I had an issue with another brand chassis switch when I unplugged one of the two power supplies, several modules in the chassis powered off unexpectedly. Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m super frustrated and don&#x27;t know where to go next. On Thursday last week, we started having intermittent issues with our Comcast fiber service. As an example, we cannot get to finance.yahoo.com or secure.bankofamerica.com . HTTP/S , ping, trace route all fail. Some folks across the US cannot connect to the VPN (and some can). I put in a ticket and they blame our firewall (Barracuda). So, I put in a ticket with Barracuda, and they say it&#x27;s an ISP issue. We then plug a laptop directly into the fiber switch to bypass Barracuda, and still having Internet issues.
 Trace route always times out after hitting 96.110.117.181, which whois says is comcast routing.
 I then took our comcast cable connection going to our secondary network and plugged it into our firewall. I set it so that it would be the primary gateway instead of our fiber gateway. Traffic works just fine (it&#x27;s just slower). When I do a traceroute through the cable gateway, it takes a different route and does not hit 96.110.117.181.
 Comcast support keeps telling me the problem is our equipment and don&#x27;t want to seem to acknowledge the issue is their routing.
 Am I missing something here?

                              <span>in terms of NAC... the workstation is authenticated to the switch via dot1x, cool thats fine. But then the user logs in, and the switch reauths the port using the user&#x27;s dot1x. Whats to stop a user from just bringing a machine from home and passing their AD creds to dot1x and getting online? Can i prevent the machine from re-authing when the user logs in?

                              <span>Hi all,
 In our project we use PLC to control field devices with remote IO modules. This communication between PLC and remote IOs is handled by the PLC proprietary Ethernet protocol for SIL4 (safety integrity level).
 For troubleshooting reasons, we need to analyze the packets flowing between PLC and remote IOs so we set the port mirroring option in communication module of PLC. We can see other protocol packets with their respective IO IPs (i.e NTP) or ping packets. However, we can not capture the application data packets (UDP) with Wireshark. We tried port mirroring from both COM module and managed switch (to eliminate COM module mirroring feature bug) but no chance. Neither setup could capture data packets. Managed switch we used is Ruggedcom.
 Is there any restriction/limitation in port mirroring to not mirror the proprietary protocols or something? Are there anyone used this feature in industrial Ethernet environment?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I work in pro-av but I&#x27;m also our resident network engineer. I purchased a Fluke MS2-KIT back in 2012. It&#x27;s been great, but right now I am needing to replace several of the remote IDs and the #1 cap. 
 I know this means I need the MS2-IDK27 set and the MS2-WM. Both of these are very expensive replacements considering the cost I paid for the kit back in the day. I realize the same kit is almost double the cost now.
 I am considering moving to the LinkIQ kit, but I am wondering if there are better or more economical options that may or may not be Fluke. 
 I am obviously not going to put the money out for a DTX or full certification kit as this is a personal purchase. 
 What are you all using?

                              <span>One thing I&#x27;m struggling with is how this transition is made. I think traditionally someone would go out and get a CCIE/CCDE which would give them the knowledge to design and architect networks. Is this still the case? I recently renewed my CCNP and seems like I really had to drink the Cisco cool-aide on the most recent iteration of the test. I&#x27;m looking for more of a vendor agnostic fundamentals of network design and architecture.
 How many years experience would you say is required for this transition to take place?
 Because there is no Masters Degree is &quot;Network Architecture&quot; - what resources would you say give the best &quot;education&quot; in this pursuit?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have some Access Points connected to a Switch (HUAWEI in this case).
 I configured some trunk ports (with two VLANs) to some access point to propagate a GUEST network and a private network.
 Now I need to implement L2 port isolation ONLY for the GUEST network and leave the private network without isolation. Is this possible?
 Thanks.

 I was able to look over the shoulder of one of our level 3 technicians and I was really interested in learning more. I asked my team leader how if I could start being more involved with those types of tickets and was essentially laughed at for my lack of experience and while nobody said this directly I&#x27;ve felt that because I&#x27;m a woman and have no experience I won&#x27;t have the opportunity to move up.
 Once a month they let us look over a pallet of hardware before it goes to recycle and some of the guys grab servers for homelab type tinkering. I&#x27;m less interested …</span>

 I have a network containing of multiple VLANs. In this setup, I have a Mikrotik CCR1009 Router and a WireGuard GW Server (Box).
 In VLAN50, the Router has two IP addresses: a VRRP IP of 172.16.50.1 and a VLAN IP of 172.16.50.7. The WireGuard GW Server has the IP 172.16.50.100.
 I also have a NAS on VLAN70. In this VLAN, the Router has a VRRP IP of 172.16.70.1 and a VLAN IP of 172.16.70.7. The NAS has the IP 172.16.70.10.
 Now, I have a VPN Client connected to the WireGuard GW Server. The WireGuard GW Server has the IP 192.168.99.1 within the VPN, and the VPN Client has the IP 192.168.99.10.
 When the VPN Client (192.168.99.10) tries to access the NAS (172.16.70.10), it works, but there is a delay of several seconds to establish the TCP connection. When analyzing with Wireshark, I ca…</span>

                              <span>Good day all, As title says I am in need of a way to perform a factory reset of a CISCO Catalyst 3850 switch. The device was given out from a former contractor, but access is behind password, and we are not able to reconfigure it. We tried with both the Mode button in front, at startup, to access the flash_init to modify the config.text but that is write protected, and by the reset button in the back, all to no avail.
 Are there other ways to bring back the switch at a default configuration, either hardware or by CLI?
 Thanks to any reply.

                              <span>Hello guys, I hope you had a great weekend.
 I have to configure OSPF neighbouship between my MLS (multilayer switch) and my VPN concentrator for redundancy reasons.
 The issue is that the VPN concentrator&#x27;s public IP address is in the subnet of a secondary IP address of the MLS as illustrated in the following diagram :
 https://prnt.sc/DhSexwCBLcdz
 From what I know, OSPF only sends hello packets from the primary IP address. Meaning that even if I declare the 10.10.20.0 network in OSPF and make the interface active, VPN won&#x27;t receive any OSPF hello packet.
 What is the best way in that situation to form a neighbourship between these two devices?
 ​
 Thanks in advance, have a great week !

 My official job title is Information Technology Support Technician. Approximately 50% of my job is resolving tickets, however the other 50% of my job is building automations for our systems (SharePoint, security systems, inventory, ticketing system), interacting with vendors, managing inventory, managing AD and Azure, etc. I have a wide pretty wide range things I’m asked to work on. 
 I’m not trying to be the kid angling for a promotion, but had casual conversations with my boss, and he said he wasn’t sure if my current responsibilities were accurately reflected in my job title. Just curious what other people think.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have my certificate authority handing out Radius certs for the WiFi clients. I can see the initial connection is established using TCP 135 and then it will use a random RPC port range from 49152-65535. Is there a way I can have my certificate authority communicate over a small range of ports. I want to avoid opening up the entire 49152-65535 range to all my end user devices so that they can just enroll in a radius WiFi certificate.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere and can&#x27;t find an answer to my question. I also don&#x27;t have access to the tools (yet) or else I&#x27;d just figure it out myself. I hope I can ask this here btw...
 I&#x27;m a new IT Tech at my job and I&#x27;m looking for tools for my boss to get me (caz we don&#x27;t know where the last set went before me). I&#x27;m shopping on Amazon and having a tossup between kits (leaning towards some Klein Tools tho). 
 THE QUESTION: I&#x27;ve seen people do the opposite, using passthrough connectors with regular crimpers and just trimming the wires before the crimp. I wanna know, can I go the other way around and use a regular connector in a passthrough crimper? 
 Responses will dictate my buying decision, so please advise amd converse :)

                              <span>So I’m responsible for infrastructure at my workplace and we have a new boss. Leadership demanded we cover 7 days a week so we have shifted schedules to cover weekends, some of us also work ten hour shifts - the new boss doesn’t like it.
 He reaches out to our ISP to schedule a call to discuss a new location and instead of coordinating it for a time I’m scheduled to work, he schedules for a day I’m not working, acknowledges I’m not working in the email and another team mate (who knows nothing about our network) can join. 
 Later, he asks me in person to join if I can. I thought about it but I didn’t even get the meeting invite and no, It’s not urgent, It’s my day off. Waiting two days to have the call wouldn’t cause any problems. 
 I think he’s expecting me to work more than my 40 at this point on a regular basis. I don’t and I will fight to not to or be compensated with additional time off. We’ve already been short 2.5 people for almost a year and I’m behind on everything - I’m at the point where only the squeaky wheels are getting grease - 95% of my time is spent on helpdesk and I’m even falling behind on helpdesk tickets.
 I was looking for a new job but stopped to see how the new boss would work out and if he could get us back on track. Concerned, I might need to start looking again.

                              <span>Looking for advice here. So I am a younger guy currently working in helpdesk trying to move to a full sysadmin role. At my company, Head of IT has always encouraged me to grow. In my performance review last year, he said he wanted me in a sysadmin role by Fall of this year. My company offers a bonus/certification program that pays for and gives bonuses for passing certain exams. So I have been taking advantage of this program and getting the certs as others have done. Others have gotten these certs and no one has ever batted an eye about it. In the past 2 months, I have been doing a lot of studying and got 4 certs on our in our certification program. On the last 3, my boss has been really slow to respond about them and follow up with HR/Finance so I get the bonus. Now, after my last cert I got, he emailed me back quickly saying to stop getting certs for now and he needs to talk to the CTO about it. Someone on my team got the exact same certs and they were praised for it, but when I do I am told to stop? I am just trying to grow into the role that I want at this company and I am confused as to why he wants me to stop my growth. I mean I understand if he doesn&#x27;t want people taking advantage of the bonuses and then leaving, but I have been with this company the entirety of my career in IT (I am young so not that many years). 
 I understand I am in a unique situation and I don&#x27;t know if other companies offer things like this. Any advice? Am I overthinking? Should I ask him about it? All feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading.
 Edit: I don’t believe that it is budget or cost related. There have been other people in the past who have gotten certifications that grant bonuses that are double mine, and they were encouraged to keep going. I am leaning more that it is him wanting to protect the company and from people getting a bunch and then leaving.

                              <span>Work for smaller ISP that has recently started doing more B2B service. We’ve been whitelisting the few public IPs for port forwards to our ordering and provisioning systems and creating the tenant/admin account and allow those businesses/admins to complete all their own onboarding for their users. This is quickly becoming not scalable though. We are planning on setting up an SSL Web VPN page on a Fortigate with bookmarks to the individual services they need to access but trying to find a solution for the Fortigate VPN accounts. 
 Ideally we would create the single new admin account for the business and then allow them to create all their own users as they hire/fire. Trying to figure out the best solution for a Radius/LDAP server for the Fortigate to use for authentication that we can configure each tenant on and allow them to build/remove users without seeing the other tenants obviously. I tried to look at FreeIPA and it’s use of realms but that doesn’t seem to work as I expected it would. 
 Our current internal Radius server is just TACACS fed by a MySQL backend which is fine for us to run SQL query’s for the couple of user changes we have per year but that’s obviously not ideal for this B2B use case. 
 Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft released a patch to fix a Secure Boot bypass bug used by the BlackLotus bootkit we reported on in March. The original vulnerability, CVE-2022-21894, was patched in January, but the new patch for CVE-2023-24932 addresses another actively exploited workaround for systems running Windows 10 and 11 and Windows Server versions going back to Windows Server 2008.
 The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software&#x27;s system requirements.
 An attacker who successfully deployed BlackLotus on a targeted system could obtain complete control over the OS boot process—giving them “almost the same capabilities as firmware implants, but without having to overcome the multilevel SPI flash defenses…or the protections provided by hardware (like Intel Boot Guard),”

                              <span>Hey everyone, I seem to have a bad habit of jumping from the frying pan into the fire when accepting new roles these last few years. Examples are:
 ​
  
Roles listed as fully remote and put as fully remote in the contract, and then told two months in I need to relocate immediately or be fired
 Multiple managers fighting over what tasks I should be assigned and asking me to convince my managers to allow me to work on things or be dismissed (why did you hire me then?)
 Asked to frequently travel and told I will not be reimbursed
 Onboarding consisting of being given an employee ID and the phone number for the help desk; team leads too busy to do onboarding but will ask for status on projects I don&#x27;t even know about, etc
  
What kind of questions can someone ask during the interviews to try and suss out these kind of crazy situations? I understand this is a time of complete chaos for a lot of companies and onboarding in our field is always a bit sink or swim, but this is well beyond what I&#x27;m used to. One question I&#x27;m planning to ask next time is &quot;can you describe your onboarding process?&quot; and &quot;who will I report to? Are there multiple individuals I am expected to report to? If so, what strategies do you have to ensure alignment between their priorities?&quot;

                              <span>Hi, I am going to have a couple of servers to handle and I was thinking what would be some useful applications I can install to help me debug things faster? They will be running ubuntu server.
 There is already monitoring in place for cpu usage/memory/disk space/IO/etc.
 What I am looking for is more about is to extend my productivity perhaps with applications I have missed to know. e.g. I use top/htop/iotop for looking at processes, but maybe there is something better. I googled around, but either my search criteria is not good enough or there isn&#x27;t much more I can install to help myself out on dark days

                              <span>Full disclosure, I&#x27;m a security engineer. Definitely know my way around AD and Azure AD, but I&#x27;m nowhere near AD architect-level knowledge, so this could be a stupid question/scenario. 
 My Company, Company A, is cloud only. Newer company, acquiring other smaller companies and then having to integrate their environments into our own. 
 No on-prem AD, just Microsoft 365 and Azure AD/InTune. 
 ​
 We acquire Company B and they DO have an on-prem AD domain.
 So we need to be able to have our Company A admins perform tasks on the legacy laptops as a domain admin would, but the users also still need to be able to be on their Company B domain in the meantime until the merger of all the things is actually complete and the people are fully moved to Company A resources (or get new laptops).

                              <span>Hello reddit. Sometimes my coworkers make me feel crazy.
 Here&#x27;s an example. I have been tasked with setting up a new server. Currently, a large amount of employees use software that relies on a server. We&#x27;re planning on replacing the server. I was wanting to use DNS to point to the new server using the old server&#x27;s name to avoid having to reconfigure a large number of computers and applications.
 My coworkers don&#x27;t like the idea. They would like to update all the computers and applications instead. I&#x27;m concerned about missing some computers and having upset employees.
 In addition, I proposed that we could update all the applications with a new name for the server, but use something more generic than the servers name so that when we do this next time, we won&#x27;t have this problem. My coworkers didn&#x27;t like that either.
 Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink my strategies?

 I have a very interesting case study for my university to do and I am wondering if there is any comprehensive tutorial on how to configure a HA iSCSI storage (working in ActivePassive mode) using the Pacemaker and the DRBD. Unfortunately I am completely green at using the Pacemaker and the DRBD and frankly I don&#x27;t have time to learn it. Can You please help me? I will take any useful information there is. Thank You in advance :D

What makes it tougher is that when he’s well slept he’s an awesome workmate. I’m responsible for him but I’m not sure how to discuss it with him. I’d like to keep HR out of it.

I have Kevlar &quot;chinos&quot; and plain black protective mid tops(think converse is but just all black with a tan sole). I can leave my jacket in a luggage case on the bike too. 
 So I should pretty much look the normal part when I&#x27;m interfacing with them, I&#x27;m just curious if they saw or it came up if it might come off poorly or reflect against my company. 
 I&#x27;m probably over thinking this and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine, I just would like to hear other people&#x27;s thoughts. The big motivation I have for this is two fold: I get milage reimbursed and my bike gets like 60mpg VS my explorer getting 18-20mpg, so I&#x27;ll make out good on it. Secondly, I just like to ride and every mile on the bike is a good one.

Cisco
 Arista
 Huawei
 H3C 
  
Cisco and aritsa are super expensive where we are. Huawei and H3C are super affordable. 
 Anyones got experience with the two? And which is better?

                              <span>I was trying to corelate Cisco NXOS and Linux networking stack. Is the NVE interface in Cisco terminology for NXOS same as what Linux VxLAN device is? For Linux, my understanding is , VxLAN device is a virtual interface that we create, attach this device and the real interface that servers/hosts are connected to a bridge interface. Is VxLAN config is Cisco, the way we assign VLAN a unique VNID, then assign this VNID to an NVE , similar? Is this understanding correct? Thanks

 Whats the exactly technical difference in a use/case in which I have minimum 2x ISPs/WAN.
 With both configuration I can hit the goal to push my connection trough a specific WAN-Interface ? Or am I wrong ?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m in the middle of migrating our current WAN facing firewalls (ASA and Firepower) to Palo Alto 3320&#x27;s. With Firepower, the concept of &quot;trying&quot; (because, Firepower) to block a URL is a case of putting the URL on the rule, then block/allow depending. At the moment, I&#x27;ve mimicked the Firepower structure, in the sense that I&#x27;ve created the URL Category entries and applied them to the Security Rules. Apologies for not having this completely accurate, but I did a POC last with Palo Alto and I remember that it wasn&#x27;t as straightforward as building out the rules like I have currently. There where &quot;dependencies&quot; and other categories involved in order for it to work. I&#x27;ve forgot exactly how I went about perfecting it in the end. I think I had the URL rules setup like I do currently, but I had a catch all for low risk categories etc... at the bottom, so the rest of the webpage URL&#x27;s can be downloaded to.
 I know the rule setup in Palo Alto isn&#x27;t as straightforward or &quot;obvious&quot; as say, Firepower, I know Firepower sucks overall, but I need to wrap my head around the best way to structure rules for the Palo again.

                              <span>I installed EVE-NG after having massive issues getting Cisco FTDv and FMCv running in GNS3. I managed to get both VMs up and running, but for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out how to get connectivity between the two devices. 
 One issue is that when I built a &quot;network&quot;, and drag connections to the FTD/FMC, it does not provide me any options to declare &quot;which&quot; interface I want to connect to. If I could do that, it would not matter which network I built between them, it should work. I don&#x27;t need internet access from the VMs, I just want them to talk to each other. 
 Now, this is not that big of an issue on the FMC, as there only seems to be one interface connected, and I have put it on the same network as the FTDv. 
 But I think the core issue is.. From the look of the interfaces, both devices are using loopbacks as the interface connected to switch in EVE-NG. I don&#x27;t want to change the IPs on those interfaces, for fear that I lose the ability to console into the devices, which is currently working through the EVE-NG web console.
 ​
 On both FMCv and FTDv, both eth0 interfaces are configured for the desired management network. But the Transmit/Receive statistics on these interface show they are not connected in EVE-NG. So, given I don&#x27;t seem to have the ability to specify which interfaces on the VM I want to use, how on earth do I connect the two eth0 interfaces in EVE-NG?

                              <span>Hello All,
 I work at a medium-sized company (4-5K Corporate Users with about 50 US-based offices) that is working towards moving to SDWAN. Currently today we run on full Cisco Hardware - C8Ks, ISR 4Ks, and Cat 3850 and 9K Switches, with no other vendor hardware deployed at our branches. Within our Datacenter we have a pair of c8500s that aggerate our WAN Connections and run as DMVPN Hubs. We run a legacy design at all our branches with MPLS running as the Primary Transport and DMVPN as the Failover if we experience LEC or provider issues on the MPLS side. With this design, we route all traffic external to the branch to our main Hub no matter the destination… Internet or On-Prem infrastructure. Years ago, this was great for us because we only had to manage one firewall pair that handled al…</span>

                              <span>Over the last few months, I researched cloud WAN architectures (think of Azure OneWAN, so private infra between sites, i.e., PoPs or datacenters). The more I research them, the more I am convinced that they are really just like big (e.g., Tier 1 AS) internet service provider (ISP) networks. Cloud service providers (CSPs) face the same challenges and appear to use fundamentally similar technologies, except that they might be more &quot;agile&quot; in adopting new tech such as the latest flavor of SDN. Both do traffic estimation, traffic engineering, many CSPs also use MPLS tunnels like many ISPs, etc.
 Thus, my question: What are differentiating factors between a CSP WAN (think Azure&#x27;s OneWAN) and a large ISP network?

                              <span>had ssd fail in bay0, (yes, not raid, I know).. had remote worker replace it, I see the drive. I have built Server 2019 USB w/ Rufus, I can boot it in both Legacy and UEFI. I can get past initial install (Copying files...). but I&#x27;m sitting here on the 2nd boot, where I&#x27;d expect the welcome screen.. instead I see a windows flag and spinning dots circle below. it&#x27;s been 20min. server must be booting wrong partition? what is supposed to boot &quot;windows boot manager&quot; partition??
 server is a Supermicro, maybe 6 years old. IPMI is working great.
 EDIT: waited.. maybe 90min.. all good!

                              <span>relatively new to cloud support so I&#x27;m at a loss on what to do on this one. 
 I was able to setup and deploy a Mac Pro from ABM and assign it a profile in Azure. Setup went smooth and it pulled down all the required apps and management profile. One of the required apps is our company portal.
 When I open up Company Portal it tells me it hasnt been set up for corporate use yet and to begin setup. It then wants to download and install the same management profile that was installed during automatic enrollment so it fails and I can&#x27;t use company portal.
 When I check azure it shows the device has been enrolled and is compliant so I&#x27;m at a loss how to bypass this check by company portal. I even tried to go and assign it through portal.manage.microsoft.com and that didn&#x27;t help.

                              <span>Question - not sure if you guys have seen this - but I&#x27;m upgrading a pair of nexus from 9.2.3 to 10.2.5 with a 320gb lag going down to the array (160 per switch).Running physical cables not optics/fiber.While upgrading nexus primary member to 10.2.5; all four 40gb interfaces would not come up nor would they even show a transceiver was even connected. I opened a case with pure and they restarted the switch service, and bounced the nics (cuz we have no option to) and nothing came up.I rolled back my config and the vPC came right up on the primary.opening a case as we speak; but wasn&#x27;t sure if anyone saw the same issue.I did previously configure &quot;service unsupported&#x3D;transceiver&quot; so that shouldn&#x27;t have been an issue and everything was working prior to upgrade.Wasn&#x27;t sure if anyone had run into this?
