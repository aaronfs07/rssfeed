                              <span>Hello,
 currently RAID 6 Degraded with 2 Disk failed. We changed two times (Two spare kicked in rebuild starts auto ), but the rebuild failed after some hours. 
 The RAID has two Controllers , one is not working and a another spare Controller did not work.
 The data can still be access, but I have no ideas what to do.
 What I have read in forums and articles is not good 
 Some have an Idea?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in a few different positions at some level of Sysadmin/Systems Engineer for the past 10 years or so, have a 4 year degree in IT. I have worked in an array of different industries, most notably finance, manufacturing, and media.
 My previous position had me in DevOps engineering where I was able to master Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-code best practices. Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that &quot;burn-out&quot; point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.
 A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.
 Pros: Finally getting paid what I&#x27;m worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!
 Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one&#x27;s even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. 
 I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. 
 Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn&#x27;t a good fit after all?

                              <span>Hello!
 I work for an employer with a number of different sites. The organization&#x27;s main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50&#x27;s voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. 
 At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We&#x27;re planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We&#x27;re undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We&#x27;re also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.
 Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What&#x27;s worked in your experience? We don&#x27;t have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

 I have a set of GS meraki go switches and GR wireless APs on which I’m trying to configure VLANs for GUEST network. I have a Firewalla which i set up in router mode but it doesn’t seem like i can configure VLANs on my Meraki GO equipment without a GX router. Is that correct?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Network Engineer for Municipal ISP. We currently have a /23 and /22 from ARIN. I&#x27;m planning for when we need more addresses. There are several options and I&#x27;d like to ask your opinion to see what your experiences have been.
 We could go down the road of CGNAT. Very expensive and we are a small shop with no experience with this technology.
 NAT6to4 seems easy enough to configure, but I worry about to scalability and robustness.
 We also have the option to lease additional /20 IP space for ~ 0.20c and IP per year with a 5 year term. Cheap, but not a long term solution.
 Then there is the option of getting IPv6 space form ARIN and using IPv6 exclusively. Without complete internet adoption of IPv6 I worry about routing and reachability issues to organizations that aren&#x27;t at least dual stacked.
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Maybe this is an obvious answer, maybe it’s not; but what was the first stratum 1 clock set to?
 I get that we’ve got very accurate clocks that can detect the passing of microseconds based on radioactive decay, but how was the first one given an active time and then set to run??

                              <span>Hi we have one later 3 switch with 2 vlans, 2 SVI for those vlans with ip pim sparse mode command under it. One access switch hanging of that later 3 switch with same vlans and igmp snooping enabled. 
 Do i need to anything to enable inter vlan multicast? I believe because the layer 3 interfaces are on same switch i don&#x27;t even need RP . 
 I can see igm querer on both switches for both vlans.
 Please correct me if I&#x27;m missing something.

                              <span>I have an HP L3 switch connected to a Cisco L3 switch and am in the process of migrating SVIs. They are connected via 2x10G links in an LACP port-channel. This trunk carries a number of VLANs. There are devices hanging off of the Cisco switch with the HP core still handling the routing, and that all works fine.
 I created a test VLAN on each switch and added it to the trunk on both ends, with the intention of testing the SVI on the Cisco switch and only L2 on the HP side. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s coincidence that this is happening with the test VLAN, but I can&#x27;t get the test VLAN to pass any traffic across the trunk. Devices connected to the Cisco switch can talk to the SVI, but anything on the other side of the trunk can&#x27;t connect. I&#x27;ve done variations of testing and essentially, any devices on that test VLAN can talk to each other unless they are physically located on the other side of the trunk. I&#x27;ve moved the SVI to the HP side and anything on HP side is now able to talk to the SVI and anything on Cisco can no longer talk to it.
 If I run a packet capture on a device from either side, it sends ARPs and gets no replies, furthering my suspicion that this is just a L2 trunk issue.
 I suspect there is some sort of bug with this VLAN not getting passed because I added it later than other VLANs. I plan to shut and no shut the port on the Cisco switch during a window. I have encountered something similar when using VTP in the past.
 Just wondering if I&#x27;m missing something - this seems fairly basic so I&#x27;m astounded it&#x27;s causing such an issue.
 EDIT: No VTP in use. The Cisco switch is a pair of stacked 9500s, and the trunk port is cross-chassis etherchannel.

I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to connect to the bootflash by removing it and connecting it to a computer. My thought was a USB to eUSB cable but not seeing much in the way of online offerings. Would this even be possible?

                              <span>I am trying to design a network for a tether to a vehicle. The original plan was to have a tether cable with two single mode fiber cables and have the cables running in full-duplex which is something I have done before. The network is very simple as in the image.
 The problem now is that due to supply issues is that we can only source a tether with a single fiber single mode. I have not set up a network like this before. Is it possible to still set up the same design using half-duplex mode. I have the following questions:
  
What type of media converter do I need to look for? The one I was going to use was https://www.mpl.ch/t2875.html since it needs to be small to fit the vehicle. But I am guessing the 100Base-FX or 1000Base-X are not compatible with half-duplex.
 What type of transceiver/connector would be best to use since I can no longer just use the LC Duplex connector?
 Are there any special considerations for the router/switch that I need to use to support half-duplex the original plan was to use a tiny unmanaged switch. But not I am not so sure that is possible https://botblox.io/products/gigablox-small-gigabit-switch
  
Is my idea still possible or do I need to abandon it now?
 Thanks

 I see them sometimes and curious what they exactly mean?
 I assume the idle timeout means after 30 min if no activity is occuring on the vpn that it deletes the tunnel?

 I might have kind of a &quot;silly&quot; question.
 I run three routers connected to my core router within area 0 - everything works perfect. 
 Do I need to create stub areas for my local attached networks where no additional router is being used or can/should be regular networks where PCs, laptops and so on are located ignored?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed while building out some ansible automation that some of the modules take a very long time to complete runs. The main issue here is that it is slowing down the control plane and affecting some SNMP alerting. The main culprit here is the &quot;no shut&quot; command or rather enabling/disabling ports. 
 I&#x27;ve tried using the ansible module only for enabling ports, as a shutdown command is visible in the configuration and does not run. Templates for the rest of the configurations.
 I&#x27;ve tried using a template to speed up runs, which does help a bit, but still requires applying no shutdown to all ports in a switch stack. This takes a significant amount of time.
 ​
 Has anyone run into this type of problem with automating switch configurations? Should I look at another feature within ansible or perhaps use a separate tool to manage port status (maybe pulling facts? Or using napalm? Direct API commands?) ? I haven&#x27;t seen anything that will allow the no shutdown command to be present in the configuration, but it would be a nice to have feature.

                              <span>Has anyone setup a portal that your end users can access that will perform some basic connectivity test for them? I&#x27;m thinking of something that I could fairly safely put on the internet that could perform some very basic test like: your computer can reach the VPN portal! Your latency is &quot;GOOD&quot;. Your speed is &quot;BAD&quot;.
 Also - does anyone set (and enforce) minimum standards for internet connectivity for remote users?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m working with a company with several small branch offices. They have older Junipers that work as their gateway/firewall/edge router and VPN gateway. I&#x27;m trying to swap out these all-in-one appliances slowly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like any new VPNs want to connect to the older Junipers. Any advice? It&#x27;s a hub-and-spoke setup.
 I&#x27;m thinking that the best way to proceed is to start in their central office by connecting a new appliance to the old, passing it a single public IP (1to1) at first, then slowly moving over other IPs, the branch VPNs, and services as time and budget permits. Eventually, the new appliance would be doing all the work. At that point, remove the old appliance and plug the new one directly into the ISP&#x27;s modem. 
 Is there a more common way to work through this scenario? Are there any gotchas? The project is not a rush and I assume it&#x27;ll take a couple of months to complete. If we were just talking about a few offices, I&#x27;d get everything provisioned, take them down on a Friday evening, and be done by the following Monday, but there are just too many branches to coordinate that over a single weekend. Thoughts?

                              <span>I’m working with a new ISP based in the UK, we are v6 first where we can. I have hit a block on CPEs. 
 Our main requirements are that it supports 464XLAT (specifically CLAT), tr-069 and has WiFi 5 minimum. If they are mesh devices great. It’s not a disaster if they aren’t. 
 I’ve spoken to Draytek, they have confirmed to me that they don’t support and are not looking to support 464. We are currently using some TP-link mesh boxes for lab testing though they don’t support 464 either though they are being cagey with me in regards to their roadmap. 
 Budgets are a bit above my pay grade, this is just POC work at the moment. 
 I know that OpenWRT supports it. But that brings a host of issues that I’d rather not have to deal with in a prod environment.

                              <span>Hello Everybody
 As in the past there were some Topics about beeing or becomming a Network Architect, i have written some clarification.
 First of we need to differentiate between: architect, designer and engineer.
 Those three, lets call them Functions (NOT job descriptions!), have different tasks, responsibilities and so need different know how! Also they relate to each other and if you are a engineer, it is not to be said that you have not also overlapping with the other two - vise-versa. as an Example, a Designer can also be the engineer.
 To clarify:
 The architect is responsible for strategic decisions for the next 3-5 years. His taks involve in getting the requirements from the business stakeholders, helping in creating the IT strategy, helping to connect the network to other BU and…</span>

                              <span>So on our network we have a WSA. When people come into our building to use VPNs, we have to add their VPN urls to a bypass list. From my understanding, we do this because we currently don&#x27;t have any public certs, and it is temporary.
 My question though is about Cisco Anyconnect. Usually we add the url that the VPN connects to but yesterday I ran into an issue. The person who was trying to connect, their any connect box on their screen just had a name of the server they were connecting to, not an IP or url.
 What would be the best way then to find the IP or URL in this case? When we went to the any connect settings , they were all blank because he was not connected.
 Our way of getting it to work was his wife, who was working remotely and also on the same VPN, sent a screen shot of her settings and from there we were able to get the server IP.
 But I am just curious what would have been the best way to find the IP or URL? Is there a file I can look at on the users PC? Like I said, when we went to his any connect settings, they were all blank beacuse he was not connected.
 Thanks

                              <span>Switches always have a Mpps rating - from small ones to data center ones. Why don&#x27;t routers have it too? It should be pretty predictable, especially when ASICs are involved. When it comes to firewalls the answer seems obvious - it probably depends on what the firewall is configured to do (and it may do a lot).

                              <span>I have this lab that pushes out huge images, &gt; 200gb through Symantec ghost. The source is on the same vlan as the clients. It runs into issues: slow transfer rate (it takes 3+ hours to finish, sometimes it’ll fail when it’s almost done. My shift would be over before I find out that the image failed so troubleshooting is very tedious!
 Anyway, any imaging/switching experts can offer any advice? I think this is a job for multicast but I’m not too familiar. We use Aruba 6300 switches. The vlan they’re using has igmp snooping and pim-sparse configured. If there’s a quick and dirty fix I’ll take it! If there’s something in the ghost software I need to tweak I’m all for it! Anything to avoid using a clean switch and cabling everything to it (that’s their idea btw)

                              <span>I have 3 AD. One in cloud. Two on prem. Recently promoted the Cloud to become Primary holding all FSMO role.
 Initially all replication are doing well. 
 Recently start popping error of sysvol failed to replicate followed by AD changes not showing on PDC despite DFS, repadmin, dcdiag and dfsdiag not showing any error at all. 
 Currently clueless on what to do. 
 PDC is hosted on AWS. Built fron scratch on Server 2019.
 Member server are Server 2016 which u will call SDC1 &amp; SDC2
 Additional info.
 Sync between SDC1 and SDC2 are doing fine.
 Tried performing repadmin /syncall /AdeP and replicate from option in ADSS on PDC but still not showing latest changes (new computer object and user creation)
 UPDATE 1: If i perform repadmin /syncall on PDC it goes straight to syncall finished without showing the usual replication is in progress information.
 Update 2: will temporary put it as solved. As i realize its Inter-Site and not Intra-Site hence the default replication timing is 3 hours. But will keep a look out if problem still shows will do a ADFS restore.

 Anyone else have any other good options?

 The issue is that I cannot edit a field when using a lookup value. So basically the computer name is in a list as a lookup field and I need to edit the return date.
 Everytime I try and work the script it tells me the system object cannot be converted to the pnp-pipeline. I will edit and post the code tomorrow but I&#x27;m hoping this I&#x27;d enough to jog someone&#x27;s brain so I can try in the AM. Thank you.

 format looks the same including the signature and picture in the signature.
 I am trying to get the headers but still waiting. The spoofed email address was the using the actual domainname but with a S added to the domainname. the new domain name was registered yesterday about 2 hours after the original email arrived to end customer. somewhere over in Iceland registered on namecheap
 is there a way to figure out if this is happening on MS servers? has anyone run into this?
 is it a possible virus on end users system? we scanned senders computer with 2 different antivirus its clean. checkout firewall log files, it has antivirus, threat protection and web filtering. nothing found and no weird traffic
 TIA

                              <span>All this talk about how the November CU update was breaking domain authentication in environments where RC4 was explicitly disabled via group policy sent me down a rabbit hole.
 My environment wasn&#x27;t affected, but it made me curious about WHY so many have disabled RC4. TLDR; it&#x27;s less secure than AES256.
 Step 1) audit your domain controllers for RC4 in use. Just replace DC01 with the name of your domain controller. 0x17 events means RC4 is being used.
 Get-WinEvent -LogName &#x27;Security&#x27; -ComputerName &#x27;DC01&#x27; -FilterXPath &quot;*[System[EventID&#x3D;4769] and EventData[Data[@Name&#x3D;&#x27;TicketEncryptionType&#x27;]&#x3D;&#x27;0x17&#x27;]]&quot; 
 What this uncovered is that Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments was using RC4 (it creates a computer object called AZUREADASSOACC). I guess the reason for this was that until sometime in 2020 AES wasn&#x27;t supported?? So if you use Azure AD Connect, you might want to look into this to improve security.
 Anyway, this article nicely outlines the steps needed to get Azure AD Connect using AES https://azuregeek.io/en/secure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac/?q&#x3D;%2Fen%2Fsecure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac%2F
 After following these steps &amp; rolling over my Kerberos decryption keys I now see Azure AD SSO now using AES (0x12 in the event log)

                              <span>Just ran into WU failing to install some updates with 0x800f0922 error code.
 Googled it and these failures are fairly common, but the &quot;solutions&quot; are all over the place. The most common one is to disable secure boot in the BIOS. Another one from this thread is to enable AppReadiness service. Plus the regular assortment of &quot;sfc /scannow&quot; and &quot;dism /restorehealth&quot; voodoo, and all the way up to updating BIOS and what not.
 The PSA is this - all of this is nonsensical. 0x800f0922 is a generic error meaning &quot;the installer failed&quot;.
 To understand the cause you need to skim though %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log and find the first error that then triggers a cascade of failures culminating in 0x800f0922.
 In our case it was that ... drumroll ... %System32%\Macromed\Flash directory was missing. Created it, re-run updates - et voila - all updates went through.

 When trying to set up a Microsoft 365 sandbox domain myself I found some of the documentation out of date, so this is a quick guide to setting up a sandbox domain for Microsoft 365 development.
 Why would you want to do this?​
 I personally needed this for recording a screencast of the process to install Corso. While recording myself going through permission settings in M365, I didn’t want to unintentionally reveal PII for my team members or other sensitive data.
 Another reason to do this is if you’re looking to level up both your skills and want to experiment with being the admin in your own space rather than impacting other users on a production domain. It’s also a good step to experiment with owning your own identity.
 Finally, this might also be useful i…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve reached out to support about this a few times since May, but it&#x27;s gotten worse recently. Essentially, barracuda has an internal list of senders and IPs it marks as -1000 and does not apply filtering to normally. This is obviously a problem, but if this list was EXTREMELY well curated, it would probably be fine. However, it is not. It whitelists all salesforce IPs for example, even if it&#x27;s a newly set up gmail etc. There are a lot of ways to exploit this list that I&#x27;ve observed since reporting the issue and just two weeks ago we had something very malicious make it through. I am not going to list every single way in which this list is easily exploited, but if you dig into it on your side you will very quickly see how someone could easily take advantage of it just by knowing it&#x27;s there …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m just curious I was working with the security specialist and I believe I was very nice to him. I am not familiar with all the terminology, so I sometimes may use the wrong Jargon. The security specialist has a &quot;put me in my place&quot; kind of attitude. I just took it as a learning experience, but the attitude is not needed. I&#x27;m a grown man I make mistakes I don&#x27;t know everything..I am a dummy and trying to get the work done. Give me some kind of respect please ..I don&#x27;t talk to you that way. I know when I work with customers I do not give them that same attitude that I&#x27;m given within the IT group. We treat customers with respect why do we not extend that same courtesy with each other?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m upgrading an infrastructure from Exchange 2016 to 2019 and will be creating a new DAG and new file witness server. Currently its on a server 2016 VM, but this seems overkill and apparently for a 2019 cluster, you can use anything that supports SMB2. I was thinking of using ubuntu server, but is there an even lighter OS I could use? preferably some kind of lightweight NAS VM that supports SMB2.
 Thanks

We have had this happen on four different ones, but the fifth so far is stable. We have 99 sitting on a pallet. 
 It seems they are having a Direct X crash (see below)
 Eventlog shows:

 We are at our wits end on this. Tech support is no help and drivers are all up to date. Ideas?

                              <span>Hi there,
 For many months we have been trying like everyone else to strengthen the security of our infrastructure and one of the many, many points to improve is to no longer use the domain administrator (the default one).
 The necessary was done but I noticed that it was still used. After reading the events I found the origin of the problem: a SQL server. Every evening when performing the backup jobs, the following logs appear :
 https://i.postimg.cc/bNnmqtHH/sql.jpg
 I&#x27;ve checked everywhere (in jobs, in SQL Server service accounts) and I don&#x27;t see our domain admin populated.
 Any idea how to prevent it from being used ? I wonder if SQL Server was installed with this domain admin and if the problem can come from there.
 Thanks !

Before fully starting the project I&#x27;d like to have a rollback plan in place in case something decides to go wrong. I&#x27;ve poked around online but can&#x27;t seem to find anything decent relating to my situation. Most are articles I&#x27;ve found are hybrid Exchange rollbacksand I&#x27;m not sure they would apply to our situation. We are migrating from Exchange 2013 to 2019.

 Appreciate the feedback in advance!

 We need a texting platform for sending out cancellation alerts, but also for allowing members of our HR department to text with potential candidates without having to use cell phones. 
 Anyone have any systems they like, before I go hit G2?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 So, long story short, we had an ask from our company to take our external contractor AD Users and run Enable-RemoteMailbox on them. We quickly found out that was not what should have been done and they should have had the command, Enable-MailUser run on them as they are external contractors and we simply want to have them as AD Users that have an external email address that mail is resolved to.
 Okay, simple enough I thought. So, I went ahead and ran the following for each user that was affected:
 Disable-RemoteMailbox -Identity  -Confirm:$false
 Enable-MailUser -Identity  -ExternalEmailAddress 
 We also wanted their Email field in the General tab of AD to match their UPN, so after running the above commands, AND before AAD sync happened (unfortunately) we updated their Email field to match that of their UPN. When we run the Enable-MailUser is makes their Email property their external email address. Well, that appears to have messed up those users where now On-prem they are showing as MailUsers, but in 365 they are showing still as a UserMailbox for RecipientType.
 We are struggling to get this update on both ends. So far, I have tried taking one of the users and running Disable-MailUser, letting that sync over to 365 and then running Enable-MailUser again. No luck. I have tried having the user set up as a MailUser On-prem and then stop syncing them with 365. Once they are no longer synced, I then re-sync them, but again, no luck.
 What&#x27;s even stranger is we noticed that when we disable them On-prem as a MailUser, and then re-sync them, one property keeps getting written back it would seem from 365 to On-prem...
 Within the user&#x27;s proxyAddresses, one address shows up. The x500? I&#x27;m wondering if I am missing a step here or if something else needs to be updated for these users to finally sync up as a MailUser On-prem as well as in 365? Thanks everyone!

                              <span>We recently went from an on-prem Exchange server to Microsoft 365. We still have On-Prem AD using AAD Connect to sync with 365. PC&#x27;s are a mix of Windows 10/11, all installed with Office 365. Whenever we have a new user logon, the system tries to load Outlook 2016 and connect to our old Exchange server (FYI, this is no longer turned on) My question is how does Windows try and load the 2016 version of something that isn&#x27;t installed and what setting do I need to turn off to stop it trying to connect to old Exchange?
 All our DNS records are correct and pointing to 365. In the interim of swapping systems we had to have an Autodiscover GPO which is now deleted.
 Any help appreciated

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve inherited an AD with company.com as internal AD domain as well es external domain name. Right now the external records (e.g. www.company.com) are just placed inside the default &quot;company.com&quot; zone inside the AD DNS.
 Is there currently any Best Practise way to keep external records automatically up2date inside the AD zone?
 There might be some way to automate this with powershell (lookup external records and set internal records accordingly) but this feels a bit too hacky.
 Best case would be to tell AD to lookup the records on the external DNS if the internal DNS does not have any records. As far as I understand by default AD doesn&#x27;t forward those requests since only the internal DNS is authoritative for &quot;company.com&quot;?
 It&#x27;s probably not as simple as adding the external name server to &quot;Properties -&gt; Nameserver&quot; on the AD I guess?
 Is there any way around this problem or do you just have to live with manually maintaining those external records on the internal DNS?
 I&#x27;ve also seen you can do zone transfers from AD to a specific server. Could you instead do a zone transfer from external to internal? (Without it overwriting all the internal records)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Auditing Teams membership changes can help admins ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. By regularly auditing membership changes, organizations can identify and address any potential security risks.
 Since Audit log search has limited customization, I have written a PowerShell script to track Teams membership changes with advanced capabilities.
 You can download the script from GitHub.
 Script Highlights:
  
The script uses modern authentication to retrieve audit logs.
 Exports all the teams’ membership changes
 The script has a filter to track private channel membership changes separately.
 It has a filter to monitor shared channel membership changes separately.
 Allows you to generate an audit report for a custom period.
 It can be executed with an MFA enabled account too.
 Exports report results to CSV file.
 Automatically installs the EXO V2 module (if not installed already) upon your confirmation.
 The script is scheduler-friendly. I.e., Credentials can be passed as a parameter instead of saved inside the script.
  
If you have any suggestion or additional requirements, I will update them in the next version.

                              <span>Hi guys, there are a few posts on the web regarding this question, but all of them are 5+ years old without any usable solution...
 To keep it short- We have Active Directory in our company, with 300+ machines, of which ~50 are laptops.
 We have bad practices in the company - most of the laptop users don&#x27;t bring laptops to the company (thus not connecting to the company LAN, not updating group policy, and some custom software) for long periods of time.
 The general idea is to FORCE them to bring laptops to the company once in a while (every 15-20 days) by automatically expiring their cached domain credentials after X days or X logins. Since M$ till this day doesn&#x27;t offer any option to achieve this, I am wondering if maybe somebody had a similar situation and if there maybe is some workaround to achieve this?
 We have VPN (Checkpoint), but also can&#x27;t force users to use it (also no option to keep it constantly connected- which by itself is also bad idea because there would be a lot of incoming traffic on servers).

                              <span>Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t belong here but hoping you guys can help me out. I want to use Win8.1 on an old PC, without patching it and it will even lose support at the start of next year. Now, I don&#x27;t have anything important on it and really isn&#x27;t a big deal whatever happens to the system, but I would like to know what even could happen. How does an unpatched system get infected if I&#x27;m just on the internet using an updated browser? Everywhere I read that missing security updates is a big no no, but I want to know how. If I used trusted updated software, don&#x27;t download and run anything shady, how does my system get infected then? Can my browser security just get bypasses or what?

                              <span>Hi everyone, A little bit of my background before the real question: I&#x27;ve been working for 3 years in my current company (&gt;500 employees located around the world) started as a jr. sysadm, and now, after a lot of work and study, my team is pushing me to become the &quot;Exchange guy&quot;. I&#x27;m really happy about this, considering that I fell in love with it. Recently, we had some internal &quot;problems&quot; with the cybersec team (which is not in the IT dept anymore), and the question of the day is &quot;who should do what?&quot; Now that a lot of stuff has been migrated in the Purview portal, I think it&#x27;s harder to identify who should have access to it and, in particular, define all the permissions. I think both the exchange admin and the security admin should have access to the portal, and it&#x27;s mandatory that both the part talks before making any changes. What do you think/how do you handle this in your company?

 Hi, looking for a little advice. I&#x27;m wondering on the best path to go down with this..
 I have a new client who is still running SBS 2011 (I know, I know..), thankfully Exchange has been decommissioned and they are on 365 for mail. So it&#x27;s basically just an old file server which needs to be replaced at some stage with something modern.
 However they still use the Remote Desktop facility built into SBS2011. They would like to keep this if possible or some new variation of it. Is it still supported in newer versions of Windows Server?
 Thanks for any advice

                              <span>Hello,
 Mostly we use windows ltsc. We had some windows 10 pro computers and after upgrading computers to 21h1, some computers started to have problem when outlook tries connect Exchange server (we use 2016). It shows disconnected.
 I saw a reddit topic and and question topic to microsoft with same problem. But there is no solution.
 Only fix 
  
close outlook
 disable other network adapters
 open again outlook (outlook connects)
 enable network adapters again
  
Is there anyone who faced this problem and found solution.
 Thanks.

 I modified the files of the driver but windows does not allow to install.

 Would putting second email provider on a subdomain (@mail2.corp.eu) cause any issues?
 Apologies if this isn&#x27;t the correct place to ask.
 Setting up email with the second provider is just a single MX record, but I don&#x27;t want to risk it possibly damaging the Exchange/Outlook 365 setup.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I am currently trying to implement a MFA Solution for the company I work with. While Fido2 works just fine on a Desktop Enviroment to secure the M365 access it&#x27;s utterly useless when the User has to work on a Terminal Server, because the Server does (for whatever reason) not recognise the Key so the User can&#x27;t login into their M365 while working on the Terminal Server.
 And sadly mandating the Authenticator App on the private phone of an employee is not possible (legally), so I am looking for a solution that works on Terminal Servers to secure the M365 access.

                              <span>My environment either needs a local repo or just to proxy the apt packages. The main repo server will be the only one able to go out to the web, everything else has to point at it for their packages/updates.
 100% ubuntu environment with server and desktop
 I&#x27;ve played with aptly in the past but the process of having to do the mirrors/snapshots and publishing and everything can be a bit of a hassle to update the repos often. Not major gripe but it&#x27;s just something.
 Apt-cacher-ng as a proxy seems promising as well. Haven&#x27;t used it but pretty straight forward.
 Would it be better to just utilize the proxy instead of storing an entire mirror of all ubuntu repos locally? I feel it would be, since that would be a huge waste of space if we only use maybe 20% of the actual packages in the repo. Not going to waste time figuring out exactly what packages each system uses but if we utilize the proxy then it can cache what&#x27;s needed and other systems can just grab from there if it&#x27;s cached and cut down on network traffic going out.
 One main concern is being able to freeze the updates/packages so that we can update our test string, verify it works and then update the prod string with the same package versions and everything.
 Obvious workaround is just to take note of package version #s when we do the update to test string but while doable that would be annoying for some of the admins i&#x27;m sure and I want this as simple as possible.
 Is there a way to set apt-cacher-ng to have 2 cache directories?

                              <span>Hello all! I am trying to start a new career in IT and am looking for good courses to help study for the A+ cert exams. I know the exam was changed recently for core 1 &amp; 2 and wanted to see what people had used in the past to help study. I have found many Udemy courses and books, but am not sure what will be the most beneficial. I use computers frequently, but do not have a degree or experience working in IT. Please share what you found to be the best informational pieces to help pass the exam! I am trying to get my foot in the door and am not sure what would be the best course to start with on this journey that continues to align with what is needed for A+. Thanks all!

                              <span>I am no longer satisfied with the hosting I used for MonitUp.com and I want to change it.
 ​
 MonitUp, measures the productivity of employees and freelancers with employee monitoring.
 ​
 They did a firewall update Sunday night and I noticed the problem Monday morning. It took them until Monday noon to resolve this, the website failed to work properly. This is unacceptable. Losing customers for a SaaS product :(
 Which hosting are you using? Who in the world does this job best? Uninterrupted service and fast support in case of a problem are important.
 I don&#x27;t believe in the &quot;best hostings of 2022&quot; articles, the best ones usually depend on how much you pay the company that wrote that article :)
 We live in a world of lies!

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

This is a medium sized logistics/shipping business. They mainly have a small team of sys admins and helpdesk guys with no real networking guys. I&#x27;d be working with one other network guy who is more junior (guy just got his CCNA)
 Small offices and locations peppered around the US. Fortinet, Sonicwall, Meraki, Dell storage, Meraki/Fortinet wireless, with Microsoft Hyper V. Not too terribly complicated from what I can tell.
 They don&#x27;t have any monitoring AFAIK, so I&#x27;ll be helping them build out that infrastructure there.
 Given this context, what are some of your tips/questions to ask to acclimate yourself to a new environment? Any favorite documentation tools? Personal recommendations for log aggregation solutions?

                              <span>Hello. Would love thoughts/opinions on the best devices or type of devices or service. I have recently started at a small but growing enterprise. Company has 4 locations in the US and 3 in Asia. 3 locations have 200-300 users each and the rest are tiny. One of the larger sites hosts a single public facing application, accessed by our partners, nothing else is hosted publicly in the enterprise services (with the exception of client VPN). The rest have users mostly accessing Office 365, other SaaS applications and a smattering of internal applications. So far the long term goals of the company are:
  
To ideally consolidate all sites on a single platform - not a hard requirement if something else makes sense but right now it&#x27;s a hodge podge and current gear is up for renewal and/or end of life. Everything is basic firewalls right now, no NGFW/UTM/SWG etc.
 To implement a greater degree of filtering/inspection/prevention/reporting and to ultimately integrate with an EDR/XDR platform for better visibility.
 To ideally eliminate our MPLS in favor of an SD-WAN, with redundant ISP&#x27;s in each location
 To move all server workloads, including the single public facing app, to public cloud
  
The security vendor who my boss (CIO) has a relationship with is pushing him to buy their EDR/XDR platform along with their UTM&#x27;s in every location. This is running a pretty high price tag and causing him to think about whether he can afford two for every location to have redundancy/fail over. I have a good networking foundation but my background is more on the server and storage side. At this point I am thinking that these UTM&#x27;s at each location may be overkill for users surfing the internet. I am thinking there might be better/more cost effective alternatives. Or whether a hosted solution like zScaler or a competitor would be more cost effective. Ideally whatever solution we choose should have some way to integrate with an XDR platform.
 WWYD?
 thanks

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am a lab equipment technician, and ran into a configuration I was unfamiliar with today and was wondering if some here might be able to help me understand a bit better. My networking knowledge is probably about a 4 out of 10. 
 We have an analyzer that processes patient samples and sends that data to an information management system. Normally its all TCP/IP, which allows me to easily switch the analyzer between communicating with a production server and a test server by switching the IP and PORT (which are both static). However I ran into one today that was configured with an ethernet to RS232 adapter. 
 Basically, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC) &gt; Lantronix Box &gt; Management System. 
 Parallel to that, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC)&gt;Firewall&gt;client network&gt;analyzer diagnostic report exports to a website I can access from home. 
 I was just wondering what the purpose of running a seperate RS232/TCP/IP converter to the management system would be, if the analyzer and management system could be ran all via TCP/IP (which is what I normally see). 
 I tried to keep it concise without being too vague, but if there are more details I should include please let me know. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings. I&#x27;m struggling with creating an IPSEC connection between colocated server running Debian 11 and KVM/QEMU.
 It seems there&#x27;s something &quot;mysterious&quot; about the virbr0 interface. I have a tunnel created using Strongswan IPSEC but it really only works in one direction. It acts like a firewall issue, but I&#x27;ve tried many things that make me believe it&#x27;s more of a fundamental limitation of QEMU/Libvirt/virbr0.
 I&#x27;ve have created several tunnels with Strongswan, but this roadblock has me stumped.
 Has anyone successfully created an IPSEC tunnel with KVM host using strongswan and the default virbr0 network? I&#x27;d like to have my VMs reachable over the IPSEC tunnel and also allow the VMs to reach my local LAN.
 I can reach the VMs without issue, but I can&#x27;t connect from the VM to my local LAN. I noticed the issue when trying to connect two KVM hypervisors over the internet with Strongswan IPSEC. I&#x27;ve been running Strongswan to connect to my VMs in the cloud for over a year, but never realized the tunnel really doesn&#x27;t work in the other direction (other than ping/ICMP works).
 The basic oddity is like this: I can ping a remote LAN host over the tunnel, but if I run traceroute, it tries to go to the public interface first, which leads me to believe it&#x27;s a limitation of virbr0.
 If anyone would like to help, here are my iptables on the kvm host.
 Local LAN &#x3D; 192.168.7.0.24
 Remote virbr0/KVM LAN &#x3D; 192.168.222.0/24
 Here&#x27;s the strongswan config.
 I think the workaround is to create a tunnel using Wireguard, but I hate being defeated and would really like to learn what I&#x27;m doing wrong or not understanding.
 Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute.

                              <span>Yep, the heading is the TL;DR.
 I recently purchased a SonicWall TZ270 for the family business as there was no sort of security infrastructure before. This is replacing what was just a basic home router.
 Ever since the firewall was implemented, there has been intermittent internet connectivity happening roughly 3x an hour lasting from 10 seconds-2 minutes. edit: closer to 5 minutes.
 ​
 Here is the current configuration:
 X0 - LAN 192.168.0.x
 X1 - WAN
 X3 - DEV 192.168.7.x
 X4 - SRV 192.168.5.x
 DHCP and DNS are on a Windows Server on the SRV network with IP Helper on the SonicWall. No issues with either of those.
 Ports are open for 2 services on 2 different servers - configured with wizard.
 ​
 Diagnosing:
 - Confirmed there are no duplicate DHCP or DNS servers
 - Disabled failover probing (known SW issue)
 - Ran packet traces
 - Pinged internal IP&#x27;s, external IP&#x27;s, internal hostnames, external hostnames for info
 - Reset to factory defaults, reconfigured as bare-metal as possible
 ​
 It looks like when the internet connectivity drops, I lose access to the WAN, both hostnames and IP&#x27;s, but not anything on the internal network. I managed to catch the drop on 1 packet trace on the firewall and it dropped nearly 400 packets in a split second, all blaming either multicast not being configured, or something on the wrong subnet (known issue with this ISP).
 ​
 Is there ANYTHING else I can check? Or do I throw this out and just get a Sophos?

                              <span>Hi, I have been racking my brain and researching this issue for about a week now. Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t fit here.
 The issue I&#x27;ve been having, is that from a oracle cloud ampere server (with a 4 Gbps link) located about 1200 km away, with 34 ms of latency, I cannot seem to get more than about 100 Mbps to my local connection. 
 I have tested it using iperf3, and even if I tinker with the settings to adjust threads it will not get any more than 100 Mbps. I have changed the mtu on both machines, changed the max tcp window size, and tried to change the hardware settings for nics on both of the machines. When I run a udp iperf3 test, I can reach the maximum speed my connection allows (1 Gbps).
 The reason why I believe more bandwidth should be possible is that when I use a wireguard vpn, I can reach tcp speeds through that connection to the server, above 600 mbps. Also, a speedtest from the server to a local speedtest server is about 1500 Mbps, and my connection to that same speedtest is at 1000 Mbps.
 I am not sure if this is just bad routing, or bandwidth delay product. Could someone shed some light on this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am experiencing some very odd TLS negotiation behavior between one of our clients and the webserver/LB (different sites).
 This is only affecting one LB for only one subnet in our VDI env (no other client has presented any problems).
 I can see traffic is leaving the VDI firewall and hitting the edge in front of the web server and then leaving, however, the FW outside our VDI env is not seeing any return traffic (I find this odd since Wireshark on the client shows reset packets as well as other ACK being sent from the webserver).
 Now here is where TLS comes in. I am seeing in a Wireshark capture multiple other connections going through the same edge FWs are negotiating at TLS v1.2 and are successful. But only this one is negotiating by default as TLS v1.0 by the client and then getting a reset (since we reject v1.0 and 1.1). I have tried forcing TLS v1.2 at the browser level on the client and it still negotiates at v1.0.
 The only thing I haven&#x27;t tried (since I don&#x27;t have admin access to the VDI machines) is doing the windows OS-level registry change for removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>I have recently taken a position as IT director and my predecessor was painfully parsimonious - to the extent that he was bragging about getting our main production switches - HP 1910&#x27;s from an online seller of refurbished gear for $150 each. Now, one of our several firewalls (no, I don&#x27;t know why there are several, but there are) has failed, and we have consumed the cold spare that was on the shelf, but the device is old enough to no longer be available for sale new. I&#x27;d like to unify our firewall duties into a single unit (or, preferably an HA pair), and wanted to see if anyone here has advise about any of the devices I&#x27;m considering. I have a personal bias toward the Palo&#x27;s, since I spent the last two years piloting a pair of 5220s. Also, my network manager has an interest in Fortinet in particular, since they offer a full stack of gear - FW, switches, and APs. I also am not interested in Cisco, partly because the $250k order I placed at my former place of employment is on month 14 without fulfillment, with no end in sight. 
 Here&#x27;s the list, and thanks for looking:

                              <span>Been googling this for awhile. I know it&#x27;s possible because I&#x27;ve seen it enabled on another Watchguard before but don&#x27;t know how it got set up. Under System &gt; SNMP I can see you can set it for read but I can&#x27;t figure out how to write.

                              <span>We have four Netgear S3300-28X-PoE+ that are stacked functioning as layer 2 switches. I will speak about one switch to make this scenario simpler. VLAN 1 - all ports are untagged. VLAN 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. VLan 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. Upstream router is acting as the DHCP server for each of these VLANs but each VLAN is configured on a different subnet on the upstream router. 
 ​
 My question is how does the upstream router know which subnet to serve DHCP on?

                              <span>So there is this setup
 10.0.10.0/24 - Working
 10.0.20.0/24 - Non working
 When request sent from pgadmin client to pgpool from non-working subnet, it takes about 15seconds for only one single packet to get processed. This happens at start of connection after three-way handshake.
 After that particular packet, subsequent packets are having &lt;1ms RTT.
 From the same non-working setup, if we bypass pgpool, and directly access db, it works well.
 What could possibly causing this issue?
 It is consistently reproducible.
 Have asked this question in r/PostgreSQL but no conclusive help yet.

                              <span>Hi All, We are using multiple windows servers connected directly on firewall which is working in HA (High Availability - Fortinet) . On server side we are using switch independent teaming with dynamic load balancing with specific standby server. Whenever firewall changes from primary to secondary due to one link failure on one of server, primary firewall switches off all its connected ports to change connected servers teaming on standby mode. Now after sometimes primary firewall&#x27;s all port switches on though secondary firewall is running. Now as server&#x27;s active ports are on server teaming switches back to primary and firewall still in passive mode. Is there any way I can retain server NIC teaming to last state irrespective of primary port availability on server 2019.
 Thanks in Advance. Pardon for grammatical or any other mistake as I am new to this community.

                              <span>We are located in a small office, with lots of computers on the same subnet. The layout is pretty simple. We have an old windows 2012 server that acts as a DHCP server. A few switches and access points for wifi devices. On the edge of the network there is a Cisco firepower 1120 outside connected to the ISP and inside is connected to the main switch. We use this for RA VPN and we can reach the internet through this. We have no router, only switches and acces points.
 The problem is when the firewall is down the subnet becomes unresponsive, devices cannot ping eachother, sometimes new devices do net get IP addresses. If the firewall is removed computers should be able to arp and find other devices, and we should still get IP addresses since we have a DHCP server. In the firewall DHCP server is disabled. 
 We had an old ASA firewall and the issue was the same with that one, but I would like to get to the bottom of this problem. The firewall config is almost default, one acl to allow internet access, dhcp disabled, RA VPN enabled. NAT is the default dynamic inside,outside.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea what could be the problem? Does this has anything to do with proxy arp?

I have Reolink POE cameras that I need to have placed in areas where having a Ethernet cable is unsustainable... So I&#x27;m thinking, if I get two WPA3 Wifi extenders (that supports PMF) and connect one into the POE switch and the other to the camera. Will this work? Will it protect me from Deauth attacks?
 Or does anyone have any better solution?

Most of our users with macbooks can use it as well with the integrated osx von client, just one runs into a problem. he tries to connect and gets after a while the message that there was a timeout. Server did not respond.
 The ppp.log says: IPSEC connection started IPSEC phase 1 client started IPSEC connection failed publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!
 The OSX version is macOS Monterey 12.6
 Does anyone have an idea what could be causing this or maybe even a solution/workaround?

                              <span>I am trying to understand how likely a Cyclic Redundancy Check is to fail, given a particular divisor P(x). I am specifically interested if there are an odd number of bit flips in my message, an example to follow.
 Some prerequisite info:
 CRC is a very commonly used way to detect errors in computer networks.
 P(x), G(x), R(x), and T(x) are all polynomials under binary field arithmetic (i.e., all coefficients are mod2: 0 or 1).
 P(x) is the polynomial that we are given and that we will divide by.
 E(x) is an error pattern. It is XORed with T(x) to get T&#x27;(x). G(x) is the message that we want to send.
 R(x) is the remainder of G(x)/P(x) or just G(x)modP(x).
 T(x) is our sent data, (x^k)G(x)+R(x), where k is the degree of P(x).
 T&#x27;(x) is our received data but potentially with errors.
 When T&#x27;…</span>

                              <span>I’m currently getting a fibre link between two sites finished up and we ran into a snag. We were supposed to have dark fibre provided, but the contractor who did the splicing did it wrong. The fibre belongs to a local telco and the alternative they are looking at is to patch it at their CO, but this makes me a bit nervous as it makes the link completely out of my control. 
 To put my mind at ease I’ve been thinking about encrypting the traffic, but it’s not something I’ve done before. The switches are both Cisco 9200L. Is it relatively easy to accomplish and is there any added latency?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone not sure if i am in the right place and i am not sure if anyone went through this or heard of someone going through this but i have been overthinking about this situation for the past weeks. 
 So I have been working for a company as a Help Desk Analyst i went in as a contractor and most recently i have been made full time my manager put me on a slack call with him and he told me the news 
 Before all this happened he knew for a while that i want to be a system administrator it has been my dream job he asked our director who runs the system administration team and he told my manager to tell me that he is not looking for anyone new at the moment 
 after he told me that he went on to say that I will be training you once a week and i told him that is very generous of you because he has a very busy schedule my manager is our service desk manager and he also does system administration
 I just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens to me because my manager went on to tell me that if my director does need a system administrator it won’t be for 2 to 3 years obviously he is just guessing and doesn’t know for sure. 
 I am really appreciative of the fact my manager is gonna trian me and i will get to learn and leverage my skills but i am young i don’t want to be in help desk for another second and i definitely do not want to wait 2 to 3 years to become system administrator 
 I am sorry for the long speech i just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens after? 
 also my manager told me “don’t worry you definitely will not stay in help desk” he tells me i am very ambitious.

                              <span>Hey,
 So Rackspace screwed up bigly and took down e-mail for over a week (ongoing). We&#x27;ve migrated all of our users to Office 365 and are currently using the Admin Center. 
 We want to totally disassociate from Rackspace completely-- but all the Office 365 Suite licenses are held there. We plan on purchasing them directly through O365 admin center--- but my main question is:
 Would we have to uninstall and re-install Office 365, or are we good as it stands?

                              <span>Here is a link to the original.
 So I set up a meeting with my boss and I fumbled through a shitty 2 weeks notice. I told him I’m leaving. I didn’t want to hurt the guys feelings so I told him I need to be remote to be able to support my family more which is true but mainly I was sick of the constant lack of support while being handed project after project while trying to be an entire IT department for a large organization. 
 I kid you not I got the 5 stages of grief from him.
 In no particular order:
 Denial- what do you mean? Your not putting in your 2 weeks notice are you?
 Anger- There is no way I am going to be able to replace you by the deadline! Who gave you an offer? How much?
 Bargaining- Would you stay if gave you 5 grand? Can you please stay until march, I’ll let you work from home! We can work with you. Please let me work with you!
 Depression- I thought we were friends. I can take care of you. Give me a chance please! 
 Acceptance- you’ll want to hand in a formal notice of resignation if this is what you really want. 
 I didn’t want to tell him I accept an offer anywhere else but he kept patronizing me by telling me that money is gonna be tight and shit so i finally told him I got an offer somewhere else that gives me more freedom. He kept fucking grilling me to give him a chance to do good by me but it just felt weird. I told him I’d sleep on it cause I felt bad but I told him not to expect me to change my mind. Now he’s fucking texting me outside of work saying he spoke with the ceo so they can “make it work” for me to work remotely most of the time.
 TLDR; Gave 2 weeks notice and tried to be nice by focusing on a personal priority of mine instead of telling my boss what i really think and it back fired. 
 I’m handing in a formal resignation tomorrow hopefully it’s all just acceptance from there out.

 This is my first post on this subreddit and one of my first post ever, I want to start by giving context to my little BIG issue; you see I started working in this small financial company on the rise a year ago, a lot has changed since my first day as a data entry clerk on quickbooks, and now we have evolved to become a big company, in this process of becoming bigger and bigger I was changed positions to become the IT manager even though I was not hired for such position.
 Between the things I helped do to evolve the company are the following things:
  
Changed back office to improve workflow.
 Started the process to transform our company into a online solution provider for our very wealthy costumers.
 Added an mdm system for our company and made the company soc2 compliant (after…</span>

 Not the worst description I&#x27;ve seen, but still very unhelpful. Not sure why it&#x27;s so hard for users to provide any details. Is this a file from a website? Some internal application? Elsewhere? Are you using a browser? Which one? Are there any error messages? At the very least, can you provide a phone number that I can call to talk to you to get this information?
 I gently responded to the ticket asking for more details (including some prompts to make it easier). Crickets.
 Sorry for the rant.

I&#x27;m using standard 20 outlets rack-mounted PDU&#x27;s but have special power supplies that have 4 outlets one for each modem. The problem I have here is that if I want to reset a modem remotely I need to take down the 4 modems attached to the PDU. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of an enterprise USB-C managed PDU, preferably with 50-100 usb outlets per PDU.

Users had been warned for weeks that this was coming, that the Box app had already been pushed to their computer, and that they needed to sign in to see how it worked so they would understand how everything worked and how to access shared files once the server is down.
 Of course most users ignored this and so, expecting exactly that, I was on site first thing today to get them going.
 Unfortunately things went sideways and most people who hadn&#x27;t already signed in were unable to. The company uses Google Workspace so Box had been added as a SSO app through SAML, but signing in with their Google credentials either produced a prompt to create a password (???) or an error saying &quot;invalid credentials&quot;.
 I immediately created a ticket with tons of detail and SAML traces, got a pretty quick reply from a T1 tech who said that the accounts I referenced didn&#x27;t have passwords and could I please have the users create them. After a bit of back and forth about what &quot;SSO&quot; stands for he escalated the ticket.
 Hours passed. Frantic web searches yielded nothing. I looked through the SAML traces myself and couldn&#x27;t find anything (I know nothing about web dev but figured I&#x27;d try). I called the Box account manager, who also &quot;escalated&quot;. Updated the ticket email with more details. Called the account manager again. Had the customer&#x27;s CFO call the account manager with me on the line.
 5 hours later I got a reply from someone claiming to be a T2 tech, asking for a SAML trace from an affected user.

 Will start pinging you using technical terminology, basically just combining words together that don&#x27;t make any sense. 
 Then he&#x27;s bugging out about VLAN ID&#x27;s - Apparently using VLAN ID&#x27;s as 10/20/30/40/50 makes no sense to him. So instead VLAN ID&#x27;s have to 100 / 300 / 500 / 700 
 Won&#x27;t get on a call to clarify any of the nonsense he&#x27;s asking you to do, won&#x27;t answer you when you have a follow up question and then 30 minutes later will ping you back asking if you finished doing what he asked you to do.

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 I left my previous role (Head of IT (was very hands-on/3rd line)) for an educational establishment in early 2021 as I needed a break and wanted to try something new (self empself-employedloyed retail business).
 ​
 It&#x27;s been almost two years, and I&#x27;m ready to jump back into IT but struggling to land an interview.
 ​
 I do not want to go back into management. I always enjoyed the sysadmin and project side of the role, but I hated the management side. It wasn&#x27;t my choice to get into management but something that happened over several years.
 ​
 Anyway, I&#x27;ve been applying for 2nd line/3rd line support roles as well as project-based infrastructure engineer roles. I haven&#x27;t had one interview request with about 60 applications.
 ​
 I&#x27;m considering spending some downtime to re-train for a specific role since my previous roles were very general sysadmin and network support.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve considered either Cloud or Cyber Sec, but leaning more towards Cloud as I am more familiar with it. Likely Azure as I have had exposure to it. 
 ​
 My questions are:
  
If I pass a couple of Azure certs, am I likely to get a Azure-based role without practical experience working with Azure, considering I have 10 years of network/IT support experience?
 What over avenues can I go down to try to land a job back in IT?
  
​
 Thanks

                              <span>Ubiquiti/Unifi still just seems completely non-ready for the workplace, and I&#x27;ve been using them for years now in spite of it.
 Trying to work on a budget here, so good Meraki gear is out of the question. A year or two ago or so, one of the UniFi &quot;controller&quot; upgrades put a bunch of our older, perfectly-functioning AP&#x27;s out of management scope. They still run but we can&#x27;t change any SSID settings or even see how many clients are connected because the hardware is EOL. I could understand a nag screen or something, but to actually take functionality away from perfectly functional hardware? Come on now.
 So we bite the bullet and pick up some new U6-LR AP&#x27;s. Oh fantastic, now they are pulling 16+ watts each and overpowering the PoE switches, leading to constant reboots of the APs. Cool - it&#x27;s one of the bugs that is fixed in the new UniFi &quot;Network Application&quot;, let&#x27;s upgrade that again.
 Nope! That requires installing Java 11, which seems to be either unobtainable or undetectable, because I&#x27;ve installed at least 3 different versions of JDK, OpenJDK, some weird third-party extraction of JRE 11, and some other garbage, just for the UniFi installer to tell me it still needs Java 11 and quit the installer. Why does the latest Unifi software not use the latest Java? We&#x27;re on version 19 now for God&#x27;s sake.
 So now I can&#x27;t access old hardware, can&#x27;t use new hardware, can&#x27;t upgrade the software, and if I&#x27;m able to install it I&#x27;m sure I will run into some other new stupidity, plus have to hack my way into making it a service again because it&#x27;s only a console application for some ridiculous reason.

                              <span>My company is a late adopter of the cloud, though they want to go to the cloud. For On Prem we use mainly Hyper-V for Windows and RHEV for Linux. I am on the Linux side and trying to create a gold image as we don&#x27;t want to use the Market Place images, due to costs and mnagement. We have about a half dozen subscriptions for Azure and each one has many resource groups. 
 ​
 In tests it looks like the market place image is easy to deploy, though it isn&#x27;t what we want. Looks like custom images are tied directly into the resource group and I think, if I undrestand it correctly, we need to have a gallery to be able to use an image within the other resource groups in the same subscription, though need a seperate gallery for each subscription? It feels like there are a lot of different settings when it comes to creating an image and Azure is very picky, yet very unforgiving about things. Simple things like changing names of the image can&#x27;t be done, you have to create a new image w/ the name you want.
 ​
 Due to inforced RBAC, we can only create and delete VMs, we can&#x27;t create Images, which is an internal problem that we have. So it doesn&#x27;t help that we have a seperate team working on it, though we are trying to have that role added to our group. The other team, which is part of the Windows Team uses Market Place Image for their stuff, so they don&#x27;t have much experience with creating gold images.
 ​
 Also the latency between the cloud and our on prem enviornment seems to introduce a lot of other issues, we have to up timeouts in tools that we have no issue communicating across the country to our sister DC, though communicating between our DC and Azure in the same side of the country has time out issues.

 What are the coverage dates for the three Windows 7 ESU SKUs?
 Windows 7 Extended Security Updates 2020: January 14, 2020 - January 12, 2021
 Windows 7 Extended Security Updates 2021: January 13, 2021 - January 11, 2022
 Windows 7 Extended Security Updates 2022: January 12, 2022 - January 10, 2023

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 A little background info before we start : I am originaly come from a software developper background. After some misshaps in my personal life, i&#x27;ve had difficulties finding a job as a developper. I then decided to apply for helpdesk positions at multiple local companies and landed myself a job at the local university.The job was advertised as a &quot;helpdesk&quot; position.
 I&#x27;ve been working there for the past 1.5 years. The transition with the person before me was a little rocky at first since i had so much to learn in so little time (AD / GPOs / Imaging / Networking ...) and i&#x27;m still learning new stuff everyday.
 I manage around 150-200 Windows 10 machines. The department uses a variety of CAD softwares ( CATIA / Inspire / MoldFlow / MSC Patran_Nastran / Vericut ...) but they mostly use SolidWorks.
 The person before used to create a windows image every year with the latest version of the softwares they use. This created a problem where the images he created were at the very least 75gb. I&#x27;ve been able to move away from this by automating most of the installs with scripts.
 Now that i think i have the basics down, i&#x27;d like to optimize the process and find ways to deal with SolidWorks configs in a multi-user environment.

 I have hosted Nginx on AlmaLinux 9 for while, it has been working fine. Just serving static files nothing else, not running any dynamic web app the CPU barely hit 1% usage. And along with it there is Grafana Agent running.
 But I have notice the system is taking lot of memory as a cache is it normal?
 And how can I check from which process this cache memory is generated.
 Here is the memory usage from free -m command:
  total used free shared buff/cache available Mem: 23979 977 448 223 23094 23002 Swap: 0 0 0 
 Thanks!

                              <span>What do you call an occasional attempt to hack into one of your accounts? It&#x27;s not persistent, but once a day, a service from the same IP tries a couple accounts and then gives up. We are blocking the IP (and noticed it was listed on AbuseIP), but wondered if this really would be described a brute force attack. Seems more like a lazy attempt attack. Can a brute force attack run the gamut from &quot;one account/attempt&quot; a day/week, to persistent attempts with no stopping?

                              <span>Why do employers torture us with 24-grit toilet paper that could be used to refinish hardwood floors? Is it really too much to ask they have nice, fluffy pillow-like TP to pamper our asses, given how much they&#x27;re normally reaming us? I get employers like to discourage employees spending an excessive amount of time in the stall (besides, are we really wasting company time sitting there on the throne if we&#x27;re closing tickets as we sit there?), but crappy TP doesn&#x27;t discourage multiple visits -- it just means we have to bring our own.

                              <span>Hi. 
 So we have a few locations where machines are randomly dying, (dell and hp), the users sometimes see an applocker style message saying an application cannot be run, please contact your system administrator, then if they reboot the machine goes into a state where it never fully boots, no real pattern at all, only oddity is they are all W10 pro boxes, and applocker is present in the domain, but those SKU&#x27;s cannot run applocker (although it is logging that).
 This has only just started happening (1 end of last week, now we are seeing a lot more), anyone else seeing this?

 ​
 ​
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on server 2022. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 i have observed &quot;SSL 64-bit Block Size Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)&quot;
 ​
 ​
 I got this solution from vulnerability team , but don&#x27;t know how to apply fix for the same.
 ​
 ​
 BTW, already disabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1 
 ​
 ​
 List of 64-bit block cipher suites supported by the remote server : Medium Strength Ciphers (&gt; 64-bit and &lt; 112-bit key, or 3DES) Name Code KEX Auth Encryption MAC ---------------------- ---------- --- ---- --------------------- --- DES-CBC3-SHA 0x00, 0x0A RSA RSA 3DES-CBC(168) SHA1 The fields above are : {Tenable ciphername} {Cipher ID code} Kex&#x3D;{key exchange} Auth&#x3D;{authentication} Encrypt&#x3D;{symmetric encryption method} MAC&#x3D;{message authentication code} {export flag}

 Onto the topic:
 An employee used a BitLocker usb drive due to personal reasons for data transport, and upon arrival one of the folders ended up corrupted.
 Is there anything I can do to help recover the data?
 Currently the folder looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/auPfdPv
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>So we moved our Windows update control to our MSP so we have no control over these anymore &amp; I&#x27;m also not sure of the visibility.
 We&#x27;ve noticed every Wednesday they are installed, we&#x27;ll have a random user or 2 that then can&#x27;t get on via DA the next day from home. A few reboots and appears to resolve itself.
 One machine I looked at I ran
 WMIC qfe list full (not sure how accurate this command is)
 On the Wednesday it showed KB5020487 installed on a machine and then the next day DA didn&#x27;t work. A few reboots later it was back working.
 Searching for KB5020487 it doesn&#x27;t exist on Microsoft&#x27;s KB catalog. I&#x27;ve now looked at other machines that haven&#x27;t had DA issues but also seeing KBs being installed on the Wednesday that have no Microsoft link in their &quot;caption&quot; entry and don&#x27;t appear in the catalog. Another one on mine I&#x27;ve found from November KB5020372.
 n-able is the MPS software they use.
 UPDATE before finished typing :
 Looked at a machine that has Windows 11 that&#x27;s not on the domain and it to has entries with a KB installed that has no reference in the catalog KB5017233. This odd entries are appearing in Windows 10 machines as well.
 Odd.

 I am currently overthinking/revising my digital working environment, tackling some of the annoying things I experienced in the past usage. Like probably most Sysadmins and being a tech-savvy person I have more than one device I work with and bringing my IT knowledge/experience to my home network there are even more devices involved.
 I hope getting your inspiration and experiences on a topic on which Google searches lead me nowhere due to plentily used keywords like &quot;sysadmin&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;, &quot;tools&quot;, &quot;application&quot;, &quot;configuration&quot; and so on. Those keywords lead to posts/threads like &quot;Must have tools for sysadmin&quot; and consorts.
 My train of thought which lead to my old setup was, to use portable versions of my needed tools whenever possible.

 In our environment we have end users which might be using any type of means to access an application (mobile, browser, citrix). Then this goes to a SaaS, then to k8s in GCP, then to an in-house developed App which is on-prem, and then to a good old backend (also on-prem). 
 Is it possible at all to keep the session ID as you pass all these steps, so that your modern session-based performance troubleshooting which you get in the microservices world, as you move to your legacy apps (in my case everything after the GCP). 
 I am trying to get at least the right keywords to google to be able to start building an understanding as to what it takes to have e2e APM in a landscape like that, if it&#x27;s at all possible.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ve got a broken Server 2016 (HRESULT &#x3D; 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE on everything, no installed updates found, not able to add/remove roles and features, etc)
 This is a single domain-controller environment and I need to get this lifted over to a new install. (2019/2022)
 Migrating the DC itself is an OK process, but what is the most effective and least troublesome way of transferring folder redirection for 40 users to the new DC?
 I&#x27;ve done this once before by just robocopying eveything (with permissions and so forth) and all and change the path on the GPO, but two years later I still have calls regarding old paths.
 I&#x27;ve read that &quot;copy content&quot; is a dangerous option and I assume copying everything back to local requires everyone to re-log and will cause performance issues?
 Another thing I&#x27;ve read is to use DFS, however I have never touched DFS - is this the best way?
 I&#x27;d like to do it the correct way this time - what would be the best way? How is this done by the book with no future shit happening?
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve seen this Storage Migration Services as well, but that claims that DC&#x27;s are not supported

                              <span>I created a self-signed SSL certificate and it only works on port 80 I then tried to replace it with a lets-encrypt certificate. I deleted all of the certificate files, I have tried to restart docker and the daemon. I have also tried to remove the override file that I tried to put the certificate in. To create the self-signed SSL certificate, I used the following script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexisAhmed/DockerSecurityEssentials/main/Docker-TLS-Authentication/secure-docker-daemon.sh
 For the override.conf file within /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf I used the following configuration: [Service]ExecStart&#x3D;ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/dockerd -D -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --tlsverify --tlscert&#x3D;/home//.docker/server-cert.pem --tlscacert&#x3D;/home//.docker/ca.pem --tlskey&#x3D;/home//.docker/server-key.pem -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376
 I have restarted the docker container but that has also failed to work.
 Furthermore, I have also deleted the ssl certificate so I have no idea where it is pulling the old on from.

                              <span>I work in a wholesaler company with only 40 employees. We still do a lot of IT things though (Develop our own software. Host this software. we also have our own small datacenter) and have around 6 IT employees.
 In my quest to find a good but still affordable ZTNA and a WAF solution i stumbled upon Cloudflare. It instantly became my favorite IT company in existence.
 Their core belief is &quot;security is something that should be accessible to everyone&quot; and they really actually mean it. If you don&#x27;t know them, let me introduce you to some of their services
  
The fastest DNS resolver in the world with high regards on privacy (free)
 DNS for families that protect against malware and/or adult content (free)
 An extremely affordable ZTNA solution (free for &lt;50 users)
 A WAF, SSL/TLS and DDoS Protection (free for standard usecases)
  
Thank you cloudflare, for making security available to everyone, especially for private usage and small companies too.
 I highly recommend cloudflare, and I am absolutely stunned by their portfolio, their generosity and what they do. Great stuff!

                              <span>I work in the IT Department of a company with a couple of hundred remote users, who are a mix of technicians and sales people who use their devices constantly. Occasionally I need to configure a device and have it sent to them, and because they use it all day, they need it to arrive already configured, logged in, applications set up etc etc.
 ​
 We&#x27;re using InTune with AzureAD authentication, a mixture of Windows laptops/tablets and Android phones. We&#x27;re encrypting the devices before sending them out etc.
 ​
 The main issue I&#x27;m having is that before I can configure a device, I need to contact the user and ask for their password. Sometimes the user is unavailable, and I can&#x27;t get hold of them, which delays things, and I also worry that taking a note of their password is a bad practice.
 ​
 I wonder if there is a way that I can configure the devices and sign into the user&#x27;s corporate accounts on the devices without needing their password. If not, then what is the best practice to do this?

                              <span>Hallo,
 is it possible to have openldap working both functions, delivering its own data (e.g. group membership), but proxying password authentication to e.g. Active Directory?
 I&#x27;ve read about openldap proxy (with &quot;backend ldap&quot;) in the Samba Wiki, but I&#x27;m not sure it covers my scenario.

                              <span>This is a long shot, but i hope you have some guidance / experience to throw my way in regards to Terminal Servers and FSLogix.
 We have recently begun seeing multiple users complaining that when they are working on a Terminal Server with a multi monitor setup, that they will periodically and at random get disconnected to one of their monitors, so the sessions stays open and they can keep on working, but only on that single monitor.
 They have to completely restart the Terminal Server or do a complete log out and log in, in order for it to connect to both monitors again.
 Hope this makes just some sence, because i sure a heck could not google it
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi fellow sys admins,
 I&#x27;m trying to deal with a very interesting (to me) case. Someone is proxy-mirroring all content of my website under a different domain name.
  
Original: https://www.saashub.com
 Abuser/Proxy-mirror: https://sukuns.us.to
  
My ideas of resolution:
  
Block them by IP - That doesn&#x27;t work as they are rotating the IP from which the request is coming.
 Block them by User Agent - They are duplicating the user-agent of the person making the request to sukuns.us.to
 Add some JavaScript to redirect to the original domain-name - They are stripping all JS.
 Use absolute URLs everywhere - they are rewriting everything www.saashub.com to their domain name.
  
i.e. I&#x27;m out of ideas. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
 p.s. what is more, Bing is indexing all of SaaSHub&#x27;s content under sukuns.us.to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I&#x27;ve reported a copyright infringement, but I have a feeling that it could take ages to get resolved.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I recently tried to make my own windows image with sysprep, which works fine. Now I have the following question:
 I would like to have the installer ask for a computer name, and then automatically install the isntall.wim with the pc i name entered. 
 I have about 50 pcs that I need to re-install so this would save me a lot of time.
 ​
 I already tried some things on google but only to find out that oobe doesn&#x27;t support this anymore. 
 i am pretty new to this part of windows so any help is appreciated :)

The problem is that after I do the image I want to check if the used space/free space matches the original but Windows automatically adds/removes files from it. Do you have any ideas how can I do the check? Can I &quot;freeze&quot; windows to not write/remove anything from C drive for a moment?

 I tried everything online and the only thing that seemed to work with me is GPS and unfortunately it corrupts the file, I have PowerShell 5!

                              <span>Hi. We have a bunch of new laptops and most of them has Office 2010 installed (yeah, old, but this is a policy, can&#x27;t comply). So, I started to receive a lot of tickets with Office Troubles. In finance department the Excel freezes when opening budget model, yet same file on another user opening fine (same laptop, different users). In most departments the Outlook isn&#x27;t showing mail text and PowerPoint is messing up the linked files. 
 In most cases I solved it with office updates, but some are still persist.
 Any recommendations? We&#x27;re using Office 2010 32-Bit (because of macross support), Domain Network, Win 10

                              <span>I run a vpn server with the interface tun0 on a server. I want to open the SSH port on this server so that the ssh connection is allowed only after VPN authentication.
 Which of the following firewall rules is correct:
  
specifying the tunnel:
 ufw allow in on tun0 from any to any port 22 
 
specifying the VPN IP address:
 ufw allow from 10.8.0.2 to any port 22 
 
 Let’s say the server is at 10.8.0.1, and there is only one client at 10.8.0.2. 
 For the second rule, the interface tun0 is not specified. The IP address 10.8.0.2 is not unique. What if the packet comes from an external private IP 10.8.0.2 to the default interface eth0, not from the 10.8.0.2 in the tunnel ? It seems to me the interface must be specified not the IP, to restrict SSH to VPN.
 For the first rule, I suppose the request from 10.8.0.2 first goes to the VPN gateway, say, 10.8.0.0, and then to 10.8.0.1. So shouldn’t it be “from 10.8.0.0”?
 Another question: For the “to any,” if I specify “to 10.8.0.1,” would that prevent NAT masquerading, thus login rejection?

 I&#x27;d like having this on cisco routers and switches. After running white box networking systems I almost can&#x27;t go back to Cisco because it feels so clunky and limited 
 Not sure I ever want to work in Cisco world again

 Of course it doesn&#x27;t mean their masters is in any technology related field, but still, let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s the case - why are people wasting money in master degrees that will get them nowhere and then try to get into information technology?
 ​
 I&#x27;m sorry for the rant, I&#x27;m dumbfounded and at the same time upset that 60 percent of applicants for a position I thought I had a good shot at, have masters.
 Or are people just applying to jobs they will not get to put something on like unemployment benefits paperwork?

 I feel like I&#x27;m putting my nose to the grindstone and sometimes only take 15 minutes of my 1 hour break allowance and most days I feel like I got nothing done because I only got done with the issues that cropped up on that day and my to do list is just as long as when I first walked in the door.
 While my director hasn&#x27;t explicitly said it yet, I can tell that he feels like I&#x27;m not making enough progress on these projects that he has assigned me. I&#x27;m not sitting here complaining, but rather I don&#x27;t know of any reliable method to determine if it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m doing incorrectly or if too much is being asked of me.

 All I literally did was add new DNS records, then added some bindings to some existing sites. The sites didn&#x27;t change in any way.

                              <span>I was so looking forward to enjoying a lazy Sunday with the Mrs. when I get a text from on of my customers. A SAP HANA server is not accessible and it’s got to be fixed ASAP. This is the start of an all day into the late evening odyssey of trying to find login credentials to one of the few physical servers that no one knows how to access. I then had to drive to the office and then over an hour to the data center, to try and figure out how to get into the old Hitachi Symphony Blade 2000 server. After numerous issues creating a jump box vm to get into the ancient remote console, I was finally able to get into the machine. No big surprise that this server has an uptime of 2768 days. I’ve been with the company for 3 years. The issue is not yet resolved but since I can now get to the console, I’m turning it back over to the customer to figure out so I can go home.

                              <span>Hi Team,
 Calling all HP 3Par all stars - am I barking up the wrong tree here? Can I do this, will it work?
 We&#x27;ve recently decommissioned/replaced three x HP 3Par SAN&#x27;s. 1 x 7200 and 2 x 8200&#x27;s. All are still functional, just out of maintenance.
 I&#x27;m contemplating building a Frankenmonster play unit and/or get out of jail free card should bad things happen.
 My thoughts were to take one of the 8200&#x27;s (being newer) and harvest the others for all the good stuff - SSD&#x27;s, RAM, an external disk shelf from the 7200 etc and build something as big and as good as possible given the bits I&#x27;ve got.
 Can I do this with the 3Par platform? I do it all the time with old servers, what about storage?
 Oh - and this will all be 100% offline too - I&#x27;ve kept the old FC switches and a couple of old ESX hosts to build an unsupported play area.
 Any thoughts/comments/traps greatly appreciated.
 Cheers,

                              <span>So I manage a network for a school. It has around 400 users( students, teachers etc) and has around 200 computers but there not managed by a ad server or any server, there are some print server and smb share but it&#x27;s kinda minimum for that many devices. So I asked if I could set up a ad server for loging in and deploying software. They said there&#x27;s no money for buying a windows server standard license. My thought to overcome this issue is to install ad server on a Linux server. But with that many users and many features like wsus and many other features not present in Linux ad implementation is it a good idea or should I just leave it alone and make milion local users

                              <span>Hi All,
 We were asked to block all RDPs on our network, and while I have most successfully blocked wither via the firwall or GPO, Splashtop seems to be a massive issue for us. We cannot block it through the firewall, and we are talking to the vendors as they are just as confused as we are. HOWEVER, I decided to block splashtop via GPO and it it still gains access to the internal PCs. 
 I have it blocked for users and computers using both the &#x27;don&#x27;t run specified application&#x27; and software restriction policies and the app still gets through. Any idea what the hell is going on? I have never seen this crap before.

                              <span>Hello,
 We have mixed environment such as office 2013 , 2016 or 2019.
 my question: how do you organize GPOs in the environment where different office versions are installed? Let&#x27;s say if I set up a GPO that only affects office 2019 and apply it to the entire Computer OU, will only office 2019 ones be affected by this policy? Or What&#x27;s best practices ?
 ​
 Thank you,

 ​
 Hey folks,
 I am using netsh interface portproxy to port forward on my Windows machine.The problem I&#x27;ve been facing is that whenever I reboot the computer, I need to re-add the rules again.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to find a solution for quite some time now and have not found anything that would solve the problem.
 Any ideas on what might be causing it and how to fix it?
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a short-timer who is part of the first round of layoff coming up in a few months which means job hunting time. I&#x27;m also 42 with only one kid left at home but she has one foot out the door so it&#x27;ll just be my wife and the cat with little expenses so I&#x27;m OK with the pay cut if it&#x27;s low stress and good bennies. I keep looking at the IT landscape and feel like it&#x27;s going to change very fast over the next few years with consolidation (cloud/saas) and competition for jobs is increasing. I don&#x27;t want to deal with that now.
 I see quite a few government job openings around the 100k range (plus wife&#x27;s salary) and keep thinking that&#x27;s good enough for me to coast until retirement and I know a few folks who work there saying it&#x27;s gravy work. Plus there&#x27;s that 20-and-out retirement I keep reading about. But I don&#x27;t want to be doing absolutely anything though cause that would just suck.
 So anyway, folks who work in the government how do you like it?

We are having issues with our current email provider who is blocking emails from domains without a DKIM. This is a big problem because we are missing invoices.

 Am I able to provide some kind of files to you to help me diagnose what’s going on with my system? It never does seems to be using all of its resources, and Task Manager show RAM 100% even though the tasks equate to less than 25% 
 I have tried using RAMMAP, which did free up some ram. Also latency mon was showing some problems too

                              <span>We are a state entity with a lot of people. Recently we&#x27;ve been in a ton of meetings about pending changes. Nothing too clear, the meetings are more or less buzzword bingo. I was on LI this morning and saw someone giving props to an outgoing C level (like a step or two under the governor). I click on his profile and he has a picture of an event where they discussed their plans, which would be revealed later. In the background is a whiteboard with the new org and names of who will be doing what, including some names that are crossed out.

 Among many other things, I am owner, master and commander of my company&#x27;s ERP software. I&#x27;ve got that shit on lockdown. I&#x27;m a certified developer for the software, so all customizations have been done by me since I came on board ~3 years ago. Besides dev level customizations, I&#x27;m also the administrator. Business rules, workflows, permissions and so on.
 I kept getting frantic calls after my work hours from our sales reps that they need me to adjust this customer&#x27;s credit limit (a job for Accounts Receivable during work hours) or they&#x27;re trying to issue some inventory to a client but the system thinks it&#x27;s out of stock, so they need me …</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 For our organization we need to deploying different PAC files to users depending on their association.
 For historical reasons this is supposed to be done in the form
 http://:8001 -&gt; hand out PAC script1
 http://:8002 -&gt; hand out PAC script2, etc
 Now I just want to make sure my solution is viable.
 My idea is to just take a good old Apache, have it listen on all the required ports and set the DirectoryIndex to the matching PAC file.
 Would that work?

 Android smartphone however, I want to get onboard but overall, just frustrating to use...
 Mobile use cons;
 - Text Input mode; sometimes does not register, just continues to collect input but it does not transverse through to the other end.
 - Challenging to call up the in session menu to change input method, swipe from left to right just usually exits the app due to androids native navigation method.
 - Mouse emulation method, I&#x27;ve always defaulted to &quot;drag to move&quot; yet, with this setting enabled, I can no longer pinch to zoom which is another hurdle to overcome.
 Like what are the workarounds to make this an enjoyable experience on a mobile device without a keyboard and mouse?

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with expanding a fiber network, tripling the current number of drops. I’ve never done anything like this before. I’ve pulled plenty of single pair fiber and done some SC tipping manually, but nothing on this scale. We’re moving to all LC connections and I’m planning on using a fiber splicer during the install.
 I’m curious to hear what some common pitfalls are and how I can avoid them, and any other tips or tricks anyone has for a project of this scope.

                              <span>Yes, we are a company with lots of different tech departments, crossed all over Europe. 
 Security is in France, sys admins in Netherlands and consultancy almost everywhere in the world. 
 Sometimes the relations between the teams is somewhat.... Strained to put it midly. 
 Any tips and advice about how to improve relations between the teams?
 I&#x27;m looking to a shout out solution integrated with our Intranet to praise your colleagues, which can be part of our bonus system eventually. 
 But any other tips are welcome. Processes, regular meetings, more top down structure all already in place.

 Openstack sucks. I want something a little more barebones like a cleaner red hat or something that&#x27;s stable. 
 Just bare bones Ubuntu? I want something with a support contract. Is red hat the best?
 I&#x27;m trying to spit ball things so I can think through this problem. Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m new to networking. I was wondering I see my trace route results in the command prompt, how can i calculate the packet’s TTL when it reaches the destination? Does the request timed out count as hops?
 For example, if it the packet starts with a TTL&#x3D;100 and it appears that there is 19 hops in the trace route but two of them are “request timed out”, the TTL will be equal to 19, 17, 18 or 16 (depends if the last row decrease the TTL or no?)

                              <span>Hi, looking for a cost effective firewall, switch &amp; AP stack for mass installs in small business environment. Consider this an environment where the likes of Fortinet, Sonicwall or Palo Alto is cost prohibitive. Have come across vendors that are offering generic devices that can they claim to do the same functions without a lot name recognition. One issue I have run into is the ability assess these devices as they aren&#x27;t put through a lot of certification processes or community voices around them.
 Has anyone been down this path before? what did you look for in a successful implementation. How did your solution scale.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for something to centrally edit/update ACLs, and then push the changes to multiple vendors of switches and routers. Preferably something with a web based interface. Anyone know of anything like that? Possibly an open source project? One that isn&#x27;t tied to a larger SaaS-based solution? Thanks.

                              <span>I want to replace existing Juniper gear with HPE 5900AF switches. As I don&#x27;t have that much experience with HPE/Comware, I need some help.
 What the setup should look like:
 ​
 2x 10GbE Ports coming from the upstream provider, running BGP on their end. That means: BGP to the upstream provider, announcing multiple IPv4 and v6 subnets but only taking a default route.
 Customers will also terminate on the switch with a seperate vlan for each customer (And on a seperate port for each customer.) Inside of that VLAN, there will be one gateway address .1. 
 Is there something like l3Interface in Comware like it exists on JunOS or how do I connect the customer vlans to the upstream provider with the default route? Or do I need a bridge like interface for this?
 Also, are the switches capable of line rate L3 features like ACLs? Or will they suffer and choke with a few ACLs/sFlow on some ports?
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I have 3 routers. All are ASRs Two are the same building. Call those Router A and B. Router A and B are connected to Router C in a different location via BGP and a VRF. The BGP session is constantly going up and down every few seconds. All routers have BFD enabled. On Router A and B, with the show bfd neighbor command you can see the sessions disappearing consistently. On Router C, you can see the session showing as admin down and then coming back up every few seconds. I don&#x27;t see any MTU or BFF misconfiguration. What am I missing?

I&#x27;m wondering if someone can explain how this might have worked. Thanks

Anyway I cant join the server and tried pinging it with CMD but timeout. I tried turning off my firewall but still unable to join and timeouts. And then i pinged from my phone with ICMP and still timeout. But when i pinged with TCP from my phone i got responds. Can anyone help me or tell me where to search for ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing the Fawn lab on HTB and while I tried a basic -sV, it didn&#x27;t show me the version of the ftp server. According to Nmap&#x27;s book -sV&#x27;s default is 7, but it also said that higher versions of -sV aren&#x27;t as useful as lower ones. So I tried scanning at a lower version and it worked. Why is that?

                              <span>Canadian based in South America. Currently on the lookout for new clients, but concerned about my rate.
 I&#x27;m a developer and sysadmin. Lots of VMware, Ansible, Docker, OpenVPN. Have a tiny bit of experience with AWS, CI/CD (Github Actions), Networking &amp; Security knowledge. I love Linux, tolerate Windows. Most of my programming experience has been with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Python but I&#x27;m learning Golang. 
 Disadvantages: No certs, but I&#x27;m considering studying for one of the AWS certs. I have a half finished CS degree, couldn&#x27;t complete for financial reasons. 
 My current role is independent contractor for a couple small Canadian businesses. I&#x27;m definitely undercharging them ($25/hour CAD) but that&#x27;s a damn good rate here in South America. 
 How much should I be charging new clients?

 However, I would still like to be able to have a profile script, and creating one just results in the message &quot;(path)\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loaded because [...] blah blah execution policy&quot; in every new window.
 The best I&#x27;ve come up with so far is to make an aliased script or program (in some non-powershell language) somewhere in %PATH%, which starts powershell with -bypass, and have &quot;set-executionpolicy Restricted -scope process&quot; as the last line in the profile script - clunky, but at least the spirit of the execution policy would be preserved.

                              <span>Hey there,
 So we just had multiple clients bite the dust when it comes to e-mail because of the whole Rackspace Ransomware attack. I was just wondering if anybody had any tips for getting some of my clients&#x27; Office 365 software clients synced and running correctly. So far my process has been this:
 - Remote in through Teamviewer
 - Open Outlook
 - Backup .PST files (some of these folks have multiple mailboxes, so I make separate backups for each, which is a total pain and very tedious and time consuming)
 - Delete Profile from Control Panel &gt; Mail Credentials
 - Run Outlook &amp; Put In Email Address &amp; P/W
 - Import .PST Files
 There has to be a better way. Like, I thought I should just be able to tell the email software that Hey! This is now Office 365! And then it just automatically swaps over or something. Is this really the only way to do this? Thank you for any help/tips. It is greatly appreciated as it looks like I&#x27;m starring down the barrel of a full week of 10 hour+ days if this is how it has to be. Thank you

                              <span>Hi Guys
 Did anyone ever encounter an Issue with SentinelOne slowing down Search on SMB Shares?
 We have this issue on one fileserver which hosts a lot of files (mostly PDF in sub directories, most of the time one pdf file per sub directory). The software we use searches those files via SMB.
 Did anyone ever come across something like this?
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ll start:
  
Accelerate innovation
 End-to-end 
 Best practices
 The developer experience
  
There are valid reasons to use all of these, but 90% of the time... nope. 
 If I get enough response to this, I&#x27;m thinking of turning into a listicle of &quot;N Buzzwords That Developers and Sysadmins Hate.&quot; So let&#x27;s see what we can come up with.

 I&#x27;ve picked up obsidian and giving that a go. Tried onenote but hated the free following canvas, especially for text...
 So what notes do you actually take? I read in a few post people going as far as noting down every google.?.? What do you actually keep in your knowledge bases? How much detail? Can any one point me at any decent examples or templates???
 Tried keeping notes a few times but its never lasted long as it&#x27;s never felt useful... So want to pick up so better habits!!

 ​
 I was thinking of leveraging Terraform as the 1st part of the DR strategy because Terraform will setup and configure all resources. The remaining hurdle is the actual data for databases and storage accounts. 
 Has anyone else built a DR strategy using this approach and would you recommend it? Are there in &quot;gotchas&quot; with this approach? Or what other alternatives are a better option.

                              <span>Hi,
 My organization is trying to establish better security policies and one of our issues is the visitation of consultants. We give them limited access on our network, but one thing I’m curious about is direct IP printing. 
 I feel uneasy about granting those users direct IP printing abilities as I don’t manage their devices. 
 From your experience, what are the risks of direct IP printing from folks outside of your organization?

                              <span>I have several old HDDs that have had company information on them. I plan on throwing the disks away as they are old.
 I have quick formatted them in Windows but I found that I can use Mac Disk Utility secure erase with several passes on the drives.
 I was wondering if there is any need to use a tool like DBAN to wipe them, or is secure erase good enough on the Mac? I have an external HDD reader so that lets me wipe the drives on any of my Mac or Windows systems. Or maybe just a hammer and drill could be used and no software wipe at all, thought on this?

                              <span>The only IT employee quit a day after I was hired, just long enough to provide credentials to everything. I&#x27;ve been taking inventory, and the products we have issued out + new in box (about three dozen units) isn&#x27;t matching up with how many were purchased on their respective websites.
 1) The highest tier warranty was purchased. 2) Computrace was not purchased or used on any device. 3) All devices have vPro. 4) We don&#x27;t use a volume license; everything is OEM image that&#x27;s been removed of some preinstalled programs, then GPO when joined to the domain. 5) How would I check to see if any Out Of Band management was used?
 I&#x27;m not looking to get anyone in trouble. Just want to cover my ass. Even something like a &quot;last powered on&quot; date would be helpful. It&#x27;s also possible that these are still in service somewhere, maybe even off the domain and/or without network connectivity. 
 Thanks for any help.
 EDIT: I have used almost every method mentioned here thus far, to no avail. I&#x27;m specifically looking for tools that Lenovo or Dell may have. To be bluntly clear, I am trying to locate about 9 devices that were purchased, with an order and serial number associated to the devices, but are nowhere to be found. Only 2 of 9 of these devices were once domain-joined computers. So, I&#x27;m suspecting 7 of these devices have possibly been stolen, and I need some way to cover my ass. It&#x27;s a smallish company and HR hates me as it is.

I&#x27;m not seeing where to configure FSLogix to use VHDX and the documentation I&#x27;ve read doesn&#x27;t seem to mention it either, it only references VHD(X) everywhere.
 Am I missing something?

 Would love to hear what others are using.

 We have not been able to progress as a company due to this and we have no other choice but to seek advice on what to do and how this issue could be resolved. Any help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>We have a legacy system that only support TLSv1 with RC4 cipher, our browser have already retired this protocol and refuse to connect to it.
 Should we create a proxy for it, ie: browser https request -&gt; proxy -&gt; server TLSv1 ?
 If so, I don&#x27;t know where to start or how to create that proxy is there any good guide or reference?

                              <span>This is probably a dumb question, but I am really confused by ZTNA. I know ZTNA stands for Zero Trust Network Architecture, but I was under the impression that it was a philosophy/goal not an actual software or product. 
 With that said, I am really confused as to what these ZTNA softwares actually do? How is Sophos ZTNA or FortiClient ZTNA any different from a normal VPN? How is ZTNA firewall any different from a normal one?
 I have been wondering this for a while because I keep seeing software companies coming out with there own ZTNA specific products, yet I don’t understand the difference.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that with many of the Cisco configurations you have the option to choose between setting a physical interface or an IP address when configuring certain functionality. 
 For example, when creating a GRE tunnel you can set the tunnel source as the interface number or you can use an IP address. 
 What are the pros and cons of each?

                              <span>Do live streaming services like Twitch, YouTube (when live), etc. use IP multicasting on at least part of the path from the server to the viewers?
 Or is there an individual connection for each viewer, that carries the same data?
 It would seem very inefficient, because the same data would be transferred many times over some internet backbones, to go to all the viewers in some area.

                              <span>Hey Team,
 How do you guys describe your role as a network engineer to non-technical folks?
 I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of just saying I work in &quot;IT&quot; to describe what I do for a living to everyone. But this past week, I was recently hired on as a Sr. Network Engineer for this new company and attended a group onboard meeting. It was just me, a new exec, and the HR person.
 We were asked to describe our roles, and I said &quot;IT&quot; work. Without missing a beat, the exec took out his phone, immediately handed it to me, and asked me to tshoot why it was so slow.
 I half-jokingly said that they&#x27;ll need a ticket before I can do any type of work and expanded that I will be leading the team on the transition, design, and implementation of new acquisition networks, implementing security policies, and datacenter/cloud work. Connectivity. HR lady jumps in and says I fix the WiFi and VPN.
 Later that day, I was out celebrating with friends and met someone new who asked me what I do for a living. I jokingly responded network engineer, I fix WiFi and VPN. My partner got upset and asked why I degrade myself...
 Interested in hearing what you guys say when this question pops up.

                              <span>I built a system that looks for vulnerabilities according to CISA standards without an agent... basically to give a list of discovery ability and patching requirements around NVD. I have it setup now that it works with Captive portal and network joins that you can get device information and vulnerability information on network join. Works really cool for IoT type devices that can join WPA3 or 802.1x networks. 
 However, I want to add another feature that I think would be cool. Which is detecting the network layer ones using SNMP messages. So I wanted to know if anyone had a cool place to get a bunch of dumps of SNMP traffic or the raw models that the vendors use.

                              <span>I would like to measure latency and jitter for my DUT. There are two pairs of ports on my testing equipment. Can I put traffic load on all ports (snake test) except for two ports, and then check latency and jitter of the left pair of ports on DUT by another pair of testing ports?
 To measure latency and jitter for all ports, repeat this procedure for each pair of DUT&#x27;s port.
 Do you think this test is OK for a telecom customer to see?

                              <span>Anybody has some good material for understanding serial comms? I have my CCNA which is pretty much all Ethernet and wireless. I&#x27;d like to gain an in depth understanding of serial concepts too. Any advice is appreciated!

                              <span>I am developing an educational software.
 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

 Same page loads fine if I use an older version of Edge on a server 2012r2 device running edge 108.0.1462.46 (Official build) (64-bit)
 The pages used to load fine on the 2019 server and all the servers in same subnet.
 Trying in IE mode does not improve the situation, nor does using an inPrivate window
 Any ideas what else I can try?
 ​
 EDIT: Servers are all VMs, when i try from a 2019 host it works fine.
 EDIT 2: If I use a portable edition of Firefox on the Print server VM, it also works fine.

                              <span>Had a fun 48 hours. Noticed one of my scheduled backups failed and took a look at our NAS (backups for offline storage) and one of the drives was down on our raid 6. Also noticed a fan was down in the logs in the idrac. 
 Okay, put in a service ticket as it&#x27;s under warranty. Go home and think nothing of it. 
 2nd shift tech shoots me a message in the middle of the night that he noticed something revving up in our DC but couldn&#x27;t pinpoint it - then goes home. While everyone is sleeping the idrac shuts the NAS down on it&#x27;s own overnight. I come in next day, can&#x27;t remote into it so I find out it is offline, then plug in a crash cart. All the volumes showing as foreign and the config is gone.
 OK - little worried. Check the idrac and see all the volumes disconnected from the raid controller. Bump up the escalation on the service ticket and engineer comes out within a few hours. 
 We replace 1x drive, 2x fans. Bright orange dell fans were now black and a little melty. Forced to acknowledge all the volumes as foreign and reload the config. Thankfully everything boots as it should and that knot in my stomach releases a bit.
 Apparently if you lose 2 of 5 fans, the unit shuts itself down to protect from heat damage. The more you knowwww!
 Not sure why the config was wiped other than perhaps the shutdown was not the most graceful.

                              <span>Yesterday I asked a question about changing local GPOs via powershell, I got some responses but none of them worked. I found my solution and it was from surprise surprise Microsoft. LGPO is a command line program that lets you dump the current LOCAL not domain GPO to a text file then convert it back to a policy and import it. Working with it via powershell is a bit clunky, you need to do use Start-Process with CMD as admin to do anything but it works! Just thought I’d give an update.

Does this ring a bell for anyone? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 This maybe a little off topic, so feel free to say i should post it elsewhere.
 I am trying to help out a charity with their mess of a computer system, they currently access their emails via Gmail Workspace and some of these mailbox’s are large at over 15GB.
 They have got Microsoft Business 365 Premium for free as they are a nonprofit and they want to move everything over to Microsoft.
 This is not something I have done before and I&#x27;m hoping will be something useful for me to learn more about.
 So I believe from the Microsoft Admin Centre I can migrate the emails across from Gmail into Microsoft and then the DNS servers will just need to be changed from the current Gmail ones to the Microsoft DNS servers? 
 Then set up the desktop Outlook app to connect to the new Exchange server 
 I found this guide for the migration here - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrating-imap-mailboxes/migrate-g-suite-mailboxes but I am a little concerned about relying on Google and MS to talk to each other properly and do the import correctly. My original idea was to just drag all the emails from their Google Workspace into a local pst file on Outlook desktop app then after changing over to M365 to copy them back across. More labour intensive but safer?
 Also if I do the migration for a 15GB mailbox I expect that to take several hours and theres a good chance emails will be received during that time so what happens to them?
 Have I missed anything out?
 One thing that does concern me is that at the top of that page it says &quot;Effective from December 2022, the classic Exchange Admin Center will be deprecated for worldwide customers. Microsoft recommends using the new Exchange Admin Center, if not already doing so. &quot;
 The further down in step 5 it says &quot;IMAP migration is not available for new EAC. &quot; 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;m working on some FileShare permissions as a cleanup project; by default, our permissions are applied to a top-level file share folder. Different permissions may be applied to a subfolder no more than one level below the top-level file share. 
 We are actively trying to enforce that any other folder permissions needed which don’t fit this model should use a separate subfolder under the top-level file share folder (i.e., \Server1\Accounting\CustomFolder ). 
 I&#x27;m trying to tackle this with PowerShell and the NTFSSecurity module if we have a &quot;Read Only Group&quot; and a &quot;Read Write AD group&quot; applied in the ACLs. I want to get the AD RO or RW group members and see if they are in any folders deep than that to clean it up. 
 Example: Share1/Dept/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3 If Joe Doe is already in an AD group at the Dept folder and then some admin added him directly to Folder3, I&#x27;ll like to have a report showing that.
 I&#x27;ve been doing PS for around six months now, I can do one-liners pretty well, but I need help to write scripts. I would appreciate any guidance you can give me, and if I asked a stupid question or worded it poorly, please let me know! Some of the scripts I&#x27;ve been using are: 
 $notInherited &#x3D; Get-ChildItem -Path &quot;\\Server1\DeptFolder&quot; -Directory -Recurse | Get-NTFSAccess | Where-Object {!($_.IsInherited)} $notInherited | Export-Excel C:\Temp\Spreadsheets\Data_NotInherited.xlsx -TableName Permissions -AutoSize

                              <span>Any solutions for hybrid ad computers to report to non line of site without always up vpn? Our user base just doesn’t have a large vpn adoption rate due to the saas profile we have. We are still in a state of hybrid ad so this is becoming a issue when people return to office and try to connect to wifi via radius and then deal with local password cache issues.

 Or ask the user for a business justification and tell them it was the result of approvers cleaning up permissions and that it may have been and accident?
 These tickets are usually the result of terminations or compliance stuff and while we have been getting a bunch of tickets to remove people - I haven&#x27;t gotten any for this specific repository the user is trying to access - didn&#x27;t expect a ticket like this lol. Team lead didn&#x27;t answer me yesterday when I asked him so thought I&#x27;d ask here

I am sure the gamut of what he has to deal with have all been ranted about before: antique hardware, lack of space and network bandwidth, the only guy who has knowledge of these systems, and terrible and cheap management. Frankly, if it weren&#x27;t a possible violation of contract, I&#x27;d tell him to quit. 
 He knows it, too. Today, he lost some VMs because he overprovisioned the SAN that these were using as a datastore. He&#x27;s got 4 TB of SCSI SAN storage in RAID 5 on a Nexus LUN that is 17 years old, and is running over 50 machines on them. There are barely any backups, he has to pick and choose based on order of importance. His tape backup system failed two years ago, and h…</span>

 I have seen today that there is a critical update 7.0.3i which resolves these issues.I count 15 different PSOD or host unresponsive issues in 7.0.3g, fixed in 3i released yesterday.
 More details at the below link, update in the usual manner via the Lifecycle manager.

 300 users\Pcs with no centralised user management (AD or equivalent).
 All devices were bought from consumer bricks and Mortor stores (Windows Home), endless dlink 8 port daisy chained switches in each room (one port per room) throughout the building.
 Wifi APs, from multiple, Vendors - all configured independently.
 Coding Team storing critical data to a 10 year old NAS (RAID 0) that wasn&#x27;t backed up.
 Office Home licences - 1 licence applied to 5 Pcs - so 60 Office home licences bought on Company credit card.
 Anti Virus was whatever was available for free.
 The poor, over worked, Firewall had a desk fan permanently on beside it to keep it from overheating.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a couple interview for Network admin or Sysadmin but most of them just go over basic level security or just ask about your other roles and do scenarios like &quot;if meet with this how would you approach it?&quot;
 It kills me because I&#x27;ll spend time reading up on technical info just to refresh my mind and then I get with a question like &quot;what leadership style are you?&quot; or &quot;how do you deal with a disagreement&quot; granted they are good questions but they never good past that or just cover the basics. 
 I&#x27;ve thought about if maybe they&#x27;ve determined based off of my initial answers (which are pretty good and I go into good detail) they think it&#x27;s not even worth asking the rest?
 Anyone go through this as well?

Are there any good parts of the job? I’m wondering because I am on the path of cyber security and was trying to figure out if I wanted to go system administrator or network administrator . I personally prefer software and systems over networks, but not if it’s as bad as everyone says.

                              <span>Hi guys I just got a new job and they wanted me to purchase a Windows server 2019 machine to be used as a file server running alongside of their current server which is a Windows server 2003 machine which is controlling their DNS and domain/domain controller and a few shared drives. I was able to install and set up the machine and share the drives that they wanted to be shared but I&#x27;m unable to allow users to enter their credentials to connect. Currently the only way it works for me is if it&#x27;s passwordless, otherwise anytime anyone tries to connect it says that they&#x27;re not authorized to do so. I figured I could solve this by adding the server 2019 machine to their domain but so far I haven&#x27;t had any luck. I keep getting an error saying it found the DNS but can&#x27;t connect. Can anyone help me out please? I&#x27;ll edit this with the exact errors soon I&#x27;m heading in to the office now

 I remember seeing some posts on here a while back about using script servers for running powershell scripts, but I&#x27;m struggling to find it. 
 Does anyone know where the link is and/or have good suggestions for server software (for running powershell scripts)? We typically use scheduled tasks, but I think pitching the idea of a script server would be good.
 Many thanks!

 Front wall &#x3D; TV screen, windows PC, standard webcam
 Right Wall &#x3D; nothing
 Back wall &#x3D; glass and door to leave
 The webcam on the TV can&#x27;t be turned to see the white board because of the sharp angle. It seems the only solution is to get a camera on the right wall (something with double sided tape or some way to stay near the ceiling and out of sight.
 I tried putting a small tripod with an OSBOT on the center table, but they weren&#x27;t happy with how it looked.

 Any suggestions of a camera I could somehow attach to the wall on the right side? The room is probably 15 feet x 15 feet. The cables will be tricky to pass all the way up there, but something that can have a good angle, possibly a zoom if the whiteboard isn&#x27;t visible enough.
 We use the free version of discord and other meeting software, they only show 720p so I don&#x27;t need a fancy 4k solution.
 Thanks for any advice if you guys have gone through this setup.

 Currently for each customer(company with many employees) we provide a full VM environment, and this data is stored on the same VM as the application it self. 
 We are migrating towards a more scalable solution so we need to divide compute and data, meaning there will be separate compute ( app ) instances and separate data storage instances.

 We have Proofpoint as our primary spam filter with Exchange online. Lately, more and more phishing and spam emails have been getting through Proofpoint and every time we get a &quot;Phish delivered due to an ETR override&quot; alert from Microsoft. This seems to be an alert policy only.
 I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to not only alert us with this ETR email, but automatically move any mail that hits that notification policy to the users Junk box? Right now, it notifies us and sends it to the users inbox.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I am developing an educational software.
 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a python script that I&#x27;m running on a single node at the minute. I&#x27;m looking to hire a server farm to process data using the script to speed the process up as the data is taking over 1 week to run on a single node. 
 Looking for something that I can easily get started with. 
 I could use autoscaling in AWS with user data or lambda but it&#x27;s too expensive.
 I had a search but found it very difficult to get much other than farming simulator for &#x27;Server farm hire&#x27;.

                              <span>This post is directly copied from r/ITManagers (albeit with some added bits). I was advised to post this on this subreddit
 So our DHCP pool is full pretty often. A lot of users are using laptops. When they connect their laptop to a cable, their WiFi is still connected. Because of this, a lot of users are using two IP addresses while only one is needed.
 I found some solutions. A Powershell script and a GPO policy that makes it so that an established LAN connection will disable the WiFi connection. However, I don&#x27;t think this cancels the IP Lease that the WiFi connection has. Is there a way to make the WiFi disable AND the leased WiFi IP to be released again?
 The GPO solution would be the best, as we wouldn&#x27;t have to do this on every pc individually. I found the following policy: Computer Configuration -&gt; Policies -&gt;Administrative Templates -&gt; Network -&gt;Windows Connection Manager &gt; Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows&quot;. I am not sure if this also releases the IP-lease of the WiFi connection from the DHCP pool. If not, this wouldn&#x27;t work as a solution as well.
 I like to add that I am just a helpdesk support Employee. I am guessing a lot of people will say that we shouldn&#x27;t have LAN and DHCP in the same IP Range. Though you are probably right, I am Sadly not in a position to change this.
 Thanks in advance.

Any pro tips on what to look for or any better tools?

                              <span>Hi,
 On an Intel NUC used as a terminal to use RDS a user has a lot of déconnections.
 I ping - t and noticed that TTL alternates between 60 for a while then 251 for a while, again and again. When TTL is 251 connection is lost but ping still responds.
 I made a tracert, worked in 5 hops. I ping -t the five hops (the fifth is the destination) and the first is at TTL 255, the second 254, etc. So the destination is 251 and it makes sense but it always alternates between 251 and 60. In both case, the hop before maintains TTL 252.
 How do I intepretate that? (I&#x27;m a young tech sry if the answer is easy)

                              <span>2+ years ago I was a sysadmin for two schools, a primary and a secondary school. 
 I was paid about 65K and was not full time and I did this for about 6 years. I loved working with other people in the school every day and just being in the place daily. 
 Towards the end of my time there, I started asking for better pay and benefits like full time and a permanent role.
 Promises were made and not kept for months and months. Simultaneously, another job had cropped up in the region for sysadmin work in a team environment for several schools wherein you were given a company car and would drive around to support them. It is a subscription model.
 I was one of the first people on this brand new support team in my city. I applied and won and was paid 75K, full time.

                              <span>Hi to everyone,
 Next year I will quit my work as system and network administrator and I plan to travel the world for a year. 
 Does someone know where to find &quot;remote/freelance&quot; job offers or has already experience with this situation. 
 I am still undecided how and whether I want to work at all. On one side I would be happy to have an income to cover my expenses a little. On the other side I dont know if it would limit me too much in my plans.
 I cannot be sure to be always available (internet connection in rural areas all over the world?) and the time differences would also cause problem. Of course, I also want to do and see as much as possible during my trip. To work would also mean a daily loss of time. 
 It is not about the money. I don&#x27;t necessarily have to work to be able to afford the trip. However, it would be helpful.
 I could imagine working a few hours a day as 1st Level remote support. But I&#x27;m not even sure if I should. 
 Do you think it makes sense to look for a job in IT at all, or are other fields of work better suited. For example, as a sales agent. However, I have no experience in this or other sectors. 
 Background:
 Working in IT for more then 10 years. More or less fluent in 3 languages. 
 3 years first and second level support with basic tasks. (mostly onsite computer repairs, helping on user requests with office etc, some network and server administration)
 Afterwards in a small industrial company where my colleagues and I have been responsable for &quot;everything computer related&quot;. From Backup, Network, Mailing, Virtualization, Software, Hardware, Printers, Mobile Devices, Security and so on. 
 I would say I have deep knowledge of most areas a normal company uses, so I would not need to much training in something &quot;easy&quot;. 
 ​
 But as I already said I am unsure if this would even fit me. 
 Let me hear what you guys think about my thoughts.

                              <span>Apparently, creating a user in Active Directory is the &quot;wrong way&quot; to do it, and it should be done using Dashboard (a.k.a. WSE). Are the two not just different methods by which new users can be created? Admittedly, Dashboard gives you different options through the process, but is it definitively the right way and AD should never be utilised? My &#x27;educator&#x27; tells me Dashboard is Microsoft&#x27;s preferred method and should therefore only ever be used, but I disagree using AD is &quot;wrong&quot;, per se.

                              <span>Hey all
 We&#x27;ve been targeted by some weirdo for the past 4 days, sending emails to some of our users rambling about nonsense. Problem is he creates new gmail or yahoo addresses every single day to send new stuff. There&#x27;s nothing really dangerous, no malware or anything else.
 He uses his real name + a series of random numbers + yahoo.com or google.com domain
 At first I blacklisted his first address, and the next day when the second email arrived I made a new mail flow rule to block his name (only part of the addres which has not changed
 The rule is enabled, Enforced, applies if the sender&#x27;s address contains &quot;hisname&quot; and deletes the mail without notifying anyone. 
 I already had a rule like this for specific commercial addresses which managed to bypass our spam filtering and as far as I can tell those work just fine. 
 Other rules set to look for specific strings seem to work too, stuff like subject contains &quot;BTC wallet&quot; and so on, but not this one for some reason. Any ideas ?

I wanted to know if I added a large SSD to the backup server which can be used as the staging folder would help this. I&#x27;m confident the network speed is sufficient but rather hindered by the mechanical disk speed.

                              <span>Hello!
 A third party is going to upgrade a software and they have asked me to upgrade two instances from SQL Server 2012 -&gt; 2019.
 I am not very experienced with MS SQL.
 From what I have seen there are two options:
  
Use the in-house upgrade in the setup.exe for SQL 2019
 Disable the SQL-service, management studio -&gt; backup, install the new instances on 2019 and restore the backups
  
I do however have a couple of questions:
 Is even 1. worth trying? It&#x27;s very small databases.
 I assume I cannot recreate them with the same names, I have to delete the 2012 before creating the 2019&#x27;s which leaves me without anything to fall back to?
 Is there anything else I have to keep in mind?
 What is the go-to way to do this as painless and efficient as possible?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I honest rarely post online, but I would love to hear your thoughts about this as I&#x27;m honestly a bit confused and don&#x27;t know what to do.
 I&#x27;m currently transitioning to a new company (corporate), the company has been around for nearly 20 years now. The salary is good, and you know the usual 9-5 job, I decided to give my notice to my current employer to join this company.
 Mid my notice period, a startup company that is funded and supported has offered me a position, the salary is the same as the one I received from company I&#x27;m moving into, although the base salary itself is higher by around $500/month, since they don&#x27;t have the same benefits as that company, they decided to pump my base salary in order to match the offer that I received from the big company.
 Overall, both companies offered me the same salary, although the big company got more now such as bonuses, among other benefits.
 The startup does not have any benefits beside the monthly salary as they are pretty new right now, I asked them about bonuses, and they said its planned but not yet confirmed as they&#x27;ve just started. They also do not provide equity, and they could not provide me with an answer if they plan on giving equity or not.
 I&#x27;m honestly pretty confused right now on what to pick, I was gonna pick the startup as I bet it would be more relaxed (in terms of environment not work), but if i&#x27;m taking a high risk, what&#x27;s the high reward exactly if there is no equity provided ?
 Sorry for my bad English, please let me know your thoughts about this :(

                              <span>I have read some of the beta release notes of this Edge 109. The following is written there:
  
In Microsoft Edge version 110, the certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be decoupled from the host operating system’s root store. Instead, the default certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be provided by and shipped with the browser.
  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-cert-verification
 There is a policy to still use the system store, but it is removed within the version 111.
 I don&#x27;t like it, but I might be wrong. Just wanted to let you know - in case you didn&#x27;t hear it.
 ​
 Edit: Maybe I misunderstood the information. It is also written:
  
In addition to trusting the built-in roots that ship with Microsoft Edge, the browser will also query the underlying platform for—and trust—locally installed roots that users and/or enterprises installed.
  
I missed that out. Sorry for the inconveniences.

                              <span>So a little backstory...
 Primary DNS server kicked the bucket a couple of months back (that was a fun day). I then changed the DHCP server to point clients to use the secondary DNS server as the primary, and use the Sophos UTM as the secondary DNS server. 
 Jump to last week... Sophos UTM gets pulled and replaced with a Fortigate 80F (I am in love). 
 Jump to this week... I am slowly adding Security Profiles to the Fortigate and making sure that Directors can access YouTube Music and the lowly staff are left with only Spotify. Yesterday it all went to shit (always happens when its a WFH day) and I have users bitching that Teams images are not loading, that attachments in Outlook Web are not loading, and that websites need to be refreshed just to get them to load (That last one got told to me this morning... and thats when I threw my fists up in the air and screamed &quot;F U DNS!!!&quot;
 Changed the DHCP settings, threw ipconfig /release and /renew at a couple of clients to test and you bet your android bottom it worked! 
 I am going to now abuse my internet freedom and watch YouTube videos while I cry into my coffee. 
 By the way... if you have not tried Fortigate then you really should!

                              <span>How are you guys managing permissions/accounts on Windows servers in a DMZ segment?
 Right now, every server in my DMZ is treated as a stand alone (non-domain) server. No LDAP/domain authentication through the firewall. Responsible parties get local accounts on each server they use. As we place more services (&amp; servers) in the DMZ we are starting to struggle to manage them in terms of permissions, accounts, &amp; lack of group policy.
 We&#x27;re considering setting up a DMZ domain. Allowing trusts with our internal domains (or not). Or even allowing LDAP &amp; needed things through the firewall &amp; adding them to our internal domain (but this doesn&#x27;t sound smart).
 What are the common ways you guys are tackling this?

                              <span>if media is overwritable (retention period expired), do you remove that media from library and insert new one? For example library takes 40 tapes and I have 160 available (60 tapes are reserved for offsite backup). If one of 40 is full and after retention, I&#x27;d pull it out and insert new one from 160/100 pool.
 
how many overwrites do you allow before you perform full erase?
 
I am seeing soft write/read errors in my backup software. It&#x27;s not too much (from 5 to 20). Tbh I didn&#x27;t notice it in previous HW setup (old library was HP, new one is IBM, backup SW is the same only higher version). I am trying to keep firmware and drivers in latest versions. All 200 LTO7 tapes were full erased before first usage in backup SW.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I have recently been tasked with improving the file storage at work and I am not sure how. We are a small business with &lt;10 employees and deal primarily with cad files, excel files, and just pdfs. Currently, we store everything on hard drives( yes, very old fashioned) and this is not working out. Overall, we have around 1tb of data, with the largest files being around 1gb. I would like to be able to store this information in one central place, yet grant different people access to certain folders. Sharing and collaborating on documents isn’t a huge focus, yet would be nice to have. We mostly just need a good storage solution that we can access from any computer. A lot of the things we work with are proprietary so security is important to us. What do you all recommend? I’ve looked into one drive for business And share point, azure files, NAS…

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m looking to learn more about colocation and networking in the data center environment. Essentially, I have a few servers that I want to put into a rack in a data center but I&#x27;m tossed up on what direction I should start with.
 The first topic is the choice of networking equipment. The data center provides a 1 Gbps SFP connection. Now, I could plug that directly into a switch and have a server in the rack that handles DHCP, but are there any good cheap switches that have a DHCP server built in that also allows for easy remote management? 
 The first setup I was looking at using was a Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE and a Ubiquti Pro switch. I would plug the SFP from the data center into the Dream Machine, then another SFP from the Dream Machine into the Pro Switch. Ubiquiti was a choice due to the familiarity of knowing how to manage the settings on both devices.
 The second setup was looking into Cisco Meraki devices, however, I&#x27;m not familiar with Cisco&#x27;s product lineup. I do have my CompTIA A+ and Network+, so I am somewhat familiar with using the CLI, but the program I was in only had us focus on managing Cisco devices on a LAN through the CLI only. I was scrolling through threads on WHT and several times Cisco Meraki devices came up. Does anyone know if Cisco Meraki devices have a built in DHCP server? If not, then I would still need to have a DHCP server setup in the rack.
 Also, does anyone have any recommendations on material that I can use to help better understand networking concepts and practices in the data center regarding how to setup and manage BGP, how to assign IPv4 subnets to specific devices, or personal advice with first time colocation experiences?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have patch ports that are connected to something... but I don&#x27;t know what.
 If I plug my laptop into a port... what is the easiest way to determine what switch it is connected to?
 Or the opposite direction... if I know the IP and hardware address for a device, how can I find out where it is connected? 
 I basically want to be able to do the equivalent of traceroute but with device connections. I really don&#x27;t want to follow cables... it would be faster to unplug and see when the connection breaks.

                              <span>Question for you all out there. I&#x27;ve seen many companies do their hostname and domain name formatting in different ways. In the context of an ISP, there are several ways one can identify various useful elements within an FQDN. For example, I&#x27;ve seen companies name router hostnames like:
 ar1.site1.area1
 And:
 ar1-site1-area1
 And various forms with various identifying language within them. 
 I&#x27;ve seen domain portions of the FQDN done several ways too, like:
 {{hostname}}.{{network_type}}.{{state/province}}.example.com
 {{hostname}}.{{airportcode}}.{{countrycode}}.example.com
 Etc.
 My question here is: in the context of a (W)ISP with various services (internet, TV, phone), what do you guys suggest regarding naming standards when it comes to hyphens and dots, particularly in the hostname portion? Do you prefer over over the other? Why?
 What&#x27;s a naming scheme that really stuck out to you in your environment(s) as being very useful and easily let&#x27;s you identify devices just by their names? 
 Thanks in advance. :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of working through a 10G fiber installation (upgrading from 1G copper) and I&#x27;m the person who ran all the fiber in my data center. I&#x27;m not a networking person, more of a SysAdmin, so I admittedly don&#x27;t know a ton about networking equipment.
 During the cutover, one of the corporate IT network guys said there were a bunch of CRC errors on one piece of network equipment or another, and that this was causing really bad slowness. We were then instructed to replace any fiber cables shorter than 2 meters with longer ones. We had a number of 1M cables in place. Apparently (I didn&#x27;t see for myself) the errors went away after this was done. I understand that the IEEE standard says 2M minimum for SR fiber, but I thought that was mainly due to Tx levels potentially being higher than the Rx threshold and damaging the equipment.
 How does it cause CRC errors as well?

                              <span>I have worked for few organizations at the engineering level now and each company is very different in how they manage things. Some NOC&#x27;s just open circuit tickets and forward issues to the correct team, some NOC&#x27;s do everything, some NOC&#x27;s do some break fix but work on escalations. 
 ​
 So I am trying to get a better gauge on what I should actually expect from my NOC? Should I expect them to fully own and run all maintenance and break fix with no help? When is an escalation a good escalation?

I’m somewhat new to automation but I’ve managed to code a handful of scripts for device management, specifically cisco devices using the netmiko library. There are no passwords stored in my current scripts with the use of getpass() and I generally have my scripts strip IP addresses from a text file that I’ll either type out prior to running the script or decrypt a text file when executing the script. Username is manually prompted and entered.
 I realize this is far from ideal but has worked for me as I only use these scripts for config and show commands on an as needed basis.
 Anyways, automation is gaining traction at my workplace and management wanted to know if I could p…</span>

                              <span>I have an issue that I am trying to fix with a little scripting/automation but I need some help with the network side. 
 Problem: 
 We have an enterprise network with 50+ sites. These sites all have SDWAN routers/Cisco switches utilizing VLANS. Most of these sites have UPS’ connected via Ethernet for monitoring purposes. I need to know which interfaces these UPS’ are connected to so we can remotely check the interfaces when issues arise with the UPS monitoring system. 
 The only information I have about these UPS’ are their IPs and what site they are at. I could possibly get the macs of all the NICs but this would take a lot more time then I would like to spend on this project. 
 Question:
 What is the fastest way to go from “I know this IP is located at this site” to “I know the interface this IP is connected directly to.”
 Thanks for your help 🙏🏻

 For some time now we have been experiencing an issue on the network for a while. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out.
 When downloading a large file (usually 500 mb or higher) the download starts strong, then slows down, coming to a complete stop eventually. I&#x27;ve tested this at the router by plugging a laptop directly into our router. The download is fine there. But from the router, it goes downstream to our ASA then to our Core Switch. I tried the download directly out of the Core Switch as well and it seems like the problem starts when I am in the internal part of the network (ASA and downstream). I have been looking into QoS as other engineers have suggested. I am the only Network Engineer and I&#x27;ve been stuck on this problem for a while now. Can anyone please provide some insight to what may be happening on our network?

                              <span>Greetings!
 Have an issue with merging two Authorization Profile on one AuthZ Policy. I&#x27;m using a custom vendor radius attribute. It&#x27;s 12356 for Fortigate, id 1, named Fortinet-Group-Name. I have created the custom RADIUS Vendor attribute with the &quot; Allow multiple instances of this attribute in a profile &quot; checkbox checked.
 Case 1) If I put multiple instances in 1 Authorization Profile and apply it to a Policy, it works.
 Case 2) If I put more than one Authorization Profile on one AuthZ policy, it does not send more than 1 instance of the attribute. I&#x27;ve tested with 2 profiles where they have one attribute instance each.
 So, the RADUIS attribute seems to allow multiple instances, but the rule will not correctly merge the two AuthZ Profiles that is put on the AuthZ policy.
 The auth report in case1 correctly shows that attributed repeated 2 times as it&#x27;s supposed to, with two different group names. In case 2 however, the authZ result still matches the two AuthZ Profiles, but in the &quot;results&quot; part in the bottom only 1 radius attribute is shown.
 I&#x27;m on ISE 2.7p7. I know there is a new patch, but can&#x27;t update until next window, and cannot find any resolved caveats in p8 docs to hint that a update would work anyway. Also, I&#x27;ve verified the two cases with pcap.
 Any help appriciated.

 We don&#x27;t ever intend on using our iDracs for console and remote installs, simply power management and monitoring.
 Do you connect to full gigabit or do you use Ethernet switches for yours? Just curious others experiences.
 Trying to save ports on the gigabit if we&#x27;ll never use it.

                              <span>I am planning my third decade into the networking, I thought I should get some feedback from the community. I spent my first decade working for Cisco and Juniper in Bay Area (California). I was mainly involved in network protocol testing and verification, simulating large customer environments, doing proof of concepts, educating sales engineers, handling escalated customer issues etc. Along with tremendous learning, jobs were financially rewarding as well. However towards the end I started feeling that I am not spending enough time with family. This led me into my second decade of networking job, I joined a mid size organization as a senior network engineer. I have been working for this employer for over 11 years now. The job is very stable and work life balance is great. As you can imagine after working in a same job for such a long time, it can become boring. Although I am at senior level, I still need to do maintenance windows and hardware refreshes which I don&#x27;t enjoy any more. I am ready to pivot into my third decade of networking and looking for a job change. I intend to work 5-10 years before retiring. During my years at Cisco and Juniper, I worked closely with both Product Managers and Technical Marketing engineers. I think I am going to target one of this role for my future job. What you guys think? My in-depth understanding of networking products along with network automation experience could make a good candidate for TME role. Also my current work experience (running and operating a decent size network) could be a valuable asset to a Product Manager role. I would appreciate if people who have worked as TME or Product Manager can share their experiences. What are pros and cons of each role? From the compensation perspective, are these roles similar? Which one would be a better career path considering I have about 5-10 year left. I appreciate all the responses.

 Network Diagram is uploaded here
 Switches from Cisco, SG-350X Layer 3 switch is used at each floor and SX-350X Layer 3 switch is used as Main switch. 
 Dlink DGS-1210, L2+ switch is used at access level to which all user PC’s are connected.
 Cisco Switch had LACP and Loopback detection enabled on all the ports and LAG was done for all ports with 2 ports per group. In Dlink only for uplink port to Cisco, LACP was enabled and LAG done with 2 ports per group. (Disabled now.) 
 We are getting this LBD error logged in many switches at the same time, but there is no physical loop in the network.

                              <span>Hello everyone. 30-something male switching careers and looking for advice. 
 Long story short, spent my 20s trying to impress others rather than pursue my own interests/happiness. Obtained a BSc and PhD in biological sciences but have no intention of pursuing a career in that field.
 Recently enrolled in a 2-year college networking program. Will likely be on a wait list for another year before I can start. Looking to start teaching myself now but would like some direction.
 In your opinion, what are the most important skills for future network engineers? For example, are there particular programming languages that I should become familiar with? What Linux-based environments should I familiarize myself with?
 I am currently starting with the basics. Started a few self-directed networking crash courses on Udemy. Any help is appreciated.

 First, I deeply apologize for the title.
 Backstory: A customer of ours have a problem with their Cisco FPR 4210 (two firewalls in HA pair). When they tried to upgrade the FTD to a newer version, the secondary firewall failed and complained about that the RAM is malfunctioned. The customer contacted us and our helpdesk opened a TAC case and TAC did a RMA and send the customer a brand new chassi.. 
 To my question: Since the firewalls are active/standy, the customer mentioned that a part of the secondary firewall is active. So some interfaces and routing on the secondary firewall (the standby) is active. 
 Now Im trying to understand how this can be possible done. I do not see the logic by using an active/standby but at the same time using a part of the configuration in the stan…</span>

                              <span>Hey people. I have seen posts where people want to learn more about network design and architecture so I thought it would be good to start a discussion around something I&#x27;m working on now which involves a design for management of network devices and servers. The network devices are your usual suspects such as switches, routers, firewalls, and so on. I&#x27;ll just post some of my thoughts and let&#x27;s get a discussion going.
 Segmentation - Ideally you want to have your management network in a dedicated segment which is not accessible by all users. There are of course many ways of achieving this such as using VRFs or using a firewall. I tend to prefer VRFs as it offers complete logical isolation while a firewall requires the proper ruleset. With that said, even with the use of VRFs you will most l…</span>

The hiring manager certainly paints a positive picture about Fortinet and professes to be quite bullish on their future. However, before I &quot;drink the kool-aid&quot; I&#x27;d love to get off-the-record opinions from people who work for/with Fortinet.
 How do you feel about them, where they currently stand, and their future? Is this a good time for someone to be joining them as an SE?

                              <span>So one department was still using older 19 inch full screen (the square kind) monitors. There are 3 PC&#x27;s and each were using 3 monitors and they would have 1 thing open on each monitor.
 I thought I would argue a case for them to get new monitors and I was able to get two Samsung 27 inch monitors for each PC. Got them all hooked up the other day and the users on shift that day really liked the upgrade and even though they now had 2 instead of 3 monitors, the overall monitor space was a bit bigger.
 Well fast forward to today and some on shift today were complaining that now they have to resize windows and all that to get the same things on 2 screens that they had on 3 up at once.
 I found MS PowerToys that lets you set zones on the monitors to have program in. And I was playing around and for the most part yes it did work, but there were 2 programs that our users use that would not let me put into a Fancy Zone (the name of the zones). Is there some sort of hidden restriction on why a window would not go into a fancy zone?

                              <span>Hey All,
 Our business (around 40 people) would like me to implement a ticketing system, preferrably free or low cost.
 One thing they wanted was the ability for them to set their own priority on tickets (lame).
 I imagine I would need a service that provides a webpage for them to create the ticket so they could have that option, rather than sending it to an email.
 Any services like this?
 Edit: I just discovered spiceworks, completely free, allows a user portal with custom attributes so i&#x27;m sorted!

 Someone here recently posted that they got a new job, they had hired a professional resume writer, got some help with linked in, etc.
 desperately try to find that post so I can reach out to the user and see what specific services were used.
 Or if you can recommend one, I&#x27;d be grateful. Feeling pretty dejected right now, I loved this company

                              <span>The Minecraft package we use for SCCM uses an MSI for the installer and typically we would use the MSI to uninstall the product too. However Minecraft auto-updates so the GUID changes from the original to a different GUID that does not align with the uninstall string in the SCCM package. And the uninstall in Software Center fails. Is there an alternative way of uninstalling Minecraft. We are currently using v 1.18.32. Thanks.

                              <span>I want to assign reserved IPs with host entries based on circuit ID. I understand understand how to do this portion. The catch is that the lease is still assigned by MAC address, so if a device changes on a remote uni port it wont get a lease until the current one for the old device expires.
 I saw some references from around 2010 that specifying the circuit ID as the primary key for leases was going to be coming &quot;soon&quot;. I&#x27;m not able to find anything more resent, so I&#x27;m assuming it was never actually added, but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s an obscure enough feature that I just don&#x27;t have the right search terms.

                              <span>Currently solo with 300 entities testing Darktrace on 30-something computers and Crowdstrike on a different 30 computers.
 Solo admins out there, what is your opinion on both of the options?
 I like Darktrace&#x27;s straight-to-the-point &quot;Hey this guy is watching a Colombian webhost world cup stream on his work computer&quot; warning but its also laggy as shit on my little xps13.
 I like Falcon&#x27;s information with AD domain notifications for compromised passwords and stale accounts. Also cool to see all the vulnerabilities that I get to knock off my list of items to do.
 What EDR are you guys running?

 I just started a new job and they want me to update their existing new hire powershell script to use modern authentication or oauth2 when connecting to exchange. 
 Am i right in thinking it&#x27;s just a matter of replacing this line from the script:
 - New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell/
 with the the &quot;Connect-ExchangeOnline&quot; command?

                              <span>Need help from some of you rock star admins please. I have a 56TB Volume ReFS with deduplication enabled. It has been great with a dedup rate of over 60%. All was going well until the volume ran completely out of free space I&#x27;m talking it has 279K free. I use Veeam so this is a backup target.
 You can imagine what this has done. Server 2019 will not allow me to run any dedup operations on the volume, garbage collection nor scrubbing. I deleted a large 2TB file but I&#x27;m unable to recover that space. Every Powershell dedup command I attempt to run results in volume out of free space in Event Viewer.
 This is years worth of backup data so I&#x27;m hoping some of you can help me get this volume usable again.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Today I found out that the guy sitting next to me is making 11000 more a year than me. 
 I have 4 more years experience and have been with the company a year more. 
 I think it&#x27;s time for a new job.
 Edit: Thanks , folks. I have a meeting with my boss tomorrow. To see what up. I have also let everyone in my team know this guys pay, and a lot of people are mad. What Makes me mad is that in June, when I asked about it, I was told that all they could do is pay me 159 bucks more a year. Yes, a year.
 I knew it was time to look for a new job before this, but now I might just leave before I get a new job.
 Just so people know he has less experience, the same education started a year after me.

                              <span>Lots of ranting, end of year issues, bonus/compensation gripes. Let&#x27;s try something different. 
 What&#x27;s something you did at a job that you&#x27;re really proud of, or something clever you&#x27;ve done that&#x27;s made your life easier. Bonus points assigned as always for being cheap (As this will impress management) or for being adoptable by others (As knowledge sharing is always good.) 
 Example:
 I&#x27;m now using PiKVMs at every location to make deploying laptops easier. I have a Thunderbolt dock hooked to a PiKVM at every location of my company, and can zero to hero a laptop in an hour with it. The setup is nearly done with 1ft long HDMI and USB cables, and generally &quot;Just works.&quot; Saved my ass when I had COVID and was supposed to be rolling out new laptops as I could easily just say &quot;Put it in the place with the thing&quot;

 Does anyone else get this? I get these types of calls or emails like I&#x27;m supposed to have some sort of foresight when something breaks. We do monitor all mission critical stuff so yes we know when that&#x27;s not working. But something silly like your signature pad not working or your keyboard? No I don&#x27;t go around every day and check to make sure it works. They get very snippy with you on the phone and it&#x27;s just like I can&#x27;t fix it if I didn&#x27;t know about it.
 My short rant for the day, thanks for reading.

                              <span>What a weird problem to have, I&#x27;d have loved to have this at some of my previous places when it was constantly fire fighting.
 But the infrastructure really is in an immaculate state. Documentation is up to date, everything is patched. Not many tickets come through, and we&#x27;re often fighting for them amongst the team.
 It&#x27;s bizarre.. I&#x27;m not used to this. Apparently we&#x27;re in a &quot;quiet phase&quot;, but we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;ve tried to remain disciplined and proactive by studying, reading documentation, looking for improvements in things like monitoring and logging. But I think I&#x27;m actually better in more chaotic environments. 
 Anyone else ever been in this position?

                              <span>Is WSUS the only viable method to automate Windows patching for internal servers that will not have internet access?
 I have heard that Azure has a cloud update service that can be used to patch on premises servers, but we don’t want most of our servers to have any internet access.
 Is there a method to just give individual servers internet access as a proxy for all the other servers at that site (like you would do with a WSUS server) and then use delivery optimization or branch cache at each site to distribute the updates internally rather than allowing every server to be able to access the internet?

                              <span>I have a customer we just migrated to office 365 from intermedia hosted exchange. The clients are all outlook 2016 with modern authentication enabled Outlook just continuously prompts for the password. You enter the email address and password and there&#x27;s no error it just continuously prompts to login. They can access OWA just fine. I disabled modern authentication and re-enabled basic authentication for active sync and Outlook and then the clients are able to log in. As I can find this is not supposed to be an issue with Outlook 2016 and above. 
 Anyone have any similar experiences or ideas?

                              <span>Hello. We have a DFS server that we will be moving away from as many of our clients now no longer use Windows machines. What&#x27;s the easiest way of working out if the server is still being used by clients? Is it just enough to look at the last modified date of the folders? The Event Log seems to show just the replication between each DFS server.

                              <span>Hey everyone. I was looking for some opinions here. I searched for other posts similar to my situation, but I wanted to get some advice since many posts were a few years old.
 We could have better backup storage at my company. Currently, we have two sets of external drives attached to our backup system onsite, sitting in the same room on top of each other. Each set of drives hosts an independent copy of all of our backups. We are also copying a set of these backups into Azure.
 I was permitted to look into upgrading these off-brand external drive enclosures into a rack-mounted solution for Site A and then putting an offsite backup into Site B. I got a quote for a Synology system, but the fact that they&#x27;re forcing you to use their branded drives doesn&#x27;t sit well with us. Additionally, it would be about $10-12k for one of these systems - which was more than they wanted to spend on two systems.
 As I was thinking of alternatives, I remembered we have two SuperMicro servers (that we used to use as Hyper-V servers) that aren&#x27;t being used, each having 16x drive bays in them. Both have 256GB of RAM and plenty of processing power, even though they&#x27;re ~8 years old. I was thinking of loading TrueNAS Core onto these servers, loading up the bays with storage, using these as our physical backups at sites A and B, and then still copying a set into Azure. I have never used TrueNAS before, but I think it would accomplish what we need. I can also get some 18TB Iron Wolf Pro drives for $300/ea - so ultimately, the cost of this buildout would be the cost of the drives.
 Would you have any thoughts on this setup? Pros/cons? Alternatives I should look at? Our total footprint is 50TB, but we&#x27;re currently not doing Client Backups or O365 Backups, so that will be my next project - so I need room to expand.
 I appreciate any opinions.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi all. 
 On new laptops with Intel Graphics, there is an option called Power Savings Technology. It drives me insane as it is always adjusting the brightness and contrast of the display. 
 I know where to turn it off inside the Intel Graphics Command Centre, but does anyone have any experiencing automating the disabling of this option? I want it off for all laptops and I can’t trust those that deploy laptops to adjust this manually. 
 The guides and suggestions online don’t seem to work for me, ie the registry keys advised don’t exist. 
 Does anyone have any experience with this?

                              <span>Context:
 We use GSuite for emails, HP M575/577/578 MFPs for our printing and scanning needs. We have our own domain, take it as xx.com
 We have a specific account made for scan-to-email functions, xx.scanner@xx.com
 We have over 20 printers working properly with said account, sending emails of scans properly.
 A few weeks ago, we got 2 new HP M578 MFPs, so we started configuring them for use. Configurations we&#x27;re 1:1d from older printers, together with network settings according to company policy.
 Using smtp.gmail.com, port 587, TLS enabled. All tests pass, account validates, test email arrives.
 Test with an actual document (300kb in scan size according to other machines) - Nothing
 Test with a blank page - Arrives
 Test with a very basic text document - Arrives - Size is around 30kb
 This is where the weird part comes in, seems like the document size limit is 30kb for some reason. No other printers are experiencing this besides those two. Firmware versions etc all match.
 I tried different DNS settings etc as this was sometimes reported to be the issue, nothing.
 I also read about app passwords, but some places argue that that it isn&#x27;t needed for Google Workspace/Gsuite accounts and we still have no issues with the account on our older printers.
 Has anyone run into this before and has any recommendations on what else we could try?

 We have a Windows Server 2019 server where I&#x27;m trying to install Message Queuing feature, but it gives me the error &quot;The reference assembly could not be found. Error: 0x80073701
 I&#x27;ve tried to mount ISO and install it using the source folder.
 I&#x27;ve tried to run the DISM command, but that gives me an error as well.
 I hard stuck on what to try right now. Does anyone have something that might help me on the way?

 That is the file name, I have checked permissions as well as the files location. I have tried different file names as well including smsboot\x86\wdsmgfw.com &amp; smsboot\x86\pxeboot

 I am hoping it is a stupid checkmark I am forgetting somewhere, the logs are very vague as they just simply say connected, request for file, cannot open file. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi there guys!
 I am working quite some time now to a really nice company that offers a lot flexibility including a lot remote working and although the management would like more of us to be more often to office most people for various reasons (some are living on other cities) are ignoring it.
 This month though there was more pressure like our manager of our team asked us to choose TWO days per month that as a team will be gathering on the office and i see they are trying to establish it especially from January of the next year.
 Thats not a problem for me and its nice to see other members of the team that i dont see often , however i&#x27;d like to have the choice especially for summers that i travel a lot to my home country etc to be able to stay longer without having to be in office for just for the sake of being in office.
 So far i have to visit the office maybe even 6 months LOL
 I feel that like a step back in terms of freedom and i am afraid if they get ideas to start asking more days per month...
 I was thinking if there are ways that still i can keep avoiding the presence in office...Like just not comply fully as many other have done in various situations?
 Like maybe attend at first a few times in office but then just only attend one per month or having excuses for not being in office ?bring up health issues or anything ?

                              <span>We are trying to access a network drive from a Win 2019 file server to a tablet running iPadOS 16 that is connected to our network over a Global Protect VPN connection. When trying to make the connection, we get an authentication failed message. 
  
 Verified we can connect to the server and folder from a computer on the network.
 Verified we can connect to both over VPN from an Android on cellular.
 Verified SMB 2 and SMB 3 are enable on the server.
 Verified issue from multiple devices, user accounts, and destination servers.
 VPN connects successfully, and the device can be seen on the network.
 The account used to try and access the server will lock if the wrong password is used.
 Tried using IP, domain name, FQDN, SMB://[server], server\path.
  
Has anyone else out there seen this issue and have a fix?

My research concluded that the easiest way is to somehow interface the 3Par to a regular server and wipe the disks with something like Blancco. How would I go about connecting the 3Par System directly to a server? What connectors/cables/protocols should be used? Enterprise storage tech is pretty new to me.

                              <span>Hi, my college got hit my Lorenz ransomware. It&#x27;s been a fun week. As i&#x27;m sure many of you know, schools dont have the biggest IT budgets so we&#x27;re responding with a bare bones team.
 We have an on-prem Exchange with an Exch relay and AD sync server - i think with bidirectional sync - to our o365 tenant. 
 We have brought back our servers from backups, but havent placed the AD sync server back in prod yet because we were told that Lorenz ransomware sometimes exfiltrate your mailboxes after a ransomware incident by scraping mailboxes after reconnecting AD sync. 
 Do you have any idea how i should approach this?
 I was thinking:
 1) Use global admin in o365 to review any suspicious accounts, privileged accounts etc and identify ones which need a password reset (board isnt letting me do a ful pw global reset :/ ) 
 2) go onto on prem domain controller and do an AD review there for suspicious accounts etc
 3) when both o365 and on prem AD have been reviewed, put the AD sync back into prod but with active sync disabled
 4) then when the server appears to be working, re-enable activesync
 Is there something i&#x27;m missing?

I wonder what if we create dev/sda5 as extended partition and then create PV and extend VG. Anything we should worry about?

                              <span>Hello. I hope you can give me a pointer on what is happening. The setup is simple. I have a 4000GB Hdd, connected to a W10 client with a USB docking station. Disk management shows the correct size and one huge NTFS schema. Then i connect the HDD to an Ubuntu Client to transfer some data. Ubuntu can mount NTFS and i can copy/edit my data. After moving 400gb to the client i disconnect and put the hdd back into the other docking station at my windows client. Now NTFS seems to be gone and i see 2 non allocated parts with discmanager. 1. 2048GB 2. 1678.02GB
 I guess something on the Ubuntu client isn&#x27;t liking NTFS and erase/change my partition table?

                              <span>I’ve worked quite a bit with on-prem and Azure setups but am currently planning my first Hybrid rollout. Trying to find a number on how long a device can go without having line of sight to the internal network/DC. 
 With 140ish users we have one, maybe two devices that will spend more than a day at a time away from the office (up to a month I’m told is the max) so we would like to avoid the complexities of configuring Intune and having different management protocols for these two devices but want to make sure how long they can go without checking in. They will still have internet connectivity so they are able to check in with Azure but not the internal network in our current plan. 
 Any advice is appreciated, I can’t find anything about this online and want to make sure we have everything in order before we get too deep in this project.
 Edit for clarification: right this moment these users are using local users and manually copying/emailing any files that need saved in company file shares, etc. We are working to make sure all devices are managed and users and company data are both controlled while having access to company resources when on the road.

We found out pretty quickly so no harm done but I was just wondering if there&#x27;s anything we can do with that phone number. Any way to report it or is it just not worth the time?

 I did two configurations, but I can&#x27;t disable the search box from showing web results from Windows 10.
 Configuration 1 - Group policy
 I have enabled below 3 GPO but I am still able to search the web via the search box. 
 ​
 Do not allow web search
 ​
 Don&#x27;t search the web or display web results in Search
 ​
 don&#x27;t search the web or display web results in search over metered connections
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Configuration 2 - Regedit
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
 - Created under Windows key and chose New &gt; Key.
 - Renamed the Key name: Explorer. Created Explorer key and selected New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value.
 - Renamed the key to DisableSearchBoxSuggestions. Changed the DWORD and set the value from 0 to 1. Applied and restarted the PC, but no results.
 ​
 Can anyone help me to fix this issue?

What the final policy will be regarding the use of this and other similar tools is something that will need to be discussed with Stack Overflow staff and, quite likely, here on Meta Stack Overflow.
 Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking or looking for correct answers.
 The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, 
 We have a group policy issue with our accounts. After performing the recent Cumulative Update for Win10 21H2, the user group policy is not applying. This previously worked.
 We did have RM (UK educational network software vendor) remote in and tell us some GPO changes we made were in the wrong place (GPM, rather than RMMC, the RM management software), but i&#x27;m unsure if their changes have affected it. (though i&#x27;m sure it worked before they remoted in). RM themselves are as stumped as we are.
 Inheritance looks OK, the GPOs have the right settings, but for some reason, it&#x27;s just not picking up the user GPO. The affected accounts largely seem to be legacy Roaming Profile accounts that have been converted to UEV.
 Anything i could have missed? Could there be legacy cruft affecting it? Anyone experienced the same sort of issues?
 If this is the wrong place for these sort of questions, ping me and i&#x27;ll move it :)

 On the things I should develop and work on he wrote I need to take and show an ownership of a product that was given to me temporarily after my co-worker resigned.
 ( They never hired anyone )
 End of the review “ Met Most Expectations” 
 PS! looking back at all the contributions I made for this org and the things i helped develop and design, what a waste.
 How do you guys interpret that? Thanks

                              <span>I work in IT but need this for my personal life. I would like to send out an email with a link to download a file. The recipient should only be able to download it once and the link would also expire in a specified time frame. If there were an issue with the download they would have to re-request it from me. The file size is about 1.5 GB.
 This website (https://www.cloudfiles.io/) does all that I am asking but costs 20 a month. I&#x27;m not charging anything for the download so I would like to find a free way to do this. I&#x27;ve looked into some sort of combination of Google Drive and 7zip but nothing so far will do everything I want it to do. I do pay for a personal Google Drive account with plenty of storage. So if I can do it through google I would like to.

                              <span>Hey guys! Just recently got a new job, doing some higher level infrastructure for a company of 1600 people and 60 locations, with an IT team of 4 (me being the networking guy). I’m just starting to really grasp tunnels, VLANs and trunking concepts in a large company. I’m currently doing network discovery for these locations as they dropped their MSP last month. I worked for a msp previously but we generally supported smaller offices with pretty basic networks without switches, subnets, and VLANs. They use several VLANs across the network at my new job. They’re using fortigates and dell switches primarily. I’m trying to familiar myself with these concepts to help understand the network more.
 Now looking at the static routes on the fortigate firewalls I can see and understand how VLANs and different subnets are communicating. My question is, do you need to setup static routes on a switch with VLANs as well? I’m thinking they would have similar static routes, explaining what IP schemes can communicate over a L3 switch? Or am I overthinking this?
 Thanks for any advice! We’re a small team and sometimes I feel like I have nobody to lean on for questions like this.

                              <span>I have a pair of Nexus3K&#x27;s connecting to a varied bunch of 2960, 3650, and 3560X switches via 1000base-SX over OM4 fiber. The optics themselves were all purchased within the last couple of years and come from multiple vendors-- primarily FS.com, Approved Networks, and knock-off Cisco. Slowly over time they all seem to die at a rate about 1 or 2 a month. One day they&#x27;re fine, the next day current draw spikes and the TX drops off a cliff. The crazy thing is that I have some modules that have been in service for almost 20 years, and they work just fine.
 Anyone else experiencing this with SX SFP&#x27;s recently?

 Would prefer to keep speeds as close to the source speed as possible but expect degradation of course.
 Wondering if the TP Link CPE710 on each end would work well in this scenario?

                              <span>Good afternoon!
 The company I work for is currently running some decade-old Catalyst 2900-series switches in each of our buildings. These were configured by our previous IT admin, who is no longer with the company. I have been managing them without issue for the last few years, but it&#x27;s finally time to replace them.
 We bought 6 replacement switches (Catalyst 9200 series). 3 will be in our server-room stack, 2 in a secondary building stack, and 1 at our remote site as a standalone.
 Because I haven&#x27;t handled an install from scratch before, I was hoping someone could review my sanitized config for the standalone switch. This network is very simple, with a separate router and DHCP handled through our domain controllers.

 I&#x27;ve been grinding on a VPN problem for about a day and I&#x27;m running out of steam on this one.
 I have a new Cat9300X stack running IOS-EX 17.9.1r with the HSEC and DNA Advantage license. I&#x27;m attempting to create a tunnel to AWS. This is the standard 1--&gt;2 tunnel config where there are two AWS endpoints and one customer gateway. For now, however, I&#x27;m only focusing on one tunnel. There will be BGP but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be relevant to the issue at hand.
 What I&#x27;ve got is a topology that looks like this (basically) [INTERNAL 192.168.X.X VLAN 300]-&gt;[9300X]-&gt;[VLAN200-169.254.254.1]---[Tunnel2001-169.254.165.178]--[GW FW]-----&gt;[AWS VPN Gateway 50.61.72.83]--[TunnelIP-169.254.165.177]

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m having difficulties with Vendor configuration files for EC120-F5, EC220-G5 and EC230-G1.
 After creating a Config file and uploading it to a new router via AginetACS, the new router gets same SSID and PIN as the device I&#x27;ve created the config with.
 I&#x27;ve read the Aginet Config Operation Manual but could not find a solution.
 Tried setting the password to &quot;?undefined?&quot; in General config and the SSID as &quot;Name_XXXX_2G&quot; (XXXX should be replaced with last symbols of each device&#x27;s MAC address, 6.2 - 6.3 in the manual). Tried uploading config straight from the router I&#x27;ve created it with and from Aginet Config Server. No luck. 
 Can anybody please help with some information on how to properly create the Vendor Configutarion Files, including Account Permission Settings and custom SSID with specific router&#x27;s PIN as wireless key, that fits any newly connected router to network? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got two cisco 3850 connecting two datacenters. Fiber work was scheduled for the direct connection between them so the interfaces were shut down preemptively forcing traffic the long way around on our redundant (lower bandwidth) path.
 After the work was done, i &quot;no shut: the interfaces. The interfaces lit up, but only one side could see the neighbor. Not able to ping eachother.
 The interfaces are trunks with the native vlan interface IP&#x27;d for routing protocols.
 For kicks i issued no switchport and moved the IPs to the interfaces and they came back up and are able to ping eachother.
 So somehow this issue is related to layer 2/vlans. Any ideas?
 fixed ---
 I bounced the side that was not seeing the neighbor, and everything came back up normal. Something must have flaked in that switch when i shut down those interfaces. I checked to make sure that they were in agreement as far as root bridges for vlans, but since the native vlan wasn&#x27;t coming up, both thought they were the root bridge. I&#x27;m assuming that is normal under the circumstances as they could not communicate, but the whole thing is really weird. I would&#x27;ve really liked to have found out what was causing the issue.
 Thanks for all the suggestions, folks!

                              <span>Hi all-
 As subject says; we have bad address entries in our DHCP pool. Some background:
 2 dhcp servers with failover pools (Windows Server 2022)
 Have a Cisco 4500X for layer 3 routing. This switch has dhcp helper information for each vlan
 Now, the oddities:
 -I can&#x27;t find any other dhcp server on our network of any kind, in any of the vlans
 -Only certain wired vlans are affected; the data vlans for end user PC&#x27;s. Our wireless, phone, security camera, clock and management vlans are unaffected.
 -We don&#x27;t exhaust the pool; we will get a random number of bad address entries, usually about a third of the amount of wired desktop PC&#x27;s
 -I have set the DHCP lease time to 6 hours, which results in much fewer bad address entries. If I bump it up to 2-3 days or more, I will have double or triple the amount of entries.
 ​
 I&#x27;m suspecting it might be some of our Dell desktops (optiplex 3060, Win 10 and 11 Enterprise for clients) that is the issue; in the 5 vlans affected, all of the desktops are the same model Dell. For the life of me, however, I&#x27;m not sure why this might be an issue. I have sort of a working theory, but have not tested it out yet; the desktops go to sleep at the end of the day; then are woke up by employees the next morning. They try to get their prior address, but it is listed in the scope, so they get another. 
 Anyone else ever have something similar?
 Thanks all!

 In my environment we have layer 3 switches (cisco 3850 stacks) and they go directlly to a NGFW (fortigate) is there a need to put a router in between the switch and firewall if the firewall does the routing? Like what are the benefits.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m configuring a network between 2 sites. In order to ensure redundancy I have 2 paths between the sites with different weighted routes. These paths are tunneled between 2 routers and when the primary router tunnel goes down it takes the firewall anywhere between 30 secs to a 1:30 before switching to the alternate route. Is there anyway I can configure the asa to drop and switch routes quicker? Please let me know if I need to provide more information. Thank you!

 Cisco 2900 series is connected to another 2900 series via port 49 with a fiber cable. Got lights on both sides. NOTHING is plugged into this switch. I get an email saying their whole team when down. Just this team. I unplug the port 49 and it happens again. They all lose connection for a moment then back to network connection...Wtf?
 I&#x27;ve ssh&#x27;d into the both of the switches. The new one has a Mac address table with nothing plugged in. Just noticed the the new switch duplicated the 130 macs from the other switch.
 What the f$%k gives? Confused.

 On Monday my business had some sort of power event that caused our firewall, main switch (hp-2510-48), phone system and one of our active directory/dns servers to power cycle before coming back online. After that in a seemingly random pattern, various end point devices can no longer connect to the network, and for those devices that can, the network latency is through the roof. Before, on average packet loss would be maybe 1/100 if we were looking, now it is 40-60% packet loss. 
 Our initial investigation showed that plugging directly into …</span>

                              <span>Hi r/networking, 
 I&#x27;m relatively new to networking and have a weird circumstance that I&#x27;m not sure how to tackle. 
 I connect manufacturing equipment to our client&#x27;s WAN on a regular basis. Our manufacturing equipement has an internal LAN with the IP scheme, 192.168.100.XXX, and I use a router to NAT to static IPs on our client&#x27;s network that they provide. 
 It&#x27;s usually smooth sailing, I configure the router to the dedicated IPs the client provides and we&#x27;re good to go. 
 My trouble is my client&#x27;s WAN is 192.168.100.XXX as well. So NATing would be pointless and I cannot reserve all of IPs of my machine on their network. 
 Would there be a good way to not create conflict? My initial thought is to use a VLAN so my equipment&#x27;s LAN sees the VLAN and their WAN sees the VLAN and neither ever sees each other, I don&#x27;t actually know if this is possible or the best course of action. Any guidance is much appreciated!

                              <span>Hello!
 ​
  
What I am doing:
  
Testing platform to see disruptions and to check to see if my software can detect these.
 I am sending packets from a IP to a multicast address then to another IP.
 For example: (#1 IP)192.168.1.1 sends it to (#2 Multi)235.1.200.1 and then it goes to (#3 IP)192.168.1.15.
 I am on a external computer (Connected to same network switch). I have been trying to spoof the #1 and 2 IPs. So that the messages goes from #1 to (ME #4) then to the #2 Multi then #4.
 It doesn&#x27;t really matter the order as long as I can see a loss, delay effect on either end of the network.
 ​
  
What I need:
  
I need a way to intercept and control the flow of these packets. I need to represent a loss of packets, and delay the time which the packets send at.
 ​
  
Things I have tried:
  
I have been using Ettercap and TC Qdisc to try and make this work. I can receive the packets with Ettercap, but when I try and use TC Qdisc it doesn&#x27;t have any effect.
 I originally tested just going from IP1 to IP2 and used Ettercap to spoof these ips. I then used TC Qdisc to control the loss packets, delay, duplicate, and corruption of these packets and it Does work.
 ​
 In my original test without multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 &gt;&gt; 192.168.1.15
 192.168.1.15 &gt;&gt; 192.168.1.1
 ​
 With multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 &gt;&gt; 235.1.200.1
 192.168.1.15 &gt;&gt; 235.1.200.1
 I tired getting between the host and multi and tried applying the effects there but no luck. 
 192.168.1.15 &gt;&gt; (ME TC QDISC HOST) &gt;&gt; 235.1.200.1
 ​
  
Question to you:
  
What are my options here. If you have experience with this feel free to share your approach.
 Is there another way to go about this? If so please let me know.

                              <span>Just found a weird probable one off. 
 Customer procures a /30
 Modem placed into a bridge mode, scripted with static block. Configure FW with /30 and point to other /30
 We see a user with a public IP address on their LAN.
 I learn they patched directly into modem because &quot;That&#x27;s the way we&#x27;ve always done it.&quot;
 anyone seen this before? Completely different WAN IP range, which is obvious but I wouldn&#x27;t expect that to work like it did.

                              <span>I lose console access to the cEdges (8000v) after rebooting the lab. On initial setup, I still have access even after attaching the devices to templates / config groups. But when I stop the lab and start it back up at a later time I just get a blank screen on the console of the cEdges. My template changes are still deployed and I&#x27;m able to pass traffic, so they&#x27;re still working. It&#x27;s just console access that&#x27;s broken. Tried it on a bunch of different labs running different code and same thing happens on all of them. Any ideas on why I can&#x27;t console in after a restart?

 We are working on implementing TACACS to manage admin login to client and core routers. I understand the router side configuration. But can&#x27;t seem to grasp the best practices for implementing the TACACS server itself.
 We use Ubuntu servers but as I understand tac_plus is no longer supported on Ubuntu? I came across TACAS.net is this the way to go? I have exhausted all my google queries. Any advice?

(In my assignment) I have done the small since I know/familoar the real life small networks. I included café , restaurants, schools and small businesses as small networks and I choose to write either bus or star topology could be used. So I need help for medium and large networks. Since I don&#x27;t which real life networks are considered as medium or large. Please, I request help.

                              <span>I have a number of Cisco ASA devices that i want to upgrade the ASA/ASDM software on.
 The all run in active / standby mode.
 I have a mixture of ASA5525-X, ASA5545-X and ASA5555-X devices.
 ​
 They all run:
 Current ASA version &#x3D; 9.8(4)10
 Current ASDM &#x3D; 7.13(1)
 Current FXOS &#x3D; 2.2(2.121)
 ​
 I want to upgrade to:
 ASA latest verion &#x3D; 9.14.4
 ASDM latest version &#x3D; 7.19.1
 ​
 But what about the FXOS version - do i need to upgrade that ?
 I&#x27;m having trouble finding a clear explanation as Cisco documentation invariably points to firepower devices.
 ​
 That said i discovered the document below. 
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/upgrade/asa-upgrade/asa-appliance-asav.html#topic_r5l_tt5_bbb
 ​
 Just to confirm i do not have a physical firepower module in any of the ASA devices.
 ​
 Is there a software file I need to download for the FXOS ?
 ​
 Any help much appreciated.

                              <span>I have a 1000$ training budget to spend by years&#x27; end. I&#x27;m looking for network automation training resources.
 What I feel I would benefit mostly from:
 -How to deploy an easy to maintain application (git, jenkins, docker), general devops stuff. I know how to use these tools in a rudimentary fashion, but I feel I don&#x27;t know how to put them all together.
 -Popular Python network automation libraries (netmiko, nornir, napalm).
 I already have access to O&#x27;reilly&#x27;s library and Linkedin Learning.
 I&#x27;ve looked at INE but they don&#x27;t have anything in the area of automation, CBT nuggets looks promising - I&#x27;m going to try their 7 day trial. ipspace.net&#x27;s Individual standard subscription also looks promising.
 What trainings in this area did you have a good experience with and you would recommend?

 I work in network security for a few years and I would love to learn more about designing networks, with of course security best practices.
 Can you please point out some good resources and/or certificates for secure network design/architect? I found TOGAF, but I feel like it&#x27;s more Project Manager or Architect focused on processes, not the network architecture itself.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi
 Can someone please help me:
 Simple Network architecture:
 https://imgur.com/a/xYzEAOU
 Cloud management subnet is 192.168.222.0 with a mask of 255.255.255.0 and the Gateway IP is 192.168.222.1 which also runs a DHCP server:
 On the eve-ng host:
 root@eve-ng:~# route
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 default pfsense.skubsad 0.0.0.0UG 0 0 0 pnet0
 192.168.222.0 0.0.0.0255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 pnet0
 ​
 Steps to reproduce:
  
​ 
 Add a new Cloud Network on the topology with network type set to Management(Cloud0).
 
 2. Add a new Virtual PC (VPC) to the topology
 3. Connect VPC to Management Cloud. Start the VPC
  
Expected behavior:
 The Interface connected to Cloud 0 on the VPC should get a DHCP assignment from upstream DHCP server (1922.168.222.1).
 Observed behavior:
 No DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0. However, after static assignment, I&#x27;m able to ping upstream DHCP server (192.168.222.1).
 Question:
  
Why no DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0?
 After static assignment, I am able to ping the DHCP server 192.168.222.1, but it does not pick up DHCP by itself?
  
​
 Thank you in advance
 Best Regards

                              <span>I did the job-hopping, get the money, move to consulting and sales, and made the money.
 After a lot of years, the kids are grown, the bills are paid, and I&#x27;m in a place where I don&#x27;t need to make a pile of cash to be happy.
 So, I took a job at a local college. I get amazing benefits, a chance to pad my retirement, and I actually believe in what I am doing. I get up, do my best to help kids in school, then go home. The new job is literally blocks from my house.
 No more early middle of the night / early morning calls.
 No more late night bullshit. No more &quot;emergencies.&quot; If I do get called in, I walk up, then go in late the next day.
 The users? Bringing a ton of years of enterprise level-experience and customer service habits allow me to just fucking kill it here.
 I wish I could have afforded to do this before.

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I have a Sophos SG115 that I&#x27;ve just freshly configured and would like to connect a Sophos APX120 to the UTM but I can&#x27;t seem to get it working. I&#x27;m pretty new to Sophos, and firewalls in general, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something super basic. 
 As it is right now, I have the wireless AP connected to a PoE injector, and then connected to the LAN port of the SG115. The AP turns on and boots fine, but gets stuck on a flashing amber light, which according to the manual means the AP is not claimed by the wireless controller. I&#x27;m wondering if maybe I need to create a new DHCP server on the UTM? When I check the IPv4 Lease Table there&#x27;s nothing listed, so it&#x27;s clearly not picking up that the AP is connected. Or at least not assigning an IP via DHCP. 
 If anyone has any experience with this and had some tips or guidance it would be super appreciated. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am working on a Hyper-V configuration where I need to pass multiple VLANs on the same network interface (tagged sub-interfaces).
 Within the VMWare world, this is easy. A Port group assigned to VLAN 4095.
 Within Hyper-V, I used the Powershell command:
 Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -VMName &quot;VM-Name&quot; -VMNetworkAdapterName &quot;DATA&quot; -NativeVlanId 0 -AllowedVlanIdList 1-4094 -trunk 
 Per my understanding, that puts the NIC into &quot;Trunk&quot; mode, allows all VLANs, and doesn&#x27;t allow a Native VLAN (so only tagged traffic will flow) - I also tried native to 1.
 Unfortunately, from a PCAP it looks like Hyper-V is stripping the 802.1q tag from the frames. So I am seeing traffic from all of the different VLANs - but without their tags. That&#x27;s not going to work...
 Is there something else that needs to be defined for Hyper-V to pass the tags not just the payload?

                              <span>So I have a physical 2019 server with a TPM that has the OS and data drives Bitlocker encrypted using TPM.
 I need to take the server off the current domain and move it to a totally different domain.
 I have Bitlocker recovery keys and will generate fresh ones before doing this but is there anything I need to consider when I do this?
 The option to allow TPM was set using GPO and when it&#x27;s taken off this domain that GPO won&#x27;t apply but the drives are already encrypted.
 I&#x27;m not 100% sure what the behavior will be when it restarts off the existing domain and I don&#x27;t have a spare physical server to try this on.
 If I have to enter the recovery key that&#x27;s OK so long as the volumes unlock :)

                              <span>Hi All,
 While not actually a blank slate, we are currently full embedded into SCCM. We are having plenty of difficulties patching third party applications and don&#x27;t have the man power to keep packaging apps.
 While we looked and trialed PatchMyPC and worked really well, a subsidiary of ours isn&#x27;t using MECM and has all their devices enrolled into Intune/Endpoint Manager. This was fine, until we went to enroll the terminal servers, which at that point realised Microsoft doesn&#x27;t support Endpoint Manager for MS Server.
 So now we are looking at RMM tools to help us with, application deployment and patching. I have come across a number of tools, and NinjaOne seems to be on top. But their pre-sales are frustrating and constantly want me to do a demo session with their techs instead of just giving me a price on the 2500 devices I want to cover.
 I checked out Gartner, but it doesn&#x27;t do quadrants for this in particular, more so unified desktop management which brings MS Endpoint Manager to the top.
 If anyone could chime in on if you had a blank slate, what would you do? Also the business will not touch SolarWinds with a 10ft pole because of the scandal last year/year before and I have heard mixed reviews on ManageEngine&#x27;s Desktop Central.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard a bit about ChatGPT over the last few days and finally decided to try it out.
 It&#x27;s.. Incredible at what it does. I asked it, to spin up a series of nodes in AWS with IAC, running one of the applications I support, and also implement DR for those nodes. And within seconds, I had a workable script that did exactly what I had asked it to do. 
 I&#x27;ve run it against a bunch of different scenarios and overall it seems more competent at coding than about 90% of the people I&#x27;ve worked with, myself included.
 Even vaguely querying errors returns answers better than what you&#x27;d typically receive from any vendor support over the course of days, in seconds.
 So what are the implications here - where does everyone see the field going? I honestly didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d get to this point for another several years, minimum. I&#x27;m starting to think I might need to re-skill and move over to pure development just to stay afloat in the next few years.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been the System Administrator for a small credit union for the last 7 years. I am the only IT person. We have about 30 pc&#x27;s between our two locations with multiple servers on site. We don&#x27;t have an active directory. The examiners are really starting to crack down on our IT management, but I don&#x27;t have the toolset to really provide much more management. They want encryption, patch management, etc....Also, improving IT/Security isn&#x27;t where the CU wants to spend their money.
 What&#x27;s the best way to learn how to harden the network itself internally? Like set up an Active Directory? Where can I sandbox some of this before trying to present it to management? Where can I learn more? If anyone has any tips or ideas, I really appreciate it as I am pretty much on my own on this. Low cost options are appreciated as I will not be reimbursed by my institution.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am a field engineer for a large MSP. We have never had any good imaging processes. On the day to day pc replacement, we just use the dell default image, go through the oobe and install everything by hand in-person, then manage the rest with our RMM. For a re-image, we just use the media creation tool image and once again go through the oobe, join domain, install software. 
 For large scale replacements, (When win7 went EOL) we had a process where we would upgrade the PC to win10, and then use Macrium reflect to clone the PC onto a brand new PC. This was relatively quick and effective at the time, however over the last 2 years we have had constant issues with a lot of the cloned machines and ended up re-imaging most one by one. 
 I have been asking management to start doing the Dell Image Assist, where we get them from dell mostly pre-imaged, but they decline every time. 
 Well, now, one of our larger clients just had 150 new Pc&#x27;s delivered, that they need installed, and the ticket has been just dropped onto me to get it done. This would require me to unbox, complete the oobe, rename the PC, join it to the domain, install chrome, adobe reader, office 365, and their specialized software. And then on a per user basis install their respective printers, scanners, other devices. 
 Anyone have any ideas on the fastest way to get these PC&#x27;s deployed? Sysprep drive duplicating? Creating 1 image and then sysprepping and then trying to clone it out to the rest of them?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 When I was on the Service Desk, I frequently solved issues by restarting the computer. 
 At some point, I got tired of asking the user to restart the computer, or arguing with the user that they in fact haven&#x27;t restarted their computer in a month. 
 I made this script. I hope it helps someone out there. 
 I designed it so you can keep it running in Powershell and punch in the host name for a computer to check the uptime. I&#x27;m a Powershell novice. 
 do{$RemoteComputer &#x3D; read-host -prompt &#x27;Which computer are you inquiring about?&#x27; IF((Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName $RemoteComputer -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).pscomputername -like $remotecomputer) {(Get-Date) - (Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName $RemoteComputer).LastBootupTime} else {&quot;Computer not found&quot;} } until(Read-host -prompt &#x27;Press Enter to continue...&#x27;)

 What are some of the things you wish your predecessors had or had not done to make your life easier? For instance, we have a 5 year plan in place to go to 365. I will be gone before that project even starts but what could I do to make it easier for when the time comes?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious what other sysadmins are doing to prepare for the Windows 10 end of life and end of support in October 2025 (147 weeks) I&#x27;ve seen some &quot;never Win11&quot; discussions. 
 We are 15% Win11 now for our pilot ring, and all new deployments are Win11. No issues save one - an old VPN software from the state. No user or IT complaints so far. Some of our data is under federal regulation and cannot be on unpatched or unsupported systems so being on an unsupported OS is not an option. We have other systems and unregulated data on very old software written for Win XP that has no trouble running on Win11.
 To minimize IT support and troubleshooting and dual documentation for end users, I am hoping to make the transition quickly. Aiming for 100% in the next 12 months, but I suspect that like most of my deadlines that will slip.
 Are you testing Windows 11? What is your timeline for upgrading? Any issues?

                              <span>Sitting here at home and sipping on some gin and tonic, I had an epiphany. I made it! Not “I’m rich” made it but “I found a place where I want to be” made it. This is the first time I’ve taken time off in my new role and after 4 days I actually miss the job. Been here for about 9 months now and I can honestly say that this is where I want to work for the foreseeable future. The MSP I work for does it all right and ticks all the boxes. Good salary comp for the kind of work I do, social, perks and benefits, company culture, work life balance, useful teammates, you name it. Sure we get dickhead users and silly requests like everyone does, but somehow the way the company manages all of this make this a non-issue.
 All that corporate mumbo jumbo about culture, all the Richard Branson quotes, the LinkedIn posts that talk about stuff - this place actually does all of that, for real, and no one waffles on about it. A recruiter emailed me the other day offering an interview for a position with better working times and 25% better pay and I replies saying not interested before I read the full spec. 
 I don’t have a motivational quote or a moral lesson to finish off on, just felt like sharing. I guess what I want to say is that these places to exist, it just feels surreal.

 Dedicated Fiber and Coax both effected.
 Anyone happen to have any information?

                              <span>We get tons of &#x27;automated&#x27; emails, some sales and some not, from vendors sent through Salesforce and the majority of them are marked as spam by our mail gateway because they fail the SPF check. These are big vendors like Verizon etc. Is this an issue on their end? Should I just create a policy that doesn&#x27;t SPF check messages sent through Salesforce? Or just leave them being marked as spam. Curious how others handle this. And it isn&#x27;t just Salesforce. It&#x27;s any 3-rd party, automated, mass-email system that vendors like to use to send emails on their behalf but maintain their email address in the header.

We have a user who has left the company who had access to tons of sharepoints, most of which were created before our company was sold to another. So those sharepoints still exist but are essentially never used, except some documents we have are using macros to access old data in them. 
 I want to grant all this sharepoint access to that employee&#x27;s replacement so she can use these files normally, but for the life of me I cannot find a way to just simply list all of the sharepoint sites a user account has access to. I might be being dumb as hell but I can&#x27;t find it in 365 admin/sharepoint admin. 
 I just want to see:
 John Doe Sharepoint Access: Site A Site B Site C
 etc.

                              <span>Hello sysadmins... 
 Since the November 2022 Security update when we are prompted for the &#x27;Browse for Folder&#x27; dialog on our Windows 11 machines, only &quot;Desktop&quot; is listed.
 Some forum posts have confirmed this to be a problem when using OneDrive desktop redirection but no solution or workaround other than disabling redirection or removing the update. Neither are options in our corporate environment.
 Is anyone else dealing with this and have any ideas for a solution? 
 Many Thanks!
 Windows 11 22H2 with KB5019980 installed.
 OneDrive Desktop Folder Redirection on.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use for my core switching datacenter 4 juniper switches,
 2 EX-4600 with 24 port sfp 10G with 2 EX-4300 48 ports RJ45 1G, each 2 models are virtual chassis and connected with 4 qsfp.
 These are legacy I got and dated from 2016.
 I&#x27;m interested in replacing them with either cisco or aruba(heard some good things on arista as well).
 Would welcome advise on equivalent newer models and some general and personal experiences you had with them.
 Feel free to suggest other options or anything useful to important things to know.
 Thx in advance

                              <span>I may have screwed up a bit and need some help. Our IS team ran a Purple Knight scan against our AD environment to look for potential configuration issues. One thing they found was a high number of users that had adminCount set to 1. Their recommendation was to clear the adminCount for all standard users and see how many of them return to an adminCount of 1 the next time SDPROP runs and review the list at that time.
 I inadvertently cleared the adminCount for ALL AD objects instead of just the standard user objects. In other words, the builtin groups that are supposed to be protected were also cleared. When I realized this, I set the adminCount for those groups and 2 users (administrator and krbtgt) to adminCount&#x3D;1.
 Admittedly, my understanding of how SDPROP works could be way off but my expectation would be that when SDPROP runs, any users of those protected groups should have thier adminCount set to 1, inheritance disabled and their ACL replaced with the same permissions as what are on the AdminSDHolder object.
 However nothing is getting the adminCount set back to 1, not even domain admin group members. I don&#x27;t know how to check to make sure that SDPROP is running or not. I checked the PDC for the registry entry that controls the SDPROP frequency (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters\AdminSDProtectFrequency) and it doesn&#x27;t exist so it should be running every hour by default. I even tried triggering SDPROP manually.
 Any ideas of what I could check next or what I might be missing? Do I need to set adminCount&#x3D;1 on the AdminSDHolder object?

 The problem is: After the next Azure AD Connect sync, the accounts are re-enabled in Azure AD. I understand the behavior, but need to prevent this somehow. 
 Do any of you have a good idea for me?

                              <span>As title suggests, I’d like to add my personal Apple ID to my work laptop but I’m obviously pretty apprehensive of the security/privacy concerns associated with doing so. My company appears to use Jamf as its Mac MDM and I haven’t fully explored to see if there are any keyloggers/spyware installed etc. However, I was just wondering what the risks are with adding my personal Apple ID to my work machine? It’s worth noting that I don’t intend to check any of the boxes in the iCloud system preference page; this would purely be for handoff features and the like and I wouldn’t synchronise any services such as iMessage, photos, iCloud Drive etc (although maybe private relay could be useful). As far as I know, to get features like universal control and unlock with Apple Watch to work you need to have both an iPad and a MacBook on the same primary Apple ID as even things like notes and reminders don’t work with a secondary Apple ID.

                              <span>What would you guys do in this situation?
 We are located in a secure facility that requires background checks for all vendors. We also have a contract with Canon copiers to service them whenever they break down or need replacing. We have a copier that is broken but our facility won&#x27;t let the techs in without the background check. Canon is not being cooperative in allowing their techs to complete the BG check. I believe the techs may not even have social security numbers which is holding things up. The facility won&#x27;t let the techs enter in without the clearance.
 I (on-site help desk) will be out starting next week for the holidays.
 I have a few options I can think of:
  
Short term, wait until tech gets cleared, but they haven&#x27;t been responsive
 Bring copier outside the facility and somehow tech can service it out on the street? This seems counter intuitive and hard to do.
 Get tools from Canon directly and fix myself?
 long term, get a smaller copier (that IT can fix) not on a contract and/or eliminate the contract with canon.
 Resign my position as the facility is preventing me from doing my job which is to coordinate these things

                              <span>I&#x27;m having some trouble finding out if this feature was implemented, last I can find is the post 2 years ago about implementing it for Partners saying it&#x27;s coming soon for B2B orgs - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/new-organization-switcher-in-the-microsoft-365-admin-center/ba-p/1165543
 But a video posted in 2021 to their official channel says it is &quot;rolling out&quot; for Azure B2B - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;co08qYurtzgt&#x3D;1900
 But an article updated in the last 2 months still says &quot;allows Microsoft 365 partner admins the ability to administer all the tenants they manage from a single location&quot; - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage?view&#x3D;o365-worldwidehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide
 To clarify, Azure AD Admin multi-org through B2B is working fine , but really need the access on the 365 Admin. I currently cannot get the Organization Switcher to show anywhere (outside of Azure AD Admin).

                              <span>I usually install office by going to office.com signing in and install office. Is the procedure different for a domain PC that will be used by multiple users? Of course each will he to sign I to office using their 365 credentials once they sign in under their domain account. 
 Am I missing anything? Every so often this PC will not let anyone sign into the Office apps and say the product is unlicensed. They all have Apps for Enterprise and Business Basic licenses.

 A developer has other needs than a knowledge worker and may need a workstation with less restrictions. I think about applocker rules etc and other security related restrictions.

                              <span>I am to send a weekly progress report on things I&#x27;ve done every Monday. However, I feel almost embarrassed to put down only one or two things on that report and don&#x27;t want them to feel like I&#x27;m doing nothing because I am working but what I&#x27;m doing takes forever. I&#x27;m trying to create onboarding and offboarding procedures (that keep changing all the time due to changes we are currently making to our system). I am trying to learn some code and create a database and other applications, which I&#x27;m sure you all know takes time too. So when my report is due, it literally has like 3-4 things on it. I also put out all the small fires or things employees need throughout the week too. Any suggestion how I can make this thing look more productive?

 I noticed a weird problem and can´t figure out how to solve it.
 We use Exchange 2016 On-Prem and this problem is only affecting this employee, no one else.
 I setup a laptop for her because she was switching to home-office for a few weeks and as soon as i wanted to start and setup outlook i got hit with an error message saying: &quot;Outlook can´t be opened&quot;. I waited a few seconds and outlook did start but it wouldn´t load any mails.
 Any Help is appreciated

As far as I know user have been using to login to PC with Microsoft account and decided to make local account, I think they tried migration because there is only local account visible at login screen. After restart login failed with message &quot;the user profile service service failed the sign-in. User is not the biggest deal but bitlocker. In order to fix User profile there is a ways to do so like using Regedit and I have done it in the past, but I can&#x27;t get to recovery CMD or safe mode because of bitlocker asking to enter key to unlock the drive. Plus, recovery key is not present in Microsoft account. Does any solution exist for this?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have a situation where we&#x27;re moving people across to azure only managed devices and that means their accounts don&#x27;t need to be domain joined anymore, as the only thing requiring domain authentication was the old domain joined computer log in screen.
 Initially we were moving the accounts to an unsynced organisational unit and then re-enabling the deleted accounts in azure to break the link, but we found that this had the side effect of removing their private channels on teams due to teams channels not being managed via an assigned group.
 Is there any way to pause adsync, move the on-prem account to the disabled OU, then just set the accounts on-prem sync to false on an individual account basis?

                              <span>Hello, as per the title, I have a general question about a server choice for the company I work for. We are looking at 10 users, in a windows environment with heavy use of google services. 
 This is the configuration I have in mind, https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/dell-servers-storage-networking/smart-selection-poweredge-t440-tower-server-plus/spd/poweredge-t440/pet4402a?configurationid&#x3D;78d39809-61c4-43c5-88aa-9b9fa758a475
 It will act as a print server, backup storage for less relevant data, and for some automation for our database.
 Any recommendations, or comments? I&#x27;d appreciate the advice.

                              <span>Hi Reddit, hoping you guys&amp;gals can help me.
 I&#x27;m trying to find a download of Exchange 2007 to install the management tools so we can powershell and export users to psts, but i can&#x27;t for the life of me find a download for it. Can anyone help?
 I&#x27;ve looked at bittitan as a alternative to move the users onto 365 but users budget is 0...
 All help is much appreciated!

                              <span>In our setup, we have an RDS farm running Server 2022 which is pretty heavily used. Quite often, outlook.exe, excel.exe or some other program, will end up in the IFEO key (Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options) with debug options preventing that program from starting entirely.
 I&#x27;ve yet to find any way of preventing those keys to be created, my google-fu must not be up to scratch.
 It&#x27;s only really started being an issue within the last couple of months. It happens on workstations running Windows 10 21H2 too, though rarely.
 Has anyone else had this issue? Maybe even solved it?

                              <span>Hello !
 ​
 First of all, sorry if i make gramatical/technical mistakes, English is not my first language.
 So, recently, my company started to use Azure AD for using Office 365 with a federated Domain. We set a SSO with Shibboleth linked to our main domain. Then, if a user try to connect to the domain, it redirect them on the CAS page, and if they&#x27;re already connected, allow the authentication. This was done with our network engineers, actually in charge of the OpenLDAP (one of the domain is on Samba 4 and the other only have and LDAP and no samba)
 ​
 Since then, we though of some amelioration and I was trying to log in windows with work account (so an account present in the azure A.D). It works for the account in managed domain, but doesn&#x27;t for the federated domain.
 ​
 I know it&#x27;s logical since the Windows authentication can&#x27;t redirect them to our CAS, but I read online that some people can login with federated domain username and password. My question is, how ?
 ​
 I believe the main mistake was during the first implementation of the SSO with the command Set-MsolDomainAuthentication. We used the command as :
 Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName $OurDomain -federationBrandName $FederationBrandName -LogOffUri $LogoutUrl -Authentication Federated -PassiveLogOnUri $LogonURI -SigningCertificate $certData -IssuerUri $uuri -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol SAMLP 
 We didn&#x27;t use &quot;ActiveLogonUri&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is usefull, nor really sure about what that property can do. Still, this command work for the web-based applications but obviously not for Windows authentication 
 Is this the problem or am I completly out of place ? Do you have any idea about the origin, or a solution ?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Have a quick question regarding the above. 
 We have SPF enabled for just spf.protection.outlook.com and that’s sufficient enough I believe. So only things sent from M365 will allow outbound mail. 
 DKIM is setup via DNS and our 365 admin centre. And this seems fine. 
 But here’s where I’m a bit confused. We have dmarc enabled and it was set to quarantine. So all mail that fails SPF and DKIM will go into spam? Is this for inbound or outbound mail? I thought DMARC was for outbound, but a 3rd party trying to email us, got an error showing DNS Auth: DMARC failed.
 Is this an issue on our end?
 Tia

I’m weeks now trying not just to get the base functionality working but even to get consistent behaviour on the few endpoints in our pilot. I’ve a few contacts that ran the compliance features in their own shops and their experience of it was not encouraging. 
 Has anyone here seen MS DLP working in action ?

 I am planning to replace existing hostname by making simple interactive script
 #!/bin/bash echo &quot;Set Hostname&quot; read name1 name&#x3D;&#x27;cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname&#x27; sed -i &#x27;s/$name/$name1/g&#x27; /etc/hostname hostname $name1 
 The issue here is - it changes hostname after I set input after script run. I exit and log back in. I see new hostname. But nothing gets changed in /etc/hostname file. reboot and I am back to old hostname.
 What am I missing here?

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 TLDR; Does SMS store failed files/directories in its logs?
 Having completed an inventory scan I&#x27;ve got around 300 failed folders which i can&#x27;t seem to find any reference for in the logs (obtained using the StorageMigrationServiceHelper PowerShell Module)
 I&#x27;ve tried using AccessEnum to query folders i don&#x27;t have permissions to and it comes back with Access being in place except 1 file. It also seems to only return a small fraction of items with the default or &#x27;display only files that have permissions less restrictive than parent&#x27; on
 Have ran various PowerShell scripts to query access also and around 100 items are path too long etc but this still doesn&#x27;t match the number of failed folders on D and G drives.
 Seems like i&#x27;ll end up migrating whats been inventoried so that it gets the bulk over and creates the shares (won&#x27;t be using the cutover) and then likely Robocopy the rest but id obviously rather have the SMS takes care of things for me.
 ​
 Any advice/ insights would be appreciated :)
 ​
 Cheers

                              <span>hey everyone, want to run a hypothetical. Let’s say we have a hybrid 365 with onprem dc and exchange, As we may know, we cannot decommission on prem exchange after mailbox migration is finished as on prem exchange manages some of the attributes of user mailboxes.
 Would it be a problem if you you disabled user sync and went cloud only, decommissioned exchange, removed AD attributes, then setup user sync again?

                              <span>Yesterday I discovered that 463 of the 1801 Dutch government domains are unnecessarily vulnerable to code injection and XSS attacks due to the use of static &#x60;nonces&#x60; in the Content-Security-Policy. A &#x60;nonce&#x60; should not be guessable and should be generated randomly on every request. The official documentation is clear on this: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-nonces.
 I have reported to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), and they confirm the incorrect implementation but do not consider it a security problem. &quot;We will, therefore, not process your report further,&quot; said an anonymous employee. In addition, I was still imposed that I may not disclose which domains are involved.
 I stumbled upon this problem by chance and selflessly took the trouble to map out the scope of the problem and report it properly. I am not in this for a bounty or anything; I just wanted to help out.
 It is disappointing to see that the Dutch government cannot implement basic security measures according to specifications to protect visitors against malicious parties. This was an absolute waste of my time.

 We have implemented Yubikeys as a 2FA method for Windows Login. I have noticed that outlook wants me to enter my yubikey pin, but it doesn’t work and it asks over and over again. Is there anything i can do about that? Thanks in Advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working in a monitoring center where we monitor thousands of customer servers based on alarm tickets. Now we have a project where we want to get some statistics about how our center is doing. Basically we want to have some metrics to show to higher-ups if needed. We already have work hours counted based on each ticket we work on. We use ServiceNow as our ticketing system.
 I&#x27;m now asking for any suggestions on some concrete metrics that we could monitor or just any ideas for performance monitoring.
 Luckily our boss is really cool about this process and we can define all the metrics and what is a successful day/week/month ourselves.

 Because at the moment, the way we keep track of laptops is an Excel workbook that I have NOW scripted to find duplicates automatically. Before I started the only tool was an Excel workbook without any checks. So completely manual all the way.
 Obviously super inefficient and unsafe, the thing is. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a better solution.
 What do you guys use to keep track of employee laptops?

                              <span>Hey all. Struggling to work out how to troubleshoot this.
 The environment:
 FreeBSD 12.1 on VMware
 Apache 2.4
 MySQL 5.7.31
 Best Practical RT5 5.0.0 (our ticket system)
 The issue:
 Has been running fine for years. Abruptly, Monday morning, apache started consuming 100% CPU and using all available swap. httpd-error.log is full of
 [warning]: Use of uninitialized value $tag in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/HTML/Formatter.pm line 150. (/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/HTML/Formatter.pm:150) 
 ...thousands of them.
 /var/log/messages is likewise full of the slightly more helpful
  Use of uninitialized value $tag in string eq at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/HTML/Element.pm line 2634. 
 If I stop and restart apache, all goes back to normal for a few minutes, and then starts again.
 I&#x27;ve spend days googling all sorts of thiings but haven&#x27;t found anything useful yet. Anyone able to throw me a bone?
 Thanks,
 Adam

 Newer is not always better, and I havn‘t really worked with Server 2022 in points of reliability and stability.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a client (well, several) in a relatively small industry, but there&#x27;s a very large player who needs to communicate with them via email.
 ​
 Throughout the year we&#x27;ve been progressively working on improving email hygiene for our clients, this includes add SPF failure (hard-fail and hard-error) quarantining in the email security platform. 
 ​
 the big player has reached out to our client several times, saying we&#x27;re blocking their email. I&#x27;ve tried to reach back, to find the right person, people or team in in the organisation and asked the few contacts I actually have to help me find the wrong person. Their response is &quot;none of our other clients are reporting this problem, you just need to white list us.&quot;
 ​
 Here&#x27;s the thing. They have two SPF records, which fails just on that alone. they have no DKIM keys. They have DMARC configured using proofpoint, but basically acheiving nothing (p&#x3D;none). 
 My response is, well, they need to fix their shit. They created these SPF records, someone must be responsible for it. For us to just white list them (considering the industry) is, imo, the wrong decision to make because it then opens up our client to the risk of receiving fake and/or malicious emails from this sender. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve communicated with my client serveral times about the issue. So far they haven&#x27;t explicitly (or otherwise) told me to white list it and I know they trust my judgement.
 ​
 So, Am I the Asshole here, for trying to protect my client (and, I suppose the sender, who is ASX50) and trying to refer it back to them to fix their problem?

                              <span>Just curious what people here use for monitoring Data Centers and associated equipment. 
 I am looking to explore alternatives for rack diagrams, pdu monitoring, pdu cable tracking and temperature monitoring via RFID, maybe some more alarming. 
 I&#x27;ve looked at various options out there, but many seem to be over kill, way too expensive or a pain in the ass to run, which means people avoid it.
 Currently using Visual Data Center.

                              <span>Seems like a lot of jobs are asking for your usual route/switch/firewall as well as some AWS skills. I&#x27;m brand new to AWS.
 It&#x27;s confusing to understand what learning path, or resource to start with? I have an INE subscription for learning, if anyone knows of a good AWS course on INE.

                              <span>Reviewing the IP header fields I&#x27;m wondering if anyone could shed some light on why the IP version field is 4 bits long if there are only two options: IPv4 / IPv6. This information could be represented as a 1 bit value instead, freeing up 3 bits from every packet traversing the internet. Is there a reason IPv6 did not change this field to be shorter? It seems like freeing up 3 bits of data from this field would yield global improvements in internet efficiency.
 Now look, I realize that there&#x27;s always smarter people who have thought of something first. So I understand there are likely good reasons for this ineffienct header value. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone could tell me why things are set up the way they are.

 Is netbox free ? Would it work in a large enterprise environment? Does netbox have support ? Is there a sale rep that I can communicate with ? 
 I tried googling but not much information out there regarding netbox. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I recently took on a new job as a systems engineer, tasked with discovery and replacing equipment in a 1600 person company, across 60 locations, (6 main locations). One of the locations has three Dell N2000 stacks in different parts of the building. I&#x27;m not too savvy with switches, or VLANs for that matter, but I&#x27;m learning. I&#x27;m understanding these concepts more and more every day and how they&#x27;re applied to this network. I&#x27;m currently doing discovery on this building, but I have no GUI/Web interface to log into for two of the three stacks.
 The MDF has no issues. I&#x27;m able to log into that via IP address no problem.
 I&#x27;m having issues getting into the other IDF stacks. I&#x27;m able to putty into them using SSH no problem. Credentials take which is a great sign. But I&#x27;m still very green to all of this here, and looking at everything visually is way easier for me then CLI, especially when I&#x27;m trying to map out these VLANS and trunked ports, etc.
 Is there anything I need to do to get onto these other stack&#x27;s GUI? I&#x27;m confused as to why just one stack is accessible through GUI, and the others are not.
 Looking for some help on this or pointers! What am I missing here!

                              <span>I have a client who is requesting we upgrade one of their LAN ports to 2.5g. They have an Unifi switch with an available sfp+ port capable of 10G. They have another switch which they purchased that has an SFP (non +) port capable of up to 2.5G. 
 I have tried using an SFP cable to hook the two up, and two different SFP+ cables, one copper, one fiber. With all the cables, I tried port speed auto-negotiation and manually setting it to 2.5g, but the unifi switch cannot detect this 2.5g switch. Any way to link an SFP to an SFP+ port?

These are the model number of android devices and I have several on my network. A typical capture will show (1) the name and mac address of the sender, (2) the Sender Ip address, (3) The Target MAC address as all zeros, and (4) the target IP address as a different IP but the same name. 
 We are not experiencing any new issues but I do not know how long this has been going on. Is it something I should be concerned about?

I have seen this happen twice in large public companies.

                              <span>I seem to be getting conflicting information on how the IPsec protocol itself handles multiple subnets in a tunnel. I know different vendors have slightly different approaches to this, but I&#x27;m more concerned with what&#x27;s actually possible in the protocol. I&#x27;ve heard the following so far:
  
Multiple subnets are agreed upon in phase 2, all in a single tunnel.
 Multiple phase 2 &quot;tunnels&quot; are created, one for each subnet pair.
 You can&#x27;t do more than one subnet pair in the IPsec protocol. Therefore, multiple phase 1 tunnels are created, one for each subnet pair.
  
I think the 2nd answer is correct, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any detailed information from an authority on it without diving deep into the RFC&#x27;s.
 FWIW, I know it&#x27;s possible to just make a big 0.0.0.0/0 tunnel and deal with the routing myself, but I&#x27;m trying to help a vendor troubleshoot their own stuff on a failover tunnel between us and them. The status on my side shows that in a failover event, only one of the subnet pairs is re-created.
 Edit: I&#x27;m now leaning towards the 1st answer because of the below link. It seems that you can have multiple traffic selectors. Some vendors just &quot;show&quot; this information as multiple phase 2 tunnels? But their terminology isn&#x27;t necessarily accurate, and everything was only negotiated once in phase 2?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m currently trying to help our subsidiary company with installing a new Cisco Meraki firewall.
 Up until this point they have had little to no security built into their firewall. Their old one was basically an allow all rule that configures the firewall like a router. I&#x27;ve told them multiple times this is not acceptable. 
 Long story short I configured the firewall for them, but it did cause some things to break. (I don&#x27;t actually work in their environment so its hard for me to know everything that goes on) 
 Their environment is somewhat complex as they have multiple vpns belonging to clients. Also obviously clients don&#x27;t give out all the security details of their programs so its been tough sledding to this point.
 My question is is what would you do if you were in my shoes? Is it not possible to block a lot of ports due to the size of the company? I&#x27;ve only worked at smaller companies so blocking multiple ports has never been an issue.
 I&#x27;ve read about doing network scans for 24 hours and then analyzing this data. The problem is at this point it is hard to differentiate friend from foe as everything is being let in.
 Any advice or anything really would be of major help.
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am having an issue with static IP&#x27;s and configuring protection against ARP spoofing on a pretty basic switch ( HPE 1920-48G-PoE+). This switch refers to it as ARP Anti-Attack which is where I configured my trusted ports to other switches and configured it to be enabled on VLAN 1. I have already configured DHCP snooping and everything works as expected as long as a device is using DHCP.
 Now, my issue is with some devices that are using a static IP addresses outside of the DHCP range. My understanding is I should be able to add a static ARP entry in the table for the IP and mac address but for whatever reason it still does not work.
 So my question is:
  
What is the proper way to deal with static IP&#x27;s when enabling ARP Spoofing? I know I can use DHCP reservations but I want to know how to handle this without DHCP.
 If putting static entries in the ARP table is the solution to handling static IPs, what could be causing my issue with this switch?

                              <span>I was recently interested in cg-nat and decided to check whether my ISP of mobile data uses it or not. I discovered that the cg-nat has a range of IPv4 addresses allocated to it(100.64.0.0/10). Ip checking websites showed me having a public ip address, which is typical for cg-nat, however in the phone settings i had a public ip address in the range of 10.0.0.0/8. From my understanding my ISP is indeed using cg-nat, but why is my private IP address not in the scope of addresses allocated for cg-nat? Am I missing something?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been self-learning computer networking and I&#x27;m nearing the end of the well-known book Computer Networking by Kurose--Ross. (It&#x27;s been a joy.) The book takes a top-down approach through the protocol stack, but it does not really deal with the physical layer. In fact, as it finishes up the link layer, the book explicitly states:
  
Certainly, the physical layer lies below the link layer, but the details of the physical layer are probably best left for another course (for example, in communication theory, rather than computer networking).
  
I&#x27;d be interested in knowing more. Does anyone have any reference recommendations to continue my journey?

                              <span>Question
 I have EVE NG setup and it&#x27;s working well. My lab environment looks like so 
  
VMWARE Workstation - EVE NG (Bridged Mode)
 EVE NG Configured Working on my local network (192.168.0.228)
 Windows 10 workstation (eve ng) 10.1.10.25 (dhcp from switch) Port 1 Cisco Switch
 Cisco Switch (eve ng) 10.1.10.2 and gateway set to 10.1.10.3
 Fortinet VM Firewall (eve ng) (port 0 on cisco) 
 Fortinet VM Firewall Port 2 10.1.10.3 internal to cisco switch port zero
  
​
 So I can connect from the windows machine to the firewall however, Im not sure exactly how to get out to the internet.

                              <span>Ill start by saying that I am do not have my CCNA. Actually, I don&#x27;t have much experience with Cisco at all.
 Im an IT guy for a small company. The current Cisco 3850 switch is severely outdated and we just purchased a new 9300.
 Since I dont have a lot of Cisco experience, I was using the 9300 to go over some CCNA labs before installing this in production. I made some errors and ended up factory resetting the switch.
 Now, Im getting bootable url&#x27;s in boot variable not found or exhausted
 please check the rommon configuration or boot command usage.
 ​
 I downloaded the image from Cisco&#x27;s site, installed and can get back into the webui and run commands and everything seems fine, until I reboot the switch. After rebooting, it get the &quot;bootable url in boot variable not found&quot; message again.I made sure to save my configuration settings before restarting.
 Ive been Googling this for a day and its driving me insane, but Im sure its something stupid that Im missing.
 Any help would be very greatly appreciated!
 ​
 ​
 Edit: If I boot from the USB drive with the image on it, I am able to get to all of my settings. I can take the USB out and get to my webui and all my configurations appear to be there, but if I dont reboot it with the USB, then I get the &quot;bootable url&quot; error.
 It almost seems like maybe the image isnt saved to the switch
 ​

 Edit 2: RESOLVED. Resolution in comments!

                              <span>Hello all,
 Im trying to understand what the difference is between the Cisco ASA vs FPR vs FTD. 
 When reading documentation, ASA is replaced by the NGFW: Firepower. The ASA lacked for example IPS and had a basic software. The FPR can now provide URL filtering, application control etc.. 
 But.. how is the FPR managed compared to the ASA? Do you managed it via CLI or GUI (or both)? What more differences are there between these two more than the above stated? I also read about the FTD, what does this exactly do? It seems to me that FTD is a software, but what does it run on?
 I probably mix all of these but I would like some clarification.

                              <span>For those that have their Webex traffic going through a proxy:
 Do you use a normal TCP Proxy?
 We currently do and experience sound/video quality problems that are bad enough to annoy the users.
 As we would rather like to continue to have all internet traffic go through a proxy we consider trying a SOCKS proxy. So, does anyone have experience with Webex through a SOCKS proxy? Does it help to mitigate latency problems?
 If yes, how do you redirect the UDP data stream to the SOCKS proxy? We use PAC scripts to redirect traffic depending on URL but that doesn&#x27;t help to sort the UDP and TCP traffic to their respective proxy.

                              <span>I need to somehow force SFP port UP on Cisco 2960x when only RX is connected. 
 Reason for this is that we are using TAP, which outputs TX/TX. Each of the TX are connected to their own separated GBIC on the Cisco 2960x. TX port on the gbic stays unplugged. This setup works on older Cisco 2960g, and port comes up even with the TX port unplugged. However, on Cisco 2960x it doesnt work and port doesnt come up.
 Is there some configuration option to setup sfp port to go up when only RX is connected?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m making a small setup for a secondary building on the lowest budget possible but to be able to handle about 100 clients (worst case scenario) on one access point. I&#x27;m not gonna get a console like a dream machine because it&#x27;s not worth it for this setup. 
 I was thinking of using just two AC or U6 pro APs in &quot;standalone mode&quot; and connecting them to a router &amp; switch I already have. Pretty much a &quot;dumb access point&quot;
 Is it worth it to get Unifi access points for this or are there cheaper alternatives that would do the same (since you do pay a premium to have everything &quot;just work&quot; with ubiquity&quot; Any suggestions are appreciated!

                              <span>See title. I&#x27;m looking for a ping monitoring tool (any recommandations ? optionnally would be cool if it could monitor disconnections too) and, sorry for the stupid question, but if it&#x27;s constantly pinging to check that data, will it affect my speed/ping ingame?

                              <span>(Posted this over at /r/aws but it got flagged for moderation, so giving it a shot here). 
 I&#x27;ve worked for 5 years in AWS/devops/etc. in large companies where this was already established and we had an on-premise network, so we had the full bells and whistles of Direct Connect.
 Now I&#x27;ve joined a startup and we&#x27;re setting up our own AWS environment, and establishing private connectivity from scratch is uncharted ground for me. As a startup, we are essentially all &quot;floating&quot; right now --- we don&#x27;t have a dedicated office with a dedicated network range, or any sort of on-premise presence.
 But, we need a way to access EC2, RDS, etc. without public IP addresses (and preferably without a publicly exposed bastion/jumpbox to get there). We don&#x27;t have anything massively critical, and we will grow, so by the time we do, we can revisit this to really flesh out a sturdy solution. But right now I just need some basic items I can go through to ensure only our people can access our AWS resources.
 For VPN options that aren&#x27;t site-to-site, &quot;Client VPN&quot; seems like an option: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-client-vpn-to-securely-access-aws-and-on-premises-resources/
 If someone can just tell me if I&#x27;m warm or cold on this, and point me in the direction of the necessary service/tool that I need, that would be great. Thanks!

                              <span>We are physically separating our distribution nodes and having to put in two L3 devices between them for encryption reasons. I’m trying to explain to my coworkers that if we do that HSRP will not work due to the switches not being able to directly see each other (there now being two hops to get to the other). I’ve tried setting something up in a lab of course I didn’t get it to work but I wanted to get y’all’s input on a better explanation on why this wouldn’t work OR if it can work and I’m just missing something.

                              <span>Assuming you have a SoT like Netbox and some device discovery software like solarwinds. I&#x27;m always confused which one should be the entry point for device on-boarding?
 Add device to Solarwinds and then Solarwinds populates Netbox with all device information?
 OR
 Populate the device in Netbox and then it adds the device to Solarwinds
 The issue here is circular dependency, Netbox should be the ultimate SoT meaning it dictates the intent whether to have the device in the network in the first place or not, how the interfaces should look like, IP addresses etc.., so in a sense, it must be the entry point. but at the same the device needs to be populated first to see that are the interfaces, IPs etc.
 in a sense both should be diff&#x27;ed to see the actual vs intended and point out if there&#x27;s a deviation, but i&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the best approach to start integrating both. any thoughts?

                              <span>My friend just told me he was checking out PortMaster, which I wasn&#x27;t familiar with. I took a brief glance at their page and some of Safing&#x27;s documentation (which I believe sounds like an extra service on top of the open source portmaster), and I&#x27;m trying to understand -
 Is this essentially application filtering, but on a local firewall as opposed to a network device? 
 I understand portmaster itself is open source and very configurable and safing has some extra services they&#x27;ve built that portmaster can leverage, but ignoring all that portmaster is more or less a software firewall kind of like pfsense, just for your local machine?

                              <span>What are you guys using as CPEs for consumer FTTH Active Ethernet networks?
 Our current vendors are having supply chain issues, so I&#x27;m open to other options. 
 Cost is a bit of an issue, as the consumer ARPU isn&#x27;t that high. 1G is fine, 10G is lovely, but not at any price. Must have either SFP or BiDi optics.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having an issue with the sponsored guest portal on ISE I&#x27;ve set up for our Guest wireless.
 I&#x27;ve setup everything, so, policy sets (and everything that goes with it), Meraki SSID side of things and a Guest Portal, Guest Type, Sponsor Portal and a Sponsor Group.
 When a user logs in they get redirected to the Guest Portal, where they are given the chance to register and then from there they register fine, an approval email goes out, as well as me seeing the account created on the Sponsor Portal to, I approve the account. I can see the username/pw etc... but when the user tries to login with the creds, it fails with an Authentication Failed error.
 The guests are registering their devices in the GuestEndPoints internal store (but not showing up in there)
 In the logs I can see the users request actually pass and being permitted also (so it passes the check on the GuestEndPoints store to, I think because this laptop has already logged in tbf on the network many times prior to this)
 But for whatever reason I cannot get the user to login.
 I have 2 authorisation policies in the policy set to, the second one matches on the wireless type (wireless MAB) which is what shows up in the logs, the first in the chain is a policy that matches on the wireless authentication type again (wireless MAB) but also the Radius Case being &quot;Guest Flow&quot; also, with the VLAN authorisation profile I want to give the guest. I assumed this is done via somekind of CoA on ISE after the user is approved, but this policy never shows up in the logs and is never hit

We will be expanding aci to our secondary dc via multipod and spine tk spine implementation. That one will also have a layer 3 out to its corresponding core router/switch I’ll add a diagram soon. ? Is how can I redistribute static routes into the aci’s fabrics eigrp,(cores run eigrp too) but we have some static’s for x reasons? The core routers are connected to each other via L3/l2 I was going to try to configure the L3 outs just like any other dual multihomed connections and just weigh them or keep them balanced. Feel free to flame but while I research wanted to see what other net peeps thought.

                              <span>Good afternoon,
 I have a question for the folks who work in big ISPs who perform CGNAT and PBA for customers. 
 What happens when a customer requires a new port block to be allocated, and the current IP they have the port block for has all ports exhausted? Theoretically, whatever devices should try to free up port blocks for that IP, but if it can&#x27;t, I assume the user gets a different port block on a different public IP. Now the user has 1 port block on one IP and another port block on a different IP. 
 I can imagine how this would impact various applications, but would like someone who runs this in a large production environment to shed some light on this.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a very simple playbook to use cisco.iosxr.iosxr_command from the galaxy collection for iosxr to push some raw config commands.
 It works against the ASR9k platform, but not against an NCS540 with no changes to code or connect method or any of the host/group vars compared to what I&#x27;m doing for the ASR chassis.
 The error isn&#x27;t specific to a config not being liked, but rather it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s failing to connect (I&#x27;ve tried with AAA in place and using local creds only even though there&#x27;s no login specific error).
 ​
 The error I&#x27;m getting is &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;[Errno -2] Name or service not known&quot; when it goes to run the first task. the full verbose traceback which states it may not be related to the actual failure only references 2 things.... some iosxr.py file from the collection itself, line 179 get_capabilities.... capabilities &#x3D; Connection(module._socket_path).get_capabilities() and a reference to a connection.py file in ansible module_utils line 200 in __rpc__ raise ConnectionError(to_text(msg, errors&#x3D;&#x27;surrogate_then_replace&#x27;), code&#x3D;code) followed by my task that just sends configure terminal and some simple logging commands.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve confirmed all of the commands work fine on the NCS platform. The error is the same regardless of if I use any other iosxr method like for banners or logging which is why I tried switching to iosxr_command to rule out any weirdness but it&#x27;s still there and only when pushing to the NCS540.
 I&#x27;m using network_cli for the connection and iosxr for the network_os in the group_vars vars file for this platform, same as the ASR.
 ​
 Any ideas? Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Hello engineers!
 I have user and guest SSIDs running through two ISE nodes.
 All ok if the work of the ISE is done by the &quot;master&quot; node, instead it doesn&#x27;t work if the ISE on the track is the &quot;slave&quot;.
 This causes it to have no HA, which is very strange since the fixtures are synchronized.
 What do you think? Where can I make sure they are actually in sync and back up each other?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Not a network expert by any means so would like some insight or direction as to whether this is an issue or I&#x27;m barking up the wrong tree etc.
 Our client uses this ZScaler App to route all traffic to a UK range they host.
 Example IP would be: 165.225.16.240
 IF I ping this IP there is some loss of packets, ranges between 2-5%. If I ping Google there is no packet loss.
 When I do a traceroute there is always packet loss at the Zayo hop:
 Tracing route to 165.225.17.15 over a maximum of 30 hops:
 1 1 ms &lt;1 ms &lt;1 ms 192.168.99.1
 2 23 ms 32 ms 1 ms 62......
 (Exits Network Gateway)
 3 1 ms 1 ms 1 ms 212......
 4 6 ms 4 ms 2 ms 62.........
 5 8 ms 2 ms 7 ms ge-3-3-0.mpr1.lhr3.uk.above.net [195.66.236.76]
 6 3 ms \ ** ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com [64.125.24.210]
 7 \ * * Request timed out.*
 8 8 ms 6 ms 9 ms 94.31.30.187.IPYX-069051-042-ZYO.zip.zayo.com [94.31.30.187]
 9 4 ms 4 ms 10 ms 165.225.17.15
 Another reading.. before it reaches the ZScaler service:
 Host Longitude Latitude Location Name Packet Sent Packet Received Loss
 ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 80 73.333336
 ae12.mpr3.lhr8.uk.zip.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 252 16
 ZScaler confirmed nothing to do with them, a third party ISP. So am I looking to engage with our ISP about this you reckon?
 Or am I just barking up the wrong tree and this is nothing to be worried about?
 The client say they are being disconnected random times.. when I check the on-site MX i cant see any issues with latency or packet loss etc.. no downtime of any sort.. i can only think the zscaler service is going down and maybe confusing the clients network adapter switching from zscaler back to lan etc..
 Anyway can someone let me know if this Zayo route is a ISP issue or ZScaler.
 Cheers.

                              <span>Working with a school that has a lot of old iMacs where many of them are accessing with 100mbps FE.
 We have 10 48port switches
 The rack was punched down to spread the wireless access points, phones, and currently unused ports across the switches for power budget and to keep all the eggs out of one basket.
 The budget for new computers didn&#x27;t go through so we have at least the rest of the school year.
 Does having all these slow devices hinder the other items in the switch? What about some of the 10mbps Devices like access control, intercom links, and VOIP phones?
 Would it be better to put all the 100mbps Macs on one switch where they can be in the slow lane on their own?

 We&#x27;re running DNAC and from its reporting section I can pull a list of switches that have port utilisation of over 50%,over 75% &amp; over 90%. What I&#x27;m trying to do is just get a list of every switch I have in DNAC along with its current port utilisation. A lot of our switches are under-utilised and I want to identify them. 
 Any ideas? Thanks.

 I want to be able to monitor the status of the devices, update files and start some actions on the devices. 
 Essentially I need some network-wide remote access to the devices.
 Any ideas how can this be achieved ? or what type of network should I look for ? Is there something similar I can get inspiration from ?
 The network should be able to endure high bandwidth of data exchange (20-300MBs).

                              <span>I understand you need to configure the links on each member.
 i.e.
 Switch 1 vsf member 1 link 1 1/51 vsf member 1 link 2 1/52 Switch 2 vsf member 2 link 1 52 vsf member 2 link 2 51 
 Question is does &quot;link 1&quot; (port 51) on switch one need to plug into what I have designated &quot;link 1&quot; (port 52) on the second switch or are the link numbers arbitrary?

                              <span>My saga on making the DHCP relay work still goes on.
 (My first post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u71pdr/problems_with_dhcp_relay/)
 ​
 Now I have a lightly different infrastructure, with a (little) more straight approach. At least that&#x27;s how I see it.
 ​
 I have my main DHCP server running as a Hyper-V VM, connected to our network. On this DHCP server, I have the scopes 192.168.93.0/24 and 192.168.103.0/24 (from .10 to .100).
 ​
 Running in other Hyper-V I have another Windows VM for this test. This computer has its own Virtual Switch.
 ​
 On my Cisco CBS350, I have VLAN1 and VLAN103.
 My DHCP server is connected to a trunk port. Its IP is 192.168.93.2.
 My test client is connected to an access port, that is part of VLAN103.
 The VLAN103 has a fixed IP, 192.168.103…</span>

I honestly just have no more patience for the cake and eat it too leadership bullshit with budgets. Users. Printers. Exec hires that can plug in their tv for superbowl but cannot connect there monitors after moving desks. I need a hobby outside of tech or a permanent vacation. 10 plus years in the biz im am over it all. 
 Oh and &quot;you work in IT?&quot; from friends and family yeah no. 185 per hour. To expensive? ok google is i guess since you stated thats all i do anyway. 
 What has happened to base level problem solving skills is our society that diluted?

                              <span>Well guys Ive got a question I need some insight on. After working as a sysadmin at a company for 17 years I was let go today.
 My manager says I was let go for having issues one too many times. And I have made mistakes. Ive tried to correct those and move one. The straw that broke the camels back was when a script Ive run for years to reset system account passwords went sideways and accidentally locked out like 50 service accounts. 
 But Im about a decade away from retirement and I was burned out there. Over the years management has expected more and more out of my team and I admit as I gotten older Ive had more and more trouble staying sharp and motivated.
 If I stay in IT how do I spin &quot;hey Im 50+, and got burned out at my old job&quot;?
 Im even thinking I may not want to stay in IT. What do you guys think?

                              <span>About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially &quot;good with computers&quot; set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn&#x27;t super unusual.
 But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn&#x27;t have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn&#x27;t anything that would fit our needs.
 Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and &quot;nothing is going to happen, you worry too much&quot;
 So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn&#x27;t make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn&#x27;t want to pay for it.
 And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. 
 So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said &quot;I quit,&quot; I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job. Disaster recovery plan worked exactly how I planned.

 Xerox Universal Printer driver renames my shared printers after gpo drops them.
 It deploys as HR-Xerox printer and a moment after is over written with name &quot;Xerox AltaLink C8030/c8035. What is even more odd is when you go to actually print from say notepad it shows the proper share name?

                              <span>So last week I received a Teams message from a senior person in HR that they needed to talk to me and wanted to know if my calendar was updated. I quickly responded that it was and went about my business. I then received a meeting request show up in my email box. It included HR VP, Legal, Recruiting and the CFO.
 Initially I didn&#x27;t think about it because I was busy. Then as I slowed down and thought about it and all weekend I freaked myself out about it. Why was HR calling me and why was legal included.
 I sheepishly walked into HR office today not knowing what to expect. As it turns out they want to replace the applicant tracking system and needed my support.
 I relayed my angst to the HR folks before the meeting got going. They thought it was funny and laughed it off about a guilty conscience. 
 How many ways can an IT guy mess up and not even know it? HR Should be more thorough in their communications.

 Re-terminated both ends twice to make sure.
 So cable test is showing Orange: 110ft, Green: 122ft, Blue: 122ft, Brown: 122ft. when done from either end. But all pairs mark as good.
 Getting no link or connection on it either, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s even working.

 We’re on the ‘Pro’ plan, so we have to do a special request from Slackcorp for both company’s data (private channels and messages). 
 Just curious what everyone’s experience has been in this situation. Thanks!

                              <span>Really?! Admin docs Pearson VUE must be installed and run as local administrator?
  
&quot;Any Windows user account that interacts with the VTS software on
 the Administration, Proctor, or exam delivery workstation is required
 to have local administrator rights on that workstation. This includes both
 installing and running the VTS software.&quot;
  
Killing a fly with a sledgehammer much?
 I can use ProcMon to try to find what permissions are actually needed, but maybe some kind soul can save me the hassle?

                              <span>I have an enclosed half rack at a datacenter. It&#x27;s an older rack where it doesn&#x27;t have mounting holes for 0U style things on the side. The two PDUs provided by the DC are horizontal and on the bottom of the rack and supply 208v power with c14 locking outlets. After a mix of multiple 1U/2U servers, routers, and switches that all have redundant power supplies I am both out of outlets and the bundle of power cables on the side is out of hand. I used some d ring but those also take up 1U since the server rails are the nice quick install ones from HP/Dell. The DC has suggested Y splitter cables which I would like to avoid as they seem a point of failure. I wanted to know how anyone has solved this in the past? Are there d-rings that work with server rails, is there some nice way to organize this that I don&#x27;t know?

                              <span>Anyone find a nice way to resign while stuck in the middle of several projects?
 I just accepted an offer with my old employer after getting fed up with poor corporate culture and being asked to handle too many tasks in the 11 months I have been with new job. I was going to walk from my new job almost immediately but I decided to keep working through my disdain for my current employer. It didn&#x27;t work out. I am burned out after less than a year. Now I have a heaping plate of projects that I am going to leave up for my Director of IT to deal with all by himself. I&#x27;m honestly terrified to hand in my letter of resignation I see it ending with getting screamed at by the IT Director followed by him having a stroke. The place I am at now needs a whole IT Department I carry all the Infrastructure Engineer, Network Engineer, Systems administration and Help Desk Duties for a $500M a year company.
 I would honestly just walk out if I didn&#x27;t live in such a small community. I would run into the people I fuck over pretty frequently if I did.
 ​
 UPDATE:
 Haha I haven&#x27;t drafted a resignation letter yet and just had 2 more projects dumped on me.

 Not sure what the point of this post is, I think I am just trying to get out some nervous energy. Can anyone else tell me what their second interview was like? I&#x27;ve never been on a second interview before - the questions I know how to answer, I answered in the first interview. No idea what to expect on this one.

 I have a virtual machine, that multiple users join via Remote Desktop, and they all use the same local user (MACHINENAME\USERNAME) so they all have the exact same everything everywhere including applications;
 Problem is that, being more than 5 users, they don&#x27;t really know when or if someone else is already connected to it, so they always kick out one each other without notice;
 Is there a way to prevent this? Could I limit the number of remote sessions or to &quot;lock&quot; it until someone disconnects? Or even just find a way for them to see if someone&#x27;s already using it?
 Thank you very much in advice, have a great day!

                              <span>Hi,
 So I have a Microsoft Surface Tablet that is going to be deployed in a public facing area. Essentially, it will be on a website with two options, the main one being to print a label that a user has been emailed. Clicking that button opens the camera and scans a QR code, once code has been read it will prompt the user to click a print label button where i&#x27;d like it to silently print said label to an attached label printer. The site is all working and tested fine.
 So i&#x27;ve created an intune profile for the browser, using Microsoft Kiosk Browser app rather than Edge so that it displays fullscreen with no navigation bars etc. There is an additional configuration profile setup to Force Allow the browser access to the camera. The first part works fine, However the print page takes me to an error page (the page works in normal edge so i know it works) the error shows:
 sorry that file type is unsupported blob:[mywebsiteaddress] 
 So i&#x27;m assuming that the Kiosk Browser app doesn&#x27;t support printing?.
 If i then change the browser in the configuration profile to MS Edge, printing will work fine, however, its not a full screen browser window and has navigation options, I still get the prompts to allow the camera, and I also get a print dialog screen which i really don&#x27;t want. 
 My questions are:
  
Can someone pin point where that first error might come from with regards to printing in the Kiosk Browser app
 If not, is there a way or an option that im missing to force edge into full screen mode and allow the camera access and disable the print screen.
  
The Kiosk Browser is the prefered option.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 This is going to be a long and detailed post and I am going to get into some specifics about my issues at my current workplace and a coworker that I&#x27;ve been battling with for a while now. Some pieces of information will be obfuscated for obvious reasons. At this point, I am not sure what else I can do anymore since I have done everything I possibly can. I&#x27;ve been working here for a few months, and it seems like it has not been working out ever since the very first month. Not sure what I can really do aside from leaving but let me know if anyone has any thoughts on this matter or if I&#x27;m being whiny.
 Ever since I joined the company a few months ago, I&#x27;ve had this coworker (let&#x27;s call him Bob) who is a senior sysadmin on the team that seems to be a very closed minded individual th…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked in my organization (which is part of a much bigger organization with LOTS of group policies and startup apps globally) for 20+ years so it all seems normal to me. But one of my (very tightly wrapped) users actually timed it today and reports it was 4 minutes and 48 seconds from turning on the power to being able to open an email this morning. How does that compare with what other folks see?
 There is an after work beer awaiting the results of this very unscientific poll.
 Edit: No roaming profiles. Laptop with an SSD. This is at the office not WFH.
 I won&#x27;t able to FIX this. The GPOs are set WAY above what I can modify. But tell me if this is stupid slow or typical in a corporate environment pretty please? 
 Also, you guys are great :-)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement a central access policy on a file share that will secure files that have not been classified by FCI from everyone but the owner/creator of the file. The issue is that with office files, a hidden lock file is created when an Office file (docs, xlsx, etc.) is opened by a user. This file contains the meta data for who has a file locked in case someone else on the network tries to open it. Since they are unable to access the file, a message states the file is locked by &quot;User&quot; instead of the actual user&#x27;s name.
 The only identifying features I can find for these files are the first 2 characters of the file name are always ~$ and that their file properties lists HSA as attributes.
 Is there already an AD attribute I can use for FCI that can reference either the first 2 characters of the file name HSA attribute of the file so I can allow read only access?

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;ve let my skillset get rusty lately. The last time I had my own lab I was using an old PC as a ESX host with a bunch of VMs on it. 
 My newish job has a bunch of technologies I&#x27;m not that familiar with. Ansible, kubernetes, docker.. it&#x27;s predominantly a Linux environment. I&#x27;m thinking of spinning up a lab that can somehow incorporate all these elements.
 How do you guys manage your own personal labs these days? Is it still best to get a physical server? I&#x27;m traveling around a lot so a cloud based solution would be ideal, unless I setup wake on LAN with a server or something. 
 I suppose if it&#x27;s a bunch of Linux VMs they&#x27;ll be fairly low resource requirements so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be too costly in the cloud.
 How do you guys manage your personal lab?

 I am trying to install windows server 2022 in a VM and setup up a domain for learning purposes.
 Now the first thing i do is set a static IP and change the computer name. i change the computer to DC01. When i am promoting the server to a domain controller and am at the stage to set the netBIOS name. I type in DC01 and i recieve the error that this name is already being used. Can the computer name not be the same as the NetBIOS name? I thought these shut be the same

 But the problem is now that we have 1 shares which is hidden and has a program on it which we have shortcut to on everyones desktop. 
 If you just right click on this icon you click on open file location then you can still go to the hidden network share which is blocked if you type in the adres in the file explorer how is this possible? 
 Is there GPO or something im missing? that prevents this? 
 I have found the option to remove open file location option all together but we dont want that we only want it prevented for that specify hidden share. 
 Excuses for spelling errors.

                              <span>A friend&#x27;s firm doesn&#x27;t allow its employees to sort their Outlook emails into folders/subfolders within Outlook. She did it anyway and they centrally deleted the folders she&#x27;d created. She has a lot of clients, deals, etc that she wants to organize within Outlook and now she can&#x27;t.
 My only question is why do they do that? Is there a security reason or what? I don&#x27;t get it.

 I&#x27;d like to install WSUS, but configure to not download updates locally - just block or approve updates and the client machines download the updates themselves. 
 Will this still be write-intensive? I know it might do a bunch of writing to the internal WSUS database, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would be particularly damaging to an SSD

The thing is, i want to learn new stuff bc i want to work as a Linux/Network-Admin asap, but i feel like i‘m not ready for it yet. So, do u got any ideas what i could do with a linux server for learning all this stuff and gaining new skills? I just want to try stuff by myself so i learn it quicker, so just tell me whatever gets in ur mind. Stuff like installing a mailserver or connecting the Server with a windows-pc with samba.

 Was hoping to reach out to someone who has implemented the below reg key.
 I am looking at improving log-on speeds in my organisation and this key shaves off around 20 seconds BUT I have no idea what it is doing, nor can I find anything online that&#x27;s official! 
 Was just hoping to see if anyone else implements it and what value it is set as. 
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System 
  
Value – DelayedDesktopSwitchTimeout
 Type – DWORD
 Data – 1

 I am looking for an MDM to deploy at my current company which uses no MDM at all and are heavily reliant google workspace. The company consists of around 100 users.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at solutions such as Intune however from what I understand, it does not incorporate Google Workspace.
 I am looking for a MDM which can support both windows and mac.

                              <span>I’m using Robocopy to migrate files from our production file server to an archive file server.
 I have performed a dry run and the total dataset summarised is 3TB and approximately 2M files.
 On the production server (Windows 2016) I run the data dedupe service, and we achieve a huge benefit from this as the volume is 2TB but the data on it is around 4TB and I have .5TB free space reported. My current Deduplication rate for the production volume is 67%
 If I run my live Robocopy job to migrate the folder that has 3TB reported will it retain the deduplication when moved or will it try to move 3TB of data onto the volume? Essentially undoing the dedupe.
 My Archive server has 1.1TB free space on the data volume (which is the same size as our production file server at 2TB) and also has deduplication service enabled.
 I do have the capability to spin backups of these VMs up in a lab to test the move works but with that amount of data it will take quite some time, so hoping someone here can provide some insight into their experience moving similar sized datasets.
 Cheers
 GD

                              <span>As the title says, what makes you believe online password managers like LastPass, 1Password etc are really end to end encrypted, there are no intentional backdoors or that they won&#x27;t sell your passwords to any 3rd party? Is it just their privacy policy? 
 Or is it just the fact that the benefits of using a password manager at all greatly outweighs the risks of password manager company &quot;turning to the dark side&quot;?
 By using a password manager, you are in fact completely trusting your digital identity and privacy to them. If I were any government&#x27;s agency, I&#x27;d sponsor my own password manager so that all people are willingly handing their identities over to me and I wouldn&#x27;t even need to move a finger...
 Personally, I&#x27;m using KeePass which is open source so that much wider community is able to review it&#x27;s code for possible weaknesses and, more importantly, backdoors. I&#x27;m also using a composite master key to unlock the database. One part is stored locally on my devices while the other part is a password that I regularly type. This way I can keep my password reasonably short for greater convenience and still practically impossible to brute-force by anyone that could possible get hold of my database. This enables me to keep the database in the cloud, which I also do not trust.

                              <span>Some background first. I&#x27;m a sysadmin / head of IT for a company of 150. Thankfully we&#x27;ve employed another person to deal with helpdesk and minor issues last year, so that&#x27;s good. Backup system is decent. Hopefully we will be buying a tape library in the next year to bullet proof it. People call me or inform me when they get suspicious email without opening attachments or clicking links.
 Now for the main thing. Since the ransomware we had in daughter company in 2019, every time someone contacts me with a computer, server or other it issue or I get an alarm from our systems I almost get a panic attack. Same thing when something unexpected happens when working on my pc whether it is a warning or a window pops up or a random web page stops responding for a second or two. It was not that bad in the beginning but the last 6 months were bad to the point I think of quitting without another job lined up. I have the monetary means to do it, but I would rather dealt with the issue.
 Talking with my boss and the owner is definitely on my list. How else can I deal with it?

 I have one user who when he tries to connect, gets the error message &quot;To sign in remotely, you need the right to sign in through Remote Desktop Services. By default, members of the Remote Desktop Users group blah blah blah&quot;

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I would like to know if anyone here knows how I can monitor my Carbonite backups in Centreon to see Errors, Warnings etc.
 We already do replication monitoring using a script with the Vault&#x27;s logs files, but we have no idea for backup checks at the moment.
 And unfortunately the &quot;Go Veeam&quot; answer is not possible.

 Can someone explain to me how we purchase Microsoft sql server 2019/2022 standard edition (outright, subscription or er processor)? Can’t purchase it through O365, not part of our volume license, link on Microsoft website is busted. I’ve done research into the pricing models but can’t find a damn way to get licences.
 Cheers

                              <span>We just renewed our license for our helpdesk. When I had some quality time with the boss I asked him what he thought of the helpdesk we’ve had for a year now. 
 We used to all (4 of us) just operate out of a shared mailbox. A lot of the time we’d double or triple-up on work because of the shared mailbox. We would all unknowingly work on the same thing. 
 I like the system because I have a clear list of things to work on and if I start working on something I pick it up and it’s mine. If one of the other guys starts working on it, since I’m generally faster I can be like “bro, gotta pick up what you’re working on.” (That sounds more asshole than I mean, I swear)
 Boss’ main complaint is he can’t easily tell what we’re all working on without going into our individual queues. He feels out of touch with what we’re doing. 
 So does anyone have any suggestions for a ME SD+ report that can show him what we’re currently working on and have for the last X days? Something he can quickly run to make sure we’re doing our jobs? We’re hosted so any grand ideas I have for report options are limited, and the interface is lacking (at least for me). Tried posting similar requests on the ME sub but it’s moderated to hell and nothing has been approved.

                              <span>noob question: I have four physical windows 10 pro PCs connected to a ml350p HP gen 8 running windows 2016 server (which has 3 virtual desktops) for my small business. My team connects to their physical or desktop PC remotely. ML350p is my domain controller. Assume I only use ML350p for the virtual desktops and to share files.
 All good. Except the ml350p is in my flat. It&#x27;s big, throws off heat and can get get quite noisy.
 What to do?
  
AWS virtual desktops seem really expensive eg 67 USD per month per standard desktop.
 I could get an AWS windows server but then how do i connect my physical desktop PCs to it on the domain, i think i need a VPN?
 I have [unused] one drive for business so i could get rid of the ml350p and get a few more desktops and restrict one drive for business to those physical PCs (for security i can&#x27;t let any personal PC access the one drive)
 Could I (eg) get a t3.2xlarge aws server (USD ~ 400 per month) and create seven desktop VMs on that? or would i need more windows licences/Ad server/costs?
  
I am happy to have a few more physical desktops that people remote into. I want to get rid of the physical server. I still don&#x27;t really get it - option 4 would be USD 4800 per year. i could buy a new physical server and a 2019 licence for that and then save the 4800 per year.
 I am desktop PC proficient, (build my own), pretty numerate but I find windows server really opaque. I am lost in the jargon and the options.

I could go and see how I can improve everything and make a project out of it but aside from these is there anything else to be doing ? I’m just so used to doing tickets from my last role.

                              <span>TLDR; 
 I came back to my old job, achieved a lot and doing the work of 3-4 people. Ask for a pay rise (which I will get a small one apparently soon) and then proceed to get berated by the Execs about anything and everything to do with IT&#x27;s existence and how incompetent and unimportant we are...I am now silent quitting until I leave this place.
 ​
 Edit: to clarify I actually want to do good by the company and want the best for them as they employed me out of uni so i wanted to show loyalty. Putting in current up to date technology that is cost and time saving. I want them to move to keep up to 2022 and not be an embarasent when we go to networking events. But the scrutiny and passive aggressive abuse is getting a but much...

I realize the best scenario here is to use a completely separate set of cables and switches for the DMZ network, but I&#x27;d like to avoid this if I can for the sake of this consideration.
 As a hypothetical example for the purposes of this question, I have a router, a Layer 2 managed switch, some user PCs, and a server running a publicly-accessible website.
 I have two VLANs I want to use, VLAN2 and VLAN3:
  
VLAN2 is the LAN, the user PCs are connected to this. The switch is configured to tag to VLAN2 the incoming untagged packets from user PCs on the VLAN2 ports.
 VLAN3 is the DMZ for WAN traffic the firewall permits through to ac…</span>

                              <span>I’m looking for some guidance in the right direction. I’m familiar with the basic concepts of networking but there a few concepts i am looking to understand better. 
  
The first revolves around BGP in the data center. I understand that this is really dependent on what your doing/goal. To lay this out based on my lab in EVE-ng let’s say I’ve got two nexus switches. Each one handles an ISP connection. The ISPs have 2 /30s and we are advertises out a /24. Does it make sense to have the switches handle the BGP or is it more common practice to have a device dedicated to that and the switches handle things like vxlan/spine leaf topology. 
 
How do firewalls get implemented? I can’t imagine data center firewalls would be doing router on a stick and the wan side just points to whatever is advertising the BGP? I guess I’m thinking of this as a regular office firewall but I can’t quite figure out how to google implementing a firewall into a data center.

                              <span>Based on a response to a previous question in which I asked why my local library had a such a large subnet mask (and thus possibly a large broadcast domain [255.0.0.0]), I looked up &quot;broadcast suppression&quot;. 
 Based on the documentation, the falling threshold for storm-control can be equal to or lower than the rising threshold. Why would I need to make them equal? And how would the CPU know when to block and unblock if it had different instructions for the same value? 
 Something to do with the time interval?

I thought the edge command in itself determines that it has no neighbors participating in the REP? It&#x27;s a mixed bag of using it and not where I work and I&#x27;d like to fully understand it.

                              <span>I have some ICX6430-24P switches that I inherited so I&#x27;m not an expert nor did I set these up initially. However, I have learned enough to be able to set dual-mode/native vlans on ethernet ports (1/1/1-1/1/24) but I can&#x27;t seem to get the same process to set dual-mode/native vlans on fiber ports (1/2/1-1/2/4). I have tried from the command line as well as the web interface. The VLANs page in the configuration looks correct - every vlan is tagged (except the default vlan) and then dual-mode is set on the native vlan that I want. However, when I got to the fiber port, it will still show vlan 0 as the native vlan even if I have set dual-mode on vlan 999.
 I know I&#x27;m missing something but my searches so far have turned up nothing. Thanks for any help you can provide.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have encountered an issue which I do not believe is in my control to fix, but I would like to understand what could be the cause.
 One of offices uses facilities provided wireless network where our users connect to and then establish Always On VPN over SSTP protocol to HQ. As much it is odd, this is necessary as all our computers use HQ located Proxy (for now as it is going to be replaced with cloud proxy solution).
 Down to the problem, had calls from users where they state that Outlook is failing to connect tot he Exchange server, Microsoft Teams reporting poor call quality, websites taking actual seconds to load. I have done all the checks on HQ side and all resource utilization across firewalls look O.K. No issues with Internet line saturation etc.

                              <span>Hi there, my company is in the planning stages for a fairly significant roll-out of new hardware spread across our province. This is happening in the next 8-12 months.
 We will have ~3,500 locations and each location will be getting a minimum of 1 new device, some will be getting as many as 6 or 7 devices.
 The idea is on a certain date and time, all of these devices will be powered on in small window (1-4 hours) on a exact date. This is a regulatory requirement, so we can&#x27;t pre-load or delay load to these devices.
 Each device will have to download 1-5 files from our system hosted in AWS via one of two of our datacenters The files will be 10-20MB in size. We have a Direct Connect connection from both of our DC&#x27;s to AWS.
 ~2,800 of these sites use LTE and are on a private APN, they route to our 2 datacenters via MPLS circuits from our Telco. The speed at these sites averages between 15-20Mps.
 The remaining 700 or so sites use Internet, and route to our 2 datacenters via a pair of Internet circuits from different vendors. The speed at these sites is anywhere from 3Mbps (Satellite) up to 100+Mbps (Cable)
 Now to my question, I want to make sure our MPLS and Internet circuits (and AWS Direct Connect circuits) are scaled accordingly to support all of these downloads in this window. We want to make sure the downloads happen fairly quick (say less than say 10 minutes per device).
 Does anyone know of an online calulator that would help me do the math?
 I definitely plan on contacting our Telco to get their input, but I want to have some numbers (at least rough numbers) before engaging them to make sure they&#x27;re not making shit up.
 As you can imagine this is a very large and very important implementation (we&#x27;re on year 3 of the project) for my company and I want my portion (the network) to go as smoothly as possible.
 Any input would be muchly appreciated!

                              <span>About a month ago, I cut over from a sonicwall to a watchguard firewall for a customer. One of the interfaces is an uplink to a meraki router. Apparently the sonicwall had DHCP configured for this interface but I didn’t catch that when configuring the new firewall. So the cutover happens and all appears to be working fine in the environment. Until today. The customer lost power last night and thats when the meraki router was no longer reachable. I spent an hour on the phone with the vendor who manages the meraki troubleshooting what could be the issue. I was out of ideas until they mentioned that they are configured for DHCP and that’s when I realized I never set up a DHCP sever for the interface (because when do routers use DHCP? Is this standard practice or something now?) Anyways, I configured a small address pool and the router came back online. I’m just surprised that the router maintained its lease from the previous firewall for as long as it did. At least I’m assuming that’s how it was still able to function. Anyone experience anything similar?

                              <span>We have observed an issue in a rather complicated network but I am able to create a highly simplified model to demonstrate.
 A computer in the internal network (let’s call it “client”) accessing internet through a gateway computer. Client pinging to an IP will be interrupted after the gateway has changed the upstream route, and that will require the client computer to restart to recover.
 The “gateway” computer: Windows Server running RRAS (Routing and Remote Access Service). WAN interface has static IP and connects to the higher level gateway which eventually leads to internet. Also has a Demand-dial VPN connection to access internet as a second path. NAT is set up in RRAS to share these internet connections (one at a time) to the LAN interface.

 I&#x27;m doing a minor patch upgrade on a active/standby pair. I&#x27;ve done it in a lab environment and it seems pretty straightforward using the official Cisco guide.
 In a live environment, what show commands do you recommend I do before doing the upgrade?
 I&#x27;ve done it on switches before (sh cdp neighbours, show mac address-table, show up route, show vers, etc). What would be best practice for a firewall?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all,
 New place I have started working at have a firewall with a less than optimal config. I am trying to get my head around it to make some improvements. They currently have a:
 Corporate Network (which I would like the VPN to be able to access) (10.*.*.*)
 VPN IP Range (172.1.*.*)
 Seperate Gateway VLAN (172.2.*.*) for servers they can access - these servers have an IP in both corporate and seperate VLAN, with gateway only entered on the seperate VLAN. This VLAN also has its own DNS which is what VPN clients are currently pointed to and provides the gateway VLAN ip address for these servers
 Issue is that people feel restricted, cant access file shares as if they were in work etc., have to remote on to an RDP server and productivity is suffering. My thoughts are that if the VPN is secure and has MFA in place, they can be considered secure enough to access all (or rather most - some is still locked behind other VLANs) corporate resources and work exactly as if they were in the office.
 So, to the issue - 
  
I have put a rule in place on the firewall to allow fully authenticated users access to the corporate VLAN.
 
I have updated the DNS on my computer to the corporate DNS. With this in place DNS works and I can ping ALL servers on the corporate VLAN except those with an IP address in both networks.
 
Pinging the other servers on their Gateway IP address works
 DNS gets the correct IP but I cant ping these on the corporate IP range.
 
 I suspect this is a routing and / or firewall issue but any pointers on where I should be looking would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello all, I will try to explain my Problem. Switch DGS-1248T-48 LAN + 2 shared SFP Ports. After reset all ports working.
 VLAN 1 port 1 to 48.
 WEB-GUI access only port 25-48. Web access port 1-23 do not connect. 
 Although when I connect the router to port 1, only 1 - 23 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 Router to port 24, only 24-48 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 So it looks like 1-23 and 24-48 are somehow separated or not fully functional.
 Hardware, Software or Set-up Problem ?

                              <span>Can you suggest any network test equipment for a small service provider to do network maintenance on its network? The service provider&#x27;s network is IP/MPLS.
 Do simple traffic generators suffice for network maintenance? Do protocol load tests need to be performed on a regular basis as well? Perhaps a portable version of Ixia or Spirent equipment is necessary? Or a simple VIAVI or EXFO traffic generator do the most necessary things?
 Let me ask in this way: Are network field technicians just using simple portable ethernet traffic generators (VIAVI, EXFO,...) in their routine or are they using advanced state-of-the-art test equipment (Ixia or Spirent) to diagnose problems, like scalability problems with L3VPN services?

 It is required for the networks to create trust? Is this statement talking about firewalls, and how the networks need to trust the nodes(sensors) that are connected to that network?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at a loss. We have installed a new HVAC system and each of the 4 pieces of equipment has an internal IP (statically configured - no DHCP). The HVAC vendor has specialized (and very expensive) software in his laptop that is needed in order to configure/troubleshoot/etc.
 The request is to provide him remote access to prevent the cost and travel time for him to come to the location. I am using an Ubiquiti UDM-Pro router and created a VPN. I can add desktops to this VPN (including his), but there is no way (that I know) to add those 4 pieces of equipment to this VPN network just by configuring their NICs.
 I considered creating a VLAN with or without its own public IP. That would add all the HVAC equipment on its own private subnet, but would run into the same issue on how to give his remote workstation access to this IP network? I can only think of a way to VPN the router itself given the limitations I have to change the equipment at hand.
 Hopefully I am missing something obvious. Tks in advance.

                              <span>Hi.
 We are expanding our datacenter with another datacenter about 100m apart from our main DC.
 Our current network design is that our mainbuilding (DC-1) has a core firewall/router with dual ISPs and ROAS directly to access switches. It also has direct connection to our ICS-network firewalls (for temporary RDP-access from internet) which in turn also is Router on a stick down to the ICS access switches.
 So basically theres only a core layer and an access layer.
 The new building (DC-2) will have its own subnets and networks, but will need to be connected to DC-1 since the SCADA-server is there.
 THe buildings will have a lot of fibers between them. I was thinking of placing 2x L3 switches in each building (instead of core direct access to access layer) with redudant links to each core FW in DC-1. So basically sharing the core layer between the DCs, but a separate distribution layer in each building.
 I am by no means a network expert, but has some experience. Unfortunately i&#x27;ve been asked to fix something between the DCs. Appreaciate any tips!

 I followed the guide here: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/213917-generate-csr-for-third-party-certificate.html
 I had to use OpenSSL to generate the CSR for the SAN entries, since SAN entries are not avalable on the WLC CSR prior to v17.8.1. Since the CSR was not generated by the WLC, this meant that the cert needed to be imported to the WLC as a PKCS12 file with t…</span>

                              <span>Hello Networking Community, 
 Looking for some of your opinions / recommendations for installing PhPIPAM in terms of hardware. I work for a large global enterprise who is largely currently using excel to track IP&#x27;s. Long term strategy is to bring in a enterprise grade IPAM (Efficent IP, Infoblox, etc) but in the meantime (until we can get budget) we need to get some sort of sane way (not excel) to track IP&#x27;s across a very large global org. Enter PhPIPAM. 
 I am working on getting a RHEL server built to install this on but for the life of me cannot find any sort of recommendations on hardware. I know it does not require much in terms of CPU/Mem but definitely do not want to undershoot it and have performance issues down the road. 
 Any opinions / suggestions? 
 Thanks.

 I am looking for information what mobility management function exactly mean. For me as a someone who spent the almost whole life with math, function means an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable and another variable, equation with x, y,z
 In network theory it seems, it has different meaning.
 Can someone explain what network function for mobility management mean or look like?

                              <span>Hey ppl, Im looking at getting some insertion loss test gear for optic fibre and wanted some recommendations for the better units (exfo, kingfisher, viavi) have seen fluke around too but i dont know and haven&#x27;t used them before. Thinking ill want bidirectional autotest option if possible as ill be looking at doing high fibre count testing occasionaly and would like it as simple as possible down the track. Thankyou

                              <span>Hello, i&#x27;m in position of need to have a tool which is able to do continuous traceroutes from my company&#x27;s remote data centers.
  
It should come as an some kind an agent type and should have a possibility to be installed in Linux VMs.
 All the traceroute results should be able to be seen in some kind of one centralized location
  
Maybe someone could recommend tool for that ? It could commercial or free. Till now I&#x27;ve been using the product called Pingplotter - it allows you to install remote agents in your DC and see the results in centralized location. But that remote agent traceroute capability is quite legacy one and not supported anymore - so there&#x27;re bugs which is annoying. Also - they have a new product called Pingplotter Cloud - that should do the job - but the pricing model is different, will gonna try the trial version. Also - i would like to get some input from you - if there&#x27;re other tools for that job. Thanks !!

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best way to segregate a part of a network in order to host a honeypot for statistical/SIEM analysis?
 Currently the main network infrastructure consists of a 2921 series router (cisco) and two procurve switches. I&#x27;ve got the ability to put different devices into different vlans obviously, but I&#x27;ve done a little bit of research and determined that it&#x27;s possible to break out of it, pretty easily.
 Is there a proprietary solution available for this, or is there a better solution using readily available networking principles to achieve it?
 Cheers!

 Is there software that will let me use my Hack RF or an RTL-SDR to monitor the full Wi-Fi spectrum like a WiFi-spy does?
 I&#x27;d like to avoid paying thousands of dollars, especially since I don&#x27;t have many clients yet, AND I already have hardware that&#x27;s likely better than the hardware in their WiFi-Spy device.
 I&#x27;ve tried normal SDR apps, but you can usually only see about 20MHz at a time, because it&#x27;s trying to capture the signal at real-time, which isn&#x27;t needed for diagnosing Wi-Fi.
 Someone&#x27;s gotta have done this already, right?!

 Rack &gt;Fiber panel &gt; building a &gt; single mode ------ bulding b  multimode sfp &gt; fiber panel 
 Reason I ask is because customer thinks single mode sfp are too expensive. If not, is there any other way to make it work?

                              <span>I work in a small team supporting a large HPC cluster, and because we’re a small team we rely on support contracts via our hardware vendors to ship out replacement parts and send out service techs to our data centers to fix them.
 Trying to get techs on site to fix hardware is borderline impossible compared to pre-2020. I have to follow up dozens of times to get techs out after repeated no-shows.
 We’re a Lenovo shop and that means most hardware support is done by IBM, (some part of the Byzantine IBM/Lenovo deal back in the day I’m sure). I’m not sure if this is just usual pain from IBM circling the drain or if other people are noticing this with different vendors as well? Lenovo is great at shipping out the parts but getting the tech on site is simply not happening anymore which really reduces the value of the warranty imo.
 What are your experiences with getting vendor hardware support? Are you all having better experiences with Dell or HPE?

                              <span>I am trying to create a solution to allow users to work from home and the amount of solutions for the unexperienced is a little overwhelming. Basically we run our own local AD and I want to have virtual desktops that users can remote in to from home. I started the process with the windows solution and there will be a lot of pieces, session hosts, gateways, certificates, firewall port forwarding etc for a user base that isn&#x27;t very large and I am wondering if there is a simpler option to just have 10 virtual desktops available if people need to work from home. I do not want to have the remote desktop tool installed on their physical machines at work. I also don&#x27;t want to assign a specific VM to a user, they should just automatically connect to a VM in the pool. Any recommendations or suggestions are much appreciated.

 I&#x27;ve been working with CDW for a while now and generally not had too many issues, but over the last month our rep and their sales team has become basically non-responsive.
 I am looking for a good vendor for HPE and Dell Servers, Aruba Networking and Palo Alto Networking.
 Any recommendations on what vendors are good?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Good Afternoon Everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently tasked with researching new possibilities to upgrading our current storage solutions to better fit our future and development.
 A little background on our data. We accumulate around 4PBs of data per year or so and that data rarely gets purged or removed. It is usually acquired in 2 GB files, TBs at a time. (20+ TBs per collection).
 This data gets processed on local machines or GPU/CPU clusters.
 Data is stored raw and processed.
 We currently use JBOD raids but we&#x27;ve found that with data storage being in the PBs, we are setting up new PB raids every few years or so and essentially &quot;upgrading&quot; them means rebuilding with new HDDs or just buying a whole new rack/raid. We also have an insane amount of file shares because of each raid.
 Would a scale out solution like CEPH or GlusterFS be a better solution? Would we be better off keeping RAID configurations? What other solutions could provide for this?
 I had a hard time wrapping my head around which solution would be best because of I/O density/etc.
 We aren&#x27;t against vendor supported builds but would prefer to learn and grow our experiences in storage to provide direct support later down the road and grow our professional portfolios.
 Funding and time aren&#x27;t huge issues, and we&#x27;ve been given some funds to build a small &quot;proof of concept&quot; for whichever system we can find that fits the criteria. This would include training/etc.

 The problem is that this user has lots of emails that they should no longer have access to in their new position. Is there a way to transfer their mailbox to their old supervisor without making a whole new user/email? 
 Right now our solution is just to create a whole new user with a new email and give their old supervisor access to their mailbox. However that just feels clunky. Is there a more elegant one?
 What is the best practice for lateral moves like this?
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I have 2 years of experience as a Sysadmin, 5 years total in IT. Mostly dealing with Windows, AD, GPOs, some O365, and some work with CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, and Rancher. I also have an AA, and am learning Linux and Python on the side.
 I recently got a new job as an Automation Specialist but was laid off 3 months in due to budget. I&#x27;ve been looking for jobs for 1.5 months now, and still don&#x27;t have one.
 As far as interviews go, I&#x27;ve gotten:
 15 1st interviews with HR/Recruiters
 5 2nd Interviews
 2 3rd+ Interviews
 My question is, is this normal? I know it&#x27;s not a good time of year to find a job, and the layoffs nationally make competing for full remote jobs difficult. There&#x27;s unfortunately not a lot going on in my city for jobs at the moment, especially with my limited experience. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if I should attribute this to &#x27;hard time for jobs&#x27;, or if I&#x27;m actually doing something wrong. I feel overqualified for Desktop Support jobs, but underqualified for System Engineer jobs.

                              <span>Captive Portals always seem to be problematic for Guest WiFi. Often times the captive portal page doesn&#x27;t launch, certificate issues seem to come up a lot, or people who use a VPN to log into their computer get completely hosed. So many of these just have people click Accept or at best an email address that is rarely validated. In those cases, is there really enough value to them to make it worth causing people difficulties connecting?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking on my career, and how I&#x27;m now in a job where I am just a caretaker of hardware and do some minor admin duties, but paid more than I ever have been, and how some of the most active jobs I&#x27;ve had were both the lowest paying and most stressful, but some of those were also the most fun. I looked back on the older jobs I&#x27;ve had, and I keep getting into jobs where I am doing less and less of what is in my skillset, and in some cases less actual work, while getting paid more, as I get older and gain skills. 
 I miss the days when I was managing the virtual architecture, making and managing the VMs, architecting AD, DNS, DHCP, and WDS, doing the backups, checking everything out in the morning and doing things all day long. I miss the troubleshooting days of desktop support, where I had some mysterious problem and had to actually figure out what was going wrong and fix it, rather than just wipe machines and start them over. I actually miss the days when my workload took up most of my day, but I sure don&#x27;t miss the crap pay I&#x27;d get for it. 
 Why do you suppose this is? Why is the pay for doing the most work so much lower than jobs where the workload is so much less? Has anyone else encountered this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working as Helpdesk Support for a massive corporate gaming company (6,000+ employees).
 I&#x27;m very comfortable in my job, and whilst the role is basic, the benefits are great.
 I am the only IT in the office of 150 users, and my manager is based in another country. So I report to no one in person. 
 I have my own office, with direct access to a roof terrace where I can enjoy fresh air, coffee and a view. My office has a fully catered kitchen, where we are provided fresh food and cooked meals daily. They pay for my medical insurance, gym membership and pension. The employees are great people that I get on with very well too. 
 But here&#x27;s the hitch...
 I&#x27;ve been offered 25% increase on my salary by an oil company. This company, whilst paying considerably more, do not offer these little perks. No free food, no gym, no nice view, and my desk would be in the middle of the main office.
 They would also expect me to be able to assist outside of normal hours, and even on occasion, do jobs that would not normally fall under the scope of work for Helpdesk support.
 My conundrum is do I stay where I am, in a big, comfortable, established company with all of these benefits, or risk it all for 25% pay increase? 
 What would you do?

                              <span>Hi, how do you all handle backups of object stores? From the viewpoint of an end user of object storage, not as a provider.
 For example, we host an application that uses object store as it&#x27;s backend, and we would like to backup the files in the object store, preferably the backup should land in object store as well (using block storage for backup would defeat the cost advantages of using object store in the first place).
 One option I found was using rlcone to synchronize all the contents to a different object store, however this is slow, and does not easily provide files from X days ago.
 How do you handle this problem at your organization? Or is this a killer argument against using object store at all for you?
 Curious to hear, and thanks already :)

                              <span>I have setup a mirrored storage space using 3x4TB HDDs and 1x8TB HDD totaling 4 HDDs. I will keep 4 SATA slots for the pool, 1 for the OS SSD and 1 extra as a temp slot, so would just like to ask a few question to confirm my understanding.
 Question 1:
 The useable pool size is 18.1 TB, so am I correct to assume 9TB would be usable?
 Is the 9 TB of data distributed across the 4 drives, so that there are always 2 copies?
 What I&#x27;m afraid of is that I do not have full redundancy across 9TB of data do to the uneven number of TBs relative to HDDs.
 Question 2:
 If I was to purchase a new 8TB drive can I easily removed a 4TB drive from the pool?
 So I would end up with 2x4TB and 2x8TB, pool size would be ~24TB with usable space ~12TB?

                              <span>Hi all. Just wondering if there are any H1-B (or other US based visa) employees on here? 
 I&#x27;m a UK citizen contracting to fairly large banks and insurance companies in London trying to move myself and my family (wife and 2 kids) to the US, preferably somewhere like Florida, so was just seeing if there was anyone here with a similar story?
 I’ve got 15 years experience and have run infrastructure teams in the past.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done quite a few migrations from on-prem Exchange to M365 Exchange Online. I&#x27;ve typically used the native migration tools to complete the projects, but I have used BitTitan a couple times.
 What&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s favorite 3rd party tools for completing migrations? Recently, I heard of a software that you can drop on workstations to configure Outlook after the cutover. Has anyone used this?
 Any tips are appreciated!

                              <span>We have a LoB app that uses the %TEMP% location to save attachment content for emails. User clicks task in the app, a %TEMP%/123/45678.pdf is created (both 123 folder, and 45678.pdf). Once done the app seems to rename the contract_90123.pdf. effective permissions also show full access for this location.
 That rename appears to be intermittently failing, so the expected attachment isnt present and the email fails to generate. procmon shows &#x27;path not found&#x27; on the rename operation.
 From the information i&#x27;ve gathered so far, it&#x27;s an infrequent failure but when it happens appears to occur for a period of time. We appear to be fine for a week but last week we had it occur for all generated email attachments and was 100% reproducable.
 The infra is RDS2019 (6 servers) using UPD&#x27;s, which runs on S2D storage. %TEMP% was not originally included in the UPD but as of an hour ago now included for testing. I doubt that will have any fix due. There&#x27;s no apparent heavy resource usage or noticable performance issues when the issue occurs to suspect heavy load.
 We seem to have no other issues on the RDS&#x27;s other than this rename operation failing. Running the app locally also has no problems. LoB support say it&#x27;s an issue with our environment and with it only occuing on our RDS&#x27;s, i&#x27;m inclined to beleive them.
 Any sugestions on what to do to further diagnose this one? due to the seeming isolated file, i&#x27;m out of ideas as anything i can come up with (eg: bad disk/ram/network) would affect far more than this.

                              <span>I have been out of the game for about 5 years because I started a construction company. Now, with the market and interest rates, projects are harder to find and the margins are getting slimmer.
 Before I started my company I was a sysadmin for a municipality with specialized certification for windows servers and CCNA. Now my certifications are invalid and I&#x27;m thinking of renewing certs. But I still want to have my own company and work as a consultant.
 My question is, in what area is there a lack of competence or highly sought after? I was thinking of getting certs for Azure and Office 365 with powershell and SharePoint. Is that a good way to go?
 I live in Europe where it&#x27;s more common to get a salary job than being an independent consultant.

I cant get to the logs, as system does not make it through loading Bios. I get no front panel codes, no beeps, just a repeating attemt to load bios. Ran for years prior to this with regular cleaning and maintenance. Other machines on the same lan are running fine on same os. 2012R2. Both power supplies are good. Full boat ram, was raid1. No serveices active, was mining monero well with no temperature issues. Opened the case and no evil smells, no dust bunnies etc all looks good. Any help?

                              <span>Looking to get some input from those that wish to do so.
 How do you &#x27;manage&#x27; permission changes to folder structures in SharePoint Online?
 We currently ask that users create a ticket requesting access with a link to what they need - IT then get authorisation from manager.
 Or we ask authorised managers to request it for a user.
 This is so we have a log of permission changes, this log of request/authorisation needs to stay put of course, along with the auditable actions by IT.
 It&#x27;s just of a PITA right? We get loads of requests per day, wondering how other organisations make these changes as they scale and grow as an organisation?
 Just to add, I am looking at implementing PIM/Identify Governance using security groups as a way to combat it, anyone use this for SharePoint permissions? Advice on its implementation? Best ways to allow users to know which groups are for which folders?

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone can suggest a tool like an IAM solution where it will be possible to track user&#x27;s permissions, if these apps are not integrated with SSO/IAM ?

                              <span>Hi. Is there any way to configure Conditional Access to require MFA for particular user even if he is in a trusted location? The idea is to always require MFA for admin accounts.

                              <span>Sometimes an user will suffer an IT related issue, and somehow from the symptoms presented and their limited knowledge will formulate an answer by &quot;filling in the gaps&quot; and coming up with 2+2 &#x3D; orange.
 My favourite example of this was a few years ago at a small office where filesharing was dealt with by a Dell Poweredge server, and wifi was dealt with using a few cheap APs. One day the server&#x27;s PSU fell over, and while one on-site tech was fixing it the office manager/company director asked &quot;has the server failed because there&#x27;s too much WiFi?&quot;. It took every fibre of my being to respond &quot;no, that&#x27;s not how it works&quot; with a straight face
 Another was a chap who couldn&#x27;t log in to one of our AzureAD workstations. His hypothesis? &quot;I&#x27;m logged in to my laptop at my desk so the system obviously won&#x27;t let me log in to two systems at once&quot;. The actual reason was he&#x27;d got his account password wrong...

                              <span>We chatted back and forth for 30 minutes, the dude was pretty chill and he asked me basics about me (where am i from, my academic degrees, told him about myself)...
 He asked me simple questions after that, such as the definition of DNS, kernel, OSI model... I answered most of it but he told me that i still need to give it a revision, and go for a technical test in a couple of days. 
 The test will consist on a google form with questions related to my position, so it&#x27;s all about collecting information here and there i guess..
 If i pass that test, i will jump to the technical interview which is probably the hardest part of the whole process. I&#x27;m not sure if i can make it since i barely got any experience or knowledge in cloud computing overall. I&#x27;m also not sure about what are they looking for exactly since you jump to their formation program even if u nail all the interviews, i&#x27;m not sure if i can make it to that point just with a few days of studying basic stuff.
 What would you guys suggest me?

 Sometimes the icon image also changes to the &#x27;This PC&#x27; icon image but when right clicking you can still see it is registered to the origianl application.
 Tried all the usual icon cache related fixes but can&#x27;t work out the fault or even what causes the taskbar icons to corrupt in the first place.

                              <span>Hi all, I have an odd situation:
 Two systems with identical group policy settings.
 Event log behaviour is differenct between Windows 10 and Windows 11
 The setting is question is Event Viewer &gt; Windows Logs &gt; Security &gt; right-click &gt; Properties
 Windows 10 defaults to &quot;Overwrite events as needed&quot;
 Windows 11 defaults to &quot;Do not overwrite events&quot;
 This is a problem because when security event log fills up, system won&#x27;t accept non-administrative logons.
 Running gpresult /h , the only event log settings I can see are
 Settings/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Event Log
 and there&#x27;s nothing relevant here: both are set to &#x27;retain by days&#x27; and &#x27;retain for 30 days&#x27;.
 Does any one have any ideas?
 Thanks!

 can i get windows users &amp; passwords in a text file?
  
I&#x27;m a junior dev at a small startup, so I&#x27;m doing a lot of stuff I know basically nothing about. We got these small servers called zima boards, and I think they&#x27;re supposed to be endpoints to kiosks and stuff, maybe get sensor data or shit like that idk they just threw me a box, rattled on about some bullshit I didn&#x27;t understand(I heard mqtt so it&#x27;s probably gonna be stuff like that) and said &quot;have fun&quot;. I know they said &quot;we need to get windows on it because the users and passwords would be a burden to change&quot; or something like that, and I heard a conversation which mentioned that we&#x27;re gonna be doing like 50 of these at a time, so I&#x27;m guessing my task is to figure out how to install windows on these without having to interact with each one first.
 My second question to anyone who knows windows, is it possible to get the users &amp; passwords in a text file? That would mean we wouldn&#x27;t have to install windows to begin with, and since it comes with a debian based distro we can just bash some bullshit together to create the users.
 oooh wait, is it possible to run a script with grub(somehow, haven&#x27;t done it before) to get it to boot there? If so, then I could just run a script to install grub(if not installed), reboot, then run a script which selects the device(maybe? idk all the commands to do that but it seems reasonable right?)

                              <span>What do these two plugins: Microsoft Edge Browser Version Detection and Apache HTTP Server Version check to determine the versions of their respective softwares during a credentialed scan?
 The output for the Edge plugin shows a path, implying that the plugin looks in certain directories for Edge installations - but does it ony search through &quot;C:\Program...&quot; or does it search the whole drive for any installations of Edge? 
 Similarly, the Apache plugin outputs a URL &quot;http://abc.def/:80&quot; with the port, suggesting that&#x27;s where the server instance is hosting a web-page. But does it only query the web-page and pull the Apache version that way or is there more going on under the hood?
 I&#x27;m not able to find any .nasl script files for these plugins either, so if you could point me to a resource where these exist, that&#x27;d help too.

 This is only happening with my organization based outlook accounts , it works fine on outlook and gmail
 The HTML that is being generated is same for gmail and organization office account , problem is with browser I think

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;ve noticed a increase in amount of users with issues surrounding the office apps, mostly Excel and Outlook 2016/2019. When the user is trying to save the attachment Outlook hangs for a bit or completely crashes, same with Excel - user sometimes cannot even put anything in a row/line, the app just hangs.Right now I&#x27;m trying to figure something out, I thought maybe you guys had similiar problems and maybe some fixes for previous problems would work this time around.We tried both repairing and reinstalling the Office, turning off hardware acceleration in Outlook, deleting outlook profile, starting outlook as admin, launching outlook without addons, disabling &quot;scroll inactive windows...&quot; option, increasing the allowed cache file size. No improvements unfortunately. OS in most cases is Windows 11 however the problem started around a week or two ago.

 I&#x27;m looking for any tool/solution that can support this case.
 These systems do not have DC or AD functions, just install the company software and 3rd-party tools.
 Could I use Veam Backup as the solution to migrate? Or any other solution ?

Keep in mind that we don&#x27;t really have many inside jokes, or anything like that, so make sure your gift is universal and can be given to any sys admin, so that other people reading the comments of this post can also get inspired.

Mainly working with failover clustering, lots of VM work, some low level and high level trouble shooting seting up new hypervisors, exchange servers, client devices, GPOs in AD, setting up HA for RDP servers etc built the office a new rack many cut fingers. 
 Currently having a world of fun with SCOM and SCCM.
 We are a small company so being hands on with everything is amazing and I&#x27;m surprised how much you really get to do in a smaller company.
 Is it normal to be doing this stuff so early, and is it a bad thing? I&#x27;m doing some Microsoft certs is there more I should be doing?

                              <span>Hello all!
 I have been reading a lot about PKI and moreover Active Directory Certification Services.
 I have some questions:
 - What is the difference between OCSP and CDP? What is the best scenario to have one or the other?
 - Does OCSP respond if the current client certificate is valid? Is this statement valid for regular CRL CDP as well? How do clients knows to check the ocsp? Is it embedded on the certificate as an AIA point?
 - I have noticed that when setting up the AIA you always point it to the root CA certificate, why is that? Regular CDP point to .crl files but not AIA.
 - If I don&#x27;t set up a custom IIS server with CRL, do clients pull it from default points such as LDAP? is IIS custom CDP best practice for DMZ external clients where LDAP is not accessible? why CRLs cannot be accessed through HTTPS?
 - What is the objective of using multiple SANs in a certificate?
 - What are the considerations when migrating CAs to other servers? Does it work by backing up old CA, turn off the server CA, create the new one, install role, restore CA registry backup but manitaining IP and server name? Would that keep the default CDP and AIA settings as well as matching DNS zone records. What about the IIS servers hosting enrollment and CDPs if any? What about the NDES role if it is present?
 - Can I change renewal key lenght on capolicy.inf if certificates are required to increase key length? Is there another way to do it? What tasks are needed to be done after that?
 - What is Certificate Transparency what are CT logs? How does ADCS implements it?
 What is a CAA NS record, and how does Microsoft implements it in DNS or ADCS?
 I&#x27;d be thanking anyone who can help on answerings these questions as I am really curious about the topic.

 To image the devices we usually boot to an &quot;active disk image&quot; USB and plug our external hard drive that contains the image.
 The issue we have is that we cannot select the internal SSD as the destination disk, although this has worked on previous Dell computers. The first thought it that it would be related to secure boot but i have had no success after turning this off.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 One of our users are facing login failure issues on the VPN client, I checked the logs in the VPN box and it states kerberos_kinit_password: KDC has no support for encryption. Any idea what can be done here? In the AD&#x27;s user, they ticked supported for AES 128 AND 256 inorder to avoid the issue of KDC error when upon logging to remote desktop. Side note, we&#x27;re using sonicwall&#x27;s SMA 410 VPN appliance.

                              <span>Curious to see what everyone uses to build out tools for IT to use to interact with your services. 
 Ex. We use Powershell Universal, but it&#x27;s just buggy enough and their support was useless/ refused to assist and closed my cases.
 I like to provide self services methods to look up data such as dhcp reservations or dns records, remediate accounts, block url&#x27;s, etc. When possible I give least privilege to people, but in a Microsoft cloud, they&#x27;re getting tooled to death so I like providing a one stop shop.
 Just curious what other alternatives yall have found that are stable and aren&#x27;t a huge constant time sink.

 Clients have Outlook ost files that would syncing with Exchange on their local machines. How do setup the new M365 on these clients because the &quot;onmicrosoft&quot; is dropped and it is now just username&gt;@.com? I wish to be able to have users have all their past emails available to them in the new mailbox. How do I set up their profiles then do this type of import/merge?

                              <span>Haven’t worked directly with AD directly for a while, so these are probably newbie questions.
 If I have a single DC on 2012 OS, with 2008 r2 functional level forest/domain, and I’d like to add a secondary DC (to replace one that recently failed), I don’t see a place in the instruction steps where he functional level is specified when adding the second DC. I’m assuming that this is bc the second dc will just replicate off the first one, but is this a safe assumption? 
 I’ve learned not to assume much when working with MS, so I looked for docs online that specified whether this is fine going from, say, the current OS-functional level combo to, say, 2016 OS with the same 2008 r2 functional level, but I can’t seem to find it. At some point with the newer os’s, won’t I encounter one(like 2019, 2022?) that won’t recognize or allow the new server to become a secondary dc to the existing primary one running such an old functional level? TIA!

                              <span>I have an automated job search on dice that emails me jobs in North and South Carolina for jobs with key terms like &quot;System administration&quot;.
 Until recently I would get 20 or more results and now I only get 10.
 Has anyone noticed their companies stop hiring or not replacing people who leave? 
 If so, wondering what type of industries have been slowing the pace of hiring?

                              <span>Hi, I have no SCCM for 100 Windows servers. In the past i used a end point management tool from manage engine. Now i am only allowed to use Microsoft software and WSUS. Branch offices are receiving updates directly from MS via reg key. I guess the task scheduler is not save to use because of several viruses. Do you have a powershell script which restarts and reports like the software patchbatch? Restart via csv file an remotePowershell is easy. But logging and uninstall and mail reports when everything worked or not will be hard. There are also some cmdlets with useful functions, but i am not sure which one is trustful and how to deploy on all servers.

                              <span>I’m a junior studying CIS, it’s part of the business college at my university. What type of certs would be my greatest asset to have? I only have 5 CIS classes the rest is business related. I have applied to some internships. Just waiting to hear back. My goal is to become a system admin before studying MIS in the masters degree. Thanks for any advice.

 i tried Pandora and it&#x27;s full of errors &amp; lack support on the internet, also tried vray but it&#x27;s taking almost the same time when rendering on user pc which is not a good sign
 i&#x27;m searching for free software to create this task and make it work, any ideas?

                              <span>Since our spam filters are very busy this time of year I started on this (A wonderful time of the year tune).
 It is a very busy time of the year. We have spammers aplenty and everyone telling you, &quot;You need click here&quot; It is a very busy time of the year.
 It&#x27;s the scam spammiest season of all With those holiday emails and sad sappy tails That’s how spammers are coming to call It&#x27;s the scam spammiest season of all
 Those emails are posting your PII and boasting that you are not in the know There&#x27;ll be scary scam stories and tales of the queries That warn of the scams long ago
 It is a very busy time of the year. There&#x27;ll be much user tricking And a lot of link clicking While IT watches in fear It is a very busy time of the year.

                              <span>Hello admins, after the first few years in the job, I am currently considering how I can organize myself better. I know there are various tools, but somehow this is not really effective so far. I sometimes find it difficult to focus and &quot;forget&quot; something that I only remember some time later. The goal is better time management. It works so far rather semi well. Information/tasks come via various channels and I would like to manage this for myself in one tool(best cross platform). 
 Tried Task,ToDo,OneNote,Google Keep…. but hasn&#x27;t really worked for me so far.
 Now the question to you, what and how do you use tools to organize your daily work and projects and not lose focus?
 Thank you all and have a nice Sunday.

                              <span>That&#x27;s my job, literally my entire job. 
 Just spent 13 hrs yesterday trying to migrate never patched VMs from 2013 and get them to boot up on Azure. Not just that the client wants their disks to be BitLocker encrypted, that was 6 hrs of screen-sharing &amp; logs sharing with the Critical Situation support team from Azure. 
 All this in a fixed time-frame, if a VM doesn&#x27;t migrate - it has direct monetary impact on the project. Which leads to every hour updates, extreme levels of micro-management; hell the only time I got up was to piss, 3 times in 13 hrs. 
 My team is made up of 4 recent graduates(almost good for nothing at the moment), 1 team lead who disappears when he is needed, 2 engineers who can&#x27;t write a single line of powershell if their life depended on it. And then there&#x27;s me, I have written SOPs for every single action that needs to be performed, have automated over 120 minutes worth of manual configurations; I lead the migration, fix other&#x27;s mistakes, deal with app owners and their bs expectations. I deal with the curt/narcissitic MDs of my company, while my manager makes sure everything &quot;looks good&quot;, because things need not be good, they just gotta look good.
 tldr; V2V/server rehosting is stupid, do not do it. Just build a new VM and install your shit on it.

My current server is currenly runing a MySQL server and web servers (NGINX/APACHE). I want to upgrade the server and wanted to know what specs would give me a good amount of wiggleroom for growth.
 My current specs are: 
 4 CPU
 8GB Ram
 50GB SSD
 ​
 is this a good amount of what specific parts should i be looking at? I&#x27;m using DigitalOcean by the way.

                              <span>So I started my IT career in 2020 after covid wiped my previous job, and since then I studied a lot from the very basics of network devices, ip adresses, etc. I went through the AZ-800 Microsoft material, and tomorrow will be my first day as a junior sys admin. I am going to work with two guys one them is a senior. We are going to work on cloud infrastructure, o365 stuff, Ms Azure / AWS. 
 Just wanted to ask you guys what advise can you give me to have a good start as I don&#x27;t want to mess up.
 Thanks

                              <span>tl;dr - Turns out someone read the RFCs wrong.
 Your software should support 465 and optionally 587 – implicit TLS via submissions over port 465 is where we&#x27;re moving to, according to RFC 8314 from 2018.
 Dunno about everyone else, but I was definitely under the impression that STARTTLS on 587 was the widely deployed &quot;better&quot; option. Seems like it&#x27;s just widely deployed where implicit TLS should be.
 Happy SNI sounds, because multiplexing SMTP traffic sucks otherwise.

                              <span>I am building a file downloader using c# httpclient which downloads files from an asp.net IIS server. My test is downloading 46GB of data spread out over about 40k files, done by about 4k instances of the downloader process (this is done in a build system, so each instance of the downloader is run/cached separately,). This works out to an average of 10 files downloaded per httpclient instance and an.average of 1MB per file.
 Everything works fine until minute 4, when suddenly my download speed goes to 0. I have a timeout of 1 minute on the process and 5 attempts are made to download each file. About 2 minutes after the stalled downloads, it starts back up again. This is after the first two attempts timed out. The server logs show that it didn&#x27;t even seem to receive the request that was being asked of it, and when it did receive a request, the server claims it handled it quickly.
 So far to troubleshoote I have tried to increase the dynamic port range, and limit the number of requests being sent at once to 75. Still this happens pretty deterministically around the 3-5 minute mark.
 Is there something I can check and try to figure out why it is stalling? I know Wireshark can be a useful tool, but I don&#x27;t really know what I am looking for in this case. Thanks!

                              <span>I run a small WISP and am moving to Mikriotik HAP line for user routers. I have a big goal to eventually set up a mechanism to redirect past due clients to a &quot;Hey, pay your bill&quot; web page.
 Originally, I was trying to make this a function of DHCP with classes for user MACs that are active or suspended. Active clients will be given an IP on a subnet that is allowed out via NAT permit policy, wheras suspended MACs would be placed on a subnet not allowed out to the internet and has all DNS queries pointing to the IP of my web server (via bind9 views one using normal DNS forwarding and the other pointing to a local dnsmasq instance) with rewrite rules to my &quot;pay your bill&quot; page.
 This ALMOST worked, but when you have multiple IPs on one VLAN, one IP must be the primary IP and that put a halt to anything working. This was because the relay agent will always use the primary IP for the relay agent IP to determine which pool to grant an IP from. I can get a device from active to suspended if the suspended IP is the default, but it will not go back since the relay agent IP will always be the primary IP on the VLAN.
 This led me to consider RADIUS, since you can use Framed-IP-Address to reassign an IP.
 I have a working baseline FreeRADIUS server set up that accepts usernames, passwords and secrets and correctly responds. It is backed by MySQL. I can figure out mac-auth and the rest but I need to know how to make the HAPs authenticate themselves once they get on the network.
 The imagined flow would be DHCP on the primary (suspended) subnet. Radius processes if the MAC is active or not. If it is not it will stay on the suspended subnet. If the MAC is active RADIUS will provide an IP on the secondary (active) subnet.
 Is there a way to make what I am aiming for work?

I know what they do and why they are sent but why is it important to keep track of every byte sent out by the host?

                              <span>Recently ordered some HP i210 adapters from Amazon (shipped and sold by) and have a suspicion they are fake. Label says made in Thailand and the CE on that sticker seems correct. Mfg date is 08/2022. They don&#x27;t have any holo stickers on them (yottamark or bradyId) and the crystal does not say TXC. Are these still indicators of an authentic intel card on the i210? Doesn&#x27;t seem to be much info out there about this model as most guides focus on the i350.

                              <span>Hello,
 I got some reports one our our remote networks has been running a little slow. 
 I ran a packet monitor on the locations SonicWall and saw an insane amount of ARP requests, all coming from the same MAC which I&#x27;ve identified as the Modem for that location. The ARP requests are NOT for our network, so the SonicWall is dropping them. All of the ARP requests are sourced and destined for IP&#x27;s in our ISP&#x27;s range (WOW). In about 30 seconds we&#x27;ll drop a little over 5000 ARP packets. I was originally investigating an OSPF issue when I found this. Could this be a routing issue on our part, or does this seem like the ISP is at fault? I&#x27;ve called them twice now and its been very unhelpful. 
 Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.

                              <span>Hello there, so awhile back my father made his own ethernet cables for me but its starting to rip up so I need to buy new connectors, thing is I&#x27;m not sure which Cat cable he purchased. I think it&#x27;s 6 but can&#x27;t be sure so was wondering if anyone could verify for me, thanks.

                              <span>Hi! :)
 I recently read in an article, that ISPs could determine if the user uses tethering, so if the packet originated from a PC/Laptop rather than from the phone itself because the phone would use a different TTL than the connected device.
 Is this true? Would my phone use a different TTL for its packets than my Linux/MacOS/Windows device? Respectively is the TTL dependent of the used OS?
 Or did the website mean, that my phone would represent another hop in the network so that the packets would have a lower TTL? (Couldn&#x27;t it just be that the packet went randomly another hop?)

 Could you please help me, I&#x27;m a new sysadmin on my companie, We bought a new app that is deployed on a local server, I want to give SSH Acces to the support team of the app who are outside of my network.
 I thought about portforwarding to SSH Port I don&#x27;t know if it is safe. Someone told me about a VPN but I don&#x27;t know how to configure it.
 - I have a fixed public address.
 - I have a Cyberoam firewall 
 NB: I don&#x27;t have credentials to access the server.
 Thank you. 
 Sorry for my bad english it&#x27;s my 3rd language.

 What I noticed was that the download speed was very fast! yes, faster than my internet speed and I didn&#x27;t have up to 800MB as my data balance but the file was still downloaded completely. 
 Is my mobile/wifi data only used to maintain the ssh connection? That is not to disconnect.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Been in end-user support as a field technician for about 2 years and spoke to my boss about wanting to transition into system admin/active directory and go on the cybersec pathway for climbing up. Company owner agreed to reserve the next trainee position for me and we&#x27;ll be meeting up next week to be discussing the terms of the position etc.
 For some background, recently I asked the company owner for a letter of good faith to be released to one of our contractees as a employee in an attempt to move upwards, however was turned down for lack of experience, which is where he offered me training and a junior system admin position. He&#x27;s been very accommodating with me so far and even gave me a raise recently. 
 If anyone could give me their 2 cents and some insight into what I should expect as a junior system admin going from end-user support. that would be cool.

Ideal would be an agentless network monitor which could drill down and crucially allow a jump off into RDP or similar onto an endpoint... whilst processing logging, potentially a light SIEM capability, amd asset management. And a laser beam to scratch my bum from space.
 Closest I&#x27;ve found is Auvik, possibly ManageEngine. Solarwinds ticks most boxes as a solution.. but...well. Not sure I&#x27;m ready to forgive on that one...
 Any suggestions and experiences gratefully received.

                              <span>I currently work in IT and there have been many non-IT platforms migrated from on-prem to the cloud.
 When these programs were on-prem, they had very simple passwords as access was only permitted via VPN or no-prem network. When they were moved to cloud, there was no care or concern to change them.
 I have reported these security issues to our IT management and no action was taken.
 FYI, username was simple like admin or administrator and the password was shown on the same page or the default that the vendor has for their clients. Also, these platforms give full admin access and full view of all information, statistics, user privileges, clients etc.
 These cloud platforms run the core functions of our organization and are used by every department (no 2fa, with no password policies, no restrictions and are globally available via subdomain).
 Additionally, our InfoSec team has been aware and have let management know, but no action either. Also when these platforms were migrated, InfoSec was not involved in any step too.
 What do I do (or not do)?

                              <span>We are looking at Absolute (https://www.absolute.com/) as a asset management solution. In our onboarding meeting yesterday with their team, we were unable to deploy the agent via Intune, because the msi file requires access to two additional files during the install. They do not seem to have an agent that is deployable via Intune.
 Has anyone successfully deployed the agent via Intune?

                              <span>Rackspace is having a major outage, and it looks like ransomware. ETA on a fix is unknown, and I need to start working on a solution asap. 
 We have a few thousand mailboxes on Rackspace Email and less than one hundred on Hosted Exchange on the same domain. Rackspace’s temp fix requires us to migrate everyone to M365, but I’m wondering if I could(should?) spin up a new domain for the impacted Exchange mailboxes only.
 They’d be fresh mailboxes, but it might buy us the time needed to recover from the attack. Migrating a few thousand healthy mailboxes seems like a bad idea just to save less than one hundred.
 I’m not taking any action until I’m able to speak with them. Left a callback request with support, but no response yet.

 But it is disabled by default. Am I misunderstanding what the setting does?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Just reading more things about rackspace bubbling up to the surface and started wondering about other exposure.
 With the ongoing crisis on their hosted exchange platform, does anyone have concerns about 365 tenants rackspace has delegate admin rights in via partner relationships for licensing purposes?

                              <span>I have a service /lib/systemd/system/hellod.service that runs in the background and listens on a socket in /tmp/hello.sock.
 And then I made a oneshot service in /lib/systemd/system/hello.service, which takes a command hello foo bar, and sends it to the socket mentioned above.
 Is this the correct way to go about implementing the client side aka the oneshot hello.service or am I doing something wrong? And is there a better way?
 The reason why I chose this is because it allows me to then call the script simply by hello command.
 For the server:
 [Unit] AssertPathExists&#x3D;/usr/bin/hellod [Service] ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/hellod Restart&#x3D;always PrivateTmp&#x3D;false NoNewPrivileges&#x3D;false [Install] WantedBy&#x3D;default.target 
 And for the client:
 [Unit] Requires&#x3D;hellod.service After&#x3D;hellod.service AssertPathExists&#x3D;/usr/bin/hello [Service] Type&#x3D;oneshot ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/hello --init RemainAfterExit&#x3D;true PrivateTmp&#x3D;false NoNewPrivileges&#x3D;false [Install] Alias&#x3D;hello WantedBy&#x3D;default.target 
 Also is /usr/bin/ the correct location to store the hello and hellod scripts?
 And whats the correct location to store user configurable files, maybe /etc/hello?

                              <span>Can I get some advice and opinions please.
 I began a quick format on a 60TB SAN storage partition connected over iSCSI around 6 hours ago on Server 2019.
 The aim is to start fresh for backup storage due to capacity issues.
 Disk Manager just says &quot;formatting&quot; with no percentage or any other indication of what is happening here.
 Was this approach the wrong way to do this?
 Should the operation to prepare the drive have been done via the SAN management application?
 Wondering if this will ever finish.....Should I cancel the format operation and just delete the existing data in there?
 Is cancelling at this point risky? The data is not important but I need the storage to be reliable and ready to be reused 
 Is there any way of telling if progress is being made? The only indicator I can think of for now is to go to Resource Manager and I can see the drive activity is maxed and running so at least I know its not hung. 
 Any estimates on how long it may take to complete?
 *** EDIT ***
 OK answer here became obvious..... Rebooted Server. Deleting, recreating partition with a quick format then worked within 5 mins. 
 Lesson I&#x27;m taking out of this is to preemptively reboot before starting anything that could suck up time and cause worry and frustration.
 Thanks again for the help all.

                              <span>I recently came into possession of a UPS that was decommissioned from an old server rack at my friend&#x27;s office. They were throwing it out so I gladly took it off their hands. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know it was a 240v UPS. My homelab is entirely running on 120v and I don&#x27;t have any 240v outlets in the server room.
 The server rack is currently on a circuit which has very low load (aside from the rack itself). I see 3 options here, which are below:
  
Purchase a step-up transformer to plug into the 120v outlet, to give the UPS 240v output
 Use two different out-of-phase outlets on different circuits and wire them to a single 240v plug
 Pay an electrician to run a new circuit dedicated for the UPS
  
Obviously Option 3 is the most ideal option, but running a new circuit will be somewhat difficult and expensive due to the layout of my house. Option 2 sounds sketchy as hell, but should theoretically work (I have two different circuits in the server room). Option 1 sounds easy, but I am worried about dirty power or low amperage.
 What do you guys think?

                              <span>Does anyone have experience running/building a primarily tape based data archiving system for long term(10-50 years) storage?
 I&#x27;ve been recently handed such a project and have been reading up on it and trying to find suitable solutions or software components to implement it. If anyone has any experience in the subject I&#x27;d like to hear it.
 I know of irods, which is a data management system but doesn&#x27;t handle the storage itself.
 Tape based is a requirement, so is an open format(ltfs, otf etc) for long term compatibility. Some form of cataloging is also required. And automated ingestion is a plus.
 So far I&#x27;ve come up with irods+cea phobos. Or spectrum archive library edition + mergerfs and irods.
 Edit: I also know of fujifilm object archive. But it&#x27;s a paid solution.
 Edit 2: cloud is not an option, should&#x27;ve probably included that from the beginning.

I agreed to interview, which was supposed to be the hiring manager and a technical lead.
 Instead they ended up having 2 level 3 admins interview me. They were mostly concerned with who I knew at Rackspace and when I didn’t know anyone they wondered how I got an interview.

The real nail in the coffin was Rackspace&#x27;s absolutely dreadful &quot;support&quot;. So far everything is working great. As of a few weeks ago our Rackspace account is fully deactivated.
 Here are the steps I recommend for other small companies that are cost-conscious:
 1) Through Rackspace&#x27;s Office 365 page, buy Rackspace-managed Office 365 licenses for all the users. These show up in 365 Admin as &quot;Reseller&quot; licenses, as opposed to licenses purchased directly from Microsoft which show up as &quot;Commercial direct&quot;.
 2) Use Rackspace&#x27;s email migration tool (which is actually BitTitan MigrationWiz reskinned for Rackspace) to migrate all of the Rackspace/Hosted Exchange addresses to 365. This tool comes bund…</span>

  ROBOCOPY &quot;\\remoteserver\folder1&quot; &quot;E:\folder1&quot; /mt:16 /E /ZB /XD DfsrPrivate &quot;.trashes&quot; /PURGE /COPYALL /R:0 /W:0 /NP /log:&quot;C:\Robocopy Scripts\folder1.txt&quot; 
 Thanks

                              <span>I have been looking into the process of renaming an Active Directory Domain, out of curiosity rather than the need to actually do this in production.
 The process itself, using the rendom utility seems straightforward and is well documented online.
 There are, of course, caveats and unsupported scenarios i.e Exchange on premise.
 It is obviously a major change to the core structure of a network as you are changing AD name, Dns, renaming Dcs, Group Policy, and Pcs.
 My question is ... have you ever done this in a production environment and, most importantly, how did it go?
 Was it smooth sailing?
 Were there unexpected consequences or issues post rename?

                              <span>Sorry for venting but this pisses me off. Also English is not my first language, so bear with me.
 ​
 To set up the scenario: I am 40+, working 20+ years in IT and do something IT management and network engineering related nowadays. Started off somewhere around the Y2k problem with floppy disks in my hand ;)
 ​
 Yesterday a somewhat recently retired neighbour of mine approached me via WhatsApp if I could come upstairs in the evening to help with &quot;an IT problem related to hard disks&quot;. This was the first time in the last 12 years we live here.
 ​
 I texted back that I am sorry but I do not do any IT support outside my family, because the small issues could easily escalate in terms of time and knowledge invested and that this was abused in the past. Got no answer.
 ​
 Today I met him outside the house and was getting blasted with how angry he is and how I lack a sense of community and how &quot;all IT people&quot; tell him the same (ah?) and that we all need help (what?). And that his question would be something about his TV and that is HDD is now empty/blank.
 ​
 To top it off, he yelled at me in front of my kids while we were on our way to get a Christmas tree.
 ​
 Really?
 ​
 Am I supposed to get &#x27;ready for work&#x27; on a Friday evening after an exhausting week to peek into something which is both outside my expertise (datacentre !&#x3D; TV) nor interest?
 ​
 Why is it that non-IT people seem to take it as totally granted that you fix any consumer product because &quot;you work in IT&quot;.
 ​
 I am totally sick of it. Am I the asshole or do I have one as neighbour?
 ​
 Any advise, pat on the back or other form of moral support is appreciated :]

                              <span>I hope this is the best sub to post in. I have a 20-year career in Infrastructure. Lots of Linux/Unix. Lots of networks. General infra like VMware, storage, sysadmin etc. I have moved to use the cloud in the last 7 years as well. I have (finally) been promoted and now find myself Head of Infrastructure. It&#x27;s a lofty title for what I actually do but it&#x27;s good. I have two teams I supervise, an infra team of more classic sysadmins, and a DevOps team which is developers who are interested and work in infra stuff. My role is extremely hands-on around 50% still doing infrastructure engineering but I am gaining more staff so that will continue to reduce with time.
 I am planning for the future and looking at similar roles to see what I need to be aiming for. What I am interested in right now is what sort of interview questions should I expect for these sorts of roles. Since I didn&#x27;t interview for my Head of role I&#x27;ve never had a management interview. 
 What are the general questions I should expect, is there any changes to my interview style over engineering roles I need to anticipate? (I found being extremely relaxed and personable worked very well, but I understand cultural differences here come into play as London and Stockholm, where I have worked, are very relaxed environments for engineering roles where that might not be the case where you are from). Any other general advice anybody might have?

All employees are working at our office and have an in-house storage server sharing files/projects to the editor&#x27;s PC using LAN. so, we gave access to the editor of a file according to assign their project. After covid pandemic, we want to shift our all IT infrastructure remotely. For same, we are planning to use AWS ec2 for computation power, and for storage, we want to utilize only our on-premise storage server. Any service/product that can help to achieve this type of solution?

 Note: 
  
we can&#x27;t use storage in the cloud for projects ( Because one project storage size is 20-30 TB If we give storage to individual VM then it will cost us) to allocate that project we want to utilize an in-house storage server in a Virtual Machine.

 Which of these columns should I be monitoring for indicating a memory leak or does this cmd miss the mark? Or is there a different attribute I should be looking for since expanded properties is quite lengthy? I just grabbed the ones related to what I thought were memory related.

 I setup a new Ubuntu computer and went through the default steps to join the domain. It accepted everything and I logged out and tried logging back in using my domain credentials and it didn’t reject it but it just kept saying that it’s logging in.

 I realize that this feature is still in “preview”, but it is so annoying enrolling the users with a csv. Why do you have to set the UPN in the csv? Why does Microsoft not let you assign them once the seeds are already in azure? We don’t really care for the idea of keeping a seed file around while we wait for new users to onboard so we can assign them. 
 Then having to activate the token after the fact takes forever when you have large groups onboarding. 
 I would love to only use authenticator, unfortunately we cannot force them to use their personal device for it. 
 Does anyone have insight into this or workarounds?
 Thanks!

 So, is there any way to get all the patches for the month released; including Cumulative updates, Rollup updates etc., ?

                              <span>Hello Friends,
 I work for an IT company and have 15 years of experience in Telecom domain. I worked on various Network Inventory design and Audit projects which were not much technical in nature. The network inventory design involved the various vendors SDH/SONET transport devices, Cisco and Nokia switches and routers.
 I don&#x27;t have any hands on experience configuring the routers and switches in the live network.
 In my current project, I am responsible to setup E2E test environment (Integration of applications) and physically connect the various DOCSIS cable modems and gateways and fiber ONTs devices in the test lab and auto provision them in ICOMS and backend systems.
 I am doing good in this project and my efforts are highly appreciated by the client managers.
 But then I really don&#x27;t know what to do next to progress in my career. 
 Recently, I cleared AWS solution architect associate exam.
 I am planning to upskill myself in following areas and would need some geniune advice on what should I do next.
 I have a weakness of not being consistent with my studies or certifications. Back of the mind, I think what is the use of doing certifications if there is no real practical experience and companies prefer to appoint those who have solid hands on experience.
 Please suggest

 Ansible Network Automation

Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been going through some online tutorials about Cisco ACI but some of the concepts are so confusing I couldnt get my head around. I am from Nexus N9k standalone background, could someone explain these terms in an easy way:
 - Bridge domain (What is the difference between VLAN, SVI and bridge domain)
 - EPG : Is there any equivalent term or concept in a standalone cisco switch?
 - L3Out and Interface Profile: L3Out I understand is when you want a leaf in the fabric to establish L3 adjacency to external router, this seems bit easy to grasp but what exactly is Interface Profile again?

 My EdgeSwitch at work is telling me that there are two devices plugged into Port 1 and Port 2, and that they are using PoE and they are sending/receiving data, but the Mac table doesn&#x27;t seem to know what the IP addresses are. 
 Can anyone explain to me what I might be seeing here? I feel like I&#x27;m in patch panel hell right now trying to figure out where all these unlabeled cables go.

                              <span>Hi, im curious how you segment and design your ICS network?
 What makes up of your security zones? Do all traffic pass through your firewall? Do you do l3 segmentation with vrfs and sandwich the firewall?
 We currently have a ROAS design with subinterfaces to 2x l3 switches, which in turn have dot1q trunk links to the access switches.
 Since we&#x27;re increasing in hosts I was wondering if maybe we should decrease the traffic going through the fw by instead do intervlan routing and route only specific vrfs to firewall. I heard this is a popular design.
 Would be nice to see some examples of how a design would be.

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 Here is our dilemma - 
 We have Cisco FPR 2140s (4 of them, 2 HA pairs, 1 pair at each data center). We are currently trying to setup ECMP but we found out that SSL cannot be enabled on interfaces that you want to participate in EMCP. Fine, we are in the process of converting them to IPsec but the implementation of IPsec RA VPN to a Cisco firepower sucks honestly. It seems it was an after thought as there has to be a local XML on every endpoint in order for the first connection to be made (after the first connection, the endpoint pulls the XML from the firewall)
 We don&#x27;t think we can do this because of the mobile IoT devices that our company VPNs with. We also have some site to sites that are causing us to make VTIs and our company just keeps growing it seems and the firewalls are getting more complex with that. (sorry for the rant)
 QUESTION - We are looking into getting 2 separate firewalls (1 at each data center) to handle RA VPN, site to sites and any other odds and ends. We have public IP addressing to accomplish this but I am wondering if anyone else does something similar? Breaks portions of config onto different devices just to make it more simple rather than trying to do everyone on one firewall

                              <span>I have set up 2 VLANS, both working fine. The fist VLAN is for my 15 cameras and the second one is for my 5 wired computers. The problem is that when I&#x27;m on any of the 5 computers I cannot connect to the managed switch gui to manage it. I am assuming I need to do something that &quot;allows&quot; a computer in a VLAN to get to the managed switch GUI but I haven&#x27;t had any luck. My managed switch background is weak but I&#x27;m assuming such a setting/config change would be similar across mfg&#x27;s switches. Anyone have any idea? PS, I have to move the cable to a port outside of the VLAN in order to manage the switch.

                              <span>I look at the SD-WAN solutions out there, and I just feel like I&#x27;d be better off with a traditional routing design in most cases, especially given the siloed nature of most organizations (eg..separate networking, server, security groups etc...). That means separate appliances for separate groups that provide a clean separation of responsibility. 
 The market has been flooded with SD-WAN products and the marketing is starting to become all a blur. 
 Just wondering who here has bought into a vendor&#x27;s SD-WAN story and how are they liking it?

                              <span>My lecturer said that it&#x27;s layer 5 as it&#x27;s associated with authentication but every network professional I asked at work said it&#x27;s layer 7 as 2FA interacts with applications and the end user.
 Initially I thought it was layer 7 from my understanding but upon researching more, I&#x27;m stuck between the two as 2FA is authenticating (L5) but is also interacting with end users and applications (L7). Is it possible that 2FA works at both layers?
 Btw in my scenario 2FA will be protecting access to a network&#x27;s server as well as applications. Thanks

 ​
 One other concern I have is noise level. Is anyone aware of just how loud supermicro&#x27;s switches are?

                              <span>Just wondering what everyone&#x27;s thoughts are on Application Guard. It sounds super slick. I set it up on my testing computer and it works. 
 But is it just me, or is it unnecessarily cumbersome for both the user and the administrator? I kind of get the administrator part, that&#x27;s to be expected. But launching a completely different window seems like it&#x27;s really going to get on users&#x27; nerves and be a hard sell to decision makers. Especially when the decision makers/contributors themselves are the ones that have to be on external sites regularly.
 It would be nice if the Application Guard instance opened in a new tab rather than a whole new window similar to the IE mode.
 How do others manage Application Guard?

Is there something I&#x27;m missing from the user-mapping.xml so that when my ldap users login they have those RDP connections? I&#x27;ve gone through the Guacamole documention but I can&#x27;t seem to find what I&#x27;m missing. Or I just don&#x27;t understand. Thanks for any help.

I am very happy about this but still have a long way to go before I feel comfortable with this new position. I have never officially managed a team and I am mind blown that I was offered the position today. With that being said I want to be the best that I can my team consist of one other person with contractors helping us when needed to complete task. We will be looking for a backfill for my position soon. Is there any advice you all have for an IT Support Engineer that is stepping into management for the first time?

                              <span>I am sys admin and part of my jobs are processing file. half an time file has all kind of error, and my legacy system has hard time to pre-parse and figure out the error. so I want to have a pre-processor to validate the file against the spec. common error is like this
  
spec has 200 fields, csv contains 195
 field should be A or B or C, but cvs contains 1.2
 field is required, but csv has blank value
 field is limit to 255 characters, csv send 300
  
should this be a python, shell script, cmd line (I am using windows)? is notepad++ has a plugin for that?
 Thank you!

 I have no experience at all with xpath until playing around with PowerAutomate to do this, so I have a feeling my issue is with my queries being as bare basic as possible, with my secondary thoughts being that my flow is not configured to do more than a single loop and only taking the first value.
 Could someone point me in the right direction outside of reading through https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp?

 Does anyone have a good guide for applying CU&#x27;s to Exchange 2016 servers? Last time we applied one it was a nightmare. We don&#x27;t have a DAG or anything fancy. We just ran into so many errors during the install, mostly related to AD. 
 Thanks!

 Where would you place a PDU and a server in a rack and why would you choose that arrangement? 
 I was thinking for PDU its better to have it close to the bottom for short cabling but I’m not sure with servers.

                              <span>Just trying to get some issues resolved that I been dealing with this week, and just trying to talk to someone with various vendor support has been agravating. I got 2 issues with some software with one company and I put the ticket in on Tuesday and never got a call back 9the person you initially talk to won&#x27;t even try to help and just takes name and number), I called yesterday and had to call 3 times to talk to the person on my case. they gave me something to try, but it didn&#x27;t work. I called 4 times today, and kept getting told the person on my case was either on a call or on lunch and I would get a call right back. Here we are 20 min before I am about to leave and I just called again after being told at 2:20 that the agent was on lunch and to try back in 30 min. So just called and was told they are on lunch and try back in 30 min...so they taking a 2 hour lunch?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been beating my head on the wall trying to fix this weird issue: when I move computers to a different OU (with different Policy), the computers would still obeying the old policy that was applied to them in the former group.
 For example, I was having a container where computers are locked out after 30 minutes of inactivity and another container where computers are locked out after 8 hours.
 I moved a few computers from the 30 mins group to the 8 hours group.
 I ran gpresult /r on said computers and the results showing the new policy was successfully applied (8 hours). Local group policy showing that they are supposed to be logged out by 8 hours. But lo and behold, the naughty computers still locked themselves out after 30 minutes.
 So far I have tried many fixes, including 
 - Clear group policy catches
 - Took them off the domain, force policy update there, and put them back on.
 - anything else I could think of.
 ​
 Have you ever run into this issue? Please enlighten me! (I am a new system admin and inherited this weird ass system that needs a lot of reorganizing).
 ​
 Thank you so much!

 We’ve all been there before - the wording from a third party when something is fubar. The lack of updates, and in this case phrasing straight out of the offshore 1st line support playbook. This issue is at 12 hours odd now, to still be in the investigation stage says they know what’s wrong, it’s big, they don’t have a fix, or, they have no clue, which 12 hours in is a worry. 
 At this point, if you have users in rack space hosted email, I’d be looking at standing up a new solution to give functionality from now, and worry about historic data later - I fear this may not be a quick fix, or even something with a full fix. 
 I can’t think of anything that would create a 12 hour outage of exchange/hosted exchange that’s still in investigation (figuring out wtf is wrong) beyond something that is known, and the investigation is how the fuck do we unfuck this!
 Be prepared for the worst, hope for the best!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at various UEMs to help us manage our Windows workforce, much of which is remote (working from home), off the corporate network. Today we use PDQ Deploy + Inventory and love it, but it&#x27;s limited to on-net management. PDQ Connect is coming and looks like it&#x27;s going in a good direction, but I&#x27;ve got almost 1,000 PC&#x27;s to a manage now, so I&#x27;m open to alternatives - and the solution that keeps coming up is Microsoft Intune. 
 We would like an application deployment solution that is flexible but will also let us run Powershell scripts, create groups and reports, and ideally provide a way to access the remote computer over the internet. Bonus if it works for Mac as well as Windows (though we are 99% Windows). One of the things I&#x27;ve seen with Intune that I really like is the ability to create PC profiles and once a user logs in to Azure AD, Intune (or Autopilot?) automatically deploys a profile to the computer. That seems powerful. 
 Other thoughts on Intune as a potential alternative (or accompaniment?) to PDQ?

                              <span>Hey all. I&#x27;m trying to get management to approve a display to show IT data like virus attacks, network speed, and all kinds of IT info. Does anyone have anything like this that wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing a pic of what the display would look like so I can show management, just to get the approval for the display? We have a TV that we are swapping out and I thought it would be nice to have it for showing off data to people that are interested.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been asked to create an IT solution for a management issue. They want me to block YouTube on a single machine. My first thought is to do this at the network&#x27;s firewall but ran into two issues. Our firewall is managed by our ISP, so it could take a while to implement, and I&#x27;m not quite sure how to target the single machine that&#x27;s on DHCP, by MAC address maybe?
 Anyways.
 My current solution is to modify the hosts file and dump each web browsers cache. I have a PowerShell script for the hosts entries because YouTube has quite a few, and then I manually dump the browser caches. Any ideas how the user could get around this (beyond the obvious, user can edit the hosts file themselves because everybody here still has local admin, against my recommendations), or is there a better way?
 $baseEntry &#x3D; &quot;&#x60;n127.0.0.1&#x60;t&quot; $ytDomains &#x3D; @() # string array of domains I found here: https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications/youtube # cant list them, as previous post was removed because some are url shorteners foreach ($site in $ytDomains){ Add-Content -Path $env:windir\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value &quot;$($baseEntry)$($site) www.$($site)&quot; -Force } ipconfig /flushdns nbtstat -R

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is the correct sub for this, but maybe.
 my business has become the target of someone who is repeatedly autodialing our primary reception phone number. we block the number that&#x27;s coming up as call ID, but then the attacker changes the number and starts again. Our phone provider (a voip pbx provider using voip.ms as their trunk) says they are not able to identify the original number but have confirmed the numbers are spoofed. The attacker calls periodically and berates the receptionist looking for some information that we don&#x27;t have, and has told her they will jam up our switchboards until we give them the information. This has been going on for about 3 weeks. The caller has said they are in south africa, though the numbers they call from are 10 digit north american numbers. My receptionist took it on herself to give the attacker some fake information that she thought might satiate them, but it was quickly identified as false and seemed to enrage them further.
 I discussed this with the RCMP (canadian police force) and they were able to call to one of the numbers that the attacker had called from and speak to them and told them to stop. However that was about as effective as you&#x27;d expect. The RCMP said there was nothing additional that they could do and to contact the anti-fraud division (which I&#x27;m going to be doing today with limited expectations for success)
 So, given that I am not able to block the calls as the call ID keep changing and my phone provider isn&#x27;t able to identify the actual source of the calls in order to provide to law enforcement, what options remain?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been with a company that I&#x27;ve been very committed to for a number of years. The pay was ok, the commute was short, and it&#x27;s a top tier position for the rural area I live in.
 And for the last two years I&#x27;ve been actively recruited for a Senior Network/Systems Engineer position with a tech firm who has high margins and a small number of employees. I&#x27;ll be next in line to the CTO- with a clear path to his position.
 The nature of this company is that they do not really have much other than technical employees- and I&#x27;m running the show.
 It&#x27;s also a very good paying gig.
 And while this is the best move for me there&#x27;s an emotional component I&#x27;ve not not really felt before.
 There&#x27;s no red flags or misgivings... but a lot of sadness. I more or less rescued the company from technical oblivion and built out fault tolerant systems which have really paid off.
 I&#x27;m going to miss my day today at this company. The people I can still have a relationships with.
 It was hard to see real sadness in the CEOs eyes when I gave him notice.
 Then there&#x27;s the excitement of the new position. Lots of perks. Underground parking. Working with a strong competent team. 
 And yet- even though I am leaving my current position for all the right reasons.. I still feel sad.
 It&#x27;s a big change.... and off we go.

                              <span>Good Morning:
 I am a SysAdmin* for a services company that has a workforce that changes frequently as it is contract based. We can go from 150 workers to 600+ in a matter of hours. As such, we are primarily in the &quot;cloud&quot; using virtualization services.
 Nonetheless, we still have a a physical HQ and a handful of full-time employees that require hardware. We are about to dump our MS and will be facing a situation wherein we will not have a means of safely/reliably obtaining the limited amount of hardware we occasionally need. We have tried Amazon with mixed to terrible results (and, honestly, we would be loathe to reveal this during an ISO audit) and companies like CDW are too rich for our blood, and companies like DELL and HP are not all that interested in entering into a lease program as we are very small potatoes. 
 So, do any of y&#x27;all have suggestions? It is important the source is reliable and on the up and up as we are ISO compliant and would like to keep it that way.
 Thank you!

                              <span>We have a secure site (HTTPS) self-hosted. GoDaddy handles the DNS. 
 What we want to happen is if a user enters http://{domain}.com/, https://{domain}.com/ or http://www.{domain}.com/ we want it to redirect the user to https://www.{domain}.com/.
 Currently if a user enters http://{domain}.com/ it redirects to https://{domain}.com/ and if a user enters http://{domain}.com/ it redirects to https://www.{domain}.com/
 How can we get all 3 of the other domains to redirect to the https://www version of the site?

                              <span>I read an article once that memory is handled differently in Windows 10 between a machine shutdown and a machine restart. A Windows 10 machine shutdown will cache memory. A restart starts from scratch. No power flows. No memory.
 Regarding VMs. Is the behavior the same? Does memory truly reset?
 I have a data archive on a proprietary time series database that is telling me it needs help. I cycled the server yesterday morning and it is still complaining. My gut tells me there is a flag on the file somewhere that I need to reset. I&#x27;m looking for it. Can&#x27;t find a KB on it though.
 As always thank you for your time. This is really a helpful community. My IT department isn&#x27;t always as motivated as I need them to be. I get more replies to my questions on this sub than I get replies to my emails.

                              <span>So i&#x27;m at a loss as to what to do about a fingerprint issue we&#x27;re experiencing. We&#x27;ve previously enabled Windows Hello for Business and everything has been working great for probably a year now. 
 Now, all of a sudden the fingerprint readers are being super weird. They will work right after a reboot just fine, but after some time goes by when you next go to login it just doesn&#x27;t act like you&#x27;ve touched the fingerprint reader at all. However, after unlocking with the password and then immediately locking the pc again it works perfectly! But if some time goes by... same non responsive issue. It does not give any failure messages.. just acts like it hasn&#x27;t been touched.
 I have disabled usb selective suspend, disabled the pc from turning the device off to save power within device manager. Uninstalled antivirus, fully went through windows updates, updated all gpo policies with the newest templates and double checked them to make sure nothing changed. I&#x27;ve also made sure domain controllers were up to date on updates.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? It seems to be domain wide as it&#x27;s not just one pc and it&#x27;s the exact same symptoms on everyone of them.

                              <span>Periodically, DNS entries for some of our servers that have static IP addresses disappear. We do have scavenging enabled for the default of 7 days for the No-Refresh Interval and the Refresh Interval. I&#x27;m assuming this is what&#x27;s removing them. My understanding from Microsoft is that &quot;Windows computers that are statically configured for TCP/IP try to dynamically register host address (A) and pointer (PTR) resource records.&quot; And, &quot;Windows registers A and PTR resource records every 24 hours regardless of the computer&#x27;s role.&quot; So if these servers are supposed to register every 24 hours, I don&#x27; understand why they&#x27;re being scavenged. Are there specific logs that can help me troubleshooting this? I&#x27;ve looked through event viewer but didn&#x27;t find anything helpful.

                              <span>So for a long time people were grousing that there&#x27;s some slowness on the network, but we really could not pinpoint the exact cause of it.
 Last week the financial department complained that their financial program keeps on bombing out. So I decided to step in this week and try to find the cause of this issue for once and for all.
 Everything networking at their workstations was replaced. Flyleads was tested prior to being installed, and yet the problem persisted.
 A couple of tests later, and everything pointed to either a network cable fault issue or something on the core switch.
 Today we got in the &quot;expert&quot;. He followed my test steps, and agreed that there is something funky going on, it either is the cabling or the core switch.
 So off to the server room we toddled, and do a few more tests on the switch. Same results.
 So we decided to reboot the switch by pulling power and bring it back on. He wanted to warn the people, but I know that people will just be dragging out the reboot because they have &quot;important&quot; things to do. Like finish watching that youtube clip with the hot chick, or do some work on their important resume. So... power was pulled. Future me won&#x27;t be pleased with myself should it come back to bite my a$$.
 Switch rebooted - and the one blade did not come back up. Found the fault, yay.
 But it also cut out the internet because our CPE was connected to that specific blade. Took a little juggling around of cables, but we got everything up again.
 Now we will have to wait for a replacement blade, but in the meantime things should be OK for now.
 And the good news is, that slowness is now gone.
 I t was bound to pop sooner or later anyway, better that it popped whilst the expert was there.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s a longshot, but do any of you use Solarwinds to monitor APC/Cyberpower devices? Our parent company just added these to the Solarwinds instance, but do not actually monitor anything &quot;power related&quot; (outlet usage, voltage in/out, etc). All they show is historical availability, ping/packet loss, and basic device info.
 I was wondering...
  
What options exist for monitoring these types of devices? (electricity, ping, connected devices, etc)
 What do you specifically look at?
 Anything else I should be aware of?

I&#x27;ve tried speaking to Webroot support but so far we haven&#x27;t really gotten anywhere, has anyone else had any luck with resolving this? This has happened on both servers and workstations and is becoming a much more annoying problem every day.

                              <span>Hi all
 We&#x27;re evaluating a software program and one of the recommended specs is related to resolution. 1680x1050 resolution with 32-bit color support. 
 I understand that the specs on the monitors need to show 16.7 million colors. Where I&#x27;m confused is what spec do I need to look at for the graphics card in a laptop or desktop pc. For example, when looking at a laptop that comes with 
 Intel UHD Graphics 630
 and 
 i5-10500T processor,
 nowhere on the intel specs page do I see anything related to 16.7 million colors or 32-bit color.
 Intel Core i510500T Processor 12M Cache up to 3.80 GHz Product Specifications 
 If anyone can point me in the right direction, I&#x27;d really appreciate it. 
 Thanks in advance.

 https://ibb.co/vL1g3Ys
 This is a diagram to illustrate my thought.
 I have heard of KVM but it looks a bit expensive.
 Is there such a switch that share a docking station between two computers?

During the day they send perfectly fine but for some reason in the later afternoon service drops off, sends emails to the delay send box. Not really sure what or why this would occur during a specific time of the day but seems to also be effecting only executive staff but also have not had the time to ask other individuals in the company on our network.

 Thanks again for any help on this guys! love this sub.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am having an issue with one of our customers (work in an MSP).
 On their host server (win svr 16 std) they have a data drive where they only have some VM VHDX files stored. Windirstat reports that approx. 850 GB is being used.
 But Windows reports that there is 204GB free of2.17TB.
 We are unable to find what is causing this disparity.
 We initially thought the issue was due to shadow copies from their anti-virus, but we&#x27;ve deleted all the shadow copies and it only cleared a small amount of space. Shadow copies are now set to only use 10% of each drive. There was an issue with the previous version of the AV client that would fill the drive with shadow copies, however this was resolved in the latest patch.
 We believe that there is still space allocated to, or hidden shadow copies, however windows reports that only approx. 90gb is used for shadow copies.
 We&#x27;re stumped on this one, any ideas? Has anyone seen this before.
 Happy to provide more info where I can.

I am a member of the proper groups, compliance, records, and organization management. I&#x27;ve tried rebuilding the index database but it keeps failing. I even tried enabling TLS1.0 like a different online post said but it didn&#x27;t work as well.

 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>I thought you folks might be interested in an email scam I received yesterday; an email that said I had an outstanding invoice that needed to be paid from PayPal.
 Now I obviously this tripped my scam senses, but it had made it to my inbox through google&#x27;s spam stuff and I couldn&#x27;t immediately work out how it was a scam, the email appeared genuine, it did actually come from PayPal, it had passed SPF, DKIM etc, all links went to genuine PayPal URLs.
 It was then I realised what the scammers had done.
 PayPal lets you use them for invoicing, if you have a PayPal business account (or more likely if scammers have access to a compromised PayPal business account) you can go &quot;Create me an invoice, send it to this email address, with this information in it&quot;
 They raised a real invoice for $500 and in the information where you&#x27;re supposed to put details about the invoice they had just put &quot;This money will be invoiced immediately, If you wish to contact us about this charge, please phone xxx xxxx xxx&quot;, at which point you end up with a scam call centre who will work you through some sort of banking refund scam like you see on Kitboga, Jim Browning and Mark Rober et al.
 But for all intents and purposes, this looks like a real email that has genuinely come from PayPal, because it really has genuinely come from PayPal.
 One to watch out for.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve been tasked to take over from an older gentleman who has left the environment in a huge mess.
 Basically we have a local office which has 3 subnets (country A - HQ):
 - Corp LAN- Corp WIFI- Server
 Country B:- Corp LAN- Corp WIFI
 Country C:- Corp LAN- Corp WIFI
 Countries A through C all have their DHCPs via Windows Server.
 To pass compliance, he - manually enters EACH machine&#x27;s MAC address for WIFI and LAN (DHCP reservation) - so giving the illusion that - you can&#x27;t plug your personal machine onto corporate network - when we all know - MAC address cloning is a way to bypass.
 The problem comes when people travel between countries and can&#x27;t connect to network, so he adds their MAC to that country&#x27;s DHCP server
 So the question to my fellow sysadmins, what solutions / products are there on the market to make this less painful to manage?

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Really quick one. Looking to potentially setup NPS with the Azure MFA Extension but hearing rumours it&#x27;s going to be going End Of Life in the near future. Can anyone confirm? Documentation and support on the NPS with MFA seems to be patchy at best so if it&#x27;s going to be potentially pulled may look into alternative solutions.

                              <span>KYIV, Ukraine — With Ukraine scrambling to keep communication lines open during the war, an army of engineers from the country’s phone companies has mobilized to help the public and policymakers stay in touch during repeated Russian missile and drone strikes.
 The engineers, who typically go unseen and unsung in peacetime, often work around the clock to maintain or restore phone service, sometimes braving minefields to do so. After Russian strikes took out the electricity that cellphone towers usually run on, they revved up generators to keep the towers on.
 “I know our guys — my colleagues — are very exhausted, but they’re motivated by the fact that we are doing an important thing,” Yuriy Dugnist, an engineer with Ukrainian telecommunications company Kyivstar, said after crunching through…</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 Is there anyone in possession of an active McAfee Endpoint Product Removal tool?
 I have loocked everywhere for it and the only version i found wa expired in 2020. There is another option to get this tool but you need a Grant number to get access to it and i dont know where the Grant number is located or if i have it as these laptops of witch im trying to remove them from is from a company that doesnt have any knowledge of the installation or agreement qith McAfee.
 I have tried with the support team but they dont seem to be helpful.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>HI all
 Sorry if this is not the place to post this
 I have been asked to look into getting a new server for the CCTV we have. We use Avigilon with HIKvison cameras, the server will need to work for 75 cameras and keep 14 days of footage.
 We don&#x27;t have the funds to get one from Avigilon they&#x27;re not cheep 
 The current server is showing its age, it&#x27;s a Xeon E3-1220v5 with 8GB and 16TB of storage (H730 card) from Avigilon look like so kind of dell server i think.
 i have no idea what makes a good CCTV server so any help will be grate 
 thanks M

 It should be doable to add some lines to ignore all of the security stuff?
 I know it&#x27;s far from best practise but I just need it to work for few more months.

                              <span>Hello,
 my company acquired a customer who is using Lotus Domino 9 with no absolute intention to switch to other products (Exchange Online, etc...).
 We use Veeam Backup &amp; Replication to make backups and replicas of the entire virtualized infrastructure (hypervisor is VMware).
 I spoke with the company who manages Lotus Domino and they told me that almost all backup products are not compatibile with LD databases i.e. even Veeam can fail to backup it through VSS causing inconsistencies when restoring data. According to this company, the only ways to make it work are: 
  
update to LD v12 that has some internal features to manage backups.
 use Veeam with batch scripts to stop LD services at the beginnning of the job and to make them start at the end
  
This customer have an ancient backup software, Symantec Backup Exec 2012, that used to backup the LD database but right now is not working. I know nothing about LD and I know this is a hell of a situation.
 Still, I wanted to know what do you do in these cases, do you know a software that works with LD DBs? What is it your experience with LD DBs?

 02:30 &quot;Um, it&#x27;s down at Microsoft per https://portal.office.com/servicestatus&quot;
 Kind of curious why they call it Teams (Consumer) but I presume it includes our Teams since it is down and we&#x27;re down.
 Oh what is this email from our Network &amp; Firewall guys about one of our ISPs (Spectrum) accidentally turned off our circuit but it&#x27;s back up? Not related to this since Teams is pinned to Verizon currently but let me do some stuff to verify everything is OK. It is.
 03:00 Time to go back to bed...oh, Teams status has turned green. Light me double check. Ru-roh, we&#x27;re still down. curl -vk https://teams.microsoft.com is getting resets. Works from home to the same IP address.
 Fire up tcpdump on our outbound ISP load balancers (link controllers)...yep, we&#x27;re receiving RST packets from Microsoft -- i.e. they&#x27;re actively rejecting us for some reason sigh
 Should I mention we have zero, zilch, no access to our tenant and need to engage $corporateOverlords whose native language is not English for any information regarding anything hosted by Microsoft?
 Reconfigure the load balancer to send Teams traffic out our generic outbound Verizon IP instead of the one that is dedicated to Teams...we&#x27;re back up. 
 Email boss to tell him $corporateOverlords will need to look up the logs or contact Microsoft for an explanation.
 03:30 Ok, let&#x27;s see if I can unwind and catch some sleep...

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 As some time did pass by since the Broadcom acquisition of VMWare, some of you did eventually move over to another product.
 ​
 ​
 I am still evaluating:
 XCP-ng
  
Offers 24/7 Enterprise support
 Has some performance limitations with single-threaded storage processes
 No application aware backups
 Active community
 Very responsive developer-team
  
​
 Proxmox
  
VERY limited enterprise support (austrian business hours)
 Very flexible storage backend support
 No application aware backups
 Active community
  
​
 I think, backups are an important point, that is not great for both solutions. A solution with limited enterprise support 
 ​
 What are your thoughts?
 ​
 Best wishes

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at some previous collegues work history to see what paths they took and it feels like I have somehow had an unfair advantage and have moved up in my career much faster than others, yet I feel incredibly average and potentially below. Has anyone else felt this way? It&#x27;s like imposter syndrome but only because I&#x27;m doing better than some others.
 I can usually find the answer to any problem or work with the right people effectively to solve most issues but I feel like I&#x27;m lazy, I make mistakes, I don&#x27;t go after certifications, I don&#x27;t homelab, I have lukewarm social skills, I&#x27;m not amazing at interviews, I don&#x27;t network very well, my written skills are average at best, I can&#x27;t clearly state my thoughts to executives, and sometimes I&#x27;m just overall inefficient at my job. 
 Yet I know I&#x27;m capable of doing my current job without a doubt, but I worry about being replaced by someone better constantly.
 So when I see someone stuck in a T1 job for like 4 years, it makes me question whether or not I deserve to be in IT Manager role after only 6 years. It makes me think I&#x27;ve just relied on luck or white privilege this whole time.
 This is by no means bragging. I just want to know if anyone has felt this way before?

 First off, the only support our IT department will provide is rack space in uni server room, 23x7x365 power for any servers, and gigabit internet. Our attempts to get more help has/have been fruitless. So as a bioinformatician a.k.a pretty much the only people aware of computing in our department.
 We have the opportunity to upgrade our server infrastructure. Will be used predominantly for NGS (Exome + genome) data (No ML yet, but would like to keep options open).
 There is no fixed budget to work with - generally the lower the better. For the sake of post, lets consider 10 lakh INR (~12k USD) as the maximum budget.
 Usage - There are 3 bioinformaticians who use the servers, mainly for processing research WES/WGS data, but also running analysis us…</span>

                              <span>I know every environment is nuanced but what’s the simplest, cleanest way to offboard users? I’d love to be able to permanently retain departed c-suite data (email and OneDrive) while freeing up licensing, rest of staff data retained for a set time without licensing. Who out there has great automations in place that tend to these things in a systematic way where no one is having to log when user accounts can be unlicensed and/or deleted? What policies do you enforce to make the whole offboarding process simple, clear, and streamlined?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hello.
 I&#x27;m planning on making some changes on a network, because we are short on ports.
 I have 2x Layer 3 core switches as cluster.
 There is very little inter-vlan routing on it.
 ​
 However, I have a lot of servers that are connected with SFP modules.
 To avoid having to additionally buy 2x very expensive layer 3 core switches, I would like to buy 2x layer 2 switches with 24 SFP ports for the servers.
 I would then connect them redundantly to the core switches as distribution layer.
 ​
 At least that was my idea.
 However, I can&#x27;t find any Layer 2 switches with more than 4 SFP ports at all.
 Do such devices even exist, and if not, why?

                              <span>I&#x27;m walking our property with a fiber vendor and two of our closets have multimode patch cables to the access switches but the actual fiber run to the patch panel is single mode.
 We&#x27;ve had probably 30+ accesses switches with multimode fiber running without issues for longer than I&#x27;ve been here. No errors or oddities I&#x27;ve seen on the connections. 
 To test this, I did hook up a switch using single mode optics/fiber and sure enough it connected. No errors on the port etc.
 Does anyone know the technical reason this works? I would assume there would be bigger issues due to the diameter size of the cabling differences?
 edited for some clarity.

 I&#x27;ve worked with computers in many different ways for well over two decades. I use Linux at home, proxmox for my home serving needs, I wrote my companies entire ERP system from scratch that connects with thermal label printers, QR code generation, time management, inventory management etc. all of it on the LAMP stack ... I am familiar with technology.
 Enterprise networking is a bit of black box to me though and I am trying to make some changes to the systems here and am confused whether or not I truly don&#x27;t understand professional grade networking OR the people who built out the network here are complete idiots. 
 Please help me figure out which is which.

                              <span>I have to run a coax line and I am need some advice on the specs of the cable I should use and what to expect for performance.
 We are getting 1000 Mb/s cable internet dropped to a pole on the property and it will be my responsibility to bring it into the building and get it to the network cabinet.
 There is an existing 3/4 underground conduit that I will be using which might limit me to RG6 rather than RG11.
 The run will be around 150&#x27; of underground conduit and then 150&#x27; of running inside the building to the network cabinet.
 Will 300&#x27; of coax cable potentially give me loss issues? Am I overthinking this, can I just grab a 300&#x27; roll of RG6 copper clad steel cable from Home Depot and send it? 
 I also have the option of putting the cable modem in the building right where the coax enters and then go with 150&#x27; cat6 back to the cabinet but I&#x27;d like to avoid this option as I would much rather keep the modem with all the other network stuff.
 Any advice?

                              <span>I live in sweden and we have &quot;city networks&quot; which are owners of the fibre network municipaly and the middle man between customer and ISPs
 The city network in my are assigns a Vlan per customer which easily adds up to over 4096. They do this so the can authenticate every users traffic to a RADIUS server which returns what ISP that customer has a contract with ( which also allows us to choose between many diffrent ISPs). 
 What i was wondering is what they use to make sure they have enough Vlans. Double/tripple tagging or Q-in-Q? If so which would be more efficent for a network running up to 200 000 Vlans? 
 Wouldn&#x27;t a tagging method use up a lot of processing power to tag/untag
 Does anyone have experience with these kinds of network structures?

                              <span>I am working on a design proposal to connect multiple customer&#x27;s networks to AWS using IPSEC S2S VPNs. This is straightforward for the most part. Establish VPN tunnels between AWS and the router. I am wondering if an alternative design might work where we configure a device (such as a Juniper SRX320 -- but open to other device suggestions) and ship it out to the customer with instructions to plug cable A into a network with internet access (such as a guest network) and cable B into the target network. Can the device behave as a standard client on the B interface (including receiving a DHCP address) but still allow AWS traffic to access devices on the network without being the default gateway for that network? The reason for this approach is it would simplify establishing VPN connections for customers as they would simply have to plug a device in instead of adding VPN configuration to their router.

I been studying for 4 years now, I been working net eng 1.5 years, i worked in 3 top companies in their relative industry on the country level, so i consider my self very lucky to start from startline with being network engineer, currently im sr. Net eng, i been in this position for 4 months it&#x27;s really boring, my whole career i worked on countless projects none of them are complex all of them were too basic for my taste, I&#x27;m really good network engineer i got the companies i worked in out of huge jams faster than most sr. Net engs there with 10+ years experience, my current job took boring to another level, i really started losing interest in networking, I&#x27;m thinking maybe i will get in pen testing starting with OSCP i already have solid networking and programming knowledge, but just in case i find 3-5 years from now i made a mistake, can i get back to networking? Will it be possible without getting my salary jabed?

                              <span>We have an MPLS circuit which terminates into our core switch (Cisco Nexus) via ethernet. On our Nexus, we have an IP assigned to the ethernet port plugs into.
 I recently added a second Nexus and connected it to the original via vPC. We will not add a second MPLS link to this switch, but would like to add it as a BGP peer to the carrier. Is there a best practice or suggested &quot;port&quot; to configure the IP address used for peering in this scenario?

                              <span>IPSec tunnel connection will only establish if the tunnel is restarted. It stays connected if there is traffic. Without traffic for a certain amount of time the connection is lost, although the tunnel still shows connected. We are waiting for the other site to add an IP for tunnel monitoring, but I am curious if anyone here has any ideas for what could be happening.
 Edit: something to add are this is a PAN connecting to SonicWall, but we are already setup for Proxy ID&#x27;s.

 But what I don&#x27;t know is can I still purchase the -R / -IR licenses for it?

                              <span>Hi,
 Let&#x27;s say I want to bind my server so that it ONLY listens on my subnet, and not accessible via public IP. If it is bound to 0.0.0.0 then it would bind to all available adresses, but I would like it to bind to the LAN IP only. If I already know my Local IP then that is easy enough, but it can change due to DHCP. I am testing this on a python3 simpleHttpServer like this
 python -m http.server 8080 --bind 192.168.0.0/24
 But this does not work. Is this a limitation of this python module?

 We have a /22 of ipv4 addresses that we no longer need and I am wondering if interlir.com and other similar platforms actually work or if there is any actual demand for these subnets? 
 Does anyone have any experience with leasing out ipv4 subnets?

 ​
 There is &quot;show route next-hop X.X.X.X&quot; but that only show routes with specific next-hop that are best paths as per bgp path selection and get installed in rib. What if you wanted to show all received bgp routes (best or not best) that have the next-hop X.X.X.X? Can this be done without grepping or using include through a full bgp table?

 Please advise about the design
 current design is a leaf border design

                              <span>Hello there, I have a PC connected to the internet and then another lan network that is offline for security purposes. So far passing files from one to another is done using usb drives. I was thinking of connecting the PC with the internet to one of the PCs in the offline network and use a simple ftp server using Python scripts to automate this process. 
 Now the question is, will that beat the purpose of the &quot;offline&quot; lan network security? Is there any standard way of keeping the Internet and the lan network fully seperate, like transfer the files ONLY through the python script and keep the lan network invisible from the Internet. Or no matter what I do, there will always be vulnerabillities and the 2 networks can&#x27;t be truly seperate once a there is a wired connection between them?

 I was wondering how to resolve this issue
 Summary: server is receiving the syn packet but is not responding with syn/ack packets
 I have already checked the following:
  
Ports are listening/open
 No iptables/firewalld/SELinux blocking the connection
 No changes to OS level prior to the issue.
  
I have been reading that turning off the TCP timestamp resolved this issue. However, I am concerned as this may have performance consequences. 
 Appreciate any response. Thanks!

                              <span>I have a NVR located in one building on the property, but I want to view the HDMI output of the NVR (NOT the networking output - When viewed over internet/network as the NVR is designed, I do not get the motion and recording icons on screen, the internal gui displays the icons on the local display but not over network viewing). I know there has to be some sort of hardware out there that I can connect and bing.... bam.... boom.... right? 
 The networking is via firewall via ISP, everything in these buildings are on the same network even tho we arent directly connected.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively certain I know the answer on this one, but wanted to get some outside confirmation - a type 2 route redistribution into OSPF will have a flat metric throughout the OSPF topology (1 if redistributing from BGP, 20 if redistributing from anything else, at least for Cisco&#x27;s implementation). 
 In contrast, for type 1 routes, the router doing the redistribution into OSPF doesn&#x27;t try to add any cost based on the protocol it&#x27;s being redistributed from. Say router XYZ is redistributing a static route to 5.5.5.0/24 as a type 1 route. Would it be correct to say that other OSPF routers in the topology calculate the metric for 5.5.5.0/24 based on their cost to reach router XYZ, and that router XYZ&#x27;s perceived metric to reach 5.5.5.0/24 doesn&#x27;t matter (static routes seem to have a &quot;metric&quot; in show ip route of 0 anyway)? If you had your reference bandwidth set to 10g, it wouldn&#x27;t matter if the static route to 5.5.5.0/24 had a next-hop address associated with an interface running at 10g, 1g, or 100m; the OSPF topology is only considering the cost to reach router XYZ, and router XYZ won&#x27;t try to artificially inflate the OSPF cost if the bandwidth on that interface changes.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m sort of looking at where to start here. I&#x27;m doing some labbing and want to set up a network that utilizes some VPNS that will be using certificates for the user and device authentication. Most all of my experience is simply with shared secrets. I&#x27;ve gone through security training and know what most of the components of PKI are individually, and I&#x27;ve generated certs in small projects before. However, getting an idea of how this infrastructure would be built and maintained well is kind of beyond me. 
 ​
 Can anyone recommend some good resources to go through that would give me a good idea of what I need to build up, and how it would all sort of function together? It seems like it&#x27;s that odd part that isn&#x27;t networking but plenty of times it&#x27;s our responsibility.

                              <span>This is my 3rd year as a network engineer. Worked two years in public transport where it was wild. Nothing was standard, alerting all over the place, I got to do all sorts of cool things. Worked on my own automation projects, build redundancy in for offices, actually saw things that could be improved, proposed the solutions and was given the green light. Felt I was actually contributing and making a difference, it was hectic however it was also fun.
 I ended up quitting in august 2021 to study and travel. Got my CCNP and got a job at a large financial company. Everything here is so dialed in that I ssh into a device maybe twice a week. Haven’t even needed a console cable cause our OOB is setup well. Everything is automated, alerting on point and Im realizing how green I am because I have zero ideas of how to improve anything. I find myself only really sending emails, working with vendors to get gear, ISPs to get circuits, plan office expansions and never ending meetings. I feel I don’t actually do any networking stuff. Spoke to my manager about this and he said ‘welcome to being a senior engineer….’ Not only am I in no way a senior but is this really the future of this career path? I am finding it so boring and have none of that tinkering/ trying to get something to work. 
 I understand my job is to provide reliable network access, but holy hell is it boring when it all works well…..

                              <span>I am trying to build a sub interface on our Cisco XR like this (cli):
 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/0.3106 description test vrf testvrf ipv4 address 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.254 encapsulation dot1q 3106 
 Seems straightforward enough, but I have been down the yang road before and its actually not as straightforward as I would think.
 How does one go about actually building a netconf xml based yang model for this? From what I understand you need to determine which yang structures should be used to build your xml netconf from. I found that the openconfig interface yang model does everything I need except applying a vrf to the interface. Then I found Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-cfg, however this yang model has way more settings its not very clear how I use this model properly to create the above interface…</span>

                              <span>**EDIT** 
 We took a capture from the F5&#x27;s during the failover. There is no ARP being sent from the PA. When an F5 BIG-IP fails over, it will GARP, finding the routers Gateway. This will fulfill the PA&#x27;s ARP table. After 30 minutes exactly (the ARP cache refresh timer) the PA will drop the entry because it will not send an ARP for the F5 virtual-server IP. Basically, we&#x27;re only seeing connectivity at failover due to the F5 GARP for the router&#x27;s Gateway IP. 
 Has anyone ever experienced a Palo Alto not sending ARP for a singular IP on a subnet before? Or, could someone maybe explain why this is happening?

                              <span>I have been building these pfsense boxes. I have never really had a need for high bandwidth IPsec threw-put before. 
 Now I am getting into needing it. But I cannot figure out what about a box determines the amount of bandwidth it is capable of. 
 Like CPU load can be very low and it will not pass that much traffic. Then looking at premade appliances it seems the cpu is not that important to the amount of threw-put a box is capable of. 
 So my question is, if the cpu is not doing the cyphering then what is?

 I am looking to move away from Unifi as I build out a new SMB. I was asked about Engenius and wanted to check here what do you all think about Engenius for the switch and APs? The SMB is very small and not looking at the HPC/Dell/Cisco price range of gear.
 Thanks

                              <span>Currently we have 3 FTD&#x27;s total in our network. 2 in a HA transparent in front of our firewalls to act strictly as a IPS. This was a impromptu solution to losing our IPS. The 3rd FTD is a routed firewall in our equinix location. Currently I have a rule on the FMC that says any zone any source any destination with the application Spotify set to Block. 
 I would figure that rules would follow the top down pattern and say if its not spotify traffic then move it along to the next rule. Instead whenever I do a packet tracer it hits that rule with a allow on about any piece of traffic I do... So basically its a permit ip any any. 
 What am I doing wrong ?

 Switch A (Contains VMWare Cluster1) --- Switch B (Contains VMWare Cluster2) --- Switch C (Core) --- Access switches
 An admin has requested all the VMWare hosts pass jumbo mtu. I understand I need to enable jumbo mtu on all VMW vswitches, switch A and switch B. My question is where do I stop ? I am thinking I should not enable jumbo MTU at the uplink from switch B -- switch C. Will this cause switch C to drop packets from switch B?

                              <span>Might be the wrong subreddit just firing this one off in the dark. My use case is that I have a giant pile of switches where in the MAC of the inband interface is one digit increase of the 10/100 MGMT interface. 
 Lets say the 10/100 ends 5D, the inband is 5E and so on. I only have in inventory the 10/100 mac for each switch, but I need to do a DHCP hardware reservation for the inband. Does anyone in the OUI realm know if the +1 integer HEX increase is standard industry wide? So if I have say a MAC ending in AF the next in line will be B0? What happens when you get to FF? Do vendors just increase the value in the next bit and then start at 00? I would assume they have to?

                              <span>So, taking a cursory glance at Zero Trust as a replacement for our current VPN setup. I get the security aspect and how it does more to authenticate users and devices than just saying &quot;Oh you&#x27;re on the domain? You&#x27;re good.&quot; However, it seems to be purely security. I don&#x27;t see how it actually connects you to the network? It looks more like something you would use in tandem with a VPN, but everyone talks about it as a one or the other type of thing.

                              <span>I am having an issue with the BGP failover and trying to find the best way to solve it. Topology is here: https://ibb.co/myN4xXn
 I did not design this network, I inherited it. My knowledge of BGP is shallow but I used it successfully in many simple networks.
 Site 2 uses Site 1&#x27;s ExpressRoute to reach Azure when MPLS and Site 1&#x27;s ExpressRoute are available. When not site 2 uses direct site to site VPN tunnel to reach Azure. Failover and failback work correctly when MPLS fails, but I am running into issues when ExpressRoute fails. When ExpressRoute fails Site 1 still advertises routes to Site 2 because it learns them through Site 1&#x27;s site to site VPN. I don&#x27;t want that.
 Site 2 uses weight to prioritize &quot;MPLS&quot; over Site to Site VPN to Azure. In Azure I am pre-pending AS to make one path less desirable.
 What I simply want to do is prevent Site 1 from advertising Azure routes to site 2 when they are learned through Site to Site VPN, but for some reason I can&#x27;t wrap my head on how to do that. I know I need to use a route-maps to do it, but how to configure the route map and where to apply it is the question.
 Conceptually I think I need to first tag/identify routes when they are learned through site to site VPN Azure BGP neighbor, and then I need to deny those routes from being advertised to site 2.
 Right now I am using same route-map on site 1 for both Azure BGP neighbors. I think I will need to split that and use different route-map for each neighbor. 
 It seems that I can use &quot;community&quot;, &quot;origin&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;, and &quot;route-tag&quot; to make routes from one neighbor different than others.
 On premise equipment are FortiGate firewalls and ideally I like to make all changes on them. I want to avoid, if possible, to make changes in Azure.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got a branch with a single core switch, and an HA firewall pair (yeah, I know). I want to implement the below design, where the core switch would be connected with trunk ports to the INSIDE interfaces of both firewalls, then the OUTSIDE interfaces would come back to the core switch on access ports on VLAN X, and we connect to the ISP on an access port on VLAN X. We do &quot;sw mode access&quot; and &quot;sw nonegatiate&quot; on those OUTSIDE switch interfaces and, of course, prune VLAN X from the trunks to mitigate VLAN attacks.
 https://www.ccexpert.us/firewall-config/switch-2.html
 I have been told by my colleagues that our IA people will freak out, and will not accept having the INSIDE and OUTSIDE networks on the same hardware. Does anyone know of any documentation, or design guides, or proof of concepts from reputable sources that I can take to convince them this is a secure design?
 Conversely, if someone knows a specific exploit that makes this unsecure, please share.

 NOTE: Red is the attackers IP, Black my local IP (redacted due to privacy).
 I also had to rename the wireshark.exe, since the virus won&#x27;t run if Wireshark is open.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I’m a networking engineer with 9 years of experience, I have a bachelor degree and I a lot of minor networking certifications (Meraki, Sophos, Aerohive(now extreme), Mojo(Now Arista)).
 Also I’m good with automation and I feel comfortable with programming languages.
 I’ve been designing enterprise networks a lot of years but I think I need to move to the next step in my career.
 Which certifications or moves you think I must take in order to get to the next level?
 Kind regards!

                              <span>Hoping this community has a solution for our need. We run a network on a military installation for personal use internet connectivity. We need a means to test internet speeds at about 10 buildings of the 200 we are connected via cable, switches and PTP radios. We have a 1Gb broadband connection which we give soldiers 50 down and 2 up. Last year we decided to try it with Raspberry pi4’s but they seem impossible to get our hands on anymore. We did get 2 last year and loaded with speedtest cli. We distributed these to two buildings and it works flawlessly. Getting old laptops or old pc’s running in attics would work but I’m looking for something small like a raspberry that I can plug into a switch in an attic get my stats and dump them into g drive. Or perhaps there is a small IOT device that is purpose build to do that. I’m trying to stay in raspberry pricing per unit. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey guys, long time lurker short time poster - forgive me for formatting. We have a strange issue TAC support are taking weeks to resolve (even as a P2 ticket), I wondered if anyone else has experienced this issue. 
 We have 250 APs, around 12 of those are R500 the rest R510. These are connected to a vSZ controller with non-proxied radius requests. A couple times a day, the entire cluster will drop connections and no one regardless of PSK SSID or an 802.1x SSID can connect. In this time, you cannot SSH into an AP and invariably you cannot SSH into the vSZ either. Ruckus Support seem to be having problems pinpointing the issue in logs and have repeatedly asked for logs between 3-5 mins after the issue occurs. Our controller is running 6.1.0.0.935, R510 running 6.1.0.0.1595 and R500 5.2.1.0.1038 
 We see a lot of AP-Disconnected events along with RADIUS server unreachable at the time of the incident. Has anyone experienced this issue themselves?

                              <span>The issue: accessing hp.com (just an example) from Chrome. It&#x27;s not reachable. When I start Task Manager it&#x27;s go fine. I turn Task manager off and hp.com does not work anymore.
 What I did:
 Windows 10 updates
 Defender scan
 Uninstalled a lot of old or unrecognizable apps and services (using Services and Process Explorer)
 removed other active user (postgre) through PowerShell
 ​
 ESET Online Scanner (full scan)
 Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool
 Emsisoft Emergency Kit (full scan)
 ESET SysInspector

 Have not notice any CPU or GPU idle activity through Process Explorer

 OS reinstall is an easiest solution but that is not an option now.
 ​
 This is just a desktop without local network.
 What else I can check to track why PC acts like this.
 ​
 PS. Also, there are 2 wifi routers in cascade with 2 different NATs. This is happening for a main router (which is connected to modem). When switching wifi to secondary wifi router (connected to LAN port of primary router) than issue disappear.

                              <span>I have 2 domains, exchange server in 1 domain A that handles email for both A and B AD domains, but all users re behind the same @company.com. It&#x27;s been fine for few years as-is, as was the user. I now have that 1 user that is constantly being locked out in AD and the source is the email server, the user is in domain B. I have no clue if it matters... 
  
I deleted all of his activesync devices
 he only has 1 issued company smartphone and I deleted the email on there
 I recreated his outlook profile on his desktop. 
 I&#x27;ve disabled his activesync access in ECP
 I&#x27;ve disabled OWA in ECP
  
Because of the 2 domains I use the linked AD accounts, but again, that has not been an issue in many years and it&#x27;s just 1 user being affected so I&#x27;m not inclined to think something else is messed up.
 wtf…</span>

                              <span>I took over Listserv administration about a year ago when I started my role as Sysadmin. It’s just a massive mess I’m trying to go through and cleanup inactive lists, etc. 
 We have a lot of issues specifically with Gmail having significant delays with delivery that were looked at by others in the role before me. Ultimately we want to get rid of Listserv as even their cloud option isn’t cheap. Are there any good alternatives out there others have used? I found Gaggle Mail, which sounds like a good potential replacement but I need to research it further.
 I’m curious to know other’s experience or if they’ve used something else.

I saw an opportunity to replace our current EDR (ESET) for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. However, I&#x27;m somewhat overwhelmed with all of the settings that can be set. The more I read, the deeper the rabbit hole seems to go. Note that this is for a small company that doesn&#x27;t have any industry-specific cyber security regulations though certain regulations are stipulated in the insurance we have for potential cyber attacks. There are some obvious settings that should be turned on, but I&#x27;m not finding any particular guides online for a minimum secure configuration. Anyone have any helpful resources?

                              <span>We don&#x27;t want to disable IPv6, but we want to disable systems requesting DHCP configuration over iPv6.
 I know it can be set by running a command on each system:
 Set-NetIPInterface -AddressFamily IPv6 -InterfaceIndex $(Get-NetIPInterface -AddressFamily IPv6 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InterfaceIndex) -RouterDiscovery Disabled -Dhcp Disabled
 However, if we did that, we would have no reporting or auditing showing the current status of each system.
 Is there a GPO or registry setting for Windows that accomplishes the same thing so that the configuration can be easily audited?

                              <span>I have been in IT for more than 25 years, and had about a dozen jobs in various companies/industries of different sizes. I never really liked IT, but was generally good at it and it paid well. The best jobs are when I had a fun team, worst have been from bad management. I eventually change jobs for whatever reason: company closing, management, bored, whatever. I have always thought about changing professions during my career, but I don’t know if I would feel better doing that or not. Or have any idea what I would do anyway. I don’t like the idea of continually changing jobs, especially in my 50s, I average about 2-3 years per job, but I am pretty sure I am not in the right place to finish my career in 15-20 years.
 I never felt fulfilled or proud of my career path, and dread mondays and going into the office 3 times a week, but the days go by quickly given that every day is different. All in all, things are ok, I’m hybrid, get paid well, little work outside my 40 hours, my management leaves me alone, I’ve always gotten good reviews when I had them. I don’t really connect with my team, and fear I would be released if layoffs come. Some days, it’s a struggle staying above water from both the complexity and quantity of work, most days I stare at the clock waiting for quitting time.
 For the most part I’ve been an admin: windows, linux, storage, virtualization, cloud, and dabbled a bit in of security, databases, scripting, networking. Not sure if I should stay where I am, switch to a similar job as admin, change to something like IT security , or change careers entirely.
 Where are you at? Experiencing the same feelings? Am I burnt out or being whiny?

                              <span>I troubleshoot hardware and software issues at every level of the support tiers. Sometimes when I am breaking down a box or something and it just will not cooperate in folding the way I want, I will yell at it.
 This seems to happen more on days when I have a tough troubleshoot. Maybe I am just getting grumpy in my old age...

                              <span>I find that I get along really great with my end users and I can explain most of the issues in layman&#x27;s terms but when working on a larger team of system engineers or very techy people they look at me like I am an idiot or I just do not mesh well with them.
 I had a job for three months with an MSP and none of the techs liked me there. I got fired due to culture fit. At my current job I am bashing with my bosses boss as well as an app consultant because I am asking questions or detailing the frustrations that the users have with our equipment and software when it seems like nothing is getting fixed.
 How do you learn how to keep your head down and work with technologies or even people you think are inferior? Is it the fact that I don&#x27;t have the knowledge that I think I do? Is it the politics of crappy workplaces? I have 8-10 years of IT exp and still generally help desk support at various roles/companies, could that be the reason? 
 Why do I think IT should be about investigating problems and making sure they get fixed and do not reoccur when in reality it is actually about putting bandaids on things until you can&#x27;t take it anymore and leave? I guess this is why they call hell desk hell. Even though I generally don&#x27;t have the problem with dealing with users like most people lolz.

                              <span>Hi guys. Our company is evaluating the transition from on prem servers to cloud servers, and I&#x27;d like to ask for your advice. Our current environment includes 2 sites while each site has 1 Windows server (to work as DC, DHCP and print server) + 1 Windows file server. GPOs are in place to mount network drives and printers. We also have NSA to work as firewalls and VPN connections for remote users.
 Our major plan is to replace the file servers with Nasuni edge appliances. That will bring us &#x27;small cache file server&#x27; to each location. But the executives are considering replacing the current DCs to cloud VM. 
 From my premature understanding of cloud resources, this looks possible by running a VM with site-to-site VPN connection to on prem networks. Remote users will still connect VPN before they could reach the DC for authentication. But would there be any issues/concerns for the features like AD, printing, DNS, GPO, etc.?

                              <span>Hey guys, the Intune environment of our company is quite messy, and we searched for a solution for a short while to help us with uncluttering it.
 This program uses the ms-graph api to get all the apps, configuration policies etc. and displays the result in a GUI. You can even export your findings.
 From a safety aspect u probably should get a c# programmer to look into it, before using it in your main tenant. But I tried it on our test tenant and it just worked. (and ofc I only gave the user I used a read-only role)

 This might really help other folks with cluttered environments, to find things that aren&#x27;t even used or assigned to anything, so I thought I share this discovery :)

 ​
 I have some printers in my Active Directory, and users are adding them through the directory. 
 ​
 When they are added, the server hosting the shared printers is generating MANY 4624 Event IDs, specifying &quot;An account was successfully logged on.&quot;, even if the users are not printing anything... 
 ​
 Is that some sort of connection status check ? And is there anyway to customize/disable it ?

 I do remember doing an Active directory cleanup a few weeks back but I do not know what is the account associated with the software. I can&#x27;t restore deleted accounts in Active Directory because our systems aren&#x27;t able to do that. 
 Here is the error:

                              <span>Morning,
 I was asked to take a look at the bill a customer is receiving from the local phone/internet company. I actually don&#x27;t know what is normal for these, I don&#x27;t typically see the bill, and was hoping for some help.
 They have dedicated fiber and there are two spots on the bill that lists our circuit number. I&#x27;ll alter the numbers slightly but leave the ratio between the two amounts.
 The first item says &quot;Dedicated Internet&quot; and is 800.00 That makes sense to me.
 The second line items says &quot;Megalink Port per DS1 Rental Period of 36&quot; and is 650.00
 Not sure what that second one is. Is that a rental for their gear? Is that normal? 
 We have the typical small box from the carrier with our circuit on it with the cables coming in from somewhere in the building to it with a Cat6 cable hanging off it we plug into our firewall. I hope we are not renting that.

                              <span>Good morning. I&#x27;m looking for a affordable image tool. I&#x27;d like to create one or two images that include all the apps we use, and then just deploy those with minor tweaks.
 All the tools I&#x27;ve seen are for endpoint management and are therefore expensive. We don&#x27;t need all that jazz.
 Are there affordable tools out there that you use? Seems like everyone wants $20/machine or $1000 a year.
 I readied 100 machines last year. Took too much time.
 I tried getting WDS/MDT going, and got about 90% there but am having authentication issues when it comes to accessing the share in WinPE.

 So far, my attempts to reach out to them directly have been unsuccessful. :(
 Edit: 
 As an example, DMARC Analyzer uses &quot;rep.dmarcanalyzer.com&quot; for their RUA ingestion, which is published in any customer&#x27;s DMARC record.

 Currently, I have Google Cloud Sync up and running syncing my domain users from our on-premise Active Directory to Google (so far so good!)
 Then I have setup Google Password Sync to sync the passwords for our users. 
  
I change password for a user in my AD
 The user can now sign in to admin.google.com fx
 The new password just set in the AD works, but after the user signed in it will instantly prompt users to change password again?
 I would want it to not prompt the user to change password online in Google after the password is set in the AD, does anybody have a clue on what setting to look at here :) ?

 I want to enroll Hybrid Azure AD Joined devices to Intune, but it is not working for some reason...The HAADJ devices already have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint pushed through GPO and these devices are showing up in Intune. In Azure AD, it says that the MDM used by the device is Intune but in the Endpoint Manager portal, it says MDE (Managed by column).
 My configuration looks good, but the devices still doesn&#x27;t get enroll in Intune because they have been MDE onboarded before.
 So, to go from MDE to a real Intune enrollment, do I need to wipe the device, or a better solution exist, I can&#x27;t find the solution...
 Thank you very much for the help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m enabling Windows Hello from Endpoint Manager using a Configuration Profile (so I can do a staggered deployment).
 When I add a user to the Configuration Profile it eventually asks them to reboot, then they try to login and it asks them to setup Windows Hello. Once they complete the setup they try and enter the PIN they just set and get “This option is currently unavailable” and they can only login with their domain password.
 After a bit of time the PIN suddenly starts working and I have no idea why.
 This is a hybrid environment so I suspect a password sync needs to happen before Windows Hello will work properly.

                              <span>Good day
 I have a client that has an engineer working from abroad. This person connects to a virtual machine on a server that shares an NVIDIA Tesla GPU to draw CAD models. If the engineer is on-site at the office, connection is established through a site-to-site VPN. If he works from home, he dials in to the main office through client VPN. Ping ranges from 200 to 250 ms.
 The performance of the virtual machine is sufficient, but since we are using RDP there are significant limitations to the user experience. Manipulating models or watching videos is - as you may expect - laggy and not very pleasant.
 I followed this manual and allowed H.264/AVC hardware encoding in the local group policies of the machine. There is a significant improvement compared to the regular RDP settins. Can you think of other ways to boost the user experience when working over RDP? How do I get the most out of this protocol? Thanks for all the suggestions.
 Before you bash me for this setup - it was not my idea - I inherited the setup from my predecessor.

                              <span>I have been given the following openvpn config exported from a pfsense machine along with the .p12 and .key files.

 So far (almost half a year) I&#x27;ve used to connect to the vpn by just providing a username and a password. Today When I tried to connect, it asked me also for private key password which I don&#x27;t know which it is. 
 Is there something need to be changed in the config due to some openvpn update or something is going bad?
 My openvpn version is :
 OpenVPN 2.5.8 [git:makepkg/0357ceb877687faa+] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [LZ4] [EPOLL] [PKCS11] [MH/PKTINFO] [AEAD] built on Nov 1 2022 library versions: OpenSSL 3.0.7 1 Nov 2022, LZO 2.10 
 Any idea is welcome. I&#x27;m asking here because a couple of months ago our IT has left the company :-/

 The ad agency has about 60 users. There is no central office location. Staff is using all sorts of software. Any approach to bring things together and stream line things?

 Everyone was super helpful on my last post - 👍.
 Just have a support ticket in regarding the LinkedIn Sales Navigator intergration for our CRM org. 
 Issue seems to be it isn&#x27;t loading some of the details when used in Outlook on the Web, but it&#x27;s fine on the app. Tried a few searches but not getting much specific to my case. Already tried basics like cache and ingonito etc.

 Thanks in advance everyone.

From what I&#x27;ve seen online i can just replace the boot.wim and install.wim files in order to do so. How can I format my USB stick into NTFS to put the image on as its 15GB as Windows PE automatically formats it to FAT32

                              <span>Just a strange thing we have noticed and had some feedback from Microsoft on.
 In the past when you gave Full Access to a users mailbox through the GUI in Exchange to another user this did not allow the delegate to see Private Items this was always an additional setting within Outlook that the user would have to set.
 It seems now this has changed and that when you assign a delegate to a mailbox through the GUI this also gives that delegate access to the Users Private Items.
 I should add this seems to only have changed recently on Cloud Exchange
 Microsoft have confirmed seemingly this is by design which has actually raised a big concern of privacy.
 Has anyone else had anything similar?

                              <span>Namely, a person that is either directly or indirectly a part of IT, but whose responsibilities lie in being copied in emails and dropping their boilerplate wisdom every now and then. Instead of working on problems/projects, they solve them by using Outlook (getting someone else to do it). 
 I’ve had a place where I worked with a person like this, but currently, due to no fault of my own (policies and procedures) I see myself becoming a mailman.
 Have you noticed this phenomena? How do you approach working with colleagues like this? And what steps do you take to remove yourself from that kind of position if you see yourself in it?

 Right now, my organization has a network printer IP address in the source parameter of the configured firewall rules to the network addresses of the corporate network and the action is allow.
 I need to explain this firewall rule to the stakeholders that this rule is dangerous and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed by default because by right printer or server should not be able to initiate a requests .
 Who do I explain better in words with risks so that they get it? I tried to google information but leads to dead end.
 All helps are appreciated, thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 we&#x27;re facing some issues. Currently we&#x27;re running AWS Managed Active Directory with Pass-Through Auth to M365. Now we need to enable Hybrid Azure AD join.
 I got the error not a member of Enterprise Admins group (yes, it&#x27;s a managed AD, so you have no Enterprise Admin).
 Then I tried the ConfigureSCP.ps1 Script which the MS Agents suggest -&gt; Access Denied.
 I tried to update schema via AWS Console -&gt; only in CN&#x3D;Schema....
 Any suggestions, or has anybody got it working?

                              <span>Currently trying to double down on some bad practises we have on company PCs. I have removed all users as local admins on their PC, due to users installing some applications which are not work related.
 Some of these users are Technicians which go on client sites to troubleshoot products, which require them to change their Laptop NIC Card IP Address and install drivers. 
 I have solved the NIC Card issue by including their AD account in the &#x27;Network Configuration Operators&#x27; Local Group on each of their PCs respectively.
 The driver install problem I can&#x27;t seem to wrap my head around. They only need to install drivers from a specific vendor, lets call them &#x27;Vendor A&#x27;.
 Is there a way to enforce a GPO on these users, which allows them to install applications and drivers by &#x27;Vendor A&#x27; only without the need of admin credentials, while asking for admin credentials for any other app/driver install?
 I have searched the web for a solution and found there is a way to have trusted and untrusted publishers in an AD, but wasn&#x27;t able to make it work as I need it. 
 This is for around 10 users running Windows 10, connected to an AD installed on windows server 2016. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>dude, where is my phone?
 This article is gonna be the first in a series about my current project, taking a current-gen flagship phone beyond the mainstream schools of customization. I want a phone making good on all the vendor promises, I want mine not just to deliver all the cool features they were showing off in the commercial, I need mine to also respect my privacy and be reasonably secure. And it better do it in style and make me look like James Bond x Neo.
    
 down memory lane
 I&#x27;ve been playing with phones for some years now, I&#x27;ve been along for the ride when technology evolved from something the mainstream used at work to being part of everyone&#x27;s most intimate lives. To me, technology is there for both work and play, but when I buy a tool, I want it to work for me - not the other…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m pretty sure the answer to this will be no, but figured someone may have been in this spot before: so we use airwatch as an organisation and have recently given out new phones to remote users. The old ones have come back and the company wants to essentially wipe them and either give them to employees, or charity, as they are fully functional, just no longer fit for our site due to cyberessentials+
 Lucky me: the user&#x27;s don&#x27;t remember what pin numbers they had set on 3 of the phones and they had decided it was a good idea to make a random one (so IT can wipe the phone easier)... Then they forgot the code.. and the devices had already been deleted from airwatch....
 I&#x27;ve looked online and all I really see are jailbreakers and paid pin unlock suites, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of a free tool that can either remove the pin, or fully factory reset the devices (I&#x27;ve tried iTunes and the usual recovery with no joy), or if there is a way to re-enroll the devices back into airwatch temporarily to use the pin removal tool?

                              <span>So with the large amount of rants and upset people in jobs I thought I would take a moment to say that the job can be good too
 I honestly wake up every morning and enjoy the thought of going to work
 I work in health with a company that has about 40 sites and 1800 staff.
 I&#x27;ve got from servicedesk to business systems admin to Sys admin to Senior tech servicedesk L4
 I&#x27;ve had lots of opportunity to grow and move around teams to learn new things
 We have our share of issues, problem users and high pressure outages. But our manager has put together an awesome team, he allows us lots of freedom to work on whatever we feel like as long as the big jobs get done.
 There is hope out there, and there are really good jobs waiting. You just have to keep looking and checking out places

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m a sys admin in a team of three that own several applications as well as their hosting environments. I’m six months into this new job and have suddenly been thrown into a couple projects. 
 Unfortunately for me, my boss threw me into an ongoing project cycle due to one of our sys admins being out for several weeks, so I’m in the fire. I’ve been given a technical documentation by our vendor which I’m told is full of useless and confusing information and I need to basically decipher and translate it to work for the environment we have. I’m still new to our environment and applications so figuring out how to make this work within our infrastructure is extremely daunting. There are people I can ask for help but many of them are busy with their own tasks and projects and I don’t want to come off as helpless. 
 The company I work for is ridiculously understaffed and unorganized, so there is zero structure or timeline to these projects as well as very conflicting deadlines. I’ve literally been asked if it was possible to take this new project given to me and implement the entire thing in a non prod environment within 24 hours, no freaking way. All the while being asked by product managers and my boss for constant updates on other projects assigned to me. It’s extremely soul crushing. I’m so new to everything that it seems impossible to get anything done within the time frames they’re asking for and give updates. The micro managing is extremely severe to the point where I am asked for a project update every single hour, most of the time I’m still trying to figure out what to do and don’t have an answer. If I’m lucky one of the more senior guys will schedule a meeting with me later in the day to point me in the right direction. I’m starting to feel like I’m just not smart enough for this role and want out of IT completely because it seems like I run into this same issue with every job.

                              <span>I hate SCCM, never like it. It takes too much effort to maintain and it only works 50% of the time. 
 In saying that, Im trying to install Teams using Teams Wide Installer during a Task Sequence. It installs successfully and drops a Teams.exe in Program Files (x86) for a 64-bit installer and a registry key:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
 Name : Teams Wide Machine Installer
 Type: Reg_Expand_SZ
 Value: %ProgramFiles%\Teams Installer\Teams.exe --checkInstall --source&#x3D;default
 So according to Microsoft Documentation : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/msi-deployment
 Whenever a user signs into new Windows user profile, the installer is launched and will install teams in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Teams
 However, the user install does not happen. When the user logs in, they can find Teams anywhere. The only workaround to install teams is for them to to Program Files (x86)\Teams Installer and run Teams.exe. 
 This happens to all new builds and the user logs in for the first time. Anyone have similar experience or perhaps any SCCM guru that can shed some light on this? Any advice would be really appreciated

                              <span>We’re about to get a new server soon and I’m debating going to Hyper-v or not. We’re not a big shop, some on prem, some azure. Current server is esxi free and there is a dev server running the same. This server will replace both. 
 We have another set of servers that was deployed by our MSP as a hyper-v cluster before I joined and I’m not impressed. Things I can easily do in vSphere are either overly complicated or just don’t work as well. 
 The two things holding me back from going vSphere are keeping uniformity across systems and the uncertainty of the Broadcom deal. 
 I’ve got more experience with vSphere which is why I’m leaning that way and can easily justify the extra licensing on the cost our MSP would charge for all the migrations if we went hyper-v. 
 Any thoughts or advice?

 I&#x27;m trying to find documentation that recommends using sub domains but can&#x27;t seem to find any good posts/examples on how to accomplish this.
 It would be great is someone can share some documentation or experience on how they went about accomplishing this.

The default setup strips the domain and tries to use the login or username as the UID instead of the full email. VMware support has not been helpful thus far.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m transitioning into a networking role soon and will be dealing with a lot of phones and collaboration tools. This is all pretty new to me except I am familiar with basic networking. I&#x27;m looking for an all in one guide or video to learn the basics and get a good grasp before jumping off the deep end.
 I&#x27;ll be working with Teams (Direct Routing + Operator Connect), Zoom Phones, Cisco Call Manager, and some Vonage. I&#x27;ve already gone through some knowledge base articles with these vendors but I still don&#x27;t feel like I have a good baseline. I&#x27;m not looking for how to use these specifically more like what is a SBC, how do number translations work, what&#x27;s a SIP trunk, PTSN vs toll-free, etc. Anyone able to point me in the right direction for something like this?
 Thanks!!

                              <span>The old IT guy passed away. And VMWare doesn’t auto-start virtual machines on startup by default. One power outage, and now I’m stuck here until something gives.
 Can VMWare support help me? Can they brute force or somehow get past the root login if I pay the $300 PPI one time support cost?
 EDIT: The host machine is a Dell PowerEdge

 What certifications would you recommend for me? I still know how to manage networks and virtual machines. Did Azure REALLY take off? I just need some advice. Thank you.

                              <span>Definitely a rant, but I&#x27;ve noticed this most jobs other then those I&#x27;ve held in MSP or medical fields. As we speak, I am constantly being pinged by a new hire because no one is teaching him how do anything. I&#x27;m talking about functional things related to his job, like workflows, software tools beyond normal &quot;here is your computer, this is how you log on to the network and email&quot; type stuff. 
 Shouldn&#x27;t it logically be his team or supervisor teaching him? I only have a peripheral idea what/how they work, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not 100% telling him the &quot;right way&quot;. I keep stressing that he needs to ask other people, but no one else is answering him. 
 I&#x27;d say it was an org issue, but it was this way to an extent at previous employer as well. I trained people across the organization there as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen many businesses converting over to using MSP&#x27;s and cutting IT departments. Personally, I enjoy working for a small/medium business or non-profit organization and have seen them start to utilize MSP&#x27;s rather than full-time IT. I was just curious if my experience with MSP&#x27;s is a trend/norm in our field or unique to my geographical area/size of business.

 Just caused a flash fire and horrible smell in front of a classroom of 32 fifth graders. They enjoyed it, the teacher and I did not.
 That is all
 Edit: No, the projector doesn’t work anymore. We recently got Interactive Boards so luckily I had plenty of extra projectors to replace it with.

                              <span>Hello dear people working in IT.
 I&#x27;m trying not to rant or cry or moan about my job and what else, but I have a problem a lot of you can relate to.
 I&#x27;m 20 years old and just finished school. Very happy that I got to be a Sysadmin officially and love my job.
 Three months ago, I started working at a small company - we have around 30 people in our main building and another 15 in our logistics (majority is part-time &amp; don&#x27;t have access to computers or mail).
 At my first job interview with the company, I talked to H&amp;R and the external IT advisor. They told me that the old Sysadmin left the job months ago and have been without support for some time.
 They called him (let&#x27;s call him L) if there was no way they could&#x27;ve fixed the problems on their own (setting up new devices to the domain, add…</span>

 Server 1 - AD and fileserver - 400 users - only 240gb in files
 Server 2 - Proprietary financial system - SQL Server 2008
 New server: Intel® Xeon® E-2336 64GB RAM 2xSSD 960GB RAID1 Windows Server 2019 STD
 It&#x27;s my first time creating a VMs outside of my own computers, so so if you have any highlights so I don&#x27;t screw up will be appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Is it just me or do all newly promoted middle managers try to flex their new found authority over the IT department? Managers hired from the outside are usually fine, managers promoted from within feel like they need to prove something.
 - No, you cannot change corporate procedure. You and your new minions must still open a ticket or call the helpdesk. You cannot call me to speak “manager to manager” about Susie’s printer.
 - No, you cannot tell IT to buy your department all new laptops and pay for them out of IT’s budget. I don’t care what you promised your department.
 - No, you cannot buy unapproved hardware/software and demand IT install and support it. We will use our voodoo to block that crap and you cannot overrule us on this.
 - No, we will not make changes in our email filter so you can sell your MLM crap to your co-workers. Running a side business while using corporate assets is strictly forbidden in the employee handbook and managers don’t get exceptions.

So the RDG (Broker) is reachable and this part works fine. But the session, which i get from the broker, is an IP. From my understanding, this needs to be an FQDN/DNS, otherwise the certificate for the Session Server would be invalid. Anybody any insights, how i can force the Load balancer broker to offer me the hostname/FQDN/dns name of the session server? 
 Or should the Broker give me an hostname and i did something wrong?

 I am now IT support for a company of roughly 70 employees, with most of them being remote. We currently use google workspace as our domain.
 I’m looking for some tools that can scale as we grow so open to suggestions.
 Looking for software that can better manage devices in terms of updates, remote software to assist users, and internal ticketing.
 Thanks everyone!

 First off I hate Mac&#x27;s for enterprise use. They are such a pain in the ass to manage. Anyways, we use openvpn and for some reason only Mac computers refuse to use the internal DNS. I can hit resources by IP but not by name and if I get on a Windows PC using the same VPN settings it works fine. I tried adding our DNS server in system settings on the mac but it still wont resolve names. Anyone else have this happen? How do I fix this?

 Quick one, don&#x27;t know where to post this.
 If I were to create a webapp/database with old Windows (XP and under) licence keys to make them searchable, would Microsoft come after me with a legal team?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am a sysadmin in a company and I manage around ~170 Servers. Some of them are phyiscal, some virtual. Most of them run Windows Server 2012 / 2016 /2019 as their OS, but we also got some Linux Servers.
 So now our issue: We literally got almost no documention for our servers. We have list of our hostnames, but that is it.
 To better understand our current state: Recently our main FTP Server broke down because the Windows OS was broken. The server was not bootable anymore and therefore the config for the FTP server (IIS) was lost. Of course, no one knew how the FTP Service was configured in terms of directories, local users and other software. So we build up a new Server from scratch (which was the easy part) and talked to every service provider usising this FTP Server and telling them that the credentials and hostname / IP has changed (which was the not so nice part).
 We recently got the brilliant idea that it might be good to know what kind of Servers we have, which applications they are running and how they are configured.
 The first idea from one of my colleagues was to make a word document for every server, where we can wright the specs inside, which applications it runs and what steps were taken to configure the software (with screenshots). But yeah, let&#x27;s just not do that....
 And now my question: What is the best practice for Server documentation? I googled a bit of course and found some tools for documentation, but most of them are not free for testing or just don&#x27;t look that good to use.
 The way to document should have some kind automation to it and have a nice usability, so that my colleagues stay motivated to document.
 So should be just something dull like Word, Excel or Visio (which is easy but frustrating to use) or some kind of software, which scans our servers and document them? I think a hybrid of both things would be nice

                              <span>I have a question for publishing printers by site bsaed on the following design requirement:
 Implementing a print release system to use follow-me print across all sites.
 Management want just one print queue published
 We could publish one print queue from one server and allow the system to manage the follow-me function, but there&#x27;s also the requirement to ensure local print facilities are available in the case of a single site failure / link failure.
 It appears to be a limitation of the system we are using (or the design we&#x27;ve gone with) to have failover across sites - though I am also checking with our managed print provider, as I&#x27;m not the project manager just the technical lead.
 Currently using group policy, print perferences then item-level filtering to say if at X site then create printerX@serverX.com
 If at site Y create printerY@serverY.com etc.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is avoid a build up of printers in their list though, so if at site X I only want X printer deployed to that device. If they then take that laptop to site Y, deploy printer Y on login but remove printer X. The plan is the queue name would be the same on each server so to the end user it &quot;looks&quot; like one queue wherever they go
 Is that even possible? I worry it could increase logon times
 Any other suggestions?

 Back when I worked a call center tech job, I noticed my company laptop had some kinda &#x27;DNS stealth&#x27; software installed called sth like &#x27;Iris ... &#x27;.
 What are these and what are they for? I understand what DNS is or does. But I&#x27;ve never encountered such a solution before and was wondering if someone could explain to me, thanks

                              <span>We use shared local admin accounts with password auth on the infrastructure I inherited (~6 admins, many (hundreds) of machines). This worries me, any ex employee will still have access unless we go and change a lot of passwords. Automation is not really a thing here yet (I know, I know).
 Looking for a better solution I started to create an ansible playbook to roll out authentication via sssd/ldap. This basically works, everyone from the &quot;sysadmin&quot; group can now login via ssh and their individual passwords on my test machine. Accounts are automatically granted sudo rights based on group membership.
 Now, I have a couple of questions with respect to this approach:
  
Is there a way to preseed the sssd cache before first login? An admin might have to handle an emergency on a machine he’s never logged into and at that moment ldap might not be available. If not, any recommended alternative approaches?
 
I would prefer key auth over passwords but I don’t have much control over the AD/LDAP infrastructure so I don’t think I can store public keys there (and delegate ssh key lookup / caching to sssd). I could rollout and revoke keys via ansible but I’m unsure on how that would play with sssd/ldap. Like, when an account is locked in AD but still has an authorized key, can they still login?
 
Given all admins have sudo rights, what would be required steps to make sure they can&#x27;t access servers after they left? E.g. would we have to cleanout their authorized_keys in addition to disabling their users in AD/LDAP?
 
 Any inputs are appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve a frontend server with fpm 8.1 and nginx.
 2 cores and 4gb of RAM.
 A few days ago I upgraded from 18.04 to 22.04. I&#x27;ve kept the php fpm and cli version and did not change any fpm settings.
 Since the upgrade fpm consumes on average more cpu and I even run into issues that the fpm pools cant work the requests and I receive timeouts. 
 I can see that the load is close to 0 in the night when I dont have any traffic. And my traffic did not change in a way since the upgrade that might explain the higher need of cpu. 
 Is there any known issue regarding this? Any other package versions that come with 22.04 that might interfere with fpm?
 Thank you!

 So I&#x27;m not asking about how to migrate the emails, but steps needed to finalise user environments to &quot;ready to use&quot; state. If it&#x27;s still not clear, these are few things I have in mind:
  
windows updates
 
office365 update / installation of apps,most importantly outlook
 
do I need to remove and re-add outlook profile for each user? Or is this not an issue?
 
anything else?
 
 Any advice is appreciated. I will provide more info if needed

                              <span>I am in a growing startup, 30~ employees so far, using terraform as an AD with GSuite and manual account management to all the services that don&#x27;t support terraform for user management.
 I have no idea how to make sure that the services that we use are managed from somewhere central. I have seen some stuff can be done by playing around with SAML SSO and organisation setup in GSuite, but even like that, most of the services don&#x27;t use SAML SSO, and most of them don&#x27;t have API&#x27;s.
 So, how do you manage all the services your company uses and the permissions within them?

He is paralyzed of unknown outcomes of making autonomous decisions on devices or design..again never fully understanding on what he is doing in grand picture, or coming to that state of understanding slowly, often after consulting with others rather than exempting it from documentation, design maps, combined with general tech behavior available to be studied on internet.. not his first nature ..he is config implementer, now having offer for being design auditor..he has given my details to firm already..really having hard time what to write to not sabotage him, nor being dishonest.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I hope someone is able to help.
 I&#x27;m trying to setup Workspace in Outlook for our hybrid environment, but I can&#x27;t get it to work 100%.
 I&#x27;ve tried creating a distribution group, but the distribution group isn&#x27;t showing. These are on prem and not cloud, so what I&#x27;ve done is to create a new in the same OU and provide it same attributes as for one that&#x27;s working - but it&#x27;s not showing.
 Also, when googling around I see pictures showing &quot;Type: Workspaces&quot; which I can&#x27;t see in ours - we don&#x27;t have the Type button.
 I&#x27;m new in this position, so I haven&#x27;t setup this before.
 Thanks and wish you all a great day :-)

                              <span>I really hope this isn&#x27;t considered spam but if so, so be it.
 The goal:
 Preemptively install specific drivers (.inf files) and validate that they were installed by returning a specified exit code. 
 Install method:
 pnputil /add-driver $PSScriptRoot\*.inf /install
 Scratch method to discover:
 Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnpSignedDriver 
 What I&#x27;m finding is that pnputil is reporting that it successfully applied the .inf file yet when I look for the driver, it&#x27;s missing. If I can validate the install then I can generate the exit code. This has left me trying to better understand how drivers are handled by windows. Is &quot;applied&quot; installed, stored, or what?

                              <span>Few questions
 What are the other attributes in a live log? Is it radius request from the switch to ise or ISE to switch. I know the result is what ISE is pushing role/DACL? Need little understanding on ISE. 
 When I debug radius logs in switch? Does it show access request and access response logs in debugs. How do we differentiate from access request and access response. 
 Sorry if my questions doesnt make sense.

 Let&#x27;s say that the test coordinators insist you keep running it and switch ports, but you&#x27;ve already burnt through all 10 of them. Even worse, even after an hour it still says the ports are in use, and there is only a scheduled restart at midnight, and your shift is 9 AM.
 Is there a command or something I can run to free up a stuck port? The resources I&#x27;m reading online isn&#x27;t exactly helping, and this is holding me back from a MUCH better assignment. Thanks!

                              <span>I am curious to find out if anyone has any thoughts or experience in implementing micro segmentation for a campus wired network? What I mean is placing all users in a common L2 domain behind one L3 gateway and prevent lateral connections between them? Most controller-based wireless solution would have &#x27;LAN isolation&#x27; feature to enforce this but how would one do this with a bunch of stand-alone access switches? I had a look at private VLAN but that seems to require manual configuration on all switches.

 We currently use HPNA for various things such as config backup and diffs. I want to migrate to Ansible, but was curious if there’s a front-end application that will build playbooks for you based on what you’re trying to achieve. 
 Think drop-down of “run config backup every day at 3 am” or whatever. 
 Does anyone have any experience with something like this?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve recently been learning about networks and would love for someone to correct me and fill the gaps in my understanding of tier 2 ISPs. Here&#x27;s how I thing a tier 2 ISP connection to the internet looks like. What am I missing? 
 Client LAN -----&gt; Client Router -----&gt; Local Loop Telephone Exchange -----&gt; Router @ Carrier Hotel -----&gt; Tier 1 ISP
 Am I missing anything from this high level topology? Where can I learn more about this? Thanks!

                              <span>We are migrating away from ASA to Palo and also disabling our Zscaler proxy service and using Palo as well. Looking to peel off 80/443 from AnyConnect clients and send to Palo so we can disable Zscaler PAC file. Currently have set up ACL for test client, tied to route-map (that points to Palo) and assigned to WAN interface. Testing shows that ACL/route-map is hit and should send to Palo but unable to see anything in pcaps on the ASA or Palo indicating outbound web based traffic is leaving the ASA. Debug shows hits:
 br: policy based route lookup called for 10.5.33.10/63738 to 172.217.168.227/443 proto 6 sub_proto 0 received on interface WAN
 pbr: First matching rule from ACL(21)
 pbr: route map AnyConnect_to_Palo, sequence 10, permit; proceed with policy routing
 pbr: evaluating next-hop 10.5.7.23
 Packet tracer shows its getting dropped on NAT, phase 14, rpf-check, as its not expecting traffic from that subnet on that interface. In theory, it sounds like it should work but Im not seeing where its getting dropped to the Palo. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Ill attach a basic topology too. Thanks.
 Edit: Reason behind design is that the Zscaler service contract is up on 12/31 and looking to not renew for an entire year when we need maybe an extra few weeks in to 2023 to move all end users to GlobalProtect.

                              <span>Hello. My boss wants to use Airplay on the tv. I am going through the logs and I am not sure what is blocking it. I am using avahi to allow mdns for the network. The TV supports Airplay. 
 Android device on network 1 is able to screen share to network 2.
 Apple Device on network 1 is not able to screen share to network 2.
 network 2 is more secured and is not allowed to talk to any of our other networks. I am not sure if it would be using a different port. I am not seeing anything. Going off of Apple&#x27;s site, Airplay uses 80, 443, 554, 3689, and 5353 which I have made a rule for that to be allowed.
 Any direction would be helpful.

                              <span>Hey everyone
 I&#x27;m a fairly new network associate at a huge workplace (~40K employees), and it bugs me beyond belief that not a single decent topology drawing of the company&#x27;s bigass network exists.
 I&#x27;m mingling with the thought of starting the project of mapping the entire infrastructure of the company (it&#x27;s a huge project which will never be complete, I know), but I don&#x27;t think a tool like Visio or Drawio would cut it, since it would become too huge too fast (unless these programs have functionalities that I don&#x27;t know about).
 Is there any tool out there for drawing up massive topologies? I&#x27;m thinking about &#x27;layering&#x27; functions like e.g. a geographical topology where I might open up a location, where I might choose between e.g. physical, L2 or L3 topologies pr. location, etc. A cascading system, if you will, where only the wished for information is displayed at a time.
 Hope the question makes sense!

                              <span>so im a sys admin at a startup and currently ive been requested to setup a small network for the office
 the network would basically be :
 the modem (supplied by our ISP so its a shitty basic modem) &gt; a firewall (ive never setup one of these ) &gt; a big switch (that we have on a small rack at the office) &gt; 10 tables with 6 user per table (there is a cisco sg300-10 switch on each table) and 4 access points 
 everything besides the modem is Cisco so im guessing there wont be any compatibility issues but ive never setup a network so im unsure of the things ill need (data/info about my network, certificates, etc), best practices, things to look for, tools, test that should be done, general rules, monitoring, security, etc
 so if somebody could help me out and tell me the &quot;procedure/process&quot; you guys personally go trough when setting up an enterprise network or point me in the direction i need to go it would be very appreciated
 my networking experience is limited as before ive only worked in &quot;big&quot; companies and on those ive always had a network engineer or similar taking care of this

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 I have a small office and would like to separate my internet into 3 segregated wifi signals for &quot;security&quot; purpose.
 -1 Wifi for Clients
 -1 Wifi for the public
 -1 Wifi for the staff and myself.
 ​
 As it is not possible for me to have cables pulled in the building(cost reason), will 3 wifi help with the security of the internet?
 All my staff PCs have kasperky cloud
 But for the public and client wifi, as I cannot control their devices, I am worried that viruses/trojans infect the Pcs of my staff. Would 3 wifis, help with this issue?
 ​
 Would you know any piece of hardware that could allow me this please?
 The covering radius is about 25 meters.
 ​
 Thanks all!

 Just looking out there what is available as Web Filters for Internet Traffic on Azure Virtual Desktops for a business. At the moment we are using Trend Micro Web Security which works on a Proxy method which seems to work well for us just can be a pain to manage and troubleshoot sometimes. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions on other web filters that we could look into
 Thanks

                              <span>Title says it all. I have a bunch of old ASAs and old ISR G2&#x27;s that are giving me problems with Anyconnect SSLVPN, so I need to buy some new boxes.
 What is the preferred physical box currently for Anyconnect SSLVPN termination, and what is the preferred virtual machine? vASA or CSR1000v?
 TIA!

                              <span>I’ve started my ‘dream job’ and am completely overwhelmed. I have a heavy workload, learning new systems, addressing incident and request tickets, and creating and executing projects with a lot of moving targets and deadlines. 
 I’m still green so this also plays into a frustration with handling items a bit slower than I’d like. I also know that I tend to ‘take on the world’ and feel reluctant to ask for help too soon. It is important that I do my due diligence before leaning into my team as I want to ensure I am carrying my weight. Getting my hands on things is also the best way for me to learn.
 As I’m writing this post I believe I may just need to vent but also ask as to whether this is the norm as a sys eng? Because if so, I truly need to adjust in the way that I handle my work and the way it ties into my mood and stress level.
 What’s y’all experience, strategies, and coping mechanisms?

 From what I remember it was fairly consistent. Is it still a good experience building packages and deploying them?

I&#x27;m looking to move up in my department and I am driven to push our department forward but I have coworkers who now routinely expect me to do the vast majority of the work or simply give me the busy work they don&#x27;t want to do. I literally do more tickets than our entire IT department combined... By a longshot. Everyone around me has time to spare to play on their phones and simply refuse to do tickets. If I get training they all get jealous and complain. My coworkers who are the same level as me do almost nothing. It&#x27;s not a lack of experience or knowledge but I see them slacking off all day while I&#x27;m working on overhaul. When they are motivated by the bosses it&#x27;s only fleeting and they quickly go back t…</span>

                              <span>We all used to have password reset requests for users as a farily common occurence, and there is considerable tooling now to automate that/deal with that issue. AADSSPR has been great for us. 
 But now... occupying that same ticket &#x27;slot&#x27; is the MFA reset requests &quot; I broke my phone&quot; &quot;I changed phones&quot; &quot;I uninstalled the app&quot;... is anyone else getting inundated with these now and what tooling or processes do you have in place for them? We have been using app absed number mathcing (had it enabled while in preview) as the &#x27;main&#x27; MFA method. 
 These days with WHfB users aren&#x27;t prompted for notification based MFA often - which I think is making it easier for the app based method to lapse/be forgotten about.

                              <span>Figured I should post this to sort of vent, but also receive advice as I’m currently in charged of a whole IT department for 2 separate locations with about 40 internal/ 100+ clients. I jumped from a systems admin role to IT Manager with only 2.5 years of experience. Even then, I was only handling lower level tickets and worked for an MSP for a year where they literally only had be call Comcast whenever a site went down.. Anyways I feel extremely incompetent as now I’ve been pushed to a director role just 6 months of being here. I just got an intern that I am now training to help me with tasks, but even that requires so much of my time to train on top of dealing with executive meetings and last minute requests from management. 
 Anything related with equipment is basically my responsibility even if I have no idea where it came from or how it got purchased. We have a programs team that is the biggest department in our organization and yet they’re the ones that fail to manage their things and I’m now having to take ownership of their mistakes. I wonder how common this is, and what was your experience as a one man/woman IT. 
 What has helped you with stepping into a leadership role? I’m currently reading the IT Manager Guidebook since that was the only book I’ve found so far, but even so I’m so freaked out at the fact that I don’t know anything and I have so much yet to learn that it’s so overwhelming. Appreciate any advice/resources that has helped you manage a similar situation.
 (btw no disrespect to my intern when I say “1.5” they are just not fully available to assist me. So still it would be a 2 man IT department, don’t want to diminish their contribution )

                              <span>I’m sure I’ll get a bunch of boo hoo’s for this but I’ve been mostly WFH for the past couple years.. typically I’ll go onsite once every other week to rack a server, swap out a failed drive or eject a tape. Typically while onsite I’m the only one in the department apart from a desktop technician.. this week we have someone in from another site so we’re all in the office. It’s only day two and it’s been so exhausting interacting with people all day. I didn’t think it was going to be a big deal but after commuting back and forth from the office and working face to face with people all day, I just want to go hide.

                              <span>Just today we had an issue where one of the terminal servers went offline and we had to reboot it, causing multiple staff to lose their work. Upon rebooting the server everything looked fine, but we were recieving multiple calls asking if something was down, or if it was safe to log in again.
 I was thinking, it would be great if the IT department had a website we could share with users to just have us post a quick &quot;this server went down, but services will be restored soon.&quot; or &quot;Reminder, we are doing maintenance tonight at 10PM&quot; messages that staff could view throughout the day. Mostly just a status and maintenance update kind of site that we can send out when there&#x27;s a known issue and an all clear.
 The purpose would be, of course, if there is something acting up, staff can bring up the page quick and see that there is a problem and what we&#x27;re doing to resolve, so they do not have to call in or wonder and call us to ask.
 I&#x27;m imaging like a live webpage that we can post messages, but have them read only and not allow for replies, new items go to the top and old messages are pushed down over time. Maybe we can mark older issues a resolved and important information like &quot;If you continue to have issues, please try logging off and back in for better performance.&quot;
 Anyway, does that make sense? Is there anything like that we can utilize? I know we can send out emails to staff/groups for updates, but many things do not need to go to all staff, and not all staff need to be aware of issues impacting just certain groups or applications. We were thinking maybe Teams would have something like that, but even so Teams seems a bit underwhelming for that. I&#x27;m thinking just a landing page where we can push out quick updates.

                              <span>Hey! Quick context. The company I work at NEVER deletes anything from AD. From disabled accounts to old computers/servers, they just disable them and let them be (they been doing this for like 10+ years).
 A couple months ago we started a project to clean everything and we still havent found a way to safely delete every disabled user/system (they never do it especially cause they hire a lot of consultants and a lot of them come and go and they just enable/disable their users).
 Pretty cool thing I just discovered (mind I have 0 exp on the area Im literally new on the job) is that you can export/import users. So I thought about exporting them, storage them in any fileserver and delete them from AD. If we ever decide to use them again we just import them with their groups and stuff like they where when we disabled it. Would this work?. 
 Another suggestion we had was to make &quot;parallel OUs&quot; and storage every disabled/thing in the same OU with some kind of designated name like &quot;Logistic Users - Disabled&quot; or something like that. But this would still invovle having EVERY disabled thing still there.
 ​
 What do you guys do to keep AD clean?.
 Is there any tool to keep track of disabled/enabled users? I just use powershell for everything but Im sure theres a more efficient way.

 Received a ticket today from one of our Support team that their account keeps getting locked out. OK, No biggie.
 Check the lockouts and I see that its happening all over the company???
 Major security issue?
 Long Story short: Support Engineer has been mapping drives for users using HIS account. Changed his password last night and has been locking out.
 I was able to get a list of most of the machines that are locking out. I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it to gather more. I spoke with his manager about it and we are going to treat this one as a learning experience.

 Cleaning out a 2 decade old storage closet? Oh there are a few monitors and towers in here, IT guys will get the whole thing cleaned out. 
 Cardboard recycling is right next to the IT Office? The IT guys will take the entire buildings cardboard out to the dumpster daily.
 ​
 Is this normal or does my employer just need have a person to handle this stuff haha.

All valid, we feel your pain, we even did a webcast on how to deal with general sysadmin burnout.
 But with the Holidays coming, I&#x27;m hoping you might be willing to share some of your more heartwarming stories from your career. Competent user who made your day? Manager gave you praise that you didn&#x27;t expect? It wasn&#x27;t DNS?
 I think we could all use a good pick-me-up.

                              <span>I have a full size legacy PCI card that needs to be supported in a new workstation. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to purchase a warrantied system with a dedicated PCI port on the mobo, but this is proving to be quite challenging. Is there any solution out there currently? 
 I&#x27;ve priced out a custom build (some business mobos do have legacy PCI still), but I&#x27;d rather have a service contract for the thing and it not be me on the hook. 
 I&#x27;ve thought about a riser/adapter, but I&#x27;d rather go with a dedicated PCI port if I can.

                              <span>Today I had to tell a member of our helpdesk team, who has admin level access to all workstations (MFA protected Windows logins as well) NOT to login, hand a laptop over to another user, and walk away. Apparently he&#x27;s been doing it for weeks because the guy who was doing it before him (at least that guy wasn&#x27;t an admin) hasn&#x27;t been there.So instead of asking us how to get these users logged into a laptop with access to what they needed, he figured why bother? Just log them in as himself and they can access whatever they need.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t even know if this is a rant, question, quiet quitting, or maybe frustration or all of the above.
 ​
 I have been in IT for 20+ years and this is not my first merger and acquisition, so I know it can be done the correct way. The owners of the 3000+ people company I work for bought three small companies (around 60 people total) about a month ago and want to merge those companies into one new company (our company will operate independently) with a new domain, Azure tenant, email, etc. IT was not involved in any of the initial discussions until the deal closed. We were told to drop everything and focus on this project but as other teams complain up the chain, the drop everything and focus on the merger goes out the window.
 ​
 This project needs to get done by December 31st and there&#x27;s no leeway on that time. We talked to some consulting companies and even they say getting it done by end of the year, especially with the US holidays is not possible. We have also been told that if this doesn&#x27;t get done by end of the year, we may all be looking for new jobs. Oh, did I mention that we still do not have any access to the other companies yet to even start any migration, IT from the other companies are dragging their feet with this information.
 ​
 I guess this is where the rant/frustration comes in, but with a message like that from our management and a timeline that does not seem achievable by companies that dedicate their business to mergers (consultants), I don&#x27;t get what chance our small and understaffed team of IT people have at getting this done by end of the year. What&#x27;s the point of doing any work for the remainder of the year... I don&#x27;t know, just frustrated I guess....Open to hearing other people&#x27;s thoughts and opinions.

                              <span>I just discovered Microsoft Powertoys because I got a new monitor (43&quot;) and wanted to set up virtual zones for my applications to really utilize the space how I envisioned it... I am so sad that I never came across this until now! It does a lot of stuff that I have separate apps for like always on top, Awake, color picker, etc... From what I have seen, these are features that sometimes get baked into Windows, as defaults... And it&#x27;s amazing! The PowerToys Run tool is a game changer for me on Windows.... So I hope that I was able to help at least a few people discover this awesome tool to add to their Arsenal! 
 EDIT:
 This has been around for a while and it is &quot;new&quot; to me!

 My users have to initiate a VPN manually. Then they have to do a Quick Assist or LogMeIn session with the helpdesk but when they can&#x27;t get into their laptop they&#x27;re totally stuck. I usually give them the local admin password but even that takes a long time because they type it wrong 20 times. 
 There must be a better way? What do you do?

I am configuring port mirroring on our VMware environment using VCenter - we use distributed switches and the issue I am running into is when a new VM is built it has to manually be added to the port mirror config. Is there a way to automate this in VMWare? Current process - Login to VCenter - Networking - Configure - Port Mirror - edit mirror session - Select Sources - find VM - select VM - Hit OK. - Not sure this is possible within VMWare it self by using templates. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am looking for a solution to locate AP in the ceiling panel without touching every AP. I thought it may be an android or ios app that I could use to help me find some Meraki AP&#x27;s that are very high in the ceiling, any suggestions or recommendations on an easy way to locate and map these AP&#x27;s out?

                              <span>We host an Avigilon server and periodically, it needs to be restarted due to some AD-related issues. However, whenever it is restarted the internet and all VOIP phones go down for about 3-4 minutes across the entire organization. I have a hunch it may be DNS related, but if the server is left powered off, internet and phones will still restore their connections after a few minutes. This server does not host any DNS/DHCP services and is only running Avigilon server. Any ideas what may be causing this behavior?

 Anyone an idea? Can we get in touch with them somehow?

                              <span>I think I did a huge mistake..
 I was enrolling computers in Azure AD, and I forgot to copy over the desktop from the local account.
 Now when I choose &quot;Different Account&quot; at the lockscreen it wont allow me to write in the local account. Even tried with &quot;.\localusername&quot;.. So now I just tried to edit on premissions on the local users folder, and toggled on &quot;hidden files&quot;, but I cant find the desktop there..
 Anyone who can help me with this?
 :EDIT:
 It was all just a moment of panic. The user had OneDrive sync, but didnt check off desktop, so when I log on the OneDrive the desktop didnt sync. So that&#x27;s why I kinda paniced. But for some reason there was a file inside the mess in OneDrive that was called desktop. So I managed to recover it from there.

Enabled internet explorer integration policy to IE mode
  
2)Configured sites on the Enterprise list using manager to an xml
 3)Configured using the enterprise mode IE website list policy
 4)Configured also using the configure the enterprise mode site list policy
 ​
 My issue is that IE mode is working fine for administrator users but on normal users if the initial website that i have putted on the xml is changed a bit IE mode goes back to Edge . This is very weird , it works correcly for admins and on non-admin users the initial website is working , but if it changes it does not work , as it goes back to edge

                              <span>I am tasked with verifying on a bunch of unmanaged Win10 computers weather or not certain things are true, for security purposes.
 - Antivirus software Installed / enabled
 - Bitlocker enabled
 - Screensaver set to 15 minutes + Lock workstation
 - Automatic updates enabled
 Is there a script or app that could easily verify all this in 1 go? Powershell? Fairly ignorant about scripting in general. If I had to do more than 50 computers, my first thought would be to hire someone to write a small app that reads the relevant registry settings to then report true or false on each setting.
 Again, these are not company owned machines and have no Active Directory or anything of the sort. Continual monitoring of weather these settings stay as they are in the future is not currently required.
 There may be appetite for a similar script for Mac users, but ... 1 thing at at time.
 I suppose I could aim for a slightly higher level of sophistication, where the app would capture some fingerprints like the date, computer name, and Mac address etc to keep as evidence of compliance.

                              <span>Hi there, 
 We have a web proxy running for web filtering and it uses the user&#x27;s credentials to authenticate via the Web Filter. But for this to happen the session has to do a HTTP request on a web browser that is using the proxy.
 We use MS Edge as the default browser. 
 Does anyone know of a way that I can automatically do a HTTP request when the user logs in via MS Edge so when they open the browser the session will already be authenticated?
 Problem we have is most sites these days are HTTPS, and for the web filter to authenticate it must be a http site. 
 Any workaround anyone has would be great to hear of.
 Thanks

 Has someone encountered similar issues or does this indicate a misconfiguration?

                              <span>Hi All
 I have been asked to look again into delaying all emails by 2 mins, so that any errors can be rectified by dragging the item back out of the outbox. 
 I see that this can be easily done per user via a simple Outlook rule in the rules wizard. But can this be acheived across the firm somehow? Maybe something implemented in a transport policy in Exchange Online?
 I am hoping someone has implemented this before and has it working , so they can tell me what they are using and how it was implemented. 
 Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>New sysadmin here,
 My current job is making a redundant NPS server to login to the WIFI.
 The current NPS server also functions as the root CA that enables trust for the clients. Because of a problem with our network, we are unable to chain this CA to a publicly trusted CA. Meaning users need to accept our CA as trusted when first logging into our network.
 My boss said that I should make the new server a root CA as well. However, this would mean devices would also need to accept this new CA as trusted. This could cause confusion amongst users, why I am not keen on the solution.
 My idea is as follows:
  
Copy all NPS settings to the new server.
 Make this new server a subordinate CA, chaining it to the already existing root CA.
  
I have two questions regarding this setup:
  
Will this make it so devices only need to accept a certificate once?
 What happens when the existing (root CA) is down, will the trust in the subordinate CA keep persisting?
  
I am still a bit of a noob when it comes to NPS and certificates, so any help would be appreciated!

 Do you have any experience integrating Splunk with Shuffle and Thehive? I got no idea where to start and don&#x27;t have the picture painted in my mind so any architectural/networking information would be highly appreciated!
 Do you think it&#x27;s a good combination? Any tips or recommendations are welcome.

                              <span>Starting from an LVM VG made by 1 PV that is a MDADM RAID5 array of 4 drives, which is the best way to extend the VG?
 We are replacing the 4 drives with bigger ones and we are wondering which is better to do:
  
Extend the mdadm raid5 partitions on the disk (in order to occupy the free space of each new disk) and then grow, in order: mdadm RAID5 -&gt; PV -&gt; VG.
 Create 4 new partitions on the unused space of the new disks, create a new raid5 array from them, add the new mdamd array as PV and extend the VG.
  
Thanks in advance

I look after a small office with 8x Dell Optiplex 3070&#x27;s in micro form factor and they intermittently and randomly will not post when the staff arrive in the morning to turn them on. There is a post error code on the power button that is amber 2 blinks on, 1 off, 1 on (video below). 
 In talking to Dell and scouring reddit/the internet internet indicates motherboard or system failure. They are on warranty for another month from Dell, and we&#x27;ve replaced the motherboards in a couple systems and the problem persists so I think it is something else. They are all stock with the exception of replacing the spinning drives they shipped with with Samsung 860 EVO&#x27;s.

                              <span>I&#x27;m transitioning into IT at 35 after working in education the last 10 years. I consider myself reasonably intelligent and have been working rather successfully towards industry certifications. Now, as many of you rightly point out, certifications don&#x27;t equal experience. All they serve to do is fill gaps in my theory, such as being unaware of how networking works until studying OSI model, TCP, etc.
 So the question then becomes, how do I learn how to do things right? Many folks on here talk about homelabbing, and I&#x27;m slowly but surely spinning up things with Azure credits and Raspberri Pis, but at the end of the day, all of my work relies on internet research. If some yahoo on StackOverflow says to set it up one way or another, there&#x27;s little I can do to verify that this is a conceptually sound process, because I lack the experience - I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know.
 Of course, many people would next say &#x27;get the experience.&#x27; But how can one do that if one does not have the experience to get the job in the first place? That is to say, my goal is working my way into systems administration. In such a job they might want me to produce an effective backup storage solution, but if my knowledge comes from tainted sources, how can I do this? It seems like so, so many organizations are running with these barebones IT teams where there&#x27;s really limited opportunity to start as a junior admin and learn under them over time.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have a client who has 2 machines with an underlying Windows XP OS. Users in the Office put files in the machines through network share. 
 Found out the connection they use is SMBv1, which is a security risk.
 I have been tasked to find a solution for it.
 First of all they can upgrade their system to the latest OS but its going to cost them a lot, which they&#x27;d like to avoid. They also like to avoid using USB Sticks and keep walking from the Office to the machines.
 I thought of using a NAS(Network Attached Storage) but I don&#x27;t think this is going to work because the NAS needs to place files in the machine, which I have no clue how to do that, or is this even possible.
 Second, the machines don&#x27;t need access to the internet at all. I preferably like to isolate the machines from the internal network, which can be done with a NAS.
 Finally, disable access to the internet on the machines and leave it as it is, which is not secure.
 Any idea&#x27;s how to solve this?

 But I know for a fact that the User is created because it has a profile on a laptop connected to the domain.
 Thank you in advance.

 For a certain software we use, a specific Windows user must be created first. Right now we create the uset using PowerShell. But to ensure the installation works, we have to signout and signin to the newly created user at least one to run the OOBE?.
 Is there a way to run this stuff which is shown at first login from the command line?

I want to ensure that my thoughts on this are correct prior to moving forward as we dont have a test environment, but have many many switches/routers in environment.
 Is it as easy and creating a new vlan 199 naming it native on each router/swtich/nexus and then inputting the command:
 switchport trunk native vlan 199. Or is there something else that needs to be done that I am missing?

                              <span>Hi, currently we have 2 ASA&#x27;s in a HA pair for our Web hosting firewalls, these firewalls directly portchannel into our border leaf ACI environment where the servers live.
 The issue is that for our outgoing Internet traffic on our other pair of ASA&#x27;s, I&#x27;m going to use PBR to divert traffic to our new outgoing Palos to avoid a big bang, but for our new web hosting Palos, I can&#x27;t use PBR because the border leafs go directly into the current web hosting ASA firewalls. So there is no way for me to re-route traffic to reach the new solution.
 All of the clients/servers on the webhosting side have their gateways pointed to the current interfaces on our web hosting ASA&#x27;s (not on a BD in ACI). So these gateways would need to point to the new solution to. The new solution will have the same interfaces, ip&#x27;s in the same networks etc... but will be different ip&#x27;s. 
 I need to find a way to avoid a big bang approach of just flicking over the all the servers gateways to the new firewalls with the migrated rule sets on and hoping for the best. I&#x27;d much rather try and find a way to control traffic, like I am doing with PBR on our outgoing solution.
 Hopefully I&#x27;ve explained it clearly enough.
 Thanks everyone

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m in the middle of a firewall migration from ASA to Palos and have run into a couple of issues (I&#x27;ll make another post if people want to check that out to as its a seperate issue). 
 For this one, we have 2 firewalls in a HA pair for our outgoing Internet traffic, we have public addresses free so I can use them on our new solution instead of being limited to the one on the current solution.
 Essentially I&#x27;m going to put a new public ipv4 address on our new solution as the physical IP, all is good expect for the issue that some of our servers use services on the Internet and these services expect the NAT&#x27;d traffic to come from our current public IP, we can&#x27;t afford next to any downtime because of the business we are and we want to avoid a &quot;big bang&quot; approach to this to. Does anyone have any ideas how I can get around this?
 At the moment my only one is to get the services on the Internet to whitelist our entire range instead of just the physical public interface ip at the moment?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, our current Guest WiFi system is basically an open SSID that leads to a Meraki splash page where you enter your mobile number as a form of ID and gain access to the network.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at different ways to improve on this. My first thought was to use the same ID method but with a WPA3 PSK so the average Joe on the street couldn&#x27;t just connect to. But this wouldn&#x27;t stop someone from leaking the key I suppose in the end.
 So after that I&#x27;ve now thought about an approval process where possibly our 1st line helpdesk could approve access after a user enters their details in with a reason for being onsite etc...
 Has anyone implemented a process like this before. We have a Meraki AP architecture and ISE as our radius server. I was thinking/hoping that there could be a guest splash page that could link into ISE and for ISE to do some cool stuff behind the scenes with approvals.
 Thanks

                              <span>We are currently set up as a &quot;flat&quot; network... Layer 2 is everywhere segmented by VLANs but unfortunately, we use VLAN1 for a lot of things. We are setting up a separate location using Comcast P2P. All the things at this location would need to talk to servers on a mix of VLANS. Eventually, we want to route everything but one of my questions is does it have to be done all at once? Our initial thought is to start with this location and then move on to everything else. 
 Doing some research, I believe the most future-proof routing protocol would be OSPFv2 (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). Is it going to be a huge headache to connect a 10.0.0.0 to a 192.168.0.0 network? Currently, everything is on 192.168. The biggest reason we want to move to layer 3 is that we have a data center connected to the main location via 2 dark fibers and 1 P2P fiber. Currently, they are separated from each other and the P2P is on a disabled port only to be enabled when the other 2 are down. The 2 dark fibers are redundant but we want to connect that 3rd one to the other 2 dark fibers. We either can&#x27;t do that or can&#x27;t figure out how to do that because the 2 dark fibers are 10g and the P2P is 1g.
 Is it feasible to move to layer 3? We have roughly 350 PCs, 100 printers, ~400 phones, 35 switches, and ~100 servers and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing more. We are a small team of 4 that does it all, Only 2 of us do the networking I would not call us experts by any means but we make it work. Any problems I didn&#x27;t think of please let me know.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a hotel, between 100- 150 rooms. Each room might have 2-3 devices going at the same time, so I&#x27;m looking at potentially as many as 400 devices that need wifi, maybe even more at peak.
  
 Almost every hotel has absolutely crummy internet, and I&#x27;m trying to avoid that.
 What are your recommendations for routers and router setups to accommodate this many devices?
 This is pretty key. Is there a way to set it up where the available bandwidth is divided up by password? For example I give someone a code they can use to sign into with as many devices as they like, but the total bandwidth allotted to that password would be something like 1MBps?
 Unfortunately the internet service is Frontier, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s optional.
  
Thank you in advance for any advice, I&#x27;m fairly tech savvy but networking is out of my wheelhouse.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to configure route-tag on our Nexus 7K&#x27;s to nip some routing loops in the bud where we do mutual re-distribution between OSPF and BGP. I have the following configured.
 route-map multipod-bgp&gt;ospf deny 10 match tag 100 route-map multipod-bgp&gt;ospf permit 20 set tag 200 ! route-map multipod-ospf&gt;bgp deny 10 match tag 200 route-map multipod-ospf&gt;bgp permit 20 set tag 100 ! router ospf 1 vrf overlay-1 router-id 10.30.19.12 redistribute bgp 65500 route-map multipod-bgp&gt;ospf log-adjacency-changes ! router bgp 65500 vrf overlay-1 address-family ipv4 unicast redistribute direct route-map multipod-route-map redistribute ospf 1 route-map multipod-ospf&gt;bgp 
 Now I do this for EIGRP/BGP as well, and on EIGRP L3 interfaces I also apply tags using an inbound distribute-list with the same route-map with the following syntax:
  ip distribute-list eigrp vrf-A route-map eigrp&gt;bgp in 
 Now the question is how do I configure this same thing for an OSPF L3 interface? The commands are not the same as eigrp and don&#x27;t really seem to have an analog and I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to apply a distribute-list to an OSPF L3 interface.

                              <span>Right now I have (2) SG300-28P and (1) SG-300-52. Total 108 ports, not all in use. These are close to 10 years old and rock solid, never failed but it&#x27;s time.
 Don&#x27;t need POE, we have some POE switches as we had some Cisco Phones. Did away with those.
 Don&#x27;t need managed or stackable. We are not managing these switches at all. It&#x27;s a small shop BUT I will probably get managed anyway if they offer better performance?
 So I am looking at getting two 48 port Non-POE GE Cisco switches.
 So I am comparing the CBS220 vs CBS250 vs CBS350 series. What is the main difference between these, anybody? TIA.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 since starting networking, I was looking for a tool to create a interactive network diagram.
 Basically the &quot;main goal&quot; is, to have a interactive world map with all network locations and datacenter (including the connections to each other). What I mean by interactive is, that you can hover over a country or location and see the most important information as well as being able to &quot;drill down&quot; by double clicking it.
 I know it is a lot, but and I tried several solutions over the years and found not a single one to create such a &quot;diagram&quot;
 - Visio - Great for detailed Branch Network documentations, but not intereactive
 - Miro - Interactive and easy to use for &quot;quick and dirty&quot; schematics
 - draw.io - same as Miro
 - powerpoint - Interactive but not really meant for network diagrams
 - lucidcharts - same as visio
 - NetBrain - expensive, kinda hard to master and not &quot;easy to use&quot;
 - Any other SDN tool (solarwinds, n-map, ...) same as netbrain
 - even tried some tools for scientific network maps - They basically do what I need but just to a certain degree
 - .....
 As you might notice I&#x27;ve tried a lot and might even have missed some things i tested in the past.
 Maybe one of you big brains out there has something in mind or created something similar in the past.
 I am looking forward for any tips, hints and suggestions :)

                              <span>What are the reasons to replace/upgrade an ONT? Is it just to deliver faster speeds? Can an ISP install a 10G ONT and limit the port speed to whatever the subscriber is paying for 1G, 2.5G etc. That way the subscriber would have an ONT that’s future proof should the subscriber choose to upgrade to faster speeds?
 Is there any other reason to replace/upgrade an ONT other than a failure or physical speed limit of the ethernet port?
 How long does an ONT typical last?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I hope this is the right place to post this,
 I&#x27;m looking for a 1U switch for a datacenter rack with the following requirements.
  
2 x SFP+ or faster fibre for link to meet-me-room
 24 x 1G RJ45
 Managed L2 switch
 Redundant power supply
 Doesn&#x27;t block with various frame sizes at 60%+ saturation
 Budget max ~2k Euro
 Max 200W power usage (No PoE needed)
  
I have looked into Mikrotik CRS354-48G-4S+2Q+RM, but from the Servethehome performance review mentioned one should buy a different switch if used at higher saturation. Also some comments about Ubiquiti USW-EnterpriseXG-24 and FS S5850-24XMG, though these are 10G L3 switches, so much more than required for my use case. So should be OK?
 Any model or brand you would recommend instead? I saw HP Aruba instant on, but they don&#x27;t have a redundant PSU except for the CX line. Arista or Brocade?
 Thanks,Matt

                              <span>Hello! 
 All my life i tried to mantain my network, cables and devices all working under the same pattern (usually 568A) and only when needed to,use a crossover cable. In my current adventure, i have little resources and a doubt.
 I have in my hands:
 A rack filled with T568B &quot;Male&quot; Rj-45 cat5e cables.
 A nice furukawa patch-panel.
 Tons of T568A cat5e patch cords of the size i need.
 My doubt: If i crimp the male cables INTO the (female) patch panel at the same pattern as the other end, that is, T568B, then connect the patch cable to my switch through the T568A patch cord... Would i be limiting the internet to 100mb or would it still distribute GBe? Would it even work properly?
 If that wouldn&#x27;t work... Any suggestions on working it around? would crimping the cables into the patch panel as T568A - same as patch cord - even though the other end is 568B, be better?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a network that is getting bogged down and I believe it is due to 1 device sending lots of ARP requests. It sends them every other packet for the IP of the device it is currently in session with. It is some type of industrial switch/control. I am new to modbus/TCP and is this normal? It is doing it nonstop all day. I do not have access to the network, only the pcap files from a few hosts on the network.

 Smaller the better. Needs to have one physical port at least. Even better I&#x27;d it had an on board serial too.

 The Juniper documentation says that it will be configured using a instance-type virtual-switch, but then I can&#x27;t find any configuration examples of this. I just want traffic coming over the PW to be sent out a single AC which will be performing a swap on the outer VLAN tag.

I mainly do sys admin and tech support and do not get to dabble in networking as much as I&#x27;d like, but the current configuration we have is so confusing to me since I am not familiar with CISCO ASA&#x27;s.
 Just a quick summary of our environment: We have 2 buildings that need to be connected together. The main building and the remote location which is a few miles away. These 2 locations are currently connected via CISCO ASA&#x27;s.
 Here is a network diagram of how things are connected: https://freeimage.host/i/capture.HfdMblR
 We have IP Phones which are configured to be on VLAN 2, and they also get their own separate DHCP Addresses from the CISCO ASA&#x27;s. These IP phones also act as a passthrough to provi…</span>

 could you help me?
 What ISP is or was owner of IP address 86.49.187.186.
 One source shows the ISP is Starnet (czech ISP) and other source shows the ISP is Vodafone? What is right?
 For example - https://cs.ipshu.com/ipv4/86.49.187.186 there is &quot;starnet&quot; and down on the same page is Vodafone.
 Or can I check if the Starnet use / used infrastructure of Vodafone?
 Thanks

                              <span>So I’m putting together a new UniFi network (I know, it’s not mission critical so that should be fine) for an organization thats around medium size.
 The idea is to put a Dream Machine at the top of the network, connected directly to a UniFi aggregate switch, and then connect that to the rest of the switches in the network.
 The plan is to have two 48 port switches in the same rack as the the aggregate switch and dream machine. The question is, does it make more sense to connect each 48 port in the same “stack” directly to the aggregate switch, or would it be better to daisy chain the two switches. Or does it not matter at all.
 Not really too important but couldn’t find much advice about this online and wanted to try to keep things clean and easy. Thanks for your help!

 I am trying to recreate this paper courtesy of the user that linked his website a while ago. I am just curious how I might go about capturing SNMP queries of an EVE-NG topology in a program. Does EVE-NG offer an API? Can this perhaps be accomplished using HTTP similar to this video? Like the paper, my goal is to model the topology in GraphQL using the LSDB’s of the routers in my topology. Thanks in advance for any guidance.

 I had seen to add Powershell &quot;script&quot; (one line) to disable then enable again the security via NetJoinLegacyAccountReuse registry key. But I am fairly novice at MDT. We are just using a completely &quot;plain&quot; Task Sequence for deployment with no customisation really. Where do I put the disable security step please?

 We got SNMP working no problem, but we rather avoid that. When the SNMP traffic comes across our diode all the traffic appears to come from it. We would need to modify communication strings to know what came from where which is a no go. We already use WUG, but they only offer bi-directional TCP connections between two servers. 
 For something to work we would need a server on the inside to pass across the diode to the outside with one-way TCP communication or UDP.

                              <span>I’ve been a 1-person IT department for a small rural school district for the past decade. My title is “IT Director” but that seems little grandiose for what I do. But I do it all… inventory, imaging, network, budgeting/purchasing, monitoring, security, planning, pulling cable, cameras, repairs, Google admin, A/V, backups… The only thing I don’t do is copier repair. 
 I’m planning on moving back to an urban/suburban area soon and I’d like to be a part of a larger IT dept but I don’t know what kind of a role to look for. I have major imposter syndrome and can’t figure out if I’m over or under valuing my abilities. It also seems like a lot has changed in the past decade. Hell, when I started my current position, the building didn’t have full WiFi coverage and most teachers still used overhead projectors with markers. Now every student has a laptop. Ideally, I’d like to stay in education but just something where there’s more than just me and my thoughts all day working together. 
 I’m just wondering if anyone else has made a similar move and what your experience was like. 
 Also, is the “director” title a liability on a resume?

                              <span>Hey all, I have come across some weird RDP issues when attempting to RDP from my windows 11 machine to Server 2022. When attempting to RDP to the server, I get a response that &quot;Your credentials did not work&quot;. I have tried both my username and the Administrator as well. Both give me the same response. If I RDP into a different machine, then RDP into the server I am able to access it with no issues using either my credentials or the Administrator credentials. 
 Has anybody come across something like this? I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why this is happening.

                              <span>So I have certbot issuing certs that are passing &quot;openssl verify&quot; tests with this command :
 certbot certonly -d domain.com -d *.domain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --preferred-chain &quot;ISRG Root X1&quot;
 But when I use this command, &quot;openssl verify&quot; cannot confirm the validity of the cert, even though certbot reads the sub-domain TXT records, and issues cert contents that it reports is valid:
 certbot certonly -d sub.domain.com -d *.sub.domain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --preferred-chain &quot;ISRG Root X1&quot;
 What the hell am I doing wrong? And no, I&#x27;m not interested in changing my workflow, certbot is not-optional to switch away from at this time, and yes I need to do TXT manual entries for reasons I do not want to go into.
 If I could please get help pointing out why this somehow doesn&#x27;t work, because it should... the error outputted when failing is:
 CN &#x3D; sub.domain.com error 20 at 0 depth lookup: unable to get local issuer certificate error fullchain.pem: verification failed
 (it says the same thing with cert.pem)
 Naturally I have obfuscated the domain for public safety.
 Any help is appreciated! Thanks! :D

 This morning driving to work i got into accident my fault. Driving home accident again my fault.

 Any reason not to go with Spotlight?

                              <span>At my work all the computer users have standard accounts, and I have ADMIN accounts on all the computers. 
 We have a few ESSENTIAL pieces of software (MelcoUI, RDWorks - to name a few) that trigger a UAC prompt just to launch the application. Obviously I don&#x27;t want to give the admin passwords to users just so they can use the software that they need to do their jobs - that negates the whole point of giving them least privileges. And obviously I dont want employees using admin profiles either due to security concerns. 
 My question is: Is there way to disable UAC for these pieces of software so they can launch them from a standard user profile without having to input an admin password?
 Any suggestions on how to go about this? 
 Windows 10 Home - not pro - so no group policy...

                              <span>I have a custom Database frontend that appears to be hardcoded to the SQL server&#x27;s IP address. I tested this by modifying my host file for the SQL servers hostname to point to 127.0.0.2 and I could still log into the frontend of the app and pull up data. Next I set the Windows Firewall to block all outgoing connection to the SQL servers IP address and I couldn&#x27;t log into the app.
 I want to migrate the backend database to a modern SQL server (and test the frontend client to ensure it still works) but other than installing a second vNIC on the new SQL server with the old servers IP address (which is an option), is there a way to modify the frontend?
 I&#x27;m not a programmer. I think it was created in Studio for NET 2004. 
 Edit: I just opened a login.vb file and found a reference to the server&#x27;s IP address. If I change it...how do I...compile the application? Seriously I know nothing. Ideally this would point to a server name so I can create a DNS entry.
 Thanks

 First a bit of backstory: I long suspected that the AP department was just a bunch of busybody hacks since they always found some other reason for their work not getting done, especially once they had several people on a Monday complain that they were at a complete work stop because of a change we did over the weekend... Only thing was that we cancelled the change over the weekend and literally nothing was done to their systems in the intervening 64 hours since they last touched them. We had to spend all day with the VP level people confirming that yes; literally noth…</span>

 I found a registy/GPO that will disable the Windows Welcome Experience but, not sure if that will do it. Testing this now
 Can anyone confirm if by switching off the Windows Welcome Experience registry will it stop the Windows Hello pop ups? If not, what GPO/Registry would disable the pop up?

 I found an old reddit post that shows the notification pop up I am seeing. Unfortunately, no answer in there.

 I received an email Friday from someone complaining about our security software. In the email, they said they couldn’t find a customer’s phone number because the website was blocked and that they hate our security software. They closed the email with “You need to do better.”
 So, after waiting the weekend to cool down, I sent them a reply today. I gave them, and everyone CC’d on the email, a rundown of how many emails and websites our company visits per day and how many of those are malicious and blocked by our software. I also included a list of their not-blocked, personal websites, that are visited from a work computer, which is a clear violation of the terms in our handbook. I also told her that there has never been a time we didn’t unblock a work related website …</span>

I&#x27;m slowly moving business processes to PowerApps/Sharepoint but before I had a chance to finish the user certificates expired and now the users can&#x27;t use it at all. 
 I&#x27;ve found many articles on how to extend user certificates but from what I understand, the Certifier ID also expired (the one that issues the certificates) and I can&#x27;t find any info on how to solve that.
 Mind you, I&#x27;m a noob to Lotus Notes - any idea where I can get help?

                              <span>I&#x27;m the &quot;tech-guy&quot; for a small startup. We use Microsoft 365 for all our email needs. We average about 15 outgoing emails a day and about 60 inward. We&#x27;re small, we don&#x27;t send bulk email, it&#x27;s just not appropriate for our customer base. We had SPF configured, and that was working well (i.e. we didn&#x27;t notice it not-working).
 Last week we started getting &quot;550 5.7.1&quot; errors from any emails sent to a google hosted domain.
 I&#x27;m going through the advice on Google&#x27;s support pages and it&#x27;s all targeted at bulk-senders and so on. We have a 100% &quot;Bad&quot; reputation for our IPs (from November 2) and a &quot;Bad&quot; reputation for the Domain since August. I suspect this is due to some entries in our SPF entry which includes a slightly dodgy hosting company. We use an external ERM tool which is hosted there and I added their IP ranges to the SPF. Since then the email config has changed and it&#x27;s not required to add their IPs to my SPF.
 On Friday I removed all the SPF records bar the microsoft one and I set up DKIM and DMARC.
 I&#x27;m getting green lights on all the DMARC dashboards for our DNS setup. I can see email headers are containing all the good stuff and I am receiving reports from recipient servers with confirmation that my DMARC is good.
 But, we&#x27;re still not able to send to any google hosted domains. What further steps can I take to heal my domain&#x27;s reputation, and how can I get some more warning on this in future?

                              <span>In a situation where I have 90 printers to be installed on network clients, some of these are installed correctly (those via the network), while others are shared by other PCs.
 Of these, I should change the description, in this case switch from TCP/ip port to Local port.
 Through windows I can click on &quot;add port&quot;, and assign it manually. My problem, however, is being able to do it through a special script that changes this option for me.
 I investigated through Prnmngr, Prnport, cscript. But I can&#x27;t find a way to automate this field switch.
 Powershell for internal policy is not possible to do this.
 Thank you.

                              <span>hi guys, i&#x27;ve an old Fas2220 with my VM stored in there (vmware esxi, vCenter etc) and now its really old that i can&#x27;t monitoring anymore because i can&#x27;t update the interface of netapp because everything its outdate, i would like to migrate a new dual controller storage (i see only uc3200 from the newest technology from synology but its a bit expensive for my purpose) 
 so i&#x27;ve 2 problems
 1st is migrate all the VM(including the pfSense..) (and all possible newtork configuration) to a new dual controller storage, better a Synology because i&#x27;ve already another Synology only for backup with &#x27;Active backup for business&#x27; but its just for safe, the VMs Run on the this old Netapp)
 2nd Chose a new one, UC3200 is great but expensive, maybe an little oldest one?

 I would like to change the password complexity and length of validity.
 For example, if I change the minimum characters from 8 to 10, will 500 users have to enter a new password at the same time, or only when the old password expires?
 I would like to change the minimum length from 8 to 10 and the validity from 6 months to 2 years.
 But without 500 tickets at once from people who don&#x27;t understand the new policy.

                              <span>First time poster here, I think this post follows the rules but sorry if I missed something.
 Admin at a small private school, 2 campuses each with about 300 students.
 We&#x27;ve got a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro on each campus, but it seems like we&#x27;re operating at capacity.
 Ubiquiti recommends up to 40 devices (network devices, not clients) on each UDM pro, and we&#x27;ve got 45 on each.
 This seems to put a strain on the UDM-pros, since the CPU is always operating at 90-100% and the GUI-based portion of the OS frequently crashes, and we have to restart the unifi services via SSH in order to get back in.
 Anyone have any recommendations on how to go about replacing the UDM-pros with something that can handle the load better, and have that recommended 20% headroom?

                              <span>So using Linux on the desktop is not an option. Our desktop teams have done POCs with various distros but at our scale, they find it is near impossible to manage efficiently (too many one-offs, surprises with hardware in new laptops, and so on)
 Macs are an option but not everyone is familiar with OSx or wants one.
 So I&#x27;m going to make a case for Windows Subsystem for Linux probably with Ubuntu. Looks like it is just another app as far as Windows is concerned and can be managed as such. I&#x27;m curious if there are any gotchas, security concerns, or things like that I&#x27;m over looking.

                              <span>I started a job last month at a local college as an IT-consultant, and my main role so far has been resolving support tickets and rigging classrooms for online lectures, zoom meetings, among other stuff. There is, however, a recurring problem amongst the teaching staff, where they for some reason can&#x27;t for the life of them understand why they would have to turn on projectors, or press Windows+P to get the projected display to cooperate...
 So my question here is:
 Do any of you guys have any smart solutions for automating these kinds of minor annoyances? I have tried making some flows in PowerAutomate at home, just to get to know more about this type of thing, and I&#x27;m also well versed in Python.
 Any and all suggestions are welcome :)

 I have a problem with the remote access to a terminal server.
 I gave the remote-permission on our TS to a user from our domain like I did with the last for users (where the connection works). But it does not work with one specific user. This user has the same rights and is linked with the same GPOs as the other four.
 When I connect with the TS I get the error that the user has no permission for a remote-login... Has anyone an idea what the problem could be?

One of those users needed some help and for some reason the admin password for that device was expired, which basically never happened with any of the other devices before.
 Does anyone have an idea what could have caused this? It seems crazy that for one guy it happens but not for the other 10-20 people.

                              <span>Hi there,
 we&#x27;re having a standard setup:
  
syncing AD with AAD Connect to the cloud
 Exchange Hybrid with Exchange 2016
  
We&#x27;re having a subset of users, who are external suppliers and have their external SMTP adresses added to their AD account, as an Exchange contact object; they don&#x27;t have a mailbox.
 Background for this is, that we have Apps like Jira and Confluence, where those suppliers should receive updates for Tickes/Sites on their primary work address. Those apps source the SMTP Adress from the AD mail property. I really don&#x27;t like this setup, but that&#x27;s something grown.
 However, this is making some trouble with syncing to the cloud, since those SMTP adresses are already registerd with the tenant of the supplier, which makes absolutely sense. But we need those accounts synced to AAD, because we&#x27;re using AAD as Identity Provider (IdP) for several apps.
 Qeustion to the community?
 How have you solved a challenge like this?
 From my point (Exchage/AD) I can only imagine a solution with Exchange mailboxes for those users with a forwarding to their primary work address. But thils will cost a license in the future, when we move those mailboxes to Exchange Online. That&#x27;s something I want to avoid.
 My preferred solution would be, that such users can set a notification address in the application. But I don&#x27;t know if this possible.
 Thanks for helping!

                              <span>Do you run phishing tests in your company?
 If yes, what software do you use to send out the emails? I am currently on the lookout for a fitting software, but there is a lot to choose from and the companies selling the software all put the exact same marketing stuff on their sales website, without any screenshots, feature lists or videos of the program.
 So. What do you use, why and does it work good for you? Any issues while using it? Anything I would need to know before buying the software?

                              <span>Hep guys,
 I am looking for a solution to have 2 sites connected 24/7 via voice communication. It means to say that there is no need for dialing and the users could just speak over the system and the other site would be able to hear it. I have 2 sites that needs this real time communication system for ease of operations.
 Do you know what’s out there that can do this?
 I looked at those IP phones but I am assuming that dialing and picking up is needed.
 Edited: I do have VPN connected between these two sites so I am assuming the only thing we need to figure out is the system that allows this to work.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We use Android tablets for our WMS in a warehouse-like place. This place has some kind of 1st floor made with a steel structure on top of the ground floor (a lovely location to play with Wifi).
 Tablets have always had issues with Wifi connection dropping.
 In order to improve the situation, we&#x27;ve added somes more APs, changed channels. It did help a bit but issues haven&#x27;t disappeared.
 Recently, we tested some new tablets (for other reasons), and these one&#x27;s had less issues when roaming.
 After some more research i&#x27;ve heard about Rate settings and decided to give it a shot and made a great mistake : pushing the changes to prod before even testing...
 The major changes were made by our service provider after i asked what they thought of it.
 After a ton of user complaints (tablets were almost always dis/re-connecting), i rolled back to the previous rates settings (had screenshot of it). Even though situation has improved, it is still worse than before the changes.
 I&#x27;ve switched back to 2.4GHz only the APs on the warehouse side, rates are the same as before.
 All tablets models are impacted : CrossCall T4 (Android 10), Samsung A8 and S6 lite (Android 12), our APs are exclusively Aerohive ap130.
 Now my back is against the wall as i don&#x27;t see what could be causing this... 
 Any help is welcome

                              <span>From a corp FW perspective, do you see reason NOT to explicitly allow all of 443/udp outbound, generally speaking?
 I&#x27;m learning about QUIC because it is apparently used as part of M365 for some of the OneDrive/SP stuff, and I created a rule to allow it as per MSFT&#x27;s docs, however the more I read the more I realize lots of things use it, and it&#x27;s pretty secure.
 I feel like I could create a better user experience in general for Google/MSFT/Anything in the future that uses QUIC, by allowing UDP/443 outbound indiscriminately, but of course from a gut-feeling perspective, it feels inappropriate to do so.
 What have some of you done? Are you specifying destination criteria / keeping up with new domains/CIDRs for this or are you allowing it outbound to anything?

 If you ctrl+f this blog for &quot;Deflecting Reflection&quot; it appears you could be DoS&#x27;ed, perhaps something to consider.

                              <span>Hoping someone can get me an answer to this quicker than Cisco. I have a Cisco 4331 that lost power and now will not communicate with the smart server. I have fixed that issue by updating the interface and the router shows that the smart licensing is enabled and registered. However when I do a &quot;sh lic all&quot; under &quot;license usage&quot; there are now no licenses showing when I should have 3. Do I need a tac case for cisco to apply the 3 license I need (security k9 and app-k9) or is there a command I can enter to get these registered on my own?
 If I do a sho ver I show it does have Foudationsuitek9, securityk9

 I’m wondering if anyone is able to point me in the direction of a good video course/ instructor, or material for the ENWLSI 300-430? 
 I’ve seen people make mention that the book isn’t in alignment with the exam. I’m going to be taking over the wireless side of our team, so I figured I may as well get a CCNP wireless. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I run the Networking and InfoSec department in an integration company in our country.
 Lately, after we proved our ability to design, implement and deliver complete and complex solutions, and we booted some of our competitors who couldn&#x27;t, we started getting noticed by various vendors who wanted to partner up with us, which is great.
 One of those is Allied Telesis - They have a minuscule, and I do mean EXTREMELY tiny presence in our country as they have only entered our market, but the downside of that is that I have no idea how good or bad their products are, and I&#x27;m not going to suggest a product to my client without knowing that it&#x27;s good and reliable, regardless of how cheap it may be.
 So my question to you is, oh great RNHM , have you any experience with Allied Telesis, and would you recommend them for Access/Edge or Core/Aggregation, Both?

                              <span>Example Network Topology
 Please see my network topology sketch. How would you join Special System A and Special System B with a common Layer 2 domain? I have a routed network, but these devices must have transparent layer 2 connectivity between them?
 If I have a Cisco 3850, Cisco 9300, and a Cisco 3650 in a triangle of routing, can I use a technology, such as VXLAN to span a VLAN across these? Do these platforms support this?
 What if I have a more complex network? Does each switch in the routing path need to be VXLAN supporting, or only the ingress/egress switches?
 Is there a performance consideration doing this, or should the switches be able to handle this traffic at or near line-speed?
 Is there a better way? I have no experience on VXLAN, outside of reading about it.
 ​
 There are two use-cases for this. One is for the above diagram, where I have a special system that must have layer two connectivity. Furthermore, if this works, there will be more than two endpoints, and I would need to provide a common Layer 2 spanning several locations. The bandwidth requirements are low. &lt;10Mbps
 The second use case is to create a form of hyper segmentation, for security. I&#x27;d like to be able to span several VLANs out to certain sites for IOT, guest access, surveillance cameras, etc. All running back to a central firewall, or series of ACLs would control access between the segments. In this network, all the sites are connected by at 1-10 GbE fiber.

                              <span>What&#x27;s everyone using to terminate S2S VPNs nowadays? I was long in the world of Cisco (ASAs, ISR/ASRs) to terminate these in a former life, however now I&#x27;ve inherited a firewall vendor that is less than stellar with their implementation of the kernel routing table. I want to get ideas that are cost effective, as the business I&#x27;m in does a fair amount of 3rd party integrations - and while I&#x27;d love to go Cisco, it isn&#x27;t an effective solution for the bandwidth we need.

 I currently work in the energy sector and required to be on-site everyday even though 90% of my tasks can be completed remotely.
 I hope to eventually get hired somewhere to be at least hybrid. I’m currently working on learning automation and getting my CCNP to become more well rounded to land something remote.

                              <span>Hi
 I always thought the default IPSEC lifetime was 3600 seconds aka 1 hour.. Now looking at a Cisco Firepower Management Center, the default lifetime under the IPSEC section of a Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel says &quot;Tunnel Duration: 28800 Seconds&quot; 
 Google shows mixed results, some people say the default timer on ASA, and IOS Routers are 3600, while others say it&#x27;s the same as on the FMC.. 
 Does anyone know why the default IPSEC Lifetime is 28800 and not 3600 and whether different Cisco products have different default lifetimes? And can you get the IPSEC Tunnel up if both ends have different lifetimes? I know Phase 1 (ISAKMP) can negotiate the tunnel with lifetime mismatch, in that case, the lowest lifetime is used, but is it the same for IPSEC?

I&#x27;m looking for a customization tool for windows 10 to make ideal golden images for some vmware use cases. I&#x27;d like it to first and foremost remove the spyware and telemetry, but after that, configure things like &quot;show file extensions&quot; in windows explorer and such. Can anyone recommend such software for windows 10?

                              <span>We are converting terminated user accounts to Shared Mailbox to retain their emails for regulatory purposes. Now we would like to utilise Inactive Mailbox instead.
 We are running Hybrid Exchange, so to my knowledge to create an inactive mailbox, this is the process:
  
Move the user account to an OU that is not synced to Azure AD while the account is licensed in O365.
 This will cause the account to be deleted in Azure AD while licensed. The license then goes back into the pool and the mailbox is converted to inactive mailbox.
 We can then disable the user account in On-Prem AD and then delete it later on.
  
Retention Policy has been setup in Microsoft Purview to retain items indefinitely.
 My questions are:
  
If you remove the license then delete/unsync the account from Azure AD, will it still create inactive mailbox?
 We used to convert user accounts to shared mailboxes so we have disabled users objects in our Active Directory. If we delete these disabled users or unsync the disabled objects from Azure AD, will the shared mailboxes become inactive mailbox or will it purge the Shared Mailbox instead?

                              <span>Situation: in our business school computer lab, we want to move away from traditional lab computers to hot desk setups, where students can use their own devices, connecting to dock or dock-integrated monitor via USB-C. Students like to collaborate using large LCDs (or even two where there&#x27;s space for us to provide) but we want to get rid of the PCs and let them use the laptops they&#x27;re always carrying with them.
 We want to pilot this in one of our labs, replacing 12 workstations with hot desks. But we&#x27;ll need hard data to compare with usage of traditional workstations to present to management, otherwise the pilot is pointless. (We have all the data we need on the existing workstation usage, via a platform called LabStats.)
 So how do we monitor the usage of the hot desks?

                              <span>A week ago our ERP had some massive issues, such issues that we had to spin up a new oracle database server to move it to due to bad disks on one of our nodes.
 For convince I put up a new server on last Sunday, and the disks were iscsi mounted from our NAS.
 NAS is running TRUENAS SCALE and has a hardware uptime of 200 days which is when we installed it in our colo.
 Scheduled to replace disks in the old node Wednesday, and then to move the oracle server back to said node Sunday, meaning today.
 Yesterday, Saturday, at 09.45 the NAS PSU just flat out died. The entire thing (It&#x27;s a redundant one with two separate power connections) just poof.
 And since it was only for one week, guess who didn&#x27;t make the iscsi connection redundant and make it also live on another of our TRUENAS instances?
 Yup me. The proud moron that had to spend Saturday to call colo tech to let me in, grab the NAS, drive in to the office and replace the psu, so we could power the NAS back on and get our ERP up.
 Even if it&#x27;s temporary, do it right from the get go. Don&#x27;t be a fucking idiot like I am.
 Anyway, just finished migrating the oracle back to it&#x27;s old node with new disks. Time to walk my dog.

 Does anyone have a recomendation for software suitable for transcribing online meetings?
 We mostly use Teams, but sometimes need to you other meeting platforms like Zoom etc. I am aware that Teams has this feature, but looking for something that works a little better, and maybe has some nifty features.
 Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Proofpoint Essential is recommending to configuring Microsoft 365 to direct outbound mail to the Proofpoint Protection Server.
 Is this really necessary or how complicated?

                              <span>If a company asks for help after treating an ex-employee badly, the common advice here is to consult at a high rate.
 This is terrible advice, please stop giving it.
 As a consultant they&#x27;re opening themselves up personally to liability and lawsuits by their former company. Especially if they were treated poorly when they worked there, the company isn&#x27;t going to think twice about it.
 Professional consultants carry liability insurance and have a company or LLC shielding their personal assets from any litigation.
 Making a bit of quick money and screwing your former company isn&#x27;t worth the risk of losing all you have.

                              <span>So a week ago Friday I gave my two weeks notice after finding a new, better position. I decided to leave this job due to being the only on site IT resource, which required 7 day weeks with 10 hours on site and the rest on-call from Black Friday through New Years Eve without receiving any extra pay during those times. In addition this company treats IT needs with extremely low priority until an outage stops production, and kept moving my office anytime someone decided they wanted that space (currently I am in a mice-infested storage closet). 
 I found out late last week that they will not be able to hire a replacement for me until after the new year aside from a weekend temp that has almost no IT experience (weekday needs will be covered remotely by the already-stretched-thin corporate office). This is likely to mean outages that will cause them to miss SLAs and put an already threatened facility perilously close to being shut down. 
 Should I feel guilty about this? I’m getting lots of guilt trips but find myself not really giving a crap. 
 My wife suggested offering to do consultant work for them on my off hours, but called me an asshole for saying that I wouldn’t even think about it for less than $250 an hour.
 Edit: For those questioning if the office moves were real, here are some photos (censored so I don’t dox myself): https://imgur.com/a/CnPwoiu/

                              <span>Our company has a large presence in Asia and the local leadership would like to donate our older laptops to charities focused on underprivileged youths. We have stacks of 3yr old Lenovo Carbon X1s which are still great devices for standard workloads.
 As an IT manager, I want to support this but this brings up two concerns from my perspective:
  
securely removing company data from the devices
 reimaging with a usable copy of Windows
  
We were thinking Blancco for the data wipe. Anyone use this or have alternate suggestions?
 Also, is anyone aware of free educational or charity licensing from Microsoft? Not sure how to provide a legally licensed copy of Win10 on these devices as they will no longer run our corporate image.
 Any thoughts or advice?

When I vmotion a machine the R730 is much slower than the R720. R720 have a PERC H710 and the R730 have a H330 mini. Do you think this is the problem ? Or do you have any idea ? (It&#x27;s not the disk in problem, i reuse the one in my R710)

 &quot;Direct Peering enables you to establish a direct peering connection between your business network and Google&#x27;s edge network and exchange high-throughput cloud traffic&quot;
 So traffic does not reach to VPC ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a few days completely switched off and I&#x27;m trying to make sense of the current state of play around the November Patch Tuesday updates and Kerberos and the subsequent OOB updates and the likely December Patch Tuesday updates.
 It seems fairly quiet on here around Kerberos issues and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because people have installed the Nov patch and it&#x27;s fine, or installed the Nov patch and the OOB patch and it&#x27;s fine, or if everyone has just backed the hell off patching their DCs and is waiting and hoping it gets sorted out?

                              <span>I wrote this in another post but figure it should be here.
 When I first got started in IT I was doing data reconciliation work for a major semi conductor industry. The job could have been automated but the guy running that division ( a completely different one ) did not want to agree to take on task of data modeling every issue out to be resolved. 
 I&#x27;m very gifted and could do it all in a 2 hours but was groomed to stretch it out because it would mean the next guy had impossible metrics. I had an entire blockbusters worth of movies in my cubical and started coming in at 6 pm working till 2 am to put 8 hours in no one would see was just watching movies for 6 hours. 
 Then I got into a feud with an upstream division that logged everything on Friday at 4pm meaning I couldn&#x27;t go to the bars to drink with my highschool friends. I complained once and they said they would stop, the next week they slammed me with double so I just signed off and went to the bar. 
 Over 5 million dollars got misplaced because I didn&#x27;t file the work and it raised holy hell with the C execs. I walked into a strong arm meeting where they tried putting me on the fire and just said &quot;I quit&quot; right away and suddenly they were my best friends and asking me what I&#x27;d want from a fulltime job. 
 I said nothing and trained my poor replacement who was an average joe family man and he literally cried as I walked out the door. Felt bad but I had a strong edge on my shoulder since I was kid.

                              <span>With the neverending release of newer Windows version, is there any point of updating the Administrative Templates to a newer version if the Windows remains at the same version?
 The security team in my company is saying to always update the Administrative Templates despite our Windows version remains at 1809/20H2. I remember reading somewhere which I can&#x27;t find now that it is pointless to update if we didn&#x27;t update the Windows version.
 Anyone has any idea??

                              <span>Hi All,
 Our small organization has been archiving media content with our own tape library as a standard practice for some time solely dedicated to our ingest/post-production footage, now we are expanding tape backup writing for other non-critical departments.
 The other departments have had a few TBs backed up in their &quot;unlimited&quot; (Google) cloud storage using our corporate network for a few years, now we need a mechanism to access the content in the cloud and download them to an on-premise storage machine with access to writing to the tape library. Additionally, a checksum validation of the files should be done after writing to tape. 
 So far we expect existing content to be around 12-15TB for the newly included department, the data is expected to grow to maybe 20-25% per year. This content will need to be stored for 8 years for data compliance, and we cannot maintain a single (cloud) copy for their department, hence writing to tape is a hard requirement here. 
 What we have so far as a current setup is, 
  
Mac machine with an in-built storage of maybe 500GB free space currently.
 Access to the cloud content via the desktop application (Google Drive).
 Standalone tape writer with connectivity to the mac via thunderbolt 2 (We don&#x27;t have the infra for a windows system to connect to standalone tape writer as of now)
 Rewritable LTO-7 Tapes @ 15TB capacity
  
Full disclosure, on our side of IT we have not been looking into the tape writing side until this requirement came up. On a high level, this new project seems to be very tedious as the backup will be of many individual objects, and not sure whether an MD5 checksum for a list of files contained in a folder using the mac terminal is possible, or if somebody can suggest a safe third-party software app. 
 Would like to know what will be the best approach here? Is using the mac as the storage medium the best option also? We don&#x27;t plan on investing in external hardware.

                              <span>Being a Linux noob, I am actually looking for answer of a very basic question related to Linux distributions. 
 When we create an ISO, we have leverage to include or exclude external packages as per requirement of application. Does a minor change from base makes it a new distribution ?
 There are two main kind of distribution, deb and rpm based, which is based on type of binary package file which favor their package manager. But if both are tyrp of binary packages, then what makes debian a debian, and RHEL a RHEL.. actually, what specifically makes an distro a distro ??

                              <span>The other day I posted about how my virtualization environment collapsed; all the virtual disks were detached from the virtual machines when my storage server went down. Anyway, I only recovered really fast because backing up the virtual machine disks is as simple as creating a snapshot or archive file of the whole disk and tossing it onto a longer term storage. About as easy as backing up a file from your documents IMO.
 How do you do physical drive / server backups? How do you backup hard drives and SSDs without taking them out of the server and cloning? I&#x27;m curious because that&#x27;s one of the bigger empty spots in our documentation.

                              <span>Where do I start? I’m at a point in my career where I’d like to start job hunting for another opportunity but feel like I don’t have the skills to successfully find something better than where I’m already at. 
 I’m the sole IT staff for a multimillion dollar grant program wrapped under a major non-profit. Essentially I have a dotted line to IT, but other than back end things like HR and email, I am responsible for everything else. I’ve been doing it for over a decade so in some sense I don’t have imposter syndrome directly in the role, but at the same time I don’t have deep professional IT experience, and just get by on my own. I leverage a consultant for engineering and largely perform systems administration and support in addition to my others roles. I’m lacking in best practices, oversight and auditing, and ultimately feel like an amateur due to no one requiring anything from me other than “are things working?” 
 I’ve managed fine, overseeing and supporting 9 physical offices, virtual infrastructure and workforce etc, but I feel like I can’t get another job because I’ve largely done everything on my own with little direction and just keeping everything working with the bare minimum. 
 How can I prepare myself for a potential job within an actual IT department with IT professionals that likely have more knowledge than me? And how do I accomplish that without going backwards? I’ve leveraged myself into a senior leadership position within the org beyond just IT, with a heavy emphasis on operational project management and strategic planning (non-IT). 
 Ultimately I don’t feel like I have the skills I need to be successful and I don’t want to be where I am forever. I’m a jack of all trades and an expert of none. 
 Has anyone else been in a similar situation that was able to break through and progress? How did you do it?

                              <span>I see a lot of posts on ACI, both good and bad. From a pure networking standpoint, how many of you could say that moving to ACI was a positive move for both you and/or the organization? From an employment/resume perspective, is it worth learning about, OR - is it eventually going to fade into a different solution/go away? I ask because a lot of posts show problems with the platform/solution, and I wonder about the long term viability of the product. I think the firepower/asa branding has suffered over the past years because of issues with firepower, and I wonder if the same will happen to ACI, or has already happened? Maybe other vendors are already have way better solutions? I&#x27;m just not aware of the solution, and how it is currently/ and will be standing against its competitors long term.... 
 Any feedback is valued.

                              <span>I have a task where I have a laptop that acts as a controller to a set of node devices. I&#x27;m using WIFI and the controller sets a schedule for when the nodes have to transmit data they&#x27;re collecting. 
 How do I make the time between the controller and nodes consistent as small propagation delays are not a problem but something like the system clock may cause issues.
 Would it work to use a countdown instead of specifying a specific time?
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Are there any known PoE issues with the HP ProCurve 2910al-24G-PoE+ (J9146A)?
 For several months, I&#x27;ve had 5 Reolink PoE cameras connected to a refurbished 2910al-24G-PoE+, and all of them went offline over the past couple weeks. The switch currently says it is delivering 3-4W PoE to all cameras, but the port lights only turn on for 1-2. In all cases, neither IP or link-layer pings can reach them.
 The switch is also delivering PoE to two Wifi APs and an unmanaged PoE-in 5-port switch. These three things have continued to function fine, with the Wifi APs being online even longer than the cameras.
 Also, the cables have been tested and verified. They are shielded CAT6 with solid 23 AWG copper wire. Should hold up just fine.
 Back to the cameras, I can&#x27;t seem to get the online. There are 4 different models, all from Reolink, and only the oldest one (out of support) lights up a network port. I&#x27;ve also tried them on a ProCurve 2520-8 (J9137A), and it&#x27;s the nearly the same problem, except that one old camera gets CRC/alignment errors showing up in the switch logs for it&#x27;s port. Doesn&#x27;t matter which port I connect it to.
 The only explanation I can think of, and it doesn&#x27;t make complete sense to me, is that somehow a power outage bricked the PoE Reolink cameras, but not the other PoE devices, and not the PoE switch itself. Perhaps Reolink PoE products are less resilient? Is that plausible?

                              <span>Let’s say an existing site (A) is configured with 172.16.0.0/16 network, for a total of 100 hosts in service currently. 10 of these 100 devices are switches. 
 This is a completely private Switched network for now with no routers available. 
 I need to establish management access to only these 10 switches, from an existing Server having an address of 192.168.0.100/24 at Site (B). 
 (The switch management addresses I want to manage at site (A) are in sequence - 172.16.1.100 to 172.16.1.109).
 My plan was to use a new NIC available at the server with the address 172.16.1.99 and /28 mask, together with a static route in the server pointing to this NIC as the gateway for the /28 network. 
 Subnet mask of the 10 switches at Site (A) would be changed to /28 and a Gateway address of 172.16.1.99 would be added to them as well. 
 My feeling is this isn’t a clean solution, but since I’m not allowed to change the addresses of the switches at site (A), this is the only way I could think of doing it. Does it make sense at all?

                              <span>Good day, 
 I am configuring a HP Procurve 3500yl switch for a new Mitel environment using 6910 Mitel phones. The new vlan 50 (ip address: 172.50.1.2) has been configured, ip helper set to the Mitel controller at 172.50.0.2. LLDP has been enabled. I have tagged port 17 with vlan 50 and untagged 1o which is the data network. When I plug in a phone it is unable to pick up DHCP. When I plug a laptop into the back of the phone, I am getting the 50 vlan and an IP. Did I misconfigure something here?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I recently moved almost all of our switches to authenticate using DUO. We had some switches configured for authentication with old tacacs+ server. My method for deleting the tacacs configuration was to first remove all aaa commands and last “no aaa new-model”. In one of the switches, I accidentally removed all commands except one: “Aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+”. I configured login local for all vty lines and console, but now I’m afraid to configure aaa with Duo. (I had a bad experience with one switch in the past - couldn’t access it when I was trying to configure new aaa config because it remembered all old aaa commands - didn’t remove them at that time). Experienced people, what should I do?

 The data being sent from each device to the access point needs to match the time of the access point and I&#x27;m wondering what mechanism exists that allows for this.

                              <span>When it comes to reviewing signal metrics on your cellular routers, does anyone have a handy method or process to equate signal metrics to user experience?
 Signal metrics both LTE and 5G (of course 5G differs with how it measures SINR for example): RSSI RSRQ RSRP SINR
 Example: running a speed test on the cellular router may show great throughput, decent latency/jitter, but the SINR is poor and fluctuating heavily (up and down vs a solid line). This then seems to result in a bad user experience.
 Teams seem more interested in the speed test results vs breaking down the signal metrics into usable user experience values.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I am looking to wire my Small Business with 10GBe (Future proof) and need PoE for roughly 7 cameras and 7 Wi-Fi Access Points). L3 is required for security and Vlan routing. I was thinking to go Unifi which I have experience with, but then stumbled on this FS S5850-24XMG-U Switch. This switch has 24 copper PoE++ ports and is L3.
 The Unifi switches would cost nearly as much and require several switches, where this looks to be all in one and maybe a better option.
 However, I do not have any experience with FS and there are no spec sheets available for this. I hope a few people here have some experience with this switch.
  
 How loud is it compared to Unifi Switches?
 
 Does it offer a web based GUI management or is all done via CLI (I have no CLI experience)?
  Would there be any other options or what would you recommend for my use case (12 - 14 POE devices, 5 additional rooms, 10GB, NAS and 2 PCs with Wired connections, VLANS and PFSense firewall).

Say, if two customers switch their ONT &amp; router then, can the ISP see using some real time data that customer A moved to a different location?
 How the ISPs notify specific customers about the downtime due to repair or maintenance, using their real time location data or original address database where the connection was setup?

 I tried using the &quot;-N&quot; switch (no-delay) but it does not resolve the issue. 
 Can someone explain what this means and how to resolve it?
 I am doing a test from a linux box to a windows pc (win 11). Both using the same iperf3 (v3.11) using the &quot;-R&quot; switch (windows pc acting as server, linux acting as client, but the -R reverses the direction so Windows sends to Linux,,that is where this message happens..not in any other direction)

                              <span>Hello! 
 Back Story is I am somewhat of a novice as it comes to advanced networking.... I have successfully set up OPNSense, a Brocade 6450, and a Ruckus r710 running the latest Unleashed firmware. My main SSID is set up on the AP and is running perfectly fine. My issue is when I got to setup a second SSID for IoT on my r710. 
 Similar to PFSense, I have configured my router with a Vlan, different subnet of 10.0.10.0/24, DHCP server, etc.... The vlan is tagged as 10 on OPNSense. I have done the same on the R710.... I created a guest network, under WLAN set the VLAN to 10. 
 Then on the brocade, I created a vlan and set the port 48 to dual mode so that the tagged vlan 10 and the untagged traffic should be able to flow, but that hasn&#x27;t worked. I even tried to assign the subnet IP to the tagged vlan 10 with no change. 
 The only thing that has worked so far somewhat is when I set the Vlan tag to 1 in the Guest SSID on the ruckus, but that similar then routes traffic through the untagged rule on the switch which does not achieve the true separation I want for my Vlan. 
 What am I missing here? Any help or direction would be helpful! I have been reading documentation for several hours now, but I am no where closer to solving my problem. Am I missing something simple or am I WAY off base on my understanding of how things needs to flow? Cheers

                              <span>Hi All!
 This area is completely new to me. Am learning to implement Azure Cloud Kerberos Trust while also deploying certificates via Intune using SCEP to users on AAD joined devices to enable SSO to RDP/RDS over the internet. I&#x27;d appreciate any and all guidance that can be offered here.
 The goal here is to allow seamless access via RDP to legacy applications from AAD joined devices when on-prem and outside of the corporate network. Cloud Kerberos Trust works to take care of on-prem SSO to file shares, printers etc. but I am having a lot of trouble with the RDP side.
 Context
 My lab implementation involves a 
  
DC - Server 2019 running IIS (for CRL publishing), AD, DNS &amp; CA
 RDS server - Server 2019 running RDS
 NDES server - Server 2019 running NDES and Intune Certificate Connector

                              <span>I recently have noticed I started getting higher Ping/latency when I have been gaming. I wanted to figure out the reason behind the increase as I have recently upgraded my internet so that wasn&#x27;t the reason. 
 On speedtest I noticed that when I run the download latency it is a normal 20-30, however when its checking for upload speeds, the latency is between 125-1250. Massive spikes happen which is in line with what I am seeing when gaming. I had my father in law test his upload latency just down the street and his upload and download match.
 So I am wondering what could be the cause of the spikes? I haven&#x27;t added any new devices that would cause more bandwidth to be used. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>So we manage sites along the retail/hospitality line that have guest wifi. We normally see maybe 1-2 DDOS attacks per year. We do not host any domains, or any services for that matter, that would allow someone to find out the IP&#x27;s of the sites remotely. Except for a select few, none of the IP&#x27;s are SWIP&#x27;d in arin either.
 So that leads me to be believe someone on the guest wifi at these sites does something to piss someone off on the internet, or its a random/driveby/typo. Typically they are short lived, single incident or maybe two within an evening/day.
 Its almost always in 1hr or 2 hour intervals, which leads me to believe its a DDOS for hire type thing. Always volumetric, so dns/udp/icmp reflection/fragmentation. So since its volumetric and these sites dont have bgp, there isnt anything we can do from our end.
 Most providers arent that helpful, because they want you to pay for their DDOS protection service, which is normally at least 2x+ the MRC of the actual internet service itself.
 Dealing with one now that is lumen/centurylink. Had an event Monday evening, then again last night (didnt notice this as it was 12am) and now this evening again. We stopped using the IP they were hitting, changed the NAT pool to a new IP, but they are still hitting the old IP. To their credit they did do some filtering Monday, but said it was a one time thing and we needed to talk to our account rep. Looking at the bandwidth graph on the lumen portal, looks like it starts out at over 1gbps, but then settles in around 700-800mbps, and we only have 500mbps at the site. Im inclined to just go to 1gbps if im going to throw money at something, but they could just throw more DDOS at it at that point.
 Anyone have any thoughts on this other than it sucks? Thanks!

                              <span>I recently took over as sole IT of an extremely fast growing company (Currently around 70 users) Growing about 3 per week. 
 We have about a 50/50 Mix of Windows and Mac laptops
 We are all cloud based and utilize azure ad joined computers. I am looking for the following -
  
A good imaging solution that works well with Azure AD
 A RMM solution that works well with Azure AD
 Patch management solution that is cross platform for Mac and PC
  
We are a fintech company so we will need to comply with PCI and Soc in the near future
 We currently have Business Premium licenses but will likely need to upgrade to E5 in the near future.

                              <span>I wrote this in another post about a sysadmin having to fire someone for accessing a system they shouldn&#x27;t have. The sysadmin I worked for had a red flag come up and had to fire someone and was torn up because the guy was a genius and it was right before Christmas holiday break. We drank heavily about it. Then after we came back to the office he had to clean out the guys office and put it into a box and discovered the biggest pile of pornography known to man he had created on thousands of CDs, disks, zip drives. They found the guy had written macros completely automating his job and spent 100% of his time collecting, indexing and catologing porn for absolutely no reason. 
 If I recall right ( I was drunk when told so could be wrong ) the company had to call the police incase anything illegal was on the disks but it was so much they didn&#x27;t have the time/budget to go through it all. They tried speaking with the guy but he had moved out of state when his building access got locked. 
 In the end the sysadmin got the full fury of the company for not knowing what was going on and the poor admin spent 2-3 months 7 days a week working to create and implement new security processes and traveling to every branch to install them.
 The guy was only caught because one of our female coworkers had been in the adult industry briefly when she was younger and he somehow recognized her ( they said he had a photographic memory ) and accessed the HR database on her home addresse which was monitored by law.
 I will say this for the company. They put the sysadmin through 3 months of hell but once he finished they gave him a promotion and paid vaca.
 Edit: Because people are saying he stalked her. The sysadmin was able to speak with him once via his mother and the guy said he wasn&#x27;t trying to stalk her only to put her address into the index he made. He was brilliant but OCD about data. That&#x27;s what made him good at his job.

I need this server up by the end of this month. The H750 matches everything and only has 1 sas port vs the two on the 755 all I’m using is the 1 Sas. Port so why wouldn’t it be comparable?

                              <span>First off....please excuse my ignorance. I installed Microsoft Office 2021 by using the Microsoft Office Deployment Tool. I accessed the Office Customization Tool by going here:
 config.office.com/deploymentsettings
 Exported the configure.xml file and went to the command prompt as administrator and successfully installed Microsoft office 2021.
 When i go to my account settings in office...the program correctly states that its not activated.
 So, I am noticing that Microsoft office launches....i am able to open a word document and edit it. I can save the edited version on my hard drive. All this... even though I have not activated MS office.
 Excuse my ignorance but i find this unusual that I am able to use the program without activating it. Is this like a trial run where the Office program stops working at some point if you do not activate it?

                              <span>I already tried the steps listed here: that just says to enable IE mode and add these two sites and then attempt importing from the WSUS console
 https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/ https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx 
 It&#x27;s not working on a brand new Server 2022 WSUS server. The page loads, but does not load the way it needs to to import into WSUS. The ActiveX control won&#x27;t load. 
 Why is it still relying on ActiveX at this point as IE is being retired and not included in Server 2022?
 Either you get an error stating an addon failed to load or no prompt at all and it just doesn&#x27;t work.
 People in the comments there stating it used to work and then stopped working and nobody is posting a new solution.
 Does anyone have a new fix to make this work? Different URLs to add?
 I used a workaround of installing the WSUS console on an older server that still has full IE11 and imported the update from there. I shouldn&#x27;t need to do that and eventually those servers will be retired and that will no longer be an option.

                              <span>Hello, I recently started working for a decently large company with multiple locations that does absolutely 0 auditing/logging for our Windows PC&#x27;s. So I got approval from the IT manager to audit all login/logoff/login failure activity and put it in a database.
 So, I turned the auditing GPO&#x27;s on, however they feel very junky and the login failure logging doesn&#x27;t even seem to work. Current issues:
 - Someone logs in and event viewer logs it 4 times and than it says the account logged out 3 times, even though all he did was log in once.- Someone fills in bad passwords, but nothing appears in the event viewer even though the GPO&#x27;s are turned on for auditing/logging this.
 Is there a way to make it more reliable and work? Or is there a better option that I&#x27;m unaware of?
 ​
 Edit: I&#x27;m just a junior network and sysadmin, they won&#x27;t even bother listening to me implementing a paid system since I&#x27;m very new to the company. I&#x27;ve been working on making a Powershell script that nitpicks and exports the Event Viewer data to the DB and from there on to a Grafana Dashboard. However the audit GPOs are super unreliable, hence my question.

 Wondering if someone here uses OpManager / Manageengine for their monitoring solution. Right now, our company using this tool to monitor all our devices, however, dashboarding in opmanager is pretty weak and cant really get good visual or like a good overall view with it... Does anyone know if we can possibly use any other monitoring solution that can be utilize or be use with OPM? or any recommendation to have a good dashboard...

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;re doing a migration of all our mailboxes from an on-prem 2016 exchange server to 365 using a hybrid setup.
 we&#x27;ve been using the GUI in the exchange online admin centre to create the batches for the mail migrations but I&#x27;ve found them tediously slow.
 To automate things I&#x27;ve read online that you can use powershell to speed things up.
 Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to find the powershell commands for a hybrid migration, but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that using the commands for a staged migration would get the same results of going through the GUI.
 The process I would otherwise go through would be:
 EAC &gt; migrations &gt; select &quot;add batch&quot; &gt; give name - pick &quot;migration to exchange online&quot; &gt; select &quot;remote move migration&quot; &gt; select the hybrid endpoint &gt; insert users or csv &gt; pick target …</span>

 I picked up on it immediately and didn&#x27;t tip my hand that I&#x27;d noticed anything but my gut dropped. I looked at his ticket history, checked with others in the know to make sure he hadn&#x27;t been asked to review anything related...and he hadn&#x27;t.

                              <span>I followed this guide but i am not sure about some steps. https://www.howtogeek.com/192642/how-to-remotely-turn-on-your-pc-over-the-internet/
 Here is what i did.
 1) Enabled WOL in BIOS and windows
 2)Got myselef DDNS from noip and connected to it in router settings (DUC is running and showing connection is on, router menu says connection succesful)
 3) forwarded ports udp 7 in 9
 settings go soemthing like this 
 Ip Lan adress - 192.168.1.74 (target PC ip)
 protocol - udp
 external port - 9 
 port - 9
 Source device Ip adress - 192.168.1.255 ???? no idea what this setting is but guide asked for .1.255 ip and i can only put it here
 WAN interface - IOiE_DHCP
 ​
 Then. I instal wake on lan app on my phone. I am able to wake on lan now (throug wifi).
 Conect to celular. Input Dns adress (.hopto.org) as hostname, mac adress stays the same.
 Whats next? I think i messed up eithier with port forwarding or DDNS setup. Any ideas?

                              <span>office365 imap 2FA problem
 Hi. we have an application that uses IMAP with basic authentication.
 and we recently switched from Exchange to Office 365 for our email service, 
 this application stopped working because it requires 2FA authentication from office365, which the application does not support.
 Is there software that acts as a proxy or intermediary? For example, fetch emails from Office 365, use 2FA, and our application fetches emails again from this software uses basic authentication.
 is this doable ?

                              <span>Hi fellas! I&#x27;m having doubt running through my mind for the past few days, and now I just dropped in here for better clarification. Help me through this!
 Currently, we don&#x27;t require MFA for users who are connecting via the corporate network (we&#x27;ve applied exceptions when users log in when their device is connected to the corporate network). But, now somewhere I read, &#x27;you should require MFA even if you&#x27;re connecting via the corporate networks&#x27;
 After analyzing lots of stuff, most of the answers turned me into a dilemma mode. Having to require multi-factor authentication within corporate networks may be tiresome, but if you don&#x27;t require MFA while connecting via a corporate network, you won&#x27;t be able to implement zero trust within your organization.
 What are your opinions on this? What do you do for your Office 365 tenant?

                              <span>Can&#x27;t find an answer anywhere so hoping you can help. My question is when radio waves are sent from the antenna of my wireless device to the router, how is the binary interpreted in the right order or reconstructed into the right order?
 My understanding is that the radio waves can reach the router out of order due to multi propagation where radio waves can take different paths of different lengths due to reflecting off of objects (which are potentially moving). 
 Also, can someone confirm my understanding is right that only a single device communicates with an access point at a time because of CDMA/CA. This allows the access point to know which device is sending it signals right? I realize in the newer 802.11 ax, it can split a channel into subsections and interpret signals from multiple devices at the same time so does it need CDMA/CA?
 Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Hello fellow network nerds!
 Once a year my company gets all our technicians, engineers, sys-admins, etc together in a large executive suite (maybe 100-200 people) and we demonstrate work-related activities that are (hopefully) fun and educational. I&#x27;m a network engineer and I would like to demonstrate visually how 802.11b/g are susceptible to interference from all the non-802.11b/g devices that use the 2.4ghz spectrum. Below is the my design of the demonstration. I could ramble a bit so I&#x27;ll try and keep this short and sweet to keep your attention.

                              <span>I&#x27;m putting together a quote to install 20 APs in a single story wood frame building. The ceilings are hard capped with spread out access hatches around the building. From my experience there are typically a couple of fire rated walls to work through as well. This site is also about 2 hours from me so I&#x27;m factoring travel as well.
 I&#x27;m coming to $9,169, or $458.45 per AP. To me this seems high, but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;ll take about 60 man hours. These buildings just always seem to be a pain. This also includes a patch panel, 3000&#x27; of Cat6, about 100 drive rings, 40 patch cables, 20 keystones and 20 surface mounts for the keystones. The APs will be owner provided.
 Thoughts on this? Thanks!

The router&#x27;s web page is 192.168.1.1 as usual, but it redirects me to www.smartbrosettings.net which works okay when I am not connected to the internet, but goes into that buy this domain page when I am connected online. If you want to tell me to disconnect the internet, then I&#x27;d have to dissect the pocket wifi because I built a cooling solution for it. so please help me

                              <span>Hi
 Can someone give me some advice on where the call manager and SIP voice gateway should be placed in the network?
 We have collapsed core for campus and 3-tier for the data center (Access&gt;Distro&gt;Campus Core)
 Additionally, should they have firewalled? Obviously, there need to be some security measures in place want to make sure the decision we make equips us with adequate security posture. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I am seeing the policy here with following command (prefix CL for exchange online module)

 ​
 But... I do not know what any of this means. I don&#x27;t know what cn&#x3D;ff50 etc means. Is this a user? How do I modify this policy to remove all approvers.
 Very confused. I know exchange, but I guess I do not know it this well. Previous job I would change displayname / seating etc for rooms. Adjust crap in room finder, that was about it. I never did anything more.
 ​
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>Hoping someone can point me in the right direction here... I have built out a new server on 2k19 then 2k22 assuming something got messed up on the initial domain join on the 2k19 box, but same issue across both... FRESH server spinups, joined to domain, adding a role and presented with the following error of &quot;The request to add or remove features on the specified server failed - because requires restart&quot; - I checked event viewer and like this article here: it is exactly correct: https://www.wintips.org/fix-unable-to-add-roles-and-features-on-server-2016-because-the-server-requires-restart/
 ​
 All the way through that article everything goes as planned until step 12... adding Type NT SERVICE\MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID and click OK. * 
 I get cannot be found / added or whatever it says, I tried doing the &quot;add everyone reboot, and try again&quot; same error.... So - I started back tracking and removed everyone and left the NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES and am pausing there... Not sure what is going on here. This is a domain joined server and I am just adding a few basic roles. I have tried updating the server all the way to current, and the opposite of just adding servers right out of the gate after domain join. No dice either way. Never seen this before. 
 ​
 Would appreciate any insight here.

                              <span>Our organization is having more and more people discover Power Automate to improve their productivity which is great. Problem we’re having though is that there’s a growing amount of “mission critical” tasks being run in individual Power Automate accounts. It’s all well and good if it’s just personal productivity gains like automating some sort of spreadsheet processing but when it’s creating or modifying data that multiple people use we obviously have a problem of not knowing where it originates or what to do when a person vacates. 
 From doing some Googling it seems to be a bit of grey area with Microsoft licensing as to whether it is appropriate to set up what would essentially be a service account managed by IT to run all these Power Automate tasks and allowing users access to it. Has anyone else managed to solve the issue in their environment of centralizing Power Automate?

                              <span>Absolutely no hints, it&#x27;s just a CSV on a file share that any user (or service account) could write to. No special permissions on the share or files pointing to who/what wrote these files. We have full admin access to all servers, but there are about 600 in total currently online, and the server names don&#x27;t provide any hints. We know the old admins sometimes set up automated reporting on DCs and CAs, but not in this case. There is no automation documentation, nor descriptions entered on Active Directory objects (not for servers and not for service accounts).
 Where to start?
 Update: A colleague had disconnected the network from an old 2008 server they thought was ready to be decommissioned, but it actually had a shared directory where an old program was writing logs (daily IVR stats). That share had logs being read by a PowerShell scheduled task which filtered the important data and outputted a CSV, which then hopped to another server that had network access to write to the final destination for the admin assistant to get it and provide daily numbers to the CEO, mystery solved and I hate it, but also thanks all, your suggestions were very helpful!

 Anything out there for me to jump onto?
 I was thinking a certification or two for azure and maybe go for Microsoft certified professional. 
 Had MCSE a long while ago but not current. 
 Any deals, thoughts, packages, certifications?
 Ty!

 Since there is no open value anymore, im trying to understand how can i get volume licences nowaday? i&#x27;d like to buy windows servers licences and office LTSC, but they say CSP does not provide KMS, and it seem i can only get CSP licences for server 2022 and office LTSC. so i&#x27;m kinda lost. any help would be appreciated. 
 Of course i searched but couldnt get a straight answer for this.

 I open AD containers and can see the new CA certificate in the NTAuthCertifcates tab. 
 Using ADSIedit, and browsing to the ntauthcertificate item, I can see some entries but cannot workout of any of them is the new certificate 
 Finally, on a member server, I launch regedit, browse to EnterpriseCertificates, ntauth and see blobs. I cannot work out if these blobs are which certificate. 
 I have rsn gpupdate, certutil pulse , confirmed the machines are using pki auto enroll.
 Any ideas, should I just publish them using certutil? I have renewed certificates before and had no issue in propagation.

The MD-100/MD-101 exams seem to be more applicable to what I am currently doing, while the MS-500 would fulfll the requirement with a single exam and would get me a raise (as does the MS-100).

                              <span>Trying to test upload speed to Azure File Share through Win 10 Prof desktop. Win 10 has 2 x 1 GbE.
 Documentation saying SMB Multichannel would detect multiple network interfaces and establish multiple connections on both interfaces to increase the aggregated bandwidth. I can saturate I218 GbE to 940Mbps, but the other I211 stays at 0Mbps.
 I read somewhere saying SMB Multichannel client needs to see two network interfaces with the same RSS and RDMA status in order to use them as the multichannel group.
 PS get-netadaterrss shows I218-V is RSS enabled, and I211 is also RSS enabled.
 PS get-smbclientnetworkinterface shows I218-V: RSS false, and I211: RSS True.
 So does anyone know what accounts for the discrepancy between these two tools?

                              <span>So this past weekend we migrated servers to a new cloud hosting provider.
 I was able to recreate the application pool in the remote application RDS server. Everyone on laptops can log into the application after I setup their remote app web address to the new web address. They login as usual and works no issue.
 But if they try to connect using the RD app on Android or on a Mac using the Microsoft Remote Desktop it doesn&#x27;t allow then to connect. Gets stuck at configuring session and then errors out after a minute. This is when they publish the workspace and login to the workspace no problem but when actually opening the application thats when it gets stuck.
 Is there a setting that would be causing the Mac and android users to get locked out?
 It worked previously but when I tried to look at the settings on the old RDS server it can already deleted the collection (which was strange).

                              <span>I&#x27;m a T1 help desk guy. I have a+ net+ Sec+ and it&#x27;s all I got going for me. I honestly had no intention to look into Linux+, but the only reason I&#x27;m now considering is a thread over in r/CompTIA where someone asked if they could avoid working on anything Linux related and they were met with a swift, resounding NO.
 After doing some research about this, it seems like it&#x27;s true, Linux is the backbone for alot of enterprise systems worldwide.
 Aside from installing Mint and using it for a month or two many years ago because my old laptop kept BSODing on me on Windows and Mint got around that issue, I kinda know nothing about it.
 I don&#x27;t have a solid plan for what I want to do, because it&#x27;s kinda difficult to know what you want to do if you don&#x27;t have the experience nor have you done it before. If I really had to choose it would be Windows Administration or Cyber Security. All I got is the a+ net+ and Sec+, and right now I got interviews set up to transfer to being a cyber analyst.
 I am well aware of the RHSA cert, but just humor me for a second: is Linux+ actually worth it for someone like me that knows almost nothing about Linux?
 If it helps, job listings in my local area don&#x27;t say Linux+ is required but Linux experience is preferred. Being certified &#x3D;/&#x3D; experience but I&#x27;d imagine it helps in some way.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am doing some research in implementing a two-tier pki for our environment. We have roughly 500 users. So far all the instructions online seem to be either outdated or confusing. Does anyone have a best standard guide to follow with instructions? 
 For example, some instructions online mention to create a VM for the offline root ca, others mention that it should be on a laptop with hyper-v, and finally some suggest baremetal, but I am not sure what type of hardware should I use. Ex: Poweredge r450?
 Also, we are 99% Windows shop, but I am interested in linux and have looked at hashicorp vault and step-ca.
 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Skip to second paragraph for question. First part is me just needing to vent. 
 This executive is killing me. Trying to push to moving to sharepoint/onedrive vs a mix of Google Drive, Dropbox, a handful of local file shares that make sense to migrate. Late wednesday night got an email saying, let&#x27;s also migrate to teams and teams phone by the end of the year. My boss is on vacation so when he gets back I&#x27;m asking him to try talk to said executive to push this back. We&#x27;re a two man IT team for a large company. We&#x27;re great at our job but we can&#x27;t make miracles happen. I&#x27;m. personally making the argument that I tend to be a perfectionist and I rather have the extra time to make it a good experience for our end users than to roll out something that&#x27;s half assed. /rant
 That all being said, Bossman and I really need some crash courses for this stuff if we have any hope of making this happen. We&#x27;re good at learning by doing but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s 100 things we need to learn for teams and teams calling as far as migrating and administration goes. 
 Yes I know this isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s first choice, but our hands will probably be tied for making this happen. Besides, we&#x27;ve been wanting to consolidate a lot of the services we have for easier administration, single sign on, all that jazz.

                              <span>Just wondering if there are any sugestions on troubleshooting or testing a UPS. I only have Powerchute personal edition but can buy the business edition if it has tools to help.
 I have the back-ups xs 1400u attached to a small networking rack. Average load on the UPS is 70W to 100W so not that heavy. I wanted something that would keep it up at least an hour and this UPS should according to the APC calculator. I only bought it two years ago.
 I had a power outage for the first time today. 40 min for maintenance, and when I checked on the rack about 30 min in it was dead. It performs Self Tests regularly and I ran one manually today in Powerchute and it passed. Could the batteries be failing after two years?

                              <span>Hello,
 Several years ago, I installed for a client a full highly available RDS farm, and everything work smoothly as far I recall. back to last month, the client has found that when the database is no longer owned by the &quot;regular&quot; SQL server, the farm stop working. So I&#x27;m looking for what can cause such a mess, because in the last 4 years, I did&#x27;nt touch the farm configuration, but the client did (and the client has changed his IT team twice over the 4 last years).
 For information, it&#x27;s a 2016 RDS farm with a lot of RDSH, but the main part is the 2 RD Broker, with a database hosted on 2 SQL boxes, with alwaysOn, 2 RD gateways, 2 RD WebAccess and 2 RD licence servers.
 Everything works fine until you manually (or after a reboot) change the replica&#x27;s owner from the SSMS, then the active broker logs that it cannot contact the database, and everything failed (I waited for more than an hour to be sure, but nothing automatically fixes the mess).
 If I use the cmdlets Get-RDConnectionBrokerHighAvailability, I can see that the database connection is made on the AlwaysOn Listner as expected. The only weird things is that in the registry the database connection is set to one of the SQL servers instead (in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tssdis\Parameters\DBConnString)
 Anyone can help me troubleshoot this ?

                              <span>We are being asked to block dictionary words in our password policy. We are hesitant because of how limiting that would allow passwords. People already have a hard enough time setting passwords.
 Do you lock down on your password policy and block things like dictionary words?

                              <span>We have over 60 Cisco MR33 AP&#x27;s all connected and managed by a Meraki MX100. I&#x27;m not a Cisco certified engineer and neither am I the person who installed the infrastructure, but I&#x27;m being asked to change the Wifi passwords across all the SSID&#x27;s we have. Silly question but will the password need updating on all AP&#x27;s manually or will the new password be broadcast to all AP&#x27;s automatically?

                              <span>Hi Guys, our Win 11 Education is defaulting to English (United States) for display language and United Kingdom for everything else, which is correct. But I can&#x27;t see how to force display language to UK.
 I&#x27;ve downloaded the UK language pack and installed it using DISM, but even then it still defaults to US.
 Any idea how to force it to UK for everything either by group policy or during install (via SCCM) as it&#x27;s messing up the proofing languages in Office.

                              <span>Hey All,
 Looking for on-prem ticket system. Something light weight and customizable. While end users are not supposed to send protected information in a ticket, some end up doing it. 
 It would be nice if it looked a bit modern and has integration with Microsoft Teams for ticket creation and notification.
 I was thinking of creating one internally using O365 Sharepoint and automate. Only 4 admins use it, so in theory should not be super complicated or fancy.

                              <span>Good morning, I hope you&#x27;re all doing well,
 I&#x27;m a rather new Sysadmin (3 months) who has more or less worked my way into Powershell and adding automation into our environment. At the current moment I&#x27;m pushing out a simple task that restarts our EUDs. The problem is, a hand full of devices are claiming to have completed but returns the code 3221225794. This cannot be a permissions issue as it is run with local system.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried as follows: -Creating a new task: Powershell and cmd.exe both don&#x27;t work still. -Using a different account: Runs on local admin accounts fine, but due to restrictions cannot use local admin for all tasks.
 We are running Win10 (x64), and all the affected devices are Dell Laptops. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and feel free to ask for additional clarification!

 &quot;Fanboy&quot; series - IPv6 and NATs - YouTube 
 NATS are good. I use them all the time.
 Keeping on topic with the video and this subreddit...
 Who actively works within an IPv6 environment? How is it? Is it all that it should be and more? Do you miss NATS? 
 Lay it out here for us.
 Happy Friday!

                              <span>I have never used Microsoft Teams before but, I have started a new job and they use teams for communication. I have a work account that uses my work email. But for some reason, Teams always opens on a &quot;Personal&quot; account. Using my peronsal email. I do not want that account. I am never going to use Teams for personal things. I don&#x27;t want to have to switch accounts every time I open Teams. I just want it to open and immediately be on my work account. Is there a way to do this?
 When I log out of my personal it closes the whole application. And when I try to sign back in using my work email it tells me &quot;This email does not exist.&quot; Even though I have been using the work account for several weeks now.

                              <span>After installing KB5019966 or later updates on Domain Controllers (DCs), you might experience a memory leak with Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS,exe). Depending on the workload of your DCs and the amount of time since the last restart of the server, LSASS might continually increase memory usage with the up time of your server and the server might become unresponsive or automatically restart. Note: The out-of-band updates for DCs released November 17, 2022 and November 18, 2022 might be affected by this issue.
 Workaround: To mitigate this issue, open Command Prompt as Administrator and use the following command to set the registry key KrbtgtFullPacSignature to 0:
 reg add &quot;HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\KDC&quot; -v &quot;KrbtgtFullPacSignature&quot; -d 0 -t REG_DWORD 
 Note: Once this known issue is resolved, you should set KrbtgtFullPacSignature to a higher setting depending on what your environment will allow. It is recommended to enable Enforcement mode as soon as your environment is ready. For more information on this registry key, please see KB5020805: How to manage Kerberos protocol changes related to CVE-2022-37967.
 Next steps: We are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.

                              <span>Hi All
 ​
 Hoping someone could shunt me in the right direction here.
 I had a user email to say they couldn&#x27;t delete a folder into SharePoint blah blah blah. Up until, in my dom admin account, I couldn&#x27;t either... I keep getting the error &quot;The Resource has changed since the caller last read it; usually an eTag mismatch&quot;
 ​
 I&#x27;ve got to level with myself, I have never seen this error in the years I have been doing 365. I&#x27;m an owner of the site itself, so I have full read, write, and execute perms.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve got the user to re-sync the folder up to SharePoint to see if it would merge the two and then able to delete it. No dice. Was thinking I might have to go down the PS route to forcefully rip it off. Has anyone done this before? Has anyone seen this error before?
 ​
 Many thanks
 G

Then i removed 3 disks and only left one in, esxi installed and rebooted into it properly. But as soon as i insert another disk into server, it just wont boot...
 So i removed that second this, booted into esxi, and presented the second disk as the datastore, i even formated the disk in esxi cli. It shows up properly as second datastore, BUT as soon as i reboot the server, it wont boot properly with that second hard disk...

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 We received 500 devices like tablets, and phones. I need to create an list of the name, serial number, manufactur and as an extra additional data like components or memory.
 The devices have no barcode and only written serial number on their backs. I thought there is maybe a way to plugin the device and make a software which collects the data and write it into a list. Not sure, All of it is android so I think I could enable ADB on those and somehow with developer mode could get that data but still thinking of options. Our erasure software won&#x27;t delete (and catch the data) as they are ALL ROOTED and the software don&#x27;t allow it....
 Ideas, dear colleagues? 👌

                              <span>Hey lads, I need to backup around 250 user mailboxes from my company m365, but I can just convert them to shared mailboxes and they can remain on m365 without deletion and license if I&#x27;m not mistaken?
 I know there&#x27;s a limit per shared mailbox of 50GB and then I need to assign license to increase to 100GB storage, but I just need them accessible without licenses so we can cut in cost. So I was wondering if this is possible like I&#x27;ve imagined?

                              <span>What&#x27;s your take on personal backup when it comes to your family?
 Situation is 3 desktop pcs/notebooks with Windows 10/11 and Microsoft 365 family. All important files are stored in OneDrive.
 I&#x27;m looking for a good backup solution to secure those devices and files which are stored in OneDrive (synced to pc). Doesn&#x27;t have to be a free software. Thinking of taking advantage of a good black friday deal.
 Do you backup to the cloud? NAS? USB Drive?
 Thanks in advance :)

 Does anyone have any recommended Office365 backup solutions which support backing up mailboxes/sharepoint/Public folder data which is cost effective!

                              <span>Hi everyone, the IT team where I belong has been POCing a few NDR companies lately. Our goal is to focus on :
 - preventing data going outbound without us knowing (data exfiltration)
 - ransomware and lateral movement
 - anything related to AD misconfiguration
 ​
 We tried Darktrace and Extrahop but they turn out way too costly for us.
 My CISO looked up a few other names and Greycortex came up. 
 ​
 Any insight on this product?
 ​
 Thanks!

 We&#x27;re in a bit of a pickle on one of our client&#x27;s infrastructure. We&#x27;ve updated the RDS broker server and it seems to have uninistalled the whole RDS role. Does anyone have any ideas about why that would happen? Also November updates seem to cause some severe problems with RDS connections so we&#x27;re in the process of rolling back on EVERYTHING, thanks microsoft....

                              <span>I want to disable LLMNR and NBT-NS within the network because of possible spoofing attacks.
 I run multiple domains and different forests. Most domain/forest levels are 2016. 1 domain/forest level is 2008. We have a few legacy 2008R2 Servers running, no clients running older then Windows 10. 
 I can&#x27;t really oversee the impact on disabling NBT-NS. How can i audit if Netbios is still used on hundreds of servers?

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 i need your help. 
 We want to add some internal websites with CA certificates 
 We have all things in virtual machines.
 DC01 (domain controller)
 DC02 (CA server, dns etc)
 srv-fil01 (fileserver etc)
 Other servers (running some web applications) 
 now we want to secure those connections. i followed some youtube movies, but each time on my site it is not working. 
 when i go to https:// it says not secured connection, but when you check the certificate it is the local certificate, not the one i created like following a youtube etc. 
 its strange,

                              <span>My current hybrid AD setup has the PDC sync with pool.ntp.org and every client syncs to the PDC which reduces traffic to pool.ntp.org and keeps Kerberos happy.
 If I were to go cloud-only (i.e. no PDC) what happens to NTP? Does every client just point to pool.ntp.org?

                              <span>How are you gents and ladies in large companies (500+) dealing with all the groups that Microsoft Planner creates?
 For those who don’t know, when a user creates a new planner in Microsoft Planner it automatically creates a group with the same name so they can collaborate with other users 
 This is all well and good but my reports have become filled with random groups created from Planners
 I wanted to removed user permissions to create teams groups but our C-Suite likes the collaborative features being able to make a group enables
 I have no idea how to meet in the middle, any advice (oh and Happy Friday!)

 For example, I wrote The Script. I want to share it with tech support, but it must be run with admin credential and I wouldnt&#x27; delegate some permission.
 For python/php I usually spin up some REST API service, and it works fine. 
 Is there a natural way to to do such thing with Powershell? May be there is another way?

                              <span>Hello!
 I’m currently trialling WHfB in our tenant and since I’ve made the switch, I’m seeing some authentication errors (below) when trying to use SSO to some Azure enterprise apps and unable to sign in. 
 “Authentication method &#x27;X509, MultiFactor&#x27; by which the user authenticated with the service doesn&#x27;t match requested authentication method &#x27;Password&#x27;”
 I believe I understand the issue, however where do I change the authentication method to use password rather than X509 auth? Would I need to raise it with each vendor to amend the SAML settings, or is there an easily configurable setting within the enterprise app/app registration itself to force it to use password?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling a bit with this. We have a datacenter location and multiple branchoffices.
 The datacenter is divided in multiple subnets. Now when we do a ping to domain.local on a machine in the datacenter that&#x27;s not in the same subnet as the DC we get a reply from a random DC in a branchoffice. I checked the logonserver and that&#x27;s correct.
 I know how DNS round robin and DNS Netmask Ordering work now. But I can seem to figure out how to get a reply from the DC in the other subnet in the datacenter.
 We use all class A networks. To make it simple:
 Datacenter:
 10.1.0.0/23: Where the DC is at.
 10.2.0.0/23: The client where you do the ping to domain.local from.
 Branchoffice 1:
 10.3.0.0/24
 Branchoffice 2:
 10.4.0.0/24
 ​
 Can someone help me in how I can configure this?

                              <span>(small business so not a lot of VMs (about 40) but still)
 I woke up a few days ago (late in the day because working late) to find that our hypervisors lost connection to the storage server. All of the virtual machines still running without disks basically. The storage server basically died on me while I was asleep at home. After fixing issues with the storage server (some faulty hardware and a failing RAID), I powered back on our hypervisors and started restoring from backups.
 For a minute, I thought we lost all of our data, all of our servers, and were not going to be able to bring anything back online for a few days. But I was able to fix everything wrong with the storage server (since the power issue was due to a PCIe card failing, and did maintainence) and bring back online most of our VMs without issue. The only VM we lost was a test server that was created that night. 
 Although I was able to recover basically everything, I still have decided to improve our backups and retention system. It was a life safer this time but I think we definitely could have better backups. 
 It&#x27;s things like this that make you not regret doing the extra work for backups and fail safes (even if they might suck to set up at times). Made me definitely feel good about my backup systems and plan in case this kinda thing happens. Now I&#x27;m taking what I had before and adding on top of it; since I have an actual reference incident to go off of.

If BGP is only used to prevent flooding of the ARP requests for host traffic (BGP EVPN address family distributes routes to the leaves), did EVPN by itself with VxLAN exist before BGP came up with the EVPN address family and Type 2/5 routes?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for advice on configuration for a second ISP uplink on a layer 2 switch with Fortigates in an HA Active/Passive config. The ISP is utilizing VARP on their end. From what I&#x27;ve read, I believe I need to set up a LACP on my HP switch, and then VRRP on my Fortigate. I&#x27;ve included a basic diagram if anyone is willing to look at let me know if I&#x27;m on the right track. Devices in blue are managed by me, green by other entities.
 I know that we lack physical switch redundancy from ourselves to our ISP. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t solve that at this point, but intend to in the future. My understanding is that I would go from LACP to an MLAG at that point.
 Any recommendations on the switching and firewall technologies in use would be appreciated. I can clarify if needed. Diagram link below.

                              <span>Every few weeks our DNS servers are getting DDOSed which causes a lot of issues and phone support calls. 
 We are a pretty small operation internally but we do support 10,000 customers. So when things go out we can expect 900+ phone calls. And sometimes it&#x27;s in the middle of the night and after hours when the senior network engineers are not here. But our solution is basic, it&#x27;s mostly just rerouting traffic and blocking offending IPs.
 Our DNS servers are old and planned on upgrading soon anyways. We are open to spending money on a solution that just manages itself, though it must be all hardware that we must host ourselves.
 Is there any DNS servers and solutions that is like a gold standard with passively handling these kinds of issues? The less overhead of managing it on the security side the better. Though we still need control over it and add our own DNS entries.

                              <span>Curious to know why people deploy multiple SSID’s for different things. Like, IoT devices on a different network - and end-user devices on another.
 Why is that? Couldn’t you just consolidate all SSID’s into one, segment these via VLAN’s? And provision them per policy? Or is that solely dependent on what type of infrastructure is implemented? eg: traffic shaping, policy provisioning etc. 
 Like, wouldn’t you want airwaves etc? Just curious on this.

 Long story short, I&#x27;m in the middle of trying to fix a network that was improperly setup with public IP&#x27;s.This network was given a /24 of public address&#x27;s and rather than properly NAT&#x27;ing them when needed, every single desktop, laptop, desk phone, printer, and server was given one of these public address statically. The only &quot;security&quot; this network had was no dhcp server.. (Not that I or any of us here consider that security.)
 I&#x27;m currently attempting to deploy a new network that is properly segmented with private IP&#x27;s using different VLAN&#x27;s and subnets behind a firewall. I&#x27;ll be using NAT on the firewall for anything that actually needs a public IP address.
 Due to the size of the IT team here and amount of devices that need to be swit…</span>

                              <span>I work for an organisation which sets up multiple IKEv2 tunnels with customers to transfer a particular traffic from their devices to ours.
 Thing is, the traffic that needs to be encrypted has the source/destination pair of IPs as the tunnel’s source/destination itself.
 How is this setup working? The crypto ACL is based on “IP”.. from my perspective, the tunnel itself shouldn’t come up.. because the first UDP 500 packet will start looking for a tunnel to traverse which doesn’t exist in the first place.. 
 What am I missing? What is it that is making this setup work?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was assigned a new task: build a representation of our network architecture.
 The easiest way would be to use Draw.io or Visio but it does not seem very scalable to me as we have a constant growing network.
 I bet there are other tools that can make the job.
 If I am being unclear, I need a scalable tool that displays our routers and their named interconnections on a map. We have a DB of our routers, their links and location so that can be exploited as well. Being able to have multiple layers (core, aggreg and access) and take geolocation into account is a plus.
 Take care!

I should add that I don&#x27;t work in It. I&#x27;m part of the finance department with part of my duties including vetting purchases over a certain dollar amount and assessing if the purchase proposed by any of our departments(marketing, engineering, sales, etc) is sound and they have done their due diligence.
 From questions I&#x27;ve asked IT team members, Cumulus is considered a &quot;White-box&quot; solution meaning that instead of the hardware coming with the operating system and/or accompanying software already installed you purchase a separate quantity of &quot;bare metal&quot; switches and then load the operating software system on to them(the switches). This sounded like a lot of extra …</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I am swapping out our office network as the previous 3rd party company that was here set up a half-working system. 
 We have Sonicwall in office (firewall + 5 AP) and I was wondering if it would be good idea to swap it out with Fortigate. 
 The reason why I’m working on swapping it out is because the specific AP models that our firewall takes are discontinued. 
 Ruckus was something I wanted but there are also order issues here. The APs and switches won’t arrive for long and I need to fix internet ASAP. It’s super bad. Some areas aren’t covered at all. Even cable internet keeps disconnecting. 
 Fortigate is in stock and available. I can start requisitioning them and fixing office network. 
 I do not have ANY experience with Forti and I do not want to make a rushed decision because of time constraints. 
 Can any of you tell me what your experience with Fortigate has been? Does it support seamless transitions, domain authentication, etc? How reliable are they? 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this. I’ll keep my background brief: I’m still fairly green in the IT field as a whole, let alone as a sysadmin. I have only been working full time post-college for almost two years now, and this is my first job straight out of the gate as the sole IT resource on-site for a company of roughly 250 users and growing rapidly.
 I have some assistance from an MSP, someone who I can bounce questions off of and turn to in a pinch. Outside of that, I’m alone. To say it’s been stressful is an understatement. My company expects me on call 24/7 and everyone has my personal cell and abuses it and refuses to use a ticketing system. All that aside, I want to ask for help, as that is the only foreseeable alternative to me up and quitting. While I have been looking for other jobs, I haven’t actually had a talk with my bosses about how I’m feeling. Mainly because I am not the first IT guy in this role, which has always been filled by one person. I don’t want to be seen as “that guy” who can’t handle it like the previous guys did and ask for an extra person, as I feel like that would just make them look down on me. I know that probably seems dumb, that’s just where my head goes. Like I said, at this point getting some help is the only thing that would make me stay for longer. I just don’t know how to approach my bosses and what to even say. Does anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation?
 Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 Our current wireless cert was created on our DC and then distributed through Group Policy. We have recently started using endpoint to create our images and we are also going AzureAD joined devices. It looks like to get our wireless to connect automatically we need a Azure AD proxy which needs to be installed on a NDES server which needs a Certificate Authority Server which we currently don’t have.
 I dont have much experience with CA and I was wondering if I install the CA if im able to import the current wireless cert so I wont have to push it out a new cert to everyone?
 Also will installing CA break our wifi or anything else?

 We have been investigating removing the archive part of it as we feel it somewhat unnecessary for us as a company.
 I have reached out to Mimecast to ask what happens to our archived data if we downgrade to M3R but so far I haven’t heard back.
 Does anyone here know what happens? Does he archive tab just disappear, do you lose everything you had up until that point, do you lose the view audit logs too?
 I am grateful if anyone knows the process and can share.

 Just spent 500 bucks with MS figuring out help desk unchecks that field for remote users so they can rdp and change passwords since they don&#x27;t want to wait for owa to recognize the attribute.

 I have a decent office chair, I do exercise (running and weights mainly). I don&#x27;t really do stretching or yoga or anything like that though which I&#x27;ve been thinking of trying.
 I thought about a standup desk, anyone had experience with them?

                              <span>Long Story Short. 
 ​
 Old IT Admin goes into Retirement, really wanted to finish a Firewall Migration intime (No one else knows the damn Infrastructure). I did setup everything. DNAT&#x27;s, IP&#x27;s,Policies, handpainted Toplogie... everything. 
 We had to switch the MX Record for Mail Exchange to onprem Exchange. Maybe you know where this is going. 
 Transfered every VLAN. Policies, NAT, Routing to VPN... worked. I was like yea.
 Admin gets a call. I already knew I fucked up.
 Mails aren&#x27;t getting through (Prio Nr.1 during Migration)...
 Guess who forget to tell the Admin to let the PTR-Record change to new IP.
 Had to do the entire Walk of shame back to the old firewall and then also realise that I&#x27;m on vacation on Friday for 2 Weeks. Means no time to finish intime. 
 Misses didn&#x27;t understand a think and I&#x27;m sitting here. Thinking I&#x27;m top notch and didn&#x27;t think about a ducking DNS record...
 Imposter Sysndom is real and I never felt that before. I doing this for around 4 years. 
 ​
 Just wanted to share my experience. GG and goodnight

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for a tool - preferably open source - that I can use to create an inventory of the software installed on our fleet of Linux servers (Centos), such as Docker, Telegraf, VIM etc. Basically everything that doesn&#x27;t get delivered by the base system.
 I&#x27;ve tried searching online, but the only thing I find are inventory systems that run on Linux...
 Any advice? What do you guys use at work?
 Thank you very much in advance! 
 EDIT: Thank you for your help! Much appreciated!

Is there a way to put them to 1 device to resolve this? E-sims do not work, because most devices support onoy 2 at the same time.

 I just woke up to more than 100 United Healthcare statement email notifications and as am typing this, they are still coming in. So I figure something must be going on on their end. Their IT department is probably very stressed out atm.

 I am testing Windows 11 devices to be AAD Joined and enrolled via Intune. The devices have a fresh install of Windows 11 Pro installed via bootable USB made by the Windows Media Creation Tool.
 The Office 365 package is deployed to machines via an Intune Win32 app where I use the Office setup.exe with a custom ODT deployment file.
 When I configured the ODT file using the Office Customization webpage, with regards to OneDrive, the following was set:
  
OneDrive Desktop selected
 OneDrive (Groove) not selected
  
When I view Folder Explorer I see two entries for OneDrive on the left hand pane that say:

 I have a product called MonitUp.com.
 MonitUp measures the productivity of teams and freelancers with employee monitoring.
 Apart from employee monitoring, it also has features for IT teams to use, we also monitor computer hardware.
 We monitor the computer&#x27;s RAM, CPU and HDD usage rates. We keep track of how much CPU and RAM all apps running in the background consume. At the same time, we instantly show the bandwidth used by the computer.
 What more features would you like to be interested in?

 Currently, UPN in Active Directory is in lower case. But we are write back UPN to our HR application in Upper Case. (Ps Script) Now we are trying to remove this script and sync the AD to HR.
 This sync will replace these uppercase with lowercase UPN. Will this cause all our SSO applications using the UPN.
 Ex: [user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com) (AD)
 [USER1@MYDOMAIN.COM](mailto:USER1@MYDOMAIN.COM) (HR)

 We had an incident where a users mailbox was compromised and was used to send out phising links. M365 Explorer shows us the ammount of e-mails sent, but can&#x27;t seem to find a list of users who actually clicked on the URL.
 Anybody know how to generate such a list in M365 or through powershell?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Wondering where i can learn some basics about IT infrastructure fundamentals? courses on udemy or even youtube videos would be helpful.
 I am part of a family business in the manufacturing industry and we have an IT department of 3 people who are quite capable but I do not want to trouble them with explaining all of their work to me. I want to have a basic understanding of what systems they have setup and what they are managing as well as standard practices of what we should have set up for our IT infrastructure/capabilities.
 To give a picture of our current capabilities: we have on premises email and file servers, on premises SAP B1, some equipment for firewalls, and also a direct internet connection with another factory site.
 virtual machines? VPNs? NASs? network switches? What should i be looking up to understand what is happening? what are some keywords i should be looking for? any help is greatly appreciated!

 Fails:

 Could you please help me understand why the signature fails while the key seems to pass just fine? 
 I greatly appreciate your help!

                              <span>3-4 years now first role in IT Support with some little sysadmin level access in the past 8 months and i haven&#x27;t broken anything yet or caused an outage due to an error/mistake such as dropping a database or messing routing tables etc..I feel this is not good and it means I&#x27;m not being exposed enough to the system i.e getting access...The system sure does have a lot of redundancy and careful setups in place but you must at some point cause issues

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I&#x27;m currently having the issue that sometimes when I try to logon to a server via remotedesktop the connection fails with &quot;the logon attempt failed&quot;.
 Yesterday someone else had that issue, while I was able to connect to those servers.
 The problem doesn&#x27;t always occur. It seemingly happens randomly and also fixes itself after some time passed like 1 to 2 hours.
 While the issue persists on one workstation from a different workstation you might be able to connect with the same login credentials at that time.
 ​
 It doesn&#x27;t affect a single server and also happens with different operating systems of those servers (Windows Server 2008r2, Windows Server 2019) two of the currently affected servers are DC&#x27;s. The affected DCs are Windows Server 2008r2 and the other 2 DCs that are not affected are Windows Server 2019. There are also other servers than DCs that are affected.
 - Trying to remote with the server IP adress didn&#x27;t work directly but now it&#x27;s working and the connection with the hostname still isn&#x27;t working
 - The servername is beeing resolved correctly.
 - The affected servers are Pingable while the issue persists.
 - Last Windows Updates of those Servers were in October 
 Did anyone else have similar problems/knows what might be the issue here?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking for views on this and keep seeing conflicting points. Some say everything should be virtual, others suggest a physical DC.
 The issue we&#x27;re trying to address is at present all our DCs are virtual - all our hypervisors are Hyper-V
 We recently did a full shutdown to carry out some electrical work. What we realized is that if the DCs didn&#x27;t come backup automatically for whatever reason with the hypervisor then we wouldn&#x27;t be able to authenticate with domain credentials onto the Hyper-V host.
 Alternatively I guess we could use local admin, but we use LAPs so again we need domain access to pull up the local admin password.
 As a bonus question - we have a Veeam backup solution which is also currently virtualised. Again my question is should this be physical? It&#x27;s not using tapes, just backing up to separate SANs.
 If we couldn&#x27;t get into our virtual environment, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything with our Veeam backups? We&#x27;d have to quickly build a Veeam server to access and restore our backups? Am i missing something

 And if it is open source how do I edit and compile it ? 
 Any help ? 
 We were using paid TeamViewer but only one can use at time and its getting expensive. I&#x27;m looking for a free open source remote control program that I can edit and put some of our stuff in it so the costumers do not get confuse.

 Does it make a difference how to call the exe-file (&amp;, Invoke-Expression, Invoke-Item, start-process)? Or is HP just to stupid to offer a tool which is able to give back a returncode to my script?
 Do i have to play around with Error Out and Standard Out?
 Do you have any idea what to try?
 Thx!

                              <span>Had an email through this am about a forced upgrade of all our MFPs from Konica Minolta (a brand which I think are pretty good) to Sharp and Lexmark.
 I was hoping others may be able to share their wisdom with these two brands, as I&#x27;ve never used them before and don&#x27;t want us to be thrust into agreeing for a product that has well-known issues or quirks. 
 The specific models are 
  
Sharp BP70M75 (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 654)
 Sharp MXB456W (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 4020)
 Sharp BP50C26 (replacing a Konica Minolta C287)
 Lexmark C4342 (replacing a Konica Minolta C3100P)
  
The fact that we&#x27;re having two brands replace one, doesn&#x27;t sit well with me, but maybe this is standard practice. 
 I&#x27;d be interested to hear your thoughts, as I&#x27;ve always rated Konica Minolta highly (perhaps wrongly so??)

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying computer science and came across the hint in an article that &quot;definitive DNS data&quot; is leaked during a DNS query and thus potentially information about the internal structure of the DNS querier could be found out if it is a web server on which an application is running. 
 Unfortunately, when googling for &quot;definitive DNS data&quot; I can only find standard articles describing the different DNS entries and nothing about the security relevant topic. For me this whole field around DNS a bit confusing and would be very grateful for some help or resources regarding this topic.
 I hope this is the right community for this question.
 Thanks in advance!

 I&#x27;m trying to install a language pack on a Windows Server 2019, but I&#x27;m getting the error 0x80240022.
 I&#x27;ve tried to look it up on Google, but no fix so far.
 I&#x27;ve 2 methods to install it:
  
Settings --&gt; Tame &amp; Language --&gt; Language --&gt; Choose Option on the preferred language and click Download below the Language Pack
 Tried to download the ISO Language Pack and install it from there
  
Does anyone have any tips / tricks on how to solve this?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to find the best solution (self hosted) to scan SW &amp; HW through the local network.
 The feathers I&#x27;m looking for are: 
 1.Checking every pc/laptop hw configuration 2.Upgraded HW or replaced One 3.Installed SW 4.Windows version (more details would be better) 5.Pc/Laptop Name and IP address
 The main feather I&#x27;m relying on choosing a product is how the Tool logging the devices, Whether MAC address or computer name or IP address It should be a unique one. 
 Note:: 
 I found some tools relying on computer name Once i format the pc and give it a new name the logs show me new data as it&#x27;s a new added pc .

 This is my first post here. Sort of fresh system admin. At work I have been working on rolling over workstations to Azure and Intune from local domain controllers. We have around 1500 machines and doing this manually is horrible. Does anyone know of a script or any Autopilot situation that can speed up the process? Would greatly appreciate any help or pointers to resources.

 I will start at a new company in a management position and will have about 9 ppl.
 One open, big project is - replacement of an exusting &quot;sd-wan&quot; solutions for many branches country wide.
 And i heard that i will be more or less forcepoint.
 I took a look at it - and was a bit horrified. It looks cheap, it is NOT real SDN. Gardner in the low left quadrant. Compared to cisco sd-wan it looks bad ... So i am a bit worried.
 Are there any good experience?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Our Catalyst 6509&#x27;s are due to be replaced next year - we have around 8 of these deployed at different sites which have 1G connections back to our data centers. I&#x27;ve seen a few posts suggesting that Nexus 9K devices should be used to replace the 6509&#x27;s, there is also a colleague who suggests the same. I was thinking today (when working on a couple of Nexus devices), that they are a bit overkill just for a site? Especially when most of our access switches are still 3560 era.
 ​
 I really do not have much Nexus experience, so I am genuinely interested in what people think and the advantages/disadvantages of them. 
 A colleague and I were speaking today that replacing a C6509 at a site with 2 x Nexus switches in a VPC seems overkill. Especially when there are a maximum of 15 access switches (this is our largest site, some only have 5/6 access switches). We both agreed that a 2/3 stacked 48 port C9300&#x27;s or equivalent could be a good replacement on the 6509&#x27;s going forward. They have 10G access and uplink ports and the pair of us agreed that they&#x27;re easier to set up in terms of HSRP (stacking them will do it). We are also curious to understand the benefits of VPC over standard port-channeling.
 ​
 Sorry for my ignorance on this one, but as I mentioned my Nexus knowledge is poor!
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Happy Bird day all-
 My current Fortigate&#x27;s will be EOL next year, they have been great. I couple them with Aryaka SD-WAN for a East Coast to Mid-West site-to-site connection. (Aryaka has been solid as well)
 But, always looking to improve. Need faster... 
 Currently only two locations, redundant 1GIG links at each location. Latency is site to site around ~60ms RT without Arayka. With Aryaka around ~80ms RT 
 The location on the east coat host SQL servers, AD, Print servers, traditional Fileservers. Things are not terrible at the branch location, but you can feel the delay pretty well when accessing. We never actually max out any circuits anywhere. We are only a small/medium size company.
 What could help me out here? A deeper dive into SD-WAN? Silver-Peak? 
 Not sure where to turn....

                              <span>Hi All 
 We work with video surveillance system mainly network based video surveillance solutions. One of our very old client requested us to get their extremely poorly done network get somewhat managed.
 Couldn&#x27;t really say no although we are already so so busy with other jobs. It is a 2 story building with multiple racks on each floors, we are required to identify each port and label them at both ends.
 Any idea how we can do this job in a speedy yet efficient manner?
 Don&#x27;t really want my technicians to run around from one end to another manually taking out cables which could take forever given the fact each floor has somewhere in between 20+ lan points. 
 Any tips would be highly appreciated.
 Much thanks.

                              <span>Wondering where i can learn some basics about IT infrastructure fundamentals? courses on udemy or even youtube videos would be helpful.
 I am part of a family business in the manufacturing industry and we have an IT department of 3 people who are quite capable but I do not want to trouble them with explaining all of their work to me. I want to have a basic understanding of what systems they have setup and what they are managing as well as standard practices of what we should have set up for our IT infrastructure/capabilities.
 To give a picture of our current capabilities: we have on premises email and file servers, on premises SAP B1, some equipment for firewalls, and also a direct internet connection with another factory site.
 virtual machines? VPNs? NASs? network switches? What should i be looking up to understand what is happening? what are some keywords i should be looking for? any help is greatly appreciated!

 Hypothetical question, but I am looking at ways to streamline the &#x27;network&#x27; as a service in my organization. I have a lot of free time on my hands for the next few months :)
 I would like to ask this forum, what are some interesting initiatives that you have recently done that really made a difference? 
 Or similarily, what are some things that you would love to spend a few months to clean up?
 All suggestions appreciated!

                              <span>Hi, I am new with MLAG and I want to interconnect 2 DC&#x27;s connected with dark fiber. A pair of DC switches in each DC
 Ideally the routing would be local, as close to the source as possible. So if a host connected to DC2 wants to communicate with a host connected to DC2 on different VLANs, it would not be necessary for the traffic to travel to DC1 and back to be routed.
 Is this possible with MLAG? Do I need VRRP over MLAG? Or do I need EVPN-VXLAN?
 Thanks

 Switch# Copy tftp disk_name
 Switch(config)# No boot system
 Switch(config)# Config-register 0x2102
 Switch(config)# Boot system flash device:file name

 Do I have to copy the ios to the slavebootdisk as well or just the bootdisk?

                              <span>Hello, need tips! to implement some security on that net.
 Scenario: 200 workers (mostly programmers), hybrid work, vpn.
 50% workers with client machines (win) 49% workers with office(domain) machines (win) 1% workers with office(domain) Linux
 Workers with client machines need access to internet and at least one local server
 The other workers like other company, some administration, programmers, etc and have his own servers and shared resources. this is what i am interested in isolating
 My first and only idea was try implement something wih packetfence and radius, for begin, create a VLAN for authenticate users and the isolate ass guest users with only internet use (no portal/no auth).
 The problem if activate 802.1x in the switchs , desk assignments are not fixed, and I did not get nor do I know if it is possible to validate an incorrect identification attempt as guest (user with client machine) or simple bypass users outside the domain and accept the radius query as a guest. Packetfence/Radius always block.
 Any ideas for the easiest way, dynamic, and without very specific and expensive software/hardware to implement some security?
 The switchs in this network even above they are bad (dlink), there is one that accept mac auth, the rest only 802.x / port based, they buy two years ago, and they are not about to change them

 90% of the time testing the VPN on a hotspot works fine and the issue comes down to some ports that need to be opened on thier routers or there&#x27;s some other router issues that needs be addressed by thier ISP
 These users are completely computer illiterate. To what mile do you give support to them? Do you call the ISP Yourself? Ask them to call the ISP and then ask for a technician to call you when they attend the persons home?
 What has everyone else done in these scenarions

                              <span>All of Dell&#x27;s documentation says that uninstalling Dell Optimizer is as simple as &quot;DellOptimizer.exe /remove&quot; but whenever I try to run that I get the error that DellOptimizer.exe is not recognized as an internal or external command. I did also try running the command from the Optimizer program files folder. Am I missing something?
 Tried using wmic to do it but that doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize the &quot;Dell Optimizer Service&quot; part and leaves that installed.
 Edit: Correction, when I use the full path to the programs file folder I get the error &quot;Windows Service Start Failure&quot; saying that a Windows service must first be installed using installutl.exe and then started with the ServerExplorer or the net start command.

                              <span>So I was listening to the long awaited episode of &quot;Well there is your problem&quot;, featuring a listener story involving a vat of boiling acid. Which I obviously recommend. 
 And as I listened how very preventably and with constant complaints to managment somebody ended falling in boiling acid, I couldn&#x27;t help but be thankful. I worked in a lot of poorly configured environments, poor security, poor performance, poor management... Who hasn&#x27;t. And I have also fucked up a few times. Who hasn&#x27;t. 
 But NOBODY IS GOING TO DIE if I don&#x27;t convince management to fix a big issue, nobody is going to die if I fuck. Productivity will be lost, Data may be lost. You may get screamed at, you may be fired, your company may even go under. But nobody is going to be seriously injured. And I think that is worth keeping in mind when the pressure gets to you. 
 Please tell me about your deadly encounters with rack closets and boilers depending on a windows XP computer to not explode.

I know for a fact that they are still there pretty much in their full form because trial versions of Data Recovery software previewed them. However, I&#x27;d rather the free command line alternative.
 I&#x27;ve heard of people recommending to back-up a drive as an image first before doing data recovery, but it seems they are usually referring to failing drives. Do I need to back up my external HDD as an image before running such data recovery if I&#x27;m just looking for deleted files and the drive is actually working fine?

                              <span>We have a computer with multiple window users set up. There are few programs that need to sign in using user and password. Sometimes the users, just log out of account but doesn’t exit out of programs being used. So when the next user logs into their widows account, and try’s to open the the same program, there can be issues. Is there a way to auto save/close programs?

                              <span>I&#x27;m disputing some cost and pushing a service provider because they are not resourcing projects fast enough and work isn&#x27;t getting done. They are still billing the same project management hours even when other hours have dropped. My monthly billing has become 25% project management because other resources are not working. 
 While I&#x27;m trying to get them to provide resources I also want to manage their non-value added expenses when people aren&#x27;t working. I don&#x27;t mind paying for meeting coordination and resource management when I see actual work and on really large projects I am not surprised by 5-10% but at this point, it feels like I am just paying them to send me the bill for the few hours I actually get and the e-mails apologizing that they don&#x27;t have resources to do the job.

 I have followed the generic google documentation and attempted this with the “websites to open in alternative browser” &amp; tried “use internet explorers site list policy for legacy browser support” link - https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9270076?hl&#x3D;en
 I manually downloaded the add in and made sure it was running in IE. The switch to chrome is just not happening.

 TLDR: Doing 7 full time jobs across all aspects of technology with entry level T1 support salary. If it has power or IP, it belongs to Technical Services.
 Sitting in my office at home &quot;recovering&quot; from week 7 of pneumonia paired with Covid. The day before the business is &quot;closed for Thanksgiving weekend&quot; but we all know that doesn&#x27;t matter when you are on call 24/7/365. I have not worked less than 60 hours a week, including my vacations, since January. That&#x27;s right, in the mountains, at a camp with no power or water for some family time. The phone still rings for absolute nonsense. I actually heard my phone ring in the shower last night. Wasn&#x27;t actually ringing but I swear I heard it.

 Had one today. Amongst the many hats I wear I am the SME for the IBM i. And I would like to think I know a thing or two about it, having worked with them for close to 25 years.
 The current system I built from the ground up but as it had a lot of new technology on it that I was not familiar with (and that I wear too many hats and have so much else to do) so we had a vendor set this thing up
 Went live in January, so much of an improvement on the old system (which is worthy of another thread). Worked like a champ ever since.

                              <span>I recently got &quot;promoted&quot; at my company but actually got screwed over and left as the only IT person for a business unit that was sold. Was doing desktop support, junior administration tasks. However at once I was left in charge of everything, management, budgets, helpdesk, desktop support, server admin, network admin/engineer, network security, citrix, vmware, O365 admin, you name it. 
 I was only given a small raise but not what people that are responsible for this make. Worst thing is that it&#x27;s not actually these advanced tasks killing me but the day to day helpdesk/desktop support. The company is fairly large for a one person plus on insane embarking of growing fast - so lots of changes, openings, purchases of small companies, onboardings non-stop. Management is abusive as well.
 People are quitting left and right this place. Think of what the media says of twitter, but not twitter. 
 in any case, they won&#x27;t hire anyone else, in fact I can barely make purchases. 
 I&#x27;ve figured is a losing battle and is mentally breaking me. I&#x27;ve spent about past 2 or 3 months working 12 hour days, stressed, working weekends, have pulled about 3 all nighters and work 12 hours next day, no extra pay, etc.
 I was doing it because it was the chance of a lifetime for me to get out of &quot;desktop support&quot;, but have only been able to get my feet wet in everything of the advanced items. So far I have been successful but the low wage along with the abuse and the work overload have made me decide I can&#x27;t do it anymore.
 ​
 However I feel stuck, I don&#x27;t want to go back to desktop support as that will lower my wage more, but I can&#x27;t get a full system administration, network administration role as I&#x27;m no expert in these and I don&#x27;t know what to do. Have been applying to jobs and have an interview next week, but any advice is appreciated, I&#x27;m truly in a desperate situation.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 Want to get your thoughts on datacenter switches, specifically between Aruba and Dell. Specifically I am looking at the Dell 4128 vs 6300M models.
 Dell is priced very well with 5 years support and prodeploy included. Everything looks great with them and all my servers and SANs are Dell. Some have said some negative things about Dell switches on this forum, weird CLI, difficult to work with, but those comments seem to be related more to OS9/Force10 and not OS10.
 On the other hand, all my access switches are Aruba and they have been flawless. Ive heard a lot of good things about Aruba and they were rated very well in the 2021 gartner report for wired and wireless LAN. Dell doesn&#x27;t even seem to rank on this report. The Aruba quote is around 1.7x the price of the Dell quote. 
 I&#x27;m running Cisco currently. They aren&#x27;t a contender because they absolutely blew the doors off with their price. I&#x27;m talking 5 times the others. I almost laughed at our MSP on the call. 
 Are any of you running Dell datacenter switches, specifically with OS10? Anyone running Aruba? How has it been for you?

                              <span>This is the second workstation that I have seen this issue happen on. No idea where the issue is. 
  
Workstation A can ping Workstation B by name and it responds with the correct IP. 
 NSLookup for Workstation B while on Workstation A is showing correct info. 
 Workstation A can RDP to other workstations and servers by name without issue. 
 Workstation A can RDP to Workstation B via IP
 Workstation C can RDP to Workstation B by name using same credentials that user on Workstation A is using. 
 Workstation A cannot RDP to Workstation B with other users credentials (that are successfully able to RDP from other workstations) when RDP via IP. 
  
Cleared RDP Connection History following this article. Cleared Windows Credential Manager stored passwords. 
 Not sure if anyone else has run into this recently.
 Edit: 
 Issue seemed to have fixed itself with just time it appears. I followed up with a client from a few days ago that was having this issue and tried connecting via workstation name and it worked. Just tried again with the Workstation A that I was troubleshooting this morning, and it worked again. No reboot was done on anything. As people have suggested it may be related to the Kerberos update.

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively new to the linux side of things, I switched my homelab over from mostly windows to almost pure linux to really learn it. I recently started dabbling in ansible and holy hell, it feels like I unlocked a cheat code. I can do things that would normally take me half hour+ to just as long as it takes to type the command out. My whole infra can be updated immediately, and I can make any change I want instantly to as many or as few servers as I want.
 I recently stood zabbix up, and I was able to get snmpd installed, configured, and the firewall ports opened opened on all dozen or so of my vm&#x27;s by just typing out a playbook. I was so proud of myself when I checked the systems I ran it against and everything was exactly how I had specified in the playbook. I&#x27;ve still a lot to learn about ansible, but I really am kicking myself now for not looking at it sooner. I want to try and look into deploying new vm&#x27;s with it next and work on automating a lot of tasks like updates, and get a better understanding of grouping devices.
 Learning linux has made me really loathe working with windows at my job, and I hope to one day make the jump to linux administration.

 today I am having a lot of Win 2016 clients having high cpu/disk usage. The C:\Windows\Softwaredistribution folder has 60.000-70000 files. Updates are downloaded from WSUS.
 Have you experienced this? Do you have any idea?

There was a general account that had access to everything in the event something broke ontop of the built in Administrator account. 
 Is this possible to do through the user delegation settings in AD?

                              <span>Hello,
 Everything, was working fine till these November updates. 
 I am using a DC with WS2012 R2 and after I installed the updates of November, domain users are taking a very long time to login or to log off on the domain PCs. Also, we can not access the shared drives. Sometimes it works when we access them trhough IP, but it does not work anymore with the server name. 
 I installed also the OOB, but no luck. Also I added this reg. but no success. 
 reg add &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\kdc&quot; /v ApplyDefaultDomainPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f 
 I will try to uninstall once again both the updates, but I do not have high hopes.
 Do you guys have an idea? what we can do to fix this?
 Best Regards,

 Google (or myself) has failed me in this. Anyone know a method off the top of their head? The values are there in the aad portal gui, surely there must be a way to pull them.

                              <span>Hello,
 Wondering if any of you can recommend me some documentation tool.
 I would like to add some servers/services/accounts/certificates/etc and link them.
 Then for example if I search for some specific account(service) I will see which servers it is used on and which services are being affected when I change pw. etc..
 Best if free tool, can be selfhosted.
 ​
 Many thanks for time and suggestions!

                              <span>Hey there, I have a hard drive which kinda behaves strange. When I write a new file to it, it seems like it did it okay. After a restart, or a unmap drive letter, map drive letter the file is gone. Sometime files are also looks corrupted, for instance a preview is shown, but I am unable to open it. When I try to copy the files to a new location it often shows errors for files I am able to open. 
 I desperatly need most (if not all) files on this hard drive (of course there is no fking backup, thanks to the prev sysadmin). Also the company won’t pay any money for a hard drive recovery service because some files are sensitive.
 My question is, would it solve my issues if I use a hard drive cloning device (will the files be corrupted even then?) , or shall I try some software like Acronis True Image? Please help me get these files back, my job depends on it.

                              <span>Hello,
 I would like to move few SSD Discs between two HP Servers (server A and server B - same model). I&#x27;ll do that on powered off servers. From those discs within server A there is a fixed volume created within Windows Server with files saved on this volume. After move operation will I be able to see and access the same fixed volume data on server B? I would like to avoid data copy operation between those servers because those disc will be moved between server permanently. Any feedback appreciated.

                              <span>I noticed 3 servers in 1 domain, all virtuals, hang on shutdown. It doesnt matter which way I shut them down, via proxmox menus, if I rdp in and select shutdown, etc. It gets to where it says &#x27;shutting down&#x27; and hangs.
 If I do a restart instead, it restarts as you would expect. Shows all the same things as it goes down, but instead of &#x27;shutting down&#x27; says &#x27;restarting&#x27; and it does.
 No windows updates were done this month.
 Other virtuals in a different domain on the same proxmox server work correctly.
 vms are a mix of windows 2016 and 2019.
 I don&#x27;t know where to even start looking.

                              <span>Hi, 
 so we have a little problem and I hope the combined wisdom of the sub can help. We plan to put up some iPads with &quot;Guided Access&quot; (see https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/guided-access-ipada16d1374/ipados) in branch locations and a webpage where visitors can give feedback. Network is achieved by a data SIM in the iPad.
 This is all working good, but now we are looking for a way to remotely unlock the devices, update it to the last iOS version and lock it again. 
 We looked at using an MDM like https://jumpcloud.com/ or a remote tool like TeamViewer, but so far we were not successful. There does not seem to be an option in jumpcloud to force an update and the remote tools could only view the screen but you could not interact let alone deactivate guided access and reactivate it. 
 Does anybody have a solution for this kind of problem?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I am wondering if there is an easy method to audit or confirm within either Azure AD portal or Office 365 Admin Center what methods is used by staff for MFA. (Ex. If its set for phone call to office/external number, using SMS or Microsoft Authenticator.) Based on documentation that I found, you can search within Azure AD portal to determine using the Sign-In Event triggers on an individual employee basis but wondering if there was something more detailed.
 Thanks in advance.

 And sort them based on if they&#x27;re cloud or synced from on prem (because I am going to set attributes depending if they&#x27;re on prem or not, since I will need to due to aad objects not being modifiable if synced from on prem)
 Was thinking of using a switch statemen based on the object existing or not in on prem, but wondering if there is a better more reliable way

                              <span>We have around 10 virtual machines mostly running debian with a variety of apps, LAMP, Splunk, Jenkins, Open maps etc. Hosting is a bit expensive for us as we have a virtual machine per instance.
 Current spend on 8 cloud servers per month is around £700 so looking to reduce that if possible.
 The idea is to reduce hosting cost and standardise to docker containers so developer and release process is easier.
 I have some Docker knowledge, but little Docker Swarm/K8s knowledge, I would rather not maintain the infrastructure if possible.
 I&#x27;m interested in a setup that would provide some redundancy/resilience for us - none of the servers have high traffic.
 I&#x27;ve looked at self hosted docker swarm, AWS ECS, Vultr, sloppy.io.
 Best solution I have in mind at the moment is to private rent a meaty server from Hetzner and setup docker on there, but this fails to give any redundancy in case that server fails.

 I am just unsure what I would be looking for to enable something like this. As you can imagine teachers use this quite a lot.
 I am an engineer, computer science teacher and former networking teacher and sometimes its the most basic of IT questions that trip you up...anyone ever had to figure this one out?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am redesigning a technical interview for a windows role.
 So what I&#x27;ve done in the past is have someone use it locally on a laptop with vagrant and creating a Linux desktop for the testing area and also a Linux webserver that is broken for them to debug. Used no machine before as well. 
 Now, I am in a windows env and have azure to utilise. Does anyone know if I could use vagrant images reliably or if there is a best way to do this in Azure cli? I&#x27;m happy to learn powershell for this too.
 I want to be able to spin up the set up for consistency for each new candidate.
 Thanks in advance.

 We&#x27;d rather not turn off AutoComplete as it&#x27;ll create more issues...if they aren&#x27;t checking properly now, I doubt things will improve when they have to manually enter address or rely on dist groups.
 We thought about an &#x27;are you sure&#x27; popup when clicking send but that&#x27;ll just be ignored.
 Anyone found a solution to this or are users gonna user?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just wanting to get some of your input about this, a client has asked me a job spec as I&#x27;ve recommended they hire a full time IT presence rather than fully relying on my MSP as there are too many gaps in the infrastructure that would be too expensive to sort via the MSP. 
 They currently don&#x27;t have any IT staff so it would be a sole role with general support stuff, maintaining infrastructure, going ahead with minor upgrades, creating documentation and standardising some operations. With the MSP dealing with a lot of the larger upgrades, projects, patching, auditing and improvement recommendations.
 The infrastructure is quite small, manageable and not too complex but with a lot of room and time to learn and progress personally. I&#x27;m just wondering what job title you would expect to see this as? Part of me thinks it should be IT manager since they&#x27;ll be the only onsite IT responsibility. On the other hand a lot of it will be dealt with by the MSP and the tasks required wouldn&#x27;t require a seasoned manager as the MSP will be a fall back, so it seems like a good role for someone somewhat experienced to step up in terms of responsibility.
 Just wondering what your thoughts and points are? I don&#x27;t want to recommend hiring a SysAdmin and them falling out of depth, being underpaid for the job and unhappy but on the contrary, I don&#x27;t want to tell my client to overspend on someone who is overqualified and would get bored.

Got about 5/6 years experience and I&#x27;d describe myself as a cloud engineer although I have the title devops engineer (changing to SRE as its more accurate). I&#x27;m thinking about switching jobs and the thought of applying for other jobs is daunting. I&#x27;ve seen Theres technical tests and even though I know random tools like terraform/ansible I wouldnt say I&#x27;m fluent in them. What ever it is you need done I can probably get it done. How do you guys beat that imposter feeling syndrome?

                              <span>Howdie all,
 it&#x27;s all very new. Info is a bit scant. And as we are about to buy some more (if we actually have to). I&#x27;d be really grateful for some answers if anybody knows. Resellers sometimes don&#x27;t know/understand everything correctly. Beeing able to fact check them is always a good idea.
 Our reseller is pretty solid, so I doubt they&#x27;ll do the &quot;get it wrong on purpose to sell more expensive packages&quot;... 
 ​
 So starting October Windows Server can be licensed per virtual core. With a minimum of 8 virtual cores per VM.
 Question 1:
 When they say virtual cores do they really mean virtual &quot;cores&quot; or do they mean virtual threads. Basically can I have a vm with 16 threads assigned and only use a 8 core licenses?
 With physical cores it was actual cores. So our 2x16C server has 32 Cores and we needed 32 core licenses. But could use 64 threads as they are all multithreaded.
 ​
 Question 2:
 Are existing physical core licenses we have now automaticall virtual core licenses as well?
 We have 32 Core licenses. Which allowed us to run 2 windows servers maximum. If they are now virtual core licenses as well. We could theoretically run 4 windows servers with 8 cores each.
 ​
 Question 3:
 All client/device CALs need to be either subscription or with SA. is another prereq from what I gathered.
 Is that referring to windows server CALs only. Or exchange CALs as well. What about RDP CALs?
 Our windows server and exchange CALs have SA so we are good with those. But our RDP CALs do not. Will that preclude us from using these new virtual core licenses for an RDP server?
 ​
 any feedback most appreciated

 Trying to configure a VLAN interface in OSX Monterey 12.6 with D-Link DUB-E250 (it is using Apple&#x27;s NCM class driver)
 From Network -&gt; Manage Virtual interfaces -&gt; + New VLAN
 And the adapter isn&#x27;t showing in the &quot;Interface&quot; dropdown.
 Anyone ever hit an issue like this? 
 Creating VLAN in the terminal with ifconfig . But it is a cumbersome solution.
 I have another cheapo USB ethernet dongle which is using Apple&#x27;s ECM network driver and it appears in that dropdown. 
 Any ideas appreciated!
 Thank you

 I&#x27;m running a HTTPS proxy via gluetun on a local VM. Traffic within the VM can communicate with the proxy by using localhost port 1234. From the VM, I have a reverse SSH shell open to my local machine over port 4321, and using that connection, I can SSH back to my VM from the local machine.
 What&#x27;s the magic SSH incantation I need to allow local machine traffic to tunnel through SSH to my VM and use the gluetun proxy?
 Thanks!

                              <span>So just got the go ahead to start looking for a new ticketing system
 We currently use Jira, version 7.5...... Support is going to work us out a pretty little bill.
 Main things we need,
 Process clients mails coming in , Assign them to a company/user etc, add it to a relevant queue,
 Example, I mail in (marbro@reddit.com) to Itsupport@cheapcompany.com and it slaps it in the IT queue as Marbro ticket logger, and under Reddit as company.
 If i mail support@cheapcompany, it goes into the support queue.
 What suggestions do you guys have?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for an alternative to Microsoft Sharepoint as the more I use it, the more I hate it. It&#x27;s really bad.
 So I&#x27;m looking for a paid alternative with multi-language support. Our Intranet pretty much exists of a website with a menu that leads to different categories and pages, a site content database and a good looking homepage.
 The most important thing is the homepage since our employees see it first. In sharepoint, we have a cascade of 5 visual items of the latest news, under that the most important events in the upcoming week(s) and under that some handy links that they can click on.
 So looking for something similar to that, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be an interactive workspace where employees can share files, work together, etc. A simple, but functional and good looking Intranet website would do. And yeah, it needs to be multilingual. Any suggestions?
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>According to a 2017 study by the Ponemon Institute, 1 in 4 businesses is likely to experience a data breach. 
 When it comes to protecting sensitive or confidential information, there is a lot at stake given that firms were forced to pay an average cost of $3.62 million per data breach in 2017.
 Giving employees unrestricted access to company files via their personal devices (smartphones, tablets, and laptops) is not a sound data security practice, even if it doesn&#x27;t take a smartphone to compromise crucial records. Unfortunately, that is exactly what takes place when businesses don&#x27;t set their own BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy.
 You may be delaying because you fear your staff won&#x27;t like it, or you may be choosing avoidance over acceptance.
 This video series will break all the Myth around BYOD.

                              <span>Good morning from the wet, windy, wild UK, fellow Sysadmin&#x27;s. 
 In creating my YT / LinkedIn content for the M365 world and seeking new solutions to problems, I came across a really handy PowerShell module I&#x27;d like to share with you: IntuneBackupAndRestore. 
 Find it on Github here: https://github.com/jseerden/IntuneBackupAndRestore
 It&#x27;s a module which is written specifically to backup your Intune instance; policies, script contents, settings catalogs, admin templates.. It seems pretty full featured. It hasn&#x27;t been maintained for over a year, and I haven&#x27;t yet tested a restore.. But essentially the tool:
 1) Connects to your tenant
 2) Exports all the config into JSON
 3) Organises that into folders
 4) Puts it on any storage you can access
 I&#x27;ve tested the backup in my (very small) tenant, and it seems to work really, really well. 
 There&#x27;s full documentation for the module in the repo for further reading, just wanted to make people aware of it&#x27;s existence.
 Remember; MS don&#x27;t back any of this stuff up. If you made a mistake or some disgruntled, over privileged monkey trashes your environment the day they leave, they won&#x27;t help you. Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? No. 
 Personally, I&#x27;m going to setup some Azure storage and then automate the script to run once a week and export everything there. 
 Hope someone finds this useful. Happy hump day!

 2nd liner here, am new to using the SPMT, got some warnings re invalid names and items being empty. 
 I can pull a scan log to detail what items have the issues, are these issues self-correcting when I migrate, for example, will the tool just remove the character or not migrate the file at all?

                              <span>Is there a way to import .reg files from script (powershell) that is runned on Logon of current user.
 I have disabled user to have permissions to regedit so i need to run it as Admin but to apply the regs on current logged user.?
 My attemp was bellow, but it&#x27;s just not working.
 $username &#x3D; ((Get-WMIObject -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem).Username).Split(&#x27;\&#x27;)[1]
 $password &#x3D; &#x27;S3CR3T&#x27;
 $securePassword &#x3D; ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
 $credential &#x3D; New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword
 Start-Process -filepath &quot;$env:windir\regedit.exe&quot; -Credential $credential -Argumentlist @(&quot;/s&quot;, &quot;\&quot;\domaincontroller\Regs\T.reg&#x60;&quot;&quot;)&#x60;
 ​
 To point out this is becouse iam lazy and i dont want to convert every reg-file update ( for win11 ) manualy , the idea is to just import it via script and redownload new reg file from source.Simple clean, otherwise i need to manualy go download convert it to XML and import it in GPO.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I need a Windows 10 image with non-predefined language, meaning it should be possible to select the language on first boot up. I just saw that multilanguage images are only for companies using volume licensing to edit the images manually? Is that right or am I missing something?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>So in my business I use to use App Password Generation in Gmail to create a client email for backup notifications from my clients backup software to myself and/or to the client. A while ago Gmail locked down their services so you can no longer use that feature labeling it a &quot;security update&quot; when they removed it. I moved over to yahoo and it was working up until about 4-6 months ago. They are doing the samething now but lying about it saying feature is disabled for &quot;a redesign&quot; but its been disable for like 4-6 months now...
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for a free email provider that allow 3rd party app usage. If that requires app password generation thats fine but it needs to be a free feature included with basic free mail.
 Anyone recommend any free email host providers that will allow this function? Obviously ones that are not gmail or yahoo.
 At one point I was looking into proton mail but I forgot why that wasn&#x27;t going to work. I think there was an email sent limit or something that turned me off from using it.

 I enabled split-tunnelling by unchecking “Use default gateway on remote network” . 
 I can connect to the VPN fine but I cannot ping or RDP to any remote devices. However, I can access my local internet. 
 Could somone please tell me what else I need to do after enabling split-tunneling? By disabling split-tunneling I can ping and RDP to any remote device.

                              <span>So learning and getting certified for a role that have no experience in, how useful is it to land a job and how good is the retention of all this information?
 Is it better to just try to learn these items on the job or seek jobs that will enable to land the next role rather than studying?
 I guess my question is, how effective is studying to actually land a role with 0 experience. And I don&#x27;t mean studying items that one has hands on access to, definitely good to lay good foundations one has access to, but actually studying things that one has no access to other than labs, etc.
 Are certifications for people that are in the role to prove their knowledge with a brief refresh? or do they help at all in landing a better job with no prior experience in that field where certified.

It took us a minute to figure out that she was digging them out of spam.
 We are a GSuite shop and unless I want to buy an additional spam filter there isn&#x27;t much more I can do. My boss has unequivocally called her an idiot, told her to stop digging in spam for shit or she will find it.
 Is my boss wrong? Can we do more? Should we do more? Do you too have users like this?

 Just got the response looks like they were doing work and when they flipped on the other half of the DC it shut the whole DC down 
 TLDR; stagger your server power on times to prevent power surges. 
 RFO:
 On November 23, 2022 at 02:41 GMT, CenturyLink identified a service impact in Orlando, FL. Operations Center (NOC) was engaged to isolate and investigate the cause of the outage. Initial analysis showed that a power failure in the Orlando area was the cause of the outage. The local power company repaired the commercial power but when all systems in the office tried to restore at once, the power surge tripped the main power breakers. Field Operations were onsite and reset the breakers to restore service at 03:36 GMT on November 23, 2022. The NOC will continue to monitor the alarms to ensure stability has been achieved.

 I&#x27;ve read many &quot;marketing&quot; articles from migration and monitoring vendors/services with some very basic recommendations that all generally the same advice delivered in slightly different ways, but curious if there are any caveats or unique things people with real experience would recommend. 
 Appreciate any input.

 Can someone please help me with:
  
If I install Eve-ng Pro without a license, will the installation work with community features enabled without a time limit?
 With a licensed Eve-ng Pro, what happens after 1 year and the pro license expires? Will the installation automatically switch to the community features?
  
Answers to these questions will help me decide if I should start with the pro version. If I start with community, will need to reinstall to the Pro when ready for license purchase. 
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hi, 
 we have multiple used desks that came in with integrated plates and connectors for those plates, those have a different size and locking mechanism than normal female RJ45 keystones. 
 can anyone identify what those are? see pictures

 https://imgur.com/rGnstci (this one isn&#x27;t fully pushed in, it would be flush with the plate and need to insert something through the side holes to unlock it)
 we need to buy a couple of them
 they lock from the sides, from where you put in you patch cable, the plate&#x27;s hole is not standard size, as they are almost square. 
 thanks for any

                              <span>Hey ya&#x27;ll - quick and dumb question. Client has an existing /24 but need to make it a /23.
 existing subnet gateway is 35.1
 when expanding the subnet to a /23 the new subnet begins at 34.0-35.254
 Question of course is, can the gateway stay in place as 35.1 even though it&#x27;s smack dab in the middle of the new subnet? I know it&#x27;s an ugly sight, but technically speaking, will it cause any issues?
 (subnets listed are just examples)

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is a question that comes by this subreddit a lot but I could only find one related post from 9 years ago that was too sophisticated for my level of understanding.
 Please keep in mind I&#x27;m a complete novice to networking and excrutiatingly dumbed down explanations are very much welcomed.
 I see a global unicast address has the value 2000::/3 and I&#x27;m really struggling to understand how the slash notation correlates to the range of addresses it somehow represents.
 I don&#x27;t think it helps because all the explanations I&#x27;m seeing speak of subnetting (which I&#x27;m familiar with in IPv4) but on the other hand I&#x27;ve got a CCNA instructor telling me subnetting doesn&#x27;t exist within IPv6? 
 Help is very much appreciated as this is the first topic I&#x27;ve come across where I&#x27;ve really not been able to find the answer on my own. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 Does anyone know a way to test PPPoE without a line?
 For more context, we have a Palo Alto, a cisco switch which we are configuring for a remote site.
 Compared to our other sites, this one is the only one with a PPPoE line and we&#x27;d like to somehow do a mock with a laptop and the equipment so hopefully and plug and play job for when we send the kit out.
 We plan to have one of our Palo interfaces be the primary port for this line and want to test in advance.

 I face a problem that even sophos didn&#x27;t manage to resolve.
 We have 2 sophos firewall on the same lan. The 1st is used by user to connect with sslvpn. Some of our server have the 2nd firewall has gateway.
 The user who are connected on sslvpn cannot touch the server who have the other firewall has gateway.
 I realize some routing have to be done, but tbh i&#x27;m a bit lost.

                              <span>In my city where I want to host my Parsec connection the fastest internet connection is 50mbps down and 8 mbps up.
 What I have seen from other people using a load balancing router to increase their bandwith is that some connections can&#x27;t split the packages across 2 seperate IPS-to-user lines and others can.
 I was wondering if Parsec does split data when I merge two IPS DSL lines by using a load balancing router to get 100 down and 16 up for the faster upload.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to find an answer to what feels like a very simple question. On a 100GBase-SR4 connection (let&#x27;s say between two switches) if one fibre or one pair fails, what is the behaviour? Is the connection lost or does it simply degrade in performance (eg dropping to 50/25/10Gbps)? I can&#x27;t find an answer to this anywhere.
 I presume any answer would apply equally to LR4 or copper connections.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello there, 
 I&#x27;m right now researching for a Project which I&#x27;m not able to Lab atm. thats why I&#x27;m asking here :).
 ​
 Customer came from a Sophos UTM which did Reverse Proxy and Default Gateway. Now he bought a Fortigate with a FortiWeb (Reverse Proxy / WAF)
 ​
 Now we think about the Network Design.
 I thought about the following:
 DNAT from Fortigate to FortiWeb(WAF) into the DMZ
 Then FortiWeb has Default Route on FortiGate which then routes traffic to the Webservers, which are all on a seperate VLAN. 
 ​
 Routing should work, but I have a feeling that SSL Offloading on the FortiWeb doesn&#x27;t, since Session is being internally route and response comes back from different IP (Webserver). Can anyone confirm or entlighten me ?
 ​
 Thank you very much

                              <span>Disclaimer: this is a homework exercise
 I manage AS33 which has two uplinks to one provider (ISP A) and one uplink to another provider (ISP B). One of the traffic engineering tasks is to route inbound traffic to my prefix in priority via Router A connected to ISP A.
 It is trivial on Router B connected to ISP A by prepending the as-path. But here&#x27;s the tricky bit the ISPs have a peer-to-peer connection thus the local preference is lower than their provider-customer routes to me (reference). The local prefence over my route is 90 to their peer 40. I did prepend the path here just to see if it works.
 As far as I understood weight and local preference are evaluated first and the as-path is not taken into account so how do I overcome this? Is there a way to only advertise my network 33.0.0.0/8 when the link to ISP A fails?
 We are using FRR v7.5

                              <span>I nave a fortigate device that has an IPsec tunnel with multiple phase 2 selectors formed with an FTD(this is a client device that i dont manage) Phase 1 is up, Phase 2 is up. The client can ping every device in the source list defined in phase 2 however i can only hit the most recent device the client ping me from in his range.
 For example if the client pings my PC from .8 i can then ping .8 as much as i want, but if the client then pings me from .7 i can ping .7 but i can no longer ping .8.
 The client has to initiate traffic for phase 2 to come back up if i taken the tunnel down. We&#x27;ve exhausted more than one Fortinet support tech on this, anyone ever encountered this before?

                              <span>I’ve got a new building that we’ve set up with multiple stacks of Cisco 9200L switches. The stacks are all 5 or 6 switches. The stacks all have full ring redundancy. As part of my testing I’ve been running various failure scenarios and in the event the stack master goes offline it is bringing down the entire stack. All ports on the other switches go offline for over a minute. The standby becomes the new master but it seems like the stack election is taking a long time. This should be close to instant shouldn’t it? Is there some configuration I’m missing for this to be faster or is that the expected behaviour?

                              <span>So this is just kinda a curiosity I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen before. I am running ISE PIC version 2.7. I ran a backup using TFTP and watched on my TFTP server as the file loaded in, verified it was there, and then looked back at ISE which had an error stating &quot;Copy to repository Failed&quot;. I&#x27;ll most likely run another backup using FTP instead as the failure has me a bit nervous that the files may be incomplete or corrupt. Has anyone else seen this behavior before? If so did you happen to test these backups? The file sizes match previous backup file sizes and my TFTP server had no errors in it&#x27;s logs to show.

                              <span>I see a lot of early and mid career advice topics on here, but seldom any late stage career advice topics.
 It got me to thinking… traditional network engineering (tcp/ip, routing &amp; switching) as a dedicated career field is not that old. The Internet became increasingly popular in the mid 1990s, and Cisco released the CCNA exam in 1998.
 Let’s say you were part of that first wave of CCNAs, a young professional out of college and got CCNA and your first networking job in 1998 at the tender young age of 21. That means you’ve been working in networking for 24 years now, a true CLI Warrior. You’ve seen some stuff! But… you’re only 45 years old. 
 The average retirement age in the US is between 62-65. You’re nowhere near retiring yet! You’ve still got another 15-20 years left easily… you’ll be …</span>

                              <span>Hello all. I have a network with multiple subnets at many locations. At location B, I have a SonicWALL configured with the network 10.30.19.x, with the SonicWALL serving as the DHCP server. The SonicWALL has a VPN to the datacenter. Clients are connected via Meraki switches and APs in bridged mode. Some clients at location B are receiving 10.30.11.x addresses from the DHCP server at location C, which also has a VPN connection to the data center. Is there a way to block DHCP requests from traversing the VPN? If not, how can I force location B clients to only use the local SonicWALL for DHCP? I appreciate any advice, as I don&#x27;t want to break a production environment if at all possible! Happy Thanksgiving.
 ​
 edit: Devices at location C are also getting IPs from location B

                              <span>I have an older Cisco 3800 series router running 15.1M. It has a periodic problem where it will lose its IP address that is assigned via DHCP, and black hole traffic.
 I want to write an on-box script that will check a tracked object (e.g. ping 8.8.8.8), and if it is down, do the following:
 config t interface Gig0/1 shut no shut 
 Can anyone suggest what is the best way to go about this? Honestly I haven&#x27;t done any automation in quite a while...

                              <span>Hello all! I need help with this configuration/advised with a routing S2S question(s).
 We opened a new branch office and a S2S VPN tunnel is up between both Palo Alto firewall between branch office to HQ office. My question is, the layer 3 Cisco switch at the branch office using static IP addresses, what would be the next hop so that the branch office knows how to communicate with other IP networks at HQ? 
 I can ping the main physical interface 1(native) network 10.8.10.0/24 from the branch office to HQ, but cannot ping another sub-interface networks that live in HQ. 
 So far, this is the current IP static routes on the branch office layer 3 Cisco switch:
 Ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.8.30.1 &lt;- PA eth 1 gateway interfac Ip route 10.8.1.0/24 &lt;- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 Ip route 10.8.0.0/24 &lt;- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 I can ping from the Branch office to HQ subnet 10.8.10.0 which is the network on the physical interface at HQ but I can’t ping other networks as sub-interface. Is this a routing issue?

                              <span>Help. I was trying to check a fiber connection. It’s in a very tight spot so I use a small flathead to tap the fiber connectors latch. All is good the cable came out of the sfp and I pull up the latch and out the sfp. After checking I put fiber into sfp and push the sfp into the switch. But now I can’t pull our the fiber connector anymore let along the sfp. I push the latch in but this time it just seems to be stuck. Anyone known why this happens? 
 Thank you.

                              <span>I put a firewall to replace a Cisco router and it is blocking due to asymmetric routing. I am trying to confirm the path of the traffic so I can understand the issue and fix it. I have used tracert from my pc and it is not showing the default gateway in the hops when going from one subnet to another. I unplugged the GW and it fails to connect so it must be using it. Why is the Cisco not showing in the traceroute? Is there a better way to see the path that the packet is flowing?

 Question in the title, I&#x27;m gonna assume Cisco but honestly there is no real answer where I look.
 I&#x27;m looking to emigrate eventually to Germany for a networking role in the future and just curious.
 How big is juniper in Germany also? is there many companies over there using junos gear?

                              <span>Hi, I have a new router with SFP ports which I want to connect to my old switches that have GBIC ports via fiber channel.
 I searched the internet for articles about how to choose the right transceivers. I know that two transceivers will work together if they have the same wavelength and fiber type (MM or SM). All those articles talked about SFPs. They didn&#x27;t mention their compatibility with GBICs.
 So my question is can SFP work together with GBIC if they share the same specifications (wavelength and fiber type)? Must they be with the same speed or can I buy 10gig SFP and connect it to 1gig GBIC?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I’m not great at networking but I’m doing my best in the environment I inherited with little documentation. We have mostly Brocade switches with a few HP switches, but I want to replace some of them with Unifi switches. The current Vlans are as follows:
 1: Management (I know, I know – this needs to change)
 2: Corporate
 333: Guest 1
 666: Guest 2
 999: Unifi Management
 1000: Default VLAN
 I am working on running fiber home runs but in the meantime, many of these switches are daisy chained. So for example, floor 1 switch would have the router coming into port 1 and port 2 would go to floor 2 switch port 1. Port 2 from this switch would go to floor 3 switch port 1 and so on. These ports all use vlan 1 as their “primary” vlan (in the Brocade config it says “dual-mode 1” for these ports). T…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with creating a hidden SSID for a small group of devices. These devices should ONLY be able to communicate with themselves in their respective subnet, i.e no access to other subnets or WAN. This SSID will need to be implemented in all 8 of our locations and the devices will travel to different locations. 
 We have a 2 tier architecture, so each location&#x27;s distribution layer also handles the routing up to our main office. Our use of VLANS is minimal, we have 3 for VoIP, Data, and Management. Our wireless AP&#x27;s are Ruckus. Our wireless LAN is using the &quot;Management&quot; vlan, or vlan 30 (Interface on SonicWall). This LAN is also what connects our switches to the SonicWall. 
 I&#x27;m trying to think of the best way to implement this, but I worry I may be overthinking it?

                              <span>Need someone&#x27;s brain I need to pick. I have a classic router on a stick. I&#x27;m doing a redesign of core and distribution layer. Would it be best-practice to enable portfast trunk on all interswitch links (core to distribution and distribution to access) to allow for fast reconvergence of my spanning tree? Or is this not recommended? 
 Had an issue today upon enabling a new link on my old core that caused a reconvergence and caused some clusters to lose their connection to their quorum ( thanks SAP); and I want to prevent this in the future.
 EDIT: for anyone finding this post in the future. Portfast trunk should only be enabled on ports linking to ehter a router/firewall or a device containing a virtual switch (Most Hypervisors; eg VMware). For edge devices, use portfast together with bpduguard.

                              <span>Hello,
 Trying to do a post-mortem on a weird situation I had yesterday. It seemed that one of our IPSEC VPN LAN-LAN connections was knocking out 2 -3 of our other LAN-LAN VPNs. Not finding anything in the logs besides &quot;IPsec connection was disconnected passively. &quot; There was some network troubleshooting being done at on of the other sites with a VPN, but theirs was not having any issues it seems.
 Tried all the basic troubleshooting/power cycling, rebuilt the VPN connections on each router. All the sudden towards end of day, started working normally. 
 I&#x27;m a sysadmin/jack of all trades/helpdesk position. Boss has more networking knowledge, but is out all week. My plan is to have the router in question replaced tomorrow, but wondering if anyone has any ideas, or tips how to get to the bottom of what was happening and if I really need to replace this router in question. It&#x27;s been stable for about 18 hours.

                              <span>I&#x27;m supporting a number of mobile users working in locations that have LTE and 5G coverage. We&#x27;re using some consumer-grade tethering hotspots with a stipulation that users connect to the corp VPN when using it. They&#x27;re mostly fine when coupled with EU data-roaming SIMs, but setup is manual and we have no policy control so the system isn&#x27;t scaling well and we can&#x27;t debug issues. 
 What I&#x27;d like is something that&#x27;s still a small, rechargeable device, but that offers enterprise niceties such as:
  
Dual SIM (Not essential, but it can help in some edge cases)
 Management portal with signal and usage metrics and connection logs.
 Simple L3 controls. (At least so I can force users to connect to our full-tunnel VPN)
  
If you&#x27;re familiar with the Cradlepoint ecosystem, then basically this, but with a smaller, battery-powered chassis.

 WCCP Sees the Proxy&#x27;s and reports usable but seemingly 40-60% of Websites that should be blocked gets blocked

 Is it good idea to put all DB servers in one VLAN, A by All App server in other VLAN ? In this case, if a function has one DB server and VLAN is assigned with /24 then its a waste of addresses.
 or
 Do you separate each DB and App servers by function?
 Appreciate any suggestions

                              <span>Hi r/networking
 Looking for some feedback on something. We have had a dev come to us - asking for access to pcap driver for sniffing traffic to locate certain devices.
 My initial reaction to this was a hard no - as I was always taught this was a very bad thing to do. With the risk of intercepting unencrypted data such as passwords etc.
 In today&#x27;s world - would you consider this as much of a risk? My personal thoughts are:
  
L2 boundaries (such as VLAN with SVI) will limit what can be easily sniffed.
 plaintext data is a risk no matter what (should be wrapped or encryption).
 purely talking about sniffing of packets, not any other related attacks, the risks are minimal if everything is encrypted?
  
edit: I should mention my recommendation was for scanning the ip-ranges instead (as this would also allow for situations where devices are in another l3 network). You could pre-populate with the ip range of the adapter used for the scan.

                              <span>If anyone has used Kemp loadmaster in Azure? Will it load balance to any backend members (with whatever they can SNAT) or only stuff in the same vnet? I’ve worked on F5s but their cloud VMs are stupid expensive. Looking to make the change.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 We have some application that require user to be admin for it to run. We cannot not use those software, so don&#x27;t tell me about using alternative please.
 Does anyone else have these type of constraint and how do you go around it without making the user admin?
 Right now, we are using encrypted PowerShell script to launch runas an admin user on that computer. But I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s better way to do it then this way?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Apologies if this is kind of a noob question but I&#x27;m wanting to setup a way to automate as much of the process as I can for new Windows 10 installs on desktops for end users. I&#x27;m wanting to achieve the below:
  
Run Windows 10 setup (unattended)
 
Boot into Windows and run Windows Updates, download drivers (Detect if GPU Intel/NVIDIA/AMD and download most up-to-date driver), run DISM/SFC/CHKDSK/Defender and reboot
 
Run updates again then reboot (at least x2)
 
Run Prime95 for 15 mins and write results to log file
 
Run memtest
 
Update BIOS
 
 ​
 Would a PXE server be the best way to go about the Windows 10 install itself, and can this be configured to run in unattended mode? I&#x27;ve created a batch file which will run DISM, SFC scan, schedule a CHKDSK for the next reboot, run a Windows Defender quick scan, run Windows updates and schedule a reboot for 30 minutes but I&#x27;m assuming there are better ways of doing this, especially since I&#x27;d need to manually copy this file across once the initial install has been completed and execute it manually. Any advice is appreciated!

                              <span>I have been having a weird situation that has me stumped. Our organization implemented the Microsoft PAM solution (from mim 2016) with a management forest (all on-premise). we have several scripts that have stopped working recently that execute within the management forest the Corp forest trusts the management forest but it is a one way trust. the issue is when I try to authenticate to the corp forest with corp\username authentication fails, but if i use corp.consanto.com\username it succeeds. I have messed with lmhosts etc. to try to fix this and have had no luck. there is a lot of scripts using similar authentications and I really don&#x27;t want to update everything, would rather figure out why it suddenly stopped working after years of working fine. has anyone ran into this or something similar with the recent security hardening? 
 ​
 example script:
 $user &#x3D; get-credentials #corp\username and password
 $pg &#x3D; New-PamGroup - SourceGroupName Testgroup - SourceDomain CORP.Consanto.com -SourceDC CORPDC - Credentials $user

                              <span>Curious what’s everyone’s go to for PC vendor currently. I’ve ordered from the big three (Lenovo, HP, Dell) but wanting to try to potentially stick with one. I’m leaning slightly towards Dell at this point (although I’ve really liked the X1 Carbons from Lenovo), but I’m open to suggestions.

                              <span>Time and time again these vendors reach out offering their side-by-side comparison against x Solution and why they&#x27;re better, and time and time again the writing vendor has ALL of these checkmarks and their competition has none. Can we all agree to push back on these vendors to actually do an effective job of selling instead of providing Markitecture? I&#x27;ve seen it especially across the security landscape from all sides and it&#x27;s a huge turnoff.

                              <span>I just had to deal with a pretty serious P1 emergency where literally lives could have been at stake, I can&#x27;t share details but police were involved type of thing, and I had zero discomfort about it due to my experience leading fleets in the MMO Eve Online AKA &quot;Excel with nice graphics&quot;. I&#x27;m just comfortable with having to rapidly gather, digest, communicate, and prioritize significant amounts of information to/from multiple people explicitly because in Eve, I would have 60-300 people in a group with me needing similar communications for our internet space battles to go well. The group I was part of even had us do after action reports (AAR), and I swear its 1:1 what I have to do at my job. IDK how I would have been able to build this skillset in &quot;the real world&quot; with a similar level of non-consequence for failure. 
 If you are considering going into IT leadership/management, or just like terribly complicated grindy spaceship games full of massive try hard garbage, you should totally give leading fleets in Eve Online a try :P

 Are these internal only, or in some weird repository that isn&#x27;t easy to find? Otherwise I think I&#x27;m the first to post these online...

                              <span>So, as the title reads, in an update from a while back I updated to some stable build (I don&#x27;t remember which one) of Windows 11. I then noticed that my task scheduler script wasn&#x27;t working, I checked whether everything was set up correctly, but then I looked at the Event Viewer, and EventID 4688 for process creation events was nowhere to be found. I then went through the documentation which (at the time) didn&#x27;t say anything about Windows 11 and then contacted Microsoft, got elevated, and the support told me the feature was no longer supported.
 Now, luckily I only use this event for triggering a launch script, which is relatively easy to do manually through a shortcut, but this is still pretty annoying.
 Other sysadmins use this event for more important stuff, like monitoring the usage of their devices for many different types of purposes.If you want to vote on this feature to return, upvote this post in the Feedback Hub.
 Edit: The story gets, weirder, a recent insider build said it fixed this issue, while support and the technical writers have said that the feature isn&#x27;t supported. Something really strange must be happening in Redmond...

                              <span>So. I’ve managed to entrench myself at a small media company as their “tech support/IT/networking/anything nerdy” guy. Problem is a severe lack of understanding and appreciation about the entire field of IT and system support and I’m getting pretty “over it”. It’s a cobbled together network with no servers so nothing more than a UniFi router and switches and some APs, and most of my time is spent just doing tier 1 help desk crap and attempting to make some sort of sense of data management for a video production company that uses 30-60tb a quarter and wants all of it accessible at any time and doesn’t want to delete anything and also doesn’t understand why a production RAID isn’t a backup. 
 I’ve digressed a bit because my ACTUAL question is: even as a very quick learner and problem solver, am I just dead in the water being so out of the loop on industry standard systems and practices? Once upon a time I was a student admin for the defense department in the late 90’s early 00’s so I’m very in the loop in a general way and have plenty of hoop-jumping experience having worked for DOD and dealt with about every major red tape hurdle you could think of for IT and dev teams given the GsA phonebooks of rules and restrictions, BUT I just get dejected looking at current posting when they list about 5-10 different things I’ve never dealt with in my life because there hasnt been a need in my current career path. So I guess what I’m asking is, am I just super behind and if so, is there a resource anyone could recommend for “learning what it is I need to learn about” if that makes sense? I am fully capable of learning a new skill or system very rapidly but I just don’t know where to begin after being left “unsupervised” for this long. Thanks all and be gentle, I’m an old nerd stepping out of a cave for the first time in a decade.

                              <span>The AD environment in my org is a dumpster fire. Actually, it&#x27;s a cluster fuck, wrapped in a shit storm, residing in a dumpster fire. One problem I am dealing with right now is they are trying to populate the department attribute with both tier 1 and tier 2 departments. Think of it like department and team. Problem is, they are constantly exceeding the 64 character limit since hospital department and team names tend to be a bit verbose. I have tried copious abbreviations but then it looks like code that no one has the deciphering key to. Anyone else who has run into this, how to do manage this? I was thinking of using two separate attributes but if I use something like any of the extensionattributes, obvious these would not be very easily seen by end users. Suggestions?

                              <span>Hey all, I have a weird one that i cannot figure out. We have both internal AD and azure AD with all of our laptops hybrid joined to azure. 
 Our current onprem password policy is 12 characters plus whatever else. We have noticed that hybrid joined devices seem to ignore that and instead use the Azure policy of 8 characters. There is now way to change the 8 character limit in Azure, so how do we force these devices to follow the onprem policy? 
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t tend to deal with many Macs and when i do it feels like a foreign language. So hoping someone hear can assist a bit? 
 I have a Macbook in Apple Business Manager (that synced to Jamf Now). I reset the macbook and turned it off then released it from Apple Business Mnager &amp; Jamf Now. However a few days later trying to start it up and go through new setup its still connected to my organisation, click continue and it just says failed to get MDM.
 So 2 questions:
 1) Did I release it correctly, I think I did (similar process to Intune devices.
 2) How can I reset it from this state?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Earlier today the DC that is running my fsmo roles had an issue opening its dns zone information and was listing event 4007 errors. I follows the instructions listed here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/dns-zones-do-not-load-event-4000-4007
 and since this DC with the issue was the PDC I reset using itself as the target and that worked. server rebooted and i can open my dns again. However now i&#x27;m noticing the other DC&#x27;s listing &quot;:error&quot; when looking at operations master in AD, and i can see this error on my PDC role DC that had the dns issue. 
 &quot;Unable to verify the convergence of this machine account. does the machine account need resetting?&quot; I see other people have used netdom to fix this, but i just did reset the machine password as per the Microsoft article so i&#x27;m confused if i need to reset it again, and if so with what syntax? or do i need to rest the other DC&#x27;s? 
 Hopefully someone can explain this a bit better to me. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins, I&#x27;m having a tough time figuring this one out, or I may just be running in circles. Does Remote Desktop Gateway only support NTLM authentication or is there a way to get it to use Kerberos? No matter what I&#x27;ve tried it always authenticates with NTLM to the Gateway, whether I am on premise or at home using KDCProxy. I&#x27;ve scoured every post on the net I can find but there&#x27;s no straight answer on this. I&#x27;ve tried the flags rdgiskdcproxy:i:1 (my KDCProxy is my Gateway) and that didn&#x27;t work. I am running NLA but I don&#x27;t want to turn that off as that offers protection. I&#x27;m aware that NTLM is the protocol that will never die at this point, but if there is a way to implement Kerberos I would love some assistance. Thank you all very much in advance for any help or advice you might have. Gateway is running Windows Server 2022 Datacenter.

                              <span>I&#x27;m so tired of lazy developers not catching exceptions and including relevant information in logs. server unavailable? what freaking server is unavailable ?! its a microservice architecture, there are lots of them. When I complain, I usually get the reply: &quot;just make sure everything is working perfectly in the environment, and my code will work fine&quot; . Just because your code thinks a &quot;server&quot; is unavailable doesnt mean it actually is. Got one right now. on a server restart it complains that the authentication server is unavailable. Im assuming it means the mssql server that it uses(which is up), and ill base my troubleshooting on that, but i could be wrong. PMs this is why troubleshooting custom applications takes so long!

 The ProcessID matches my VMWare Tools, and my FusionInventory Services. Do you have any ideas on how to resolve these errors ? Thanks !

                              <span>We don&#x27;t use any thrid-party printing solutions, just plain old print server. Printers are deployed through good-old GPO through print server
 As far as for anyone else, after all the print nightmare fiasco and new server patches - printers stopped mapping for new PCs or if different print driver is in use. GPO result reports errors and you can only install manually by providing admin creds. (all known stuff)
 I&#x27;ve decided that&#x27;s fine, I will just do it manually when needed -- whatever. Maybe MS will fix this. Nope. I think it&#x27;s time to do something else.
 I know that some sysadmins are deploying printers locally to computers by using IP addresses. I&#x27;m unfortunately not very fond of this idea as you lose centralized spooler for that printer. Also way less painful if there is network change…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m quite new to networking and using servers in general and I&#x27;m experiencing a weird issue that&#x27;s only just started to occur that I can&#x27;t really find a solution for with google.
 I have a home media server connected to my network running Xubuntu with a static IP address (192.168.0.69) that I use at home to connect to for storing data, listening to music, programming and occasionally other things.
 Recently, I&#x27;ve been waking up to find that I can no longer connect to this device via my network.
 If I ping 192.168.0.69 from any device I own I recieve the following response:
 Pinging 192.168.0.69 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. 
 This problem, however, can immediately be resolved by going downstairs into the room where my router and server co-exist, and simply pressing the power button on said server, waiting until it switches off, then pressing the power button again.
 As soon as I do that, everything returns to normal and everything is up and connected for about 2-3 days until I inevitably wake up the next morning to find everything disconnected again.
 This has only just started to happen, it&#x27;s been fine up until now.
 Any help is appreciated :)
 Edit: over-use of the word &#x27;again&#x27; removed.

 Anyone else seeing their PRTG cloud sensors having a bit of a wobble today? We keep getting alerts that a site is down or very slow responses from the site.
 It&#x27;s been moaning about 4 or 5 sites/services which are hosted in multiple different locations
 Oh and it&#x27;s intermittent

 ​
 How do i get it to show me last modified times on subfolders form top lever, i tired the search ribbon and last modified from a week but its giving me sub folder within sub folder, must be a way i can do it

 Lansweeper is the OG everyone knows. How is RunZero or Domotz better than Lansweeper?

                              <span>Let me start this by saying this whole situation is utter hell, but it&#x27;s a necessity.
 I have a server that came from a company we acquired. On this server, let&#x27;s call it HV1, we have a HyperV installation with 2 DC&#x27;s, an APP/RDS Server and a DB server (MS Access), and all of these servers are on Server 2012 R2. This host is sitting cold on the network and will never touch the wider internet. On the APP/RDS server is a proprietary software that was developed by the former company over the course of 15 years and there&#x27;s no documentation. It talks to MS Access files on the DB server and there is a mapped drive to these files on the APP/RDS server. The software is loaded from the APP/RDS server and seems to be very tied into the domain with domain authentication and will not boot unless one of the two DCs is powered on. If the DCs are off, I get some SQL network errors saying the system cannot contact a DC to service the auth request. Boot them on, the software loads and asks for credentials.
 I now need to repurpose this G9 server and use it for production, which means I need to migrate this setup away from this host and onto an older server which can continue sitting cold for X time. Essentially, replicating the entire setup from one server to another, and the only difference being that I&#x27;ll be moving it to VMware instead of using HyperV. Instant concern when I was asked for this was the domain controllers.
 I&#x27;ve done the initial backup &amp; restore using Veeam, and I now have all of the servers sat on my new host. The problem of course is the domain and DCs - They aren&#x27;t functional/working and that domain essentially is non-existent at the moment.
 Before I go any further, I want to have a think about the potential best ways to bring these DCs back to life, purely for the purpose of getting this application working again.
 Thoughts?
 Cheers!

                              <span>Unfortunately we&#x27;re still very much learning how to use Endpoint Management with Azure, as the main business is still on prem. However, the &quot;side business&quot; uses exclusively Azure
 We don&#x27;t have auto enrolment available to use, and are relying on users logging in on the new laptop. The problem then is that the user becomes local admin, which is bad. The solution to this has been to create an entry in user account protection that sets the only admins as &quot;administrator&quot; (local admin) and a special pcadmin account we created on Azure AD. To my understanding, this is fine
 The issue we have though, is if we need to support a user remotely, we can&#x27;t elevate privileges in Bomgar (BeyondTrust) using the Azure account, it only seems to support local user accounts. This hasn&#x27;t been a problem as we were with the users logging into their laptops, so we could set the admin password at the machine, but the case has arisen where I need to do something on a laptop which was bought and remains in another country
 I was hoping I could, as a temporary workaround, add a PS script to enable and set the local admin password, but either it&#x27;s not working or the laptop just won&#x27;t sync, because it&#x27;s not made a difference
 Is there a solution to my problem, or do I need to take a few steps back and make some bigger changes to our system (other than auto-enrolment)
 ​
 Bonus question - my employer will pay for training courses. Is there a recommended one I can go on for Enpoint Manager/Intune? I&#x27;ve seen the Azure course, but I fear that doesn&#x27;t really cover the device management I need to learn

Who else still offers this without plans to disable it? We aren&#x27;t using exactly phpMailer, but something similar (not sure right now)
 I just want to avoid our software guys having to rework half of the app, as well as learning with MS Graph (where does one even start).

 We&#x27;ve introduced a new ERP back in August. We&#x27;ve got Vmware Horizon VDIs (4 cores, 8GB RAM, Win Server 2016) and the employees use MS Edge to access the ERP. Everything worked great until now, now some of them are having major performance issues when scrolling/clicking through the webclient. It doesn&#x27;t crash, but the entire browser becomes unresponsive for 8-10 seconds. Same result with Chrome and Firefox. The majority has Teams, Outlook, a few Excel sheets, a few Chrome tabs and MS Edge open, which uses around 30% CPU and 60% RAM altogether.
 I tested it on the local thinclient browser and it runs fine there, so the problem only seems to persists on the VDIs.

                              <span>Just started at a new job which is heavily involved in hosting - physical (about 30 ish) &amp; virtual servers (from 2-8 per physical), domain names &amp; certificates, vlans &amp; routing, BGP, load balancing, etc.
 Now, I was expecting at least some sort of minimal central management, but sadly no. It&#x27;s just spreadsheets, as far as the eye can see, each &quot;designed&quot; by someone different and with varying levels of techno-fluff.
 So, my first job is to sort those spreadsheets into something manageable. I&#x27;ve no experience managing this much equipment and objects, so no idea where to start - my background is developer/opportunistic devops/dogs body, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s particularly daunting for me.
 For what it&#x27;s worth, Zabbix is installed and actually appears to up to date and useful, so it&#x27;s not so much monitoring that I&#x27;m looking for as it is management.

                              <span>Hello,
 Printer/copier/fax: Canon imageRUNNER 1730i
 Is there a way, for documents that are forwarded from the fax machine, to show sender info in the body of the email?
 ​
 Curently fax&#x27;s are fowarded from [copier@ourcompany.com](mailto:copier@ourcompany.com) and sent to all staff emails. These emails have a basic subject line which I can edit &quot;our company ltd&quot; and have an attached pdf of what was sent through. The naming of the pdf is randomly generated and no sender info is available in the body of the email.
 Currently faxs are not printed, only forwarder to all of the team.
 It is very difficult to find older fax emails as there is no way to search by specific sender email or phone. (I think they are all coming in via fax # but have no way to confirm.
 I feel there is a check box somewhere in admin settings I am missing or not understanding that could apply sender info to fwd&#x27;d email somehow.
 Any help appreciated!
 Cheers,
 Cheap

 Problem:
 After the last &quot;Security Update for Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Update 23 (KB5019758)&quot; we noticed several Problems in our environment. User pretty much immediately reportet that the Outlook Search was not working. This is not a new occurance and the workaround is that they click the blue text beneath the error saying something like &quot;Search on local Coputer instead&quot; which works for users that run with Exchange Cache mode. Since barely anyone is using it and we didn&#x27;t have any needs for it eighther we only not…</span>

                              <span>Can anyone suggest why an MSI unattended installation (using msiexec /i) would work when the installer files are copied locally, but not when they&#x27;re on a network drive?
  
The installer uses files external to the MSI.
 The MSI contains a copy of 7z.exe which it extracts to a folder under %TEMP% and uses to extract the external files (they are .wxi.7z files in an Installer.Components folder).
 I&#x27;ve already tried setting the FilterAdministratorToken registry setting in case it was to do with that, but that had no effect.
 The MSI was made using the WIX installer toolset.
 I tried doing caspol.exe -q -machine -addgroup 1 -url file://Z:/* FullTrust -name &quot;Z Drive&quot; as WIX is apparently a .NET application and may need extra permissions to be able to access network drives, but this did not fix the issue.
 I tried doing a Process Monitor capture to see if I could identify what was wrong, but nothing popped out at me.
 The installer log file contains the errors &quot;Error. Failed to attach console to process. Error Code: 5. Error. 7z.exe returned exit code: 0&quot;
  
Because the install files are large (total is around 24GB), I don&#x27;t want to have to copy them locally onto machines I need to deploy this app on.

Checked iPhone notifications are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator app. They are.

 When I go through GUI to user separately I can see the line, when their password was changed.
 When I use an API command 
 list-users --domain example.lt --multiline 
 I get a lot of information of each user, but nothing about the time, when the password was changed last time.
 How could I get that info?

                              <span>Hi All,
 My colleague who does not work on this project anymore, created the CA infra on my domain. For some testing purposes he created multiple certs for both the root and the intermediate servers. 
 I would like to sanitize this config, so only the current and valid cert is visible. 
 On Certificate Authority app I right click the server at the top of the tree, Properties, and on the General tab there are 2 CA certificates for my intermediate server. I revoked (from the root) the one which I don&#x27;t need, published the CRL, deleted this cert (backed up previously) from the intermediate server itself (cert store), but on this list it is still visible.
 Is there a way to delete from this list? Or is that enough what I have done?
 Thank you!

 I was looking for some service/portal that can let me know when specific application that we use from various distributors get new releases. I can&#x27;t find anything interesting. So, for example if new LibreOffice or Chrome or GIMP has a new version released, we can have it in one place, rather then checking on my own for each app.
 If anyone has an idea or is using something similar, please let me know.
 Regards
 Wolf

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a migration of a server containing all the backup copies of our VMs via a hardware RAID, and I am looking for information on the feasibility of the trick.
 Currently I have an HP DLXXX G8 with 12 SATA LFF, and I have a DLXXX G9, with the correct slots, and a P840 which is fine.
 My seller more or less told me this: &quot;Normally, you move the disks, and the RAID is automatically recognized, and it starts again&quot;, I find it hard to believe that it will go so well, however, I do not have the technical possibility of moving all the content to another storage (no space available, no financial means to buy 12 LFF of 8 TB , we are a very small company). 
 Have you ever had the experience, it goes well in general? Thanks in advance :D

                              <span>Hello,
 I have very strange problem with doveco on VPS with debian 10
 Local mail from user to user are placed in Junk folder
 If i restart dovecot then mails start to go to Inbox. After 10-15 minutes again start to move to Junk
 Local user is whitelisted, message is not detected as spam
 In both cases email is delivered to maildir
 , relay&#x3D;virtual, delay&#x3D;0.08, delays&#x3D;0.05/0.01/0/0.01, dsn&#x3D;2.0.0, status&#x3D;sent (delivered to maildir)
 I have turned postfix debug on and there is no info, Turned dovecot lda debug but there is nothing inside.
 ​
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi r/networking,
 I’d love to get some advice from the community and get some pointers on where I can take my career. I’ve worked at a MSP for about 2 years and for the last 5 years I’ve worked for school district where I’m the lone systems and network administrator. I’m fully in charge of maintaining and upgrading about 100 switches and 400 access points, mix of Meraki and Cisco across 11 sites. About 5000 users in total. For the network end I’ve implemented and swapped out access layer switches, implemented a basic single area OSPF, setup vlans/port security/BYOD network/etc., maintain a wireless network and troubleshoot various problems that come up. 
 As for the systems side of it. I’m also in charge of managing and upgrading servers. I’ve done multiple domain controller upgrades, file server migrations, NPS servers, DHCP, Print, Hyper-V upgrades/deployments, Image creation from Windows 7 to Windows 11. 
 I’ve also been point person on several projects, some with outside vendor and some internal. 
 My question to the community is, I feel I have a very good picture of IT from a big picture but I would love to become a more advanced network engineer and climb up the salary rank. Where can I take my next step to really speed up the learning process? I’ve done MSP work before but feel they always get bogged down with lower tier busy work and are very cookie cutter from my experience. 
 I’ve got my degree and in the midst of attaining my CCNP. Any advice? Any recommended industries?

                              <span>I got my CCNA and I&#x27;m studying for my CCNP but yet I feel like I have no idea what real life networks look like outside of very broad architectures(eg 3 tiered) or small LANs. I feel confident configuring a network but if someone sat me down and asked me to design a network for a college or enterprise business I&#x27;d have no idea where to start.
 Besides getting a networking job(soon, fingers crossed) are there any good resources where I can learn about network designs at a high level? Not so much ones concerned with the minutia of network configurations.

                              <span>I have a bit of a weird issue with a new deployment of a 9800 controller and capwap AP&#x27;s. I had seen the occasional iPhone have an IP DHCP learning failure and not really causing huge concerns nobody was really yelling about it but was getting a little concerned as we move close to doing a mass deployment of a major building. It turns out from looking through some forums and then my own config I hadn&#x27;t actually had the DHCP helper addresses on the SVI in question on the controller.
 Here&#x27;s my problem, I don&#x27;t know how any of the devices were getting thcp if there was no relay address configured. The only thing I can think is in the WLAN config I did have the IP of the DHCP server entered, but that&#x27;s different than the helper address. So I&#x27;m a bit stumped as to why it ever worked, also why iOS seems to be the only operating system that felt any impact.

                              <span>hello all,
 ​
 At my current employer, the engineer before me configured each switch weird. On the switches; the first 24 ports are for the Data Vlan and the next 24 ports are for the Voice Vlan. The issue is computers and IP phones are connected to random ports - which then makes a lot of computers and IP phones on the wrong vlan.
 ​
 What is an easy way of cleaning this up? Only way I can think of is going to each port and assigning the correct vlan. Is this the correct way to do it?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I am looking to crowdsource some generic recommendations on wifi in hyperdense environments e.g. metro London, metro SF, metro Toronto, metro NY. I know about spectrum coordination, paying attention to antenna emission patterns and orientations, etc, tuning power appropriately, but are there some more interesting techniques such as RF absorbent paint, low emissivity films, etc to deal with those tough environments? What have you done that&#x27;s worked in very dense metro with a lot of radios, a lot of clients and a lot of interference? Is any one manufacturer in these days of commodity ICs hugely better than others at dealing with &quot;highly contested&quot; RF? Any videos or training that really get down deep?

                              <span>Hey there,
 One of our sites is having an issue where external calls are occasionally getting static. It doesn&#x27;t happen every time nor with every phone, but they get it consistently enough that it seems to be on our end. Looking at some of the calls they have reported on in Mitel Connect Director, there seems to be a correlation of either a high MOL, high delay, or both with these calls, but I&#x27;m not sure how to troubleshoot this further, mainly because the site uses our organizations main PRIs and no one else has reported any issues with static. We had some issues with one of our PRI recently that were resolved, and I was hoping that might also resolve this, but the problem has persisted now for over a month. 
 Is packet capturing the way to go? Are there any other methods to troubleshooting I should try or common causes for poor delay or MOL? Jitter has notably been perfectly fine across all the troublesome calls.

I went to the ASR 9010 and did “no username Cisco” and “no username root” ,then created both users again and changed password using “secret xxxxx” .So while recreating the users ,I didn’t assign them to respective groups/task groups.So right now on one ASR 9010-I can access it but I can pretty much not do anything on the router ,Not even see running config because the users I created have no privileges and I can’t enter “admin conf” mode to give privileges to a user .
 Is there any way I can fix this screw up ? Any links or suggestions welcome .
 I didn’t screw up the other ASR 9010s,I just went to each user and changed password instead of deleting and recreating a user to give them a password .
 P.s we don’t have Cisco tac access anymore because we are about to handover the devices .Some political bull shit

                              <span>IT guy here trying to figure out a better way to organize SFP/SFP+ Transceivers and DAC cables.
 Some recent projects have us with some spare (and old) equipment that is probably worth keeping for at least a little while. Our current organization system has them in a anti-static bag at the bottom of a drawer. 
 Anyone have a good suggestion for a cost effective way to organize transceivers and DAC cables? 
 For fiber patch cables we use handing folders in a portable file tote. One folder per cable length works fairly well for what we normally have on-hand. Cables have a little bit of protection, it is easy to grab and take with you and you can very quickly find the length you are looking for.

                              <span>Newbie here. Why would changing the native VLAN to a VLAN other than VLAN 1 make a switch more secure? I am no hacker but anyone with access to that switch could easily use show commands to see that info right?

                              <span>Hello Redditors,
 I am currently facing a business requirement that is outlined in the image below:
 https://imgur.com/a/gZ76JIm
 This is a hard-set requirement from management.
 My current idea is to use L3VPN and play around with RT-Import/Export to achieve this (I am open to different suggestions as well). 
 However, I have faced the following problems so far:
  
I have to achieve this with IPv6 as well, it seems some of our equipment doesn&#x27;t support 6VPE, my question is, would there be any other way to accomplish this for IPv6 in this case? 
 Looks like I can&#x27;t have different VRFs for IPv4 and IPv6 in the same interface nor can have IPv6 in the main routing table while the interface is part of a VRF
 
 We have an anti-DDoS system that injects routes via BGP to modify the communities for the attacked /24s, currently, this doesn&#x27;t modify the next-hop (we keep the next-hop intact) we just modify the community in order to tell the edge routers &quot;stop all broadcasts to all transits but the scrubbing capable ones&quot;. However, being that this is going to use AF VPNv4 and VPNv6 I don&#x27;t see how I can just keep the next-hop unaltered nor how I could set this up. 
 I can&#x27;t just tell the network &quot;the next-hop is the loopback of core/dist-1&quot; like we currently do, since now the network is inside of a VRF
 Just to clarify, the anti-DDoS injects a route with a higher LPREF than the ones advertised by the core/dist switches at this moment, this causes the edge routers to prefer that one and apply policies based on the communities present on that specific one 
 
 I have also concerns about scalability, we currently have ASR1004/1006 with RP2@16GB and receive full routing tables from prov-2 and prov-1, IXP routes from prov-3 and around 50k routes from prov-4 (and this is only IPv4)
  
Our equipment is a mix of Huawei CE68XX and Cisco ASR1004/1006. 
 Any ideas, hints, or guidelines, especially if you have solved an issue like this before would be really appreciated.
 Regards,

                              <span>Planning to upgrade a FortiManager (6.0.8) with multiple adoms to 6.4.9.
 One adom is in 5.4 version, with fortigates (6.0.9). According to one engineer they had some issues when performing upgrade, so want to delete the specific 5.4 adom before upgrading, and add back the Fortigates after upgrade.
 I&#x27;m not very familiar with FMG, but was thinking about creating a new 6.0 adom and moving the devices there (or even the root adom) instead of deleting. Would that work? Also, what happens to the policy packages? Will they be moved along or do we have to move manually? Would moving policies from 5.4 adom to 6.0 adom screw with the objects?

                              <span>Got a weird one. Currently can&#x27;t ssh from one side of the network into a brocade switch. Core switch has vlan 100 on an svi and doesn&#x27;t tag the downstream switch. Downstream also has vlan 100 and an svi on a different subnet. If I&#x27;m on the Downstream switches network ssh is good across all devices. All svi&#x27;s are pingable anywhere though. I can&#x27;t change the Downstream switches physical ip&#x27;s because of the amount of devices assigned. If I migrate the Downstream switches vlans from 100 to the root ip assignment I think on vlan 1 I think I will fix the issue. Any suggestions?

 I am looking for a complete/database of all the possible event logs windows can generate. I have tried looking online but it seems their inst a complete list mostly community driven post and resources.
 Some of the one i found useful:

 However, i was hoping if their something better out their!!

 I&#x27;ve got memtest, sure fine, but I&#x27;d love a tool which just thrashes the whole machine, bloody thoroughly.
 We have a lot of staff turnover, so machines go from old user to new user, often.
 We have a fleet of identical hardware with identical SOE yet the odd machine will die on users, apparently. I&#x27;d really like to thoroughly test the machines before handing to staff.
 I can run memtest, I can run prime95 but is there anything bootable? Even some kind of intense linux benchmarking suite would be fine? I just want to &#x27;fire and forget&#x27; - come back to a machine 8 hours later and see if it passed or not.
 Anyone got something even close to this?

                              <span>For our staff at my company we use only abundance this means when I am maintaining the images we give to our staff I am keeping a fat image of the whole operating system and then writing it to the drive of there machine
 It would be real nice to store it on our coffee repository rather than a 60gb image.
 This can be annoying at times and it would be much more efficient to store a cloud-init/dockerfile/packer style that I could run and it would build the os for me.
 Is this possible?
 How can I do this?

                              <span>Has anyone actually issued new or updated certificates regarding the whole May 2022 CU debacle breaking NPS authentication? We simply used the Schannel registry method to disable strong mapping, but we&#x27;d like to fix the issue properly. The doc below from Microsoft leaves a lot to be desired in terms of what to do with AD CS and existing cert templates. 
 It sounds like using an additional field in the Alternative Subject Name might do the trick, but should I enable that on the existing certificate template and wait for clients to auto renew, or issue a new one? Issuing a new one seems wise so it can be dished out in stages for testing, but it&#x27;s unclear if the correct cert will be chosen if two exist in the user&#x27;s personal store. 
 Do we also need to issue new certs for the actual NPS server? 
 https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16#bkmk_additionalresources
 Appreciate any insight.

                              <span>I just started a new job and am doing the usual process of learning the environment, meeting with various groups, meeting my team, etc. One thing that stood during some review of the types of Desktops/Laptops/Mobile Devices we support was that rather than the IT department &quot;owning&quot; these assets, the end user&#x27;s department does. 
 In my short time here, we&#x27;ve received several types of tickets asking for &quot;the PC sitting over in Karen&#x27;s old desk area&quot; to be reimaged or &quot;Frank left the company a few months ago, I have his laptop in my lower desk drawer. Can someone go grab it and image it up ASAP? His replacement starts Monday and he&#x27;s going out to a customer site Monday afternoon.&quot;
 I mentioned to my boss this seems out of the ordinary and he insisted it&#x27;s always been this way and he&#x27;d rather have the end user&#x27;s departments responsible for managing their inventory than it falling onto us. Consequently, there are HPs, Dells, Lenovo, Microsoft and Asus desktop &amp; laptops out there due to departments making the decision on what they want to purchase.
 Is there anyone else out there in a similar situation? If so, how do you make it work? My gut reaction is to push for this to be changed, but I&#x27;m so new and not sure if I want to rock the boat quite yet.

                              <span>Is Microsoft support just non-existent? Did all of the real talent holding things together just leave?
 Years ago, i would open a support request, get a response in 6-24 hours, work with a 1st tier support, get escalated once or twice, then work with someone that really knew the product, or watch as the person i was working with gave KVM control to some mythical support tier person that would identify an issue and return a fix. It could be AD, Exchange, windows server, etc. It was slow, but as long as your persisted, you would eventually get to someone that could fix your issue.
 In the last few years though, something has changed. I get passed between queues. I get told to make changes that take services offline. Simple things like &quot;the cloud shell button works everywhere but in the exchange admin web console&quot; gets passed around until i get an obviously thoughtless response of i ...&quot;need to have a subscription to Exchange to use the cloud shell.&quot;
 This extended beyond cloud services. I&#x27;ve had a number of tickets for other microsoft products that get no where. I&#x27;ve received calls from support personnel angry that i would agree to close a ticket that has not been fixed. I get someone calling me at 4am to work on a low-priority issue that ive&#x27; requested email communication.

                              <span>What are your recommendations or personal practices for old PST files on a file server share? The end goal is to remove the local file server that these are on. These PST files were exported when an employee departed from the company before everything was moved to 365. Some may be ancient and can be deleted. Then that leaves what to do with the other 50 PST&#x27;s from former employees that are sitting there not being accessed?
 Option A: Move to Sharepoint with the rest of File Server Contents. 
 Option B: Move to shared 365 mailboxes.
 Option C: What PST&#x27;s? I never seen them. 
 Option D: Portable Hard Drive :/
 Update: From the responses it seems clear the best path is B which I was already leaning heavily towards.

                              <span>I think this is a story many of you here can relate to...
 My ex-boss hired me in January of this year. He&#x27;d kept the IT dept running on a small budget while putting in the overtime and working weird hours to patch things outside of business time. He made no bones about being overworked but it was obvious he wasn&#x27;t going anywhere since he&#x27;d been there for so long (at least, that&#x27;s what I had assumed given his long tenure with the company - 15+ years).
 Requests for a larger budget to replace equipment and grow the IT department were universally rejected. There has only been one exception recently which was the addition of my position to the IT team. Apparently this is something my boss had been pushing for years since the company is doing really well and expanding across the board. 
 8 or 9 weeks ago some shit hit the fan, one of the higher ups spoke to my overworked boss in a way that definitely was not well received. All of this revolved around a situation that I&#x27;m sure could have been avoided with properly scaling IT to the company&#x27;s growth. My boss put in his 2 week notice on the spot.
 Fast forward to today - servers are down and multiple services and network storage drives are inaccessible. There are 3 of us at the help desk with no clue how to fix it. There are plenty applicants and interviews to fill the position but I can only assume the salary offers are too low since none of the people who come through are ever heard from again.
 A large part of the company is dead in the water today. Good times.

 idk, I have to research and test all the individual items, then validate them across platforms.
 Great, how long will that take?
 i.d.k; some items might take 10 minutes, others might take 3 hours to figure out. It&#x27;s impossible to say. Also, this has been tertiary priority so far. We&#x27;ve been prioritizing patching and security issues over this.
 Ok, how soon can we deploy this?
 It&#x27;s impossible to say. Would you like to prioritize this convenience item over patching and security concerns?
 Obviously patching has to come first, but when can we get this one done.
 FFS, ID-F&#x27;N-K. 
 ​
 seriously..... What am I expected to do? just quote some random bullshit time frame that I pull out of my ass on the spot? There are 60ish components in the convenience item, that have to each be individually developed, tested, verified, etc.

                              <span>I have been my own, one man shop MSP that does Break/fix, deployment, management, and service of both IT and AV equipment for going on 15 years. 
 I&#x27;m ready to move on/switch to a different career field. Preferably one where I don&#x27;t have to travel 300 miles a day. 
 Heres my issue, when looking at career opportunities - What are my actual chances of getting a non help desk job. I have 15 years of experience.... But not 15 years of experience within one ecosystem like most jobs are asking for. 
 Am I looking at the wrong job types? Am I too far down the rabbit hole to switch careers now?

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure there is a name for this I just don&#x27;t know what it is. Other than corporate fat.
 All the chatter recently had me thinking about this and I&#x27;ve been helping a farmer the past couple of weekends finish up his harvest where we are hustling all day which is a loose comparison to IT but there&#x27;s no Pingpong table or game room to slip off to (this is a big company reference). (and feels good for a change of pace.)
 I was thinking about the 8 companies I&#x27;ve worked at over the past 22 years other than the super small companies with 1 or 2 people in the whole IT department every place I&#x27;ve worked at has so many wasted hours. 
 I&#x27;ve hired on at more than one place where they are going on about being swamped and then it&#x27;s two weeks before I even get a laptop and spend half the day chatting with everyone or listening to them complain about policies. 
 Then in every place with a team of people, there have always one or two superstars and the rest are just there either doing busy work or not really doing anything. 
 Next are all the meetings, the bigger the company the more you have, and the more you just get invited to for no reason other than you replied to an email one time. Of course, there are always people who just love to take advantage of this rather than get work done. 
 I&#x27;ve been on both sides of it too. I worked at one place in the early 2000s where I spent six months going to quiet rooms in the building and spending the day playing Civilization V without anyone noticing or caring. I&#x27;ve also been the superstar who&#x27;s spent a solid 30-40 hours a week getting something done. 
 This is just my opinion but overall from what I&#x27;ve seen in corporate America the next major recession we are going to see job reductions in IT similar to what happened to manufacturing jobs in 2008. And those job nubmers never returned to pre 2008 levels.

 The main purpose of this site is to provide a comprehensive list of all DMARC vendors on the market for visibility, give consumers option consideration, as well as only the highest-quality learning resources to ensure the correct information is spread, and prevent misinformation or misconceptions, as is very prevalent with many sources on the Internet.
 Roast me if you will, I&#x27;m not a web developer. :&quot;)
 I have plans to add more content for DMARC/DKIM authentication tools and others in the future as well.
 Edit: fixed typo.

I believe I saw a post or a post reply here a while ago talking about a solution, I think by blocking it via a User policy GPO instead of Computer policy, or maybe vice versa? But I can&#x27;t remember, and I can&#x27;t find that post/reply now. Does anyone by any chance remember the solution?

Looking for recommendations on a decent network cable tester and/or other similar tools - we have a server room that is an absolute cabling nightmare, with nothing mapped out or written down anywhere, and I suspect that several ethernet cable runs in the ceiling are dead or unplugged.
 What are you all using to get these type of jobs done? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I inherited the wonderful responsibility of having to approve new softwares to be introduced to our environment. Basically, as of now, users submit requests for new softwares to the helpdesk, and then they ask my team to review the software prior to allowing it to be installed. The only issue with this current process is that, I have exactly zero idea how other medium sized enterprises validate software. My question is two fold.
 ​
 Firstly, what information do you request from the users when they ask for a new software to be introduced to the environment. So far this is the list i&#x27;ve come up with.
  
1. Is there existing software that can be used
 2. Business need for software
 3. Is this for a project
 4. What is the impact if this software is not approved
 5. What specific task will get done using this software.
  
Secondly, how do you know if the software is safe to introduce? Right now, here is what I do..
  
Run the software installer through our EDR sandbox
 Check if the installation is signed
 Try installing the software on a test box
 Googling the software / the hash
  
The only issue with my current method is that a lot of times our engineers find these really niche tools from github etc that do extremely specific things. I don&#x27;t have a good way of validating any of these as I can&#x27;t read through the code and understand what they do in a timely fashion. That would take me several days / weeks if I did that for every software. Any advice would be great!

                              <span>So I do work for many smaller village and town halls in NY. A lot of them use old software like Impact, Incode, KVS and absolute garbage like that, if you&#x27;re familiar. Most of them are looking for new software (finally) but i don&#x27;t really have any suggestions. I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff, but i was wondering if any of you fine folks would have any ideas.
 EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions. I didn&#x27;t think my post would get much traction and I appreciate the feedback.

                              <span>Hi!
 I have a problem with Win Server 2012, I dont know where to look... Server has 2 NICs one NIC is working normally with 1 Gbps the other one is strange, at least for me. When I copy a file directly from the server to another workstation the speed is ok with 1 Gbps, but when I reach the Server from LAN the same workstation the copy speed is like limited to 200Mbps. Where should I look for the problem?
 Thanks

                              <span>We are currently running FreeRADIUS with Google Authenticator on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server. This is used in our Horizon environment, the UAG points to this for authentication. Since we have had various issues with this server, instead of upgrading the current server, I have been tasked with standing up a new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server and setting this up with FreeRADIUS and Google Auth, then migrating over the configuration/database to avoid having to enroll all users with Google Auth again. I did some research but did not find too much information on how to easily migrate the Google Auth database to the new server. I found these two articles (Clone and Restore FreeRADIUS Setup and Sharing Google Auth Keys), but I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work. Does anyone have experience with a migration like this, who could point me in the right direction?

 What I&#x27;m not sure about is this: so inbox 1 last synced 30 minutes ago. Inbox 2 last synced yesterday at 5:54PM. Inbox 3 last synced at 2:21PM. There is still mail arriving to these inboxes, and I want to make sure that no mail get&#x27;s left behind when I complete the migration and swap the MX records. Does a &quot;final sync&quot; run when I approve or complete the migration batch? And if not, then how do I ensure the mail in the recipient inbox is up-to-date the minute of the switch?
 The mail account domains need to be the same while the migration runs on the sending and receiving end, due to this we can&#x27;t set a forward that will work. So assuming there is no way to do this &quot;final sync&quot; I suppose I could complete the migration batch on Thursday evening, swap their 365 accounts to .onmicrosoft.com, set up the forward from the Gmail accounts until they leave on Friday while manually sending over the few emails that may have been missed by the migration sync, change the MX, then log on and set up their profiles. Bit of a long way around it but eh there&#x27;s only 5 users.

                              <span>Hello all, recently purchased a refurb DL380 Gen9 with the NVMe enablement kit (part no 774741-B21 which consists of a PCIe NVMe controller, drive cage with backplane and 3 PCI express cables). I installed 6 x Kingston DC1500M drives (firmware version S67F0103, no newer available) and whilst they all work, I can only get PCI express Gen 3 link speed on port 1 &amp; 2 of the controller. The other 4 drives (port 3, 4, 5 and 6) only operate at Gen 1 link speed.
 Output in lspci with correct speed (port 1 &amp; 2):
  LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Output in lspci with slower speed (port 3, 4, 5, 6):
  LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Things I tried:
  
Reset BIOS: no change. There are also no options to configure link speeds.
 Move drives around: no change. It doesn&#x27;t matter which drive is connected where, port 1 &amp; 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the other run at Gen 1
 Move cables around: no change
 Swap cable connections: connected port 1 &amp; 2 to port 5 &amp; 6 on the backplane. Still only port 1 &amp; 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the the other run at Gen 1. That rules out a backplane problem
 Swapped NVMe controller: no change
 Connect only port 5 &amp; 6: runs at Gen 3
 Firmware upgrade of NVMe controller: was already at latest version 1.78
 All other firmware is up to date
  
So it looks like in whatever combination, I can only get 2 of the 6 drives to run at full Gen 3 speed whilst the other downgrade to Gen 1. There are some jumpers on the NVMe controller but I can&#x27;t find any documentation on what they do and I doubt it&#x27;s going to make a difference anway. Needless to say this quite kneecaps the performance of the NVMe drives... Anything else I can try?

                              <span>We&#x27;re a US-based user of Exchange Online and DKIM. Recently I noticed in our reports that messages sent by our people traveling in the EU were not DKIM-signed. The messages originated at a European MS server, so they passed SPF and therefore DMARC, but I&#x27;m wondering if the lack of a DKIM signature is expected behavior or if I need to involve MS Tech Support. Thanks.

I&#x27;ve an HP laptop with 1TB of HDD and to joke, some years ago, I&#x27;ve maked a hidden partition on disk 0 (the only one i have) (C:) with gparted on a VM with GNU Linux, and the hidden partition was with half of my hdd, after that I forgotted about the VM and made the factory reset of the PC and i removed every data just to get also my full hdd back, but first the factory reset did nothing to reverse the Linux partition and also after the reset, opening disk management (diskmgmt.msc) in Windows 11 it still couldn&#x27;t see the hidden partition of Linux, because for diskmgmt it wasn&#x27;t there, not even unallocated, it just couldn&#x27;t rlly be seen.
 After that i saw a lot of guides and i tryed to do it with diskpart in cmd, and the series of command was: list disk, select disk 0, but arriv…</span>

 I&#x27;ve been tasked with managing the devices that play YouTube TV on TVs at our HQ. Currently we are using a couple Windows based devices and it&#x27;s a real pain. Does anyone have any recommendations for devices they use for streaming?
 Requirements would be: 
  
Continuous YouTube TV play with high reliability
 Can be controlled remotely
 4k Output
  
Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>TLDR question : How are you handling your day to day roles in scenarios where the workplace is divided using Google or Microsoft ecosystem products &amp; applications because of legit business reasons but are ultimately administered using Google Workspace or Office 365 ? 
 Background:
 My office of 300+ ppl running Google workspace, just acquired another company of 200+ employees who are using Office 365. Management felt it necessary that the company be unified under one platform and the ball is currently in my team&#x27;s court to figure out which one will be culled and which one will live on.
 A survey across departments was done and we found that sales, accounts, HR and top management mostly love Google workspace because of the &quot;simplicity&quot;. They primarily use cloud apps, CRM and ERP.

                              <span>Hi, i manade UPD in the past but never implementation
 So the customer have 1 RDS server atm with Desktop/documents configured for Folder redirection
 Customer wants to implement a 2nd RDS server, so we will build a RDS farm with load balancing for the 2 servers and we plan to implement UDP for roaming profiles so here are my questions
 ​
 1) IF we implement UPD for every folders, should we remove the folder redirection for, or we can keep both?
 2) Since we already have local profiles on the first RDS, is it easy to implement a 2nd RDS build a farm and configure UDP, or we will have to rebuild local users folder on both servers since the C:\users will be in the UPD instead of the server itself?
 ​
 Thanks

 Say that I got a group called &quot;Employees&quot; and I send an invitation for a meeting to 5 out of 30 people in this group, everyone gets a notification to the meeting but they can&#x27;t join because they are not invited. 
 Everything have been working fine for the longest time, but this error just showed up today.. Anyone who&#x27;ve been into something simular to this? All I want is for the people who are not invited to not get a notification. And even if they are not in the group there are still some who gets a notification.
 Sorry if its unclear what I mean.

                              <span>I have no experience in the field but I’m in school for Cyber Security. I had gotten an offer for a Sys Admin position and it’s a little more than $17 an hour. It’s on site and I’m a mom so I would have to pay for day care and I’m near DC, day care is super expensive around here. Luckily my boyfriend works and makes the money, so it could work. But not sure if $20 an hour is enough, especially for where I live.
 I’m just not sure if I should take this position. Maybe it could be a good entry level experience for me to move up but again, I’m studying for Cyber Security and have 0 experience in the field at all. Thoughts? Should I take the position?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to scan all our mobile devices for their eSIM capability and so far I&#x27;ve come up empty.
 We are considering switching from physical SIM cards to eSIM but did not take note of the IDs when we received the devices. And we&#x27;ve got a few different iterations of devices even within the same modell (Gen1, Gen2, ..) so it isn&#x27;t entirely clear to us which devices support eSIM or not.
 Scanning for regular broadband internet capability is easy enough:
  
netsh mbn show interfaces
  
And even getting information about regular SIM cards is no problem:
  
netsh mbn show read interface&#x3D;*
  
But I can&#x27;t find an easy way to figure out whether a device supports eSIM or not.
 Reading https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/esim-device-configuration and https://www.petervanderwoude.nl/post/configuring-esim-profiles-on-windows-devices/ lead me to believe that I somehow should be able to get at least the ICCID somehow. But the first netsh command above only returns the regular broadband adapter with no hint whether the device supports eSIM or not.
 Further reading brought me to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/mb-esim-operations and the &quot;Hardware Lab Kit&quot; test from Microsoft which is supposed to feature a &quot;netsh mbn test feature&#x3D;esim&quot; test but ... this feels way out of scope (settings up a HLK server and whatnot) for something that ... I feel should be a lot simpler.
 The only way I&#x27;ve found so far is manually checking the broadband settings GUI of the settings app for the availability of eSIM profiles. Which is ... not great for automation.
 Does anyone have a better idea on how to scan for eSIM capability? (Preferably something PowerShell or cmd.exe (netsh) if needed. No Azure or Intune (we use SCCM).)

I am having hard time to set up DNS authentication for the sendgrid for my domain bought in bluehost. Firstly bluehost does not appear within the domain provider to select from the drop down menu on sendrig authentication setup guide. Once I set up name manually, provided CNAME records are not being reognized by S at Sendgrid at all. If it makes some change, my bluehost domain NS is being pointed to wordpress. Thanks a lot for any reply in advance

                              <span>I need to copy 10TB of files and folders, so I am familiarizing myself with Robocopy. Basically, I want an exact copy, with all timestamps, attributes, and everything else exactly the same at the new location, so that it&#x27;s essentially impossible to tell it from the original.
 So far I have come up with:
 ROBOCOPY D:\Source E:\Destination /MIR /COPYALL /DCOPY:DAT
 Pretty basic, am I missing anything?
 Thanks!

 Robocopy /mir is equivalent to the /e /purge options in Robocopy with a small difference in behavior. With the /e /purge options, a destination directories security settings are not overwritten. When using the /mir option, the security settings for the destination directory are overwritten.
  
 What is a security settings of directory?
 Is this referring to the security tab that appears after right clicking on a folder &gt;property&gt;security tab and the settings therein ?

However I noticed that most services - e.g. google workspace, zoho, yahoo etc have email rate limits set to around 50-60 emails received per minute and then they reject the rest. No, I&#x27;m not a spammer, I&#x27;m looking to receive emails lol.
 I&#x27;m looking to receive around 1000 emails in a minute at some point. Is there any suggestion of what I can do to make sure that I receive these emails? It is not continuously 1000 per minute, it is just approx 1000 all in one go in one minute and then that is it for a long time (days).
 Is there any paid service I could use that doesn&#x27;t have such rate limits? If not, what do you suggest?
 Thanks

                              <span>Morning All,
 ​
 At my wits end here and not sure where else to turn since Microsoft are unable to help.
 ​
 We recently have been trialling a new backup solution, to start with it was working fine, then when we expanded it to more servers we started seeing the issue where the avhdx files are being created but cannot be merged because &quot;Error: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. (0x80070020)&quot;
 ​
 We also have an important server that we want replicated to another site and are unable to replicate because the HRL file also cannot be processed because of the same error.
 ​
 This is affecting multiple servers, with different versions of windows, 2016, 2019 and 2022.
 ​
 Suspected a windows update, removed the last few and rebooted, no change, removed the backup solutions agent and rebooted, same, no change.
 ​
 As a temporary fix, I shut down the VM, removed the VHDX file from the VM settings and moved it to a different folder then re-added the file to VM settings.
 ​
 Checkpoints seem to work and the backup solution will run fine manually, but then it will eventually stop working again.
 ​
 We used to use Veeam, but this has been removed. We also have another solution installed that we were going to use but never configured. I believe this is based around Acronis, but as I said, its not running anything, just installed.
 ​
 Any suggestions?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>For weeks now I have been trying to wrap my head around a problem I just can&#x27;t figure out. I&#x27;ll try to explain it as best as I can.
 We are providing our users with Dell Latitute computers. At the moment we have anything from 7490 to 7430, and somewhere around 5320/7420 the problems started to arise.
 We issue our users with Jabra Evolve2 65 headsets so they can participate in Skype for Business meetings (we are not allowed to use Teams, don&#x27;t ask...). It all seems to be working well, until after a week or two when the users who have been issued with a new computer comes back and complains that Skype is crashing when they use the headset. If they connect the USB dongle whatever sound settings you open (be it Skype or Windows), will freeze the program. 
 I thought it was just a simple problem with Jabra, but after testing more thoroughly it turns out the problems are there for any USB sound dongle from any brand. We&#x27;ve tried updating the Realtek driver, and that works but only for a while once again, or just makes the Sound settings incredibly slow to navigate, not entirely frozen. Its also not universal which computers work decently with new drivers, and which will still not work.
 The problem is now big enough we can&#x27;t decide on new headsets to buy, because we simply don&#x27;t know if we can make them work. Are we the only ones with this issue, or has someone else found a solution to get us through this dongle hell hole?

 MFA attacks are becoming more prevalent, which makes the introduction of such security measures very vital. But how will you cope with it? 
 However, lacking any of the necessary upgrades will put you out! So, follow the suggestions below and educate your users, before Microsoft starts rolling out number matching by default.
  
User authentication will fail if they use a version of the Authenticator app that does not support a number match.

 I&#x27;m currently trying to make a &quot;golden&quot; image with a virtual machine that has some basic things set up, such as microsoft office, and a few other small things we usually install.
 ​
 But in the process I wanted to see if I can make the usb installation more hands off with a unattend file, but I keep running into the issue that a product key is needed. The few things i&#x27;ve tried are using the windows 11/10 pro general key under the windows-setup/UserData/ProductKey, not having the point to having the point but no licesnse. But still the same error about not being able to read the 
 part from the answerfile.
 ​
 How do you guys usually handle this?
 ​
 I&#x27;d preferably not have a license in the unattend file, since the computers all come with pro, and I want to activate the already given license.

                              <span>I have experience working with dual boot pc-s, setting them up and hacking them (in the old sense of the word) but only 1 at a time. Now, I the computer science teacher became the sysadmin of the school where I teach and I should get them in shape. Now Ubuntu and Windows 10 Pro are installed and every PC has one user with admin rights (yikes!). I would like to change this.
 I have a general idea and I know that I&#x27;m capable of hacking something together but I would like to do it in a proper way, e.g. in a way which probably requires me to put in more effort in the beginning but it should then spare me headaches in the future.
 My idea in general is the following: Students should learn how to (de)install apps, use said apps + MS Office + webbrowsing, get to know the OS-s (Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu), learn the basics of fotoshop, do some programming in Python and execute them in the command line. On the other hand, it would be nice if let&#x27;s say after midnight every PC would return to its original state which would prevent the students to do nasty stuff. The student would need to store everything in the cloud of on a USB-stick. The cherry on the pie would be the fact that the PC-s update themselves whenever needed. I&#x27;m thinking about maybe even creating a user for every student? But that seems a bit unnecessary, given that they can only access the PC-s in the school and not much else.
 Is there any software which already has this bundle? Or how does one achieve these goals without reinventing the wheel?

 Just wanted to see if anyone can share their experiences of being on MS estate (Intune for device management, Azure AD for authentication, etc.) yet primarily using AWS as their main cloud provider. Does such a setup even exists?

                              <span>Hello, community.
 On my laptop Dell Latitude 5410 ( with Windows 10 ) I have installed VMware Workstation Player 16 and inside it I have an AlpineLinux ( with static IP 192.168.1.114 ) with a VPNC client for company private networks . For this I use a route in windows ( route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.114 -p ).
 When I use Ethernet connection (cable) everything works fine, but when I use Wifi card/connection I can&#x27;t connect to these private networks.
 The VPNC client connects to the networks and I have connectivity to the private networks from AlpineLinux but not from Windows.
 I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the network drivers (wifi and ethernet) and nothing changes.
 On that VM I use the &quot;Bridged: Directly connected to physical network&quot; connection.
 Thanks a lot.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m into a system admin and a lot of things about. I&#x27;m kind of new into the subject and I think it&#x27;s very interesting and stimulating as well as rewarding.
 I have a problem since i&#x27;m working with windows desktop base machine and these days the windows update are actually breaking the link with the AD or Domain.
 I&#x27;d like to know if there&#x27;s a possibility to disable Windows Updates &quot;forever&quot;/OnceForAll&quot; with a policy in the AD. I&#x27;d like to have a group policy so nobody can&#x27;t update windows or better. That no one is able to choose that option.
 I don&#x27;t know if it sounds like very difficult or if there&#x27;s way to deactivate for a group.
 Thanks alot in advance.
 I&#x27;ve been learning a lot the couple of month and I think with the redditors and community I feel motivated and please keep learning and sharing. &#x3D;)

                              <span>Hi there fellow Sysadmins!
 I‘d like to have some advice on a migration/integration topic:
 I was tasked to plan the integration of the infrastructure of another company into mine.
 Both infrastructures contain an Active Directory and Azure Environment as well as Intune/Endpoint manager.
 Needless to say that I’ve never done that before – and my knowledge of Active Directory stems from my apprenticeship which was many years ago. In the meantime, I’ve worked with an IAM solution like Okta. 
 While the way the new accounts are created follow a fully automatic process,
 I wonder if there is an “easy” way to migrate all mailboxes, teams, groups, and MDM devices. All I found were guides that seem to include a huge amount of manual work – or deeper knowledge of PowerShell. There solutions might turn out to be frictionless and not that hard, but I cannot evaluate that based on my knowledge/experience.
 So, I see two ways to solve that problem:
 1) Get into the PowerShell Scrips to automate parts of the progress
 2) Search for a full featured migration tool that handles the work for me
 For the second point – of course it will be less effort, but my main concern on that topic is time. It must be done as soon as possible. 
 I am looking forward to getting some new insides into this.
 Thanks in advance for every advice

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I&#x27;m looking for some guidance as a very green sysadmin. I&#x27;ve recently joined a new MSP as a Support Engineer. I went out to work on a VPN connection issue the other day and noticed something extremely badly configured. I suspect the reason we&#x27;re having so many issues is that the clients&#x27; LAN is on a 192.168.1.x/24 subnet...the most common subnet ISP routers provide.
 I&#x27;m fairly new here, but I looked around the firewall and found a ton of NAT rules that are basically trying to get around this problem of &quot;What happens when you&#x27;re on 192.168.1.x and you try to connect via SSL VPN to LAN that is also 192.168.1.x so you can RDP into a machine &quot; 
 Obviously, this is a bad configuration I think what needs to happen is that network needs to be on VLAN with a more corporate-friendly subnet(172.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x) but I honestly don&#x27;t know where to start. No one&#x27;s going to fix it without a nudge, or they might do something nutty like I&#x27;ve seen already and just make an interface with a 172.x.x.x IP on the firewall and NAT *Everything* through that. Where do I start with a plan to fix this network?

 I&#x27;m curious if you have suggestions for a learn to code course that would be okay for a parent and child to take together? In addition, my kiddo had dyslexia, so a text heavy approach is a non-starter.

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I´m having a problem regarding a surface pro 7.
 I wanted to reinstall windows on said surface using a bootstick I prepared with Windows 10.
 I accidentally picked the wrong stick with Surface Hub OS on it.
 Since the installation is the same as a normal Win10 installation I ran through it and noticed that I installed Surface Hub OS on my Surface Pro 7,
 Now I tried to get rid of it in the following ways:
  
Win10 Bootstick
 LinuxLive Bootstick
 Surface Reset Stick with Serial Number
 Surface Hub Reset Stick with Serial Number (from a real Surface hub because the Surface Pro 7 isn´t a Surface Hub)
 Resetting the UEFI firmware
  
Everything I tried didn´t work.
 When trying to boot from USB it either kicks me back to BIOS or it just boots up SurfaceHub.
 Since the UEFI firmware reset it gives a red line on the bootscreen but it kicks me back to BIOS though.
 I don´t know what to do since MS Professionals recommend booting from a Win10 stick *facepalm*
 I hope someone can help.
 PS: I already heard someone say &quot;just get the ssd out and partition it on another device&quot; but since it´s a surface and I don´t want any soldering action I don´t want to try that.

                              <span>Guess this is an age old question and no easy way out.
 We have a large shared file area on a windows file server with all the different departments etc on it. Now this thing has been about for a long time. I&#x27;m talking windows NT old. It&#x27;s been moved/robocopied etc into it&#x27;s current location over the years. As data grows (as it does) it&#x27;s become more and more blotted with old data etc. 
 I&#x27;m trying to find an effective way to find the stuff thats not been used for a x number of years? Then once it&#x27;s a lot clear turn on fsrm to stop the big stuff being dumped there.
 I&#x27;ve used treesize etc to look at the most used etc but it&#x27;s lacking on how old stuff is.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m turning to you guys for help. I don&#x27;t know if what I&#x27;m looking for is possible, hence maybe you guys can help me out. 
 I have a private laptop (Dell Inspiron 7391 2-in-1) and a work Laptop (HP Elitebook). Both notebooks support thunderbolt. I have 1 monitor (Lenovo Thinkvision), 1 mouse, 1 keyboard, 1 headset and a external harddrive. 
  
I am looking for a compatible docking station for both laptops and my periphery devices. Something I can just connect one laptop, and then pull out and connect the other laptop (one at a time). I have been looking at the Targus 190 and the Dell WD 19TBS. 
 I was also wondering can you hook up a KVM switch to a docking station? So that you can just switch between the computers with a press of a button? If no, can you hook up a KVM switch to a monitor? I have the UGREEN USB 3.0 Switch - but it somehow doesn&#x27;t hook up my monitor. 
  
​
 Thanks for your help - sorry if these questions are a bit &quot;dumb&quot;. 
 Cheers

I followed this guide when I was installing Ubuntu (part from &quot;If you cannot disable or unplug the disk with Windows 10&quot;, also the same thing is said here), i.e. I installed Ubuntu, turned off some flags on Windows, installed Grub on Ubuntu and turned back on flag on Windows. Now I can choose when booting: windows or ubuntu. Now I want to move my windows to m2 ssd. So my question is, how do I correctly install now Windows so I won&#x27;t lose my Ubuntu installation? Because it says when installing windows is doing something that will break the boot and it will see only Windows as loading option or something like this. Both Windows and Ubuntu were installed on GPT with UEFI.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I got a question but I feel like I first have to explain the background a little bit: I have a customer with very specific requests. They need a system of 4 client and 2 server machines (will all be Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022) together with some additional network hardware (NAS, printers). The special thing is that this small network will run completely isolated and will not be connected to WAN or any other networks (for a fact I&#x27;m planning on physically plugging non used LAN ports on all devices). They need an AD running but only with generic users (Factory User, Storage User and so on) and no personal users. One of the servers will function as a Domain Controller. And They need that exact same system running on several different sites across the country. Like it has to be exactly the same, down to every single AD user.
 So since the the setup will be identical on all sites and not connected to the outside whatsoever, I had the idea to set this up in my lab one time, configure it to the customers likes and then just take images from every machine. If then the order for a site arrives, I could just use my specific images to prepare the machines. I&#x27;ve done it like that before but never with an AD involved, hence my questions. Oh and we use Symantec Ghost for imaging, if that matters. So here my questions:
  
Can you think of anything arguing against cloning AD machines, for example a Domain Controller?
 When I clone all machines after they are added to the AD and then restore these images on other machines, will they be added properly to the new site&#x27;s AD (since the hostnames get cloned as well) or will this be spotty? I could join them to the AD manually for each site if need be, but it would increase the workload.
 Overall thoughts / input on my plan?
  
Thanks in advance and have a nice week.

                              <span>my office was recently hit by the Lockbit3.0 ransomware, we had 2 servers, 1 is linked to the internet (mainly for file sharing and storage) , the other only linked to local network (for accounting and other related programmes database and sharing). The offline one is completely dead everything locked which is wiped and reinstall. The other one my employee unplugged when it was &quot;being infected&quot; so only around 40% files locked. Personally i suspect its from phishing email or something, Our IT consultant (external, with us for about 10 years) says they could have somehow found out network vulnerability and hacked us. (which i find unbelievable). And he suggest us to upgrade both the servers and buy some other anti virus and such. amounting to around USD 10k each. (im not from US).
 I personally dont see how this can prevent the same thing to happen next time, but i do agree one of the server is quite old so could do some upgrade. just looking at other options here.
 i have read about synology or NAS or cloud stuff, in fact anything is welcomed as im not an IT guy. we have around 15 employees, max 20, usually all need to use the printers, server files and programme concurrently. 
 Thanks

 Anyone have insights into how in demand this equipment/feature of networking is? I understand it load balances, but thought F5&#x27;s were the main appliances in that front?

 Working on a business/remote network. I have zero experience with weatherproof networking systems. 
 I have some pretty decent experience with Ubiquiti UniFi systems through my own homelab. 
 My wife owns her own business, horiticulturist, and grows in greenhouses. I have a remote monitoring system(SensorPush) for monitoring RH, temperature, etc... 
 The greenhouses are quite a distance away from my house. Due to amount of asphault and other obstacles, I am unable to run direct burial/UG ethernet to the house. So instead, I&#x27;ve decided to run a pair of Ubiquiti airMAX NanoBeam AC 5GHz Bridge units. Pole mounted outdoors at the growing site, and indoors using the NanoBeam 16 Window Mount in the house. I have LoS except for some tree limbs. Plenty of bandwidth availability accordi…</span>

As a prerequesite, based on the upgrade matrix I also needed to upgrade the rommon as well, so I upgraded this to (173-1r). After upgrading both rommon and the ios code, I am beginning to see issues with using 10G Interfaces on the router. When enabling my 10g interfaces, I see the following msg:

                              <span>Hi, Im new in networking, about one year in with ccna, learning for my encore exam and I work in a noc/msp for a big Cisco distributor so I get a lot of exposure to these kind of cisco products, including their troublehsooting files.
 Any suggestions on where to learn to better troubleshoot these technologies? 
 - For example where to learn more about DNAC cli commands.
 - Or a recent ticket Ive worked on was some kind of kubernetes error when trying to add the 3rd cluster in a brand new dnac deployment. 
 - Another type of ticket we often get at my job is ISE guest portal issues which are a lot and almost always requires deep inspection of APs and WLC tech support as well. 
 - Or the UCS tech support is a zip with a ton of folders and subfiles. Is there any documentation describes these f…</span>

 theoretical and not yet implemented method are fine for me.

                              <span>Hi! I have this NIC in a Dell PowerEdge R630, and when connected to my switch (Huawei S5300-28X-LI-24S-AC) 10G port, it doesn&#x27;t show any light of it working. I&#x27;m using Proxmox, and it recognizes those ports. Using OM3 LC-LC fiber from fs.com and Cisco SFP-10G-SR V03 transceivers. The NIC supports SFP+, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s either the switch or the transceivers. Did try different cable and different transceivers (same model though), but it didn&#x27;t make any difference.
 ​
 Edit: Mellanox CX311A ConnectX-3 in a different server works on that switch.

                              <span>Im about to move into my dads old workshop. Since i dont want to pay for my own internet connection, i wanted to run a cable. It doesent have to be fast, even 100mbit would be plenty since its just for the internet connection. Its a 70m run and i need to put it into the same conduit as the cables running from the solar panels to the power inverter. My first thought was to use a fiber optic cable, but i&#x27;d rather use cat 5e since its cheaper. Im going to connect the cable to a telekom speedport smart 4. 
 My questions now are:
  
Will the solar panel cables cause any interference, even if i use a shielded cable?
 Will i need to boost the signal with a switch or something?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a cloud based WAF service by a European owned company (Cloud Act).
 I have used both Akamai and Cloudflare on previous companies. Both of which basically did the job of hiding our origin, and also the basics in filtering traffic and some caching (with various success).
 In this case the only requirement is that the WAF service is operated by a European based company. The rest is probably more like, work with what you get. Since I don&#x27;t expect the same type of services like Cloudflare where i can easily hook up an existing Terraform provider have the automation done within a few hours.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Hoping for a bit of help with this one as it&#x27;s driving me crazy.
 I&#x27;ve got a handful of users whose laptop intermittenly will boot them off wifi, and take 1-3 minutes to be able to rejoin a wifi network. 
 This only occurs on the corporate network at the office, only on windows 11 computers (But not to all windows 11 computers).
 Wifi setup is some older Meraki mr18&#x27;s (I know I want them upgraded, but budgets). I&#x27;ve been unable to replicate this on my own device.
 Wifi drivers are at latest, devices are 1-3 year old dell latitudes, win 11 at latest version.
 The only error that might be related that I can find in the logs is the below:
 The server could not bind to the transport \Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{7579EFB6-7F3D-4D48-B802-A9E2614865D9} because another computer on the network has the same name. The server could not start. 
 They seem to think that another device has the same hostname as them (Despite this 100% not being the case).
 No errors on the DHCP server.
 Issue does not appear when the laptops are connected to other external networks, IE Home, the coffee shop, etc
 I have been pulling my hair out about this for weeks and the best available on google is &quot;It&#x27;s a non issue it doesn&#x27;t mean anything&quot;, &quot;Turn off power saving on the device&quot; (Didn&#x27;t work), and other similar inneffective fixes. 
 I would love a second set of eyes, thanks in advance guys!

                              <span>Hi,
 We have an old IBM x3650 M1 (machine type: 7979, model: B7M) that’s just suddenly shuts down. Error from IMM says “Planar Voltage Channel Fault” though I can’t find any explanation/references from the web. Did any of you experienced this? Is there a possible fix other than moving to a new server?
 Thanks

Basic web links seem to work ok, but anything trying to redirect such as a teams meeting will trigger the &quot;please enter the code we emailed you to enroll this device&quot; routine for any unique meeting address. I saw some suggestions that disabling all the privacy/security features on the phones may resolve the issue, but it is not a great look to ask users to kneecap their own device security because we can&#x27;t be bothered to fix our configuration.

                              <span>Hi,
 So, long story short, I just started re-modeling network for one of customers and the problem is I need to put 12U of hardware to 9U cabinet…
 The easiest solution would be obviously to replace current cabinets with proper ones but as always there’s a caveat. They all are “build in” the walls. Recessed about 30cm and welded directly to metal construction of the building.
 Replacing them would be extremely difficult and expensive and would include painting all 4 offices…
 So my “standard” setup for each of them is
 24 port patch panel for fiber
 48 port patch panel for CCTV
 Two or three 48 port patch panels for regular network jacks 
 Aggregation switch for fiber that’s linking all 4 buildings and for all others switches from the cabinet
 Separate cctv switch that has its own fiber uplink to the main server room 
 Two or three switches for regular network 
 2U NVR for CCTV
 2U UPS also for CCTV
 it’s minimum of 12 and in the biggest building 14U
 Just writing that I realized that I could move all NVRs to the main server room, I don’t like having all eggs in one basket but that is kind of not much of a choice situation. But this is still at best 1U or 2U above my rack size.
 In all of that “desperation” I started thinking that maybe I could somehow secure UPS outside, to the bottom of the rack cabinet? OMG

I ask because I did the math for my new org and I&#x27;m averaging 5 calls per on-call day, for the past 7 months. I feel like this is shift-work; not on-call. Am I being unreasonable to think that?

                              <span>Can one implement WH4B and eliminate the use of passwords (hence 90 day password rotation, etc.) and force only bio-metric or PIN? If the risk is username/passwords, then one should be able to eliminate passwords at a domain level. Right? Of course, service accounts and secondary userids (for sys admins that are in a password vault) will need passwords,.

                              <span>I was trying to configure app-only authentication for running unattended Powershell scripts for offboarding in Exchange Online. I followed Microsoft&#x27;s documentation and met all the specified requirements, but encountered a bug which prevented me from using Connect-IPPSSession.
 When running the command with a known-working app and certificate, I was given the modern auth user signing dialog. This didn&#x27;t happen with the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet. 
 After some frustration, I finally found a recent stackexchange post which described this issue, and provided a workaround. 
 The issue appears to be that the module assumes the existence of an environment variable that only exists in Powershell Core. The workaround is to manually provide that value in your script by adding this:
 $Global:IsWindows &#x3D; $true
 I&#x27;m not sure how to report this bug to the correct team at Microsoft. It was reported in the Powershell github, but closed there.

I&#x27;ve been using the service for ages both at work and home. Unfortunately a few months ago it disappeared all of a sudden and I tried several alternatives, but none seemed to be as flexible.
 By chance, today I found it&#x27;s already available here
 I know for a fact this will make many happy since at work it has always been a popular tool among colleagues.

                              <span>Does anyone here have a recommendation for aggregating and forwarding logs? I will be likely implementing an MSSP in the next few months, but expect I will likely will want to supplement with my own logging platform for non-security related purposes. I don&#x27;t want to have to change the configuration throughout my environment if I decide to add a second destination or change MSSPs. I would like to have a single point of aggregation and distribution for my logs. 
 It appears using Windows Event Forwarder for my Windows systems and a syslog-ng system for everything else might work, but in both cases, it seems like there might be real-world issues as platforms may misinterpret the source for all events as being the two forwarders.
 Everything I find on this topic seems to be cover centralizing at one point, but nothing about then forwarding again. Maybe there is a good reason?

 I&#x27;ve enabled the features that seem to be required:
 Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName &#x27;DataCenterBridging&#x27; Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-DataCenterBridging-LLDP-Tools 
 And then done Enable-NetLldpAgent - it seems like it should be enabled:
 &gt; Get-NetLldpAgent ifAlias : SLOT 3 Port 1 ifIndex : 14 Scope : NearestBridge MacAddress : {00-0E-1E-9D-D2-A0} ifAlias : SLOT 3 Port 2 ifIndex : 18 Scope : NearestBridge MacAddress : {00-0E-1E-9D-D2-A2} 
 but the switch isn&#x27;t showing LLDP info.
 Am I missing something really obvious?

 I have a dual boot setup with 2 separate drives, as well as a storage drive. I would like to isolate the other main drive and storage drive from the current Windows 11 installation and set up a Local Group Policy to prevent drive attribute changes.
 I&#x27;m aware that it is possible to add a policy to prevent a user from accessing a drive in My Computer but the policy states that:
  
Also, this policy setting does not prevent users from using programs to access these drives or their contents. And, it does not prevent users from using the Disk Management snap-in to view or change drive characteristics. I&#x27;m also aware that an administrator can reverse these changes but I&#x27;m trying to make it difficult for a user without administrative rights to change these conditions.
  
Can someone help me please? Thank you.

                              <span>For quite some time I have been doing support for high-end storage infrastructures and I saw that a lot of Linux administrators are struggling with troubleshooting storage related issues on Linux systems. This led me to write a book about it when many of the most common problems are addressed. As the introduction already implies, it is fairly impossible to cover all aspects of the entire linux storage stack, as the storage ecosystem is vast. Nevertheless, I do think it covers a lot of what you might/will encounter in your daily work.
 I don’t want to have this post to appear as a blunt commercial, as that is really not the intention

                              <span>Wanted to double check as I&#x27;m not the biggest security expert. However, currently we have all windows domain firewall profiles disable on all our computers. My bosses reasoning for this is that our firewall replaces the need for this? My logical reasoning says this is totally wrong. 
 Am I over thinking it? Just because we have a decent firewall doesn&#x27;t mean we should be disabling other security measures that are there to protect us.

                              <span>Hello there,
 Anybody has experience about upgrading Cisco SG550X-48 firmware? 
 I had many issues during the upgrading. I am using these switches in stacking mode with 2 or 3 stack members. I read that, these switches are upgradeable in stacking mode, so I don&#x27;t need to upgrade that individually.
 There are my experiencies:
  
case
  
Last year I upgraded a stack with 3 members from 2.5.5.47 to 2.5.8.15. I uploaded the new fw via WebGui then rebooted the switch stack. After that the network is gone on these switches.
 The problem was that the switch config is modified during the upgrade. All settings on TenGigabitEhternet port is gone. Meanwhile I had problem with the switch password. I couldn&#x27;t login with my previously used password, so I had to do a Password Recovery via console cable.

                              <span>Im struggling to identify beat solution for mass deploying applications to 600+ workstations that have a complicated installer with multiple dependancies. - for instance applications that as tied to cloud per-user licensing and vendor&#x27;s own app manager (Adobe Creative Cloud, Avid Link etc) What&#x27;s worse is that some of those apps not only have own app manager as pre-requisite, but also require additional components (drivers, anti-piracy/anti-tampering agents, bask-end licensing services) that will not get installed if running a silent install.
 I can&#x27;t find any clear guidance anywhere on how to mass deploy this..
 full disk Imaging is a potential solution but creates problems elsewhere in the chain. 
 Anyone have experience with mass deploy of such applications ?

 And the biggest flag this company is a scam is their product is exams. That&#x27;s what they do, sell exams. They&#x27;ve managed to convince people entering the field their &quot;vendor neutral&quot; certificate somehow adds value to a candidates resume. 
 Folks starting out in IT, don&#x27;t waste your money on these certs. They are grossly overpriced, they provide little value, and if you are wanting certs there are many vendor certs much cheaper that provides better value.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 When someone logs in with an alias and tries to access the farm they get the error attached here.
 What I checked:
  
It happens randomly to people in the domain.
 
There are some that work great for them and some that work for him.
 
 In terms of comparisons between computers, I compared hardware, software, operating systems, versions, etc.
  
I checked logs on RDS itself and on the broker server.
  
The broker servers work in HA configuration.
  
I checked the correct settings of the alias.
 
I dug each and every post on Google and various forums!
 
 ​
 Facts about the environment:
 All 2019 operating systems, the most advanced versions of Windows 10.
 Defaulttsvurl is the alias definition in the RDS environment, and it worked fine until this issue occurred.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help because I can&#x27;t quite find myself anymore.
 Thanks!

 I need help with the following situation. Currently I only found one solution that is to use kutools which is paid. I am looking for free option to help me with this.
 Situation:
 I have two emails,
  
[info@domainname.com](mailto:info@domainname.com)from GoDaddy
 [name@domainname.com](mailto:name@domainname.com)from GoDaddy
  
I have setup both email in outlook as pop3/smtp mail to send receive email for both id&#x27;s.
 What I want to do is that whether the email is received on email 1 or 2, but i always want to reply with email 2. I have set email 2 as default email address in outlook.
 Please help!!

 Now I have my own web app, www.example.com, where I want to setup SSO from scratch… I’ve googled a bit but my mojo is failing me to find a comprehensive guide. Anyone got something here?
 End goal is to gate the site behind SSO.

 What are the best resources for a new IT-Generalist, are there FB Groups? I couldn&#x27;t find a Subreddit, website etc? All servers are cloud based. The only hardware I&#x27;ll mess with is the switches, data, audio/video systems etc... 
  
Long Story: I am in my 30&#x27;s, I have a full time career ( 24hrs every 3rd day ) that allows me to work a side job 2-4 days a week. So over the last 15 years I&#x27;ve worked many jobs and this has allowed me to gain different skills. I&#x27;ve always been the &quot;techy&quot; guy in the family and friends while also being very DIY. Replacing engines in…</span>

                              <span>My company uses PRTG, we have 3700 devices with about 14000 sensors. 90 Locations globally. Larger company. The company has used PRTG for many years and there has never been a single app owner so it has accumulated a lot of garbage and there has been no standard ever put in place. This includes older servers using different SNMP strings, random WMI sensors, local users and groups in PRTG, etc. I am wanting to completely remodel our system and give it the attention it needs. I am also attempting to do this without too much monitoring downtime and effort. My question is though, how would other recommend setting up data center monitoring? Should I break it into folders like servers, networking, environmental. Then break it down into domain controllers, specific app, firewalls, switches, UPS, ATS, Genset, etc. Or should I break it down into different VLANs/Networks so I can use the auto discover feature?

 What is other peoples recommendations when administrating a tool like this?

                              <span>Anyone around here running racks of DL360 G10’s? We have a problem with them running hot, not internally, but more hot to touch. As in so hot they’ll burn your hand if you try to remove an SFP and hot enough to melt the labels on our fibers connected to them.
 We did note there is a vent on the top of the chassis but find it hard to believe this is related to cooling since the server is designed to be rack mounted on top of other servers without any spacing.
 This has caused some political issues with our site guys who are now insisting we space them out by 1RU which kinda defeats the purpose of purchasing a high density 1RU solution. Might as well go DL380 which is 2RU and get the extra storage capacity, but we want 1RU because our bottleneck is CPU cores.
 Anyone had any similar experience with these servers? HPE support were less than helpful lets just say.

 I am most appalled at the fact security was mentioned once, as was firewalls and windows XP.... Salesforce an intuit making the list is equaling annoying.
 Is my area just anomaly is network admin a catch all job in everyone&#x27;s market.

                              <span>I am the &quot;I.T. Guy&quot; for a company with 3 locations (around 250 endpoints). I was referred to by the owner of the company as the IT Director to a vendor we started working with. That felt AWESOME!
 My dilemma is this, we are moving away from a vendor that manages just about everything Network related, and switching to a new vendor. New system, new security, new VOIP, new email. It might actually be an actual active directory and Microsoft 365 environment....from scratch.
 I have started studying for Microaoft certs... is there anything else I should study?

                              <span>So...I&#x27;ve been tasked with doing vulnerability remediation on a number of workstations on a weekly basis. Client has said they&#x27;re old computers and as such this just happens. I&#x27;ve checked these systems and I can tell they&#x27;re receiving some sort of daily &#x27;delta&#x27; update but they&#x27;re not receiving proper Windows patches. (No, I haven&#x27;t looked at Event logs to further understand why this is the case.)
 It&#x27;s not my environment. Technically I may be able to access SCCM/MEM, perhaps create a special group for these older systems in order to deploy individual patches identified as being missing. Anyone else have ideas? Anything to beat remoting in.

                              <span>Hello,
 I created an Azure Windows 10 VM and created a user in M365 and enabled MFA for this account.
 I am using Basion and RDP to this new VM. I can login successfully using local admin through both .. RDP and Basion but not from the AzureAD user. I tried [user@domain.com](mailto:user@domain.com) / azuread/user@domain.com and the password still I get error ... Login failed please reconnect and try again.
 This user is part of Virtual machine Login as well as Virutal machine local admin in RBAC for this VM.
 I did disable NLM in the VM Remote desktop ... 
 ​
 Under work/ school it shows AAD joined 
 dsreg/status command shows its Azure ADJoined: YES 
 ​
 Any ideas how to fix this and able to login using Azure AD user ?
 ​
 Thanks in Advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeking a recommendation for a DNS provider. HostMonster is my current registrar / DNS provider / web host. I moved my home to Rackspace from HM a couple years ago, when HM was having e-mail issues. I thought they had their stuff together and was going to move back. The last 3 hours has been a prolonged convo with their brain dead tech support, so maybe I&#x27;ll just complete the move away from HM.
 I don&#x27;t need web hosting, just DNS. But I suspect web comes with package no matter what.

This is my first foray into corporate IT as I only started a few months ago. I passed my Linux+ today and I&#x27;m thinking about pivoting to the Linux team that they have at my company but I&#x27;m not sure if I should also get my RHCSA or RHCP as well? Im pretty familiar with both Windows and Linux but Id like to work with Linux in an actual professional environment.

                              <span>I&#x27;m tasked with finding a UPS solution for our company&#x27;s server rack. Adding up the servers&#x27; power consumption from what their PSUs are capable of I got to around 10kW. So this means with all servers at 100% load a minimum of 10kW is needed to supply enough power to keep the devices running. I figured, to be safe, I&#x27;d recommend getting UPS units totaling about 12kW to allow enough time for a graceful shutdown in case of a power outage.
 My coworker thinks this is overkill and he&#x27;d rather we get a UPS just big enough for our average daily load. It&#x27;d be more work to measure all our servers&#x27; power consumption but it&#x27;d save us money. He also believes we just need UPS to cover for power fluctuations and spikes.
 Is it feasible, if safe at all, to &quot;skimp&quot; on UPS like that? I&#x27;m not great at putting my thoughts on the table and my coworker has spent more time in the company than I did so if the answer to the previous question is no then I&#x27;ll need convincing arguments.

                              <span>Yes, there may be SOME features that VMWare still have that Proxmox VE doesn&#x27;t have (and features Proxmox VE has that VMWare never will, like built-in backups). But let me tell you, for my hypervisor in my home datacentre, I have continually had value in Proxmox VE in the 10 years I&#x27;ve been running and upgrading it.
 I started with Proxmox VE v2.3, 2x node cluster, which has expanded over time to 3x node cluster and upgraded over the literal decade to now v7.2-11. Same cluster, upgraded in-place. Earlier versions were a touch rocky to do major version upgrades on, but documentation was there, and I was able to get it sorted.
 Over the decade I&#x27;ve not only had performance improvements on the same hardware, but new features, and all sorts of great things. I update with some regularity (several times per year).
 I went to take a backup of my VM and found a feature suddenly there that I didn&#x27;t know I needed. &quot;Protected&quot;. I can take backups that don&#x27;t get auto-pruned by my backup task! SO AWESOME!
 Also, Proxmox VE gave me an HTML5 local console to my VMs months/years before VMWare even had it, and Proxmox VE did it so much better (so much more responsive).
 And these are just some examples.
 So, I gotta say, fuckin&#x27;eh to the Proxmox VE devs! I don&#x27;t know if you read this. But I tip my hat to all involved in the Proxmox VE development ecosystem. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys and gals. Anyone having any issues creating a Windows 11 Enterprise image for deployment? (yeah we still use actual images for some reason)
 We are currently prepping our first windows 11 image for rollout via Desktop Central and are having a ton of random issues.
 After deployment the OS will not open a ton of apps (no errors and no processes start) including settings, paint, ms store, notepad to name a few. This seems to be happening across any hardware we try it on. If I try to run settings via task manager I get an &#x27;this app is not installed&#x27; prompt. 
 I&#x27;ve ran SFC, DISM, with no errors found / no improvement. I can&#x27;t really get to much else to try to repair the install/apps either (settings is completely dead).
 It is worth noting that the current windows 11 version we have been testing with is Enterprise 22H2. We have tried fresh installs of 22H2, upgrading from windows 10 to windows 11 and running updates, as well as updating from 21H1 to 22H2. Due to the nature of the business/our security policy we can&#x27;t deploy anything below the latest MS patched device even if the latest version is unstable (yeah idk).
 Any ideas/comments?
 ​
 TLDR: Does Windows 11 Suck or do I just suck? inb4 both.

 Can you help with a template or pointers on how to notify a couple of users that their laptop is scheduled for replacement and that they should submit their old laptop? Next week i&#x27;ll be upgrading laptops for more than 30 users but most of the users have a tendency to want to bring in their old laptops when they feel like it -which frustrates me because there will be others tasks to do. I&#x27;m looking for something firm, and no-nonsense but still formal/polite email

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try to make this short. Started my career in IT last November when I started working as an IT field technician for a telecom company. Things were good at first but having to drive around didn&#x27;t cities to provide support for 30+ sites got old even though my schedule was pretty flexible with no one to directly report to in my immediate coverage area.
 Got tired of being away from home and felt like I also hit a ceiling as far as knowledge goes. The position focused very much on hardware over software and didn&#x27;t feel like I could further advance my career by staying at current company.
 Fast forward to November 1st this year. I started a new position with a different company that has more of a focus on Windows products ( Windows Server, Office products, etc). The previous IT guy they had at the company unfortunately passed away back in June from cancer. With that he also left no documentation whatsoever when it came to passwords, credentials, anything for that matter. 
 Now I&#x27;m dealing with a Windows Server that is currently running on an evaluation version because they were attacked by Ransomware back in September which caused them to restore their server without a license I guess? They are also using a combination of Google docs and Office 2016.
 I&#x27;ve already bright these items up to the CFO who is my direct report and I don&#x27;t think he understands the sense of urgency to have these items implemented

                              <span>Looking for some feedback, and thoughts on how to be better at my job. I&#x27;m an Architecture / Engineering manager, in prior lives I&#x27;ve been in development, ops, infrastructure, data center, all at the same company. It&#x27;s a really big environment, and I&#x27;ve gotten a reputation for understanding how most of it fits together.
 I&#x27;ve been a manager for about 3 years now, finally feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing, but mostly with a small team. I&#x27;m probably too hands on/ in the weeds, and I like to work on side projects still, but I get good feedback from my team, and boss/ peers. My team&#x27;s going to double in a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve been a bit worried about coming off as a know-it-all, or a micromanager to the new folks. I try to be cognizant of setting a goal and letting the team figure out the best way to get there, but I definitely have opinions about how we should be building things.
 So, I guess my question is how do you prefer to interact with your boss, when they&#x27;re not just the people manager? Do you like having them help figure things out, or would you rather they stay out of your way and let you come to them? Or those of you that are in this situation, how do you balance it?
 Hope that didn&#x27;t come across too self centered, thanks for the consideration

                              <span>I am trying to run my wsl2 ubuntu instance in MobaXterm, however I am seeing strange behavior.
 After a reboot when I try to mobaxterm, then run the wsl sessionI created, it shows a blank screen, then nothing. It may close on its own or show &quot; Network error: Connection refused&quot;. I tried changing the connection methods, none of them worked.
 The only thing that worked some times after a reboot is to delete the session, then rebuild it. Works perfectly again. But this does not work every time.
 What is this, a bug? Anyone else running into this?

                              <span>I have been struggling with a good short metaphor or description between the difference of, knowing what buttons to push to get an outcome, and understanding what those buttons do.
 Ie. Understanding the buttons to push to create a Microsoft team, and understanding each of the options truly, not just following instructions, and how best to use those options.
 Or
 Knowing that a reboot solves a problem, vs knowing WHY the reboot solves the problem.
 Any suggestions on a clearer and concise way of describing the difference?

                              <span>Hi,
 I’ve got an issue I run into every month with a specific server when patching. When shutting down after the monthly CU has been prepared the server sits at Getting Windows ready… for anything up to a couple of hours.
 This is the only Server that does this.
 It has the following roles 
 AD Domain Controller File Services inc. deduplication 
 The server is a hyper-v virtual machine
 When I open resource monitor on the hyper-v host I can see a lot of disk activity, but oddly it’s on the vhd that acts as the storage location for the file services on the server. 
 There is approx 4TB of data, all small files.
 Can anyone advise why the update process seems to be so interested in that location? Is this normal from others experience of large file servers?
 Any insights much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi!
 iam not sure if its matter where to start robocopy cmdlet.
 For example:
 Source: MS Fileserver
 Target: NetApp Volume
 Would it make a difference to start my robocopy job directly on the source server instead of an admin machine on the same network? When I start the job on my admin machine, would it be a additional hop (cache) for the files, so the copy would take longer?
 ​
 Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some level of understanding with Cisco Hyperflex. We will hopefully getting official training on it soon, but my team is being asked to take over a multi-site Hyperflex solution that was created by, well lets just call them non-IT people to be nice, and my first impression is that it wasn&#x27;t built right. But they insist they followed all the Cisco recommendations. So I have some questions I&#x27;m hoping to figure out before I get called at 3am on a Saturday.
 First, the way these systems are configured is there is 6 VMware hosts, all with 6 SSDs in them, then the 7th server is the Hyperflex management server or something. Each server has a single NIC with 2 ports, 25Gbit, connected to two different switches. Those NICs are handling anything Hyperflex, VMware DRS, VMware Management, storage, and VM traffic itself. 
 Questions:
 1 - I&#x27;ve always gone with the school of thought that 1 single dual port NIC isn&#x27;t very good for redundancy, but they insist this is the Cisco recommendation, are they really right?
 2 - I also would never shove everything through those two nics, is this also Cisco&#x27;s recommendation?
 3 - The storage in VMware looks like iSCSI, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get hands on. Where does the iSCSI adapters on the VMware host connect to as a SAN provider? Is it the management server? What happens when it crashes?
 4 - Is the Hyperflex storage like VSAN where there is a replication delay? if so, how long is that delay?
 5 - They told me DRS should be turned off for Hyperflex. Is that true? IF so, why?
 I guess open ended, is there any other tidbits of info you can supply me? Imagine that you are being asked to support a pair of these systems in different geographic locations, without ever seeing the damn thing ever.
 That&#x27;s me

                              <span>I have been handed a setup with a few ext HDDs with vhdx files that was used for a recovery on a hyper-v setup. 2 of the 3 ext HDDs I can mount the vhdx files, however the last one won&#x27;t mount and my suspicions are because the ext HDD is formatted at fat32. 
 The end users had access to the contents on this vhdx which was mounted on one of the VMs from this ext HDD. I just can&#x27;t see how that was possible considering hyper-v won&#x27;t even boot a VM with this vhdx added, regardless it can&#x27;t even be mounted to be explored.
 Is it possible to mount or attach a vhdx stored on a fat32 drive so we can explore the contents?

                              <span>Office 365 DOS Attack
 So this week we suddenly had a load of users who all needed their account unlocked. Upon investigation what had happened was we had external attempts of multiple logins to azure ad power shell that had failed and triggered the lockout policy.
 The attempts were clearly scripted as we had hundreds in a matter of seconds, all from different countries. The logins have since died down.
 I could find a conditional access policy to specifically block Azure AD power shell but found a post where you can block all apps then allow all the apps you use. This makes me nervous so currently have it in report only mode.
 This got me thinking how easy it would be for a malicious actor to do a DOS attack on a company which could cause a real outage and if there is a true way to protect against these attacks?
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a great opportunity to setup networking equipment for a small, gaming lounge. Current setup is using business ISP router/ap. 
 Budget: startup business, so $1000 USD range for initial install. 
 Devices: 3 Gaming PC&#x27;s (6 total in future) 3 Gaming Consoles (3+ more in future) 6+ smart TV&#x27;s (more in future) Security cameras 6-10 (currently none installed)
 Initial recommendation is ubiquiti (Dream machine pro, 48 port switch, AP&#x27;s, cameras)
 Want more recommendations - what&#x27;s your go to for this type of &quot;all in one&quot; appliances. There is no dedicated IT, possibly just me on weekends (lol).

 I&#x27;m trying to understand the http and if it does create a tcp connection for each request what I mean by request is a new page of the same domain (&#x27;google.com&#x27; and for google.com/X)
 ​
 I tried to see with wireshark if I get a new connection when I go through the hyperlinks,but I struggled to understand the behavior .When I click on some links with the same domain there is no tcp handshake but with others there is a handshake
 ​
 so when looking at the link I found that the ones that establish new tcp connection uses the rel attribute rel&#x3D;&quot;bookmark&quot; and I think that it is the src of this behavior can some explain if I&#x27;m in the correct path or I&#x27;m just doing some nonsense thanks for your response I&#x27;m still a noob so please bear with me

                              <span>Hey nice people out here
 IDk exactly if this question is off topic or not but making it simple , here it goes like : 
 My company is running Cisco anyconnect servers + OpenConnect servers on some specific URLs with load balancing and different managements which non of them is making me a problem other than the network my clients are sitting in and the problem is that :
 I have multiple clients sitting behind a firewall that doesn&#x27;t let them have access to OC/CA servers of that company on that specific port and URL but There is an other client(server) in this network that can pass this firewall without any problem and I can run my own domain on this client So the question will simply be what Kind of hardware or software do I need on that specific client to make a bridge into company&#x27;s servers without extra routing, encryption/decryption and SSL certification ? Is HAProxy capable of doing this ? Do i need Remote SSL offloading ? 
 ​
 In other terms : Something like a Proxy that takes OpenConnect/Cisco requests from clients on the inside network and just forwards them to original servers without regulation ? I want Clients to not change anything other than the URL 
 ​
 And there are reasons why I want this scenario to be unchanged so please understand that I&#x27;m not looking for better ways of doing something like this but rather making this work

                              <span>Does anyone know the part number of the rack mount kit for the Dell S4100F-ON series switches? I am not sure how it happened; but we have a couple switches with no rack mount setup and I would like to get them mounted.
 I have found install instructions and other technical data - but cannot seem to find the actual kits.
 Thanks!

We’re replacing some sonicwalls and even though on some level a firewall is a firewall there seem to be some significant differences in the fundamentals of how things are approached.

                              <span>We were switching out our 2901 router with a Fortigate firewall, all worked and had connectivity to all sites but we had one major problem. Our VOIP phones couldn’t get calls in or out. ISP says we have to have the router in place with the call manager, something with SIP trunk. I put the router back in and took out the fortigate. Looking to reconfigure the design, and the install the FG again. 
 I’m not a voice guy at all, like 0. What’s the best route here ? I was thinking out fortigate on edge and run FG &lt; router &lt; LAN.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Trying to see if we can get some feedback on a problem we are experiencing in a site we recently took on. We had this problem almost daily around September where all inbound traffic would stop while all of our VPN tunnels stay up to our other 2 sites. When this happens bandwidth at the firewall on our WNA interface and our LAN interface is both minimal, 4-5 mbps if now lower. The problem disappeared till it started again a few days ago. The ISP says something on our end is maxing out their AdTran 5660 CPU causing it to start discarding packets. I feel like I should be able to see a spike on our firewall in traffic if we are in essence almost DOSing their router. We have mostly used Cisco Meraki and Fortinet in the past so Juniper is not our strong suit but from what I can tell they seem to be setup correctly to handle broadcast storms etc., but I could be missing something. Any suggestions on where I should start looking? 
 ​
 Some background on the site:
 Fortigate 400E firewall (handling DHCP)
 Juniper EX4600 Core fiber switch 
 Mix of EX 3400 and EX2300 switches throughout the site (around 25)
 Previous admins have the site setup flat with one large subnet (/20)
 Major things running on network are around 200 Hikvision cameras and 10 or so DVRS, around 100ish IP based clocks/speakers in rooms. 
 Site is running Ruckus APs and Zone Controller.

 I have a PPTP client.
 Now all LAN data go through the PPTP client.
 I want to redirect the fixed address list to direct wan and the rest of the data will go through VPN.
 How can I do that?

                              <span>Hi Everyone! 
 We encountered an issue where a customer was attempting to run an RFC 2544 test along a circuit we provide. The circuit will pass on all tests except for the small MTU sizes of 64 and 256. We see a drop in line rate on the throughput tests to about 750Mbps for 64 byte and 820Mbps for 256 byte.
 We are using the ASR 900 and ASR 920 routers for each end of this circuit. It’s a L2VPN point-to-point circuit designated at 1Gbps. 
 Has anyone else had any luck getting their RFC 2544 tests to pass with these routers at the lower MTU sizes? It seems like there could be a CPU limitation preventing these smaller sizes from achieving line rate throughput.
 Thanks for any help!

I&#x27;m having trouble getting the Meraki online, it states ethernet connect to local network &quot;Static Frame-Route IP&quot;. However, I can&#x27;t connect to the Meraki dashboard. For now I will set that problem aside as I foresee a larger problem. We have another partner that has their own appliance and must be completely separate from us physically. Before we had a switch that would split that connection and let them pull down their public IP, the problem is I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s going to work in a leased line situation where they typically have a /32 for the PPPoE connection?

 ​
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted in on-prem DC?
 ​
 So, as we know, traffic in CDN networks is mostly outbound and the ratio can be 1:99, where only 1% are requests from the Internet to the CDN, and 99% are responses from the CDN to the Internet. On the one hand, we are obliged to use a firewall and requests from the Internet to the CDN service must pass through it. But should the return traffic go through the firewall? For example it might be possible that traffic from the Internet is only 1 Gbit/s, while outgoing traffic can reach hundreds of Gbit/s and it seems unreasonable to use firewall for outgoing traffic, because we trust our servers, plus we need a more expensive firewall. But on the other hand, if the return traffic won&#x27;t pass through the firewall, the routing setup will be a bit tricky, plus we&#x27;ll get asymmetric routing and so on...
 ​
 So, again:

But I&#x27;m curious how well-staffed employers handle having redundancy and making sure things aren&#x27;t a disaster waiting to happen. Do you write down every regular task you do, so that even a total novice could use your notes to keep the place going?

 Since this is a isolated test box, I was hoping to use the loopback ip for my fqdn. I guess there is some external dns checks????
 I guess the question is how can I test without creating external dns records, etc.

All the proper Office 365 licensing was purchased, the message encryption functionality works perfectly on a stand alone office workstation. No issues with OWA.
 But the client wants the encrypt email functionality on their RDS server, where they all primarily work, working with the Outlook app directly. 
 Three different things occur depending upon how you click the Encrypt button in Outlook, when composing a new message:

 The core Network guy is too new and swamped with lots of work and I have a vendor which manages the firewalls but I need to get quickly across firewalls , site to site vpns , NAT in palos in that order and maybe some azure express routes too. 
 have the basic understanding but need to get a little deeper into it 
 Anyone here able to provide a 101 type video on the topic from say YouTube or tutorial/how to articles on the topic. Also there should be a trial Palo VE edition I could setup in my lab too am guessing. 
 Muchas Gracias!

                              <span>We are seeing an issue with client explorer.exe processes leaking handles on our SMB servers and causing them to be overrun.
 Within a few hours of opening a session in some cases we can see handle count for explorer.exe reaching 250,000+.
 Seeing it on mostly Windows 10 but also Server 2012 R2.
 When I run handle.exe tool it just has like 200,000 entries all in the root of the share and this is often without any applications running or files being opened (i.e. the share is just mapped/user has opened a connection to it at some point)
 Thought it might be AV or Windows Updates but have temporarily disabled AV and installed latest patches but problem still occurs.
 Not sure how to investigate why explorer is just continuously opening these handles and then proceeding to not close them/letting them just pile up. Thought it was a server issue but this is happening across multiple different SMB servers/independent storage systems.

                              <span>Today I upgraded a JIRA app called BigPicture on our productive environment. I&#x27;m not a professional JIRA admin, but I do 1st and 2nd Level Support aside from my main tasks.
 The company paid around 6500 $ for the license for that app.
 By default, the app creates a database dump whenever you upgrade it.
 Cool, I thought. Upgraded it with few clicks. Closed the ticket – went on with my day thinking that it worked out fine. Nope. I received an E-Mail that the entire configuration from the users was gone.
 I looked into it and, yes, all the things that they were working on were gone. Communicated the situation to my other admin colleague and to the key users. Then I tried restoring the data from the database dump. This did not work because the database scheme has been upgraded as well, and we would have to revert the app to the older version to make the restore file compatible.
 So, I went into test environment, downloaded the older version of said app, installed it, but no. It did not downgrade. Apparently you&#x27;d have to uninstall the app first and then reinstall the older version. Sure thing, so I did just that (on the test environment) and tried to restore the backup there. Failed. Nothing happened when I click on the button to restore the data. And I also cannot restore the data on the test environment as the database dump only applies to the prod environment (due to the upgrade).
 Note that this is not the first time that this happened. We&#x27;ve had the same issue with this app around 1 month ago, where I created a ticket. Apparently it was a bug, which then got hotfixed. (We even tested it and it worked). But now we are back to where we&#x27;ve been in the beginning. I reopened the ticket, and I&#x27;m still waiting for feedback.
 Got a message that this issue has been perceived very negatively, and I understand. Now they want me to get the app working ASAP or I might get fired, but there&#x27;s not much I can do.
 Yikes.

                              <span>I am looking for a software where I will be able to document IT SOPs, enviroments, workstations, printers, switches, firewalls, accesspoints, IPAMS, CMDBS, user applications/software. 
 Some good tool for keeping track of everything i have my pipeline as i tend to be unorganized and forgetful unless I have good documentation. 
 This is purley for personal use to gain an upper edge in my role as infrastructure/application manager. 
 I don&#x27;t mind having to host and /or set ut a lot of it on my own part. I find that enjoyable. 
 ​
 WIll be greatful for all suggestions, just started looking into it, but I thought i would throw out the question to see if anyone had some suggestions on the top of their mid.

                              <span>How do you all name your domain (cloud or prem) PCs? 
 I use asset tags and am considering just naming computers by serial. I wholly manage a hybrid Azure enviro w/2k machines and 45 servers and I’m tired of buying asset tags only to deal with them being peeled off or falling off. 
 My asset system is easy to manage and assign to users/facilities via asset tags, but it’s all the same to me how they’re named since I can find them and their primary users through many pipelines. 
 Hybrid Azure w/SCCM co-manage, all windows workstations, servers are all on ESXi hosts. Hosts, arrays, and network switches have the same asset identity schema.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Earlier this year I shared an OpenSSL cheat sheet and it seems to have been received well by this community. I&#x27;ve made a few typo corrections and wanted to share the latest version.
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; OpenSSL Cheat Sheet v1.7 Direct Download &lt;&#x3D;&#x3D;
 The cheat sheet includes these commands and various flags/arguments and notes for how to use them:
  
openssl rsa
 openssl genrsa
 openssl dsa
 openssl gendsa
 openssl dsaparam
 openssl ec
 openssl ecparam
 openssl pkey
 openssl genpkey
 openssl x509
 openssl req
 openssl pkcs12
  
The most up to date version of this cheat sheet will always be available at pracnet.net/openssl, at the moment that is v1.7, so feel free to use the direct download link above. (no registration or e-mail sign ups required)
 The cheat sheet is a part of a course I teach on OpenSSL, and if you use OpenSSL for troubleshooting and inspecting SSL/TLS, you might want to consider the whole course. Since it&#x27;s coming up on sale season I figured I&#x27;d also throw in 1000 free seats to the course on Udemy:
 Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/openssl-cheatsheet/?couponCode&#x3D;B7B7EEF874F9D43D1AB5
 Udemy Code: B7B7EEF874F9D43D1AB5

                              <span>Until recently we had users running RDP sessions on a Windows 2012r2 server, and were able to shadow their sessions without issues.
 We now run Windows server 2022 RDS session host, and shadowing shows black screen with only user mouse showing. I understand this problem started with server 2016. Any suggestions as to what can be done on the server-side to fix this issue?

                              <span>Evening fellow SysAdmins. We have been a long time GWorkspace customer and have been pretty happy overall. We now have to begin expanding our email retention and archiving requirements. Google has Vault with unlimited space and retrieval options for an add on. I&#x27;ve read pros/cons using Vault, compared to another 3rd party service, especially in how it performs and for lack of some features. It seems so much easier to get Vault and administer from the same &quot;Dashboard&quot; though rather than another service pooling all our email and using a side vendor. I was hoping follow members, either uses a service that works with Gmail very well, or their direct Vault product and what their take is on it. Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I don’t know how others feel about this but I have gotten to the point that I get pissed off when friends or acquaintances ask me for IT help. I don’t want to do IT when I’m off the clock from my job. I feel like we work in one of the few professions in which people think they can just reach out to us for a free fix. I don’t ask people for free haircuts or to come clean my house for free. Why do they think they can just call or text me with their IT problem and expect me to give them an answer? I paid money and spent a lot of time to get my certs and education. My solution to this has been to tell people, “sure, I can take a look at that. My diagnosis fee is $50. I can’t guarantee I can fix it but I will take a look and we can go from there.” I actually just got my first client like this. It was meant as more of a deterrent but I got a client. Lol. Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to see what others think.

                              <span>A little background I&#x27;m in my mid 30s had a pretty bad burnout and am now in a 6 month IT course (IT security).
 I&#x27;m pretty much ahead of my class due to having been an IT nerd all my life.
 My question is, do managers/companies/colleagues care more about your knowledge or your ability to get stuff up and running.
 Tldr: Should i focus my spare time during these classes on focusing on theoretical information or actually do stuff and get it running.
 For eg we have a little project where we have to setup an AD environment. It&#x27;s really basic so for fun Ive virtualized everything in proxmox, got a virtual opnsense router in there, adding a backup and monitoring server, looking to get it liked to azure somehow ...

                              <span>A user submitted a ticket stating that they need access to a website. They continue on (in the ticket) to say that they have already requested access to this site, months ago, and nobody helped them. In today&#x27;s ticket, they did not include the domain they needed access to.
 I looked at the ticket history and sure enough, they did submit a ticket months ago. That ticket did include a domain and at that time the tech notes on the ticket were.
  
The domain resolves and opens on a few computers that I&#x27;ve confirmed access on. Please confirm that you&#x27;ve typed the domain name/website name properly. I am keeping the ticket open for a few days, please let me know when you are available to perform further testing from your machine/location.
  
The status on the ticket was changed to &#x27;waiting for user response&#x27;, which keeps the ticket open and informs the user at least once a day that a ticket requires their attention. It does this for 5 business days then closes the ticket if there is no reply from the user or if the tech doesn&#x27;t modify the ticket in some other way.
 The user ignored the notes from the first ticket that &#x27;they put in months ago&#x27; and I&#x27;m sure this user is bad mouthing IT. &#x27;I can&#x27;t get to this site, this is dumb, I already put in a ticket, they never help me!!!&#x27;

Yet I&#x27;ve noticed several NTP errors in event logs starting on the 15th for time.windows.com. Apparently the backup NTP peer after the domain controller is time.windows.com, and when I run w32tm /stripchart /computer:time.windows.com /dataonly /samples:10 I notice that it&#x27;s erroring out a lot (70% error rate). Anyone else?

 I moved and have worked for a private company for a year and I am still shocked by how different things are, lack of documentation, lack of planning, lack of contracts etc etc
 At the factory there seems to be so many production stops due to ancient hardware, and sadly we in IT are involved too because some of that hardware, e.g. weights are connected to servers and computers too. At a meeting where we were in…</span>

 example.com is the public domain, ad.example.com is the internal-only domain. Lookups to records under ad.example.com will succeed against the internal Samba domain controllers will succeed but will fail against public DNS servers.
 As we can see, a lookup for rt.example.com returns the CNAME, but then doesn&#x27;t &quot;follow up&quot; to get the IP address, even though a lookup for rt73a.ad.example.com returns the IP address.
 The context is that I currently don&#x27;t want rt.example.com to be accessible over the internet but I might want that in future. Was hoping to be able to that without requiring a change of URL used to access it.
 Is DNS supposed to behave how it&#x27;s behaving for me, or is there some setting I need to change to get the behaviour I want?

Just thought I&#x27;d make a new post to see if the update DID resolve the Kerberos issues for anyone that rolled the update out and removed their original registry edits. Us gunshy sysadmins with no test environment thank you regardless.

 Now because of print nightmare we are trying a work around to install the printer drivers via intune and then a login script to map the printers after the drivers are installed.
 Here comes the issue, we have noticed that all of the printers with v4 drivers are being installed with MS point and print driver. The printer with v3 drivers are installing with their appropriate drivers.
 We have found that some of the V4 drivers are not installing, so adding that to the driver install script, removing and re-running the login mapping script, it still adds the printers with point and print. 2 of these are for the main office and need user preferences enabled so they can select trays etc. But point and print doesn&#x27;t enable that. Without that we cannot shut off the old DCs.
 Now we don&#x27;t want to disable the print nightmare registry key or amend it to a state where it is not 1 as this will be picked up in the cyber security audit in March 2023. I am at a loss as to what I can do to bypass this issue. It seems odd that all websites on the Internet state V4 is the answer to fixing it but V4 is causing the problem.
 At the moment we cannot move to a driverless system as we need to get new printer contracts first.
 TLDR; printers with V4 drivers are shown installed with point and print and is not suitable for our environment.

                              <span>I am in IT for a Navy Organization and we currently use AppLocker in our environment. AppLocker is set to block anything to do with OneDrive, however it keeps getting reinstalled during every monthly patch. As far as I know, its not a requirement for any other apps and we have already been blocking it for a few month. 
 What this ends up doing is making is users constantly see &quot;blocked by admin&quot; and error messages. This does not effect functionality but it causes an uproar from users.
 My suggested solution is to disable OneDrive usage via Group policy but actually &quot;allow OneDrive&quot; via AppLocker to prevent these messages. 
 Is there anything Security/STIG related that makes my idea sound like a bad one? For reference this is the policy I want to enable.
 https://admx.help/?Category&#x3D;Windows_10_2016&amp;Policy&#x3D;Microsoft.Policies.OneDrive::PreventOnedriveFileSync
 Any and all input would be great regarding your organization, file storage, or just security guidelines in general. I do have the OneDrive V2R2 STIGS as well. But I wasn&#x27;t sure if there are any other overarching guidelines I am missing out on.

                              <span>I have a few servers (2016 and 2019) that the start menu doesn&#x27;t work on.
 If I run:
  
Get-appxpackage -all shellexperience -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
  
The start menu will work after reboot until you log off and log back on. 
 I have tried running various powershell commands to uninstall then reinstall appx packages, copying over the SystemApps folder from a working server, deleting the shell experience folder from appdata for all users, exporting appx registry keys from a working server, and deleting and recreating profiles.
 The only thing that works is the command listed above, and that&#x27;s only temporary. 
 I&#x27;d appreciate any ideas on this one, I think I&#x27;ve exhausted google.

 We notice that when phishing emails do slip through Mimecast’s net, in some cases these are categorising as phishing by Microsoft Defender. Because of this we have made the decision to turn on Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (Exchange Online Protection) policies for an additional layer of security.

 One of my clients has an old infrastructure (Server 2012) and they want to go serverless (AADJ + Intune) as much as possible and migrate most of his data into SharePoint but there are SolidWorks files that still need to stay on-prem and I am wondering if need to keep the file server and upgrade it?
 If a windows server is still required for SolidWorks, I also need a dc for authentication, right? I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep the DC...Do you guys have any tips or recommendation for that kind of scenario?
 Thank you very much for the help !

 Does anyone have any ideas on what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m not versed in the ways of the sysadmin but i have to work with daily users fixing little and larger stuff (Helpdesk).
 I like my job but i don&#x27;t know what to do anymore for a specific individual. 
 This person is paranoid, delusional and thinks the entire world is following her and changing stuff behind her back.
 It started years ago, she claimed her skype account got hacked multiple times, she couldn&#x27;t reset the password since she never got the reset mails.
 Turns out her recovery address was a gmail address and she never cleaned that up so the mailbox was full.
 She doesn&#x27;t want to clean it up so she can never reset any service she claims has been blocked or hacked that is connected to her gmail address.
 This person does not accept nor want to hear any rational explanation.
 She claims all her phones, laptops (private and work) are being monitored and things &quot;change&quot; the next time she logs on to any device.
 For years we ran scans with antivirus, antimalwares etc ... nothing is ever found except some harmless cookies.
 We can never verify if anything she claims is true since the &quot;present situation&quot; cannot be compared to the &quot;previous situation&quot; since all files are always locally on her laptop or at home or anywhere else where we have no backups.
 Finally we got her to place some documents on our internal network drives with the specific question to only follow what happens to these files while she works on them. (She really didn&#x27;t want to put them on the network) This way at least i can look into the backups to see what has changed. But even that doesn&#x27;t prove anything.
 What would you do so you could &quot;prove&quot; that either she changed something or at least see what changed and by whom ?
 This person can tie you up for hours and days complaining we don&#x27;t do enough to find the culprit on her work pc and i don&#x27;t know anymore what i could do to help her.
 ​
 Cheers,

                              <span>Hi All
 Further to my post about using Azure/365 non licensed users. I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.
 A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.
 Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).
 I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at other threads on here about other VPN hardware providers and I&#x27;ve heard a general concensus of Cisco anyconnect and Palo&#x27;s global protect. As being great options 
 There&#x27;s only a few concerns/requirements I&#x27;m looking for.
  
Pre-windows login auth to domain servers for new user authentication
 Saved credentials that can be used with said pre-windows login
 And multiple gateway options for fail over to redundant ISPs
  
For requirement #1,2 we have a few branch offices with a decent amount of turn over so new users are always signing in and out of the domain&#x27;d pc so a saved set of VPN credentials that user&#x27;s can&#x27;t see and don&#x27;t need to be reentered for an employee to authenticate to the DC to is a must
 We currently use Watchguard fireboxes with IPsec clients as they allow prelogin auth with saved creditials, but my only gripe is that the VPN client doesn&#x27;t allow for multiple gateway options with out making a new profile, that users have to swap to and sign in again on. (The VPN client has to swap gateways on its own as I don&#x27;t trust my users to toggle to the back up, and to toggle back to the primary when connection is stable again.) 
 I&#x27;m hesitant at the Cisco option as I don&#x27;t have much Cisco CLI expertise.
 We have about 25-35 VPN endpoints at any given time. 
 We are a full windows org and only IT uses VPN on phones (mainly to just test if the VPN connection is working)

 Today we updated all of our Konica Minolta print drivers to v4 and non-admin users can install printers without admin permissions.
 Is it really this simple?! We have been fighting with this issue since PrintNightmare hit last year.

                              <span>Task &#x3D; migrate all users (8000+) homedrive data to onedrive but replicate the myDocuments structure(home drives vary from 1gb up to 30gb) 
 I have found that i need to identify and exclude any onedrive shortcuts in all users onedrives as well as:
 1 prevent them being moved via robocopy (we are lifting and shifting all onedrive content into a &quot;documents&quot; folder for each user)
 2 prevent any files being moved from users homedrives going in to any onedrive shortcuts folders, this is to prevent personal files being uploaded to SP or a Teams SP site. (Happened in testing...)
 Currently I have a robocopy to do a move (it&#x27;s more complex than this example) :
 Onedrive root -&gt; Onedrive\Documents Hdrive -&gt; onedrive\Documents
 Issue being folders are merged and onedrive shortcuts will upload content to whatever sites they are part of.
 This is a task set out as we can not use the provided onedrive migration tools due to some clash with known folder redirection and pther issues that i wasnt part of initially. 
 Any ideas? Or am I over complicating things.
 I have created a complicated powershell script so far that does alot of prechecks (network,diskspace,homedrive space required, etc) but this actual lift and shift part just gets more complicated when I look into the nitty grity bits.

                              <span>Hi, i’m an italian IT admin for some different companies, i started my business 1 year ago and i have 5 year of experience in the IT administration field (i started almost from zero and during my engineer graduation i worked a lot in this field). Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider. Thanks in advice

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m newbie with windows server. 
 When we install the printer in the server, it does not auto install on computers inside the domain. 
 I created a policy which is called Print Nightmare, but it did not work and I needed to seach it by myself. 
 Other problem that happened is that if I installed the printer first in one user the error 0x000002e4 comes up, but if I login with Admin and install it, and then login with the user and install it, there is no error. 
 Is anyway that I can install in the server and automaticly the printer shows up by itself ? 
 I do not know if I explained it well.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I want to test my Samsung SATA drives since some of them cause trouble when recording large video files over time, causing drop frames. Seems to be due to the SSD not being able to keep up the pace. I know the usual suspects like Samsung Macigian, Crystal Disk, Smartmontools, etc. 
 But it seems none of them gives me a comfortable way of dealing with slowly degrading disks of different types and vendors. Do I really have to go into the specific SMART attributes and check on the significance of each one of them, also having to monitor them changing over time? 
 For ex. my not so good old 840 Pro (256GB) passes all tests and currently gives me 56 CRC errors and 5216 wear leveling count. I also suspect that any kind of bad sector checks also don&#x27;t really work with SSDs as they trim the bad cells away!?

 I&#x27;m also not really an Elon hater but seeing him disregard his employees after the take over (firing indescriminately, forcing long hours, reverting work from home and now that ultimatum his mailed out) I can&#x27;t help but smile a little with the chaos that&#x27;s ensuing. It reminds me of all the bullshit finance, HR and sales have put us through in past projects without repercussions.

                              <span>Hello. I’m looking to figure out an oversubscription model for our WAN locations. We have many branch locations that are fed by MPLS services with no current option to add local internet access. Our wireless is centralized and we have no appetite at this time to change to flex-connect. 
 So, knowing this, I’ve landed on a minimum bandwidth of approx 3.5Mbps per client. I haven’t nailed down the amount of clients yet but I have a method to figure that out. What I’m struggling with is how much oversubscription to go with. 2:1, 5:1, 20:1? Or any other insights you may have. This is a healthcare environment, so a large portion of our guests are transitory, but while they’re here we want a good experience. 
 Thoughts? Totally to open to suggestions. 
 Edit: sorry for spelling, grammar. Mobile sucks. :)

                              <span>Hi all!
 it is some kind of a theoretical unequal-cost load-balancing question.
 Let&#x27;s imagine that we have two parallel connections between two routers 400M and 700M, or any unequal M:N ratio.
 What we have now for load both connections M:N ratio (let&#x27;s forget about Mice and Elephant flows).
 E.g. if we have Cisco from both sides - we have an proprietary EIGRP for this, which does an excellent job with this.
 So question - what if we have two different vendors on different sides (or one non-Cisco)? 
 What options do we have? BGP + DMZ Bandwidth Community? Static M:N routes? Do we have another non-Cisco proprietary solution for this?
 Is there anything else?
 I will be glad for detailed answers with explanations, Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Good afternoon,
 I work Helpdesk for a printer company and had an interesting situation that seems to be network related.
 The printer had a static IP, .0.24. I enabled DHCP, rebooted and it grabbed a 0.250 address (no APIPA). Also confirmed they were on the same Wi-Fi as the computer. The IP would not respond to pings and the UI was not reachable but the IP could be seen in an arp -a command. The MAC matched the printer. Typically, if you cannot ping it’s either on a different network or offline completely, and with this being visible in arp, a good Wi-Fi connection status and the printer rebooted, the only thing I could think would be to reboot the router. Any thoughts on what could cause this?
 Thanks very much!

 You&#x27;ll need the provisioning info from RingCentral. I found it under Phone System, Phones &amp; Devices, User Phones. Clicked one of the devices, clicked Set Up and Provision, then clicked Set up manually using SIP. Pick the correct outbound proxy based on your location.
 At this point, you need to decide whether to use TLS or not. It&#x27;s your choice but I recommend using it. The instructions below work for both. Copy all the information down because it contains information you&#x27;ll use below.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m a SrNE for a global biotech company and we&#x27;ve been running approximately ~2k+ C9300s spanning the globe for a few years now. Over the last 3 months we&#x27;ve been experiencing complete failures at a very alarming rate. We&#x27;re currently running IOS-XE v17.3.5.
 Switch failures have occurred for various reasons, entailing:
 - PoE capability of switch death (Non PSU related).
 - Switches experiencing faulty boot flash requiring more RMAs.
 - Switches randomly bricking with no lights whatsoever. Just a complete and total death.
 - Switches randomly bricking and giving &quot;BOOT FAIL W&quot; error on console and non-recoverable. Can&#x27;t even access ROMMON. Validated via Cisco bugID CSCwb57624, but not recoverable via power cycle/reload as noted in Workaround: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb57624
 Further, after our team pushed Cisco to how unacceptable this has been, they came back acknowledging a potentially faulty batch of many of our C9300s with corrupted DIMM.
 Guys... In my 15+ years of networking and having managed C3750/3850s for the majority of my career, I&#x27;ve never experienced or witnessed anything like this from Cisco.
 For years now, I haven&#x27;t been fond of the direction Cisco has taken their Catalyst platform with moves like axing Catalyst IOS, consolidating IOS-XE to catalyst hardware, and their continued merakification of Catalyst which lacks the tight integration needed for rock-solid stability (IMO). 
 Cisco&#x27;s moves have mostly felt more like cost-cutting measures than anything truly beneficial or innovative from an engineering standpoint. It&#x27;s all giving me FirePower vibes which is why Palo is now dominating that market-space.
 Anyone else running C9300s in their environment at scale?
 Any failures?
 What software chain?
 I can&#x27;t imagine our org is the only one experiencing this.

                              <span>When adding VLAN to switches, do you have to provide an IP address for the VLAN? Or is that only if you need to access the switch over that IP?
 ​
 In other words, can you just add the VLAN and assign the ports without assigning an IP? 
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We are currently using a NAC product that&#x27;s pretty expensive. We are using it to dynamic tag VLANs based on Active Directory OU. So, if the user is in the &quot;Monkeys&quot; OU they get assigned to the &quot;Monkeys&quot; VLAN.
 Can this be done with something like NPS or FreeRadius? I&#x27;ve been checking documentation and I&#x27;m getting mixed signals on how easy this would be to configure with FreeRadius (seems like it doesn&#x27;t play well with AD, requires Samba, etc.) and I have no experience with NPS, but the documentation seems pretty straightforward.
 Any recommendations on how to dynamically wireless users to specific VLANs via AD group/OU without paying out the ass for a NAC?

                              <span>Quick background first - Got about 10 years of professional networking experience but I have NEVER touched proper enterprise grade cisco equipment. EVER. Mostly worked in places that couldn&#x27;t afford or didn&#x27;t need all those features and a new ISP that did a Juniper/Calix combo. FINALLY started working for an employer that has the scratch for Cisco with Palo Alto for Firewall.
 TL;DR: I&#x27;m very green on what Cisco hardware can and cannot do.
 We are getting tasked with stopping users from being able to communicate directly with each other within their same subnets. They only need to communicate with specific servers and cloud services.
 With Calix, I was able to use a protocol called Mac Forced Forwarding (MFF). In conjunction with DHCP Snooping and IP Source Verification, the switches forced all traffic to the gateway where a host was assigned via DHCP. My original thought was to use this and have the PaloAlto&#x27;s regulate this traffic. Well to my surprise, these catalyst switches (9200, 9300 and 2960) do not have this feature. Seems to be limited to ISP grade switches.
 I tried using Switchport Protection (Private VLAN Edge) and this worked when the workstation where on the same switch. But it allows me to communicate to other workstations on other switches. While all of my access switches do trunk back 1-to-1 to the core switches. If I put those switch&#x27;s uplinks into protected status as well, I might get what I need. Still &quot;testing&quot; this out. 
 I&#x27;m also looking at VACLs but I haven&#x27;t fully grasped the cisco mapping features yet.
 Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to tackle this requirement?

 Setup
 Firewall &gt;&gt; 1820-8g &gt;&gt; WiFi AP
 My WiFi AP has 2 SSID (VLAN 1 and VLAN 1003). All I want to do is be able to pass through both on one port to firewall but all tagged traffic is currently blocked.
 I think what I need to do is set all ports as Untagged for VLAN ID 1 and Tagged for VLAN ID 1003? This seems weird since I don&#x27;t want to &quot;tag&quot; incoming traffic I just want it to pass through if already tagged. Is my understanding correct or should both VLAN ID be shown as Tagged?

                              <span>I have inherited a network where we have a single peering with an ISP using a private AS on our side. We advertise a single prefix (which we own) to them which they then advertise to the internet on our behalf.
 In RIPE, there is an empty ROA configuration where it shows the current AS numbers advertising the prefix (i.e. the ISPs AS) and we can just pick one and click to create an ROA to match. Private AS numbers do not show up here and cannot be configured as origins.
 I recently added an ROA to try and reduce the risk of a BGP hijack of our prefix. Shortly after creating the ROA, the ISP stopped accepting our prefix and of course it dropped off the internet. The ISP wasn&#x27;t able to give much information as to why this happened but by removing the ROA, it came back up soon after.
 I&#x27;m assuming what happened is, the ISP had a filter on their router which looked up the ROA for our advertised prefix, saw it originating from a private AS which didn&#x27;t match the ROA and then dropped it. Would that be normal behavior for an ISP? Would they not trust the private AS as they were the ones who provided it to us in the first place?
 Or is using an ROA just not possible where the originating AS is a private one?
 We do have a public AS that was recently assigned but have not started using it just yet.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and a lot of times when we are spinning up a new site, ISPs will provide a /30 for the WAN and then a LAN subnet (usually /27 or something similar) for public IPs to be assigned. Is there a reasoning for this rather than just including the ISP gateway in the provided public IPs? We usually have a firewall at the edge but when provided with this ISP set up, we have to use a router to bridge the WAN and LAN. Just wondering if there is any reason behind this configuration?

                              <span>Context:
 I&#x27;m a software engineer who came from a non software background and am in that &quot;holy shit, computers and the internet are amazing, let&#x27;s understand how the world works phase.&quot; I work for an awesome company that has networking problems and even though I don&#x27;t work on that part, I do want to understand it thoroughly.
 Anyways, I am looking a for a book that&#x27;s basically self contained/will give me enough information that I can read it and say &quot;ok, I know how this works and can sort of make a mental model of it in my head.&quot; I tend to read books cover to cover/work through as many problems as I can along the way.Ideally I&#x27;ll only need one book.
 Current recommendations/on my list are
 - Comer, Internetworking
 - Tannenbaum&#x27;s Networking textbook - Networking a top down approach
 Thanks in advance for your advice

But I&#x27;d like to hear opinions and stories from fellow network professionals about what they&#x27;ve experienced during their careers as far as RIFs/layoffs go. Especially with the large RIFs big tech companies are going through.

                              <span>Hi,
 Was wondering if anyone on this forum could shed a light on a strange issue I&#x27;m seeing on a network. 
 I have a VRF (all configured correctly as reachability to other subnet across the MPLS are reachable fine) presented on a port facing a host (windows laptop) the IP facing this host is:
 192.168.0.1/24 
 The host laptop is on:
 192.168.0.2/24
 I can ping the laptop fine sourcing the gateway interface on the router and the host can ping the gateway, however it is unable to ping other hosts inside the VRF on other sites (the laptop can ping the gateway to these other sites just nothing sat behind the gateway). 
 To remove any possibility of it being an MPLS issue I created a loopback interface on the router where the above 192.168.0.0/24 subnet sits: 
 Loopback100
 10.10.10.10/32 
 I still cannot ping the host 192.168.0.5 sourcing this loopback. I instantly assumed the host default gateway was wrong as I could ping directly connected but no further, however the hosts address/subnet mask and default gateway are 100% correct.
 ​
 Was wondering if anyone had a similar issue, the router is question is a Cisco ISR 1100.

                              <span>Hey!
 I am working as an MSP for Small Businesses (&lt;10 employees). None of our Customers have Services that are available through port forwarding nor do they use VPN connections. They have a proper professional Endpoint Security Solution (with Firewall) installed on every device.
 Now to my question: Does it make sense to deploy a &quot;Next-Gen Firewall&quot; into their network? I don&#x27;t really see any benefit they would get out of an expensive Firewall compared to say a small MikroTik Router doing NAT (properly configured of course, VLANS etc.) . I heard that all those fancy things like Deep Packet inspection come with their own Downsides that i would rather not deal with. (And my Endpoint Security Solution supposedly does the same thing but right on every device with little to no configuration)
 Do you think the added Security weighs out the cost of buying, monitoring and maintaining a Firewall for such a business?
 I personally would think the money is better spent on awareness trainings for the employees than on such a device. 
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Hi, as the question states, does anyone know if Teams tags it traffic with the correct QoS tags before it reaches the network port or access point?
 If not then does anyone have any suggestions how to identify the traffic across a multi vender OS estate? I would&#x27;ve considered a GPO to tag it with the correct tag if it was an all Windows estate but since MAC and Android are involved to, I was hoping Teams already pre tagged in traffic.
 We use Meraki MR46 access points and there is no option to build a custom rule based on source ip address annoyingly to as I know Teams has a predefined source port range it uses across the board
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking at implementing wireless QOS across our wireless estate.
 With this mainly comes the need to prioritise Microsoft Teams traffic over anything else first and foremost.
 I have read a few Meraki and 3rd party posts/blogs on setting it up with no real answer to this question...
 Do the default rules (or custom ones for that matter) shape traffic themselves on the AP&#x27;s or are they only a means of tagging certain traffic with the correct QoS tag?
 The reason I think the AP&#x27;s might arrange traffic and shape it themselves is because the option to &quot;Shape this traffic&quot; is there on the default and custom rules to.
 I haven&#x27;t really been able to find an answer to this.
 Our link speed bandwidth across this new site we are building is more than enough! But since there are going to be a lot of people wirelessly &quot;hot desking&quot;, wireless will be even more prioritised than wired. With that comes a need to make sure all the AP&#x27;s prioritise traffic such as Teams (mainly) etc... over others like YouTube etc... 
 If the default rules do shape traffic on the AP&#x27;s into low/high priority queues behind the scenes then they will be enough for what I&#x27;m looking for here given that the default tags from Meraki seem to be correct across the board for things like VOIP and Teams etc...

                              <span>Anyone else or just me? The amount of trouble and drama that these cause me is unreal at times. Absolutely hate the things!
 In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!
 We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4&#x27;s, 220Xi4&#x27;s, ZD500&#x27;s and ZT610&#x27;s. 
 A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn&#x27;t being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. 
 So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don&#x27;t really want to know. I&#x27;d sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!
 Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I&#x27;m an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn&#x27;t half stress me out when these things go down.
 It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result. I also find printers the most mundane sort of things to be dealing with which I suppose doesn&#x27;t help!

                              <span>Like the question stated in the subject, who&#x27;s job is it to retrieve company equipment from terminated employees in the remote workforce? My HR Dept is tasking me with reaching out to the termed employee and coordinating the return of equipment. I dont feel like it should be IT&#x27;s responsibility. I do believe that I should provide the list of equipment but not be the means of recovering it. I am curious on everyone&#x27;s thoughts and what procedures you all might have in place for this.
 Edit: I would like to thank everyone for your feedback. A little more background here, small IT Dept, I am a lone Sysadmin with one tech support rep. We have a company of about 225 employees and I report directly to the COO. I posted here because I keep getting put in situations of having to deal first hand with termed employees. And of recent I was put in a situation to meet up with a termed employee at our offices on a Saturday when no one is there. I have drawn the line here and documented my concerns in an email to HR and management. Thanks for the reassurance that I am making the right decision here stepping up to management.

 Working with an internal Tier 1, needing to call an SaaS vendor tier 1.
 I don&#x27;t know how you (internal/external) deal with us idiots.
 I just know the good/excellent tier one are easy to recognize... they quickly move up, and I miss them immediately.
 Note: I work for a large University/Hospital. YMMV.

In a snubbing fashion he mentioned Bitlocker since its the only encryption that can be used on Windows laptops. Am I wrong for thinking there are alternatives? I remember years ago there were.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and I am fairly new to my role. I have a head on my shoulders to not do something like this.
 A client has a server that was setup about a year ago. I was working on the server recently to install a TPM chip to have BitLocker setup and come to my surprise; I didn&#x27;t see a RAID controller; and then I went into Disk Management and confirmed my suspicion. 
 Disk 1: 500 GB: for OS
 Disk 2: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 3: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 4: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 5: 2TB Unused (Empty) 
 https://imgur.com/a/Y46NSS7
 Server is PowerEdge R540 128 GB Memory / Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz 
 Client has about 7 VMs being ran on this span of 3 hard drives. Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn&#x27;t know this yet. 
 I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?
 Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well. I was thinking of doing a RAID 1 for that.
 How would you go through and handle this issue and prevent as minimum downtime as possible to get this s*** fixed?

                              <span>I would love to throw myself into say a 6-month contract, fully commit to it, do the best job I can, learn as much as I can, save up as much as I can. And then when it&#x27;s finished take 2-3 months off to travel and such. Rinse and repeat.
 Is this viable? Or would it be seen in a negative light by employers, having all these &quot;career breaks&quot;? The way some people make it sound is if there is a 1-month gap in your resume, questions start being asked. 
 I appreciate any feedback! I feel like I need a change from the normal work lifestyle of indefinite mon-fri 10 hour days for the next 30 years until I retire. Contracting seems like it could be a good way to keep things fresh, experience different infrastructures and learn new skills. And generally seems to be better pay, I&#x27;d likely earn the same if not more even with the time off.

 Currently we don&#x27;t and I have no problem with it, but my boss is annoyed some people ask for headset when they might have had one already.
 My thought is maybe some kind of Microsoft form and some how targeting new hires with it.

                              <span>I have a Hybrid of exchange 2019 and O365. Exchange 2019 does not contain any mailboxes. All it is doing is granting local control. There are plans to remove this server. I am looking over the autodiscover settings in users outlook to troubleshoot disappearing shared mailboxes. 
 After Reading microsoft&#x27;s documentation, i&#x27;m a little lost.

So, everything is saying I will find a redirect to a redirect xml. I am seeing a list of words with the names of the discovery items and 0 as the dword value. The list contains autodiscover-s.outlook.com, and our owa, which isn&#x27;t reachable at the time. This is the first time I have seen -s. My DNS is a CName: Audotdiscover that leads to autodiscover.outlook.com. 
 How do I change these settings globally? Should I change this? Is this even a problem? Do you have additional resources/information? I know OWA is unreachable, and that might be causing some of this problem. 
 Thank you for any information you can help with.

In any case (ignoring the previous post please) what advice would you have for a mid level Sysadmin hoping to progress to be an IT manager.
 How many years experience should one have, how many certs one should study IF they are necessary.

I also want to make SSO work seamless from domain joined workstations from the Desktop apps (Outlook, OneDrive) and from browsers.
 So far I believe I need to configure password hash synchronization and then also Azure AD Seamless SSO? Is there a minimal level of M365 license required for this? Any lesson learned? Thanks.

                              <span>This could be a fun one for me. So I have an engineer working in a closed network environment with hardware. He&#x27;s currently using socat to connect COMM/Serial ports from his hardware into his system over PCI. His system runs some specialized software that re-packages information and the goal is to pipe it out to another system that&#x27;s expecting the traffic to come from a modem interface.
 There&#x27;s a few different types of modem emulation software I see on the web, but does anyone have any input or experience using them?

Its hard to tell from the FAQ but does anybody if this will remove enough of IE that it will break IE compatibility mode in Edge permanently?
 &quot; Note: The retired, out-of-support Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be permanently disabled on certain versions of Windows 10 as part of the February 2023 Windows security update (&quot;B&quot; release) scheduled for February 14, 2023. &quot;

                              <span>Made a script that basically locks down DCU, updates on a schedule, and applies a BIOS password to both the BIOS and DCU. It also hides all notifications and does not auto-reboot or prompt for it.
 We have all Dells and some desperately needed updates, this script does that and even changes the bios password if a existing one is already applied. Obviously this can all be changed to fit your needs.
 The regkey adds and take aways in the scripts are because that how we know if something is install or found in intune.
 This also takes away Dell bloatware. All in all im proud of it, took a while to fine tune it but it can always be improved. Just thought Id share.
 There is a Install, Uninstall, and detection script so it wont install on machines that arent Dells.

 My situation is grim to say the least, new to IT my site lead just left, only 5 months of experience and I had to migrate the COO&#x27;s computer to another one. Made a BitLocker though means of USB and thought I saved the recovery key but I did not. I saved the recovery key instead, Is there anyway to work around this? the COO will not be back in office to get his USB till Monday.

 We are trying to use the command prompt net group from a local login on a workstation.. This workstation is on the domain, but I&#x27;m logging in as the local user: .\localuser and not the domain\user.
 Command prompt code below: net group MYDOMAINGROUP /domain
 I can&#x27;t get the command prompt above to run on the .\localuser, but I can get it to run on the Domain\User. How can I get this to work on the .\localuser?
 The image below is a screenshot and results from the command prompt. The left command prompt is run as a domain user. the command prompt on the right is run as a local user. The local user is getting an System error 5 occurred Access is denied.. Does anyone know of any group policy objects or ways to get a local user to successfully request information from the domain controller? example

                              <span>Hi, we have an old unsupported application on our system, it has been decided that this needs to be isolated from the rest of the network due to it no longer receiving security updates.
 This application consists of a database which resides on a Win 2019 Std server with an associated service which facilitates client&#x27;s access to said database. Users have a client application which is installed on their Win 10 Pro machines which is used to access the database residing on the server.
 Both the server-side application and the client-side application would need to be isolated.
 Does anyone know of a solution I could use to facilitate this?

                              <span>Not too long ago, the email server market was spread across lots of different mail server products: Exchange (of course), Axigen, Ipswitch Imail, Kerio, Lotus Domino, MDaemon, Postfix, Neon Insight, Qmail, Sendmail, Smartermail, Sun Messaging server, Zimbra, Communigate, Mailenable and many others. Now, it seems, in the corporate space, due to the appeal of Microsoft&#x27;s vast product suite, most companies have moved or will be moving to Microsoft 365. Question: Is this setup healthy? This might be exaggeration, but in years to come, since all data will be housed and managed by one company (Microsoft), will we even need the SMTP protocol?

 Some rough specifics: 
  
The room is 30&#x27;x30&#x27;, with a 10&#x27; ceiling. 18&quot;-24&quot; raised floors.
 This room is not actively cooled, anticipated btu/hr is &lt;50K
  
What I&#x27;ve looked at thus far in the past couple of weeks (All units within the 3-5 ton range):
  
Dual Liebert PDX11&#x27;s with condensing units
 Dual Liebert Data mates/min mates with condensing units
 Dual Stulz MinSpace EC

 Cyber security is often very dry, confusing, and uninteresting to the average user. Ninjio has training which I think is informative, entertaining, and easy to digest. 
 Since we&#x27;ve started using them, our security instances have gone way down. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Checking previous posts on the subreddit i see how little regard people have on them, and this will not help matters. Their main SSL certificate expired 4 days ago. Tried to create an account to reduce the amount of captchas to fill for unblocking while handling a range of IPs that seems to have gotten a few IPs blacklisted there for some reason, the confirmation email required to activate the account never arrives (which makes sense if they use the certificate on their SMTP, providers would likely reject email from a server with an expired cert). And when using their contact form to let them know i get the very helpful response of:
  
An Error Occurred!
 Error:
  
And nothing else. 
 So, if anyone has an alternative way to nudge those people to go and fix their SSL, please do so. In the meanwhile i guess it&#x27;s captchas time...

 My problem is that I have racked my brain over a user issue which I cannot seem to solve using the obvious means and after lots of research online. What&#x27;s worse is that the user is already pushing hard and escalates things with our manager (yes he works in the it department as well).
 My question is whether it&#x27;s ok or not to admit that I don&#x27;t know how to resolute an issue, especially after exhausting all options I can think of.

I am looking for a product that will notify me via a message box popup or notification message while sitting at a windows 11 workstation for a few physical doors. I imagine that something like an IoT magnetic sensor exists, but most just seem to send notifications to phones - I want the popup on the workstation so that I see it while working on the PC. Any help or suggestions are appreciated.

                              <span>On all our administrative GUIs (VMware vCenter, Storage Systems, Back-up solutions, SAN management, iDRACs, Container Environment), we configure AD authentication together with basic (local) authentication. This basic authentication is used as a &#x27;workaround&#x27; in case AD would be unaccessible, or someone messes up the AD binding, or makes a change on AD level.
 While there are already cases where we had to use the local user, it poses a huge security risk since these are static credentials and there is no policy in place to rotate them. 
 How do you guys approach this? I&#x27;m aware Microsoft doesn&#x27;t recommend password rotation anymore and instead advices to use MFA together with long/complex passwords. I assume this is not possible with basic authentication? Would you disable basic authentication completely? What happened where you than were lock-out because of an underlying AD issue?

                              <span>Has anyone had any experience investigating changes to FGPPs in AD?
 I&#x27;ve had a situation where one changed and months passed without me noticing until I had an audit and noticed the modified date. I&#x27;m looking for if there&#x27;s any event logs I can monitor or failing that look at the object itself and potentially script a solution that&#x27;ll check the modified date routeinly so i&#x27;m not caught unaware again!

                              <span>Looking for ideas on how we can perform server administration/desktop administration for a 2 man IT team supporting ~160 users.
 as it is now I log in as a standard user to my desktop. For any type of desktop elevation I need to perform, I use my la_first initial last name account. If I need to log into the file server for example, I use my ja_first initial last name account to log into any server BUT the file server and jump to the file server using admin share to do what I need to do. Create a folder, permissions, etc. 
 So that’s 3 accounts I have. Well my boss has only recently started practicing separation of duties and we are looking at ways we can standardize this for both of us. I’ve just been recently promoted to a Jr. Sys admin and am going to be given more access to servers. 
 How do you handle this in your org?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just wasted an entire morning understanding why a static source directory was apparently changing files, only to realise Robocopy may be reporting the summary wrong.
 Each time I run a threaded command like...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /MT:32 /Z 
 ... on the same location I get a summary report each time with differing file counts and sizes.

 ​
 But running it standard (without the threaded switch)...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /Z 
 ...I get the same, correct result every time.
 ​
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 0 547 0 0 0 Files : 1370293 0 1370293 0 0 0 Bytes : 707.611 g 0 707.611 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:08:38 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:08:38 
 The threaded command copies the files fine (when I check manually), but I need to prove the results after and the summary suggests an incomplete copy.
 The threaded command is wicked fast compared to the normal way, but I&#x27;m having to run a slow /L after the fact just to prove the file counts match.
 ​
 Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just doing something wrong?

 The provider is not important but since I found an automatic scraper for Google Translate, I am going to use Google. The problem is that after only a few translations, my IP gets banned.
 How can I have my work done? Have in mind that I don&#x27;t care how long it is going to take. I just want it done. 
 P.S. I was thinking about paying for a proxy server but then I am going to rotate only about 10 IP, which, in my assumption, will also get banned.

                              <span>I am using free version of MobaXterm since a while and like the software a lot. 
 I was thinking to go for professional version but I’m not entirely sure whether it will cause any legal/license issues to me later on since my professional version will be for Personal use.
 I asked company IT team and they said as long as it doesn’t prompt local admin credentials to be entered, I can use it. 
 Some clarity would be helpful here. 
 TYIA! :)

 Anyone have an idea how this works? I cant find any MS Docs about this. If I set the setting Manually it works as expected, but creating new sites doesn&#x27;t set it right. If I press Reset settings to org-settings it changes to the correct setting, thats the most weird thing. Anyone any tips?

                              <span>Is there anyone here who has experience using Snipe-IT that can advise on its capability for tracking a large volume of repairs and RMAs?
 For a Little context, we currently use an out dated system that was developed in house to manage movement of assets(we provide retailers with IT hardware and often install loan equipment while we repair or obtain replacement equipment for the customer). We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.
 I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having &quot;Location A&quot; and &quot;Location A-RMA area&quot;). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.

Our company wants to provide IPADs to BODs with MS O365 subscription which enables the BODs to edit or view files on O365, however on the other hand my company also wants that BODs will only save files locally and restricts them to upload files on O365 cloud. Is it possible to restrict them or we cannot restrict them

 If you&#x27;re a SysAdmin, technician or IT &quot;manager&quot; in a small/medium sized company, where you&#x27;re the only on-site IT presence, and your company outsources support for network/server infrastructure, workstation support, third party liaison, 365 management etc. to an MSP, how are you justifying your role?
 I work for an MSP and have to deal with IT staff like this all the time, and I really can&#x27;t imagine how they manage to keep themselves busy on a day to day basis.
 I understand that anything that requires an on-site presence can be immediately handled by someone like yourselves, whether it be plugging in a replacement HDD into a NAS or installing workstations, replacing cables or …</span>

 ​
 We have a few hundred notebooks and (Mini-)PCs in our company, and a few months ago it seems Microsoft introduced a (or a few) very, VERY annoying bug(s) when it comes to mainly DisplayPort connected screens... things still worked pretty much without issues, so I (we) suspect a random Windows Update as the culprit by this point.
 ​
 People have called many, MANY times by now about (but not only) ...
 ... flickering displays
 ... screens that randomly turn black mid working, yet Windows still sees them as connected so it suddenly becomes a &quot;ghost display&quot;
 ... random colors flickering
 ... screens not waking up once it went into Standby
 ... weird resolution issues when using Display to DVI adapters
 ... and so on...
 ​
 I am... really at my end here and so is the rest of our IT team. This doesn&#x27;t just happen on notebooks, this also happens on Mini- and normal full size PCs, it doesn&#x27;t matter what graphics card even. This happens on Intel... NVidia... AMD... and so far this almost exclusively is happening on DisplayPort connected screens. Almost all of those displays don&#x27;t have HDMI tho, or if they have most of the Docking Stations only have one HDMI out.
 So yeah, just a little rant about this...

 As in title, I am fighting those pesky MS Store apps. I removed MS Store from my &quot;golden image&quot; however user is still able to install apps that are present in Start Menu, Messengers and alike. I do not have InTune, I work with Pro versions of Windows. Anybody is able to point me in the right direction? What I want to achieve is to prevent users from downloading/installing those apps.

(It was on my list of things to check but didn&#x27;t get to it in time.) No biggie, they&#x27;re renewed. Start popping them on everything that uses them. But I&#x27;ve never used/managed ADFS before, nor MS Dynamics 365 CRM. I walk through MS documents, get the certs setup for ADFS and get the Relying Party Trusts working again. I get certs renewed in the 365 Deployment Manager. Updated the CRM IIS bindings.
 I now get the login screen, and it logs in, but fails with: 
  
Error Details: ID4175: The issuer of the security token was not recognized by the IssuerNameRegistry. To accept security tokens from this issuer configure the IssuerNameRegistry to return a valid name for this issuer.
  
I don&#x27;t have cert thumprints in my web.config and as far as I can tell, everything is running the new cert. But it definitely isn&#x27;t, because something is failing. I&#x27;ve been googling and reading for the past day and haven&#x27;t figured it out. Any tips would be appreciated. If you help me figure it out, I&#x27;ll send you a local craft beer or donate to an animal shelter. Your pick :).

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty experienced with Varnish and VCL (sysadmin 2 years), but this seems to be an uncommon case because of a couple of factors.
 I have a new hitch/varnish server running as a remote caching proxy serving a node.js backend halfway across the Internet. The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can&#x27;t connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it&#x27;s serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -&gt; return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.
 How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000? There&#x27;s so many possible factors at play that I&#x27;m a bit lost. All replies appreciated.

We&#x27;ve configured the Azure connection, VPN gateway and local network gateway to use the approved APIPA ranges that Microsoft allows for custom APIPA addressing. In addition to this, the on-prem firewall peer is using the correct BGP APIPA addressing scheme in this design that is supported within the Azure documentation.
 From the packet captures, we&#x27;re seeing that even though it&#x27;s configured properly on the Azure VPN gateway with the APIPA addressing on both peers, the IPSec connection and o…</span>

                              <span>It’s a simple router on a stick setup. Switch is in L2 mode and the FG has 2 SVIs (Vlan 1 and 100). Port on switch is trunked, and default gateway is the FG. The FG is replacing a 2901 router, which I converted the config almost identical over to the FG. Works on the router but once I hook up to the FG, it dies. 
 Im thinking it’s a problem with the Virtual Interfaces being tagged with vlan 1 but I’m not sure. Seeing if anyone else ran into this.

                              <span>We host services for our clients in our datacenters, and they get access either through private wan connectivity, sdwan, or anyconnect. Usually we test circuits and such with iperf, but I was thinking it may be useful to setup a html5 speed test server on each of our datacenters that users and clients could be directed to with a url link. Opera would still be used for when we need to test isolated links. But for initial testing, it would be much easier than walking clients through iperf. 
 This isn&#x27;t something I want internet facing or anything, just for internal testing to our datacenters. 
 Has any one set something up like this in an enterprise setting? I see open speed test as an open source solution. But curious about potential security concerns because we would have to get it past security obviously. 
 Just looking to see if others have done something like this and what recommendations people may have.

 I&#x27;ve recently inherited a network where there is a site to site link connecting several remote servers to our network. Their remote servers and our internal network are on a class C address range (192.168.x.x). When I am connected to our network, I am able to ping the servers that are connected to us through the site to site SSL VPN. However, when I am connected to the VPN on a remote network I am unable to connect to the servers on the other end of the site to site link, no ping, and traceroute displays nothing. The VPN network was configured as a class…</span>

 We have recently bought Dell switches with OS10, configuration is pretty easy with VLT and I find it easier to manage as well. But our Dell Account Manager pushed us to install SONIC OS in the switches and I found almost very few documentations online and almost no documented best practices. (I had to reach out to Dell Technical team to find out that MCLAG Keepalive is not possible when the Management port is mgmt vrf)
 How was your experience in deploying Dell with SONIC?

                              <span>This is my first time moving network equipment over to being on its own restricted management VLAN.
 I am using an old switch to practice a few things on first, so that I dont screw up production.
 So with that said, I pulled an old Dell N2024P switch out of the closet, flashed the latest firmware, and did the following which seems to have worked in terms of setting up a management VLAN. What I did:
  
Add VLAN 10 called &quot;Mgmt&quot;
 Assigned IP address 10.11.10.6 /24 to the VLAN 10 interface.
 Removed the IP address from the default VLAN 1 interface
 Marked ports 1-23 untagged VLAN 1, marked port 24 untagged VLAN 10.
  
So with that, I now can only access the management interface for the switch by plugging into port 24 and assigning a 10.11.10.X /24 IP to my network adapter. Great, this is fun…</span>

                              <span>I’m predicting that with the timing of this year’s World Cup, it will become a huge fad(here in the US) that will explode over the Thanksgiving break and just about everyone will have at least one game streaming during peak network time, won’t be surprised if there are some who have the PC, Phone &amp; Tablet going at the same time. Obviously NBAR and some traffic shaping would be an easy fix but I’m convinced our company leadership has compromising photos of our department head and when the higher ups complain about the quality of their video stream, he will pass the problem onto us to implement some sort of solution.
 Currently our internet link utilization averages around 75-80% and we just use QoS to ensure critical traffic is guaranteed bandwidth when there is congestion. Increasing the capacity of our pipe isn’t an option and we’ve tried for years to alter our network acceptable use policy(people LOVE to buy switches on amazon and plug it into both wall jacks in their office). 
 Any recommendation regarding how I can manage this upcoming problem? I’m assuming that we’re not the only team with this issue particularly South Americans who also have to deal with the time difference and beloved sporting event happening during work hours.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 One of the company I work for would like to test some chassis before deployment. They can recover some parts from a partner venture (ISP) before purchase a batch of those.
 Initial config would go as follow:
 ASR-9006-AC-V2 (2 fans, 3 pwrs both V2)
 2x A9K-RSP880-LT-SE
 2x A9K-8X100GE-SE
 Beside common BGP, OSPF they need to be capable of :
  
Multicast Routing Protocols (PIM, IGMP)
 Security package (SSH, SSL)
 SSO-NSF, FHRP, LACP, BFD
 MPLS (Traffic Engineering, Layer 3 VPN including VRFs, RSVP, EVCs, Layer2VPN, EVPN)
  
For what I can read online, I don&#x27;t understand what difference is between A9K-RSP880-LT-SE and A9K-RSP880-SE is there any limitation to the LT version?
 Also I can read that we would need to buy some licensing for VRF which is this A9K-800G-AIP-SE.
 Is there anything else that would be required in order to make this work?
 Obviously I could go and ask Cisco but I already know I would only receive a explainer with a BOM for ASR99XX which we are not interested in currently.
 If anyone is an expert, I would glady listen to advice.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping for some guidance here in regard to a wireless implementation. Side Note: I&#x27;m fairly new to wireless.
 The implementation is across two physical Locations where one is a giant freezer and the other is an Ambient Warehouse. The AP&#x27;s in each area are in their own AP Group and Flexconnect Group. 
 The issue right now is when handheld devices are in the Freezer they have no signal.
 From what I can tell when testing signal on site. My laptop stays connected to the Ambient Warehouse when inside the Freezer. All the strongest signals I see when standing in the freezer are from the Ambient Warehouse AP&#x27;s and very bad signal from some of the AP&#x27;s in the Freezer.
 The AP&#x27;s in each area are different models. C9115AXI-E and AIR-CAP1532E-A-K9. A 3rd party designed and configured this solution, and I am lining them up for a troubleshooting session.
 ​
 Has anyone got any recommendation on what I need to be looking at?

                              <span>Hi all, first post on here but I have utilized this subs info for quite some time.
 To paint the general picture. I recently started a new position and found myself needing to assign some of our available static IPs for new security cameras that were being installed. This led me to the IP spreadsheet that the company utilizes. I know that this is not uncommon, but I have never encountered one so inaccurate/outdated. A few basic NMAP scans showed just how bad it is.. but not to derail, I got approval to begin purging and updating the spreadsheets.
 My current process (only testing atm, I have not begun updating the spreadsheet) is an NMAP scan: nmap -sn -PR and: nmap -sn -PS. I also run a scan through the IP Address Management tool in the Solarwinds toolkit that the company utilizes. Finally, I will ping the IP from the local switch itself (if applicable).
 I know this technique is redundant and most likely not the most effective method. Thus, before I begin, I was hoping to gather any suggestions or techniques that others may use to ensure that an IP address is not in use.

                              <span>This is an FYI post. For the last 2-3 weeks we have been having intermittent flapping of connectivity within our Meraki AutoVPN network. We have 4 offices in a mesh topology. The event logs on our MX firewall would show entries for &#x27;VPN Tunnel Connectivity Change&#x27; and &#x27;connectivity: false&#x27; while specifying the peer losing connectivity. It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues. Hoping this post will save someone some time in the future.

                              <span>Hi guys. Im trying to improve roaming capabilities of clients inside a massive cinderblock building of concrete. The equipment we are running is as follows
 AIR-CT5520-K9
 Mix of Cisco 3800/9120 APs.
 I was looking at the WLC and saw a few potential settings to modify to improve client connectivity. The building itself has a pretty good density of APs (over 90) and we do not want to or think adding more is the correct solution to fighting concrete everywhere.
  
Want to change client roaming aggressiveness under Wireless ----&gt; 802.11a/n/ac/ax to a minimum RRSI threshold of -80.
 Changing RF profiles specifically for this building.
  
Any thoughts or tips you guys have used in the past for this type of environment?

                              <span>hey i was wondering today why the private ip spaces are exactly e.g. 10.x.x.x or 192.x.x.x etc. instead of e.g. 1.x.x.x and then up to say 3.x.x.x. I didn&#x27;t find anything right away, but maybe someone here knows. 
 ​
 And also another question about this. What other IP spaces are there? I know about 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16. But I also know that there are spaces like 0.0.0.0/0 and 255.x.x.x/x.

I was looking at some online material and still don&#x27;t understand what are the conditions in which the advertised window on the receiver side and the effective window on the sender side may go to zero? I would appreciate if someone could help explain this to me please.

                              <span>I am trying to push multicast across a network and am unsure of myself. I have some Sr people to ask but I was hoping I might find some advice here too. I am peering with my RP via bgp on the edge of my network, a direct connect, that router is configured to accept multicast now but due to an oddity I have a switch next. So it is foreign RP, router, switch1, firewall, switch2, multicast clients.
 For the switch1 how would you all handle it? Would you turn on layer 3 and route multicast between the router and firewall or just extend a vlan between the two.

 We have a Meraki setup within our office. We are utilising 4 MS210-48LP switches and 17 MR36 WAPs placed throughout our office environment. Client devices are connecting via Wi-Fi only and this setup has been working for the past year without any issues.
 Over the last few days, we had a few reports of users complaining of Wi-Fi drops. In the last 48hrs, the problem has snowballed and a lot of users are now complaining of issues.
 I myself and a handful of users have not experienced the problem. I can&#x27;t pinpoint any differences between our client devices. All clients are HP and running Windows 10…</span>

 I have been requested to disable all ports besides a MAC ACL. Which contains the laptops that are allowed in , moving free in between ports.
 question is how do I make the list synchronized in between two switches,
 and how do I make the list efficiently considering there are more than 50 different laptops.
 Thanks for your help (:

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I face an issue in my network environment, the detail is as following:
 We have 2 ISP with the IP&#x27;s (example) below :
 ISP 1: 103.45.24.0/24
 ISP 2: 203.17.25.0/24
 ​
 here is our brief environment: https://ibb.co/gv36xDx
 ​
 There is requirement from my manager whether is it possible, if we have app publish to internet where if the IP public from ISP 1 (103.45.24.0/24) - dnat to - Web Server is down or fail then the IP (103.45.24.0/24) failover to ISP 2. Otherwise, if IP Public ISP 2 down or fail then the IP failover to ISP 1 ?
 ​
 I have searched and still looking for anything about BGP who explain this explicitly but still have no clue how to configure it.
 ​
 I have basic knowledge in networking and make use GNS3 for lab and prove of concept before going into production.
 ​
 If there is a paid course or anything in particular or video tutorial that i can follow.
 I would like to take and pay for it.
 ​
 Really appreciate anyone who look into this.

                              <span>Hi,
 I ve 2 router and each router connect to different ISP with different AS number. 
 Router A in AS10 and announce 10.10.10.0/24 subnet without prepend and announce 10.10.20.0/24 subnet with AS_prepend AS10-AS10.
 Router B in AS20 and announce 10.10.20.0/24 subnet without prepend and announce 10.10.10.0/24 subnet with AS_prepend AS20-AS20.
 So the internet sends 10.10.10.0/24 to AS10 and sends 10.10.20.0/24 to AS20. But in recent days ISP of Router B has a problem and we aren&#x27;t receive trafic to 10.10.20.0/24.
 Is there any solution to ınternet knows 10.10.20.0/24 from AS10, without changing AS_prepend config. For example is there any command for when i notice again ISP B has a problem.
 Thanks,

                              <span>So, I set up a Ubiquiti network for a client last summer: Edgerouter-X + Unifi WAPs. Flat LAN: all on 192.168.10.0/24 (all good since then).
 Now, he has some Ethernet-capable CNC machines and a monitoring device (from Chatter), and the monitoring service told him to set up VLANs. So, he asked me to set up VLANs.
 I go out, set up VLANs as follows:
  
192.168.10.0/24 -&gt; VLAN 0 (default, original)
 192.168.20.0/24 -&gt; VLAN 20 for CNCs
 192.168.30.0/24 -&gt; VLAN 30 for Wifi
  
For the machines, we set static IPs since he uploads designs to the machines via FTP and he types in the IP address directly. Fine, good.
 I set the CNCs&#x27; static IPs as:
  
192.168.20.11 (later)
 192.168.20.12
  
VLAN 20 DHCP range is 192.168.20.101 to 192.168.20.200 to reserve the lower range for static IPs.

                              <span>I have been testing Juniper Access switches and Mist wired assurance recently. I have gone through testing all the features we require (802.1x, dhcp security, voice vlans and qos, switch stacking, etc) and it seems to check all the boxes. Mist is missing a few knobs, but we can accomplish these through CLI templates. What is everyone&#x27;s recent experience, specifically around ex4400 and potentially ex4100? We use MX routers and have had very good success with these. We also have been deploying Mist wireless with good success. My main concern is code and hardware reliability.

 I would like to know if there exists scenarios where an 802.1Q tag is applied by the host from which the traffic originates rather than by a network device which forwards that traffic. I have yet to encounter such scenario.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So may be a dumb topic, by hey nothing gained if nothing ventured.
 So I pass CCNA last year in January which been sitting on collecting dust since I been focus on RHCSA which finally passed yesterday. So I realize I should look into ways on how to renew it. I think Continuing education credits would be the quickest but also going for CCNP would work as well.
 with the later however, it meant to go more in depth on networking which would be interesting. only problem why I&#x27;m a little hesitant is from a Odem book I had some time ago certain topics in the early chapter mention technology which was cisco exclusive. I mean that expected since its is Cisco lol, but reason CCNA get respect is that it try to stay as foundational as possible.
 So I want to ask anyone who made a jump to 301 to ENCORE (which I gather the most congruent pathway) just how similar are they in term of concepts. like a 20% differences, &amp; if so are said differences more Cisco&#x27;s exclusives protocols and such?
 P.S if anyone know where to find learning material which just touch the new stuff. pretty please let I know!

                              <span>I’ve recently come into the position of being the IT admin for a small video company with existing IT infrastructure and could use some help recovering a VPN that’s stopped working some time in the last 2 weeks. Now when trying to connect — all our VPN clients run macOS Ventura or Monterey — I instantly receive the following error message:
  
VPN Connection
 The L2TP-VPN server did not respond. Try reconnecting. If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator.
  
I’ve observed the same error message on both macOS versions mentioned.
 The public IP doesn’t respond to ping — which I know doesn’t necessarily mean anything other than all the ports on the router are stealthed, which is fine from a security standpoint — although all other network resources (authentication, NAS access, internet access from the inside) are working just fine.
 The network runs on:
  
A Ubiquiti UniFi USG-PRO-4 firewall
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Switch 48 US-48-500W PoE switch
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2 UCK-62 controller
 A Dell PowerEdge T320 running Windows Server 2012
  
I reached out to the previous IT guy, but he’s incommunicado. Then I found some Windows Server updates pending … those’ll get installed tonight.
 Any help, even diagnosing from first steps would be greatly appreciated!

As part of my bachelor&#x27;s thesis I was tasked with analyzing, deploying and testing flexiWAN Open Source SD-WAN solution so I can later compare it to other SD-WAN solutions on the market. Unfortunately so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find any meaningful resources regarding flexiWAN SD-WAN other than what you can find on their website, which is not much. That brings me to the question, does someone here have experience working with flexiWAN, who could point me to study resources or anything that would give me an insight into how the tech works ?

                              <span>Hey guys.
 Currently have a small network with a single ISP line. We are adding another ISP with matching address space. Our address spaces are from the provider and are too small to advertise with BGP. 
 Outbound traffic seems pretty easy and lots of options with FHRP/track objects/route maps/etc but was wondering about inbound traffic. We have an authoritative DNS server being hosted on-prem. Wondering if I could add multiple glue records with each provider&#x27;s address and have multiple host records to allow inbound traffic to failover.
 Also wondering the pros/cons of using VRRP vs track objects and a floating static route. Have labbed the scenario just having a floating static on the main provider tied to a track object and having the secondary provider router inject a default route into OSPF. If the primary goes down then the static will be replaced by the OSPF learned route.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m looking to get rid of a Fast Ethernet Bridge that links two nearby office buildings. I would replace it with an SFP Module that plugs directly into the main switches in each building. That said I want to make sure I get the right module.
 From what I see, we have a black (Multi Mode?) run that runs underground into each building. From there it goes into a beige box with multiple jacks. The beige junction box then connects to a Fast Ethernet Bridge using a Fiber Patch Cable.
 I&#x27;m not sure if you can tell from the picture but I&#x27;m pretty sure I need a MultiMode SFP Module for both of my switches. Any clarification\correction on the correct module would be appreciated.

                              <span>TL;DR: How do you use REST APIs to improve your monitoring abilities?
  
With the increase of focus on DevOps has led to performing many actions and automated tasks with APIs! You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. 
 What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? 
 Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. 
  
 Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? 
  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I&#x27;m not an application or web developer by any means, so I can&#x27;t speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I&#x27;m more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.

                              <span>Hi,
 In my company, we are supporting many remote office locations. A common complaint is to see that wireless or wired network speeds are slow (most engineers will be familiar with same). 
 Just wondering, what tools/apps you use to document and test network speeds in a global network environment?
 I am thinking of a way to benchmark network performance. i.e get an onsite contact to run a series of test on LAN/WLAN etc and to document the results versus what the expected results should be.
 This can then be used as the benchmark when future issues are raised to help understand if the speeds are compromised, links saturated or other IT issue etc
 Any suggestions on tools or similar processes or any thoughts in general?

                              <span>Hey guys, feeling kinda dumb on this one and I figured this would be the right place to ask a quick question.
 Does anyone know of a set of Visio stencils (preferably vendor-agnostic) containing pretty much all conceivable switch sizes - 8, 12, 16, and so on - with anchor points on each port? 
 I&#x27;m putting together some Visio diagrams of an existing network we&#x27;ll be taking over. It&#x27;s an absolute rat&#x27;s nest, and we&#x27;re likely going to tear it all out regardless.. but I&#x27;d like to write an as-built that encapsulates Layer 1, and review it with outgoing IT to make sure our cutover plan captures everything.
 edit: Guys, respectfully, I&#x27;m not looking for pointers on network documentation. This is a unique situation necessitating this visualization, and I&#x27;m just asking if anyone&#x27;s aware of a stencil set that might help accommodate it.

                              <span>Good morning,
 I am having an issue with my native VLAN assignment for some reason and I am not sure why. I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this
 BR-44-MDF&gt; show vlan members port 1/1/49
 vlan type status
 100 default forwarding
 112 qtagged forwarding
 164 qtagged forwarding
 184 qtagged forwarding
 188 qtagged forwarding
 601 qtagged forwarding
 When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with 
 Native VLAN: 1
 Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188
 I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn&#x27;t throw an error for overlapping subnets. 
 BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief
 Interface IP Address Interface Status
 vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up
 vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up
 I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>Do you have documented sleep standards for doing major, or at least non-routine work? I&#x27;m hearing more &quot;man, I was really tired, but I got it done&quot; comments from my team. One comment about how work didn&#x27;t go smoothly, but it did complete, but they didn&#x27;t sleep well the night before.
 It&#x27;s not something I ever thought about for our team, but other industries have such standards, so I&#x27;m curious what others think/do.

                              <span>The buzz of ZTA and ZTNA is there however it is difficult to keep up with all the vendors and products. Even if you fluent with big boys like Cisco, Forti, Palo and Checkpoint (does Zscaler counts there?) there are many point solutions and vendors looking at some specific subdomains only, for example just datacenter mico-segmentation or only remote access.
 Is there some restless team of professionals giving it a try and showcasing GUI and declared features? Have you seen YouTube or series of blog articles?
 Thanks.

 I’m looking for some advice on fiber carrier connectivity from Bermuda to U.S. the company I work for has an office and DC. Today they use Link Bermuda and another ISP but the cost is exorbitant due to data usage charges. A local manager brought up Horizon Communications but I’m looking to see all options available.
 Any advice is appreciated.
 Cheers!

                              <span>I have recently been pulling devices into zabbix for our Network monitoring (Used PRTG in the past)
 I have notice that I&#x27;m getting alerts on 4 of our 13 Netgear switches for interface cpu() with operational statuses of 1 (up) and 2 (Down). Sometimes it shows down for a few minutes other times over 10 mins. The switches are still operational during this time as far as I can tell. Doesnt seem to be any coloration between model numbers either.
 The SNMP OID is 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.51. cant really seem to find anything on this OID for netgear kit. anyone have any pointers for me? 
 Models with this issue are GS748T V4H1 , 2x GS716T V2, GS724T V3,

I was thinking instead to turn them into Air Monitors but I am a bit unsure as to what value I will actually see from these? I have configured an AP group as Air Monitors and put some access points in it but I can&#x27;t really see how I monitor or quantify the value they add or log what they are actually doing for our environment? We are running Mobility Conductors with 8.6 and we also have Airwave. Is there somewhere I can monitor the Air Monitors and see what they are achieving? Cheers.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Im trying to connect a copper SFP 10G (from Mikrotik) to a stacked C9300 to a DELL switch (that also supports 10Gb) but there is no link between them. I&#x27;ve tried different ethernet cables but no success. I tried the same ethernet cable to connect between two regular 1G copper port and it works so nothing wrong on the cable (it is a CAT6 cable). 
 I also tried to connect the copper SFP between the stacked switches (I connected one copper SFP in one port on the master switch and one copper SFP in the slave switch and connected an ethernet cable between them) and still no success, but Im not sure if you could do these tests between stacked switches.
 Either way, I also checked if that the interfaces are not in shutdown mode or err-disabled mode.
 I configured the &quot;service unsupported-transceiver&quot; to see if that will change anything but no success. 
 The setup I have is a stacked 9300 (two switches) and plugged in two copper SFPs, one in the master switch and one in the slave switch that goes to a dell switch so I can form a LACP between the stacked C9300 and the dell switch.
 Appreciate any help.

                              <span>I just have a short question. When I log in my FMCv it says that FX-OS v2.x is installed. So im wondering why a FMCv needs a FX-OS ? I thought that is just needed on hardware for chassis Management.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently reworking our corporation&#x27;s wifi and I&#x27;ve got EAP-TLS working, however I want to permit only a specific group of users from our local AD.
 I&#x27;ve got the CA up and running and publishing certificates all around to the computers (old setup) and I&#x27;ve got the ruleset for EAP-TLS working with GPO on the Windows domain computers.
 My problem now is that I need to permit access only to a specific group in AD as the ruleset just points to users/domain computers so everyone with a domain computer gets access.
 Once a user who&#x27;s not in the group logs on I want the authentication to fail.
 I&#x27;ve tried adding /users/domain computers AND /group/ as a requirement in the auth policy, but the group I added in ISE External Identity Source/groups doesn&#x27;t show up in the policy. I also removed a few groups and it doesn&#x27;t seem to update in the policy set or the condition library.
 Is this a known bug in ISE 3.1?
 I need the computers to log in to the wireless prior to actually logging into the computer so it can reach the DC for login, then drop out of the user is not in the specific Security Group.

                              <span>Hello Dear Subreddit, 
 I need to migrate a IPSEC Tunnel from a Sophos UTM to a Fortigate 200F.
 Remote Gateway is a Checkpoint Firewall. So far so good. 
 Now I face 33(!) SA&#x27;s which are established on the Sophos. Let me point you a picture:
 Sophos : Site A
 Checkpoint: Site B
 ​
 Site A got following Networks:
 192.168.105.0/24
 192.168.100.0/22
 and a Host 192.168.40.100/32 
 ​
 Site B:
 10.3.0.0/24
 10.2.0.0/24
 10.1.0.0/24
 10.1.7.0/24
 10.1.4.0/24
 10.1.6.0/24
 10.1.2.0/24
 10.1.1.0/24
 10.1.8.0/24
 10.1.5.0/24
 10.1.3.0/24
 ​
 I&#x27;d love to do SNAT on Site B, but I&#x27;ve never done that on Checkpoint. I know on FortiGate we can use 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and let the Policies do the Denying. Is there a way to do that on Checkpoint or how would you go about this problem ?

                              <span>I have a Japanese shitbox PR-600MI.
 I am trying to have traffic come into the LAN ports on the router and then get routed to my sperate internal network.
 The static routing doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. All of the LAN cables have to be plugged into the PR-600MI and there is no way around that aspect.
 I&#x27;m trying to fix the internal routing as the solution.
 PR-600mi network: 192.168.1.1/24 Linksys velop network: 10.10.10.1/24
 I had the Linksys velop on the 192 network but the pr600 was blackholing all dhcp requests and wouldn&#x27;t work.
 Tried changing it to a different subnet but now the pr600 won&#x27;t route to the 10.10 no matter what I do, including static routes.
 Does anyone have any experience with velop ? Maybe it is a Linksys side issue?

                              <span>So my company will be opening a manufacturing plant in the next year or so. I need to start planning the network for this location and am looking for any advice or things to consider when planning. I have built out dozens of networks in the past but they have always been for office locations not manufacturing and I am not sure if anything special is needed. 
 Any advice you can provide would be helpful. Thanks

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with finding a digital signage solution that acts as screensavers for all computers. Should be easily editable by our PR for company news. Every solution I’ve tried (load website as screensaver but uses IE, optisign) has been completely unpredictable with our 15 minute Lock Screen policy. Has anyone had any experience with undedicated digital signage that could point me in the right direction?

Is it possible to use the ethernet ports for VM communication and then use the sfp ports between the servers for HA/vMotion traffic? If so, is it configured in the Dell settings or esxi? Thanks.

                              <span>Always interested to hear the kinds of traps to avoid when setting up something new. I&#x27;m making a completely fresh AD/AAD environment for fun, trying to mirror our current hybrid environment, and want to make sure I do it as cleanly and future-proofed as possible. It&#x27;s going to be my personal test environment, I&#x27;m hoping it can save me some trouble in the future since half the time there seems to be some little bug or security hardening that sneaks through unnoticed (or undocumented) for monthly patching. Plus it&#x27;s a fun project in general, I always end up taking jobs where it&#x27;s all set up already, never got to try making my own environment fully from scratch. So far I&#x27;m just building lots of Server 2022 VMs in Hyper-V on a spare laptop and using a free Azure account to see how far I can get, going to be a long road ahead to get everything like our work environment but hopefully will learn a lot.

                              <span>I had a group of help desk guys who would play RuneScape all day and would barely put in effort. They never went above and beyond for anyone and just did the bare minimum.
 I admit I’m not the best manager I’m a systems engineer who got thrown into management. I let the get away with a lot to try and avoid conflict. One day I got fed and told them no more games, no more messing around at work, and started opening tickets up for everything. I really turned up the heat. I ended our 2 day remote policy.
 The help desk guys started dropping like flies and quit with out having another job. I’ve re-hired new help desk guys and 6 months later they are the most efficient group ever and the company is even giving them a raise due to the hard work they put in.
 I learned my lesson as a new manager. I’m so happy that everything ended up okay.

We are only seeing this on older (Haswell/Broadwell based) hosts. I checked chipset drivers, they are latest supplied by manufacturers. Culprit is the intelppm.sys driver, which seems to be some kind of power management service; disabling the service from Automatic Recovery allows the machine to boot normally again.
 Edit: I should add the bsod error is SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

                              <span>Good day, all! I am interested in what tools, applications or suites this community uses to monitor their IIS servers. My team would like to monitor for number of connections, system / site performance, etc, for our locally hosted server and it looks like any number of tools out there will work though there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any recent information or opinions from real Sys Admins.
 And so here I am, asking this community for your thoughts, feelings, experiences with the multitude of products out there. I don&#x27;t have any preferences (paid vs. open source, etc); I&#x27;m just genuinely interested in your reviews and recommendations before diving into any number of free trials and getting talked up by sales folks.
 Thanks in advance. Cheers!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in my current role nearly 10 years, and to be honest for the most part I really enjoy it. They&#x27;ve been pretty lacking in pay raises and bonuses though, and when a former colleague set me up with an interview, I took it - my first interview in 10 years.
 It went well, and they made me an offer which is nearly 35% above my current salary. Obviously it&#x27;s an incredible offer, and I&#x27;m delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it&#x27;s going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I&#x27;m accepting.
 Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I&#x27;m not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I&#x27;d need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who&#x27;s 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do the nursery run.
 My new prospective boss says that in his team, he&#x27;s super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I&#x27;m just.... Hesitant. I know that it&#x27;s because of my WFH lifestyle that I&#x27;m used to - I guess I&#x27;m just wondering, how do I get over this fear? Have any of you made a similar transition?

                              <span>Today I had my customer, who is in a highly regulated sector, come to me. We are in the middle of a datamigration from onprem to Azure Files. He asked how much it costs to backup the Azure Files. I give him a quote. His answer: &quot;Well that&#x27;s really expensive. I&#x27;m not sure if we need to do it. I mean, how often do you need backups? &quot;
 Well mister, you might want to contact your auditor and state that &#x27;indeed: we do not backup our most important financial data&#x27;. I got it al written down and escalated to my manager. I know that backups are required in this sector but the client itself apparently does not. My lord it&#x27;s only wednesday and I need a drink.

                              <span>How do I convince C level users that having one person in IT support and keeping Admin rights is insane. We have no security posture and whenever I mention security it is treated like it’s working against the company. As with many companies security is an after thought which is then ignored. As I have a life I’ve stopped working late to support the company because I need to have a work life a balance. 
 Development of course has many people many devops engineers but there is no infosec, CTO, CIO, Tech lead or anyone of the sort.
 P.S I know quitting is a good move considering I care more about the company than the owners but I want to see if I can find a way to get a managerial promotion and if I can save this ship. I’ll probably be leaving anyways.

The president wants me right there in the middle of the office to take care of issues but there is nobody to connect with. People only come to my desk to complain and sometimes I wish I had a (IT Dungeon) to hide in. I felt less lonely working from home in a help desk environment. Maybe this is just a rant but any solo IT people also feel this way.

                              <span>Hi, Will give a bit of info about current setup. What I have ready to go in and then the big question.
 So, i work with another IT guy in the company I&#x27;m currently at. Hes so behind the times but he has been here 10 years longer than me so people just go with what he says and people are afraid to say anything to him as we use this bespoke software that he keeps in his head, I&#x27;ve asked for years for him to show me but he never does, put in compaints that he hasnt shown me and nothing is done about it, its so frustrating. I actually found him running the backups from a 2003 server on a P4 a few weeks ago with an external drive hanging from it. He refused to stop running it so i took the RAM out of it. 
 Our sister company which is the breadwinner in this outfit use IT to max and there are 70…</span>

                              <span>So we are planning a business continuity test. We have two sites. In the primary site we have two DC&#x27;s, in the secondary site we have one DC. IPSEC tunnel between the two sites. 
 The scenario is a disaster happens at the primary site. Everybody needs to login at the secondary site. (different FW, different VPN). We disable the IPSEC tunnel and we disable the FW policies between the two sites to simulate the disaster at the primary site. Everything works and is tested.
 I was just wondering what would happen when the DC in the secondary site can&#x27;t reach the DC&#x27;s in the primary site and vice versa. What would happen if there are some actions to be done at the DC in the secondary site during the business continuity test, like password resets, GPO changes etc. Will the changes sync without issues to the DC&#x27;s at the primary site when the connection is restored? Not planning on doing modifications though, just in case. 
 No Active Directory Sites &amp; Services configured, I know, it&#x27;s on the todo list :)

DC&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t talk to each other at all. It was my first truly oh shit moment. Took down the company for 3 hours. Today I got sometime to go back and start looking at the issue . The password for the krbtgt account has not been reset in about 8 years. When I run the klist command it shows AES-256 connection from and to every machine I have looked at. The only exceptions is the krbtgt and our QNAP device. QNAP will be something I look at afterwards. We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time there. Anyhow, my thinking is it is still using RC4 because that was the last time the account had its password reset and to move it up to AES-256 the password needs to be reset. 
 ​
 Can anyone confirm if my thinking is right?
 I&#x27;ve been told by multiple people that resetting the password for the krbtgt account has not caused any problems. Has anyone had any issues with this?

 So patching up openSSL on linux servers were pretty easy. But i have not found a way to easily deploy it to Windows servers.
  
 Have anyone found an easy way to mitigate the vulnerabilities? Or do i have to go full on manual installation.

 During the initial conversations between us and them, all of a sudden our emails stopped being received. We informed them of such and did some investigations on our side.
 Initial investigations showed that WTHlogistics had 3 published MX records. 
 20 mailgate.wthlogistics.com 25 mailgate2.wthlogistics.com 30 wthlogistics.mail.protection.outlook.com 
 It appeared that our mailhost started sending mail to priority 30, which is then being accepted by the server, but then is not being forwarded on to their mailbox, so we politely informed them of this…</span>

 I log into the teams meeting and there is my old boss whom I’ve known for about 18 years looking ghost white with blood shot eyes.

 While there are many guides that tell you how to do this, Nearly all of them seems to be relying on 3rd party software.
 I would like to create this drive using only builtin Windows tools, I have already done it with a MDT image so im hoping it can be done similarily with other images.

 Some came with a usb c charger, others with the standard 19v brick. We had 2 very similar hp models with the only difference being the size but one came with a usb-c charger and the other one didn&#x27;t. 
 Why? Why are they still using custom 19v chargers when all of them are capable of charging through usb-c... 
 Sorry for this rant. It just annoys me that i need to have 10 different spares instead of a single standardised one.

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m a sysadmin at a big healthcare provider in the UK. 
 Our tools are showing &quot;brute force attack&quot; alerts because thousands of accounts in AD are being locked out. And i&#x27;m talking sometimes a dozen lockouts per account per day. 
 But here&#x27;s the kicker - we have no login failures. So there are no failed logins at all for 99% of the affected accounts. 
 We have no idea what is triggering the account lockouts. The source of the account lockouts is showing a web server we use for the website, so we were considering whether its AD-integrated web server which is causing the issue, but its also showing thousands of account lockouts originating from dozens of other assets/servers in the network. 
 We have a decent sized team looking at it but we&#x27;re coming up with nothing. 
 Any ideas here?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I wanted to send notifications from Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.
 I created a new azure user ie.: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com).
 I added this user to the group which exclude the user from any Conditional Access settings.
 I created NewSMTPBasic authentication policy (AllowBasicAuthSmtp true) and assigned it to the user
 I setup SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled : False 
 My settings of Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows are 
 smtp server: smtp.office365.com
 email: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 port: 587
 SSL/TLS: Yes
 user to authenticate: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 Password: password of [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com) 
 My problem is that it works only with above settings. If I want to change email address to any email like: [djwheele@domain.com](mailto:djwheele@domain.com), [anymail@domain.com](mailto:anymail@domain.com), any existing users in our domain it doesn&#x27;t work. 
 Did You ever had similar issue? Can You help me to solve it? Why I can send emails only to the user who is used to authenticate on smtp.office365.com ???? 
 Thank You in advance.

I&#x27;ve met some guys who are really solid (and tbh, I&#x27;ve noticed that most of the ladies I&#x27;ve run into have been very competent &amp; far more responsive compared to some of their gentlemen counterparts) but 70-80% of the time I feel like I am herding cats trying to get stuff done.
 Language barrier isn&#x27;t the problem - I can appreciate that they probably aren&#x27;t speaking English as a 1st or even a 2nd language, but much of the time it genuinely feels like pulling teeth. I will ask questions, ie &quot;so you&#x27;ve found X, we need to work on Y to get service back up and running - is that correct?&quot; and instead of a yes or no, I will get an &quot;OK&quot; and I will have to reiterate that I a…</span>

                              <span>Apologies if this is the wrong place to be asking this question, but it is my first time seeing this issue before thought I would try my luck here.
 We have an on-prem environment using a local domain - just a standard dc server with AD and a RDS server - User1 is already logged on to the RDS server. Then User2 comes in to start their day logs into a Windows 10 PC which is domain joined and receives &quot;Welcome User1&quot; in the windows login greeting and User1 is then disconnected from their RDS session and User2 has actually loaded User1&#x27;s profile - desktop icons and all.
 Any ideas what may be causing this, I have tried the following:
 -Removed User1 and User2&#x27;s profiles from the Windows 10 PC and then re-added only User2 back on to the device but the issue is still occurring - User 1 no longer uses the Windows 10 PC just works on the RDS.
 -Removed the Windows 10 PC from the domain and re-joined to the domain. The RDS server itself is new only a month or two old has been happening ever since the RDS server was setup I was informed.
 any further suggestions on what else we can try here? - getting close to the too much time wasted - blow away windows and reinstall and see if it happens again.

 i&#x27;m having a issue regarding Skype accounts. We are currently working with Microsoft teams but all our suppliers (based in Vietnam and India) are using Skype personal.
 We can&#x27;t use our teams account to skype to them but we also can&#x27;t create a &quot;personal&quot; skype account beceause we have teams accounts...
 i would like to prevent to have users create skype accounts with their personal emails... how can i create a &quot;personal&quot; skype account with a &quot;business&quot; email adress.
 (FYI: Skype is still beeing heavily used at our suppliers)
 Thank you for the input and feedback!

                              <span>All our DCs return the same &quot;DomainController&quot; value as the output to get-kdsrootkey. Does this mean that DC is the only holder of the root key? No FSMO roles remain on that DC and its decom is imminent. 
 Does it need moving? (I don&#x27;t see any chatter about moving such a thing when Googling) or destroying and recreating? What does that mean for the existing MSAs?
 your responses always greatly appreciated

                              <span>I work at a company with a good MDM solution, they don&#x27;t want people using their personal, unregistered devices to access work email. Normally this works out fine and they get a &quot;blocked&quot; message when the mobile browser is detected.
 But recently a loophole was discovered - on Android phones at least, users have the ability to trick the system by enabling desktop mode and then logging in through 2 factor.
 This is possible because getting into email by 2 factor through personal computers is allowed. But we don&#x27;t want people on their phones doing it, otherwise what&#x27;s the point of using an MDM? This loophole was discovered only on Android but it&#x27;s possible it exists on iPhones too.

                              <span>Kinda lost on this one.
 A friend asked why when they google their website, when someone clicks the link for website on the right hand side (not the google returned link on the left) it redirects to a rotating spam URL for prescription viagra pills. If you browse to the URL manually and then click the website link on the right, it will redirect properly from that point on.
 If you click the returned website on the left it correctly goes to the site. Ping the address and it returns the correct IP as recorded in the ICANN lookup.
 Any suggestions? Site is hosted through GoDaddy and I have no admin controls, just a friend asking for help.

                              <span>I knew that it would be complicated to do this but it seems almost impossible to me after trying for two days. 
 I am trying to do redirection using iptables. The number one problem is that local connections do not go through the PREROUTING chain in nat. I also suspect that they bypass the nat table altogether because none of the connections are reaching my rules in nat. 
 Is it possible to redirect traffic from the filter table instead of the nat table? 
 Before I started, I was worried about redirect loops but now I&#x27;ll be happy if I get a redirect loop.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I was recently hired to a small company as the sole IT guy. I&#x27;ve had about two years of non-traditional Helpdesk experience at a different company handling their proprietary machines and software.
 The company I&#x27;m at now has about ~60 devices exclusively on MAC OS and no MDM, administrative directory or cybersecurity solutions in place. They want me to come up with a solution for phishing and other threats. I did some research on MDMs like Jamf Pro in conjunction with Apple Business Manager. I&#x27;ve also looked a bit at Barracuda for phishing. I&#x27;ve figured an MDM would be a good starting point but apparently need a strong knowledge-base to implement (lest I break something) along with some scripting.
 I&#x27;m honestly not really sure what direction to go in. Any resources for learning how to implement an MDM for Mac OS if this is the best route? Other suggestions?

Summary
From mid-June through mid-July 2022, CISA conducted an incident response engagement at a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) organization where CISA observed suspected advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. In the course of incident response activities, CISA determined that cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence. CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that the FCEB network was compromised by Iranian government-sponsored APT actors.

                              <span>Hello! I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a &quot;flow&quot; type as well as a &quot;ip_flow_start&quot; and &quot;ip_flow_end&quot;. The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)
 As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. 
 I don&#x27;t think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.
 Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?

                              <span>Hey everyone! I posted about this a couple months ago when I was trying to get the hardware, but now that I&#x27;ve had everything in my hands and have been trying to work with it, I&#x27;m stuck. I&#x27;ve literally been trying for 2 months. We currently have 2 TRENDnet TFC-110 MSTs that link our two buildings together using fiber. With the help of some others on Reddit, I purchased these two items (https://www.fs.com/products/11774.html and https://www.fs.com/products/43465.html). I got 3 of each to have backups in case one went bad. My Unifi switches recognize both SFP modules, but I cannot get the two switches to talk to each other with the fiber line that works just fine with the TRENDnet modules. Does anyone have ideas? I&#x27;ve tried everything I know (switching the fiber connections, restarting switches, changing cables/modules) and I&#x27;m stumped. Thanks!

 Now, this hasn&#x27;t always been going on, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure what changed to make it begin popping up, but it&#x27;s causing a lot of issues with our AnyConnect Management Tunnel connections, as the mgmt tunnel will not even attempt to connect if the credentials prompt is up. Once you &quot;x&quot; out of the prompt, the mgmt tunnel connects immediately.
 Has anyone else run into this?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have some later generation Extreme BOSS switches with multi-link trunking or MLT downstream to some VMWare ESXi servers. We have four links from the switch to one of our servers for instance.
 Are we supposed to ONLY configure trunks (no other LAG/LACP/MLT) downstream to these hypervisors? I noticed we have an exponential amount of broadcasts coming in from these MLT downstream switchports.
 IE on Cisco: conf t int fa0/1 switchport trunk encap dot1q switchport mode trunk
 We don&#x27;t have a distributed vSwitch connecting to these switches.

                              <span>Hi, everyone I’m new to this sub and I’m just wondering if anybody is able to give me some advice on how to basically convince my boss to promote me from field tech to UC engineer. They have been looking for someone for about a year now, they hired someone recently but it didn’t work out at all, the guy did not know what he was doing so the position is back open. Put IT dept is finally getting rid off a lot of old and slow programs and I believe with me being young and eager to solve problems and make everyone life easier I should be a good fit. I’m just wondering what type of skills or metrics to look at I should bring to my boss to convince him on giving me the job. I already got Azure cert and I work Cisco devices all day so I know those.
 I want to bring these tools that I believe can help me do the job.

 To me it seems like cloud, automation and security are the big 3, but I&#x27;m more interested in discussion about tangible skills or tech instead of broad strokes, like just generally saying cloud. Stuff like more using Ansible to create vendor neutral configs or using Grafana to create single pane of glass dashboards.

                              <span>Got 3 iSCSI hosts and 2 clients using 2x mpio over two switches. We don&#x27;t have any VM OSes stored on them, just file, backup and archive storage. Used what I had which were cheap Netgear switches and now I&#x27;ve had to reboot a switch again due to a port or two locking up after 9 months of service. It is now unreliable and I need a replacement suggestion. Would like to go for 10G copper even though we have nothing with 10G just to be prepared. $2k budget each, 16 port or more. Nothing fancy. Don&#x27;t need managed/L3/redundant PSU/etc. Max switching traffic at full load would be 2Gbps/ea but backups never run during business hours so it&#x27;s unrealistic.
 I dug around for a bit. Is the Aruba 1960 any good for light iSCSI?

                              <span>Very simple question. Currently in my environment we have loopback address assigned to each our routes/switches and our routing protocol is BGP. It was my understanding that you want a loopback address to be passive. Is this only the case if you are using OSPF to form an adjacency with other device or is it best practice to do reguardless of the routing protocol?

                              <span>Recently just joined a medium/large business where the network is abit of a mess. The previous network team did little to no documentation. I&#x27;ve found myself reverse engineering everything by going through all the routing, vlans etc.
 For you seasoned architects and engineers. How would you go about gathering information regarding the topology, routing, documentation if this was you?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;m a network installer/CSR for a school campus. Long story short, I accidentally cut an underground 12 strand fiber and knocked down the network for several hours in the afternoon before we could get it back up 
 That happened yesterday and I&#x27;ve already had to fill out incident reports and get a good talking to from the higher ups of my job. I still feel like shit and am not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to keep my job after this.
 Have and of you guys been able to keep your job after screwing up like that?
 Update: thanks for all the responses! I&#x27;m feeling better about the whole situation now, we&#x27;re able to laugh about it more here at the office. I&#x27;m not gonna get fired and I&#x27;m definitely not gonna make the same mistake again lol

                              <span>Hey everyone.
 I&#x27;ve been googling around searching for what would be the most practical solution to monitor our 6 /24 segments but I haven&#x27;t found a definite answer. (We&#x27;re a new and kinda small ISP).
 I&#x27;ve already set up a remote server that is monitoring these segments with Smokeping, but now we need a way to monitor them locally.
 I haven&#x27;t found any info indicating that you can configure Smokeping to use a different interface or to ping with all interfaces, so, the faster solution would be to set up one Smokeping instance per each of our segments?
 Does anyone know a tool or service that could do this?
 Sorry if my English is a bit clunky, it is not my first language.
 Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: I just need basic ping and packet loss monitoring, like ping to Google, AWS, Netflix, Facebook, etc.
 nothing more at the moment.

 I don&#x27;t have any prior experience with Crown Castle, can someone chime in? How is their fiber DIA?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a problem with Azure Virtual WAN routing and was hoping somebody might have some insight. I also posted to /r/Azure but did not get any replies.
 For testing, I have created a network described by the network diagram at https://imgur.com/a/Yf0INds . In my scenario, I am creating a traffic flow from VNet_1 to 10.200.0.10. BGP is used between the VPN Branches and the VirtualHubs.
  
At first, the traffic flow uses path 1. This is expected.
 If path 1 becomes unavailable then the traffic flow uses path 2. This is expected.
 If path 1 recovers then the traffic flow continues to use path 2. This is not expected.
  
My expectations are mostly based on the routing scenarios from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference . My understanding is that path 1 should always be preferred if it is available because the Virtual Hub will prefer a directly connected route over a route from a remote hub. I would at least expect the routing decision to be deterministic.

                              <span>When deploying a firewall in a datacenter or even at an office (around 300 people or so), do you put the layer 3 for the lans on the firewall or keep it on the switches but still have the firewall learn all the VLANs downstream?
 I am wondering if there is best practice when it comes to firewall deployment or is it whatever makes sense to you.
 For much smaller deployments, such as an office with 100 users or less, to me, it makes sense to just terminate on the firewall but then again im not concerned so much about the inter-vlan traffic and the firewall policies are a bit more lax compared to a datacenter rollout.

                              <span>Looking for advice on how to resolve this dilemma, and thought it best to include a diagram that shows the current topology:
 https://i.imgur.com/Id3NwcL.png
 I recently added a second nexus to our core. For WAN connectivity, we have one MPLS link from the carrier plugged into the original Nexus. This nexus is learning the BGP routes from our remote sites just fine.
 The second Nexus, however, is not. Instead, it is learning the routes from the firewall via OSPF, as each site has a VPN tunnel to the firewall as a backup WAN connection.
 Is it possible for nexus2 to receieve the BGP routes from nexus1 in the short term? Ideally, we would get a second drop from the carrier to have an uplink in nexus2, and they could also establish it as a bgp peer.
 Otherwise, what are my options?
 I could add static routes for each remote subnet on nexus2, but that doesn&#x27;t seem ideal, either.
 Right now, the bgp config on nexus1 is as follows:
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/24 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 address-family ipv4 unicast soft-reconfiguration inbound always 
 And Nexus2, I configured bgp in case I ever needed to physically move the MPLS cable over.
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/16 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 update-source Vlan999 address-family ipv4 unicast prefix-list no-default-route in router ospf 1 redistribute bgp 999 route-map MPLS passive-interface default redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS route-map MPLS permit 10 match route-type external internal

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently just messing around with some network traffic of an infusion pump and it&#x27;s connection with the online configurator. The two are exchanging their communication via TCP. 
 I also did a vulnerability scan using GVM/OpenVAS and found out that the infusion pump is using an old/deprecated version of TLS (version 1.0).
 Now the data that is being exchanged is send in plain text (also a lot of sensitive data) despite TLS.
 I&#x27;m kinda new to networking and the whole security aspect that does with it so excuse my ignorance. However, shouldn&#x27;t the data be encrypted in some sort because of the TLS that is implemented? The way i understand TLS is that the data is being encrypted right before it is being send over the TCP-Stream and then again decrypted at the destination.
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I have multiple ACLs for each port that replace the dot1p value based on the VLAN ID, e.g.:
 entry P1_MCAST_V111 { if { vlan-id 111; } then { permit; replace-dot1p-value 4; } } 
 Recently I created a link aggregation group consisting of two ports. According to the docs, VLANs should be assigned only to the master port, but what about access lists? Should they also be assigned only to the master port or to both the slave and the master?

                              <span>Hi, so besides Draw.io or Visio, what tools do people use?
 I&#x27;ve tried using Visio and it&#x27;s fine but I feel like the diagrams just aren&#x27;t as professional compared to some of the diagrams you lookup or see elsewhere.
 I&#x27;ve heard that MAC&#x27;s have great tools for network documentation but sadly I&#x27;ve never used a MAC.
 If you could list your top 3 best network documentation tools you use, what would they be?
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m a bit of a beginner so was hoping to get some pointers on how to achieve the below please. Apologies if my question appears ignorant. Any input at all would be greatly appreciated.
 I am looking for a way to streamline some aspects of my job by doing some remote commissioning of PLCs, BACnet gateways, Modbus devices etc.
 While I am completing these works at the moment, the site is typically under construction, so there is no internet access or core switch operational. I have to manually plug into network switches around the the site and configure devices that way.
 I have got my hands on a cellular 3G router and have got it configured so I can use it to remotely connect to a site PC via RDP and use that for remote commissioning.
 What I would like to achieve is being able to plug this 3G router in to any isolated network switch on site and be able to connect to and pull data from devices such as the PLCs and gateways dynamically and communicate with a remote PC rather than a local RDP.
 Ideal setup would be:
  
Remote PC at home (192.168.xxx.xxx)
 3G router plugged into switch on site (10.10.xxx.xxx)
 Applications on Remote PC at home able to communicate with IP devices plugged in to network switch on site (For example opening my PLC configuration program and plugging in the 10.10.xxx.xxx IP Address to be able to configure it remotely.
  
I have got the dynamic DNS side of things working and am aware I can set up specific connections via port forwarding, but I am looking for a more dynamic solution where someone on site can plug this router into any switch on site and I will be able to talk to any of the 10.10.xxx.xxx devices dynamically without having to set up dedicated port forwarding for each unique IP address.
 Is a solution like this feasible, or should I continue with the site laptop/3G router combo I am currently using for remote access via RDP?
 Appreciate your time and input.

                              <span>Is it normal for enterprise sized companies 10k+ employees , 300+ IT staff not to have IT project managers? 
 I work in a 50,000+ employee company with projects galore and no IT project managers. Each IT person has projects where they are the lead on. I personally have 10 large projects to manage and it’s chaos. I get constantly pulled into other peoples project meetings while trying to pull what ever resources I can into my projects. This leads to a stupid amount of unproductive meetings, no ownership, and nothing getting done. 
 I’ve told my managers they need to get some project managers on board, but am met with looks of bewilderment. Is this standard operating procedure at most large organizations?

                              <span>Holy hell... Does it take anyone else nearly an hour after ending the work day to stop racing? I feel like I&#x27;m in this never ending loop of a constant barrage of user issues that result in derailing my entire week. 
 What does everyone do to minimize lost time on BS user issues? I feel like my important tasks are always put on the back burner due to the constant interruptions. 
 I&#x27;m a one man show. I do have the support of a MSP available and their usage approved, but is that additional expense warranted? It&#x27;s a small company but I&#x27;m managing their entire tech stack. So far I haven&#x27;t used the MSP for the help desk. Should I start? 
 I&#x27;m trying to juggle important changes to systems that will impact the efficiencies elsewhere in the organization but I end up spending my day diagnosing a printer that a user disconnected. WTH?

 Make sure you enter SLA request tickets as if you experienced this. That broke their SLA, and here&#x27;s the downtime description, &quot;Downtime: Any period of time when end users are unable to see presence status, conduct instant messaging conversations, or initiate online meetings.&quot; 
 As of this writing we&#x27;re at about 99.35 (which is less than 99.9%) - so we&#x27;re at 25% service credit but if they hit 99% that&#x27;s 50% service credit.

I thought that was some funny as shit. I personally don&#x27;t use Mechanical keyboards and I don&#x27;t get the fascination with them, I used them throughout my childhood and just don&#x27;t care for them as an adult, I just want something that works ... even for gaming I don&#x27;t see the necessity but whatever. I just wanted to share a funny work place story that happened today!

                              <span>This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m happy.
 We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it&#x27;s a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he&#x27;s giving me a 5, and they just say &quot;We&#x27;re good with that. Who&#x27;s next.&quot;
 After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.
 Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don&#x27;t want to deal with it in the morning.
 So, in a month, I don&#x27;t work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I&#x27;ll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.
 So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it&#x27;s really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you&#x27;ll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you&#x27;re everyone&#x27;s hero. And they&#x27;ll remember you&#x27;re the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.
 It&#x27;s good to be recognized sometimes.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve recently deployed Ubiquity Dream Machines at one of the locations I&#x27;m responsible for, and among other websites they want to see blocked, TikTok and 4chan are at the top. 
 Despite entering domain names, and in the case of TikTok, all of the many IP addresses, it still seems accessible. Even the &quot;Social Media&quot; catch all option is not blocking it in the Traffic Management section. 
 Does anyone else have any experience or ideas on how to do this? The domains and IPs suggested online haven&#x27;t been useful. I&#x27;m at the point where I will have to purchase additional software like openDNS, which is fine if that&#x27;s what is necessary, but I was hoping to avoid.

 According to the article, someone &#x27;high up&#x27; clicked on a bad link and it led to everything from their backups to payroll, scheduling, inventory, ordering and many other systems all being compromised. They also lost patient pharmaceutical info to the attackers.
 For this to be true it means a number of the most basic industry standard security practices were not followed, like:
  
MFA/Conditional access on remote access to email, VPN, RDP, etc...
 No separation of regular user accounts from admin, server and domain admin accounts
 Backups not immutable or air gapped
 Likely no &#x27;next gen&#x27; firewall UTM monitoring internal servers
  
It also just seems crazy to me that so many systems could be accessible from a single user credential. This is a company that had $30 billion+ in sales last year.

 I’m writing a resume for an AD specialist position and it’s crazy to list and remember all the big and small projects across my 20 in the business.

                              <span>So I am an intern, this is my first IT job. My ticket was migrating our email gateway away from going through Sophos Security to now use native Defender for Office because we upgraded our MS365 License. Ok cool. I change the MX Records in our multiple DNS Providers, Change TXT Records at our SPF tool, great. Now Email shouldn&#x27;t go through Sophos anymore. Send a test mail from my private Gmail to all our domains, all arrive, check message trace, good, no sign of going through Sophos. 
 Now im deleting our domains in Sophos, delete the Message Flow Rule, delete the Sophos Apps in AAD. Everything seems to work. Four hours later, I&#x27;m testing around with OME encryption rules and send an email from the domain to my private Gmail. Nothing arrives. Fuck. 
 I tested external -&gt; internal and internal -&gt; internal, but didn&#x27;t test internal-&gt; external. Message trace reveals it still goes through the Sophos Connector, which I forgot to delete, that is pointing now into nothing. 
 Deleted the connector, it&#x27;s working now. Used Message trace to find all mails in our Org that didn&#x27;t go through and individually PMed them telling them to send it again. It was a virtual walk of shame. Hope I&#x27;m not getting fired.

                              <span>Right now we have identified many different scripting/coding methods being used to automate processes like reporting, database updates, account modifications, SharePoint updates, and much more. Things like PowerShell (.ps1), Batch files (.bat/.cmd), Shell scripts (.sh), Perl scripts (.pl), Autohotkey scripts (.ahk), Python (.py), complex Excel/Access creations, SharePoint forms/automations, and custom executables from god knows where (.exe).
 Everyone who came before was handed multiple jobs to complete, as their peers left the company. And they managed to do it. They automated it to make it possible. But then they were poorly compensated. No raises, or even pay cuts. CEO makes 2 mil, yet they get dropped from 100k to 70k to make it happen. So they left. Now the company is relying on this automation, but it keeps breaking. Nobody has expertise to deal with so many different cobbled together pieces. They basically eliminated 20+ jobs through automation, then let the people behind all this stuff walk. We&#x27;re not even sure which servers it&#x27;s all running on (dozens of them at least).
 Any recommendations for dealing with this stuff (other than leaving)?
 Any tools that can log all of this, and try to map out what everything is doing, and on what servers?

                              <span>Basically we have a web application that all of our suppliers log into and do certain things for us. All of a sudden last week something changed and our users are having difficulties logging in. They are getting all kinds of TLS and connection refused errors. It works intermittently but when they are able to log in, page elements don&#x27;t load, it says quotes are submitted when they actually aren&#x27;t.
 It&#x27;s extremely old obviously, it can only run in edge on compatibility mode now, it was originally designed for Internet explorer. The kicker is that there&#x27;s been no maintenance paid on this and it cannot be updated without that maintenance, and the person who created it left the company 10 years before I joined. I asked around and there&#x27;s nobody that supports this app nor has there been anybody since the man who created it left supporting it.
 Now I have procurement beating down my door in a panic because nobody can do what they need to do. I told them I have no knowledge of this and that the solution is to cough up the maintenance to get this working but I was told that isn&#x27;t an option. My job duties do not include application support. I am a systems administrator. 
 I&#x27;m all for helping out where I can but what do I do?

                              <span>They have altered the file naming in AppData/Roaming. A template named head.office used to get you files named head.office_files, head_office.htm, head.office.rtf, head.office.txt 
 If your template or signature is still named head.office, the associated files now have the user appended ... head_office (user@domain.tld)_files, head_office (user@domain.tld).htm, etc ....
 Hopefully this means they are progressing with server-wide signatures (once for all devices).

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a way to sign subdomains as well with the same key?
 Ie.:
 foo.com
 *.foo.com
 I can&#x27;t find out how to do it and I&#x27;m starting to believe it&#x27;s just not possible.
 We just can&#x27;t set &quot;Domain&quot; parameter in opendkim.conf because we are sending emails with hunderds if not thousands of domains.
 rspamd is not an option because it&#x27;s too heavy weight (slows down the mail delivery singificantly at this scale of emails).

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Every couple of months we need to update some image files on 150 remote windows machines (not on the company network). Right now we have been doing it manually: using TeamViewer or VNC to remote into the machine and transfer the files. Is there any tool/software that can allow me to script the entire process so we don&#x27;t have to do this anymore? Thanks!

                              <span>So I had an interview with a recruitment agency today, was a general chat with the usual personality questions, from the junior consultant girl. Followed up with some more technical networking/infra questions from the senior interviewer. 
 Long story short, the senior said she&#x27;s probably got something VMWare lined up with a 3-6 month contract, and will called back tomorrow with a series of technical questions. I am a systems/network administrator with proficient L1-L2 experience, and even build servers both physical and virtual from the ground up, utilizing technologies such as Hyper-V and VMware on the occasional blue moon, or when the need arises. I have been doing this for roughly 10 years. 
 Now I understand while the market is pretty good for IT jobs at the moment, I can&#x27;t seem to get over the fact, that all these high level engineering questions get thrown at you, or something that is super specific to the business. Half the time it&#x27;s not even listed on the job advert and here I am thinking yep, a suitable sysadmin role only to be thrown curveball after curveball of things non related to original advert, or what&#x27;s listed on my resumé.
 Does anyone else experience these sorts of things in the application process and what sort of questions should I expect tomorrow? She knows I&#x27;m not VMWare certified but still stated that an 80% success on the questions will land me the job!!! 80%!!!

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 My environment consists of ten terminals and two file servers in different sites.
 The file server consists of drives:
 D-data
 P - fslogix profiles disks
 L - logs for storage replica
 All on OS server 2019
 ​
 During business hours I ran the test-srtopology command and then the entire network was disabled.
 I guess it happened during the ICMP traffic test or during perfomance tests.
 I honestly couldn&#x27;t find and understand why it affected the entry to the terminals.
 Because I performed the replication in general on a different drive from the profiles, I ran the test and the command on drive D.
 The logic says that there is no effect on the function but the facts show that the problem started close to the time I was working on the file server with the command I explained earlier.
 And the problem was solved when it was over.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help in understanding this, what was the problem?
 And is the storage replica solution suitable for file servers with a function like mine.
 Drive D contains regular files and documents.
 ​
 Thank you!

Providing a user with delegate access using Powershell and the cmdlet SharingPermissonFlags is straight forward enough, the issue is then removing those permissions consistently. Getting access to a VIP&#x27;s Outlook profile to remove delegate access manually isn&#x27;t always convenient. Is there a way of removing delegate permissions through poweshell, so that the delegate no longer receives calendar invites?

                              <span>Hi all,
 The short text on this post is that I&#x27;ve been exploring backup options, we&#x27;re currently an Acronis house for on-prem backups, and I&#x27;ve lost the will to live looking at a 300% jump in costs if we want to implement backups for the ~8TB data we have in 365 through mailboxes, SharePoint and OneDrive. 
 We&#x27;re a nonprofit, and our 1.5 FTE staff in IT are supported by an MSP who want to resell us Veeam. We have Synology NAS for storing VM and database backups, distributed across 4 sites. I&#x27;m told the Synology 365 solution sucks but it&#x27;s basically free. I want to save £5k a year by using it anyway. I&#x27;m looking for more impartial opinions than I&#x27;ve been given so far.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>working for a small start up company with about 130 users. 
 Main problem i am faced with currently is tidying up the current AAD estate. 
 All applications are assigned directly to users in AAD rather than through groups, the problem i currently have is; 
 I want to assign applications through groups such as (Core Apps, Engineering, QA, Customer Ops) groups based on departments/roles within the business which will help in me automating application access. 
 My main concern currently is all the applications assigned directly to existing users, I wanted to avoid doubling up giving access but I&#x27;m struggling to think of a way to put everyone into groups, giving them the access they need and not creating duplicates. 
 Of course there&#x27;s the manual route which I&#x27;m happy to do but will be kicking myself if there&#x27;s an easier way to do it and i find out after. 
 Any advice or comments on me being an idiot are fully welcomed :&#x27;)

 I know some people will defend the foreman with their live, but lets be honest:
 The thing is constantly broken. I tried using rhel sattelite, but I don&#x27;t want to buy a new license this year.
 Does anyone know a working alternative (preferable with a gui)? I want to auto-create a VM on my vmware infra structure and deploy an OS

 I.e. would you gift their laptops or pick them up? How would you pick them up if mainly remote employees? If gifted, what are the security risks? I know so many people who were left with blank, locked/unusable new laptops when they left their company. Seems such a waste, especially given the supply issues atm. 
 I’m new to all this, so I’d love to have some ideas in my back pocket just in case something like this were to happen at my company.

 How about daily standup meetings where you are going to discuss your projected work for the day?
 Trying to better understand who else deals with this shit.. I’ve been in my company for years and we have gotten more and more “transparent” with our work, as they like to call it.
 I am salaried.

                              <span>Hi guys, we&#x27;ve got a Ruckus Virtual SmartZone Essentials box and for staff/student WIFI we use Radius to authenticate with a DC NPS server which then assigns a VLAN to route through the appropriate filter on our Sophos XGS.
 It works, but is a nasty experience, especially on Android where the user has to choose encryption type (LEAP, PEAP etc) and certificate - with Google Pixel not working at all. On desktop and Apple devices it&#x27;s tidier just taking the username and password.
 I&#x27;m being sold CloudPath as a solution but I just can&#x27;t wrap my head around why I need an extra product.
 I&#x27;ve managed to get a landing page to authenticate to AD which works OK, except for all the certificate errors for the Ruckus landing page and then for XGS.
 Anyone got an idiots guide on how to improve this or am I going to have to fork out for a proper onboarding solution?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Our Commvault 5 year deal is coming to an end.
 I&#x27;m not in that company so ling, so I inherited it with the job.
 It&#x27;s going to end in about 5 months and I was considering my options.
 I&#x27;ve been working with veeam before, so I am familiar with it, but also considering 2 more vendors, veratis and rubrik.
 I was wondering if anyone can offer some technical tips in 2 scopes:
  
Things to check when look for a solution, like deduplication and encryption for example 
 
Comparison with the vendors I mentioned from your experience. 
 
 My current setting in comvault is with a dell scv2020 and a server connecting the storge (called media agent).
 For comvault renewal I&#x27;ve been notified the server won&#x27;t be needed anymore but the storage is out of service.
 I can get 3rd party support for the storage, using it for a few more years and saving costs but I understand other vendors has their own appliances with internal storage and such, that will probably cost more to implement then using the storage I have now.
 I mostly backup DB, important data server and our vcenter.
 Also backing up to cloud, using metallic. 
 Any advises?

 I work at an org that has windows hello / face ID enabled for log in. This is causing a nightmare for the service desk because end users keep forgetting their password as face ID is just too convenient...
 Is there any sort of group policy or other setting we can change so our devices forcefully require the password to be entered once every 10 log ins instead of face ID?
 Cheers

                              <span>I’ve always loved linux and networking since I was a kid in highschool. My greatest project at that time was putting msfconsole on a jailbroken iPad mini. This project took me 2 weeks to complete (slacked off about half those days) but once finished it gave me biggest rush to see msfconsole load up, even if I did absolutely nothing with it. I knew I had to do this for a living. 
 fast forward, graduate college with a BS associates in computer programing because I hate school and couldn’t beat another 2 years. Finally get my degree at 20 and what do I do with it? Nothing. For 3 years. Since out of highschool I worked BS manual labor jobs. I always knew I wanted more, but didn’t think my degree would get me anything. Until 6 months ago. 
 Now, by pure luck, I’m a tier 1 sysadmin (skipped help desk completely) at a VoIP company, writing a script to fully automate the setup of a wireless modem in a fanless PC, to cut a two box implementation down to 1, and simplify the process for those who need to install the equipment. 
 Pinch me I’m dreaming. 
 There’s nothing like the feeling of rebooting a device, watching your logs show you over and over again a successful setup, and knowing the months it took to make this happen resulted in a (somewhat) stable configuration.

                              <span>I know what some might say right away, imposter syndrome, etc, and there might be some of that.
 But in other real ways I’m not good enough at my job and it’s hurting me, hurting the clients, and hurting the customers.
 There’s really two problems: one is that I’m tech-savvy and have a real knack for this stuff, but past a certain level of technical difficulty and outside of a certain level of emergency I lose focus and falter in knowledge. Like, if the server is down right now, I can figure outa way to get it back up. I might not be able to articulate how, but I’ll get it running again. But ask me to troubleshoot what happened after the fact and I’ll flounder. Similarly if you give me a bunch of machines and an end result, I can get them running… but are they configured correctly, or do they just “kinda work”?
 The second is I really have a hard time working hard enough or doing the work I need to be doing. If I don’t have a person calling now, I try to go to my ticket queue, and I can sit and stare at tickets or click in and out of them multiple times without doing anything. And that’s if I don’t give in to the temptation do something else entirely. I’ve blocked Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook on work computers during the day, and it helps, but I can still find ways to not do work. I have things that sit in a queue for days or weeks because I get so anxious I avoid them until I can’t any longer.
 I’m failing the rest of my team, and I feel like shit all the time about it. And that just makes it worse.
 I think about jumping ship to another job, but I actually like the company and people I work for, and I know it would only help for six months to a year, and I’d be right back where I started.
 I don’t know, this may not be the place to talk about this, this is less a technical conversation than maybe mental health mixed with discipline, but maybe some of you have some advice to help me get back on track.

                              <span>I was using explorer patcher to move my taskbar to top successfully before 22H2. But yesterday my computer got updated and the taskbar went back down. So, I tried a bunch of stuff until I managed to get it back on top and, as I found this instruction nowhere, I share here in case someone needs it.
 The difference between this solution and the regular instruction I found around the internet is that they all suggest editing values of a &quot;MMStuckRects3&quot; key, which was working for me before 22H2, but not anymore. The hack is to add a new REG_BINARY to the registry key below (create if does not exist):
 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MMStuckRectsLegacy]
 The name of this new value must be the device instance path (second property when navigating to Devices Manager &gt; Monitors &gt; (target monitor name) &gt; Properties &gt; Device Instance Path). Get everything after &quot;DISPLAY\&quot; and replace the other &quot;\&quot; by &quot;#&quot;, such as:
  
Device Instance Path: DISPLAY\PHLC056\5&amp;3C07B47&amp;0&amp;UID266
 Registry key name: PHLC056#5&amp;3c07b47&amp;0&amp;UID266 (letters in lower case between # and &amp;UID)
  
Using this as the name of the value, enter the following binary value:
 30 00 00 00 fe ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 3e 00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
 Restart explorer.exe or sign out/in and the second monitor taskbar should be at the top.
 Hope it helps!

                              <span>Heading to work, got a call from boss, couple clients down, they can&#x27;t connect to data center. So I head straight there. 
 Checked firewall it&#x27;s online. Connect to win server, can&#x27;t login, that&#x27;s weird i thought to myself. Decide to login to hypervisor instead from my laptop, sees clients vm offline, tries to boot one, says cannot locate vm disk, my eyes bulge. At that point I&#x27;m like WTF. I browser to the location of the disk.... Everything encrypted with ransomware. My heart skips a beat and i nearly stumble. No worries, i told myself, I&#x27;ll just fire up the replicas on the backup and everyone back up.....WTF replica encrypted too. Dig deeper, entire datacenter compromised. 
 Esxi + ransomware &#x3D; how da hell that happen? Stuff like that will make a grown man want to cry. I literally have sleepless night and when i do sleep it give me nightmares

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a one man shop, size is not huge, but pace of company, red tape, etc make it a huge workload which I personally feel we need at least 3 people, but that&#x27;s a different story.
 The CFO is the one directly over my purchases.
 They&#x27;ve been on a hiring spree, like 10 people a month, but I feel there is very little communication between HR and them and most departments or they&#x27;re too busy to pay attention to what&#x27;s going on.
 So every time I make a purchase of those 10 laptops ahead of time, I&#x27;m given a very hard time and the CFO&#x27;s attitude acts like I&#x27;m just shopping or hoarding, or maybe worse, stealing. So I tell him about all these new hires, and they keep coming and he always gives me a hard time.
 This is in addition to equipment that needs to be refreshed or fails. He gives me such…</span>

                              <span>I have two industrial machines that communicate via broadcast and multicast traffic. 
 I&#x27;m trying to block a set of ports and multicast addresses while keeping the other broadcast and multicast features working. 
 So far the devices I have laying around will only apply the firewall on routed traffic, not touching the devices on the same network.
 Looking for a recommendation on a device. Hoping to avoid a micro PC with two network ports: our setup is portable, people tend to yank power before worrying about shutdown sequences.
 Details:
 Broadcast is used for detection then multicast for actual communication, so both machines need to be on the same LAN to play nicely.
 They also use two realtime communication protocols at the same time, one protocol is nice and efficient, and the other one tries to hog the entire link to itself. The nice protocol uses IGMPv2 and the 236.0.0.0 range, the other protocol is a blackbox but uses 239.0.0.0 and opens ports 30000 thru 30007. I think if I could drop 239.0.0.0 and the associated ports I could solve my issues.
 I&#x27;m trying to add Point 2 Point wireless for long range comms using the lightweight protocol, but the heavyweight protocol seems to saturate the wireless bridge and the lightweight protocol can&#x27;t connect. Everything works OK enough with Wifi 6 links, but I&#x27;m trying for hundreds of feet in a noisy environment, with TP Link P2P or Ubiquiti P2P limited to their 100Mbps ports. Upgrading to the 5ghz P2P stuff seems like kicking the can down the road, since at 15 feet away the heavyweight protocol is laggy over 802.11ax.
 Googling around brings me to articles about &quot;Packet Filtering Firewalls&quot;, but without naming any devices.

                              <span>A bit of background:
 I&#x27;m responsible for deploying Android-based devices in MDU/manufacturing/healthcare environments. Anywhere from 50 to over 1500 at a time. The process involves updating the device firmware and enrolling into an EMM/MDM of some sort. Because of the nature of the industry, a lot of the time we&#x27;re forced to use guest Wi-Fi networks or a mobile hotspot to do so, which means we&#x27;re limited to running 4-8 at a time, and even then, still run into issues that require a reset and re-enroll of the device.
 That said: here are the back-end requirements needed to complete these steps:
  
For the firmware updates, an HTTP/S server (apache, IIS, nginx, etc.) w/ relatively quick on-board storage (SATA SSD or PCIe NVMe).
 For Google services and EMM enrollment, a decent (unrestricted) pipe to the internet.
  
I&#x27;m thinking I can kill two birds with a single device, but I&#x27;ve yet to find something that supports the following:
  
Wifi 6 router supporting HTTP/S server functionality and
 Cellular WAN functionality (5G or LTE cat. 16 or better) OR
 the ability to authenticate via RADIUS to hotel landing pages that require a last name and room number, for example.
  
My initial thoughts are to go with an x86 appliance such as the FW6D from Protectli, though I wanted to get your thoughts before I made a decision. 
 Thanks in advance!!

 For example, if neighbor 10.10.10.10 send me the community string 5555:1, I want to prepend all routes to that neighbor with my AS.
 The use case is so that individual neighbors can influence the path they take to get to some shared network resources.

                              <span>Last couple jobs were at a large regional ISP. I mostly did the capacity maintenances for the edge aggregation routers to the core, via ROADM. I’d add and drop fiber links from the ring, add the configurations for the new interfaces in IOS-XR, write the MOP, sometimes order equipment and deploy it to a hub, and either ran the maintenance or scheduled it to a overnight guy to do for me. 
 I also did new turn-ups of E-BGP peers on the CRS-16, and helped manage the core route reflectors. We were first escalation for outages as well. 
 I left work for FMLA reasons and my confidence is low. Most jobs are enterprise and not sure what to expect really. It’s hard for me to remember some topics I knew inside and out. Managed primary the underlay transport but did some MPLS L2VPN, L3VPN, and VRF stuff for enterprise BGP peering.
 Anyone have any tricks or tips to quickly catch myself back up? I find re-reading material I’ve already read to be difficult. It’s like the information is in the back of my head and the moment I read it again it becomes boring.
 Also having trouble finding interviews. I used to get several lined up and competing offers. Barely even getting responses from company recruiters. Often passed up and never even spoken too.

 An interface in NetBox (our DCIM) is updated &gt; A webhook is sent to a server &gt; A script is executed with a number of details about the interface (access/voice/trunked, etc) which launches an Ansible playbook enacting the changes made in NetBox.
 It&#x27;s working decently, but I&#x27;ve ran into an issue. One of the plays is meant to configure an access and voice VLAN on an interface, but it appears to be executing the commands out of order. Specifically, I think it is trying to disable trunk encapsulation before setting the interface&#x27;s mode to access (this particular interface was set to trunk prior to trying to run this test). I&#x27;m…</span>

                              <span>I almost posted this in r/homenetworking because the needs are so basic. 
 My friend has asked me to recommend a router for his small business office. They only need it for delivering internet to their staff laptops. They don&#x27;t have an internal network/domain or anything. All of their HR and Scheduling they just use websites for and all storage is google cloud storage. 
 They have equipment from Cox but the router constantly drops connections and has a weak signal at the far end the building. And it seems to be limited to 10 connections simultaneously when there are generally about 15 to 18 people in the office at peak. 
 They&#x27;re just looking for something that&#x27;s fairly simple to setup/manage, can deliver solid speeds, and allow upwards of 20+ users simultaneously. 
 It almost seems like any basic router will do the job, but I think signal strength was my concern as the office isn&#x27;t HUGE, but their internet comes in in one corner of the building so the router will go there, and have to pass through many many walls to reach the offices at the opposite end. 
 Thanks for any recommendations
