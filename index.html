                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m helping a customer who currently has a NAS with a few network shared drives that are synced up to their respective sharepoint online communicationswebsites. The problem is that files are not synced down to the shared drive from sharepoint online, but files are uploaded automatically from the network drive to sharepoint online. 
 Is there anything to do about this, or would it be wiser to just close either sharepoint online or the network share down and tell the users to only use one of them?

 Obviously some time has passed, does this registry key still need applying to all servers via GPO or has some MS skullduggery happened under the hood and this is now fixed automagically?

I mainly act as a technical filter for a 200 personnel, resolving and escalating issues that are out of my knowledge.
 Just yesterday, the CEO asked me to carwash his new car, am I supposed to do that even though it&#x27;s not part of my duties. I feel that I am being reduced and humiliated. Yes I am just a graduate, a graduate with speech disability who&#x27;s determine to work and succeed in IT. 
 Please advise on what should I do. Is it right or legal for them to do that, our organization doesn&#x27;t have union so can&#x27;t have any support for question. This is a family business.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have come across a problem I am trying to solve and am completely stumped by it. 
 Our estate is mostly Windows 10 ent 21H1. We have had multiple users report that our IT service desk webpage keeps opening itself randomly. 
 This morning, I went to see a user and do some digging. In front of me she started typing an email, pressed shift+A and the IT helpdesk web page opened. She closed it, and then went back to her email and pressed shift+A and the helpdesk did not open. Each user reporting the issue says the same thing. There is no consistency as to when it does it or what key combination causes it. 
 I have searched the registry for the domain of the helpdesk without the https:// or trailing slashes and nothing came up.
 I have checked all desktop shortcuts for keyboard shortcuts on the helpdesk shortcut, but the user did not even have any shortcuts to the helpdesk in their profile anywhere. 
 The user I was with went off on the ward to sort some bits out whilst I dug into the issue, and I asked the other user in the room if they had the same and they said they have had it happen randomly to. It happens on different computers and it does not matter if they use the ward generic account or their account, it happens either way. 
 ​
 Has anyone come across this or got any ideas as to where else I can have a look? The bit that has thrown me off is the keyboard combination that triggers it is not static. I am sure I have had this happen to myself as well.
 Thanks!

 At 10:16AM yesterday my vmware servers flagged both my domain controllers as red for CPU usage. First it was both DCs, i struggled my way around the first DC trying to find anything that was wrong, i couldn&#x27;t find any answers, so i restarted it. This resolved the issue on what i&#x27;ll call DC1, however DC2 stayed at 100% and was now practically unusable, it eventually took about an hour to restart DC2. 
 As soon as DC2 went offline, DC1 cpu usage on the LSASS service shot up to 100%, specifically the KDC process. 
 I could repeat that process and the 100% cpu usage would move back and forth. If i le…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys
 So is exactly what the title says. This company took a dip in terms of not having their shit together on the customer care side of things as the person that was previously there fucked up bad (that was said to me in my 2nd interview) so now they want someone who will clearly know how to do the following :
  
Create an easy way of managing tickets
 
Create Documentation on what to do for each situation step by step (with flow charts of business processes if I can) and SOPS (standards operating procedures) 
 
Further refine their FAQs (so as to lower users logging tickets when they can just troubleshoot themselves &amp; find a fix that way too instead of creating extra tickets.
 
Know how to utilize SharePoint in creating Response Templates
 
 In their words they simply want it to be a specific way that if 2 New people had to join the company under me, all I would have to do instead of helicopter-ing around them, is literally show them this system of documented procedures and what processes to follow in order to know what to say and who to go to for what information.
 I&#x27;m freaking out because whilst I have managed teams before I have never had to create any processes and document stuff.
  
Are there any easy Softwares out there to automate Documenting procedures and processes or make this easy to do (free ideally)? 
 
Are their any easy resources to easily learn how to create or custom make SharePoint into a central point of information? 
 
How do I wing this post? Any words of encouragement will be really welcomed, I can feel the imposter syndrome tingling lol
 
 Any and all advice is welcomed too! 
 Thank you so much for reading! 
 I will reply as soon as I get a chance!

                              <span>My business asked me to create and develop a new Microsoft system which usually requires a Microsoft partner to integrate and lots of money. 
 I went away learnt the system, created multiple integrations with dashboards and workflows and mimic their current system they used so that everything looked similar. 
 I’ve had no support in building it out as they did not want to spend the money. I created a bunch of processes that are connected to the new system which have been successful. 
 I eventually rolled the system out to the whole business, I was task to train 100 people individually, and also teach the internal staff how to use the system. 
 The business has now done a backflip on their decision and realised that the usability of it is too complex and is wanting to pull the project. 
 When I rolled out the project two weeks after I was given multiple project leads that the business deemed important. I felt that during that time I was not able to give the respect my work deserved over the last 12 months. 
 The company realised they have under resource me, but now I feel like the last 12 months have been a complete waste of time. I feel like I’ve been set up to fail. 
 Don’t get me wrong I learnt a lot of stuff. But now almost all of it won’t come to fruition because they’ve decided this is not the right direction for the business after launch. 
 Any advice? Has anyone else been through something like this?

                              <span>Hi fellow IT Experts,
 ​
 In a Company i Support we get some really strange errors from our clients.
 Suddenly after a restart the Search bar and the Windows Start ( Logo) wont work or is not clickable anymore. I cant see any point that triggers this behavior ( Updates or so ) . These Notebooks are Intune controlled. All are rolled out on the same profile. 
 In the last 6 month we hat like 6 Clients with this problem . If you log in with another account on the same machine everything works fine. The only solution to it by now is to clean reinstall Windows.
 Does anyone had/has the same issue or maby knows a fix to this ? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I want to connect to small datacenters in the same building (100 metres), it will be use to connect switches, server, storage (10G, 25G, 40G, 100G). My idea is to pass SMF and MMF , so I can use what I want later. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with fiber, so please correct me if I am wrong. My idea is:
 - 1 patch panel 48 ports LC SMF OS2 UPC in each datacenter
 - 1 patch panel 48 ports LC MMF OM4 UPC in each datacenter
 Do I have to cross the connections? or is it better to cross the patch cable in one side?
 If I have to use MPO connectors for 40G or 100G over MMF, are they compatible with LC patch panels?
 UPC or PC?
 Thanks

                              <span>I have limited experience in networking and would love some help in better understanding the best way to do this. I plan to eventually hire to have this work done, but I really hate being that guy who doesn&#x27;t understand what he&#x27;s asking others to do.
 (Diagram) In our network we have two facilities and a fist full of remote cabinets. Every cabinet has a link to each facility, and both facilities have a connection to each other. Each facility has its own connection to a separate carrier and we have one ASN. The traffic originating from these cabinets must reliably make their way to the internet, with the key risk being a link from cabinet to one facility going down.
 Me, a caveman, thinks I should spec out the high level as:
  
Install layer 3 switches in the cabinets and facilities. Set up RIP.
 Install BGP routers at the facilities, set up VRRP and BGP.
  
Is this the right mindset? Are there smarter ways to handle this?

                              <span>The conventional recommendation I&#x27;ve seen around these parts for years essentially boils down to &quot;if you can afford a PAN firewall that gives you enough bandwidth for your needs, go with that; otherwise, go with a FortiGate&quot;. Obviously the two vendors are wildly different when you look at price-for-performance... but taking price out of the equation, why is it that we generally prefer Palo Alto around these parts?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I currently have to buildings that I am trying to bridge with a P2P wireless network ( 50 meters ). Both sites are running their network without any current VLANS set. I am trying to work out how to get the default vlan on each site onto its on VLAN at the remote site so I can configure the WiFI Ap&#x27;s on each site to have a SSID for the other building.
 Site 1 Site 2 VLAN 1  VLAN 1000 VLAN 2000  VLAN 1
 I have managed switches at both sites. Ideally i would like to have an additional subnet at each site and route between the two locations but I am told one of the applications in use does not support server communication on a different subnet so I am stuck with a odd layer 2 stretch situation.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on how i should approach this?
 Thanks

                              <span>Have 2 pairs of n9ks connected over dark fiber. Ebgp underlay, running vxlan (primary data center to colo). Each pair in vpc.
 I want to connect another n9k (will eventually be another vpc pair but budget/ supply chain issues). The other n9k is at another data center (same company as colo, fiber exists between colo and let’s call it dc3).
 The 2 pairs are ebgp peered physically and ibgp peered between vpc members. 
 Plan was to use data center providers network between colo and dc3, add third n9k and have all 5 switches meshed in one /28 segment so we can run vxlan to the 3rd site. 
 As soon as the server provider started making changes to one leg of the fiber, all 4 existing n9k switches errored out UDLD. Ports wouldn’t come back up until the transceivers were physically disconnected and reconnected.
 Went all around the world with TAC. They blame the transceivers. Cisco branded ones are on the way and I intend to try again with the new ones; however, do I disable UDLD on the affected interfaces before I try it? These 2 diverse path runs connect the Colo back to hq and redistribute routes to eigrp to (a much larger networks core) and to the internet.

 I’m in a new environment where I’m looking to learn the high level principles regarding NSX/T.
 I’m not directly responsible for the provisioning, but I’d like to understand how it works at a high level.
 Would anyone have any recommendations for blogs or consolidated/summarizes documentation?
 I’m trying avoid reading through vendor configuration documentation - but not against it if that’s how it is.

 I am trying to perform an ISSU upgrade on a Nokia 7705 SAR 8, I follow all the steps in the manual but when I expect the secondary card to sync, nothing happens. It says the card down, if I reboot the main card the entire chassis reboots. If I look at details of card B it says operation failed, software version mismatch. Has anyone successfully done an ISSU upgrade? If so, any tips?

                              <span>Good day to you guys, I hope everyone of you is doing fine.
 By the way I need help in designing my Enterprise Company network using MPLS, I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have much experience with MPLS, but I know and understand some basic how MPLS works.
 Right now, I&#x27;m trying to find document about how to design the MPLS using Huawei technology, but It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come up with good explanation, it&#x27;s only showed the course which is too broad.
 I&#x27;m looking for documents, video with good practice with Designing MPLS inside Enterprise Network or Active/Active Datacenter with MPLS.
 ​
 Thanks, you in advance for all input and recommendation.
 Happy A Good Days to you all.

                              <span>Trying to make sense of a weird issue we’re seeing. A group of client machines reach out to a server on a TCP Port. The application recently stopped working, and analyzing the network traffic reveals that there is no response back from the server. Just seeing a multitude of SYNs from the clients, and never any SYN+ACK from the server.
 We set a SPAN up directly on the server’s ports and see the SYNs egressing towards the server, and no SYN+ACK ingressing, we effectively proved traffic is making it all the way to the server, and the server is not responding to the traffic.
 After a while the ticket comes back to us saying the app owner had a call with the support vendor and they found nothing wrong and wanted the network checked for blocks.
 Same situation on second look, all SYNs no responses. This time we did some troubleshooting on the server itself and NETSTAT showed an anomaly. It showed ESTABLISHED connections with all of the clients trying to reach it, on the port they’re sending on…
 How is this possible? For NETSTAT to show ESTABLISHED on a TCP connection, it means there had to be a 3-way handshake, right? Or will it show established just if it receives SYN and (thinks) it sent out SYN+ACK?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I got a troubleshooting case, where a new Juniper ELS switch replaces an old Cisco switch that connects to a Cisco 877 router.
 The traffic was not forwarded properly due to: - IP address of the SVI on the 877 is bound to the MAC address of its first interface (Fa0) - Both the Cisco switch and the new Juniper switch connects to the 877&#x27;s Fa2 port (cable swapping only) - The Cisco switch managed to learn the MAC address of the SVI - The Juniper switch only learned the MAC address of the real interface (Fa2), causing all possible ARP replies to and ARP requests for the 877&#x27;s SVI IP failed to be forwarded properly
 I have tried setting static MAC (of the SVI) on the Juniper&#x27;s port connecting to the 877, however the traffic still fails to flow.
 Have yet tried static ARP on the hosts behind the Juniper.
 What else should I consider in this case?
 
 One more thing I have tried, is that setting an IRB interface on the Juniper switch (192.0.2.3/24). Still results in a failure

 Provider 1 is giving us full routes, where Provider 2 is not. This makes all routes take provider 1 because of more specific routes. (This was done this way by my predecessor)
 The other day there was an upstream failure somewhere in provider 1. All traffic to/from internet were getting lost.
 All routes were advertised to us but getting lost a few hops down the road. Because link status and BGP statuses were good, traffic never failed to provider 2.
 I was curious about the best way to fixing this. I was thinking of using IP SLA monitoring, any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m very excited about the prospect, as there&#x27;s a lot on paper about it that I would enjoy. But I&#x27;m wondering what it&#x27;s actually like from those who&#x27;ve done it before.
 From what it was explained to me, the job would involve a lot of meeting with c-level management and senior technical members of the customer&#x27;s network team, helping to understand their environment and making recommendations/designs of how a specific vendor&#x27;s product would help. I&#x27;d also then be responsible for creating and giving presentations about what our recommendations are, creating detailed designs and implementation plans and then be the primary technical POC during proof-of-concept implementations. There would be lots of client interaction, lots of face time, and at least 20% travel with the rest being fully remote. Lots of creating documentation &amp; designs, and then sometimes assisting (at a high level) with implementation.
 All of this sounds great to me, at least on paper. It&#x27;s the stuff that I love doing, without as much of the drudgery of day-to-day tickets. I spend my entire day already elbow-deep in this specific vendors products anyway, so if anything I&#x27;d have to go even deeper into their product offerings across the board.
 The compensation numbers being tossed about are . . . uh, generous to say the least. And that doesn&#x27;t hurt the appeal.
 My questions are:
 1. What are these jobs actually like, and what makes someone good at them? 2. What&#x27;s the best way to communicate my soft/non-technical abilities that I think would make me really good at this, such as being a good presenter, public speaker, and explainer of technical topics, without sounding like a blow-hard?

                              <span>I have a guy that connects to a meraki client VPN - once he connects he&#x27;s had all sorts of strange issues. To start out, and it might be the issue, whoever setup this network set it in a public range. 192.158.x.x
 Once he connects, he can ping the servers ip address and it gets a response (192.158.x.9) but he cannot Telnet to the same address.
 I&#x27;m on his home computer remotely, once he connects to the VPN, i lose my connection and don&#x27;t get it back until he disconnects. He also can&#x27;t get to the website to initiate a new connection but CAN still connect to other things on the internet.
 I ran wireshark on the server and can see the ping requests and replies but I see NOTHING when attempted a telnet connection. I&#x27;ve completely turned off the firewall on both machines to see if thats the issue, and it didn&#x27;t help. 
 a &quot;powershell test-netconnection&quot; to the server on port 23 fails
 I&#x27;ve connected to his VPN using the same settings from my computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.
 I&#x27;ve connected to his VPN using the same settings from his old home computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.
 I&#x27;ve restarted and ran windows updates and it still doesn&#x27;t work. I checked the firewall rules on the meraki and its set to allow all. There are some OLD 1:1 nat rules having to do with port 23 but that shouldn&#x27;t have anything to do with a vpn connection.
 ​
 I&#x27;m stumped. I don&#x27;t know why this machine wont work and a machine on the same home network works fine connecting the same way. I&#x27;ve spent 4 hours on this so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve missed some things in this write up

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with changing our Wi-Fi authentication method from username and password to device certificate-based authentication, using DigiCert as our certificate issuing service. I&#x27;ve added the DigiCert root and issuer certificates to our NPS server, created the RADIUS client and connection request policy, and set the network policy to use the NAS port wireless auth method EAP other certificate, and set the Issuer CA as the cert for the EAP. However, I&#x27;m currently struggling to find a guide on how to create a Wi-Fi profile on Windows 11 that will pass the correct device certificate to the AP and NPS servers. I&#x27;m also wondering how to maintain certain functionalities from the previous username and password authentication, such as the ability to place devices in different VLANs based on their Active Directory group membership. One suggestion I received was to use unique OUs in the certificate and have the NPS server validate and use these for network policies.

 I should be able to ping across the router right?

                              <span>Hi
 I have been advised that I need to implement port based security in a secure enclave, and recently got a Netgear M4300. 
 I have a L2 network with 8 clients and a management computer, and was hoping to achieve this just using mac address ACLS i.e. only the mac addresses of the existing machines connected to that L2 network can communicate, anything MAC not listed is dropped.
 Is this possible - i&#x27;d rather not make this setup more complicated?
 Thanks

                              <span>I was having an interesting conversation about network monitoring today but we couldn&#x27;t agree on how much was enough. This got me thinking is there a known blueprint on what where and how much you should monitor? If you cover the bases of latency and loss is there much more to it for general enterprises?
 Edit: I should add this is a question around maintenance and performance rather than security.

                              <span>I have two Force10 switches in a VLT running code 9.14 . As we utilize the VLT functionality we have port channels that stretch over both switches. I am in the process of demoing a few different network detection solutions. With these solutions, some only have the ability to feed a single span port into. I created a span port on switch 1. As we utilize port channels I need to send data from both switches. How can I send span data from the second switch into the first switches span port? Below is the Force10 guide I found, looking through it (page 690), I am unclear of the way to accomplish what I need and support while helpful couldnt give me a concrete answer.

                              <span>When I first started learning about networks it made most sense to have a firewall at the edge of a network. Now I am learning that it is just as common to use a router as an edge device. 
 How do you protect the edge router? Do layer 3 passive firewalls exist? Forgive me, I&#x27;m new :)

                              <span>Hi r/networking,
 With modern access switching gear (Cisco 9200, Juniper EX3400, etc.) is there any risk of a DDoS attack affecting the switching gear if I have my two internet connections for a branch land on the access switch before going to our router? It can be assumed the internet connection is less than 100mbps.
 I was proposing shift to doing this as opposed to landing the internet links directly on the router but my supervisor is concerned about DDoS risks?
 Most of our internet links are less than 50mbps symmetric, though there are a few slightly bigger circuits, but I can&#x27;t fathom how this could possibly be an issue on a switch with a data rate of 300+gbps / 250mbps throughput. Any input/thoughts/resources would be appreciated!
 Thank you!

                              <span>This might be a rookie question. Please be gentle.
 Currently have a ~20km link that has a 40 km QSFP+ transceiver connected at the far end. When a Optical Light Meter is connected it reports -2.8 dbm, but local connected QSFP+ reports -8.2 dbm. Close to a 6 dbm difference.
 Should you trust the reported light levels received at the SFP/QSFP transceivers? (i.e. show interface diagnostic optics etc...)Or the reported light levels reported by a connected Optical Light Meter?
 edited: fixed a few details on the distance on transceiver.

                              <span>Hello everyone, this seems a really simple question. If i configure a network with OSPF and i have some subinterfaces on a particular interface that needs to be passive, do i just put the interface in passive or do i need to do it on every single subinterface?
 To rephrase it: does &quot;passive-interface g0/0/2&quot; work on all subinterfaces or do i need to do &quot;passive-interface g0/0/2.1&quot; &quot;passive-interface g0/0/2.2&quot; ...

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am seeing some very strange behavior when changing an IS-IS metric.
 The metric change is happening on a interface connecting to another DC router. The connection is to a transit router that provides internet connectivity to the connected DC.
 So, metric change on R1(DC2) connected to transit router (DC1)
 When I change the IS-IS metric on the interface of the router, it is causing what appears to be routing issues for a customer in DC1. The customer route to its destination does not pass through or depend upon routing in DC2 and connects directly to the transit in DC1. Traceroutes before and after change show this.
 So, how can a IS-IS metric change on a router interface have any bearing at all on a couple of routes through a completely separate infrastructure?
 I&#x27;m stumped :)

                              <span>We&#x27;re up for a renewal and are thinking about ditching ProxySG (Bluecoat/Symantec/Broadcom/...) as 1) they are very expensive 2) even sales people are hard to come by and 3) we are using mostly 20% of the features anyway.
 We have evaluated as alternatives:
  
Cisco WSA (previously Ironport): My brain starts bleeding when I look at the GUI, NEXT!
 FortiProxy: Does not seem to be a very popular product but it might do what we want although we probably have to restructure our ACLs and the price tag looks +/- ok
  
Any other alternatives coming to mind for stuff that is readily available in EU?
 Reqs:
  
HA (active-passive is ok)
 exceptions to group-based rules must be easy to implement (e.g. add/remove categories for a user/group)
 Category/URL filter
  Application Control (e.g. make sure that protocol used is HTTP if that is what is expected, and not someone tunnelling SSH)
  SSL inspection
  HTTP basic auth (LDAP bind) yes, LDAP bind
  some people need to authenticate, others are just authd by their IP range
  also supports FTP/SSH filtering
  (optionally) can be used to protect DNS service i.e. filter DNS to the Internet
  
No, squid is not a solution. We need some enterprisey product with a GUI, &quot;official&quot; block lists and all that.

 Is anyone able to point me in the right direction, please?

                              <span>I need to create a network of linux vms for running some workloads like databases, applications, monitoring infrastructure.
 In a previous iteration of such a network, the vms were not connected to the internet and therefore did not require any kind of firewall etc.
 Now, requirements have changed and I need to connect the network to the internet. The datacenter hosting my infrastructure has simple virtual networks and a simple firewall which can be configured on that network.
 Because the amount of servers I have to manage will now grow beyond 20, I can&#x27;t keep using IPs for everything as obviously this will probably lead to misconfigurations etc.
 My main question: Is OPNSense an appropriate choice for my scenario? It seems that I will be able to use not only its firewalling and NAT-capabilities, but also its DHCP and DNS features in order for me to move from IPs to proper hostnames. As a hardcore-beginner in networking, I am not able to assess if this a typical, valid use case or I abuse a system that is not for that.
 Disclaimer: I am a total networking noob. I mainly work as programmer and have worked a lot with Kubernetes (as a user, not cluster admin) and therefore know the theoretical backgorund of all involved protocols and the OSI layers, but I lack the practical experiance...
 Thank you for your time and opinion ;)

                              <span>Hi,
 I got little complicated task to make site-to-site VPN with little twist and now i am just wondering is it even possible.
 So the task is to make site-to-side VPN tunnel from Fortigate with static IP to the Cisco that has Dynamic IP. These devices locates on different countries.
 Location A:
 - Fortigate 100E
 - Static WAN IP
 Location B:
 -Cisco IR809G
 -Dynamic WAN IP
 - LTE network
 ​
 How should i configure this? Cisco using DDNS and Fortigate as normal ? 
 Thanks for responses.

Claimed he had 20+ years of linux experience, couldn&#x27;t answer basic questions then got angry when we pressed him for actual answers
 Literally googled questions in the interview with a mechanical keyboard, we could all hear it over the phone
 Told us confidently that powershell was a linux-native shell and that Microsoft had just adopted it for their uses

                              <span>So I am a one-man IT department that handles the assets of a small scientific supply company (~30 employees), owned jointly by four different people. I&#x27;ve been doing fine on my own, but recently, the company hired a new warehouse and shipping specialist to handle shipping and receiving packages as well as to keep track of inventory for the whole company. 
 In about three months, this person has engineered a situation where now the company is dependent on her to run the business: every time we need the get the materials to build the stuff we make, we need to go through her to get it. She did it under the guise of improving company operations and keeping better track of inventory, however, I strongly suspect she is far more interested in gaining control and power within the company. I am extremely creeped out by her. 
 Now she&#x27;s is targeting my department. She has been demanding that I hand over my inventory of computers, servers, networking equipment, etc. I think she wants to engineer the same scenario with me, where if I want to deploy a new computer/server, I have to go through her first. So far I&#x27;ve resisted these demands, mainly due to security, as I don&#x27;t want the information of our sensitive IT infrastructure to fall in the wrong hands. But the other main reason is that I&#x27;m just flat out creeped out by this person. 
 I&#x27;ve been with the company for longer than she has, and I have enough clout with two of the owners who are siding with me. Two of the owners are siding with her. This is a very interesting dilemma I&#x27;m finding myself in, and I wanted to ask my fellow sysadmins on what are your thoughts? Is it customary for non-IT people to manage IT inventory? Should I fight this?

We have been using Zoom Large Meetings, due to the fact that Zoom Webinars doesn&#x27;t support cameras on for all participants. However, we have passed the 1,000 cap on Large Meetings participants and need a solution that can accommodate more people. I have been given the task of finding a solution by Friday. The constraints are:
  
 Must accommodate up to 3,000 people
  All attendees (yes all of them) MUST have their cameras on (no it wasn&#x27;t my idea)

                              <span>So I am tasked with building out a network that follows various compliance regulations, and many of the requirements need some way to manage aspects of the devices that would require some centralized device management system, such as Active Directory. The current network uses AD and has an on-prem domain controller, but we are completely re-doing everything. The caveat here is that my manager is adamant against using Active Directory or Azure. The alternatives he has suggested would help manage user sign on to devices, but do not help with the more technical aspects (like group policy to disable USB ports, etc.).
 My manager also wants to move a lot of stuff to AWS, so if there is an AWS service that is like a cloud-based Domain Controller (aside from setting up a Windows Server EC2 instance) that can manage on-prem devices that might be &quot;acceptable&quot; for him.
 ​
 Any input would be much appreciated!

                              <span>So I found this interesting, we were hiring for a jr sys admin and were open for someone just out of school, and I was just shocked by the applicants that had some sort of &quot;cyber cert&quot; form XYZ college, or even an associates degree in cyber security. I feel like these days students must be pressured hard into cyber programs at universities. As important as security is to me and our companies IT operations department, in a new person I would prefer a traditional IT degree and certs such as Azure, CCENT, Net+, Linux+, Sec+. yeah you know how to use Snort and Kali linux to do web app penetration, and can hack some aspects of AD, but do you really understand the fundamentals of AD, o365, networking, linux, Vmware&amp;Cloud, or do you just plug in scripts your instructor gives you. I think colleges may be taking advantage of students, making them think they will land some high flying pen testing position, then they find themselves falling back and applying to sysadmin and wonder why they cannot land a job.

                              <span>Throughout the last week I&#x27;ve been testing ChatGPT to see why people have been raving about it and this post is meant to describe my experience
 So over the last week i&#x27;ve used ChatGPT successfully to:
  
Help me configure LACP, BGP and vlans via the Cisco iOS CLI
 
Help me write powershell, rust, and python code
 Help me write ansible playbooks
 Help me write a promotional letter to my employer
 Help me sleep train my toddler 
 Help improve my marriage
 Help come up with meal ideas for the week that takes less than 30 minutes to create
 Helped me troubleshoot a mechanical issue on my car
  
Given how successfully it was with the above I decided to see what arguably the world most advanced AI to have ever been created wasn&#x27;t able to do........ so I asked it a Microsoft Licensing question (SPLA related) and it was the first time it failed to give me an answer.
 So ladies and gentlemen, there you have it, even an AI model with billions of data points can&#x27;t figure out what Microsoft is doing with its licensing.
 Ironically Microsoft is planning on investing 10 Billion into this project so fingers crossed, maybe the future versions might be able to accomplish this

                              <span>While interviewing 3 months ago for Cloud Engineering type positions it was a clear expectation of mine that wfh was a requirement. Want me in the office a few days a week for an intro period (if they’re close enough) sure thing, no problem.
 So I’ve been going in 1-3 days a week for the past 3 months. As I’m approaching my 90 days, I brought up that I’ll be switching over to full wfh. My manager was like “well….the board walked through the office the other day and really didn’t like all of the empty chairs, so they’re pulling back a bit on the wfh conversions for newer employees”. He noted we’ll just have to submit a conversion form and hope it gets approved.
 Now, I’ve never been one to like hold something over someone’s head, but this position had 140 applicants, took them 6 months to fill, and it was me.
 We have an additional new hire starting with my same title frommmm Texas….sooooo I’m being discriminated against because I just happen to live close?
 I want to approach my request as respectfully as possible, but at the same time, I’ll leave. 140K a year or not, I’ll find somewhere else. 
 Thoughts?

 Can someone tell me what&#x27;s the best practice for creating an admin account only for the purpose of using it on client computers? 
 We have a solution which randomises the local admin account, but I also need a backup solution. I&#x27;d like to create an AD account for this, but how do I make it a client computer only admin account ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi,
 so I was asked to create a contact list for our company (~40 users) that is available for everyone. The list consists of customer and supplier contact data (phone numbers and email adresses).
 The list should be automatically synced to everyone without further configuration on the user side. The contacts should be available in the outlook app on Android and also synced to the native &quot;phone&quot; app.
 The list should be editable by everyone or a few individuals with non-admin permissions.
 We are 100% Azure AD and every device is managed by Intune. Everyone has a MS365 Business Premium license. I am a 1-man IT and relatively new to MS365.
 Solutions I considered:
  
As far as I understood, a public folder with a contact list in exchange is the &quot;old school&quot; way to do it. The list does show …</span>

                              <span>Ideally, I&#x27;d like to run esxi and multiple VMs on top of it. My current hardware is HPE ProLiant Gen 9/10 servers. Each of these servers have 8 bays for hard disks. I&#x27;ve got a mixture of SATA SSDs, SAS HDDs of various sizes in them. 
 And recently the disks started failing, mostly the SAS HDD disks. And I assumed that they must be bad so was planning to replace them with SATA SSDs but I realise after a quick google search, I may have been on the wrong path. And I asked a question about the disk failures here and the answers only provoke more questions in my mind. 
 As a novice who just started out on system administration, I&#x27;m now wondering what&#x27;s the best disks out there for what I&#x27;m trying to do and what&#x27;s the best RAID configuration for what I&#x27;m trying to achieve?
 I understand that there are countless ways of doing what I want to do. I also understand that if I opt for external storage (with vSANs?) I might be better off as the resources are pooled together, I&#x27;d like to understand how I can do it better with what I have (by may be replacing just the disks) and also a future plan when the budget allows to strengthen my infrastructure. 
 A colleague recently told me that disks fail for whatever reason and if they&#x27;re in warranty you just claim from supplier or you buy a new one. Although arbitrary, it doesn&#x27;t sit well with me. There must be reasons and best practices that the industry follow. I&#x27;m only trying to find that out. Can someone please help me out? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>We have roughly 20 shared desktop machines in a lab that our engineers log into to run tests on hardware from a remote location.
 They are screaming for more machines but we (IT) feel they are under utilized and what we&#x27;re truly seeing are engineers logging into machines and not logging back out when their test is complete.
 Can anyone suggest a simple piece of software that could log their ID&#x27;s when they log in and record the amount of time the machine was in use by them log it and allow me to review that data say after a week to find the culprits?
 Everything I find either requires a monthly subscription or is far more complex than we need.

                              <span>Any admins here still use UPS Worldship? With the upcoming Edge changes coming in about a month, I&#x27;m trying to make sure this still works fine. The app has many hardcoded hyperlinks that force IE11 to open instead of URL handlers to use the native web browser, since I assume this app was written sometime between the Bronze and Iron ages of humanity. We&#x27;ve already had to whitelist IE on this particular computer, but the upcoming changes suggest it&#x27;s gonna get yote by Microsoft soon.
 The buttons are so they can quickly order supplies et al, and also logs them into their UPS account for them. They do not have the login details anymore, and UPS support has been... less than stellar. (Downright awful.)

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins. I work for an MSP subcontracted to a customer and I&#x27;m struggling to find a solution to managing access for the guest wireless.
 The customer have a Wi-Fi network set up for guest use using Meraki NAT so it doesn&#x27;t touch the LAN.
 Previously they had a preshared key that was given out to guests who came to their office. This worked for a while until people started complaining it was mega slow. I log on to Meraki cloud manager and find there was more than 100 devices connected to this SSID. This network is also speed and bandwidth limited to preserve resources for LAN traffic on the APs. It looks like people had been using the PSK to add their own personal devices to the guest wireless thereby slowing it down.
 Before Christmas, the password was changed and it was decided it it was only visible to IT staff who enter it into guest devices when they arrive, but this is far from ideal for a number of reasons.
 I have also suggested changing the password every month and only giving the password to the receptionist who then gives it to the guest. But there are concerns from management the receptionist will just give it out to anyone and we are back where we were before.
 I did look at the Meraki sponsorship option for the guest wireless but this has no reporting feature and no way to authorise specific people who can be sponsors. Again, this is a problem because people will just start authorising their own devices, with no way of seeing who is doing this.
 All the APs are various Cisco Meraki models.
 How are you guys managing guest wireless in your workplaces?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;d like to ask for someone&#x27;s assistance or advice on how to solve this given issue. 
 Issue: The issue appeared two days ago, every attempt to log on steam application failed with the given error &quot;failed to update&quot; due to connectivity parameters. at first I attempted to check the diagnose, but there were no indication of connection time out whatsoever. Some other applications that share significance or that rely on the internet connection also can&#x27;t update or work online while some can. There were couple of weird things that left me puzzled, I tried to get on google chrome, while it let me access the internet, could download stuff on it, However, when I tried to get on Mozila or other indie browsers i ended up with &quot;No Internet&quot; error. When I used Jdownloader for example on google drive I couldn&#x27;t access it but when I used bittorrent I could download stuff from it. So through trial-and-error approach my leads were to try and stop dns client via group policy which was impossible because I couldn&#x27;t even click on the stop or pause button. I also attempted to flash ipconfig via cmd, renew it as well but it didn&#x27;t work. What else I tried was to controlset1 and change its value to 0 in the regedit, I also attempted to manually enter the proxy 8.8.8.8 ip in the internet settings, none of it worked. So I&#x27;m truly hoping that I won&#x27;t need to reboot my pc fully once again. (I have to note that my firewall, avast were shut down during the process.)

 I am in the process of migrating AD connect from V1 to V2. I have the new one on our 2016 domain controller in staging mode and have run the comparison report. It has flagged four accounts for the attribute msDS-KeyCredentialLink. I have googled this but not much info. We don&#x27;t use windows Hello or Intune. Do I need to do anything here?
 Thanks

                              <span>Does anyone have a master site or sites they use to harden RDS? 
 Also is there away to block users from copying and pasting into or from RDS?

                              <span>Hello,
 We&#x27;re looking for some 3rd-party WMS that could be integrated with NetSuite ERP. Unfortunately, the NetSuite WMS doesn&#x27;t work with our workflow so we&#x27;re looking for other solutions.
 I&#x27;ve heard of RF-Smart but would like to know my other options.
 Thanks.

 I found fraud in my org and reported it up the pecking order. 
 Nothing changed for a few weeks, but then Friday I get a call. they’re dismantling my team of 5, and I am now the sole owner of the system with fraudulent data. 
 As of Friday, I initiated a data freeze in that system until those that made the fraudulent requests fixes the inputs on their end. 
 Prior to this, I was just the oversight on this specific system, to report to my manager whenever something differed from our standard. 
 Am I being scapegoated? Are they promoting me? Should I run, or ask for more money? 
 I spent the weekend applying for dream jobs. Depending on how today goes, I may just lower my standards and take the first offer that comes my way…

                              <span>So I have a setup of servers with internal storage running esxi as the hypervisor with VMs on top of them. And I have some disks failing with different RAID configurations so I have the following questions if someone can help with them please. 
  
I have a RAID0 disk that I boot esxi from and I&#x27;m scared to lose that disk (like I lost another boot disk). I realise now that I should have at least specified RAID1 so I&#x27;m planning to do that but I need advice on the best way to go about this. The current boot disk is a HDD and I&#x27;d like to move to SSDs. How would I just failover to the new RAID1 configuration without issues? Thankfully I have empty bays where I can plug the new disks in for this server so hopefully this is not too difficult? 
 I also have a RAID5 configuration on a different server where I&#x27;ve exhausted all the storage bays and one of the disks failed. Now, the problem is that all these disks are HDDs. I know that I cannot setup an array of HDD &amp; SSD in one so how do I go about replacing these? To be specific, I have 8 1TB HDD disks on this server and since then I&#x27;ve been able to purchase 1TB/4TB SSDs disks so I&#x27;m trying to find the best way to upgrade/fix the issues as I&#x27;ve found HDDs to be less reliant. 
  
Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve just been charged with managing my companies SharePoint directory. A bit of context, we are a small Construction company running in different states. We have all of our construction job files via SharePoint. These are creating using Team Sites that have a Job number associated with them.
 This is a two part question:
  
Is it possible to create a SharePoint site that lists the active sites in a list/directory of sorts?
 If so, is it possible to seperate that list to specific states and have each sharepoint site for that state listed under it?

 I get crazy high CPU die/tcl temps even on idle (114oC). I just repaste both cpus, looked fine even before redoing..
 On full dual CPU load, die/tcl goes up to 140-150oC (not F!!!) and core go around 88-94oC.
 Room is proper 20C/LowOxygen Env. New data centre. 
 My Gigabyte servers with the same config look ok :S
 Any known BIOS bugs?!

 We&#x27;re currently making a knowledge management software and one of its main features is metadata and relationship for easier searching, relating, and retrieval of information.
 I&#x27;m doing customer validation research and was hoping if I could get some survey participants since the people here I assume use documentation a lot in their work which is one of our products&#x27; use cases. 
 If you have a different use case in mind, I would love to hear them as well.
 I&#x27;ll only send the survey link if I am asked by interested people in the DM&#x27;s. Thanks!
 Hope everyone is having a great day! :)

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m playing around with LXC on an embedded board so it can be deployed at scale, I&#x27;m wondering if there is some sort of agent that can be installed on the host then it will phone to another server and ask for which container it should deploy/update/start/stop...
 Has anyone already invented something like this? The closest thing that I&#x27;ve use is ResinOS but I don&#x27;t know anyone has made a standalone agent.

 For the internet they do not use DHCP but put manual IPv4. We do that so that people don&#x27;t come with their own PC and start using the bandwidth. I&#x27;ve heard that for DHCP you can only filter using MAC adress but might as well stays in manual.
 My question is can DHCP ONLY gives an adress to devices in our domain?

                              <span>How can you get access to a customer RDS database on a separate account and get their data onto your own aurora database using AWS Glue.
 So currently I&#x27;m trying to use Aws Glue which will assume an Iam role which allows RDS connection to their database to ETL to our aurora database.
 Only issue is Im not sure which network connection to use which will be the easiest to setup as well as being affordable, scalable and secure.
 I understand some of the options are vpc peering, direct connect, private link and transit gateway. Was wondering which ones you all would recommend and how to set them up.

 I&#x27;m just looking at a few solutions that are fairly cheap, and easy to use for 365 management specifically for SIEM with SOC. Has anyone used Vijilan, eSentire or Arcticwolf? and what do you make of these types of solutions?

 Found something about the wevtutil command and I was wondering can it be used to solve my problem.
 Also, the windows server mentioned is a Windows 2019 server.

                              <span>Trying to build a report using PowerShell and Graph with the below code:
 $sku &#x3D; Get-MgSubscribedSku -All | ? SkuPartNumber -eq &#x27;XXXX&#x27; $props &#x3D; &#x27;UserPrincipalName&#x27;,&#x27;LicenseAssignmentStates&#x27; $users &#x3D; Get-MgUser -All -Filter &quot;&quot;assignedLicenses/any(x:x/skuId eq $($sku.SkuId) )&quot; -ConsistencyLevel eventual -CountVariable E3Count -Property $props | select props 
 The licenseAssignmentStates property of the user contains additional properties and I need to grab the AssignedByGroup and SkuId properties which can be achieved using the following:
 $users.LicenseAssignmentStates | select AssignedByGroup, SkuId 
 I also need the UserPrincipalName to come up with a report which shows UserPrincipalName, AssignedByGroup, SkuId. The UserPrincipalName property is not part of the licenseAssignmentStates property where I am grabbing the two other properties (AssignedByGroup, SkuId). Can I use PSCustomObjects or any expressions to get all 3 properties in a single script?

 TL;DR: I ran a scan against the three million most visited domains and discovered that the Ukrainian MoD, MIT,  University, University of Miami, along with 1000+ other domains had mistakenly used the “+all” SPF mechanism at the end of their respective SPF records – effectively meaning any public IP address can send SPF authenticated emails on their behalf. These results were validated through emails I sent to myself from a select number of the affected domains.

                              <span>In a Unix-based environment, when transferring data via rsync to a remote host (via ssh), the identity of a known remote host is verified by checking if the public-key fingerprint matches what is found in known_hosts. A somewhat analogous practice in a Windows-based environment is transferring data to a remote computer or server via robocopy (e.g., robocopy .\local\path \\secondhost\another\path ...). In the latter scenario (for sake of simplicity, let&#x27;s say on the same network), is there an equivalent protocol/procedure that is used/can be used to verify the identity of the remote host/share? Or are the DNS responses normally assumed to be trustworthy?

                              <span>We are a small company with less than 50 employees excluding contractors that don&#x27;t require IT services. IT has been neglected for years here and MSP didn&#x27;t do much either nor was asked to.
 Getting rid of MSP so have to manage IT now. That would involve getting network and performance monitoring, security monitoring, helpdesk etc.
 Mostly migrated to AWS, everything Linux based, dockerized mostly or SaaS. Migrated from MS SQL server to PostgreSQL.
 We have reduced our on-prem VM footprint to 6 VMs (VMware ESXi 7) on two Dell R730 and one R620 servers. Among the six VMs are two domain controllers. One is 2008 R2 and another one is 2016. All FSMO roles are on 2008 server. Each DC also has DNS, DHCP roles as well. We have Office 365 Business Basic, on-prem sharepoint server, quickbooks running on a 2016 Windows Server.
 End goal is to have SSO with AWS and other SaaS services like Jira Project tracking, Bitbucket, Mimecast, Office 365. I want to use AD FS for this. Is this the best way to go for SSO ?
 Definitely replacing the 2008 DC to 2022 (fresh install) but should I upgrade 2016 server to 2022 as well? Are there any better approaches to architecture here? I am open to better solutions.

                              <span>I’m curious about where everyone hosts their monitoring servers? Avid PRTG user within our organization’s on-prem small data centers. We are looking at cleaning up our setup and are stuck with the question of whether or not PRTG should live in the same DC that it primarily monitors, or have it cloud hosted?
 Cloud ain’t cheap..so maybe just having a redundant outgoing network connection works? But that’s not always a clean way to do things either. Server goes down &#x3D; no after-hours alerts of issues. 
 What do you do?

                              <span>I work for a large hospital environment, and we have a significant amount of legacy internal and vendor hosted sites our users use. We have spent a lot of time identifying sites that don&#x27;t work in Edge native mode and are required to be added to the enterprise site mode list. We have identified many sites and most work fine in IE11 mode. So, this is working well for us.
 However, we have no visibility of how many users are still launching IE11 directly potentially due to a site not working in edge. We would like to be able to audit where anyone is launching IE11 and find out why then remediate if required. We tried using MECM Software Metering but found that when a site loaded in edge uses IE11 mode then iexplore.exe is launched making this worthless.
 I&#x27;ve reached out to Microsoft, but they just suggested we use the Disable IE Policy and wait for users to complain. Not ideal in a hospital environment.
 Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Not the end of the world but it is my favorite note taking tool and their recommendation of using Visual Studio Code is not an appropriate replacement. I code. I know how to use VS Code. It is not a good note taking tool like the immaculate notepad++. 
 &quot;F*** off&quot; to whichever execs thought it was a good idea to take my nice little tool away. That&#x27;s it. All I really had to say.
 Edit: no hate ate the Sys Admin who pushed the buttons to take it away. I know where it came from.

                              <span>So, long story short. 
 We’re a new carrier that was reassigned a 16-bit ASN by ARIN. 
 Fine and dandy, until we see that there is an IRR record for a /24 being announced by Level 3 still. Level 3 is Lumen (CTL).
 I called their Tier 3 support and their Pro NOC. Not a single person knew what BGP or an ASN meant. 
 Trying to explain BGP and an ASN to the highest possible support at Lumen is ridiculous.

                              <span>A while back, NIST standardized new algorithms to replace RSA and EC / DH (the public key algorithms that will break easily once quantum computers are stable). Has anyone been able to get an answer from MS about when AD Certificate Services will implement anything quantum-resistant?
 At preset, YubiKeys with the native smart card functionality of Windows is the most effective way to require multi-factor for logging in as a domain administrator (common insurance thing), without off-prem dependencies and basically no cost beyond the keys themselves. Smart cards depend on PKI so they need to be updated to post-quantum eventually.
 Once RSA and EC become unsafe and/or forbidden, this could be a widespread issue, especially if Microsoft decides to disregard NIST standards in AD CS to leverage this to force everyone into a full AAD migration. Has anyone been able to find any hints about their intentions yet?

                              <span>Started a new job and making stupid mistakes. I&#x27;ve never cried over work but sure did Friday. Think I jumped into something over my head. I still enjoy the work. Learning a lot. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s imposter syndrome. Just think it&#x27;s imposter. Should have taken a month off between jobs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going insane trying to stop this torrent of spam being sent to one particular user, it seems if I cut one head off 4 more appear. It appears he accidentally clicked something in a driveby email spam and now they are just relentless...
 But my issue is they&#x27;re sending from amazonses and other legitimate providers, seemingly from domains that appear legitimate but aren&#x27;t, so as not to end up on any blacklists. I&#x27;ve had about 20 different domains offering various &quot;investment advice&quot; and each has a barebones website, so far I&#x27;ve had The Daily Recap, SMHNews, Manhatten Winner, Jeff Clark, Market Minute, etc etc etc... if I even touch the unsubscribe button we get 4 more of these emailing the user.
 So far I&#x27;ve been trying to find commonalities between the emails but they all use large providers and change their wording just slightly (ie &quot;This ad is sent by...&quot; to &quot;This opportunity is sent by...&quot;)
 I&#x27;ve got some pretty aggressive regex which catches 90-100% of it most of the time but then come the wave of new &quot;providers&quot;. I hard bounce in the hope Amazon/Sendgrid/etc will shut these accounts down but to no avail, I think they have created 99% of their own accounts so a 1% bounce rate doesn&#x27;t affect them?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been tasked to see if there is a way to set up a custom news popup when logging into a PC that our CEO can update with the latest news about corporate events. Has anyone had to tackle something like this before? Or is there any kind of software that would do this? I showed him how we can set a PowerShell script up to show a toast notification but he wants something nice and big to popup right in the middle of the screen. Kind of like a steam notification about the latest deals.

                              <span>Hi Folks
 ​
 What&#x27;s the best disk cloning tool that doesn&#x27;t cost the earth? what do you use and recommend?
 Looking to replace about 10 mechanical hard drives with SSD&#x27;s. I suspect bitlocker is enabled on most of them.
 Ill probably have 3-4 a month after that too for a good time.
 In descending order i want to
 Deal with Bitlocker especially where the user has no idea that it&#x27;s turned on or what it is 
 Direct clone a users drive including permissions etc
 use it to deploy a windows 10 image
 Create backup snapshots (nice to have)
 Verify drive health (nice to have)
 ​
 any suggestions? Free is good but I&#x27;ll take a paid bit of software if it&#x27;s extremely easy to use
 ​
 thanks in advance

I have a device for my Air Conditioner where I replicated the IR and can turn on and off the AC remotely whenever I want. Hoping there is something like this for a TV remote?

I am pretty sure it was set up to handle the AD groups we had setup to access the VPN on our SonicWALL before 2FA was set up (we now have local users in the FW with 2FA enabled). Is there a way to tell what it is actually doing? Can I shut it down, or stop the service for a scream test without everything imploding?

 This particular scope (10.19.96.0/20) has wireless clients only. No physical ports in organisation has been configured to use this scope i.e. no ports untagged on this network vlan).
 We also 10+ several other networks which are not affected,
 10.99.0.0 - Staff BYOD Wireless devices
 10.51.0.0 - Domain Wireless computers
 10.195.0.0 - AP management network
 10.1.10.0 - Servers network
 10.20.32.0 - Security network
 I have followed this guide petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0001651 to capture the traffic logs using Wireshark on DHCP server, however it is only picking up the network id on the source column for the bootp packets. 10.1.10.10 is DHCP server and this is the only DHCP server we have. 10.x.x.1 are the default gateway for each network vlan.
 Screenshot for Wireshark https://i.imgur.com/Loyu9a7.png
 DHCP lease https://i.imgur.com/ujBQUOa.png None of the IP can be PINGed.
 All vlans has IP Helper address pointing to 10.1.10.10 (DHCP Server). 
 Any help on this would be much appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 I created an ISO file to install windows on different PC with different pre-install APPS. the thing comes here:
 I created a second ISO file the same way but it has grown in storage. the first ISO has 11GB and the second 16 GB. How can i do it so that i&#x27;d be a normal ISO. 
 The steps were:
 1) i Installed windows 10 from iso to a VM,
 2) i Install some apps, and sysprep the VM
 3) Open with Windows PE, and create an Image of the disk. Windows.wim file was created.
 4) I turn the wim file into a ISO file. And that was it. 
 I read the sysprep doesnt eliminate users but I wanted to ask if it&#x27;s possible that the increase in size is about the users.
 Can you help me?
 Thanks a lot.

Was wondering whether there was a service available which can do something like allow you to slot the SIM cards into a device, like a SIM bank, convert to voip and then transmit messages and/or phone calls either self-hosted or from their servers via an app on a mobile device such as a smart watch

I noticed that all my Ubuntu and Debian VMs which were set to use DHCP arent registering their MAC Addresses, but instead some longer identifier. I&#x27;ve read that it has to do with how Ubuntu/Debian request DHCP and that it is presenting an Identifier that is representative of the system rather then the ethernet NIC, which sounds great in theory , because what if the NIC is changed ? Well I cannot figure out how to change it back to using the MAC address, nor can I figure out how to make DHCP reservations work properly with this identifier. There are some references to editing files on the Ubuntu/Debian VMs that basically tell DHCP service to use the hardware add…</span>

                              <span>Our typical offboarding process for a user account includes converting their EO User Mailbox to Shared Mailbox and removing their EOP/365 license.
 I can&#x27;t find anything definitive about what happens to the Online Archive (if the user had one) once this process has occurred - presumably no license ultimately means no Online Archive at some point down the line? 
 Anyone have any experience / knowledge about how this works in practice?

 Could this be a sign that my laptop has been compromised?

 History: A user account was once renamed (before my time) 
 Hybrid infrastructure:
 Now email doesn&#x27;t arrive in outlook application at the correct time, sometimes it takes hours sometimes DAYS even weeks. This includes bot external and internal mails. Sometimes it works as intended. There are no &quot;correct&quot; patterns to show some errors.
 users computer is running windows 10.
 The emails end up correct in webmail, phone etc everytime 
 We have tried EVERYTHING.
 The classics of new mailbox, online/cache mode. new computers (3 of them),
 Same behaviour. 
 I&#x27;ve tried to check everything on the users Attirbutse, to see if there are any mismatch spelling, any wierd proxy adresses - nothing. Its all clean 
 Have anyone of you ever experienced something like this before? Any ideas of what we could have a closer look at? 
 Best regard

                              <span>After my previous posts and good advice I got, we have decided to scrap hybrid join and just AzureAD join the devices and remove from the domain.
 1) When I do a manual AzureAD join it using the users account, it creates the new profile as a local admin. Is this the right way of doing it but then just logging in as Global Admin and setting them back to standard user?
 I don&#x27;t have a spare license just for a enrol type account, so think doing it as user is the only way.
 2) Since its a new profile for AzureAD does Forensit tool work for migrating? (like it does with domain accounts)
 3) What&#x27;s the order in which this should be done? If I remove from the on prem domain first before AzureAD joining then we lose access unless I set local account

                              <span>Hi!
 Is there any trusted online vulnerability testing website where you can insert your server public IP to check it for vulnerabilities?
 Thanks

                              <span>This is a rather simple and also complicated matter I&#x27;m running out of ideas for, so here&#x27;s the scoop;
 I have a few users with disabilities which impairs their ability to type on a keyboard and use a mouse, they can do it but very slowly but that isn&#x27;t the issue. The issue is the Windows change password screen which obfuscates the password text, so whenever they&#x27;re trying to enter a new password they lose track of what they&#x27;ve typed in because they can&#x27;t see the characters, get frustrated, and give up.
 So what I&#x27;m looking for are any &quot;Alternate&quot; methods for user password updates?
 I should add this is on an Active Directory Domain, and despite being a very big corporation actively block Azure Active Directory domain join so that rules those features out. We do use Okta for SSO and Identity, which in theory could work with password writeback but it&#x27;s still a bit cludgy as the local computer must sync with the domain while connected via VPN, meaning an account re-login.
 (Under normal circumstances this would be a non-issue, but I wouldn&#x27;t be making this post if it was)
 The very minimum I&#x27;ve got working as a happy medium is to enable Windows Hello PIN logon for their local machine, but that doesn&#x27;t help when it comes to their corporate AD account and any screen/menu where a password cannot be easily entered.

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a Server 2012 R2 with BitLocker MBAM installed on it.
 This is running smoothly for years without any issues.
 Now we have to upgrade server 2012 R2 to a later version.
 Is an in-place upgrade supported here?
 I there anything we need to pay attention to before/after the upgrade? Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got failover cluster running a set of Hyper-V VMs and the HDDs in the pool are running on 5-6 years old. I have a new batch of drives installed, and mapped in the same NAS enclosure ready to go.
 I&#x27;m looking for advice on the best way to migrate all of the VMs to their new home in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve me manually rebuilding every VM configuration. If it was just 1-2 VMs I&#x27;d just copy the VHD over to the new drives and use the VHD as the storage for a new VM but I&#x27;ve got quite a few of these to move and I&#x27;d like to know for the future as well.
 Downtime is expected and perfectly fine, I&#x27;ve just never done this kind of migration before and want to make sure I don&#x27;t do anything unnecessary or leave myself open to forgetting a config (My predecessor did this forgot to assign more than 1 core to more than a dozen VMs and no one noticed for months lol)
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I am thinking of migrating a company from ADFS to use Azure AD as the primary IdP. What are like the cons of this because everywhere I&#x27;ve read, using Azure AD Connect is basically the new way to seamless SSO and auth and ADFS is outdated. Users already have E3 licenses and I feel like syncing between On-Prem and Azure is way better with AAD than ADFS. I&#x27;d love to get some input before I proceed. Perhaps there is compliance reasons or migration issues or something, but I feel like from my research AAD Connect is the way to go.

That only means that there are no more free IPv4 addresses that can be assigned to an organization. But not every IP address is in use. ISPs, hosting providers and other organizations have IPv4 reserves that are not actively in use. 
 Is there an estimate on how many IPv4 addresses are actually in use / are free?

 So there&#x27;s the work PC , and we need the home PC offer the same desktop , data and apps(chrome with same tabs ,office).
 But when not at work the work PC must be turned off(we turn down the electricity at the evening in the biz ,for safety). So the key issue is syncing. so remote desktop won&#x27;t work.
 Would using Google drive for all the data(including desktop and download folders ) and chrome sync, and local versions of office(not possible to use office 365) would work well ?

                              <span>I manage an RDP environment with 200 rdp users connecting through a VPN over all kinds of internet connections.
 The Remote Desktop client (blue one) logs events to Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operational but Windows Remote Desktop client (new shiny buggy red one) does not seem to log anything.
 Anyone knows where to find connection logs for the new Windows Remote Desktop client app? 
 Note: I did look for it but given the app name I get lots of hits for the old client.

 I need to offboard registered devices owned by offboarded users in Azure AD during this process. I&#x27;m referring to non-MDM devices here, so personal devices. Managed devices will come into the process too, but they aren&#x27;t my primary concern right now.
 I assumed this would be an easy task, though I then realized that the Graph API only provides the capability to delete non-managed devices via the delegated &#x27;Directory.AccessAsUser.All&#x27; scope, via https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/devices/ endpoint.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Ive inherited a new network that’s just been setup, with a new windows DHCP server. I did not setup the firewall but did setup the DHCP server.
 We have all our subnet/VLAN scopes imported to windows DHCP. For example, wired (20), wireless (30), security (50), etc. 
 However, that leaves our APs. Whomever initially setup the firewall configured all the APs to the DHCP server on the Palo. 
 What is the best practice in this scenario? Create a new sub interface/VLAN for the APs and migrate scope to windows DHCP? Put them on the wired Vlan? Or get all DHCP off the firewall and create a new scope just for APs?
 Perhaps the engineer setting up the FW was using the Palo dhcp until the new dhcp server was active?
 We would preferably don’t want the FW running dhcp. Is there a technical reason why the APs were put on the firewall DHCP?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out why a FD150 credit card processing machine can&#x27;t connect and obtain an IP address via Wi-Fi on my network. It works using a cabled connection. The network diagram is here. When I try to connect to Wi-Fi it never obtains an IP address. I can, however, turn on the hotspot on my Pixel 6 Pro and it will connect. The hotspot is set for WPA2-Personal
 ​
  
The FD150 supports WPA-AES, WPA-TKIP, and WPA2-AES. I’m not trying to use anything other than WP2-AES
 The WAPs support WPA2-Personal, WPA3-Personal, and WPA-Enterprise. I don’t have/want a RADIUS server, so enterprise is out. I’ve set the WAPs to use WPA2-Personal.
 My believe is that WPA2-Personal and WPA2-AES are the same thing. WPA2-Personal uses AES.
 I’m trying to connect the credit card machine to VLAN30. Other PCs using that VLAN via a different SSID, but same WAP have no problem obtaining an IP address and accessing the internet. I have tried the FD150 connecting to the same SSID as the other PCs – still doesn’t work.
  
I’m working on a method to Wireshark the Wi-Fi packets but finding an adapter that supports monitor mode is not as easy as I thought it would be.
 Am I wrong about the equivalence of WPA2-AES and WPA2-Personal
 Does anybody see anything I’m doing wrong that I’ve missed? I’m sure I’ve forgotten some detail
 Anybody have a recommendation for a Windows or Linux Wi-Fi adapter that supports monitor mode?

                              <span>I work for a company that uses copper from remote radio sites to a central office They haven’t really trained me on this stuff, as I have a bunch of other jobs, and this is just a small portion. 
 I was wondering if I could get some info on how you guys would troubleshoot a circuit if we lost comms to the office. 
 I have a buttset and a TIMS unit. The circuit goes through cross connect blocks, jackfields and a QVF padding rack. 
 I am wondering what the best way to troubleshoot this would be
 Could you just put a tone on the copper coming from the office and just use the buttset to look for the tone through all the CCBs?

                              <span>I have two core switches in an MLAG setup that are doing routing for the network. They connect upstream to a PA220 (I know...I know 🤮). We have four available ports, but right now the cores connect to a dumb switch, then to the PA, so they both have an active connection.
 I&#x27;d like to connect them directly to the PA. Currently port 3 is set as an L3 port and holds the gateway IP address. Do I need to set both ports as L2? Or both as L3?
 I came from ASA world so Palo is a learning curve for me.

                              <span>Hey everyone. I&#x27;ve been trying to get RADIUS configured for authenticating IT personnel on our HP switches. I&#x27;ve followed the config guidelines provided by HP and PacketFence, made allowances in our firewall for 1812 and 1813 which allows the communication. PacketFence is tied into our AD for authenticating against.
 The issue I&#x27;m seeing is that when a user tries to authenticate, it accepts regardless of the password, but only for my team&#x27;s groups user names. 
 My experience and education has been primarily network hardware related and some monitoring software, and my server background is limited so I&#x27;m kind of floundering here for a solution.

 I was wondering do you all use any NDR solutions? If so what did you guys go with and why.
 I am looking at Darktrace and Cisco Stealthwatch (secure analytics). I do have Cisco ISE and Anyconnect so it may be better to use ISE in my case.

                              <span>Helly Guys, the first time I have experience with Huawei NetEngine which is seemed to be abnormal.
 The 25G slot and 25G module is no issue during testing service, but once we shut down the service, we saw that there is something wrong with one port which is Status inside switch is UP/UP and also the physical slot show the green light. The strange thing is with ETH-TRUNK showed both port is down.
 ​
 Have anyone experience the kind of issue? or this is a bug with version of Huawei?
 Thanks guys.

                              <span>Firstly, Background Info.
 So I&#x27;m working at a college as, debatably, the only IT guy and I&#x27;ve got 150 students who just started here. A whole bunch of them have Nintendo Switches and I also have one at hand, however they will not connect to the internet through our &quot;WPA Personal&quot; Ubiquiti SSID. (Nintendo Switches are simply incompatible with &quot;WPA Enterprise&quot; which we use for our main Wi-Fi network) They connect to the network with the password but throw back the message &quot;Registration is required to use this network&quot; when trying to connect to the internet. I HAVE done research but I can&#x27;t find any actual solutions. Other Universities appear to collect MAC Addresses from the students and just add them manually which is no problem but I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea where to do this after gathering the device&#x27;s MAC Addresses.
 I think either our WatchGuard firewall or RADIUS is causing the problem but maybe I&#x27;ve missed a setting in the SSID setup I really don&#x27;t know. I have full access to every server, everything. I just haven&#x27;t a clue what to do with the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s MAC Address to get it to connect to the internet :(
 Currently, I have a test &quot;Nintendo&quot; SSID on the nearest access point to me which I plan to use to troubleshoot the issue further. If I can get it to work here though I&#x27;ll push it out to the other 80 access points.
 Willing to follow any guidance and answer any questions. I hope someone has come across this before. Mobile phones and computers have no issues connecting.
 P.S Let me know if there are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of thing...

                              <span>So if the whole purpose of CG-NAT is to combat the lack of IPv4&#x27;s why does it seemingly having its own firewall settings for port forwarding?
 Every customer on the ISP already has their own router and internal firewall for ports and of course like so many people that hate CG-NAT their own port forwarding rules, so why can&#x27;t the Dynamic public address just have all ports open so that what ever traffic is coming through would work as if their was no extra layer...
 Am I missing a big chunk of how CG-NAT works here, are Ports a big part of how NAT works?
 so a follow up question... If CG-NAT Needs ports to translate from Public - WAN - Private Addresses why couldn&#x27;t we send a packet with the private address alongside the Public one that the router can read thus allowing for private port forwarding rules to work through the Carrier Router
 Note: I&#x27;m a complete networking novice talking out my ass hoping I understand at least 30% of what I&#x27;m talking about... So please be gentle...

 I&#x27;m just curious how you manage your application updates for end devices that are managed via MDM.

                              <span>Hi
 I was wondering if someone else has had this issue before,
 So currently trying to give a user to only have access to a specific folder,
 im testing this out, the folder is /test/html
 the user should only see html folder 
 so these were the steps i took
 ​
 sudo adduser --no-create-home sftpuser usermod -g www-data sftpuser chmod -R 755 html/ chown -R www-data:www-data html/ 
 ​
 then went to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 add this 
 Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
 #SFTP Chroot Jail Match User sftpuser ChrootDirectory /test/html ForceCommand internal-sftp AllowTcpForwarding no X11Forwarding no 
 but i cant seem to login i keep getting this issue
 ​
 fatal: bad ownership or modes for chroot directory component &quot;/test/&quot; 
 Thank you

 Ive heard restores have issues.
 Any reason why to not go with Spanning?
 Also, do they only store M365 data in AWS, or Azure as well?
 Thanks

 It seems to be able to do most tasks correctly, so I&#x27;d be curious if its already officially adopted.

 The chatGPT and AI thing pissed me off because I missed it. Knew about AI in general but didn’t know stuff like this was being used and I’m behind the knowledge curve
 Now sure if the regular tech blogs covered it
 Where does everyone else go to learn of new stuff before anyone else?

I stress, overthink, insomnia occasionally, etc. I&#x27;ve debated talking to a doctor about going on a small dosage of anxiety meds to help even me out, but I&#x27;m concerned that if the medication helps me not worry so much that I&#x27;ll lose my attention to detail and drive to make sure that I have all of my bases covered on projects. Anyone have experience with this?

Now we are looking to change the status of those users from Enabled to Enforced, without using conditional access, since we don&#x27;t have Azure P1 license for every user. Doing it manually will be a long and tedious process. Any guidance how to go about modifying status of those Enabled users in the csv file to Enforced would be appreciated. What&#x27;s the best way of doing this in PowerShell?
 Thanks!

                              <span>burner account for obvious reasons.... Blue Shield of California&#x27;s leadership has decided that they should outsource the current on-prem IT Infrastructure support to save money. The plan was to transition the IT infrastructure support including compute, virtualization, storage, backup, all operating system support and network to Infosys. They figured they could complete the transition in less than 6 weeks. It&#x27;s been almost 12 weeks and it&#x27;s a disaster with just a few days left before most of the employees are let go. Most of the new contractors lack basic IT skills and any real fundamental understanding of how to manage the various platforms that power a $5+ Billion company. Some people have been retained(after applying for new positions) to preform the work of forklifting our 7K+ servers and applications to the public cloud. They are Fing around at level 10 right now and are fixin to find out.

 TL:DR I coasted through my few years in helpdesk and didn&#x27;t apply myself to learn relevant skills, now I&#x27;m in a position where I realize how much I don&#x27;t know, but that may be moot in the current environment I&#x27;ve found myself in.
 Pretty freaked out- I&#x27;m looking to rant, get some insight and perspective. Participate in some comraderie. Hopefully this post will also provide catharsis. I understand how often these posts pop up and how tiring they are for some people to see.
 Short time lurker to this sub- though it&#x27;s been frantic, I feel like I&#x27;ve gone through every discussion about everyone who has been in this same position.
 First time poster. On Reddit. Ever.

                              <span>In my company I am also occasionally responsible for first and second level support.
 Regularly, when colleagues call with a problem and I pick up the phone or go to the employee&#x27;s desk, a mysterious IT miracle happens. 
 The problems are gone, everything works and the employee is stunned.
 Most of the time they say things like, &quot;That&#x27;s not possible, I&#x27;ve tried it dozens of times and it didn&#x27;t work. Now you&#x27;re here and it works!&quot; &quot;It didn&#x27;t work a moment ago!&quot; &quot;What did you do?&quot;
 This &quot;phenomenon&quot; (for which I unfortunately don&#x27;t have a name. I am open to suggestions here.) really fascinates me.
 Of course, it could simply be that my colleagues just want to annoy me.
 I will probably never know, but I wanted to find out if it happens to you too.

                              <span>While patching my server today, I found an invalid certificate created on January 2nd of this year that wasn&#x27;t created by me. The Exchange HealthChecker script is what brought my attention to it.
 Here is a link to the certificate&#x27;s general tab: https://i.imgur.com/eMQF8xo.png
 Is this an indicator that my server has been compromised? Before the holidays, on December 14th, I fully patched our server and ran multiple vulnerability scanners including the Exchange HealthChecker script and no vulnerabilities were found. This certificate or any other indicators were not present.
 Here are some steps I&#x27;ve already taken to check for IoCs:
  
Checked AD and no administrator accounts or groups were created
 Checked SonicWALL logs and although I&#x27;m not the best at reading them, nothing stands out
 Ran full malware scans using BitDefender GravityZone, KVRT, and Hitman Pro with no hits on any of them
 Checked for new GPO settings
  
​
 EDIT: Thanks to u/axweld. The cert looks to be associated with the Dell ISM. I&#x27;m still looking to see if there is a way to prevent the cert from being seen as invalid, but my question above was answered.

                              <span>A couple of days ago I posted on here about about NTFS permissions , asking if there was an easy way to sort things rather than going through folders and files 1 by 1.
 I’ve now been told by our MD that he wants to get rid of all security groups and add every user individually to files and folders, he also wants it go as far down as file access and not folder. So you can access a folder but not all documents in it.
 They have no understanding of what I do at all, this is something that I fundamentally disagree with but am fighting a lost cause.
 It seems he worked for a company before that was like this , where all Users had visibility of properties.
 What’s everyone’s thoughts on permissions? Am I the one in the wrong state of mind?

 ​
 I&#x27;m looking for both technical and social advise, since I&#x27;m about to face something that probably many of you faced before.
 ​
 Hostile sysadmin takedown.
 ​
 This is the situation, this place had a systems team with 0 management, which seems to slowly descended in &quot;we fix the last fire and then follow with next fire&quot;. This been the normal the last 5-6 years, minimum.
 ​
 At some time, the company grewth enough or had received enough bullshit that they fired the supossed director, who was absolutely not acting as director, as seen by evidence like &quot;we never had a budget before&quot;.
 ​
 This let a team of previously ill-managed of sr admin, jr admin and support to become not-managed-at-all.

 It looks like their willpower and selfmanaging skills were l…</span>

                              <span>A little back story. Two positions back, I was a Senior Platforms Engineer. I’d been managing and then designing our Kubernetes infrastructure from 1.2. It expanded into “owning” all the clusters from Development on out into Production. I kept them updated every quarter up to 1.22.
 I’d also been exposed to CI/CD processes and automation. I’ve done shell scripting for many many years in order to keep an eye on the environment and we were looking into tools. I’d eventually selected Ansible for the team but the environment has so much tech debt that some systems didn’t work with Ansible.
 Anyway, I wanted to move into a CI/CD type role, a DevOps role. I checked with Engineering management and no openings (I will note that there has never been a Unix admin that moved into Engineering from Ope…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys,
 im learing about ssl/tls certs at the moment. I read a few articles, but they state very different things in every article.
 One article says there will be a warning in your browser if certicate expires, that the connection is not secure anymore. I know this error, if a website forgets it there is this typical browser warning that my traffic is not encrypted. But if i accept the risk i can still visit the website. Yes still bad, but not a 100% outage as i understand-
 Another article says there can be outages, but didnt go into detail more for some reason. What is meant with outage in this context technically? When i can still visit a site with accepting the risk its not a 100% outage right? 
 Maybe this is refered to some backend service when there is a expired ssl certificate? I read a story where Epic Games had a real outage of services because of exp ssl cert. Is something like this meant when talked about outtage?
 What is technically happening when there a outtage cause of ssl exp? Maybe a dumb question but im still learing :)

 I have this weird issue with my windows VMs.
 Every two weeks or so, the VM&#x27;s disk space just gets unallocated.
 Then I need to log in to the machine, delete the recovery file, and reallocate the disk space. 
 This is reoccurring for the 4th of 5th time now. 
 Anyone experienced something similar and might be able to help me here?

                              <span>Hi, I’m pondering whether there’s any benefit in getting rid of tier 1 in favour of self service for end users through kb/faq and crowdsourced (colleagues) support. In this way I can just have my team members dealing with stuff that actually requires privileged access. I’d look to bump my l1 guys up to l2/l3 in terms of access/skills and look at using an agile self management approach for all operational techs where they all have the same knowledge and can do the same jobs creating a bit more speed of delivery, greater ownership and a better end user experience as a result. I’ve read a bit about this approach and think it could really work well in my own org but interested to discover how it works in practise from folk working in teams that work this way and from senior it execs who have put in place a similar methodology.
 Cheers
 GD

                              <span>Hi all, we’ve got 2 Servers (A and B) HP DL360 G10 with Server 2019 installed and they are part of a cluster. All drivers are up to date, NICs are Broadcom and Inntel in teaming (1x NIC of each per Teaming). When connecting to them via Hyper-V Manager it takes a long time and sometimes gives up connecting to B, A is fine. When it does connect to Server B, the console takes a long time to connect to any of its VMs, about 1-2mins sometimes.
 Any of you have this issue before?
 Thanks

                              <span>A long-time close family friend and sometimes client has asked for some advice on bringing their office into better shape. They&#x27;re pretty technically competent and have set up most of this themselves. But for the Mac user auth stuff, I&#x27;m not sure where to go. The environment is pretty simple, I think. It&#x27;s certainly simpler than my home environment anyway.
 ​
  
Proliant ML30 G9 running TrueNAS Scale
 NUC7 i3 running Server 2016 (domain controller / AzureAD sync)
 UniFi AP&#x27;s and switches, running RADIUS auth against AD for wireless
 7 users
 5 Mac Studio&#x27;s
 2 iMac&#x27;s
 iPhones and iPad&#x27;s.
  
They also have 8 licenses for M365 Business Premium.
 In a perfect world, they want to sign into the Mac&#x27;s via the M365 email &quot;like you would in Windows&quot;. The Proliant is getting replaced, likely by something that will hold 8 drives, either QNAP or TrueNAS. The domain controller also has to go. RADIUS auth is meh, they could take it or leave it.
 They did look at Apple Business Essentials, but a D&amp;B number is needed, and for whatever reason, they are refusing to give theirs to Apple. I know them well enough to know that they will burn down the building before they will budge on that. Which is a shame because Azure AD federation.
 They also don&#x27;t want to mess with an MDM like Intune. Simple central user auth for both the clients and the file server. That&#x27;s it. Except Mac.
 I looked at Jump Cloud and it seems like it might work, but I&#x27;ve always just bound Mac&#x27;s to AD and moved on with my life.
 Does Jump Cloud seem reasonable or are there better options for what seems simple enough?

Are tape-based hardware backups still recommended today?
 Do you need an active license with the provider to be able to recover from tape backups? I&#x27;m totally new to this, I wonder if I read some nonsense around the net.
 Do tape-based backups need to be brand specific? Eg. Dell servers with Dell backup, IBM with IBM...

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;m wondering how my fellow sysadmins manage / store / use passwords and what are your practices. 
 Do you use just one password everywhere? Do you use a password per site? Random? Or derived from something you can remember? 
 And where, if anywhere, do you store those passes? Do you write them down on sticky notes then stick them on your monitor? Into a text file? Or do you use one of the plethora of password managers out there, and if so, which one and why? 
 Myself: Used to use LastPass until a couple years ago when I exported everything, wiped everything I had there... And moved to a self-hosted Vaultwarden server + Bitwarden clients on my devices. 
 It&#x27;s completely free (discounting the RPi at home I use for other stuff as well), I get to keep all my passwords somewhere I know of, and as I only access the Vaultwarden server over a Wireguars tunnel (without exposing anything else to the public internet), I daresay it&#x27;s also decently secure. And completely free! With all the good jazz like &quot;Military grade encryption&quot; (lol), multi-platform, 24/7 access.

                              <span>I have a data drive on a Server 2016 box where the permissions have got messed up with default permissions removed and changed on the root of the drive so I&#x27;d like to reset the permissions on the entire drive from the root down so it has the same permissions as a new and freshly formatted volume.
 I could go into advanced permissions and try and mirror the permissions that show on a new volume though I also think I should be able to do this using ICACLS but I can&#x27;t find a definitive syntax on how to do it.
 Problem as I think I see it is ICACLS can reset down a folder tree from a parent but there is no parent for the root of the volume to inherit from.
 Does anyone know please?

 So this picture is of the app backups, they were restored from a shadow copy as per the title. But when I went to restore the apps, I entered the correct encrypted password using adb and it didn&#x27;t restore? I think it&#x27;s corrupted.
 I entered ./adb restore app.backup
 Any ideas on what I can do? Has the encrypted password changed or is the whole file corrupted?
 Thanks.

                              <span>i&#x27;ve had a very popular antivirus suite on my mobile for about 2 months now and it has never flagged any app or files for malware and im wondering if they work at all. I have 4 high risk apps that i believe could have been flagged even as suspicious but nope the AV says all is good 
 i have done indepth scans of my phone and SD card and yep no issues 
 the only use that im having for this app is the time based call filter which i haven&#x27;t found anywhere on the playstore in any app 
 google play protect is buit in and already scans apps and on top of that Samsung&#x27;s device protection(powered by macfee) which is also built in scans for malware also so do i really need another AV app 
 lastly do these mobile apps scan for android malware only or they can also detect windows malware

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Network Engineer for a Municipal ISP. I was doing some research on replacing our DHCP servers running on Windows Server with ISC Kea servers.
 How are you securing the access layer and authenticating CPE DHCP request?
 We are using XGS-PON. Currently, when a CPE sends a DHCP request, it just hits the DHCP relay agent and gets assigned an IP from the DHCP server. I&#x27;d like to implement some type of DHCP authentication, perhaps using RADIUS.
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>I was wondering if I were to set up a captive portal on a network and a mobile phone were to connect to it, could they just set up a hotspot on their phone using my network to bypass the captive portal on other devices they own?

                              <span>I&#x27;m volunteering with a smallish local preschool/elementary school with their internet services. They currently have an expensive Meraki firewall, Meraki switches, and 12 wireless access points. They also use VOIP for their main phones. Overall, it&#x27;s a fairly simple system, just designed for teachers and administrators to use (not students), and for their phone service, which needs to be able to prioritized. There&#x27;s no internal website, no guest access, no cellular backup, no real filtering needing, etc.
 They are being asked to pay over $5,000 to renew their Meraki license and in the short term, this is a tough request for them, especially as the Meraki hardware is over 6 years old, if not older (the switches are nearing end of support dates), so it may need to be replaced soon anyways.
 It seems that they could get by with Ubiquiti or Aruba Instant On hardware for much less, and work with a local IT company for support on a much cheaper level if they need it and I&#x27;m no longer able to help.
 Am I looking at this wrong?

                              <span>How could this command create issues when pinging google from host?
 Scenario being:
 ​
  
host connect directly to ISP router and get&#x27;s DHCP from there.
 host can ping the 2 routers and the virtual IP as well, and vice versa.
 Tried with different hosts and various interface configs.
 ISP is using two routers for redundancy, one being Fiber and the other being LTE.
 When Fiber is up, the host can ping the internet.
 When Fiber is down and LTE is up it cannot ping the internet, the router is a cisco C881.
 The LTE has a default route created to direct all the traffic to the LTE interface
  
​
 After the troubleshoot we identified that the culprit was the command &quot;ip route-cache cef&quot; on the vlan that for some reason was not letting the host get to the internet.
 ​
 Mind you, i don&#x27;t have much knowledge on networking, right now i am studying for CCNA.
 So if someone could explain what can cause this and why i would gladly appreciate.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I originally posted this to the wrong community here: https://www.reddit.com/r/lossprevention/comments/10c4cye/dlp_with_jupyter_notebookdatalore/ Re-posting here as it seems a bit more appropriate.
 I am looking for some advice on possible solutions to allow ML developers to access either Jupyter Notebook or Datalore in a secure environment while enforcing DLP to prevent sensitive data from leaving the environment. We access the environment via AWS user VPN which then traverses a site-to-site VPN to the environment. We considered using AWS Workspaces for this, however it does not play well with our external IDP. This has us back to the drawing board on solutions.
 First, I&#x27;m curious if anyone has personal experience with this using AWS AppStream and what up/down sides came with that. What I am unclear about is if I can use AppStream to connect to a Jupyter or Datalore instance running on-prem across the S2S tunnel or will it only work with SageMaker in the AWS VPC?
 Second, I&#x27;m open to any other solutions. What was attractive about VDI and AppStream is that we can control copy/paste and file transfer. But, with workspaces and our current IDP we can&#x27;t get MFA enforcement working.
 Thanks in advance for any help. Happy to answer questions if my goals or explanation are not clear.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m an avid tech enthusiast that has some networking skills and overall decent at troubleshooting and maintaining systems for myself and friends. 
 Yesterday i just found myself in a position (due to an emergency) where i&#x27;ve become full time paid sysadmin for a small company, and i need to basically redo everything in the network and have a properly secure environment. 
 The setup is relatively simple, 5 workstations connected to an Avid Nexis storage server, 2 NAS units, one from synology ( and one i forgot the brand), and old Macintosh used for archival to LTO tapes and everything is connected trough a switch. 
 I kindly request some advice on where to start to properly fix up the network ( everything currently is on default passwords) and how can i identify all possible network connections such as FTP servers, network shares, so on and so forth, is there any kind of software than can find these sort of things? 
 Also i was requested to make all the workstations non admins ( windows 10) and to create a separate admin account, how could i make it in such a way that i can provision settings to all machines from a &quot;central&quot; machine, so i don&#x27;t have to go to each machine and do changes in case i want for example change all their desktop wallpapers to a blank gray, so on and so forth. 
 Sorry if this is long winded and seems like something simple, but i&#x27;ve never done anything like this and i would love to get some feedback and help from people that actually know what they are doing!

 The Domain Controller is a windows server and the VMware Log Insight is located on a Linux server.

                              <span>Today I learned that when you make a signature in the naming format for Outlook roaming signature functionality, like so:
  
My Signature ([jblow@contoso.com](mailto:joe@blow.com)).htm
  
The email address is case sensitive.
 For whatever reason, a lot of our org&#x27;s email addresses (accounts) are capitalized on first and last initials, so [JBlow@contoso.com](mailto:JBlow@contoso.com).
 So you can copy the files to %appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures all you want, but unless the email in the file name matches exactly the case shown in the email account, Outlook won&#x27;t find them locally.
 Now back to finding goat farming courses at my community college...

                              <span>I recently took over IT for an architecture firm with a very simple AD environment. Their domain and file server are 5+ years old and are due to be replaced. Instead of spending a few thousand dollars on upgrading the aging hardware I&#x27;m considering migrating them to Azure AD / Intune as they have mentioned moving to the cloud. This could be beneficial from a management perspective as well as no hardware costs and potential hardware failures.
 Their current setup:
  
Domain Controller - Windows Server 2016 
 Used for very basic AD functions and DNS (DNS would be migrated to the Fortigate). Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.
 
 File Server - Windows 10 machine
 Microsoft 365 Business Standard licenses - Outlook &amp; Office apps
  
I am unsure of the best practices when it comes to migrating everything over smoothly. The client heavily uses AutoCAD &amp; Revvit and stores all of their files on the file server, so its unlikely file storage would be moving to the cloud but I would likely upgrade the file server or replace it with a NAS. They use Fortigate VPN to occasionally reach the file server from home to access these files. Will I run into any issues if we keep the local file server and move them to the cloud?
 Would you recommend migrating this client to the cloud and if so what would be my best course of action? From what I&#x27;ve gathered it sounds like a fairly simple process, upgrading the Microsoft 365 licenses to Business Premium, setting up AAD, Intune and Autopilot, either saving their profiles with Profwiz or wiping their devices, joining to AAD and letting autopilot do the work. Am I missing anything?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have the following scenario:
 I have 2 servers without an extra storage appliance. One server should be productive and the second one should be a backup node with asynchronous replication. The hypervisor will be MS Hyper-V on Windows Server 2022.
 I plan to connect both servers (they will not be in the same room) with a Broadcom 10/25GbE over glass and two 48G port switches with 4 x SFP+ 10G uplink connected via glass to each other. The exact switch model has not yet been determined. 
 The HBAs in the servers have two ports, both of them will be used. 
 The clients will be connected via the 1G ports on the switches.
 ​
 On the hyper-v will run services like fileserver, dcs etc on vms.
 ​
 Will this work and did i forgot anything?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 ​
 I hope seek your advices as i am looking around for alternative solution to integrate logs with Exchange Server Admin Audit Logs.
 ​
 is there any way we can send Admin Audit logs to the SIEM collectors? What is the ideal solution for achieving this?
 ​
 Hope to hear from you all soon!

                              <span>Our new CTO hates it because he can&#x27;t disassociate it with File Replication Service (FRS) that was sucky and got depreciated. None of us ever had an issue with Namespaces until he was hired. He wants it gone, and go back to one file server path, using symlinks if we have to reference another storage server.
 Trying to remove it will break uncountable automations, scripts, save paths, previously opened documents, and shortcut targets! 🥲

                              <span>Title: IT Manager - however, I feel like it&#x27;s more accurate and honest to call myself a systems administrator because I don&#x27;t currently manage any humans. This is a solo IT gig.
 Current salary: $81k (yes, I know it&#x27;s low by most people&#x27;s standards in HCOL areas)
 Experience: 21 years, 13 at current job
 Location: US Midwest (city of ~100,000)
 Job situation: 130 staff, soon to be 140. 5 locations with most of the staff at the primary location. Very little remote staff, mostly onsite. This is technically a 24-7 operation (overnight is minimal) and I&#x27;m expected to be generally available to answer calls, but nights &amp; weekends happens rarely...like maybe once or twice a month I&#x27;ll get a call (very chill place). We are a Microsoft / O365 business with an on-prem 2-node Hyper-V cluster that runs 9 VMs. Pretty standard SCCM, WSUS, DCs, fileserver, certificate services, SQL, Sage, UniFi networking gear, and I manage the PBX. We outsource printers and AV systems. Otherwise, everything gets squished into my job, which I honestly like (I know some of you are ready to pounce and tell me I&#x27;m nuts). Also, I don&#x27;t want to leave this job &amp; only plan on working a few more years. My gut says $90-100k
 Edit: should have included that I&#x27;ve researched salary ranges for my area. Sysadmin with 15+ yrs experience range in my industry is $84-126k.

 I&#x27;ve in IT for about 5 years. Worked as a contractor, doing desktop support related positions before getting my first full time position at a local healthcare org. It was a Desktop Support position, assigned at a hospital. Anything from assisting remote teams, to PC repair and training staff. The manager of the team, (Let&#x27;s call him Mike) worked directly in the role I was taking up, so he had a pretty good understanding of the expectations, and our interview went really well.
 After about a year, I got into a senior role. Assigned to a physical location. This time I got access to program phones, as well as training staff, and handling the higher tier tickets. During this time I was also …</span>

 Prelude: A quick summarization of the original posts: I&#x27;m a one-man IT Department and I was asked to revamp our factories manufacturing processes by the president. I said there was no way I could be a production engineer at the same time as IT. The president then told me that production was more important to the company at the moment and that it was okay if i stepped off IT, and that end users could figure out issues themselves.
 Update: After one day of being &quot;fully removed&quot; from IT it was clear that end users could not figure out shit themselves. The president then asked if I could work on engineering and IT but only T1 help desk level IT issues. At this moment i knew i was bei…</span>

                              <span>Hi Friends!
 Wondering what is everyones favorite ticketing system? We are looking for an internal one for keeping track of support requests from our employees and proactive maintenance tasks tracking for our equipment. 
 Nothing fancy and hopefully inexpensive. Does not have to be free. 
 In the past I have used:
 Microsoft CRM
 Salesforce - (Too expensive)
 ServiceNow - (too bulky) 
 It would be good if it had integration with Teams, so people can open tickets using Teams chat, or emailing in or using a website to fill out specific information.

Anyone thats gone through the process on getting it as a civilian with no military background, how did you go through the process or even start it? What im reading is your employer needs to start the process for you but if you cant get hired if you dont have it how do you start it?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ve been asked for some advise for a small company who need to access a shared workstation while offsite or working from home. 
 They have about 8 ish users who all need to access the workstation. Currently they are using TeamViewer which is pretty overkill for what they need. But they need x2 concurrent sessions at least. 
 Anyone know of any other unattended remote access tools which are simple yet secure? 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve checked the major ones, AnyDesk, CW Control, but again I think I&#x27;m still thinking too overkill lol 
 Any recommendations on smaller / less know apps would be great. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all,
 a months days ago, I read about rport in an administrative magazine.
 rport.io
 And yesterday, one of my coworks came to me, and told me about that thing again, and that some of his collages that are working for an MSP are using it, for customers that don&#x27;t have Itune or anything like that, and don&#x27;t want to pay for it.
 So I was wondering, Is anybody using it as an alternative to other RMM Tools?
 Are you using it on Servers or clients? And do you use it to access infrastructure on client side? 
 And what is your opinion?
 Thank you for your opinions :)

                              <span>I have a laptop with Windows 11 Pro installed with VMware workstation 16 pro installed on it.
 I get this error when I try to start an EVE-NG virtual machine (nested virtualization) in a VMware workstation &quot;Virtualized Intel VT-x/EPT is not supported on this platform.&quot; 
 I have intel virtualization enabled in the BIOS.
 I know this is a known Windows/VMware issue and I haven&#x27;t tried all the possible ways on the internet to resolve it.
  
Disabled Hyper-V
  
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
  
Removed Hyper from Turn on/off feature in the control panel.
 Turned off virtualization-based Security from GPO
 Turned off Memory Integrity under Windows Security
  
Is there anything else I am supposed to do? Please give suggestions. Virtualized Intel VT-x/EPT is not supported on this platform.

                              <span>Hey folks,
 We use a bunch of tools at work which have audit logs (office 365, nextcloud, whatever), and I&#x27;ve cobbled together some tooling to fetch all those audit logs and store them in a centralized DB for easy access and reporting.
 This works reasonably well, but requires a bunch of scripting on my end to integrate new tools, and I&#x27;m lazy.
 Are there any solutions which can tackle this problem for me? A bit of googling didn&#x27;t turn up anything interesting, but maybe there&#x27;s a specific term for this of which I&#x27;m unaware?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have to create a domain account with higher privileges, and I&#x27;m not able to set up MFA for this account, but sometimes it will be needed to use the account for RPD sessions etc.
 However, my idea was to set up a script, that generates a new password on the DC for this user, every 10 min or so.
 The same script would run in my password manager to create the same password at the same time. So I&#x27;m trying to implement a TOTP like thing there.
 My problem is, that I have to set up some kind of shared secret, so the generated passwords will be the same on both sides.
 And that&#x27;s the point, is there a way to do this, by storing the initial seed somewhere on the DC where nobody can access it? Since seed + script &#x3D; access
 Is there maybe another solution for this kind of problem?
 ​
 Thank you all

                              <span>Hi,
 I am part of a small business that got our leader&#x27;s laptops for work. We currently have them set up with Kaspersky Endpoint Security Cloud and using Scalefusion for MDM/remote access. The computers are all set up with an Administrator account and a user account. The leaders only have access to the user account and we used the administrator account for any installs that need an override.
 We have both Windows (dell) laptops and MacBook Airs.
 We use Google Workspace for our files/email.
 We are looking to leave Kaspersky and go with a different AV vendor but are not sure of a good option. We also went with Scalefusion because they had an option for remote access with being able to track the computers and make sure they are up to date etc.
 I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on anything we have missed currently and if there are any better options.
 I was looking into Eset Protect Advanced and Splashtop instead of our current setup, but I believe I would be losing tracking and the ability to lock computers down if lost.
 Please feel free to ask any questions or let me know if you have any thoughts or ideas.

 If so how do you stay up on this task? We&#x27;ve reached a point now where it&#x27;s 30-45mins a day sifting through all of this.
 Are there any tools out there that can help parse said emails and look for anomalies?

                              <span>I have a Dell G3 3590 running Windows 10 Education with bitlocker on.
 Yesterday, I did a firmware update using Dell tool downloaded from Dell directly, and also a Windows Update. I suspect one of these removed the Boot Record for Windows. It has already happened twice in the past like a year ago, and I don’t remember how I fixed it those times because the troubleshooting process was long, chaotic, and grueling—with multiple dead ends every time. None of the googled solutions were working.
 The drive itself is still getting identified just fine, but booting into it does nothing. Before this happened, boot selection (the one that you access by hitting F12 on startup) had two records for the drive: the drive itself and Windows Bootloader. Now it’s just the drive itself (“UEFI I: PC SN520 NVMe WDC 512GB, Partition 1”)
 How do I repair the Windows Bootmanager entry? I would appreciate any help.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi there
 Wondering is anyone familiar if this Active-Passive template from Fortigate (below link), updates UDR&#x27;s in Azure on failover ? .. Or do the firewalls themselves choose an active cluster member , therefore at any point in time there would be only one firewall responding to load balancer health checks . 
 I&#x27;m not a fan of updating UDR&#x27;s on failover which is another Active-Passive option that Fortigate provides, should Azure be in some weird brown out state and UDR&#x27;s / Public IP&#x27;s fail to move - and have noted the requirement to use SNAT&#x27;ing on the Active-Active Fortigate template when using Expressroute etc.
 Hoping that the below template is reasonably simple in terms of failover, whereby the moving pieces are just the firewalls themselves electing a primary cluster member to respond to the Load balancers pointing at it - but not sure.
 ​
 Wondering if anyone has experience with it?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello
 I recently switched to IPv6 my infra. However one of one network is connected to Internet with an IPv4. The ISP does not provide IPv6. Of course when I tried to connect to my IPv6 via SSH it failed. I understand that should create kind of tunnel 6to4 on my SSH server. Am I correct? If yes, how can I create one knowing that my SSH server is behind a gateway that&#x27;s only IPv6.

 I have USB drives that are all recognized on EX switches but all my SRX4600 aren&#x27;t recognizing them. running &quot;ls /dev/da*&quot; and nothing. Is there a special way to find and mount connected USB drives? Anyone know? Thanks

 Config: ! Conf t ! Ip prefix-list INTO-AREA7 seq 5 deny 0.0.0.0/0 Ip prefix-list INTO-AREA7 seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 ! Router ospf 1 Area 7 filter-list prefix INTO-AREA7 in Default-information originate !
 PS: I solved the issue by using EIGRP instead of OSPF, but would like to know if there is a different way using OSPF.

                              <span>Long story short, I&#x27;m trying to push traffic through a VM firewall on GCP with a windows machine. They are on the same private VPC but for some reason cant communicate with each other. I set a default Firewall rule for them to communicate on GCP (default allow internal) where I&#x27;ve allowed all protocols just for kicks/testing. Is there anything else on GCP im missing? I&#x27;ve created static routes in the firewall but the way GCP does routing is a little odd from other platforms (AWS,AZURE) from what I&#x27;ve heard from others. Any advice would be great please. Thank you !

                              <span>A customer of mine has a managed network firewall, router, and switches I installed a while back. I found that another tenant of the building, who has the right to use the network, put an unmanaged switch off one of the ports of our managed switch that has a VLAN assigned specifically for them and put their own router on the other side of the unmanaged switch.
 so: Managed Switch Port &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Unmanaged Switch &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Router &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; endpoints...
 I think the unmanaged switch will flatten the traffic between our managed switch and their new router. Are there any adverse effects on the managed network?

 I know this traffic is not going to go anywhere and is most likely being dropped at the first ISP router.
 My question is, should I create an ACL that will drop/block traffic destined for 169.254.0.0/16?
 It won’t break anything right? Is there a legitimate reason to route AAPIPA?

                              <span>I was wondering what retransmission timeouts look like in the context of playing videos. Will it just cause video playback to freeze and resume once a packet is received and an ACK is sent back?

 For the 5 months I have been struggling to get the client, and my &quot;Manager&quot; to understand we do not just give out our security compliance protocols. They want way, way too much information in areas I have no business knowing about... like our disciplinary system for failing to do required training. Don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t fucking WANT to know. HR shit is a 3rd rail with 10K volts and pointy sticks.
 They want it in their format, and they want me to do it. I explained many times to them over the last year, here is the link to the 3rd party security audit report it should answer all the question you need. Joe Bob is your designated contact, he ca…</span>

                              <span>Backstory is that after a particularly grueling week, I applied for a Tier 3 position at a very prestigious local institution.
 Fast forward a few weeks, I&#x27;ve got an offer in hand. It&#x27;s 5k more than my current base salary. I am still reviewing the other benefits, but the allure of the institution is a big big draw. There is also the potential for significant career growth.
 On the other end, I feel personally indebted to my current boss for various personal reasons; he&#x27;s the reason I have the job I do currently. We are already understaffed at my current job so leaving would put some people I care about in a pretty crappy situation. In addition, the year-end bonuses and small perks at my current job are way better than the offer I have.
 Has anyone had a similar experience where you feel like a jerk for leaving, and how do you deal with it?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll make this quick. I&#x27;m sure most of us are aware of the Microsoft ASR shortcuts missing problem today, even if you were not impacted. I woke up this morning like any other morning and while scrolling through Reddit in bed, I saw the first few posts of the problem being reported. That sure was a wake up call. 
 Thanks to the OPs, commenters with solutions, and others chatting, I was able to &quot;fix&quot; and reduce the impact of the problem before everybody starting showing up. My org has tens of thousands of devices and employees. This problem would have been a nightmare to handle. Thankfully, because of those posts and comments, I was able to stay 2-3 hours head of Microsoft&#x27;s response, which saved us. It&#x27;s very rare, but we were able to set up full resolutions and responses before users started to call us with problems. Overall, we had a few thousand devices impacted, but it only ended up being around 35% or less of our total fleet. Still bad, but it could have been sooo much worse. I know I can&#x27;t be the only one in this boat.
 Talking with multiple Microsoft employees (Support, fast-track, devs), they asked me to link to the Reddit posts that I quietly brought up when I said it was a global issue. Congrats to those OP&#x27;s! Your posts have been seen by everyone! It looks like Microsoft is currently working on solutions to help with impacted shortcut files so only time will tell at this point.
 Again, big thank you to everybody, from the OP&#x27;s to the people leaving comments. Even the lurkers up voting topics. Today is one of those days where I&#x27;m thankful that a community like this exists. If you had this problem at your organization, I wish you a speedy recovery. If you didn&#x27;t, enjoy this time to relax before the next big problem comes through. Cheers.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have a partial solution for companies that had partial deployment of the ASR definitions that removed shortcuts. This script will crowd source the shortcuts from your machines and deploy them. There are some security holes in this process as any local admin would be able to use this to deliver a file to each of your desktops, so you may want to remove the &quot;robocopy&quot; line and populate your store manually.
 To make this work, there are a few assumptions:
  
you are on a domain
 you have a folder setup that &quot;domain computers&quot; can write to (or read if you are populating manually
 The script can run periodically to get any updates other computers have contributed (if not populating manually) You can achieve this by running as a scheduled task running as system delivered with a gro…</span>

I think the nodes will only be used to host runtime engines. We currently only use Windows for our servers and nobody on my team has any in-depth Linux experience. 
 My only experience with Linux has been Kali, Ubuntu, Tails, and Parrot. Do any of y&#x27;all have a favorite Linux distro to use as a server? Anything that would be useful to a Linux novice such as myself?

E.g., Equipment that is malfunctioning, what you were trying to accomplish, troubleshooting steps already preformed. If anyone has implemented something like this what details did you require? Did you find users putting in less tickets because of the requirements?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been here 7 years. 6 healthcare-related companies at 3 locations, 100 users. Only IT person. I&#x27;m at $60k and I asked for $100k on Wednesday. Rural South. He balked but said 3 times he didn&#x27;t want to lose me and only once that he didn&#x27;t know if he could afford me. 
 Yesterday I find out he&#x27;s talking to an outsourcing company next week. I talked to an outsourcing company today for an hour. Didn&#x27;t get a price yet but they tried to convey it&#x27;s expensive AF, and would probably still require an onsite tech. Called me a unicorn 3 times. Will know more early next week.
 Today my boss gave me a $9k bonus check applied to last year. Oh, and I applied for 4 jobs yesterday and have an interview with a top employer on Tuesday.
 Roller coaster. Do not be afraid to be vulnerable and dare greatly, my friends.
 P.S.: Graduate next semester with my CIS degree after working on it for 4 years part time, while raising my young daughter full time the last 7 years.

target.lnk files contained within any Network Locations
 Some start up items are now missing (likely linked to the missing app shortcuts)
 Public desktop shortcuts for various applications may be missing.
 Start Menu items (user or system level) may now be missing.
 Pinned documents and recent lists may be missing items
  
Has anyone noticed any others? Is there a log of what it removed? I can&#x27;t seem to find any logged entries for ALL of the .lnk files it wiped.

                              <span>You need Edge and Chrome and other programs back but don&#x27;t want to copy from another computer? Great, use this script and add in all the programs and the shortcut link that should normally exist for them. 
 If you need to, also exclude the program from copying to the user profile. For Edge and Chrome, I opted to try both the 64bit and 32bit directories. Most of your company programs that only reside in the 32bit dir (Program Files (x86)) will only need one entry.

                              <span>TLDR; HP is a terrible company with terrible support. Never ever buy anything from them or use their services. We have had a number of negative experiences with them in the past year.
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Having an issue with 2 servers that have external disk shelves connected to them. Each server has close to 60TB of data stored on these external shelves. They&#x27;re in production, and actively serving customers. The two servers and all 6 shelves are covered under a support contract with HP.
 On December 14th I opened a ticket with HPE Support using the serial # of one of our servers which is under support contract. After a month of back and forth regarding firmware / BIOS updates required on the servers, and sending numerous AHS logs, and doing a bunch of un-related troubleshooting, the support engineer tells me that they can&#x27;t do any more and I have to open a case up using the disk shelf&#x27;s serial number.
 Why couldn&#x27;t you fucking tell me that at the beginning!! Instead HP support wasted a month of our time. Days between responses on a ticket that is marked as &quot;Critical Degraded&quot;. Stressed us out over the holiday&#x27;s causing several of us to have to work over the holiday&#x27;s to run CHKDSK on the volumes, and worrying that our data might get lost. All so they could turn around and tell us to open a ticket with the storage team instead.
 God damn HP, you fucking suck. Never EVER will I buy HP hardware or products again.

                              <span>Hi
 I just by coincidence read about it. Microsoft is changing from using the Windows root store, to a build in trust list, starting with version 110, and the GPO will be removed in 111. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnote-stable-channel#version-1090151849-january-12-2023
 We have a lot of internal tools we use, all validated by our Windows CA root cert. 
 Am I misreading this, or what are you guys doing about it? 
 We of course use public CAs for our DMZ/public stuff, but internal websites, it&#x27;s so nice to create a certificate for 10 years. 
 Have have been lazy so far and Just need to get with the page and start using &quot;real certs&quot; or ?

                              <span>Have you ever had instances where a stakeholder is dead set on using a particular vendor/solution?
 We have one of our stakeholders that is fixated on this one solution for her team, which will connect and integrate to one of our business critical systems. This system is one that me and my team are responsible and own. She doesn&#x27;t really come from a technical background, but my former boss (left the org) told her 3-4 years ago that this solution isn&#x27;t going to meet our needs or work well. We&#x27;re being forced to integrate it and have serious concerns about performance/stability impacts. The vendor&#x27;s implementation team doesn&#x27;t seem all too concerned and during one call the consultant started whining like a child that we were delaying the roll out. She seems to be siding with the vendor and pushing aside any of our concerns. It&#x27;s just a frustrating and stressful situation overall and one of the many drivers that&#x27;s causing me to consider new roles.

                              <span>Hello. I hope you can give me some pointers, as i&#x27;m still inexperienced with Network Hardware. I have a HP 2810-48G Switch (J9022A) and i&#x27;m task with updating the firmware. As far as i understand i connect to the console port and log on via putty.
  
Am i using the right cable? I have a USB-RJ45(?) and a Serial-RJ45(?) cable. I guess it&#x27;s not really RJ45, as it doesn&#x27;t fit. Or can i use a normal network cable?
 
I have the MAC of the device (printed on the back) but not the IP to connect to. Can i scan for the correct IP or is there some kind of default?
 
Anything else i should know, handling switches?

                              <span>Hello, our small computing cluster has 3 computing nodes and 1 file server. The file server has around 70TB data to be accessed by the 3 computing nodes. All of the 3 computing nodes have 3 4TB SSDs which are now idling.
 Currently the computing nodes use NFS to access files on the file server, and all the servers are connected to a 1 Gbps network. Is there a proper way to create a &quot;pool of cache&quot; from those SSDs so that there is no need to always access files from the file server? Or is it even a correct solution, or should I just stay with local SSD cache?
 I have tried to set up GlusterFS with those SSDs and FS-Cache on top of GlusterFS but it caches nothing.
 Thanks.

 As always, PMs welcome with your questions any time, not just Fridays.
 This weekly thread is here for you to discuss vendor expectations, software questions, pricing, and quotes of services, licensing, support, deployment and hardware. Last Post: January 6th.
 Required Info for accurate answers:
  
Part Number - of utmost importance
 Manufacturer/vendor
 Service Type and Location
 Quantity (as applicable)
  
All questions welcome, keep in mind that there are of course more pieces to this IT puzzle we can dig out of the box
  
Cloud Services - Security, configurations, deployment, management, consulting services, and migrations
 Server configs and quote answers
 Storage Vendor options, alternatives, details and selection
 Network infrastructure - overlay software, segmentation, routers, switches, load balancing, APs…

                              <span>What do you consider the lifetime of the HF20/40/60 Nimble SAN&#x27;s?
 None of them are listed as EOL, but some of the older ones out there are 5+ years old. 
 I&#x27;ve always considered a SAN to be good for 4-5 years, before looking at replacing it. Is this still the norm? Or is that pushed to a longer window now? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I was doing some troubleshooting the other day and noticed something very strange. One of my ping replied reported a &quot;time&quot; value exceeding the TTL value. It&#x27;s my understanding this should only ever result in a timeout error rather than a reply, correct?
 It only happened on one of the pings, so maybe this was some weird one-off bug, but I figured I&#x27;d ask in-case I am misunderstanding the ping reply information.

 Has anyone of you managed to control the HDD trays&#x27; LEDs with some CLI software that can be used in scripts? Based on the notification by ZFS for a broken disk I&#x27;d like to people in DC identify it through the blinking LED.

                              <span>So.. this isn&#x27;t a gotchya question. It&#x27;s legit.
 On current revisions of Windows, 10 and 11:
 January 10, 2023—KB5022282 (OS Builds 19042.2486, 19044.2486, and 19045.2486) - Microsoft Support 
 There is a vulnerability in WinRE, that if unpatched...
 🔃 Security Update Guide - Loading - Microsoft 
 What kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability?
 A successful attacker could bypass the BitLocker Device Encryption feature on the system storage device. An attacker with physical access to the target could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to encrypted data.
 Are there additional steps that I need to take to be protected from this vulnerability?
 Yes. You must apply the applicable Windows security update to your Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). For more information about how to apply the update, see Add an update package to Windows RE.
 Are both offline images and WinRE in a running environment affected by this vulnerability?
 No. Only a WinRE image on a running PC is vulnerable. This can be any time a recovery or reset operation is invoked from the main OS.
 ​
 So:
 1) JUST the CU doesn&#x27;t fix it. You have to patch WinRE. Most people won&#x27;t do this.
 2) Since the Windows Recovery environment is not encrypted/protected, someone could just &#x27;replace&#x27; the WinRE.wim file with an &#x27;old, bad one&#x27;, and exploit this vulnerability, even if you patched &#x27;your&#x27; device.
 Have any organizations/anyone else spoken about this? It seems to have effectively slipped under the radar, and while it would be &#x27;hard&#x27; to exploit, maybe, and &#x27;hard&#x27; to replace a WinRE environment... it&#x27;s not THAT hard.
 I&#x27;m not saying &quot;go 3rd party&quot;, by any means, but this seems... bad? Maybe I&#x27;m mis-understanding/reading it, but this seems like, for the current Windows revisions, a &#x27;permanent&#x27; issue.

                              <span>Hi! Not sure if this is the correct sub but gotta try anyway..
 ​
 I have a server with exim on it, it works fine most of the time but it sometimes (once a week or two) it just stops functioning. Now I&#x27;ve found the the issue and the fix, but I can&#x27;t find the cause...
 The issue is the /etc/virtual/pophosts file just dissapears, it gets removed for some reason, and the fix is to just create it once again, simple as that. 
 Problem is even though exim has ~550 pages in it&#x27;s documentation there&#x27;s not a single mention about the pophosts file. After some digging I found that this file contains the IP&#x27;s of user&#x27;s that already authenticated, but nothing about the file deleting itself. Has any of you ever encountered that issue before? How do I even troubleshoot an issue like that?

                              <span>My current title is supportability which pays around 60k a year. My responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
  
maintaining, upgrading and deployment of 20 desktop applications through AWS Appstream once a week
 SME for those applications, contacting escalated customers (tier 3..I&#x27;m the last resort), figuring out root cause and fixing them
 use data analytics to discover and solve widespread issues, for example, getting a splunk report showing how many customers have resource issues that cause performance problems for desktop customers.
 discovering and reporting defects, ensuring that we can reproduce them before sending to development.
  
There are many more things we do, as our team has become a kind of dumping ground for things no one else wants to do or can&#x27;t figure out.
 What job out there can I equate to what we do? I&#x27;d like to start looking for positions elsewhere that pay way more for the stuff we currently do and or go to my HR with information showing that the jobs that we do should be siloed under a different name that pays more.
 Like right off the bat the app stream stuff, I looked up and there&#x27;s something called an appstream desktop virtual engineer and they make 100k!! 
 And that&#x27;s just one of my responsibilities. So I definitely feel like I&#x27;m getting shafted here.

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 I just got first Microsoft Server and I need to license it. 
 First I got so confused by licensing model and I&#x27;m still not sure I get it. So it is 2*24 cores server and it will host 14 VMs, so by my calculation I need 3 Datacenter licenses + required CALs. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.
 Also can I license Windows Server 2019 with 2022 license?
 And can somebody tell me a real price of Windows Server Datacenter 2022?
 On official Microsoft page it says 6,155$, but I&#x27;m finding prices as low as 30$. Is this real? It&#x27;s all kind of confusing. 🤯
 Any help is welcome 😊

                              <span>In the last hour, we&#x27;ve had half our organisation report that shortcuts have disappeared from their desktop and Microsoft Office has ceased working. Outlook.exe has flat out disappeared for some.
 Whilst not logged in Windows Defender-&gt;Operational, if we try to do a quick repair of Office we see that Windows Defender Exploit Guard has blocked the creation of .lnk files
 From what I can see, this appears to be the &quot;Block Win32 API calls from Office Macro&quot; ASR rule malfunctioning, potentially after the installation of AntivirusSignatureVersion 1.381.2140.0
 Is anyone else seeing similarly? 
 One one machine I&#x27;ve changed that rule to audit rather than block and Office repair has since been successful and the creation of .lnk files via our powershell scripts is functioning again..

                              <span>Hi,
 I am wondering about the best practice for a scenario that has been causing problems. 
 I am working in an IT department of a university and in each classroom is a desktop computer for the teacher and it has all kinds of physical equipment for distance learning.
 The computers are domain joined of course but the problem is that the sample rate on the soundcard needs to be at 48khz for all the software and equipment to work correctly.
 When teacher (domain user) logs in to the computer the first time the sample rate is always at 44.100 so it needs to be set manually to 48khz in the soundcard settings. But once it is set it will be correct next time this user logs in.
 So this only happens the first time each user logs in. 
 The soundcards are not the same in each classroom so we are not going to take care of this by some group policy.
 I know about the default user profile settings, but the computers are all on domain but with different soundcards between classrooms. So what I am trying to figure out is the best practice if I can log me in on the computer for the first time locally, set the sample rate to correct settings and then every other domain user that logs in after that will get the same settings. 
 Thanks

 It seems to be blocking from the rule: &quot;Block Win32 API calls from Office macro&quot;.
 Scratching my head as to what it might be..? Any ideas/help would be grateful!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Have you had anyone report applications going missing from there laptops today? 
 I&#x27;ve seemed to have lost all Microsoft apps, outlook/excel/word
 an error message comes up saying it&#x27;s not supported and then the app seems to have uninstalled. 
 ​
 Some users can open Teams and Outlook, and strangely, it seems some users are unable to open Chrome too. 
 ​
 We&#x27;re on InTune, FWIW
 ​
 Anyone else experiencing the same?
 EDIT:
 u/wilstoncakes has the potential solution in another post:
 We have the same issue with the definition version 1.381.2140.0.
 Even for non-office applications like Notepad++, mRemoteNG, Teamviewer, ...
 ​
 We changed the ASR Rule to Audit via Intune.

 But the AppData folder has been setup for folder redirection and wondering if its best to just set this back to point local and not move the files as Ive heard it can cause issues? Whats the best approach for AppData and moving it back without causing too many headaches?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve also posted this in r/networking for more reach.
 We have an Azure AD Domain Services instance running which resides in its own vnet. This vnet is peered with our site-to-site VPN vnet. Traffic is allowed between the vnets and routing gateway is enabled.
 We are able to domain join VMs from the site-to-site vnet to the aadds vnet. However we are having difficulties domain joining an on-prem server over the site-to-site VPN. When trying to domain join we&#x27;re getting a &quot;DNS name does not exist.&quot; error.
 The DNS servers x.x.x.5 and x.x.x.4 are set in the ethernet adapter options and we are able to ping these IPs. However, pinging the domain fails. We have flushed the DNS and restarted the server several times.
 Does anyone have a clue what might be the issue here? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>We have 2x old file servers ( 2008R2 ) which we really want/must get rid of urgently. ( Yes, i know they are very EOL. Not my decision for such late move. ;)) 
 We have already thought about different variants, how we could proceed. Important requirement: For validation reasons, the shares must be accessible under the old DNS name.
 ​
 Variant 1: Inplace Upgrade to 2012
 We do an inplace upgrade to 2012R2 and all shares etc. should still work. The inplace upgrade worked fine on our test server. 
 But our two file servers have a problem with it and run into a never ending bootloop after the upgrade. 
 ​
 Variant 2: New server
 We set up 2x new servers, change the hostnames on the old server. Mount the partitions of the old file servers, import the shares from the registry of the old servers and in the best case everything works fine.
 ​
 Variant 3: DFS
 We replicate the shares with our DFS server. As soon as we are 100% sure that everything has been replicated correctly, we shut down the old file servers. However, I am not sure how we can make the shares accessible via the old hostnames.
 ​
 What is your suggestion or experience?

                              <span>Since I started working at my current employer there has been a lot of patching and fixing various security holes. Guy before me was tech savvy but not comfortable with server environments etc, the age old tale. Without going into too much detail, we have a department which does a lot of development. Until recently, all of these employees (approx 15 people) all had local admin rights (users added to AD group, GPO set said group as local admin on all workstations). Obviously we don&#x27;t want that many admin accounts, even if they only have those privileges on workstations and not servers etc, let alone people who do not work in the IT department. 
 As you may have figured out, this caused some outrage among the developers. We are not big enough yet to have a &quot;functional&quot; helpdesk and utilize LAPS in an effective way so I&#x27;m still walking around approving installs. However, so far that has only happened once since this change was applied. This makes me believe 1. they vastly exaggerate the amount of times they do things that require admin privileges (no surprise) and 2. This is more of a &quot;hurt ego&quot; situation where they are more upset over being &quot;downgraded&quot; than it is an actual issue. 
 Do you think I made the right call or is it overkill? 
 TL;DR: Developers lost their admin rights and are upset. I think it is a major security hole to let an entire department have admin rights. I believe they are more upset of having been &quot;downgraded&quot; than it actually being a problem, but I&#x27;m doubting myself. 
 Thank you!
 P.S I am the only one doing IT and we are &gt;100 people in three countries

 I have a registry that is multi-line JSON and want to return one property from all Value Data so I have to use ConvertFrom-Json to successfully be able to select the object.
 I need to Feed the returned JSON string into ConvertFrom-Json. Then use the returned object from that to pull the data from the JSON field(s). 
 Can anyone assist me please? Shouldn&#x27;t be hard for powershell power users 
 It should look something like this I guess, but the syntax seems to be incorrect 
 Get-ItemProperty -Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\AutopilotPolicyCache&quot; ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty DeploymentProfileName 
 This is how the whole property looks like: 
 {&quot;CloudAssignedLanguage&quot;:&quot;us-US&quot;, &quot;CloudAssignedTenantId&quot;:&quot;000000-000000&quot;, &quot;IsExplicitProfileAssignment&quot;:false, &quot;CloudAssignedTenantUpn&quot;:&quot;email@email.com&quot;, &quot;CloudAssignedMdmId&quot;:&quot;ve9uj38hu3vi8b3&quot;, &quot;PolicyDownloadDate&quot;:&quot;2010-10-10&quot;, &quot;AutopilotServiceCorrelationId&quot;:&quot;ID&quot;, &quot;CloudAssignedAutopilotUpdateTimeout&quot;:1800000, &quot;AutopilotCreationDate&quot;:&quot;2010-10-10:07:24Z&quot;, &quot;AutopilotUpdateTimeout&quot;:2222222, &quot;AutopilotMode&quot;:0, &quot;DeploymentProfileName&quot;:&quot;DEPLOYMENT_NAME&quot;}

 When I install it and go to the fqdn/certsrv page it comes up, however I select my certificate type, and in the next page the &quot;key strength&quot; option is blank, and if I keep going I get &quot; Your request failed. An error occurred while the server was processing your request.&quot; COM Error Info:CCertRequest::Submit: Invalid pointer 0x80004003 (-2147467261 E_POINTER) 
 I&#x27;ve searched around and can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why it won&#x27;t work. Tried 3 servers, and they all do the same thing. Tried standalone and enterprise, tried on a DC and a non DC.
 any ideas?

 Long story short comcast tech gave him a new modem (which his was really old on 192.168.1.0/24) so new modem was on 10.1.10.0/24 so ya know servers are static and end users on different subnet now, easy fixes

                              <span>We have one user where Outlook just stopped working and lost it&#x27;s connection to exchange the day after a password change. It worked the same day as the change and half the next day. This is affecting only this user and I&#x27;ve tried everything that usually solves all the Outlook issues but no luck this time.
 ​
 What I tried:
 - New mail profile
 - Checked that &quot;Offline mode&quot; is off
 - Deleted .ost file
 - Repaired Office
 - Reinstalled Office
 - Cleared Credential Manager
 - Reset the users password
 - Ran Outlook in Safe mode
 - Ran SCANPST on the file
 - Ran the Support &amp; Recovery Assistant
 - Logged in on OneDrive
 - Opened Word/Excel to verify that the correct user is logged in on other Office apps
 OWA works..
 I also checked the sign-in logs in Azure and no obvious errors in there, they are approved and succeeded during the time I tested. If I load the old mail profile Outlook opens but is disconnected, if I create a new profile it stops at the &quot;Loading Profile&quot; and after ~5 minutes I get:
 Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The attempt to log on to Microsoft Exchange has failed.
 Any tips from the Exchange gurus?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 As an apprentice, I have been tasked with implementing a new format for our server overviews. The goal is to make it easier for our team to quickly identify and access the correct server when addressing customer issues.
 I was wondering if anyone could share their experience with server management software or server overview tools that they have found to be particularly effective in this regard. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

 I&#x27;m on a team with 1 other person. We started working about 4 months ago without prior experience in IT, straight out of an unrelated stem uni course. We are working on setting up a virtual Active Directory domain tree - a fake company called CyberCorp with 2 branches, for the purpose of showcasing certain things to new potential clients and as a lab for learning how to do penetration testing. There are a lot of elements to this - setting up email servers, databases, constant replication problems, setting up secure tunnels between company branches and to the outside, firewall, setting up a (physical) switch and…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I was looking forward to setting up some tests with pushing initial configs for IOS-XE devices with Auto-Install.
 I was looking to leverage GNS3 for this…. But I can’t seem to figure out what devices (if any) will boot with auto-install.
 Hoping someone can point me in the right direction?

                              <span>We have a HA pair of fortigates in a load balancer sandwich design (A/P) in Azure, after trying to understand the methods used to perform a 1:1 NAT, there does not seem to be a dedicated guide that goes through each specific step to set this up. 
 First question is regarding HA and the use of the SDN failover. Is this really needed or can the Azure Load Balancer on the external side perform this?
 Next question is when I have attempted to configure this on the External load balancer to NAT to the Gate&#x27;s secondary private IP addressing to a new address, this does not seem to work properly.
 Would love to try and understand how this works exactly and how to properly configure this.
 Thanks!

 If it matters the project involves running cables from the switches into several IoT devices mounted to the outside of the building.
 Are outdoor racks/enclosures a thing?

                              <span>I have two switches, one fortinet and one juniper. both go back up to the firewall. Networking works on devices plugged into themselves when the two switches are not connected. 
 However, I was attempting to trunk the two switches to allow devices on Juniper A to talk to devices on Fortinet B all on the same .10 network (not jumping to vlans yet). when I configure the trunk interfaces and connect the ports, networking starts failing. Juniper A devices cannot seem to talk to Fortinet B devices at all, and Fortinet B devices start dropping packets among themselves. The trunk ports are configured in the same was as those going to the firewall which seem to work. 
 Juniper Trunk Configuration:
 [edit interfaces ge-0/0/0] native-vlan-id 1; unit 0 { family ethernet-switching { interface-mode trunk; vlan { members [ 1 20 ]; } storm-control default; } } 
 Fortiswitch configuration has port 1 configured as a trunk with native vlan as 1 and allowed as 20.
 I&#x27;m also not sure if this is a loop issue but the STP setting is enabled on the fortiswtich, and RSTP on the Juniper
 Juniper:
 # show protocols rstp interface all; 
 Any ideas how I can get this working so devices on each switch can communicate with each other?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I work in a cloud environnement and a client of ours has a backup server where he paid for 5Mbps only. So for the WAN interface of the client toward the server in output i applied some shaping. But we have a monitoring console sending ping and those ping started to get insane latency (3000+ms) and 60 packet loss as a result. So i wanted to exclude ICMP packets from that shaping policy. 
 ​
 Now, this is on a Cisco Nexus 3048 and the config might be a little bit different than some of you are used to. At least that was the case for me. 
 ​
 Anyway, onto the configuration : 
 ip access-list ipExclude 
 permit icmp any any
 ​
 class-map type qos match-all ipExclude
 match access-group name ipExclude
 ​
 ​
 policy-map type qos ipExclude
 class type qos ipExclude
 set qos-group 2
 class type qos class-default
 set qos-group 0
 ​
 system qos
 service-policy type qos input ipExclude
 ​
 class-map type queuing DILITRUST-OUTPUT
 match qos-group 2
 ​
 ​
 policy-map type queuing DILISTRUST-COS
 class type queuing DILITRUST-OUTPUT
 bandwidth percent 50
 class type queuing class-default
 bandwidth percent 50
 shape kbps 5000
 ​
 Interface Ethernet1/12
 service-policy type queuing output DILISTRUST-COS
 ​
 Of course, this doesn&#x27;t work and i tried multiples things but i just don&#x27;t get how it doesn&#x27;t work. ICMP packets should normally be tagged with the qos-group 2 and all the rest of the traffic with the default qos-group 0 and therefore, not be shaped as per the first class DILITRUST-OUTPUT once it matches on it. 
 ​
 But no, it doesn&#x27;t work. Any network engineer here might have an idea?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I would like your opinion about two design that me and a colleague made for a customer. I did design 1 and he did design 2.
 Proposed design-1
 Proposed design 2: https://imgur.com/Eu1tsbn
 The customer have: two fortigate firewalls, two switches and three physical servers for their new network setup.
 Basically, the only difference is the internet connection between my design and my colleague design. He preferred that the internet terminated on the switches instead of the firewall compared to my design (internet terminated directly on the firewall). Unfortunately, he could not explain why (yeah I know.. he said that he have seen lot of customer going for design 2) and I&#x27;ve been trying to research about this but no luck.
 I would like if someone here know why the design 2 is preferred more than design 1. I know that it all depends on the requirements etc.. but just in general, if you would look at both designs, which one would you go for and why? I&#x27;m curious and would like to know both the pros and the cons for both design.
 ​
 Appreciate all your answers.
 ​
 EDIT: For whatever reason, I have issues naming the links from imgur so I will just post the URL for design 2. Apologize for that
 EDIT 2: there is only one ISP link and will just be a default route to the ISP (no BGP). The firewall are in HA mode, active/passive.

 I appreciate any responses.

                              <span>This is a fairly unique and complex question, to me anyway.
 Essentially Site A (main site) has a decent number of workstations on the company domain. The interesting thing is that the networking (and firewall) is provided by a different company with the core being in an entirely different locale. The good news is that in our building, we have a switch in the basement with a few ports that assign WAN IPs. 
 Using this, I set up a pfSense firewall and hooked up to WAN and LAN. At Site B we have a UniFi USG4. I set up an IPSec tunnel between the two, and got as far as being able to resolve the Windows domain from Site B, and ping the (real) LAN gateway but not any further. NO domain controller traffic was able to pass. 
 Basically my thoughts were that since I have access to both a WAN IP, and the local subnet that 99% of our Windows machines are on, I had everything I needed to create a tunnel from inside of the other company&#x27;s network and get our Site B network connected to resources that Site A uses WITHOUT asking the other company to make any changes. (No I&#x27;m not doing anything illegal, nor will this cause issues)
 Am I missing something? Or is it just simply not possible.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not good at Cisco switches, but I need to configure somewhat redundant configuration on two C1000 switches connected to a Comware distribution switch. The idea is: Cisco switches are connected to the rest of the network by Port-channel1 which carries only one tagged uplink VLAN, and connected to each other by Port-channel2 with 2 VLANs: uplink and &quot;user&quot; VLAN. I put the user VLAN in MSTP instance 1, the upstream is in default instance 0. For now spanning tree is blocking uplink port in instance 0 and I can&#x27;t figure out why. It should be blocking Po2 according to plan. 
 SW2#show spanning-tree blockedports Name Blocked Interfaces List -------------------- ------------------------------------ MST0 Po1 
 Could you please give me some advice?
 The network diagram is here
 Important config parts:
 SW1#show running-config
 ! spanning-tree mode mst ! spanning-tree mst configuration name axia revision 1 instance 1 vlan 192 ! spanning-tree vlan 1,816 priority 12288 ! interface Port-channel1 switchport trunk allowed vlan 816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 192 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 64 ! interface Port-channel2 switchport trunk allowed vlan 192,816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 64 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 192 !

                              <span>I’m a vaguely technical project manager (so apologies if some of the terminology is wrong) and I’m curious about what a future enterprise network might look like. Today we have a fairly traditional on-prem design. 2 data centres, some public facing services, VMware, F5 load balancers, mostly Cisco everything else including core switches.
 At each site we have MPLS, and local internet breakout from the same provider as the MPLS. We have Cisco L3 edge switches, and Cisco wireless access points managed via controllers at the DCs. All internet traffic goes out via the local break out, not over the MPLS.
 Most of our end user and public facing services are already in the cloud, with the rest moving over the next 3 years. And the data centres will reduce to a couple of racks of legacy internal and public facing systems.
 Endpoint security will be on the devices (zScaler), and the view is that the office network will end up no more trusted than any other network.
 At that point in 3 years time, my questions are why do we need a WAN, why do we need core switches and routing or expensive MPLS circuits? Then why do we need L3 edge switches?
 In my simple mind we would need reliable managed internet access and WiFi with a management platform. Not even sure if we need much wired Ethernet except for printers and a few other appliances. Everyone has laptops and we don’t have desk phones. Mostly normal Microsoft Office based workloads.
 So would we effectively be no different to a rent-an-office location? What equipment and management tooling do they use? Still Cisco?
 Thanks for indulging me!

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m in a hard spot likely due to a lack of fundamental knowledge in a particular area so I&#x27;m hopeful one of you can explain the issue I&#x27;m having enough that I can find the right language for seeking help.
 The scenario is pretty simple. I am using Python to automate configuration commands to Adtran OLT network devices. Currently, the app mostly works in the sense of being able to issue commands to retrieve information tables for parsing.
 The problem I&#x27;m up against is when I start sending commands back to apply configuration changes, something very weird happens with the CLI which I can replicate exactly through my Gnome Terminal by pasting the same commands that break in the automated interactive shell.
 Here is an example of the command set where the problem starts:
 enable config t shaper “interface gpon 1/0/1@1/4/1.gpon channel 1” 1@1/4/1.gpon rate 500000 exit shaper “remote-device 1@1/4/1.gpon_0” 1/4 rate 500000 exit exit 
 For reasons unknown to me, once the space after the second double quote is sent, the shell does something weird and the command breaks as invalid.
 Here is a visual example of what happens to the CLI in Gnome Terminal which is essentially the same result I see with the automated shell as well: https://imgur.com/a/Id8snAA
 The automated shell is currently using a vt100 terminal type if that helps any. For the record, the command examples provide have been tested directly through a shell on a macOS computer and they work as intended there so the command format is where it should be.
 Any takers on what I&#x27;m missing here?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve noticed multiple Macbook M1/M2 users experiencing network issues when working on Enterprise sized networks.
 It seems to originate from issues with AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link) but this was supposed to be fixed with the launch of Ventura 13.1. 
 Is anyone else still experiencing issues with this or were you able to resolve it? If so, how?

                              <span>Hi
 Does anyone have some knowledge of a 5G router with POE+ output ports integrated in it?
 Also that it can make an IPsec tunnel would be nice. 
 It is needed for a camera where a direct cable is not really an easy way, but power is not an issue.
 It is going to be used in Denmark where 5G data is really cheap :)

                              <span>Hi, everyone,
 I am currently working on a new venture and conducting a market research on the biggest pains faced by network administrators, with special attention to device management complexity.
 We are open to discussions on different use cases, but if your IT department manages LTE/5G-enabled devices, or if you have multiple geographically distributed networks, you might be especially interested in that. We would like to put these capabilities to good use.
 Feel free to ask us further questions in this thread, and we&#x27;ll do our best to answer to each one of them; or, if you prefer, just send me a private message instead.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We have an Azure AD Domain Services instance running which resides in its own vnet. This vnet is peered with our site-to-site VPN vnet. Traffic is allowed between the vnets and routing gateway is enabled.
 We are able to domain join VMs from the site-to-site vnet to the aadds vnet. However we are having difficulties domain joining an on-prem server over the site-to-site VPN. When trying to domain join we&#x27;re getting a &quot;DNS name does not exist.&quot; error. 
 The DNS servers x.x.x.5 and x.x.x.4 are set in the ethernet adapter options and we are able to ping these IPs. However, pinging the domain fails. We have flushed the DNS and restarted the server several times.
 Does anyone have a clue what might be the issue here? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Well, it finally happened. We have a customer who is running two windows servers that have all of their roles bare metal. Remote server is Fileserver, domain controller, app server, FTP server, print server... you name it. Local is a DFS target and a &quot;backup&quot; DC. 
 We all know this is not ideal. I know. Well sometime in the last 30 days, my domain controllers stopped talking to each other. Remote is PDC, other is onsite. They are in separate sites in active directory. The onsite one is out of sync and now can&#x27;t authenticate against the PDC. So all shared resources (printers, mostly) no longer work. Nor does DFS replication. 
 We got lucky on this one. After getting a manual printer mapping going, and trying to do it the &#x27;right way&#x27; to repair the link I said screw it. I demoted the onsite DC, removed from domain and then re-added it to the domain. I learned a lesson there. Also the lesson to set a monitor for the log events for if this issue happens again. 
 I&#x27;m hoping that my RCA of this will finally convince my boss that they need to break out the roles to individual vms and (if I&#x27;m really lucky) get a 3rd DC vm spun up... or just move the app server to an Azure App, remove on prem domain and just do local printer mapping. (its like, 8 users.) 
 Anyway, happy Thursday!

                              <span>Our terminal server has Microsoft 365 apps for business installed and usually behaves well otherwise.
 A handful of users have secondary mailboxes in a separate 365 tenancy with Business Standard licensing rather than our Business Premium licensing which means they can&#x27;t use that license in the terminal server (no shared computer activation).
 In the case of these users, they get prompted for modern auth each time they sign into the terminal server, but the session will then persist during that session between launches of Outlook. If the option is selected to sign into other apps, the other apps will keep that session in future Windows sessions while Outlook does not.
 It seems to be something related to the cross-tenancy situation, but finding information about this has been difficult.
 We&#x27;ve tried downgrading the modern auth for these users by setting DisableADALatopWAMOverride to 1, however the prompts continue regardless.
 Does anyone have any extra insight into this issue?

                              <span>hello, can anyone recommend an ILO/IDRAC like KVM device for rack servers?
 I have a server thats realtively old, Dell poweredge , which has an extremely old version of IDRAC that I cant even login to w/o using old internet explorer, 
 was wondering if I can hook up a KVM-like device to it via VGA, and connect this device to ethernet port, so I can have a terminal login similar to SSH, except it would outside the server itself, similar to how Idrac virtual console works. 
 not sure what something like this is even called. Basically want to emulate IDrac virtual console

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I currently have a Windows Server instance with AD DC and DNS installed that I use for home configuration and testing. I would like to deploy my own Software Center or Company Portal for home use. It will be used by my family as a way to easily install their most commonly used applications. It will also work great as a way to learn how this software works.
 From what I understand, Intune will potentially be replacing SCCM so I believe that&#x27;s the software I would like to use for this test setup with my home server.
 Is there a good guide on how to install and setup Intune so that I can get Company Portal working? That is, unless you guys think I should go with SCCM&#x27;s Software Center instead.
 Thank you all for you insight.

                              <span>I just started a help desk job with zero training and I’m the only person for 4 weeks. 
 They are asking me to issue replacement computers for the staff. The staff wants all their old files, web browser favorites and everything to be the same on the new computer. 
 I’ve been copying the user profile with /c$ and remote into the two computers for the transfer. 
 from one computer to the next. But it’s usually like 60 gigs and takes forever. 
 They have their own file share drive. Which i shouldn’t have to transfer/copy 
 Is there a faster way? I assume the only thing I should have to transfer is everything that’s not in their personal drive ?
 I’m lost here lol Definitely regret taking this job

 Not sure what the best approach is. As is users in our organization use over 4000 different pieces of software. No way I have time to review all of that.

 Any tips?

                              <span>So I had my performance review, and I scored (3.5/10), where five is average. I have had issues with my boss in the past, he is known for picking on employees and had complaints before. I have a couple of peer evaluations (8) and self evaluations, but none of that data was in the supervisor evaulation. Long story short, my boss gave me low marks across the board and cited this as his summary. &quot;namiiscool23 attitude towards his new supervisor (had him only 3 months) and lack of professionalism needs to improve, had it not been for this his performance would be much higher&quot;
 I put in ALOT of work and have great peer review, my boss is not technical and does not understand DB administration. So I challenged my evaluation because my peer evaluation, where I picked leaders and people I work with closes gave me high marks. Even my old supervisor gave me good marks. I brought this up with HR and now they are launching an investigation on my Boss. It is worth nothing, that he had 2 people leave this year and I talked to one of the people that had the same experience I am facing. On our call, he said he felt isolated and nitpicked for flaws. But his evaluation was not harsh as mine, this individual was surpised by my score too.
 They want to interview me and asked for me not to talk to my old boss or boss&#x27;s boss. Any advice?

                              <span>The last couple of months have been brutal… Similar to a lot of the posts I have seen on here as of late, our company has dropped WFH and everyone has been dragged back into the office since November. Big surprise, this has led to our companies productivity to drop for a variety of reasons; not to mention, the amount of pointless interruptions that come up. 
 The company size is around 40-50 people; although, we have been hiring a bunch of new team members from December. This month alone, we have 6 to 8 new employees that we have to on-board and HR completely dropped the ball on our team coming back from holidays last week. For some reason, we have around eight women in the HR department, where realistically, around three of them would be enough for the work they do (IT Department: 5 of us…</span>

By way of background, previous to my current role I used to work in a large financial institution in a pretty unique role dual hatted role. Which means I was doing two jobs as a contractor supporting a long regulatory project making sure certain IT MIS capabilities were in place, and if not to support developing new capabilities. One of our teams new years resolutions was to stop swearing so much, even instituting a swear jar. On to the story...
 The project we were working on had a regulatory deadline so there was no room for slippage, stress levels picked up and frankly there was a shit ton of swearing. One of the higher-ups walking through our area noticed this, and therefore suggested th…</span>

 For those who may need this information: a Linux user account that utilizes key authentication and has a null password can stop working because of an expired password.
 I don&#x27;t want to get into all the things I checked, but here are a few:
 Authorized keys Manual sftp connections Firewall rules Sftp Log files Event viewer logs Networking Program reinstall (on a windows server acting as a relay of sorts) NTFS file permissions
 So, imagine my face when my coworker says &quot;the password was expired on the Linux server&quot;
 I need more coffee. I&#x27;m sure some will find this laughably simple, but I&#x27;ve learned a lesson. Check password status first, takes 2 seconds and can prevent 2 hours of wheels spinning.
 Happy Friday eve nerds

 another question for you which I am sure is easy to answer for most but I am new to the IT game and wanted some insight. COO tasked myself and another IT guy to come up with the best strategy of how to create a network access storage device into our current network. I don&#x27;t know much about NAS but what I do know is the parameters I&#x27;m working with are 1. Needs to be able to be only touched by a few individuals who have the credentials to access what is being stored on the NAS and remote VPN into it. 2. NAS company cant be apart of China, Russia, or Middle East related company due to the storage on the device. 3. device will need to have redundancies of course.
 My questions are, should the device be placed on a subnet on the already established network at the HQ? Should a separate network be created that only houses CUI related items to ensure that the storage device can have added security measures that the main network does not implement?
 ​
 Thanks for any help in advance we are heavy in the research phase.

                              <span>Hi, everybody. What are you using to automate remote connectivity to your company&#x27;s network? We used DirectAccess for years, and it was pretty reliable. Eventually, it broke, and because it&#x27;s deprecated, MS refused to help us fix it (the no IPv4 issue was also a point of contention, but we worked around it). So, we moved to Always on VPN configured to connect to our Sonicwalls. Unfortunately, some users complain of frequent connection drops, and for a significant number of people, the &quot;Always on&quot; functionality just isn&#x27;t there, they have to manually connect it.
 Ideally, we&#x27;d like a machine based VPN that connects before login (like DirectAccess), so thinks like SCCM can function without an active user. Are there better options out there that are tried and true?

 What&#x27;s the purpose of Hyper-V in Win11?
 Is it just for virtualization or some advanced features in Win11 require it?

                              <span>Is anyone in here currently using Microsoft AVD at all?
 We&#x27;ve been using it with one of our clients for a few months now and we have this issue that occurs for maybe 10% of users. 
 Their setup is like this: Dell Wyse 3080 Thin Clients with AVD/WVD package installed. We have an MFA policy in place to prompt for MFA every 12 hours. This is working and users are being prompted every 12 hours but this is where things get strange.
 90% of users will then be served the desktop shortcut on the thin client and they will be able to access that with no issues, but some 10% of users don&#x27;t get the RDP desktop shortcut, even with successful auth. Has anyone experienced this and have any idea what we can do to resolve?

 We have a small team at my company
  
IT Director
 Network Admin / Sysadmin / Cyber Security / Jack of all everything- Me
 Helpdesk Tier 3
 Helpdesk Tier 1/2
  
We do not have a CISO or anything like that but we do have things in place to keep it protected, however... If say an incident does get reported to us (phishing attempt, unauthorized access, ips issue etc etc) we don&#x27;t really have a workflow in place. Is anyone else in a small team like ours and if so how do you handle this process? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>This is going to sound like a huge security risk but I’m doing it for testing. I have a radius network that authenticates through NPS and I have a couple users setup. They can login just fine. I want to allow those login with verifying credentials but allow anyone who’s username provided contains “user” without verifying credentials even if their password is wrong and don’t have an account. I have a connection request rule in NPS that will grant any user the access Whos username contains “user” and it will wont check their authentication. But I can’t seem to get the network policy to work to assign them a vlan. Can someone provide me with assistance?

Using emails below is just silly and not an option. sales1@example.com sales2@example.com sales3@example.com ... How do you enable 15 people to work normally and use sales@example.com email without errors? On many companies we are also forced to reduce the amount of personal emails to the minimum and use service name emails like service@example.com, accounting@example.com, kitchen@example.com, engineering@example.com ect and many of this departments have multiple users that would need to use this email and they usually have a set of clients that they usually work with.
 Do you have any trick how to solve this hard problem?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have written my own bespoke software app to automatically keep track of IT assets as they roam around the company buildings. This takes data from a solarwinds SQL database which I then use to link into various other databases we have (SCCM etc etc).
 We can track computers to each room if staff ever move them.
 Does anyone know of another tool other than solarwinds we I can use to export a list of which MAC address is connected to which switch port? I&#x27;m looking for something a bit more efficient, and solarwinds isn&#x27;t always reliable.
 I&#x27;m sat looking at a PC now which is connected to the network, but solarwinds says it isn&#x27;t lol

                              <span>So a little bit about myself
 I&#x27;ve been building/repairing/troubleshooting my computers for many, many years. I&#x27;ve always been the &quot;computer guy&quot; among friends and family. I&#x27;ve gotten my A+ Cert (this actually expired, but I did it), and my Security + cert, currently working on my Microsoft admin cert. I can do basic programming in JAVA, C#, and Python. I&#x27;ve built quite a few computers over the years, I&#x27;ve troubleshoot a ton of issues. I did once work in a PC shop building/repairing computers when I was a teenager but now I&#x27;m much older. I&#x27;m pretty good at figuring out solutions to my problems. 
 The job is help desk however I&#x27;m kinda wondering am I really prepared? I guess you could call it imposter syndrome? The person who hired me says he&#x27;s confident, but I&#x27;d like to hear about others and their first IT job experiences.
 My end goal is I think I&#x27;d really like to be a System Admin, or director of IT. I know I don&#x27;t want to be anything like a software dev.

 Externally this is possible as the connection to the ADFS comes via the Application proxy (WAP) but internally its failing to connect and prompting for credentials vai Forms type prompt.
 does anyone know if it is possible to pre-authenticate the chromebooks so they can access the IDP login page without getting the Forms prompt.
 Thanks

                              <span>I normally use a pre-made template by me to create user accounts on office 365, after that i manually go into their profile and add them to the group.
 is there a way to specify the groups as well on a template? because when im on a leave, i dont want anyone calling me asking which groups they should add a new manager and what not.

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I know this isn&#x27;t really a thing anymore, but I have a requirement to map network drives on non-domain accounts on a handful of pc&#x27;s.
 I always used to do this with a scheduled task login script - but that&#x27;s proving to be unreliable these days.
 Does anyone have any ideas how I could get some local user accounts to reliably map a domain mapped drive with domain credentials.
 This is for a non-long term necessity so can script the login temporarily.

 Is this something that can be disabled for all Windows users on laptops via Active Directory/Group policy -im not yet familiar with administering Windows Servers i&#x27;m L1 User Support 
 So in our work network all work laptops, work desktops, and user&#x27;s personal cellphones use Static DHCP addresses. We allow user&#x27;s personal cellphones on the staff network for communications. I have however noted that some users avoid formally requesting for their personal cellphones to be connected to the staff network so they just create mobile hotspots off their Windows work laptops when they come in to work and connect their phones. Some users bring extra devices e.g home laptops, or they get visitors and just do the same to get a connection. We do have a guest network in place.
 Is this practice a security risk, something to worry about and can this be blocked

                              <span>I think this is the right community for this topic, but if you think there is some other more adeqaute sub reddit, please tell me.
 I am in the process of migrating our Hpe StoreVirtual (LeftHand) VSA cluster to a new (and supported) solution.
 Our HCI infrastructure is a basic two nodes stretched cluster, in a network raid 10 configuration. These two nodes are in two different CEDs rooms, connetcted through a 10GbE fiber cable. LeftHand has proven to be a reliable solution in these 8 years we used it.
 The only (big for me) cons I have toward Hpe is the support policy: if you do not have a valid maintenance contract, no one besides hpe personnel can gain access to the OS in case of problems. I mean the OS of the StoreVirtual virtual machines that &quot;do the magic&quot; abstracting the local storages and make them visible to the vmware cluster as a (one or more) vmfs shared datastore(s).
 Our reseller strongly advised us to move to Hpe SimpliVity, because that&#x27;s the natural step forward basing on our specific topology. SimpliVity too has the (big) limit above: once it will go EOSL you will not be able to gain access to the &quot;ninja&quot; console in case of troubles.
 Personally, I gave a look to Vmware vSAN solution and I proposed it as an alternative to my reseller. They discouraged me for the following reasons:
 - VMware vSAN solution is not natively fit for a two nodes stretched cluster. It born for a three nodes cluster, and in order to cover the gap with other vendors, it later adapted the solution to work with two nodes solutions as well.
 - vSAN does not have the &quot;data locality&quot; peculiarity. Data blocks for a given virtual machine are written across the nodes, independently from where the vm is located. SimpliVity, as opposite, has this advantage (inherited from StoreVirtual VSA after all).
 Do you agree with this analisys or the reasons cited above are weak and vSAN is in any case a better solution for my cluster topology?
 Thank you,
 Francesco

                              <span>Hey guys. How do you handle all the CVE&#x27;s? How do you know which CVE&#x27;s are really relevant to you&#x27;re organisation? There are at minimum 50 new CVE&#x27;s per day, so how do you keep an overview over all?
 Maybe I think of creating a script which is extracting all our software to a list with which I can search through a CVE Database automatically.

                              <span>Anyone have any advice or best practices for creating resilient network file shares?
 I have 2 machines directly connected, and they each share a read-only NFS folder with each other. It&#x27;s important that the mounts don&#x27;t go stale and can automatically connect despite the boot order or unforeseen temporary disconnections. E.g. if computer 1 boots first, then it should connect to computer 2 NFS whenever computer 2 comes online.
 At the moment i&#x27;ve achieved a workarond using a &#x27;@reboot&#x27; cron script to clear stale mounts but it bothers me that i have to do this. I imagine there&#x27;s a proper way for this since I imagine it must be a common problem.
 Thanks for any suggestions!

                              <span>Hi admins,
 Has there been any change recently in how MS/O365 forwards emails? 
 We&#x27;re relying on email forwarding from our support address to another mailbox to create tickets, it&#x27;s been working fine until now, but all of a sudden the original sender information is no longer kept, and all tickets appear to be raised by our support address.
 any input is greatly appreciated 
 edit: corrected typo, punctuation

                              <span>I am working in a Regional Health Sector with a system that has patient information. We are developing a new version of the system and i, as a DevOps am responsible for the topological design. Even though our application servers are on a somewhat private network it is IMO still not secure enough since everyone in the organization connected to the network can possibly sniff the traffic.
 We have an application server, a database server and an AMQP server. Sensitive data will flow between these servers so i need to encrypt the connection. I use a rather simple docker setup, because i don&#x27;t think the application is big enough to justify k8s or other orchestrators ATM. 
 I have thought of two solutions: 
  
TLS configured directly on the AMQP (RabbitMQ) and SQL (MySQL) servers. I have heard, and seen benchmarks that shows a rather significant performance impact.
 Create a wireguard-based overlay network (netbird, tailscale or something else) to use for all traffic between services.
  
Have any of you solved similar issues, or just have some thoughts i am listening.

                              <span>Hiyo
 It&#x27;s my turn to perform the IT orientation for a new C-level user. Other exec&#x27;s have been promoted from within, so they got their IT orientation when they came on board as manager, rank-and-file staff, etc. This person is new to the organization.
 My usual orientation involves a bit of a discussion on how to get support, how we handle IT assets, where to find important data, important distribution lists and groups in outlook, where to find printers, brief conversation about IT policies (and where to find and agree to them), and so on.
 Specific LOB tools are oriented by other groups - HR does the bit about payroll tools, finance/purchasing does their bit about procurement, and so on.
 It occurred to me that this is probably more finer detail than this person needs or wants. I was thinking that I should probably keep high level - save your data &quot;here&quot; (OneDrive), we use Teams as a communication platform, here&#x27;s how you get support...
 If you&#x27;re the new executive to a company, and you&#x27;ve got ~30 minutes of an IT orientation, what&#x27;s the most effective use of that time?

                              <span>So we had some bad storms today and Spectrum was down. Of course, this had my business without internet. I was wondering if there were any viable mobile hotspots that would run an small office. We have items like temp monitors and other various items that need to be able to send out alerts if there are variances.
 Thanks in advance.

One of the first things I wanted to do was create a MGMT vlan for network devices since everything is essentially in the same lan. However I find myself struggling to get it working. I have tried everything I can think of and i&#x27;m left scratching my head.

 Sonicwall Firewall (VLAN interfaces are created here) LACP Trunk to the Core switch --&gt; Core switch has vlan 100 tagged on uplink trk10 to sonicwall --&gt; vlan 100 has ip address attached to it. 
 On the sonicwall I have a temp rule to allow all traffic from our LAN to Vlan100. 
 Currently I am able to ping and ssh to 192.168.8.98 (expected), I can ping 10.10.100.11 but I cannot ssh to it, running n…</span>

                              <span>We operate roughly 20 co-working spaces and are looking for network monitoring solutions to help us with the following
  
monitor service incidents between our ISPs and popular SaaS platforms. 
 Potentially alert on scenic routing or peering problems
 
 Monitor wireless local area network experience. Like if the RF environment is congested. 
  
Unfortunately we do not control the network so we need as many data points as possible to hold our managed service provider accountable and track down issues (hopefully) before our end users realize.
 So far we have been exploring Netbeez, Demotz, Obkio, and Accedian. Since we don’t manage end user devices and there are tons of different devices (co-working environment) there isn’t an easy way for us to install an agent on peoples machines. Thanks in advance to any ideas or suggestions.

                              <span>On the back of my ASA to AWS site to site VPN I noticed when I trace route from my HP switch (Acting as a layer 3) to the internet it skips the ASA firewall (next top):
  traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 hp2920.x.local (10.10.10.1) 0.812 ms 0.771 ms 0.748 ms 2 10.10.6.2 (10.10.6.2) 2.221 ms 1.638 ms 1.228 ms 3 50.x.x.x (50.x.x.x) 3.362 ms 2.699 ms 3.020 ms 
 The ASA is 10.10.2.2 which is the default hop for the HP switch - Config portion in question:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.2.2 vlan 3 name &quot;Core Switch to Firewall&quot; untagged 1/34 ip address 10.10.2.1 255.255.255.248 exit 
 The Network layout:
 Server(10.10.10.32) -&gt; (10.10.10.1)HP2920(10.10.2.1)-&gt; (10.10.2.2) ASA (10.10.6.1)-&gt; (10.10.6.2)Palo Alto (50.x.x.y) -&gt;(50.x.x.x)Fiber gateway... 
 Why is the ASA (10.10.2.1) not in the traceroute list when the inner edge of each firewall/switch/gateway is listed.

                              <span>I have a dozen buildings connected via a fiber loop. Each building has a Cisco switch (either 3850 or 9500), and is connected to the buildings on either side of it via layer 3 links (EIGRP).
 I also have 3 of the buildings that need to be tied together with a layer 2 link, carrying multiple vlans.
 Currently I have the layer 2 fiber strands connected to a separate set of switches, so the multiple vlans can be trunked between those buildings.
 We had a consultant come in to examine our network, and he says we don&#x27;t need the extra switches - the Cisco switches have more than enough bandwidth to handle the layer 2 traffic as well as the layer 3 traffic.
 I agree with him about the capacity, but I don&#x27;t know that I can have a layer 3 trunk AND a layer 2 trunk between the same switches. If I was only using a single vlan on layer 2, I&#x27;d just connect access ports on each switch to carry the same vlan between the switches. But since they need to be trunks carrying multiple vlans, I didn&#x27;t think I could do that.
 Am I wrong? Is there a way I can do both on the same switches?

                              <span>Hello Folks,
 I&#x27;m attempting to identify the command that will output both the IP address of hosts connected to the Cisco switch and the interface to which that IP address belongs.
 Background: We have several VLANs in our company, and someone asked for a different IP address so they could access particular resources if they had the IP from the designated subnet. To enable him to obtain the IP from the network, I would only add the interface to the relevant vlan. I know his IP address, but how can I tell which switch port his machine is now attached to?
 Many thanks,

                              <span>Getting set up to finally replace our 6509 pair of core switches (VSS) and replacing it with a Nexus 93360 switch pair. It seems that the N9k&#x27;s do not support standard access-lists??? I currently have two standard access-lists, one for RO to snmp(v2c) and one for RW. For example:
  
ip access-list 25 permit 192.168.0.1
 ip access-list 26 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.3
  
Since the nexus does not allow standard access-list, and we need these exceptions made, I need to convert them to extended? I am guessing something like
  
ip access-list 25; 10 permit ip host 192.168.0.1 any
 ip access-list 26; 10 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.3 any

                              <span>Is there an explanation available somewhere that goes into detail about which NAT type (full cone vs symmetric) is best used for what types of traffic? I&#x27;m familiar on how each works just don&#x27;t know when to actually use one over the other. Also is one considered more secure than the other (my assumption is that symmetric would be more secure, but is it ... not that NAT should be relied on instead of a firewall)?

                              <span>Had a discussion with a couple of our techs on where to flip the duplex of the patch cable. The cables we get are all straight and we need to flip the pair on one end when completing the connection. We have always done it at the up stream end, right at the switch and keep everything straight through downstream, but our new guy is insistent it&#x27;s better to do it furthest away from the core.
 We really have never put to much thought into it outside of being consistent.
 Where do you guys flip your patch cables? Head end, far end, somewhere in between (why?)?
 Thanks, 
 Hope you all have a wonderful day.

                              <span>Hi,
 i need a little help regarding MPLS vpn. I want to have redundancy in case any of the PE routers go down the l2vpn should work. WHat do we need to do in this case? do we need to have multiple xconnect? if we do have multiple xconnects do they need to use same VCID? will spanning tree come into play? i don;t have any idea and never did that. 
 here is the diagram. please give some high level hints on how to achieve that?

                              <span>a doubt about ipv6 address, in theory they are more than 1×1036, or more. Obviously, not even 10% of this was used, and then the unused ones, how does it work to take advantage? Can anyone get an address for themselves, or can only ISPs request IPv6 addresses from their region&#x27;s IP governing body? and how does this authentication work? what prevents someone from taking an address that has not yet been authenticated? I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m asking something obvious. thanks for listening

                              <span>Hello
 I set up a virtual lab where I am testing multicast.
 I am pinging 239.1.1.1 from a remote host (there is full unicast reachability end to end).
 The first ping or 2 works, but then the rest fail.
 On the final layer 2 connection from the switch to the end host, I noticed that for the pings that work, the destination MAC is the correct 01005e 010101 but for the ones that don&#x27;t work, it sets the MAC to 01005e 00000 (but still with the correct IP). I assume that the end host (a IOSv router) would not be expecting that Mac so just ignores it. In the middle of a ping test, it appears to randomly change the destination Mac on the packets to the incorrect one.
 I am just wondering what could cause this? It&#x27;s a vIOS switch.
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve started working on a telecom service provider company, and my job is the assurance process for multiple mobile services among those is the Private APN service (if you dont know what this is, its basically a custom name tag for your mobile connection so that the service provider can route you to your private network)
 ​
 Honestly I feel lost, there is not much info on the internet about the subject, and the company only started to provide this service since 2019, so there is no experts on the subject. 
 ​
 What I&#x27;m working on right now is a proactive approach for monitoring this service, and I just don&#x27;t know what to look for, all of the in built alarms/systems/indicators we have are for monitoring the core network as a whole, and nothing i can find is APN based or even single customer based.
 ​
 So on the slight chance that anybody here works on the same thing as me, I would like to meet them

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on building a new lab, and I&#x27;m one of those weirdos who actually wants their lab to represent a production environment. The thing is... I live in vendor-land and it&#x27;s been years since I actually worked on a production network. I know that Cisco best practices have been to implement 8/12-queue QoS model; however, I&#x27;m wondering how many people have actually implemented such a thing, given that MPLS providers have traditionally used a 4 or 6-queue QoS model. 
 For those of you who work in environments that have built solid QoS policies, wha model are you guys running with? My inclination is to implement an 8-queue model in my lab... however, if that is not likely to reflect the &quot;real world&quot;, please let me know and I&#x27;ll do it differently.

                              <span>90% of our servers are dev servers and we have about 100 of them (Vm&#x27;s). WE had sccm which was covered under our gold partnership but we lost gold because MS sucks. Our laptops are covered by intune anyway and it just so happened we had a catastophic failure and lost our main sccm server. We actually could restore it but we have lost of lot of the licensing for it and dont really need it anymore as we only used it for updates and laptop deployment. So it&#x27;s only windows updates that is the issue now. I cant seem to recall where I setup the gpo to point to the internal ms server aka sccm. I need to undo this and for now have them all go to the internet until I get wsus setup for servers, I&#x27;ve tried rsop and everything and cant seem to find the right gpo to change this because rsop shows that it is the local policy where this was set. Doesnt the domain policy overwrite local. Do I need to remove ccm etc before it will work. SCCM is a weird beast to undo

                              <span>Mainly posting because I know professionalism is important, but I don&#x27;t think my hair would cost me a potential position.
 The quick story is that I&#x27;ve got an interview with a very nice job that&#x27;s networking related, although the job description is more of a jack-of-all-trades type description, which is perfect for me. This is in a school district, so you MUST be professional. 
 I&#x27;m 20 with some &#x27;hippie hair&#x27; (Down to my shoulders and poofy-like, very neatly kept), and my Dad&#x27;s really wants me to get the position as well, but he keeps insisting I get an almost military cut, saying &#x27;You Need To Play The Game&#x27; and to &#x27;Grow Up&#x27;. I&#x27;m an avid Homelabber, and since my interview is over zoom, I&#x27;m hoping that will be the strong point in winning them over, I really doubt they&#x27;ll pay my hair second mind, but anxiety&#x27;s getting the better-half of me, so I wanna know how it would affect how if you saw a candidate with professional looks, all boxes ticking but they &#x27;look like a stoner&#x27;.

 (Sorry if this isn&#x27;t appropriate mods, I&#x27;ll remove if wanted.)

                              <span>I am facing a situation in which I might need to extend an evaluation license for VMware ESXi 7.0.3 U3 as well as vCenter Licensing. Just wondering if anyone is aware of a trade secret to accomplishing this. The environment is a non-production testing system, but will ultimately have a proper license applied.
 A quick google produced this method: (appears to apply to versions below 7)
  
Start the SSH service on the ESXi host
 Start a SSH connection with a SSH client (e.g. PuTTY)
 Delete the current license:
 rm -r /etc/vmware/license.cfg
 Copy the new license:
 cp /etc/vmware/.#license.cfg /etc/vmware/license.cfg
 Restart the VPXA service:
 /etc/init.d/vpxa restart
  
Just wondering if anyone&#x27;s actually done this before and can provide some insight.
 I need to maintain access to Vcenter and the ability to Vmotion, and power on/off vm&#x27;s for possibly another 60 day eval period.

                              <span>I&#x27;m setting up a centralised syslog server using rsyslog, and so far I&#x27;ve got the server set up to receive syslogs from remote hosts on 514/tcp, which sends the logs from each host to /var/log/remote_syslog/%SOURCE%/%YEAR%/%MONTH%/%DAY%/syslog.
 This isn&#x27;t the worst thing, however I&#x27;d really like to be able to split out the received logs to the same log files as they are on the remote end; i.e. /var/log/messages from host1 goes to /var/log/remote_syslog/host1/2023/01/12/messages, /var/log/secure goes to /var/log/remote_syslog/host1/2023/01/12/secure, etc.
 My config for the receiving end -- the server -- looks like this:
 template( name&#x3D;&quot;file_server_template&quot; type&#x3D;&quot;string&quot; #string&#x3D;&quot;/var/log/%$YEAR%/%$MONTH%/%$DAY%/%SOURCE%.log&quot; string&#x3D;&quot;/var/log/remote_syslog/%SOURCE%/%$YEAR%/%$MONTH%/%$DAY%/syslog&quot; ) *.* action( type&#x3D;&quot;omfile&quot; dynaFile&#x3D;&quot;file_server_template&quot; dirCreateMode&#x3D;&quot;0750&quot; dirOwner&#x3D;&quot;root&quot; dirGroup&#x3D;&quot;root&quot; fileCreateMode&#x3D;&quot;0640&quot; fileOwner&#x3D;&quot;root&quot; fileGroup&#x3D;&quot;root&quot; ) 
 And the config for the client:
 *.* action( type&#x3D;&quot;omfwd&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;&quot; port&#x3D;&quot;514&quot; protocol&#x3D;&quot;tcp&quot; StreamDriverMode&#x3D;&quot;0&quot; action.resumeRetryCount&#x3D;&quot;100&quot; queue.type&#x3D;&quot;linkedList&quot; queue.size&#x3D;&quot;10000&quot; ) 
 The closest I&#x27;ve come to splitting the resultant log files on the remote end is using %PROGRAMNAME% in the template, but that doesn&#x27;t preserve the structure of logging to messages, secure, etc, instead it logs each program (e.g. sudo, su, crond, rsyslogd, etc.) to its own file, which is not exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.
 I can&#x27;t find any example configurations which achieve what I&#x27;m trying to do, hence I&#x27;m asking here in case anyone has figured it out. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey All,
 I need to migrate our Azure Connect from our old server (Windows Server 2012 R2) to our new one (Windows Server 2022).
 On the old server it&#x27;s currently running version 1.6.16.0, will I be fine migrating with the export import method without doing an inplace upgrade first?
 I believe support ended for versions below 2.0 a while ago, whoops...
 Thank you

                              <span>We have all been asked the question where they ask you how much do you want to be paid when you have interviewed. I found the &quot;best&quot; answer for it that has worked really well for me. As soon as I am asked that question, I ask &quot;what is budgeted for the position?&quot; That turns the tables on them and they need to come up with an answer. A lot of the time they do not want to name a number hoping you can be gotten cheaply but this changes it into your favor.

 Basically they now when you click a link through the Outlook app, you get this BIG GREEN BUTTON advertising you to try Edge...
 I can see most senior users clicking that without even thinking twice about it.
 How is this even allowed?

                              <span>So what online services have you guys run into that you explicitly block without question, Similar to Grammarly.com which sends all of your data and when you read their ToS/Privacy Policy and non-existent encryption specs policy will lead you to lose sleep.
 Looking for anything else everyone has run into that could be a potential security risk. My infrastructure is a .gov dealing in municipal services to include Law Enforcement and Fire/Medical data, we are always looking to stay on top of or in front of threats.

                              <span>Title. Am I screwed? Talked to microsoft support said we couldn&#x27;t do anything after an hour. Panicking right now. Just wanted to hear yells opinions before I break the news. 
 UPDATE: After an hour working with a microsoft support we were able to retrieve the mailbox and downloaded inboxes into PST files. After importing one of them, it is not showing many of the emails. It is only showing the deleted emails, nothing in the inbox, nothing any where else. I am still searching online for answers. Possible it is corrupted?
 I still have the back up plan of loading the OST file from the user. I have a question about that though. So the email/outlook login is on a different domain profile, so the user has only logged into the new domain profile. Is that OST still safe, as long as I disconnect from the internet and then login to that user account. Also, will that OST file have ALL the emails?!?
 I would like to thank everyone for their input. I really want this nightmare to be over lol

See the software isn&#x27;t there on the server.
 Try and log into the site on the server using Internet Explorer.
 Fight with the bad looking website for the downloads page and all the pop-ups that IE gives you on first use.
 Forget your password and credentials and give up on using the browser on the server.
 Launch your local browser on your own computer
 Was the username my email address before our merger? Or was this my bosses email since he bought the license? Try all three saved passwords in LastPass for the site, all of them are incorrect.
 Password reset request
 Refresh 11 times for the password request email. Nothing.
 Junk mail? Nope.
 Do we have that Mail Quarantine app held mail thing? Not since the merger. Nothing? Ok, can&#x27;t be there.
 Execute password reset request again.
 Head back to mail and see both password reset requests.
 Enter username and password.
 FOR SECURITY, PLEASE ENTER A NEW PASSWORD
 Update the password. LastPass prompts you to update your password, choose one of the three to update.
 THANK YOU, PLEASE LOG IN
 Try the first entry from LastPass, doesn&#x27;t work. Second? Nope. Third.
 SUCCESS
 Download the software, 112MB
 How do you get the software from your machine to the old server? Software is too large. Sharefile...
 Repeat steps 7-18 for Sharefile...
 Head to server and battle more IE pop-ups just to enter the URL to download the software
 Software is downloaded! Software name: Software(1).exe
 Check the downloads folder of the server and see that Software.exe was there the whole time.
 Repeat every day. Every single day you are in IT, sometimes twice.
  
It&#x27;s not like this for everything we do, but sometimes it be like this.

 I moved into this job from another team. I was a high performer in my previous team but my growth in that team was stalled. My manager in that team was a good people manager.

But I am not a mover, a decorator, a physical labor force. I don&#x27;t ask accounting to take out the trash in my office after hours. That is not their job and it is not mine to interact with non-IT related objects.
 Big pieces of wood/metal nailed or screwed together does not constitute IT equipment.

 If I try and enable shadow copies on one it works on another it fails with a 0x80042306.
 Found some articles that point to competing backup software but none is installed and the fact one drive works and another doesn&#x27;t makes me wonder about the drive.
 The drive permissions are the defaults on the one that works and on the one that doesn&#x27;t the drive is set at the volume/root as SYSTEM and Administrators Full Control.
 The data folders have the required users level permissions added on them.
 Could it be that?

                              <span>We are looking to migrate away from Sophos in the next two months as they are going to stop their on-prem solutions and go cloud only. 
 For our Windows-Clients, we decided to go with Defender as we already pay for MS365 Premium License where its included and its easy to manage and configure over the defender portal. 
 For our 20+ Windows-Servers, we are not really sure in which direction we should go. We are looking to update everything to Windows-Server 2022 in the next months, is the default included Defender functionality enough? Or should we go with Defender for Business? Or is Defender at all not enough for our Servers and we need to go with one of the bloated, complicated 3rd party solutions like bitdefender, trendmicro etc. pp? 
 What do you people use at your companies? I have a lot of experience in Linux-Admin stuff but not really in the microsoft world, thats why I would be happy to get some insights from the experts here.

                              <span>Good morning,
 I run IT for a small defense contractor. One the compliance controls we have to meet is some sort of authentication before users can access our network. Our users all exist in Azure AD, so my thinking was that I&#x27;d implement some sort of SSO portal users must go through when their computers join the network in order to gain full access to the internet and internal resources on the network. 
 However, all of the solutions I&#x27;ve seen seem to be designed to work with an on-prem AD, which I&#x27;d like to avoid deploying if I don&#x27;t need it. Are there any tools you all are aware of to achieve this goal? Maybe even through SAML?
 Our networking is handled through a SonicWall TZ300 and a few HP Office Connect 1920/1950s for reference.
 Any guidance is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>We have a small accounting dept of about 3 people.
 They have 2 contractors who do work for them.
 We have no on prem infrastructure, everyone uses SharePoint.
 Problem: When the contractors make Excel workbooks, they link other workbooks to it. Then when they drop it in SharePoint you open an Excel doc and all the links are broken. The only way to &quot;fix&quot; it is to go into every new Excel workbook and manually update all of the links to point to the source files they put on SharePoint. I cant expect accounting to do this all day, I wouldnt want to either.
 This is a HUGE problem. Accounting has files fractured everywhere and the consultants with all these inter workbook links are making everything a tedious mess.
 What is an appropriate solution to this? I imagine step one is getting the consultants to actually START the workbooks in the same space that we will end up accessing them from, and also keeping the sources there for links. Assuming they will actually listen to that, is SharePoint a workable tool for it? I need something that doesnt involve VPN but also isnt too complicated to learn for the end users and consultants.

 Thank you!!!!

                              <span>Hey Everyone.
 I inherited a new environment and it&#x27;s a Parent Child Domain. I need to implement RBAC which is not a big deal but there were some questions I had to anyone out there they may know the answer. The Big thing that none of the Windows SMEs or Linux SMEs here can figure out whether or not to enable the &quot;Other Domain Supports AES encryption&quot; in the trust between Parent and Child. Now we run mostly Win2012R2 and Above on the Servers and Domain Controllers and all the Linux Servers are at least RHEL7. We do keep RC4 Encryption enabled. We I started RBAC on the child in which the Exchange Server Resides, I enabled Kerberos and it broke the Exchange Server that resides in the Child (All services were running email was not flowing). So I am working on RBACing the Parent First before doing the child. I am wondering from both a Windows and Linux perspective and since we still need to use RC4, should we check this box or leave it unchecked for now still.

                              <span>Hey, 
 Long time lurker - first time poster.
 I manage the IT for an 80 person consultancy company, my work laptop - a HP Probook 435 X360 has a weird trackpad issue which HP seem to be unable to resolve, and are not accepting liability for. 
 The trackpad works fine in BIOS, and from a bootable Ubuntu USB - but not in Windows 10 or 11 - no matter which version I use, or even in the Windows set up from bootable USB. The trackpad did originally work when the laptop was new (it&#x27;s about 4/5 months old now.)
 I&#x27;ve tried uninstalling the device in device manager, running all updates, updating firmware, tried different OS&#x27;s. It seems to fail on any Windows OS. 
 Any ideas before I lose my mind?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have the following setup:
 1 reverse proxy for a SSL certificate in *.test.xxx (Win Serv 2019 Std &amp; IIS 1809 17763.3650)
 1 reverse proxy for a SSL certificate in *.prod.xxx (Win Serv 2016 Std &amp; IIS 1607 14393.5501)
 Both of them redirect to the same IIS Server who hosts the apps.
 Until yesterday, everything was fine (obviouslty), both Chrome and Firefox were good to navigate sites on either domain (test or prod).
 Company made an update of Firefox, we now use FF 102.5 esr aaaand... I have a 401 on every site in the prod domain with Firefox. Chrome is fine...
 ​
 Response headers for FF on xxx.prod.xxx (not working)
 https://i.imgur.com/X2MkxXG.png
 Response headers for FF on xxx.test.xxx (working fine)
 https://i.imgur.com/lRuhSzq.png
 And Response headers for Chrome on xxx.prod.xxx (working)
 https://i.imgur.com/sOPO5r3.png
 ​
 I obviously suspect a change on Firefox parameters somewhere, but have no clue as where to look.
 Any lead will be appreciated 😊
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi folks,
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to find a method to stop people in my organisation from &quot;requesting&quot; read receipts. I can find all sorts of information about disabling responses to them, but that&#x27;s not helpful for what i&#x27;m trying to acheive.
 I want to blanket GPO to stop people in my organisation from having the option to request read receipts in the first place - we already have policy to not send responses to read receipts.
 TIA

                              <span>Yes - pants. What are your favorite pair of pants that seem to hold up well to our work? We have to wear dress pants to work and the only brand I&#x27;ve found that holds up ok is Khul and they are $90 a pair. Other cheaper brands wear out so fast.

                              <span>Databases are something I know enough about to break it. I need to automate a process, and there are DB entries that need to be deleted. The vendor that owns the Software has no intention of creating any kind of process for the problem I am trying to solve. My guess is they want people to go to the cloud version. I have a few years before we do that. 
 Have you been in this scenario?

 P.S we cannot use email for MFA.

                              <span>Hey all, bit of a weird question about opinions on physically cleaning equipment. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all been there where users return laptops and they are in a disgusting state, or even equipment we have such as switches, routers, APs, servers that have been sat in a dusty store room neglected for months if not years.
 What do you use to clean your equipment and screens?
 Personally for my own home and desk set-up in the office I have a plush microfiber with screen cleaner. A small brush for my keyboard and mousepad.
 For laptops, we are lucky enough to work in a lab so we have access to a ton of Isopropyl alcohol. I use some Costco microfibers and Isopropyl to wipe down almost all laptops, keyboards, mice, servers and switches.
 But I&#x27;m interested in hearing what you all use?

                              <span>We&#x27;re just looking at doing the upgrade from 1.6.x to the latest version (2.1.20) via a swing migration on a new server. 
 I used the https://www.alitajran.com/migrate-azure-ad-connect/ instructions and the new server with new Azure AD Connect is in staging mode. The syncs all showed sucesssful in the syncronization service manager.
 I went through the Verify steps here to check what changes would be exported https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-staging-server#verify-the-configuration-of-a-server. Within the export.csv file that I generated using csexportanalyzer it looks like it would update the msExchRemoteRecipientType value to 0x4,0x64 (depending on if its user or shared) as it is set on AD to all of our remote mailboxes objects and also msExchMailboxAuditEnable and msExchMailboxAuditLogAgeLimit on a few of the mailboxes. Just wondering why there are that many changes required, is this anything to worry about? Obviously id like to make sure all is well before I think about going live, cheers

                              <span>Dear sysadmins, hopefully you can give me advice on the following.
 Since a couple of months I teach informatics to 15-18 year olds. Currently they use desktops that are heavily regulated by a centralized IT team. Meaning, you can barely do anything on them except open up Word and a browser.
 Fine for everybody else in the school, but not when trying to teach informatics. To give you an idea, if you try to create a .js file you get an automated official warning for trying to install a harmful executable. Installing anything through the IT team is tedious, extremely slow (I waited 2 months for a code editor) and often fruitless (they weren&#x27;t going to remove the .js restriction anytime soon).
 I convinced the right people to give me budget to purchase laptops to use how I see fit, fully outs…</span>

 I&#x27;m looking for one that integrates with Intune, so i can pull out our existing devices and automatically assign them to our users, and most importantly pull warranty information for me, so I don&#x27;t have to look up every serial number manually. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve already tried several, including SnipeIT, EzOfficeInventory and BlueTally. The closest I got was with BlueTally, except they only pull warranty information for Dell and Lenovo PC&#x27;s.
 ​
 Is there anything out there that does these two things?

                              <span>Hi admins.
 I&#x27;m setting up a new solution that will help automate various processes in my company, one of the processes is the permission assignment, the permissions will be affected depending on an element that the user chooses, as is known, users do not usually remember what permissions they may be given when selecting a certain profile.
 I was looking for a solution to document all the permissions that are granted with each profile, the idea is to make it easy for the tech team to manage and for the users who need to see the information to see. 
 That the solution has integration or easy implementation within Microsoft 365 is a plus. 
 Some idea?
 Thanks a lot.

                              <span>I am looking to expand the RAM of several Dell R6525 servers, and was looking at OEM prices and they seem a bit expensive around 645€ per 16GB:
 https://imgur.com/a/51gpns5
 Looking for the exact Part Number (18ASF2G72PDZ-3G2R1) provides several results for about 78$ Examples: 
 https://www.amazon.com/Micron-MTA18ASF2G72PDZ-3G2R1-DDR4-3200-Server-Memory/dp/B092TGCFPZ
 https://www.serversupply.com/MEMORY/PC4-25600/16GB/MICRON/MTA18ASF2G72PDZ-3G2R1_348565.htm
 I expected to pay a bit more for OEM parts, but almost 10x the price seems a bit too much.
 What I am missing? Is this just a robbery by Dell? Do you have any experience using non OEM memory in Dell servers?

                              <span>I have HP Proliant N54L microserver Gen7. The data disks are united into RAID1 with the help of embedded service, which is often called fakeraid. One of disks failed and I am going to replace it. Please, help me to understand how to do it properly. I.e., I am shutting down the server, taking out failed disk from the bay, inserting the new one, turning on the server back. Which are the next steps? Will it automatically rebuild the disk array? Or what? Thanks in advance!

 How does it work if I add in a sire such as HR that not everyone should have synced? Will it only sync sites they have permissions for?
 Is it best practise to have multiple config profiles with the different share permissions. I.e. one for all shares that everyone should access, then one for HR, one for accounts?

                              <span>Hi fellow sysadmins,
 i wanted to check with you guys if any of you have experienced this issue on your Win 10 machines. For us it started about two weeks ago, and I cannot, for the life of me find the cause.
 Basicly what happens is that Outlook/Teams will not sign in, and the Start menu button is not responding.
 We have about 500 Win10 clients, and so far it has been about 30 machines that have come to us with this problem with random intervals. The eventlog is jam packed with errors, the same as you see in the link below. We have a fix in place that works well, and the user is up and running again, but I am struggling to find the culprit/cause of this. I worry that this will continue with more and more computers coming in to us with the same issue.
 I&#x60;ve eliminated windows update as a cause, our antivirus, and we do not have ClickShare installed.

 Any ideas or experiences with this issue?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins.
 We have a certain user in our organization, which of reasons I am not really able to discuss, is in need of a very strict computer policy, mainly in regard to web browsing.
 The user itself has asked for a surveillance solution where they know that every X second a screendump is taken and saved to a location the user itself cannot access, but that the user knows a supervisor both has access too, and frequently browse through. This will effectively prevent the user from doing wrong things on the internet as they know they will be “caught”. 
 In addition, we are thinking of installing a VNC-server so the supervisor at any time can connect and remote view the screen. This will pose as an additional “threat” to the user to not do anything they should not be doing.
 Any tips regarding a working web filter would also be appreciated. 
 Obviously, we will have a signed contract between the end user, the supervisor, and the company in regard to this deal. We will also make sure local authorities accept our solution as not to violate anyone’s basic rights. But like I said, most of these ideas originated from the user itself, and we believe the legal part of it won’t be an issue.
 Technically we are hoping to run this on a domain-joined desktop with Windows 11.
 In summary:
 1) Need a software/solution for taking a screenshot every X second and save to a folder inaccessible to the user itself. Other ideas are welcomed. 
 2) Software alternative to VNC in order to being able to remote view a computer at any time without end user interaction.
 3) Any working webfilter to block certain types of websites.
 4) Other tips on how to set up a secure and surveillance of a computer in order to make sure the end user knows they cannot perform any foul play even if they are tempted to, or technically able to do so.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 ​
 I&#x27;m currently evaluating several 3rd party tools (SIEMs) to help me with admin log management in a large Exchange environment.
 ​
 I have noticed something Exchange Admin Audit log management.
 ​
 If you open Windows PowerShell and load the Exchange module nothing you do in or to Exchange will be in the admin log. it seems to be a big hole.
 thanks,Big hole for Exchange Admin Audit Log

 Can something like this cause an audit fail?
 I read a thread on here that Said even the cleaning company needs to be certified …not sure if that was a joke or not

 What is in your opinion the best software to fully wipe a drive/HDD? I currently used the Seagate software but now I found out it will only accepts Seagate drive, but I have an WD drive that needs to be wiped, but can’t. 
 What software do you recommend? Preferably it has the German, Peter Gutmann’s or Bruce Schneider protocols. 
 Also I looked at the r/sysadmin wiki and the data erasure section, but it looks like that page is no longer valid, links are missing there and guides are gone. Maybe it needs to be updated again?

                              <span>Hi, fellow sysadmins!
 I work in a large manufacturing company (cca 1300 employees and cca 500 PCs). Almost all PCs do have enabled Remote Desktop Connection, which works great. We also have WOL set up, which also works great. During COVID time the need for a work-from-home option has been introduced. So we set up remote access to PC via Remote Desktop Gateway. We also put 2FA on it. Also no problems. Last month our boss told us, that we need to set a policy on all PCs that would put them to sleep (so the company can lower the power consumption and especially the bill for it) after more extended inactivity. So now the problems start.
 Most PCs wake up when you want to connect to them via RDC (either inside a company or from home), but some just do not want to wake up and the RDC window put out an error for failed connection. But the strange part is, that if we send the WOL packet to the same PC it will boot/wake up without a problem. So BIOS and NIC are configured correctly for WOL. Are there any different settings for waking up PC from sleep when there is network activity to it? Did any of you experience similar problems?
 I&#x27;m grateful for any answers or suggestions.
 Regards

                              <span>I work for a vendor with a bladed compute solution.
 We support both FC and FCoE uplinks from our best selling Network Module.
 However 99+ % of our customers use FC, so the tribal knowledge on FCoE uplinks is VERY sparse.
 Ran into a customer however who wants FCoE, and despite the fact there there are virtually no &quot;knobs to turn&quot; on our side, the upstream Cisco 93xx network guy keeps saying it must be on our side.
 Just looking for someone who perhaps has this working in their environment and would be willing to share the requisite config items needed at the switch and port level.
 And yes Cisco TAC was called.
 No they can&#x27;t solve it.
 And yes the Blade Switch team is working on it, but again very little settings there and we literally have the Blade Switch Engineering team already looped in. So it can&#x27;t get escalated any higher on our side.

 Thanks for any help,

                              <span>Sorry for the lack of understanding.
 I have a router doing the neighbor discovery and route advertisements.
 PC on the wireless gets an address using SLAAC cause there&#x27;s no DHCPv6 on the network, and it&#x27;s within the right prefix.
 But I can&#x27;t ping, can&#x27;t do dns lookups or anything. I would have thought acl but it&#x27;s allow all and SLAAC isn&#x27;t possible without permitting traffic to the client for sure. 
 Client is windows 10 Aruba WLC and AP
 I learned that SLAAC being advertised by the router makes that router the GW and there&#x27;s no way around that. But not all parameters supplied in the RAs are being adhered to like the dns server. 
 My routers and switches and the WLC can all ping one another fine using the global unicast.
 Does SLAAC require the GW be link local? It just seems maybe that is the issue but I&#x27;m not certain.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Has anyone experienced a single (or more) statements just randomly disappearing from a router? Earlier this week one of our ipsec tunnels fell on its face and when I investigated – the phase 2 configs were just missing… Completely disappeared and no one can log on to that thing outside of me. 
 Is there any way to diagnose what caused that thing to disappear? We have like 50 other tunnels up but it was just that one that went down.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m tasked with migrating over our outbound and hosting paired firewalls. I&#x27;ve already done the LLD for it. The plan is pretty much on there. But I need to put together a plan or &quot;order of operations&quot; for the order and times it&#x27;ll take for each job involved in the process. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;ll take all in all, about 4 months to do it properly.
 In your experiences doing this in the past (my first time, hence the question), how do you go about putting one of these plans together? I&#x27;m going to give myself buffer times in each job involved to so I can cover mine and the other engineers asses to. But how do you go about putting it together, do you do them on word and elaborate on each step with a time associated to it, or excel for it or something else?
 If its a bit of an odd question then apologies, but it&#x27;s my first time doing something big like this and I thought it made sense to put it out there and ask

                              <span>So this is an odd one, but bare with me. So i recently attempted to migrate a clients core switches from 2 Nexus 3ks in a VPC configuration over to 2 Arista 7020sr’s in a VRRP / MLAG configuration. 
 After swinging cables, everything was working except for ONE virtual machine server (which was of course mission critical). This server lives on their one and only ESX vSphere host, on VLAN 100. Mind you, there’s about 15 other servers on this VLAN 100 network that were working just fine.
 VLAN 100 lives on the core switches, with the VIP being 10.64.100.1/23 shared between both switches, and .2 and .3 physical IPs living on switch 1 and switch 2 respectively. So .100.1 is the default gateway for all the virtual servers. 
 Their ESX host connects to the switches via a port channel that participates in MLAG, and carry’s all vlans across it. 
 Now the issue we were seeing on this single server (which was address .100.147) was that it was not installing arp entries correctly. It was unable to ping its default gateway (.100.1) and ONLY had an arp entry for .100.3, which is the physical IP for VLAN 100 on switch 2. All other servers were correctly installing the arp entry for the VIP .100.1 as expected, but this single server was the only one not properly handling ARP entries. 
 Any ideas on this one? I’m quite new to using VRRP / MLAG so i wasn’t sure of any possible limitations, or what i should be looking for in vCenter or on the VM settings. 
 Any help would be appreciated! Sorry for the “all over the place” explanation, im hella tired after the cutover attempt.

                              <span>Hi, just finished a Technical Interview and they ask some questions about of OSPF and EIGRP and I just went blank, I didn&#x27;t remember much about those protocols, I mean the fundamentals stuff yes but the states, LSA packets not so much, also I did respond correctly why a router would be stuck on active and why it wouldn&#x27;t form an OSPF adjacency. I have been working for an ISP and we mainly used BGP for everything so it&#x27;s been a while since I used either of those protocols. I nailed every BGP question btw.
 They also ask me about switching, firewalls and how to tshoot high latency problems. In all of those questions I think I did great so idk. Would you hire someone who doesn&#x27;t remember OSPF and EIGRP packets?

 This is what my Bonjour Gateway looks like:

Who wants to spend hours trudging through the same bullshit over and over again? OFC people are gonna figure out how to automate stuff, which includes logging into network devices and running commands. Never understood this whole devops craze.
 Everyone these days acting like devops is some renaissance/new age enlightenment of automation. Guess tools like Ansible has made it easily accessible to the masses, but I never understood why old school shell scripts was any more difficult.
 Now this craze has spread to the neteng community. People who work at the largest scales absolutely need these skills to even survive and work efficiently. It&#x27;s nothing really new. I just don&#x27;t understand the hype....people have been doing this shit for ages.
 Now they are calling people &quot;SREs&quot; which in my mind are just your run of the mill sysadmins. Guess you gotta put those buzzwords to get noticed by recruiters these days, in which case I honestly do have 10+ experience doing &quot;net devops&quot;

This seems like a really simple solution, almost too simple, what are the downside to using a 10Gb simplex SFPs? The existing fiber is all single mode and the runs are less than 1Km.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never used an open source NOS. I want to know whether I can use it for all purpose. Can I just buy a bare-metal box from fs , install a free ONL or SONiC and use it in the test environments or in an enterprise? And what do you need to know about scaling with these OSes? Where can I start off learning about ONL, openswitch or SONiC? I can&#x27;t afford cumulus and other paid NOS. I just want to learn more about them because it seems Open NOS are becoming a trend in switching as of lately.

                              <span>Hello, 
 Which one would be more beneficial to my career of the above. Currently I am working for a known vendor&#x27;s firewall TAC. The end career goal is nice contractor role; I&#x27;ve seen that network engineer contractor roles are more predominant in DC than Corporate environments. 
  
MSP providing private cloud, colocation. Scope: Mostly support/change requests with some chance of minor project work. Ticket example: VPN TSH, creation, FW rule creation, generic network support tickets. Tech stack: Fortinet, Cisco SW, Forti SW, VMWare
 Some few Cisco Asa, other vendors scattered 
 NO SDN/SD-WAN/NSX hands-on.
 Automation is out of scope for role.
 
Note: Support is ONLY for private cloud related network and firewall deployed by MSP in customer&#x27;s enviorement.
 
Major ISP providing private cloud, colocation. Scope: General maintenance, new customer instance ( can&#x27;t recall word ) creation, project works in ongoing migrations Tech stack: Cisco ACI, Cisco shop with Nexus, Blades etc.
 
Automation is in project and they allow room for / support involvement in the automation and other projects.
 
 Your opinion is appreciated.

                              <span>This might be a dumb question here, but I just want a sanity check on my situation, doesn&#x27;t seem normal but I could be wrong.
 What percentage of your job would you say is documentation vs hands on?
 I ask because I recently got out of the military and have been in government contracting for a bit as a network engineer, and I get it&#x27;s slow, but my boss is adamant that two years of working on documents is peak engineering and what engineering is all about.
 Now I&#x27;m all about some documentation, but two years? For one for one device replacements? We&#x27;re still fighting for a correct list of every device procured for this effort so we can make sure clients are getting what they&#x27;re expecting, it&#x27;s a shit show lol. I figured I&#x27;d be more involved in the gear, but it is government contracting...
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with mapping out our infrastructure across both the on-prem datacentres (which I already have tools for) and also our AWS/Azure networks. Is there anything you&#x27;d recommend that is capable of doing both or am I looking at using multiple tools and bolting the outputs together in Visio or similar?
 Note: I&#x27;m not looking for anything to perform monitoring, just collect the information and ideally be able to run on a schedule so I&#x27;m not having to manually chase changes made by other teams.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Does anyone have any recommendations on software which can help us track what is patched where? I have been told by colleagues that this sort of software doesn&#x27;t exist.
 At the moment we are using Excel but this has severe limitations, as you can imagine. We want a single source of truth which can be updated etc.
 I am wondering how others are tracking this information.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello all, In the near future I will get the task to renew the network hardware in the data center. So far we have two N5k with four N2k each as fabric extender in use. The two N5k are configured as vPc peers. Virtual machines and servers are connected with vpc to two different fabric extenders each, in order to create a failsafe and to be able to perform ISSU updates without interruption.
 We plan to replace the N5k with slightly &quot;larger&quot; Nexus 9300 and the N2K with slightly &quot;smaller&quot; Nexus 9300 as fabric extenders. this means to rebuilding the old design.
 I realize that the future of data center best practices is in a different. (ACI or VXLAN) However, I think the traditional design meets our needs and requirements.
 Now my question is, do you disagree with here to replace the N5k with n9k and also the N2k with n9k as fabric extender? Are there perhaps more elegant options?
 Thanks a lot

All servers are in 1G and 8 SFP+ ports are unused. Original connection was wired with Cat 5 and unmanaged switches but we are buying new POE switches (7-8 in numbers) and my question is:
 Can we buy 10G uplink access switch and connect SFP+ from access to SFP+ of core C9300??(Star configuration)
 OR 
 How to connect all acess swithces to core any suggestions??

                              <span>Preface: Yeah, I know. &quot;Don&#x27;t span L2&quot;. This is one potential option for a migration from a legacy network in an industrial environment, not a traditional enterprise environment. There are options to migrate to a routed design but it would be significantly more work so I&#x27;m considering this option as well. 
 For the topology, imagine 50 routers with wifi and ethernet interfaces (bridged), connected in client mode to a backhaul wifi mesh. The same subnet should be available on ethernet behind all of them. Minimal performance requirements means it doesn&#x27;t matter if they all terminate at a single hub and have to route through the hub every time to reach each other.
 My first thought was EVPN/VXLAN over IPSEC tunnels in a hub and spoke setup, however I don&#x27;t think the Cisco IR1821 (which is otherwise perfect for this design) supports EVPN. I may try to find the minimum device that supports it and see if it fits the budget because its fairly standard at this point.
 Next was L2TPv3 but it appears to be point to point only, i.e., the hub could only have a L2 pseudowire terminate with one other device.
 Just bridging ethernet onto the mesh and encrypting the mesh isn&#x27;t an option unfortunately.
 Are there any options I&#x27;m missing? 
 To avoid an XY problem: the only requirements are that layer 2 traverses the backhaul network, encrypted/terminated by well-known-ish-vendor devices we control (not the mesh itself). Bonus points if the terminating devices include the wifi radio because it removes a point of failure.

 Anyone uses Lenovo ThinkPads in WS1 (WorkspaceONE) with BIOS Password and Configuration? All what I know is that its not official Supported by WS1 just for DELLS.
 Do Anyone lnows how to set BIOS Configurations on new and already enrolöed devices?
 We run Windows 10 and 11 on the ThinkPads.
 Thanks for the help!

 It all began when I brought up a 3rd domain controller, to go into a branch office site. All was well until I tried to add the rDNS zone for the branch office subnet and got a server error. After a lot of swearing and thrashing, it all seems to come down to this DCDIAG error:
  
Starting test: VerifyReplicas
 This NC (DC&#x3D;DomainDnsZones,DC&#x3D;xxxxxx,DC&#x3D;xxxx) is supposed to be replicated to this server, but has not been replicated yet. This could be because the replica set changes haven&#x27;t replicated here yet. If this problem persists, check replication of the Configuration Partition to this server.

Obviously the script can’t be run anywhere the certificate isn’t installed in the local store. But I did want to read about best-practice regarding this sort of configuration. Anyone have some good advise or an article describing best-practice here?
 Also, running into an issue, existing scripts are built extensively surrounding “get-credential”. Trying to determine the best method to re-write using the new auth method. I need to store the certificate and pass it for each tenant for connect-azuread. Storing get-credential was easy for each tenant. For cert auth, I’m still scratching my head.

 When completing the &quot;Verify Credentials&quot; phase, the source Exchange complains &quot;Your migration failed while checking source credentials. The request failed. The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.&quot;
 Permissions are good, as I can access the accounts to be migrated from OWA while using the administrator account used in the Migraitonwiz project.

 ​
 it is my understanding, and I have been told that if you have a domain controller, it has to do DNS and possibly DHCP. 
 Is this correct? 
 I find that the problem with this is that if the server goes down, it obviously takes Internet along with it, so it is a double whammy outage for the business. 
 What are best practices? To have DNS and DHCP both on the domain controller, or to configure it on the firewall and have backup / fail-over / secondary DNS, DHCP configured on the domain control?
 What do you guys do and prefer?
 My clients are generally 10-100 employee businesses, have a couple between 100-300.
 I don&#x27;t want to over-complicate things, but I also want to maximize reliability &amp; redundancy, within reason.
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m a junior sysadmin based in the USA. I&#x27;m sure you guys have seen the news regarding the weather on the west coast. 
 Today we had a power outage and as of this post we are still without power. We are currently powering the crucial servers which host the domain controller vm&#x27;s etc via a gasoline generator with 240v extension cords lol. 
 Needless to say the power outage sparked a big conversation, at work, about the cost of maintaining on prem AD environment. For instance we had to call an electrician to fix an issue with our generator, how often do we need to be testing out the equipment in the case of another power outage, etc.
 We have a hybrid AD env but the most crucial files are hosted on prem. I floated the idea of moving certain files shares to azure so people can work (process invoices) in the event of another outage, among other things.
 As I started looking into replacing AD with Azure AD I came across the this article (mentioned in the title of this post).
 To the more senior sysadmins out there what are your thoughts the article and more importantly it&#x27;s general sentiment; e.g. Azure AD is not a replacement for on prem AD but rather an enhancement?
 Thanks

                              <span>The title pretty much says it all. We&#x27;ve recently (18 months ago) moved over to OKTA for their CE/SSO/MFA/OAG services. During a true up/consumption review, they operated in pretty poor faith and bent us over for several hundred thousands per year extra.
 The issue stems from the original scope expanding and OKTA professional services being engaged to do the architecture. This effectively resulted in additional orgs being created that weren&#x27;t necessary and we had users cross federating between them which created duplication or triplication of users and jacked our consumption up. At no point were we informes we should account for consumption or take additional user life cycling measures.
 As a result we&#x27;ve got 4 months to fix it or piss them into the wind and go to another offering. We came from Azure MFA and SSO, has anyone ever gone back? Has anyone else had any bad experiences with OKTA that left a bad taste?

                              <span>LOL I installed XP today. 
 I had a bend press out on the production floor give us the old ‘no hard disk found’. Took the computer out of the machine completely dismantled it to get to the hard drive (it’s basically an all-in-one attached to the machine with a swiveling arm and the back of the case is a inch thick aluminum plate which is the heat sink for the pc). Put a new IDE SSD in it, restored the ghost image, and put it back together. 
 ‘no hard disk found’
 Grrr. Started to suspect that something more than just the drive was crapped out. 
 Got the forces in motion to request lead time and cost for a new (!) computer, which would still have hardware capable of - and running - Win XP (the servos in the machine require specific software which only runs on XP)
 6-8 weeks. $60k
 ‘Wut’
 Took the computer back off and pulled it apart again. Retraced my steps to see if I missed something. I didn’t. 
 Put it back together. 
 Back in the machine, I booted the computer again. 
 ‘Invalid partition table’. 
 Interesting… it sees a hard drive. 
 Took it back apart. 
 Hard drive back into the ancient laptop we keep around just for this kind of stuff. 
 Had to get creative.
 I suspected the MBR to be missing/corrupt. The replacement SSD had smaller capacity than the original spinner. I had to tell our ghosting software to resize the partition, which I think messed it up. 
 So I wiped the drive, looked and found a XP Professional dvd, and installed a fresh copy. Once done, I booted the ancient laptop back to the ghosting software, and wiped the partition I just created with Win XP install. 
 I then ghosted our backup image back. 
 30 mins later, I had the computer back in the machine and it was time to go for a test run. 
 Booted right up, they’re happily running production as we speak.

                              <span>I made a post a while back explaining Management posted an ad for a job position of someone that should work under me, but they didn&#x27;t consult me before posting out said ad which is very inaccurate.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/z8w6rm/my_input_wasnt_asked_before_posting_an_ad_to_hire/
 I followed someone&#x27;s advice here and kept my mouth shut.
 Today a colleague (husband of the lady in Management) approached me to tell me they have started hiring and will need my input. He told me he saw the ad and was surprised cause it doesn&#x27;t reflect the post (we work closely together on some IT stuff). 
 So for those saying &quot;you&#x27;re getting replaced and in denial&quot; 
 No I&#x27;m not. Hell I might even get a raise soon by the look of things, and got a bonus despite being there for 6 months.

                              <span>I work from home and while my job has its fair share of projects that need to be done I continually find myself with down time. 
 Don’t get me wrong I love having my own time to do my thing but I feel my family could really benefit from doubling my income.
 We live paycheck to paycheck and don’t spend outside our means at all. I’d really like to build up a savings account and be able to afford one of things without really stressing. 
 So I was wondering if any of you have thought about taking up a second job as well. What would you do? A second sysadmin or something like help desk?

                              <span>Ironically, we had a &quot;disaster&quot; event less than 2 years ago. You would think people would remember that bad things do happen, DR sites aren&#x27;t just a box you check off. I imagine some c-level is going to get a bonus for cost cutting by not having to buy hardware to accommodate new clients. And some middle level manager is going to get the axe when we need the disaster recover site and it turns out we don&#x27;t have enough capacity.

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin, I&#x27;m /u/AutoModerator, and welcome to this month&#x27;s Patch Megathread!
 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>This is a rant but also a question.
 I work for a small size company in America. My boss is American and has been quite harsh on me lately.
 A few years ago, he decided to outsource some of the company operations to the Middle East. That didn&#x27;t work too well but still kept some guys there.
 Part of my job is to provide these guys in the ME with training and advice, which I do in almost a daily basis. What is happening is that they don&#x27;t seem to comprehend any training I give them. I have been giving them countless of trainings and spent a lot of hours that ended in nothing. 
 They get the idea but when it comes to real work, they cannot connect the dots. I&#x27;m not an English native speaker so I&#x27;m not quite sure how to word this without sounding too harsh.
 I recognize I&#x27;m not the best instructor and possibly being English not my first language has something to do with it but still, I&#x27;m puzzled. Not sure what to do. Is it cultural? Maybe they are not thinking logically? I don&#x27;t know.
 Example: I teach them how to solve an issue (e.g restoring a backup). They say &quot;Ok, understood&quot;. When the same situation presents again, but varies slightly, they screw it up and cannot solve it thus making my boss really angry AT ME. 
 If something changes, even slightly, they get mega confused and cannot solve it.
 Have this ever happened to you? If yes: How did you explain it? 
 This is probably more a linguistic question than a sysadmin one but still I wanted to try here. 
 I&#x27;m so tired of being reprimanded for other&#x27;s people mistakes.
 Thanks for reading 😥

                              <span>Those of you that have security awareness training for your employees, how do you handle people that refuse to watch the videos? I&#x27;ve tried rewarding with raffles for people that complete all issued video as well as scare tactics. But I still have a significant portion of people (including managers) that refuse to watch a slightly entertaining video for 5 minutes.

                              <span>My organization has a lot of people and it&#x27;s not uncommon for people to change departments within the organization. For the most part everyone has just maintained their old emails, but the question got brought up of the industry standard. I tried phrasing this question a ton of different ways to google yet I didn&#x27;t get back anything nothing useful. Do we create them a new email account? Do we archive all their old emails and wipe their current account so it&#x27;s clean for their new role? Do we just continue as we are and let them keep everything? Some of our employees have access to confidential information that they won&#x27;t need after they leave their role for another. This got brought up because we are currently going through a massive network/system restructure and standardization process.

                              <span>Something finally snapped last night and I completely broke down. Spent over an hour just sobbing in my girlfriend&#x27;s arms about how much I hated my job. The work sucks, the pay sucks, and the lack of replies on my applications isn&#x27;t helping. The cherry on top was being woken up an hour and a half before my shift today to a phone call from an angry user.
 My company has a listing for a blue collar field job right now. The wage is 35% higher than what I make and only requires an Associate&#x27;s Degree. I have a BSIT to clarify that last sentence.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m off to make a cup of coffee. Cheers everyone!

                              <span>Hello ! 
 In my infrastructure, I have some ESX dispatched on two sites. 
 My problem of the month is to run GPUs in my ESX, for sharing on several VMs. 
 DC1: 2x HP DL380 G9 Bi-xeon / 382 GB RAM / Quadro M2000 
 Both are in a vSphere cluster, so I can manage them that way, or from the esxi 6.7u3 interface on each of them. 
 These GPUs are compatible with these machines from HP, and are well recognized under vSphere. 
 I would therefore like to be able to allocate for example 50% of the perfs and 1 GB of GPU vRAM on each of my 4 VMs (WS2019 RDS servers). 
 How can I proceed? I go around in circles, and Nvdia wants to sell me its A16 at the price of a car to make it &quot;compatible&quot;. 
 Thank you in advance and good day !

                              <span>Over the last year or so, we have been plauged with dock issues on our Lenovo fleet. A large majority of docks we have been getting seem to have an issue at one point or another, whether it be right out of the box or a few weeks/months down the line. No amount of updating firmware or drivers seems to help. We finally gave in and started looking at alternatives.
 Behold! The Dell WD22TB4 docking station, MFG PART # DELL-WD22TB4
 Oddly enough, we have had zero issues running these with our Lenovo laptops. One monitor, two monitors, three monitors? It doesn&#x27;t care. We&#x27;ve deployed a few dozen of these and so far no complaints. Your mileage may differ, but figured I&#x27;d share my experience so far.

                              <span>A health issue compelled me to leave my IT career and now that I am well I can&#x27;t seem to catch a break. I&#x27;m getting nothing but boiler-plate refusals after nearly 20 years of experience in the field. I&#x27;ve done much too -- PT&amp;O, capacity management, application support, database management and optimization, and even data center design, power management, and installation work -- most of this was at 3-nines and I&#x27;ve even worked on systems that required 5.
 What is missing? What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>I am wondering the most efficient way that everybody applies power settings in their Windows environment.
 Currently the part of our task sequence that sets it is broken, and it will fall right asleep without it. We do set block sleep in the bios settings, which doesn&#x27;t seem to fully work without my post build script. The script is manually run and takes extra time. I am looking at fixing it in an automated fashion but wonder how others do it.
 What do you guys find to be the most efficient or easy to control?
 Is it in your task sequence? Can you add these setting via policy? Open to any and all advice. Thank you.

                              <span>Hey all,
 We have a process where a vendor will be sending us content that needs to be dealt with by our end users. The content is delivered via SFTP to a Windows Server 2022 box in our Azure environment. I have the ability to move the files around our network to various locations and I even have the ability to move the files into an Azure Blob storage bucket but I don&#x27;t really see a great way to get these files into my end users&#x27; hands to deal with them. Ideally the destination is something they are familiar with, like a SharePoint document library. 
 I did find some PoSh mechanisms to move the files into SharePoint but as I got down the rabbit hole, it seemed overly complex for what I needed so I was wondering if there was some mechanism I am overlooking before I full send and start working on PoSh.

 This user can no longer log in to their exchange mailbox - however, if I check their licenses ANY other way, it says they have everything they are supposed to (business basic). But, from this log, I believe this is saying their licenses were unassigned by azure AD.
 just confused and looking for advice / help! thanks!

                              <span>I have a boardroom that&#x27;s approximately 20&#x27;x20&#x27;, and I need to find a conference camera and mic that will work with minimal exposed wiring. Some that I&#x27;ve already looked at are
 BMA 360 | Beamforming Microphone Array Ceiling Tile | ClearOne 
 Amazon.com : Lifesize Icon 300 - Phone HD : Office Products 
 But I need some more options to compare and price. Something that&#x27;s user friendly, minimal cabling. I like that the BMA 360 is above the ceiling, but the cost may be difficult to get approved. Any suggestions? 
 This is my least favorite part of my job... I&#x27;m not a sound guy, having been nearly deaf since birth.

                              <span>Anyone ever seen this? No user including Admin users can create app passwords. MFA is enforced (and set up for each user). 
 &quot;Allow users to create app passwords to sign in to non-browser apps&quot; in Service settings in on.
 Not sure what else to check? only need one user to be able to do it for an internal system that emails reports out.

                              <span>Hi all 
 weirdest thing: I got two Draytek Vigor2820 routers. 
 I can&#x27;t find them on the network, even if i connect directly to them via a network cable I cannot get onto the portal page. 
 ACT, USB and CSM Leds are solid, sometimes the remaining LEDs come on (all at once, apart from DSL). 
 I tired multiple times to use the Factory Reset hole but it does not do anything. No reset, no flashing ACT light. 
 Exact same thing with the second 2820 router that I found in the office as a backup. 
 Anyone experienced this before or has any other idea? I ordered a new DrayTek which will arrive tomorrow to test. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Been working as the lone support guy in the office for the last 9 months, and things have been going pretty well. I look after 2 offices by myself and make sure everything and everyone is happy. 
 Got a new guy that joined this week, he literally knows nothing about IT and I am expected to train him. I don&#x27;t mind training him, even though it will take a long time before he will be able to work independently on his own, but I feel like I need to be asking for more money to compensate in my responsibilities shifting, as nowhere in my original contract does it say that those are my duties. 
 How should I bring this up to my CIO when I see him this week?

 ​
 Today, for you, I have a question.
 ​
 I have a Poco X6 - 
 https://www.91mobiles.com/poco-x6-pro-price-in-india#:~:text&#x3D;POCO%20X6%20Pro%20price%20in%20India%20is%20expected%20to%20be,available%20in%20Black%2C%20Gold%20colour.
 ​
 I would like to wipe is of android and put a light version of Linux on it and run install/configure adguard.. Then I would like to connect it to my router via a USB-C to Ethernet. Would this work if I then point my computers/TV&#x27;s to it?

 a bit on context here for the size of our SharePoint site. 
 Syncing 2 sites around is 30 people and only syncing 1 site is around 70 people. 
 Site 1 is 380GB&#x27;s in size and has around 100,000 files stored on it. (30 people or so syncing is one)
 Site 2 is 710GB&#x27;s in size and has 420,000 (nice) files stored on it. (Main file store for the business)
 Not every doc is synced most folders have permissions on them so others can&#x27;t access or see them so realistically it should not be syncing them or …</span>

 What software (for windows) would you recommend? 
  
+- 1TB of files
 documents and photos
  
A simple gui to sync (ignoring deletes with some versioning) maybe could be enough.
 As most of my relatives are cheap, anything that offers a 1 time purchase (like a NAS or external drive) is preferable over subscriptions.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I have my own desktop pc and leptop from my work. I have 2 monitors also.
 Normally i run my desktop, after that start RDP connection to leptop and start working. So i can use same keyboard + mouse + 2 monitors for both system.
 But i need to connect smartcard reader to leptop (host) for development. RDP doesn&#x27;t allow to use host smartcard reader, i guess it disables winscard.dll when remote session started.
 There is another way, connecting reader to desktop (client), and share smartcard readers over RDP. But it doesn&#x27;t meet my needs. I use vmware and, reader should detected from there also, but readers doesn&#x27;t even seen in device manager, so i can&#x27;t pass them to vmware.
 I don&#x27;t want to connect 2 monitors to leptop and use different keyboard mouse set. What can i do about this issue ? Reader issue has made me very sad, i was so happy for my current system.
 I tried some VNC apps, but they only control current leptops screens. Doesn&#x27;t share client&#x27;s both monitors.
 I don&#x27;t know is there any way to do it, but i hope for it..

                              <span>(crossposted from r/asknetsec) This will hopefully be a quick / easy question to answer. We&#x27;re implementing Certificate Based Authentication (CBA) to some items in O365. We created the template with the required x509 extensions in our internal CA and successfully created all the necessary user certs. The one thing I noticed though is that the SKI is identical on all of the generated certs. Shouldn&#x27;t this be a unique value on each cert? Each cert was created using a unique CSR and submitted through the CAs web portal if that matters. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello community,
 I have some servers in my office I would like to connect to through a &quot;VPN&quot;; 
 I can either:
 - install an OpenVPN, and a dyndns server to connect to a bastion
 - use services like Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel. 
 Is it more secure to go through Tailscale or Cloudflare ?
 They would be bottlenecks right ?
 The advantage is that they provide integration with an identity provider.

Struggling to find out if clearing the system or application logs would produce a similar event log message somewhere else or whether the cleared log name would appear in an 1102 event. Everything I have searched has only shown this event when the security log has been cleared. I think I&#x27;m being dumb today... Anyone got an idea?

                              <span>I have some servers for DR purposes, I want them to install all windows updates automatically and reboot when needed. 
 Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update\Configure Automatic updates I&#x27;ve set to option 4, &quot;Install during automatic maintenance True&quot;, &quot;Every Day&quot;. 
 I&#x27;ve then applied this to the OU for DR servers. If I run gpresult on a target server then I can see the GPO has been applied BUT the &quot;Install during automatic maintenance&quot; is set to &quot;False&quot;. Everything else is set as per the GPO EXCEPT this value. 
 The end results is that these servers (windows 2022) do not install updates automatically. 
 Any suggestions what I can try?

                              <span>From time to time I am really tired of using notepad or sublime to view logfiles and I start searching for something better, but the marketplace is flowded with either horrible bloatware, which then doesn&#x27;t get basic stuff right like 4K resolution and font sizes (looking at you LogViewPlus with the SEO budget) or ambitioned projects from 2009.
 What I imagine is a nice, quick (preferable portable) software with some presets for common logfiles, filters and if it is brillant tail capability. All this in Windows and I would pay good money for it. Ok, reasonable money.

                              <span>Good day, I am a student enrolled in a sysadmin class which requires us to create a made up business which requires 100 computers and 1 main server. 
 Our group decided to simulate having a net cafe business with 5 branches in different locations with 20 computers each for customers and 1 of those branches will host the main server.
 We would like to ask for suggestions what model/brands of servers would be fit for the job. Also if you have any suggestion on how to handle our business in terms of sysadmin side of things, it will be hugely appreciated. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>As I am migrating another SBS 2007 to 2022, I am transferring FSMO roles. I&#x27;m at the famous point you need to make the AD Schema snap-in visible.
 regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll 
 Yup, still the same on Server 2022. But why? It&#x27;s not difficult or anything, but I just don&#x27;t understand why Microsoft chose to do it like this. Why is it hidden? Because you can royally screw up your AD? Well, ADSI Edit would like a word with you. And why make it visible like this? I can&#x27;t think of any other sysadmin task where manually registering a DLL is the normal way to do things.
 I&#x27;d like to know the reason behind this, if anyone knows or has a good hypothesis. 
  
PS. I&#x27;m aware I can just do
 Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -OperationMasterRole SchemaMaster 
 for moving the role, but not to make the snap-in visible.

                              <span>Hi so basically got a blue screen on my PC, working perfectly except I got a blue screen two months ago over corrupt gpu driver, using DDU and reinstalling the driver fixed that issue. But I think I might have been wrong about that as I remember having this usb extension/converter connected to usb c port on my pc and I was using that with my astro a50’s. Today I decided I needed to charge my xbox headset, so used the usb c extender and connected it to a usb of a micro usb and plugged it into my steel series, within 10minutes of pc running it got a blue screen. When restarted my astro headset wasn’t being detected, I had to re-plug it to fix it. Is it possible the usb c converter/extender caused the blue screen?

                              <span>Hello,
 We&#x27;re in the process of upgrading our backup room. We are decommissioning two ancient P2000 G3&#x27;s and replacing them with two MSA 2052&#x27;s. We&#x27;re running Veeam as backup so copying the backup files is relatively straight forward.
 My only issue is the amount of stuff to copy- it&#x27;s well over 40TB of data across two of the old SANs. That&#x27;s about 110h+ of copy time over the 1Gbps iSCSI link available to me at the moment. The links are still in use for backups and communication so maxing out the link would be a best case scenario.
 I know the old and new units have got a SAS port but can that be used for copying data or is just for disk expansions? If there is no other way then I&#x27;ll just have to schedule a few days of downtime.
 tl;dr- Need to copy 40TB from P2000 G3 to MSA 2052 fast. 
 Thanks

 The issue is that every time a user wants to use a different terminal (which sadly, happens some what often), their profile needs to be setup manually as credentials are different to AAD.
 Has anyone got a way of securely storing these credentials so they can roam between machines? I did look at Enterprise State Roaming but doesn&#x27;t look to take items from the Credential Manager.

                              <span>For months I have had an issue where all my e-mails sent to other Microsoft tenants gets either quarantined or junk mail sorted as phishing. Internally or to other e-mail services there is no issue. I have tried every reasonable recourse such as remaking signatures, changing my e-mail address and so on.
 Recently my dad who works in a different position in my company also started having the same issue. And a while back my brother who works at a different company had also reported similar issues.
 So today I created a test tenant with Microsoft to troubleshoot. I just did out of the box developer config with standard e-mail filtering for the receiving address - which is what any company on O365 is likely to be running.
 What I found was that as long as my display name includes my last name (a 4-letter word with one regional character) Microsoft categorically flags the e-mail as junk. This is regardless if the e-mail comes from my company&#x27;s domain or from my private domain. As long as the display name includes my last name, it is considered junk by Microsoft. My first name doesn&#x27;t have any impact.
 If I change the name by replacing or adding a letter, it is no problem, so it is specifically this name that is always flagged as junk.
 So apparently people who have my last name are by default not allowed to send e-mails to companies that use O365 for e-mail. This should affect a few hundred people at least. I already have a support case open and am planning to talk to my contact at Microsoft, but neither of those options have been very useful in the past. Is there more I can do to restore my family&#x27;s honor with Microsoft?
 And also, who tf uses display name to filter spam? That seem insane.
 I have had users in my company report similar issues in the past but it passed after they changed signatures and such, but for me and my father it seemed like our last name in the display name was the only thing that impacted spam filtering.

 Back in my help-desk days I received a call from a Director. Their laptop wasn’t working and they needed it fixed asap. Told them to put in a ticket. My manager put a rush on it so I went to fix it. I get there and they are hysterical that they can’t work etc. 
 “I charged it all night.” They said. Turns out they confused their display cable plugged into their monitor as something that would power their laptop. I grabbed their power cable, plugged in their laptop and the issue was resolved. They didn’t say a word, but realized their misstep. A brain fart was had, and it provided me with quite the laugh :).

                              <span>Hybrid Enviroment with Onprem and Office 365, migrating to full 365 at some point.
 We create users from onprem as a Office 365 mailbox so communiciation bewteen both can work we have found that if a users has been placed in a non sync 365 OU for more then 90 days if we try to move it back the mailbox does not show anymore and we have been told by our infra team, that is just what it is.
 they are quite short staffed so are going with the just re-create we don&#x27;t have time to look at it right now.
 Asking in general is this a real thing or is there no reason you can&#x27;t reinstate accounts past office 365 deletion?

I really, really..... really like the idea of avoiding the DNAC gui.Also, I have only use case / theory when it comes to eem. Curious if you can automate a &#x27;ssh&#x27; to the address after some conditions are met. if it&#x27;s not obvious, my intent would be to explore what i can do with regex and variables and hopefully input it in a linux/dnac/maglev command.
 Feasible?

                              <span>quick question on best practices.
 say there is a small office configured with 4 switches same model and all in the MDF, your firewall has 4 LAN ports. would you just run a trunk to each switch or is it more common to run to a single switch and chain them all together. I do not see saturating the 1gb connection at the site but I would imagine running a cable to each switch would be more redundant. I don&#x27;t want to over complicate this property and spanning tree should do its thing if someone connects the switches together somehow.

                              <span>We run 100G internally at our data centres, currently using DAC cables to connect the servers to the switches, however we are seeing very high failure rates on the DACs. We&#x27;ve replaced at least 5 in the past 3 months. Considering we only have about 30 in total, this seems high. Every server has redundant connections (2xDAC in LACP) so it doesn&#x27;t impact production, but it&#x27;s wasting a lot of time having to RMA the failed cables with Juniper, and coach Remote Hands through replacing them physically.
 The equipment has been in place for about 4 years, and the equipment is never touched except to replace failures.
 Could we be doing something wrong with the DACs? Should we consider replacing them with AOCs instead?
 Each DC is a single rack, so distance is not a concern. Cost is also of minimal concern.

                              <span>Weird question for you folks out there that like to see link lights. 
 Say I have a network switch with a fiber SFP in port 1. I plug in a fiber pair to this port with an active Ethernet interface at the endpoint. I will see a green link light. What happens if only ‘one’ of the fibers in the pair is unplugged (aka unplug a single fiber from the TX slot in the SFP). I see the link light go out. Why is this the case when there is still the other fiber in the pair plugged into the switch? 
 Might sound dumb, but I’m really trying to understand the ‘exchange’ that happens in order for the link lights to turn on. Because it looks like there is some negotiation that happens to determine what a valid Ethernet link is. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a gateway / IDS / IPS solution that offers reporting a bit like Meraki&#x27;s for wLAN, which provides per user activity logging based on url&#x27;s visited, providing an overview of &quot;productive time&quot; and &quot;recreation time&quot; that can then be shown daily / weekly / monthly. I realise this is somewhat intrusive, but I&#x27;m tring to convince management not to install employee tracking software on all user machines, so is a kind of a lesser evil.
 This is for deployment into GCP/AWS for a remote working environment where all machines are to be auto-joined to a VPN at boot, likely using tailscale, but this has not been finalized yet.. i.e. we could consider an all in one solution, if one exists.
 Any recommendations would be appreciated!

                              <span>Trying to decide if I want to go down this route or continue with networking. A little about me, 110k/yr - 10years networking experience. I want to move into a NetDevOps/Network automation role but do not want to take a paycut. 
 Is it possible to move into this kind of role and jump from 110 -&gt; 160-180 ?
 Do I need any &quot;devops/automation&quot; certifications ? I was thinking of getting the cisco devnet but decided to just learn all the important topics instead.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>We appear to be running into an existing design constraint with an IPSec implementation with Azure VPN gateway. Essentially, we have a VPN gateway in it&#x27;s own vNET, peered with this, is a hub vNET which peers with many other vNETs in a hub/spoke topology. The VPN gateway vNET and other vNETs are spoke connections connected to the hub.
 ​
 We need the ability to have inbound connections from our other spoke vNETs to be NATTed to addresses on the VPN Gateway&#x27;s vNET. 
 For example:
 User VDI vNET: 10.10.10.0/24
 ​
 VPN Gateway vNET: 10.100.0.0/24
 VPN Gateway Route: 10.100.10.0/24
 ​
 As traffic is being sent through the VPN Gateway to 10.100.10.0/24, All inbound addresses from 10.10.10.0/24 need to be mapped to an address in 10.100.0.0/24
 Conversely, Inbound connections from 10.100.10.0/24 to 10.100.0.0/24 need to be able to return to 10.10.10.0/24
 ​
 After spending a good amount of time reading documentation and creating a test environment to validate this, I&#x27;ve not been successful. Unless i&#x27;m reading something incorrectly, it appears that only the VPN Gateway vNET itself can be NATTed to a new address. 
 ​
 Is there a design constraint here with VPN Gateway or this there another design constraint that needs to be considered?
 ​
 Thanks!

Now Spectrum has given me their upgraded 2 box system which is assigning the static to my Fortigate, but when I plug in the UDM Pro to their secondary box, it is unable to pull a DHCP address. Wifi on their end is turned off, they say that their settings are correct and everything should be working. Anyone else got a setup like this that can shed some light on this? TIA for any help.

 Mostly Apple devices, but also IOT devices like pool controllers, cameras, lights, garage door openers, etc. 90% of these calls get referred to manufacturer and I just want to understand if there&#x27;s something more I can do, or if it&#x27;s just a technology limitation for our time.

 Hey guys I have been getting the issue for months now. Multiple RMAs have been done on this device, but eventually.. the FPC chassis link error alarms come back... And they are always tied to SIB 0 plane 0. All the devices with link errors tied to SIB 0 also all have Major Processing Errors on the PFEs. I&#x27;m tired of dealing with JTAC because they request the same solution to RMA which does not fix anything(SIB0 has been replaced). Could this be a software issue, and technical issue causing the Processing errors on the PFE that are creating the FPC link errors ? Please share...

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a Network Engineer for a Municipal ISP. I finally got around to requesting IPv6 space from ARIN and have been assigned a /32 prefix. I&#x27;ve been doing quite a bit of research regarding design and deployment best practices, but I have a few questions that I&#x27;d like your thoughts about.
 Thus far my Ipv6 addressing plan is to assigned /64 to all service provider infrastructure, such as customer facing interfaces and VLANs, /56 for PD, and /127 for p2p segments.
  
In accordance with RFC 6177, I&#x27;ll plan on assigning /56 prefixes to customer end sites using DHCPv6-PD. When a customer site receives a PD, how does my PE router know what interface to route the assigned PD prefix towards the customer? I&#x27;m not sure if this is vendor specific, but let&#x27;s assume I&#x27;m using Windows Server for DHCPv6 server and my PE is a Cisco Catalyst 9500.
 
When a customer wants public Ipv4 space from us we usually just allocate a /29 and statically route that prefix to the customers IP on the p2p segment. Is this methodology considered best practice for Ipv6 also? 
 
 Thanks in advance!

 Just want to get a pulse on what marketing/buzzwords are going around.
 Kinda makes me roll my eyes when I hear these buzz words cause I feel like nothing as really changed from a fundamental implementation perspective.

                              <span>Looking for an NMS solution for my company that can be run efficiently as a VM. I have used Nagios, Zabbix, and SolarWinds in the past. I currently have Zabbix running on a standalone server but would like to create a VM for ease of migration in the future when we upgrade some of our hosts and iI can add other network management-related VMs. Zabbix documentation doesn&#x27;t recommend using it as a VM. I was curious if any of you out there had any experience with open source NMSs running as a VM in your production environments. Cheers!

                              <span>Howdy y&#x27;all,
 So I work at an ISP as an edge tech/engineer or whatever you want to call it. Anyhoo, I mainly work on PON systems and the corresponding CPE that we deploy at sites. What I am struggling at the moment with that I am trying to solve is that we currently have the Calix Cloud services to onboard and monitor the Calix Routers we deploy along with some Nokia Beacons from a prior agreement that I am trying to pass down a DHCP statement to onboard them into the TR-069 server without the Calix routers having to phone home first to get their TR-069 address because that takes forever and the Nokias want to phone home to their native address that is burned into the firmware which is what I want to avoid. I&#x27;ve already created my class statement in the DHCP server config matching the OUI of all the models we deployed but when it comes to the subnet pool statement, I either have the option of only allowing members of the class to get a DHCP lease from the pool or I can issue a &quot;allow unkown-clients&quot; statement which pushed the option 43 statement to all devices in that pool. Without creating a separate pool for all other devices that aren&#x27;t Calix or Nokia, what is the right convention for like an &quot;if not a member of class&quot; then assign a regular DHCP lease without the option statement?
 shared-network LAB {
  subnet 12.3.456.789 netmask 255.255.255.128 { 
  pool{ 
  allow members of &quot;CalixONTOpt60&quot;; 
  vendor-option-space CALIXGC; 
  option CALIXGC.acs-url &quot;http://gcs.calix.com&quot;; 
  option CALIXGC.username &quot;insertusernamehere&quot;; 
  option CALIXGC.password &quot;insertpasswordhere&quot;; 
  option routers 12.3.456.789; 
  range 12.3.456.789 12.3.456.789; 
  default-lease-time 1200; 
  } 
  } 
 }

                              <span>HI all
 Recently just joined a company and IT management who arn&#x27;t technical have been sold DNA by the cisco sales monkeys. It is now a critical project (lol)
 It&#x27;s only going to be used for deployment off 1500 switches and some assurance monitoring. SDA will never ever be used.
 My question is. It appears we&#x27;re only receiving two appliances. Going off the cisco documentation I can only see reference to having 3 appliances in a cluster or a single stand alone instance. Are you able to have 2 nodes within a customer or does it need to be 3?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Can you put one passive in one office and and the active in another, hauling back the other office/all remote connections over MPLS link. If office A lost power, it would have an hour UPS battery.. but after/during which time office B firewall/dhcp to take over all connections. Offices are ~80 miles (120km) apart. I&#x27;m very new to network design, trying to rule options in/out.

 Anyhow, they have about 25-30 switches throughout their building. Since there&#x27;s no documentation I&#x27;d like to map it out before I rip/replace with our own gear. Anyone know of any tools/demos/OSS mapping software for a single scan and map output to visio or similar? I see Solarwinds has a demo but i think it cripples the output to visio. I don&#x27;t want to buy something just for a one-off.

                              <span>I figured I&#x27;d pick the brains of some fellow IT geeks! I should admit I&#x27;m no networking expert so what I&#x27;m asking might be totally stupid so just bear with me.
 We have been working on a network monitoring project for a client, we are using nProbe to collect NetFlow/sFlow from different devices (ASA for example), flows are then exported downstream to an ELK stack where we visualize traffic and generate alerts in case of problems.
 As a late request from the client, we have been asked to monitor BGP backward transitions as well, I know we can set up specific SNMP traps to monitor BGP events effectively but what about NetFlow data, do you think it&#x27;s possible to monitor BGP events (esp backward transitions) using NetFlow data ? if so what metrics should I be looking for? 
 Hope my question is clear, happy to provide more information if needed.

 I have the Air Console application running. However, I’m trying to harden it a bit more as it’s currently running on DNS.
 Does anyone know if it’s possible to set up 2FA on the log in page?
 I’m opened to suggestions.

I don&#x27;t mean outsourced accounting but somebody that can help when the web connector will not install, when the QB Time is not displaying the custom fields, etc. Any contacts would be greatly appreciated.

 I am trying to build report for a call queue in my domain. Has anyone successfully built a report where it gives you the agent that picked up the call and the duration? I have tired Updated auto attendant and call queue historical reports - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn but it doesn&#x27;t appear to give me what I am after. 
 Thanks in advance and Happy New Years!

                              <span>I posted a while back about an interview I had. Would be swapping industries from local govt to a private healthcare company.
 First interview went great, nailed it I think. They called me back for a follow up today to meet with the CIO. Also went really well.
 In the course of the discussion I asked about their health coverage. I have a wife and son and we all have medical needs in some capacity. I was given a copy of their benefits handbook for new hires and was told to expect a call within the next day or so.
 Once I was home and settled I took a look at the health coverage and HOLY CRAP!
 Even their lowest tier plan was more than double what I am currently paying through my counties insurance and they are both Florida Blue.
 I thought that it had to be the total before the employer contribution so I reached out to the recruiter and he passed the question along to the companies HR.
 They confirmed that those numbers are the employee share. Their initial offer was 13k more than what I&#x27;m making now but would actually be a 7k pay CUT after selecting the plan that provided the coverage we need.
 I countered and told them I would need 5k more than the top advertised range for it not be a total wash. 30 minutes later I got a call saying they could go up to the max, but not above it and I had to politely decline their offer.
 I was honestly shocked at how expensive their coverage was and how little it covered. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been in the public sector for the last decade but there is no way I can see paying $1700/mo to cover myself, wife and son just so that mental health visits are included.
 I was also baffled that their mid tier (still 1300/mo) was the same plan number I am currently enrolled in BCBS 5302 but my coverage (PPO) has FULL coverage for counseling and mental health office visits, no co-pay or anything.
 Oh well...

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just recently received my forms for my merit increase this year. I&#x27;m not going to get into how much of a joke the amount is, how with inflation I&#x27;m technically taking a pay-cut for the 3rd year in a row. No, that&#x27;s been said before. I want to call out this blurb:
 &quot;To protect your private information, details of your compensation should not be shared with other employees...&quot;
 It goes on to say that you should contact HR if you have any questions/concerns/etc... about your pay. I have read several articles and forums that suggest we should in fact be talking more openly about our salaries. That would encourage fairness and quality. That would allow job seekers to know what the starting pay is along with how much others in that same position make after a few years of tenure. However, in the real world knowing that Slacker McCoy over there doing 10% of the work gets paid the same as me, and Flipper Jones in the other building makes more than me, would really build some resentment and in turn a hostile work environment. I can see it from both of those points of view.
 Unions are pretty open about their salaries and public (government) jobs are typically a line item on a budget someplace and public information, so you can find that too. Is it because companies need to stay competitive so they keep compensation a tightly guarded secret?
 ​
 EDIT: Good convo so far but leaning heavily on the legality of the request. That wasn&#x27;t really what I was getting at. I rather like my job and the organization I work for. We have posted pay ranges and grades so I know roughly what most people are making, if I cared to look it up. I was just wondering what the general thought was behind the secrecy amongst peers.

                              <span>We are considering dropping our current MDR service provider and looking at Artic Wolf. Their claim to fame is their customer service along with their agents and network sensors. 
 My question is, how good is their agent compared to Redcloak for instance? Also they say we get a dedicated security analysis that learns our environment and advises us accordingly on what changes to make to better improve our security posture.How much truth is there to this? Is this person like a security consultant or do they just report back on what Artic Wolf sees?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m not sure if you have had issues with quickbooks like my company has. I&#x27;m hoping we can get some push on quickbooks side to get this resolved and allow us to fully automate it.
 I will share some code here I hope to open source later on how its accomplished. But won&#x27;t be able to fully opensource the solution as of writing this. The problem I&#x27;m currently having is their major versions do not upgrade the same way as their program updates so you have to use a completely separate way of doing that. The reason is they haven&#x27;t updated their program in years that does the upgrading up quickbooks desktops.
 In Visual Studio after Quickbooks is installed you will find COM objects that have been registered. The ones I use are these. Intuit ServiceMGR, Intuit QBDAgent, and QBInstanceFind…</span>

                              <span>*Edit: Thanks guys! Learned A LOT from your responses. It seems that what I initially believed was a 50/50 blame scenario, actually is more or less 100 % on the regional health department in Mid-Norway. From the looks of it, they really weren&#x27;t prepared for this and did not know what they were ordering. In Norwegian media, although the department gets blamed a lot, the great unknown (a.k.a Epic and software in general) do get most of the blame). Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not involved in this plane crash of a project at all, but was wondering what your thoughts were. You rock! 
 
 So, a few months in after implementing an Epic EHR/EPR-based invoice/journal/+++ system in Mid-Norway, the regional health services is somewhat &#x27;in shatters&#x27;.

I setup the user account, manage groups and SharePoint, and other backend stuff. They have a third party that handles on prem file and printer sharing and hardware maintenance. 
 I set up a new user and the third party reached out for their credentials to setup up printing. I gave them the email address. they replied back and asked for their password. I got confused and called the local branch manager and they say that they all have to give them their user passwords in case they need to login and do anything. I told them to not do that and explained why.
 Is this ever a common practice? am I missing anything? As i am typing this I received an email from the user the third party it management company requesting the users password directly.

                              <span>Hello and happy Monday!
 My on-site IT team sometimes struggles with company ownership that we&#x27;re not always constantly available to assist with very basic end-user support like sharing the screen on MS Teams, setting their phone to DND, etc.. We&#x27;re of course just busy with various modernization efforts OR assisting other users. We make reference materials available but they&#x27;re not always utilized. My defense is usually that basic things like this are a waste of IT resources and end-users in today&#x27;s age should be expected to handle these things in today&#x27;s increasingly technological world if they want to work in an office setting.
 My personal gripes aside, I was just wondering what you guys would consider to be baseline minimum of IT skills for white-collar office professionals in current-year?
 I would probably name things like:
  
Login/logout, basic authentication, your &#x27;Windows&#x27; password versus your email password being separate distinct credentials,
 Email usage basics, out-of-office/vacation responders, etc.,
 Phone usage basics, softphone, voicemail greeting and OOO replies, etc.,

                              <span>Somehow I&#x27;ve managed to go decades without knowing this was a thing. Generally, when opening a ream of paper, the seam side is what should be printed on first; Some reams are even marked with an arrow.
 To not load the paper correctly can make jams more likely, and can cause the paper to curl excessively. This is mainly due to the manufacturing process.
 Hopefully I&#x27;m not alone in this. I wonder how many jams could have been avoided.
 Edit: It&#x27;s extremely amusing to me that their are a handful of people that seem to deny that this is even a thing. Here&#x27;s a regular ream of printer paper that specifies &quot;print side&quot;. Apparently this paper is used specifically for forms.
 Edit2: Ream
 Thanks to yakkerman, and admiraljkb for the confirmation.

                              <span>I have two separate environments. In both cases, the operating system and domain levels are the same. Win 2016.
 Env1 created ten years ago. Persistent errors. Env2 created three years ago. Clean! No errors that I can find.
 Env1 I&#x27;m getting persistent errors. If I look back at historical logs, we have had this problem since October 2022 at least (prior to the Nov patch problems).
 In Env1 if I look at the logs in Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy/Operational I don&#x27;t see any problems at all. No errors in processing for users logging on. In addition, if I execute &quot;gpupdate&quot; in the cmd line, it succeeds without problems.
 However if I look at the System log, I see the recurring events every two hours.
 Event ID 40970 The security system has detected a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN LDAP/host1.domain@domain with error code &#x27;The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information (0xc000006d). Authentication was denied.&#x27;
 Event ID 40970 The security system has detected a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN LDAP/host2.domain@domain with error code &#x27;The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information (0xc000006d). Authentication was denied.&#x27;
 Event ID 1030 The processing of group policy failed....
 After rebooting a server, the problem goes away. But randomly, it will begin on a domain server and then persist indefinitely until rebooted. Then on another day, another server is affected the same way. It could be any server that becomes affected. It seems to occur at any random time. No other problems seem to present in the environment. 
 The goal though is to remove these errors and to fix whatever issue exists in the domain.
 I&#x27;m wondering what the connection is between event ID 40970 and 1030 and where to look for clues here. Does anyone have any ideas?

                              <span>I know this sounds dumb and all but: 
 I am looking for a way to map drives to a server based on their location, I think this has to be done with DFS name spaces but limitations prevent that at this time. 
 So does anyone have a creative way to map a drive to the local server if a user login happens at site B so it uses the server at site B.

                              <span>Ive seen some chatter on here in the past about network-wide blocking of bad things. Namely this time around TikTok. And I started to wonder, who makes that call in your org?
 In my org, I block bad stuff on the router level, but when it comes to TikTok, Ive never given it much thought. 
 How have you gotten to the decision to block that? And what else do you block? Lastly, what’s been the blowback?

I have a computer at work that is a standalone Windows 10 machine but I would like to only allow a select group of users (admins) have access to the CD drive and external devices (preventing people from adding programs or extracting data) . For the life of me, I have looked around and it appears that in order to gain this level of granularity, I need Windows Server to enforce this kind of group policy, but as I stated before it&#x27;s a standalone system. Any ideas or help would be great! TIA!

 I previously worked for an MSP that had a client that had RDS access, their RDS and GW servers where separate. If you tried to access to server IP address to the RDS GW it would act if those there wasn&#x27;t a website there but users were able to connect through RDS using 2FA. The 2FA part I can easily do on my own its just the security lock down of the GW so it doesn&#x27;t broadcast IIS I am trying to figure out.

                              <span>Got a strange one here. 
 I have a distribution group that was created on premise and synced to O365 with AD Sync. It has been working fine for years. We had some staff terminations that affect this group and as part of our offboarding we removed the user accounts from all their groups.
 However, 365 still shows them in the group. I have checked repeatedly that there is no trace of either user in the AD object, and I see no errors in the AD Sync logs, but 365 still has them present. I can&#x27;t remove them in 365 because it&#x27;s an AD-mastered object. 
 Short of deleting the group completely and starting a fresh one (which we will eventually do anyway in our normal DG -&gt; MS Teams upgrade process), any ideas? 
 One note - this domain used to have on premise exchange, but the removal was extremely thorough and no trace of the old org exists. I have no on-prem Exchange management tools available to troubleshoot, the Ex2019 installer fails to install the tools because it can&#x27;t find the org. So I&#x27;m not sure this is even solvable.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of helping a company migrate some servers to Azure including some DC&#x27;s. A co-worker of mine is adamant about migrating the Sysvol replication group onto a different server but, that isn&#x27;t needed right? 
 From my understanding as long the DC&#x27;s are online they will replicate regardless unless we disable it.
 I see the replication group in DFS on our new file server in Azure. Anything I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>So we are currently looking into ways to make our patch day let&#x27;s say more automatic.
 I have a few ideas on how to do that I am currently working on PSUpdate and a script that I would push out to our server via PDQ.
 I would really like to know how the rest of the world updates their environment (we are a really small company).
 Thanks

                              <span>I work in a medium sized not for profit organisation.
 Our organisation use primarily Google docs/sheets and Airtables to record all our info.
 Im looking for a filing system app that would, amongst other things, allow us to save both the Google docs and the Airtable docs in the same folder.
 Does any such app exist? (and preferably one that is affordable!)
 Many thanks in advance?

                              <span>How does the CPU speed factor in on a Hyper-V host? 
 I have two brand new Dell R650&#x27;s with Gold 2.40Ghz CPUs, under Windows performance it shows base speed: 2.39Ghz while the actual speed under &quot;speed&quot; is 2.99Ghz. So how does that factor in, do the base CPU speed actual run at 2.99 (3) Ghz though it&#x27;s reporting 2.39Ghz?

                              <span>Bit of an odd one to start my Monday morning. We have a Microsoft Teams Team that contains a host of files/folders that certain staff members need access to. Usual stuff there. 
 Management now want all staff to be able to see these files/folders in a read only manner, but they don&#x27;t want them added to the Team under any circumstances. So essentially I need to give all staff access to the SharePoint backend without adding them to the group, as this will add them to the MS Team. Got to love it, right?
 My first thought was some kind of Flow to just replicate the files from location X into location Y which all staff can access. However just in case I&#x27;m missing something I figured I&#x27;d ask here. 
 Have a good week folks!

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I have a strange issue, I have multiple users having problems where they keep receiving Outlook Acceptance emails. I&#x27;ve tried troubleshooting the issue with 2 different users but can&#x27;t seem to figure this out. They have created the recurring meetings from their Outlook app on their laptop.
 As far as I can see from other forums, then the issue could be many things.. One of them from the iPhone, but as written, the meetings has been created from the laptop?
 We use Office 365 and the problem has been here since November month where I received the first ticket about the problem.
 Does anyone have any idea what to do?

                              <span>Hi All, another &quot;I&#x27;m feeling burnt out&quot; type post but I want to aim this around projects I have been booked on.
 In my organisation we constantly have projects ongoing which are managed by dedicated PMs but I&#x27;ve found that there&#x27;s only a handful of sys admins the PMs want because of our experience, work ethic and skill. 
 As such the same people are always booked on huge, complex projects. 
 I myself am on 3 large projects all with similar deadlines and I&#x27;m fully booked until end of April now, so I can&#x27;t take a single day off. Some days the PMs expect me to work Out of hours to do their project as there isn&#x27;t enough time in hours as il end up as double booked.
 Not forgetting that I have my usual sys admin responsibilities to deal with (tickets, licence management, knowledge management)
 How and what can I say to my manager, the pms and head of serivce to basically ease up on my work load. (I can&#x27;t expect them to reassign some projects because no-one will touch my poweshell scripts and will take me a week++ to get someone up to speed) 
 I had two weeks off over Xmas and it was glorious but my first 4 days back have been the longest month ever.

                              <span>As a sysadmin, I&#x27;m used to dealing with some pretty crazy requests. But this one takes the cake. My boss just asked me to install a pirated version of Windows on all the company&#x27;s computers because he heard it was cheaper than buying legitimate licenses.
 I tried to explain to him that not only is this illegal, but it&#x27;s also a huge security risk. But he wouldn&#x27;t listen. He said we needed to &#x27;save money wherever we can.&#x27;
 I&#x27;m at a loss for what to do. I don&#x27;t want to break the law or put our company at risk, but I also don&#x27;t want to lose my job. Any advice from my fellow sysadmins?

                              <span>Hi There,
 I am after some advise in the best way to create a RAID volume on a server core machine, either in powershell or if there is a way to remotely access disk management to do this.
 Any advise appreciated

                              <span>Hi folks :) I hope it’s the right place to ask this question.
 From time to time I have to make an IT presentation for 10-20 people with several labs - task - in between 
 And it’s kinda always pain in the a.. to see when the majority of people have finished there tasks..
 Is there maybe a simple webpage with a tool where I could share a link - and if someone is finished his task he can click - I am ready- and I could see it? After everyone is finished - I could reset it for all.

For example, Can I use the Federate access (SSO with AAD) to let users access the Bastion Host, then assign them permissions/roles at the AWS?
 Anyone can advise?

                              <span>Hey all, I apologise for formatting as I am on my phone!
 Currently I want to expand my market worth and just knowledge in different areas. At work my permissions are restricted somewhat, we are an international company and even though my department operates without the complete oversight of our mother branch, permissions are restricted which is normal.
 I am looking at getting the dev program licence for 365 so I can actually evaluate the entirety of it and get the full picture. I am an admin in the majority of areas but can’t go running around Willy nilly and start playing with global settings. 
 Currently I am looking at getting docker, vmware (the backend stuff I don’t understand) and maybe centOS so I can learn Linux a bit more and of course my own 365 tenant.
 Do you peeps have any suggestions on sought after platforms and what free resources they have? Or an insight on “what’s the next big thing”? 
 Any and all suggestions are appreciated!
 P.S my work does fund training but that is already being used in more network related areas.

 I have one at my current employer, he heads up the Service desk. Generally he is a quiet guy that doesnt bother me but once a month or so he finds something and keeps harping on and trying to make me look bad.
 Asshat user &#x3D; Manager
 Examples.
 Manager recently had a staff member leave, so new guy comes in. We work remotely, but have an office. Manager insisted that the new guy uses his own pc as we pay in on our laptops and the new guy cant afford one. Reality of that situation is our office pays a hefty portion and honestly the guy could get a good enough machine and not have to pay a cent. BUT I think it would have screwed with managers budget and manager didnt want that. I took it up with my manager but both of us …</span>

 I found out who it was and removed them from our Exchange, i went from being blacklisted on 3 Blacklists to only one ( UCEPROTECTL3 ). They don&#x27;t accept any removal requests.
 It has been 5 days since blocking the spammer and i still can&#x27;t send messages to gmail, return message is Our system has detected that this message is likely unsolicited mail. To reduce the amount of spam sent to Gmail, this message has been blocked. 
 What would you do first to be able to send mails to gmail again? Implement DMARC and DKIM?
 Wait for one more blacklist to expire?
 Use Google PostMaster tool?

 We have an old server running AD. As we are moving to AAD, all users have been synced to AAD, converted into cloud only with the delete--&gt;Restore trick, and are not having any issues.
 What would the correct steps be from here? Just shut down the server and forget all about it?

                              <span>Hello fellow network gurus. I&#x27;ve been tasked with getting ISE to work with Fortinet APs, that are controlled from a Fortigate. Part of me is thinking there shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, since everything is RADIUS based, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a good example or write up. Have any of you seen this done? All is currently working fine on Cisco AireOS WLCs, and with a virtual 9800 controller. 
 Thanks!!!!

 One part of this would be setting up a site to site connection with a vendor. 
 What would happen if both sides have the same subnets for interesting traffic? Site A advertises 10.10.10/24 and the same for site B? Would I have to NAT Site B&#x27;s incoming traffic as it hits my firewall?

                              <span>So long story short, I am trying to add a dumb wifi router to our IT room so we can troubleshoot VPN issues for end users as if they were offsite connected to a public wifi connection. 
 Currently when they try to replicate their VPN issues in-house, because everything goes through the firewall it fails at 10% and does not connect. The solution to this is to have someone pull out their phone and set up a wireless hotspot and connect to that, and then log into the VPN for testing. Often times someone won&#x27;t have a data plan that supports hotspots, or or signal is weak, so it&#x27;s kind of a pain to test VPN in-house, but knowing their VPN is going to work when going off site is also critical.
 So my big bright idea was to plug in a dumb little Netgear router I had from home into our equipment at…</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been doing networking for some years. I spent a while in a couple NOCs and worked with tens of thousands of telco circuits ranging from ISDN to 100G wave and dark fiber.
 In my time I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a pain in the ass ticket like I&#x27;ve been working on for a couple months now. So I wanted to get the group&#x27;s opinions as people with more experience than me.
 So here&#x27;s the skinny. I&#x27;ve had a ticket open with  for about 3 months now on a single problem child 10G wave circuit between two of my regional DCs. It&#x27;s one of two redundant links running on a diverse path. Both sides of my equipment show the same problems at the same time. They&#x27;ll show the interface connecting to the circuit going down with a reason of Link failure. It&#x27;ll be down a…</span>

                              <span>I recently switched my ASA to use RADIUS (from LDAPS), with a Windows NPS server, also using the AzureMFA extension, and I&#x27;m finding a few limitations that I&#x27;m hoping someone else has solved?
 I&#x27;m using MSCHAPv2, and I&#x27;ve been steering people toward using the Push Notification option as their default as that and phone calls appear the be the only two supported methods when using CHAP.
 It&#x27;s been working great, however I&#x27;ve had users get confused and forget to check their phones to hit approve. The AnyConnect client doesn&#x27;t give any feedback about needing them to accept the push notification.
 Has anyone done anything to work around this? Is there any customization that can be done in AnyConnect to show them that they need to accept the request?
 I see that the PAP option has more options, but 1. isn&#x27;t PAP considered insecure? 2. I am using class 25 to send back a tunnel group after they login, and from what I&#x27;m reading in other threads, PAP may break that functionality with Windows NPS.
 I did see this about PAP in a Cisco doc, but I&#x27;m still a bit uneasy about using PAP:
  
By default, the ASA uses the unencrypted Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication type. This does not mean that the ASA sends the password in plain text when it sends the RADIUS REQUEST packet. Rather, the plaintext password is encrypted with the RADIUS shared secret.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the middle of designing a new network. Two redundant data centers. Multiple sites connecting back via a collapsed core design. We are going with Aruba CX for route, switch, and Wi-Fi.
 I&#x27;m looking for recommendations for internal network segmentation. Aruba&#x27;s Dynamic Segmentation using identity-based access looks interesting. Is anyone running this that has any thoughts? Or is segmenting internal networks through a NGFW still the best practice? I feel like the cost and scalability of this option is a little concerning. Also, are there any other segmentation technologies or methodologies people like or are gaining popularity?
 I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time looking into these options. Including talking to various vendors. but I wanted an outside perspective.

                              <span>Hi,
 I wonder if any one knows any solution for me to split one ethernet cable in to two but also send PoE for both devices. Originally there is one camera but need to add another device that will need network and PoE as well. So 2 pairs for one and two for other device. I know that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if there is no PoE as normally it&#x27;s just two pairs for data is used. Any device/adaptor/converter to send the power over the same four data wires? Tnx.

                              <span>I work in a place with CAT5e that need to be replaced. Since we have a couple of buildings (100/300 meters away from where cores are), I thought GPON could be an option to distribute network to the entire place, instead of only connecting buildings. This also could help with my concern about EMI in some areas.
 I don&#x27;t have that many endpoints (around 200 total), but price end up being interesting, because of transceivers/switches/licenses that would need to be replaced with a CAT6 project too.
 ​
 So, anyone uses GPON?
 As someone that never worked with, I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

                              <span>Greetings: Any recommendation for a simple enough animation tool, better than ppt and less complicated than adobe suite, where a very basic animation can be produced? 
 Intent is to use infographics for a wide range of org members to inform changes introduced from traditinal vpn to now 3rd party vpn service. The animation will be more geared towards non-technical personnel to assist in information dissemination exercise. 
 As a last resort, already started meddling with ppt animation and watching youtube videos however pointers to 3rd party utilities will be much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with configuring Cisco switches so that some code (a TCP server) running on a Windows PC can communicate with some clients, while having link and hardware redundancy.
 Unfortunately I am not a network engineer and so have had trouble setting up the switches in the best way possible.
 The current topology looks like this, basically everything is connected to everything, the idea being that server A (or B) can talk to all clients even if one of the switches goes down, with all the links being doubled as well.
 A relatively default configuration of the switches works, however whenever one of the links goes down, or anything requiring a topology update, the reconfiguration will easily take 2min, which seems way too long to me for such a &quot;simple&quot; network.
 Are there ways to configure the switches and ports so that a switchover would essentially be instant (a few seconds) in case of a failure? I looked up LACP but it&#x27;s not clear to me if that could even be applied in this case were the redundant paths are not on the same switch.
 I feel like there should be some straight-forward configuring I should be able to do before I start tweaking hello times and whatnot... especially since the network is fixed and will essentially be locked in a black-box with everything having fixed IPs with no risk of having random devices connected by accident.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have the following secenario: https://imgbox.com/XxGMkMOi
 I would Like to reach PC-B from PC-A with RDP. I have a static NAT rule in the asa 192.168.50.6-&gt;192.168.1.6. So I can reach 1.6 via 50.6 outside. If I put a laptop on the outside it works fine, i can reach PC-A via the tunnel too. I opened up the firewall completely and I do not even see hitcount on the acces lists when I would like to RDP from PC-A to PC-B.
 The tunnel is up and working. Important that the two ends of the tunnel are 2 routers not the firewall. I cannot put the router behind the firewall because it is a GSM router.
 Is it even possible to reach PC-B from PC-A? Since I have to &quot;leave&quot; the tunnel on the other side. If yes please give me a few tips becuase I am out of ideas.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I will upgrade an HA pair Firepower 5516-X with FTD module that is in active/passive state. 
 When reading the documentations on how to upgrade a Firepower that are in HA, it makes me wonder about the HA function in Firepower. And to mention, I come from the Fortiworld...
 Documentation: Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.3 - System Management [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense] - Cisco 
 Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.3 - High Availability (Failover) [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense] - Cisco 
 In the first link, it says:
  
If you are upgrading the units in a high availability group, upgrade the standby device, switch modes to swap the active/standby units, then install the upgrade on the new standby device. 
  
If I understand it correctly, does it say that before upgrading, I need first to switch the active unit to the secondary and make the secondary unit active. From the secondary active unit, I upgrade the secondary active unit itself. And when secondary active unit is upgraded, I&#x27;ll switch to the primary firewall and make it active and upgrade the primary active unit. 
 Have I interpreted it correctly? From the Fortigate world, you just login to the firewall and upgrade it from the active unit; it will first upgrade the secondary and after that it will upgrade the primary, all by itself. In the firepower, it seems that I manually need to do the upgrade on both firewalls. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ll appreciate your insight on this one.

                              <span>There are currently about 11 AnyConnect profiles in the Cisco ASA5555 configuration. I would like to know if it is possible to extract the logs for each profile, what users were active during the last 30 days? I want to clean up and delete unnecessary profiles. Thanks.

                              <span>Our main infrastructure uses Aruba CX 6x00 serie switch and we manage everything with SSH and CLI. We really love them and have no issue so far.
 I have to setup a few temporary remote branches, but I don&#x27;t have the budget for aruba switches.
 The remote branches would each be about MAX 10 workstations with a 10GB single mode fiber uplink, so a single 16 port switch should be enough.
 Can you recommend a low cost solution (&lt;500$) for a 16 port switch with 10GB uplink that would be manageable with CLI(SSH) (we only need layer 2 for VLAN and MSTP). No power redundancy is required. And most importantly, that would have no issue with the Aruba uplink? I know it should be industry standard, but I&#x27;ve been bitten a lot of times by low cost solutions in the past, and I prefer not to lose time.
 I found the D-Link DGS-1510 line, but I have no idea what it is worth management wide, as I never touched anything else than main vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Arista and HPE/Aruba).
 The aruba uplink is a 6300 (JL658A). I don&#x27;t have the SFP modules yet. Fiber is single mode OS2.

                              <span>Lets say I have an app that can be self hosted by the customer and I also host a SAAS that the self hosted app can connect to by making HTTP requests
 ​
 Lets say one of the customers is running a forward proxy on their host for outgoing traffic. And because of this proxy requests from my app to the SAAS i host are not able to get through.
 ​
 Can the NO_PROXY variable be used to circumvent this like &#x60;NO_PROXY&#x3D;https://saas.com\&#x60; 
 If yes then once NO_PROXY is set which software is it used by? 
 is my app that is making the requests supposed to read this env var and set something special in the request so that it goes through without the forward proxy
 ​
 or is it supposed to be read by forward proxy so that it acts like a sort of allow list in the forward proxy and lets the request from my app pass through to the internet?

                              <span>Hey everyone I’ve been assigned a project to upgrade a clients catalyst switches and swap them out with meraki. I have one glaring question the catalyst switches are functioning as the dhcp server at each of the 6 sites. 
 The meraki switches cannot act as a dhcp so my solution was to setup a windows server vm which would act as the dhcp server for all sites they would connect to this vm with site to site vpn’s.
 Then I would setup L3 routing and interfaces on the switch and relay the request to the VM. Is this possible or am I way off the mark any help or pointers is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Work at a software company that needs to get Android devices (about 50 for the pilot - then company-wide, which is ~200 phones) into employees hands to beta test preview builds of our app. These devices don&#x27;t need a cellular plan and we don&#x27;t want to buy plans, we just need them on wifi to receive the latest builds off Firebase.
 Google Store TOS says 10 devices of a model per account before you get banned, Android&#x27;s EMM directory of resellers have shot us down for low volume (they wanted an initial order in the thousands, which we don&#x27;t need). At this point I&#x27;m even willing to forego EMM + zero-touch enrollment, simply because we need devices.
 Trying to target popular current models - so along the lines of Pixel 7 or S22.
 tl;dr Any ideas where to procure a &quot;large&quot; (compared to consumers) but &quot;small&quot; (compared to large enterprise) numbers of unlocked, SIM-less/no service Android phones?

                              <span>Before you suggest the Tripp Lite/Keyspan one, I have one. It&#x27;s great ... except:
 I run Windows 11 in Core Isolation/Memory Integrity mode. A lot of these old devices have ancient drivers that won&#x27;t run in such a mode. Does anyone know of any USB-RS232 adapter that has drivers that will work without me turning off basic security features?

My current organization has flagged third party, legacy software, vulnerability management, and identity management as top risks and a focus of mitigation efforts this year.
 Looking forward to any feedback!

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 ​
 I work for a small MSP and one of the roles i have is to do an inventory of customers equipment. As it is now, i have an excel sheet that i go to the customer&#x27;s site, and go through each computer, 1 by 1, noting down the system specs and info (like serial # and IP address) on each computer, then i move on to network devices like printers, switches, routers, APs, etc.
 Is there any easy way this can be done? 
 Most cases this is only done with NEW customers, so we dont have full access to their network yet, and are just assessing the network, so we wouldn&#x27;t have installed any RMM agents or anything YET. Only after the audit is completed, and we propose a contact with them, and they accept, do we go forward with RMM tools.
 ​
 What im looking for is a tool i can use before the later stages of us installing, example, ninjarmm agents on the computers.
 ​
 In short, is there any software (preferably free, but will consider paid as well, depending on the price), that i can arrive on someone&#x27;s network, plug into their network (or connect wireless), and scan taht subnet, and get all the system info for all devices? (Even if i have to enter like a domain admin credential to allow it to authroize the scan on domain computers).

                              <span>So I am still fairly fresh in the sysadmin game (2 years) but I feel I am being underpaid for my workload. I deal with Virtualization, Microsoft Online (Exchange and Azure), Microsoft Server and Client side, and finally sometimes team lead/project management while onsite at projects (while doing my other workload). Presently they pay me 50k CAD (~37k USD), I am required to travel with most expenses being covered (Gas, Food, misc expenses but I need to upfront the costs). 
 ​
 Do you think asking for 60-65k (45-48k USD) would be fair as i have gotten no pay raises since my hire.

All that being said I do aspire on becoming a system admin one day and wanted to know if it is a must to know powershell/Linux/Bash scripting and automation. Also as a sys admin what are some things I must know as a sys admin that you guys encounter on a day to day basis? I’m looking to learn as much as I can.

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m basically been given the choice to become a devops or continue/go back to programming of sorts but I&#x27;ve been absolutely on the fence for a while now as I guess its a bit of identity crisis, I&#x27;ve been on loan to this devops team for around 2 years now, doing mostly beginner devops sort of things but I come from a programmer background (by this I mean uni - c++/c#/javascript whatnot), my original team did full stack from backend to front end (so sql/a couple of database languages through to html/javascript) but it was put on hold and if I go back (it hasnt been made clear what I&#x27;d fully go back to but..) I&#x27;m most likely to end up doing mostly backend stuff (which honestly isn&#x27;t my ideal choice).
 It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like devops work (least what I&#x27;ve seen so far) it&#x27;s just part of me I guess will always be a programmer in nature (I just can&#x27;t see it in the backend work we do). 
 Has anyone been in a similar position before? I&#x27;m honestly at this point leaning I guess towards the devops work just as a bit of future proofing I guess, but in my brain its a bit of a mess of what I should really pick/would be happy doing.

 Hi Everyone
 I have been tasking with upgrading all devices at a client from 2013 Office Pro Plus to 2019 Pro Plus I have to do this for approximately 80 Computers. 
 I want to avoid downloading the installer on every device so I have specified a source for the installer. 
  
I have a folder on a shared network drive that has the xml/setup/setup files: Folder/XML File. &quot;Office&quot; is where the installer files are 
 I have a batch file that has the install command setup.exe /configure Configuration.xml
  
When I remote into a test device, and run this batch file, I get an issue where office &quot;Fails to Download&quot; 
 Searched up and down all over the web and I cant find anything specific to ODT
 https://imgur.com/a/as8nkFz
 If I remove my source path and let it download the installer runs fine,
 Does anyone know what might be causing this? Id rather not have the deployment download the files 80+ times on every device as this will hammer the network too much
 Thanks

                              <span>Been a sysadmin now for 3 years now, and after a recent large project, I’m feeling quiet burnt out. My team has 3 on the team, and I feel very stagnant. I am not sure what to do. I worry a lot about switching positions or careers but feel quiet rudderless at the moment. The hours seems to be getting endless and no time where I feel like things are “complete”.
 Maybe this will be deleted idk, just looking for some help. Maybe it’s my company (small org)

                              <span>I am hoping to understand why IT is also always outsource. 
 For example I am company A that goes to company B for IT services, company B outsource to C and D and so on. Quality drop because it workers are treated like crap, low pay no benefits etc. And companies also suffer because they get bad services. 
 Here&#x27;s another example comp A outsource to Company B. Company be sends Billy to be there full time and look after then. Billy get paid $20 hour and company B bill company A $100 for Billy... Billy is not happy. Company B suffer too. Why doesnt bring all IT back in house and treat them like humans.

                              <span>Started doing IT work last year, and I inherited the last person&#x27;s backpack. Great to have it but it is enormous on me; he was a big guy. I have narrow shoulders and am short, to boot, so it hangs too low and is pretty uncomfortable walking around wearing it when it is full of 15&quot; laptop, chargers, cables, misc parts and batteries, etc. I saw this thread on different sub, and the Everiki Atlas looks great except some Amazon comments say it is large for a small person to wear comfortably. Looking at other posts on this sub, I do love Swiss Gear but yeah, too big. Comfort matters more as I age.
 Any small people who have recommendations? Some brands make &quot;women specific&quot; packs for narrow shoulders and smaller frames, but these are mostly hiking type backpacks. I like the multi-section approach of a tech specific pack like the Atlas, and since I also want to use it as an under-the-seat backpack for personal travel, I appreciate the extra features of easy access top pocket, sleeve, etc. I may just buy a 11-15&quot; Atlas and try it, but thought I&#x27;d check here first. Thanks.

                              <span>I know somehow, it&#x27;s ridiculous scenario but I need to know what would happen (Just in Case)
 I always been curious if I downgrade the license for one user from Exchange P2 to P1 (Or E3 to Business Standard ) while user is already having 70GB of emails in his storage. 
 I think after downgrading to P1 he will have 50GB of his emails still exist but what about the other 20GB he has before? where would it go? especially If I returned back his Exchange P2 license again would the emails appear like nothing happen? 
 Did Microsoft talk about it in any documentation? thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 We are hybrid tenant environment with (Azure Basic subscription)
 My boss is asking me to protect the users whose entering our SharePoint sites from (Printing or Downloading ) the documents in whole library 
 Most users having ( Business Standard License ) few having ( E3 ) 
 From my understanding my case this would be applicable by having Azure P2 subscription in our tenant and users having at least M365 E5 License in order to activate AIP am not sure does anyone have an idea about it ? 
 Thanks,

                              <span>I often find myself in a situation where I have to send login credentials via e-mail or chat. In many cases to people from external companies who are not members of our password manager (BitWarden). Often they are non-technical users so it should be as simple as possible for them.
 What is a more secure way to send passwords to other people?
 Edit: I like the idea of one time links. I am just afraid that some users wont save/remember/write-down the passwords and i will have to send it to them over and over again.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m looking for an open source tool that will capture specific usage metrics (CPU, Memory, etc) for each process running. CheckMK does this wonderfully on Windows and Linux but not so well on Mac (at least I haven&#x27;t been able to get it going).
 Looking for a client/server model that does this. Do you guys know of any that fit these requirements?

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve just realised something that is a bit annoying. When I create a symbolic link to a network share, then navigate to that symbolic link and open any subfolder on that share, the context menu &quot;New&quot; option only shows the &quot;Folder&quot; option with the UAC logo. See this picture.
 These are the steps to recreate the issue:
 1. Create a symbolic link on a command prompt: mklink /d d:\LocalFolder\ \\NAS\NAS_Folder 2. Navigate to d:\LocalFolder 3. Open any subfolder inside that symbolic link. 4. Right click/New. You will see only the &quot;Folder&quot; option with the UAC shield. 
 It&#x27;s worth noting that if I directly access the \\NAS\NAS_Folder and open any subfolder, the New menu shows all available options and the UAC shield is gone.
 What&#x27;s going on and how could I prevent that behaviour? Disabling UAC from registry only gets rid of the shield but the context menu still shows just the Folder option.
 PS: I&#x27;ve tried this also on a recently installed Windows VM. Same thing happens.
 ​
 edit: This person is having a similar issue.

                              <span>We had the Last week a Huge Problem With the Login on our Terminalserverfarm. We have 2 Broker and 20 RDS Hosts for ~400 concurrent users. We use the User Profile Disk With Folder Redirection on this Farm.
 At Monday the Login process was very very Slow. The Login Stuck 10-15 Minutes at waiting for Profile Service. (All Servers run on a allflash Active Active Storage Cluster). 
 Yesterday i found the Problem of the Slow Login process. Foxit Reader Saved a huge of data in the default User /appdata/roaming on all Sessions Hosts. I removed this Folders and the Login was directly very fast again. Never had this Problem and have Not really found something about that at my searches.
 I Hope If you have Same Problems, this will help you. 
 In Near Future we will Upgrade to fslogix. ;-)

                              <span>So we have our default domain with Godaddy setup and it has the MX records for O365. Everything is working perfect here, no issues.
 We recently got a new domain. We do not want to use aliases, but separately licensed mailboxes in the same O365 Tenant. To send and receive mail to this new domain, we have to add MX records to it. If I add the MX records to the new domain, will this stop mail flow or affect our default domain in any way?
 Thank you for your help in advance.

                              <span>I have pretty granular control over the endpoints with our PA firewalls, but how is the sharing of passwords best handled when a legitimate use case exists. I was thinking of encoding the password to a physical token, barcode, RFID or something, sonat least a proper password can be applied; but that feels quite amateurish. Is there an off the shelf product suitable for low volume stuff like this.
 The legacy tools will be gone soon, just trying to have them &#x27;do better&#x27; in the meantime.
 Edit: domain login, Warehousing and manufacturing.

 In the next 2 months we will be migrating our on prem Exchange Server to 0365, approximately 150 mailboxes. I&#x27;d love to know from other people what lessons you learned, what went wrong, what worked really well, what pitfalls to avoid.... etc
 Can you all share any feedback or valuable insights as to what to be aware of?

 So basically a tool that could pick out interesting pieces of information that a human may not spot (or even think to look for). Or even produce stats that someone spends hours each month producing. Anything that may have added value to your business. Thanks

 We have a bunch of fixed desk on prem currently AD joined Imacs and a fair few MacBooks roaming around the globe. We&#x27;ve been using FileWave but it&#x27;s so convoluted we&#x27;re probably gonna change out this year so thoughts, pros and cons please. I&#x27;m all ears.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I had a quick question today - Has anyone created a form which users can fill (First name, last name, employee ID and email) which then goes to the sysadmin email distribution list for approval. The next step is a tad more complex - If approved, it would then make a local AD account automatically.
 I was looking for a solution using Power Automate, but that seems to be mostly aimed for Azure environments and I think needs a PS script to perform the LDAP related changes. I&#x27;ve also been investigating a locally hosted PHP/HTML/CSS/JS instance which could do this, but it&#x27;s not my strongest skill.
 I did see a paid product called Adaxes (I believe) which can do this, but ideally would like a free solution.
 Just looking for a solution to ease the flow of new staff members at my site this year.
 Any suggestions are welcome!
 Thanks!

 What has been done differently during enrolment to give these two behaviors and how can I as admin change and enforce the one I prefer?

                              <span>Hi, I am attempting to set up SnipeIt for my college theatre, as were getting a lot of new equipment during renovations, and are hoping to keep better track of it using Snipe It. However... I am not a very tech-savvy person, so I have been attempting to set up snipe it on both a raspberry pi, and now GCP for several weeks with no luck, even after referring to the documentation (and chat gpt for assistance).
 If I&#x27;m on a fresh install of ubuntu on GCP, are there any tips or tricks for setting it up? I know this seems like a very very vague question but I&#x27;ve just been really struggling and getting stuck at different points during each attempt. 
 (worst case scenario we could hire someone to set it up, as our college IT doesn&#x27;t want to get involved in our pet projects, but the goal is low cost)

Deny any inbound ICMP traffic to the office enterprise network by default for security and allow only from trusted monitoring sources as needed. 
 Allow all inbound ICMP for ease of monitoring (say circuit uptime) or troubleshooting convenience assuming the chances of an ICMP DoS attack on the office public IPs is potentially negligible.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Might be a stupid question but here goes....
 Were currently experiencing network performance issues, the internet speed is very slow on client devices that are hardwired into the network. All client devices are apparently negotiating at a 1Gbps connection but the network cabling in the walls does not look like it&#x27;s CAT 5E or higher, possible CAT 5 10 / 100 Mbps. All patch cables are CAT 5E and above.
 If the client devices connect to the network switch like the example below, will the computer negotiate at 1Gbps speed or will it say 100Mbps? 
 Client Device &gt; Cat 5E patch cable plugs into wall jack &gt; CAT ? &gt; goes to patch panel ? CAT 5E patch cables to the network switch.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been getting a lot more into fiber networking recently and I had some questions about the practicality of using fiber between networking devices in the rack. If you need a short run, lets say maybe 0.5 - 1 foot I know what you can get DAC cables of that length, but what about using SFP/SFP+ connectors with fiber cables into a LC/LC fiber keystone? 
 TLDR; From a practicality and performance standpoint, would there realistically be any issues with using SFP/+ modules and LC fiber cables to connect switching appliances for short runs instead of DAC? (excuse my ignorance with anything here lol new to fiber networking and trying to go 10Gig!)

                              <span>Hello all,
 just curious whats best practices for OSPF networks (single area). Let‘s say having a large network with many subnets in the range 10.0.0.0/8. The vlan interfaces are on different routers across the network. Would you rather configure the whole 10.0.0.0/8 on every OSPF routers, or just configure every interfaces subnet under area 0.

                              <span>hello all, 
 due to changes we&#x27;re 
 making for security reasons, we need to 
 add a vlan to our swithces but so it&#x27;ll be visible t o specific network.
 ​
 to make things clearer 
 we are creating a new network 
 segment dedicated to backup systems.
 that network needs to be accesible from a small
 number of computers. 
 ​
 our initial idea was to filter it via 
 fw but then again the new network
 might still be visible to others.
 ​
 is is possible to create some sort of 
 an access list per vlan?

 There is a big variation in internet speed depending on which room the client is in.
 How can I diagnose where the performance bottle neck is?

                              <span>I have a container that I want to expose to the public internet which acts as a proxy to a private subnet hosting a bunch of applications. The exposed container is an authentication proxy that validates auth headers before forwarding upstream to the private subnet.
 Is the idea to put the auth proxy container on the host network since host can communicate to all bridge networks? From here, I would put NGINX &amp; all software on a user-defined bridge network to isolate from the public internet but accessible via the auth container on the host network?
 Curious if I&#x27;m missing anything with respect to security and isolation.
 Example:
  
Auth Proxy: Network mode is host running on port 80 and 443 for plain HTTP and TLS
 
NGINX: Runs in user defined bridge network, let&#x27;s say 172.16.0.0/16
 
App 1: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.5
 
App 2: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.6
 
 I don&#x27;t want the public internet to be able to talk to NGINX or App 1 or App 2, but force communication to proxy through auth container bound to host. 
 As an additional question, is it true the host can always talk to a container on a user-defined bridge network? Is it possible to ensure only App1 &amp; App2 can only be communicate to via NGINX and not the host? I assume something like the following would suffice?

                              <span>Hi all We have a really special DNS usecase and I&#x27;m wondering if someone of you have a solution for this. We access our enviroments via Jump Host that tunnels HTTPS, RDP and SSH. We have S2S VPN from this Jumphost with BiNAT assigned via Netbox. We would like to connect to the destination via FQDN, only the Jumpbox need to resolve the destination host. So if your on-Site you can still connect with the same FQDN that resolves to &#x27;the real&#x27; local IP. Best case would be if we can translate all the IPs on-the-fly to the binat IP address that is used by the jumpxbox. Does ayone know a solution that could do this?

Last year I bought a bunch of cheap usb-c docking stations and they have turned out to be a nightmare. What are some things that we CAN cheap out on?

 Long time lurker, first time poster here. Apologies in advance if asking this kind of advice is not allowed in this community. I&#x27;m a PhD student in a medium sized lab (~20 researchers) who has inherited the job of designing and maintaining a shared compute environment for our research needs. The person who maintained our stack has moved on to greener pastures and I get the freedom now to make some decisions about how to deploy a compute cluster that is performant, user-friendly, and sensible to maintain. We have a budget to upgrade equipment, possibly move to the cloud, leverage campus HPC, or some combination. Any advice ya&#x27;ll can offer to point me in the right direction is greatly appreciated.

 We are completely in Azure AD, nothing on-prem. 
 Over the past few weeks ive been driving the project and working on how to enforce 2FA (specifically on MS Authenticator we do not want to use text or phone based authentication) 
 I created a conditional access policy that requires a user to use the authentication method within the custom authentication strength i made (first pic) I had tested the policy out for weeks even on a new test account on an intune enrolled laptop…</span>

                              <span>I currently have inherited a team of 6 engineers, with a requirement to support an office of 250 on-site users. The engineers currently work on a hybrid rota meaning they are on site 3 out of 5 days a week, and work from home the remaining 2. The team is currently made up of the following resources:
 4 x Permanent 2 x Contractors
 The plan is to keep the 2 contractors until I can hire permanent staff to replace their roles and transfer any knowledge. 
 Interested in hearing how others approach managing their teams from a rota basis. For example, should contractors be expected to be on-site 5-days a week unlike perm staff who are on-site 3? How about swapping days

According to them it was all cloud based customers. Happy weekend yall. They&#x27;re trying to fix all the SIP servers we&#x27;re tied to now.

                              <span>I have no idea how IIS works, so please forgive any obvious lack of some fundamental understanding with this question. After so many years of system admin experience, I honestly feel kinda silly typing all this out:
 So, I have a webserver at my office where multiple sites are hosted. So there are several domains all pointed to, for example 192.168.1.50. How is the traffic differentiated between domain1.com and domain2.com when IIS receives the traffic?
 If I am setting up a second webserver or troubleshooting dns issues, etc, I am aware that I can edit the hosts file locally to force a computer to resolve a particular domain to a different IP. So, for instance, if I am migrating one webserver to another, I can do preliminary testing by updating the local host file on a test PC. I guess my question is, is it possible to pull specific web pages via IP somehow, and not edit the hosts file?
 More specifically, if I simply browse to 192.168.1.50 I just get an IIS page. What would the syntax of the url be if I am able to pull a specific site by IP? I feel like there is some building block here that I&#x27;m missing that keeps me from really understanding what&#x27;s going on here.
 If my wall of text isn&#x27;t clear, heres an example scenario:
 Web Server 1 - 192.168.1.50
 DNS a record domain1.com 192.168.1.50
 DNS a record domain2.com 192.168.1.50
 I set up Webserver 2 and perform a migration.
 Webserver 2 192.168.1.51
 no DNS records, but IIS is serving out a copy of domain1.com and domain2.com
 So, I can set the local host file on a network attached PC to point domain1.com &amp; domain2.com to 192.168.1.51 and perform some testing.
 Is it possible to pull domain1.com and domain2.com by IP on 192.168.1.51 without editing the local hosts file? If I simply browse to 192.168.1.51 at this point, I would just receive a welcome to IIS page or whatever.

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin I am curious what everyone’s take is on keeping certifications active? I think certifications are great when trying to learn new technologies especially when you may not have real world experience but want to broaden your knowledge. However, I believe real world experience goes a lot further with future employers than just have a cert alone. So I am curious, if you hold a cert in a given area and have years of real world experience in that area, do you try to keep your certs active or focus on learning new things and moving on to other certs? I am a network engineer with 7 years in the field. I currently hold my CCNP but it expires in Aug. I am contemplating renewing my cert mainly due to how time consuming it is, when I could be working on broadening my knowledge base with say a cloud cert or some other technology. Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin,
 we finally got approved budget for testing for our fairly new department and would really like to create a test environment so we don&#x27;t have test things in production and pray to god.
 At the end of the month there are going to be 8 members that need to have a place to test thing out before we do any changes to production/show new solutions to our clients. This is going to be totally separate tenant.
 We need to be able to replicate real world scenarios ranging from O365 (apps, sec), Exchange, hybrid AD / AAD, Power Apps to Intune, Windows devices, Security, Compliance etc. so we are ready to offer the solutions with them.
 I&#x27;ve got couple of ways in mind on how to do this but I would like to know how did you guys approach this; 
 - Did you just copy/paste tenant settings from the production environment?
 - Do I just purchase 8 E5 licences or its mostly E3s and couple of E5s for edge cases?
 - Or do we just purchase licences for the generated test users that we are testing things on and admin accounts stays unlicences / have plain O365 E1 for email?
 - How many test users you have in directory?
 - Is everyone global admin or you select few global admins and rest have their own individual permissions?
 - For computers do you use VMs or just couple of old laptops?
 Any tips are appreciated. Would really like to make this right for our team. Thank you.

                              <span>Now that we’ve moved most of our services to the cloud, historic sysadmin roles in my organization are experiencing a bit of an identity crisis. It seems like the overlords are unsure where we fit into the business model, and I’m struggling to define it myself. I recognize we have a growing need for Data and Business Analysts, and for PMs from time to time. I’m in a large international org, 10k plus users split across multiple domains. 
 I’m curious what others have experienced once the bulk of the operations have been outsourced. Do you find yourselves in a simple break/fix role, or did your org just reduce headcount?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I found an old P330i in a thrift store that still works but needs a firmware update. I tired creating an account on the Zebra site but it was asking for license/account codes. I understand the need for this for current models but since this one has been officially discontinued for years now, I was wondering if there was any other way to get firmware for discontinued products.
 TIA

                              <span>Hey guys,
 We are getting a DNS issue that we have never faced before.
 We host a domain with our own nameservers. Our domain has this zone (zone.example.com) in which we created a CNAME record (www.zone.example.com) and pointed it to a CloudFront website (a123455789.cloudfront.com).
 This website only works in some world regions because for some reason the nameservers of zone.example.com in those regions changed to the AWS CloudFront website NSs. As such the clients can no longer resolve the address.
 Every CNAME we create point to that CloudFront website gets this behaviour. I am very new to DNS but our partners are also unable to explain it...
 What am I missing? Really confused here.
 Thank you!

 That said, the market for 3rd party solutions doesn&#x27;t exactly scream out at me, so I make this post humbly asking to be pointed in the direction of solutions that you think are good and that you didn&#x27;t have to dedicate a SOE guy full time to maintain.

                              <span>I have been troubleshooting issues related to intermittent packet loss on my Comcast EDI circuit. To test this I have been running ping plotter on a machine directly hooked up to my WAN switch. When the packet loss happens the route in the Carrier network changes to 1 or more different routes until it returns back to the route that I have had previously. So far the longest packet loss that this has caused lasted 3 seconds. This has been observed multiple time in an hour during business hours.I have to wait until Monday to hear back from my assigned engineer.
 For those working at carriers is my observation correct, or is there something that I could be missing?

                              <span>Hi all
 I was wondering if anybody had any useful tools to visualise / document network address space usage.
 We use a /16 network address which is subnetted by environment then subnetted again, and again….
 This address space usage is currently documented in a table and although accurate, it isn’t the most “accessible” documentation.
 I was wondering if anybody had any tools / tips for improving the format of this documentation to show more clearly the “hierarchical” structure of the network, the size of the subnets and the unused address space we have.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have a question about point to point vs multipoint networks (hub and spoke).
 I work in a school district which is very high density. Multiple sites connected over a Metro E connection. Would a hub and spoke or a point to point be better for this application. I would think a hub and spoke would be best due to limiting the broadcast seen by other switches. To give you an idea of my network, on a daily basis I sit at roughly 14,000 devices. I think a hub and spoke is the way to go due to limiting traffic on the incoming interfaces to what is destined to that router. The switches all share the same native vlan 300 (no IPs exist). Each individual site and the shared core have a unique vlan (vlan 30x) with their own /30 between the two. 
 Even though they all share the same metro e, am I correct in saying a hub and spoke separated by vlans (30x) would be better then all of the sites sharing the same vlan (300)? The sites really dont have a reason to communicate between each other. Traffic mostly goes between the site and the core, then out to the internet. 
 Thank you for your help.

                              <span>As a beginner to networking cables, I learned that people often confuse the RJ45 and 8P8C connectors and use the terms interchangeably. According to an image from Wikipedia, the RJ45 connectors have an extra tab or keyed space. Based on this information, I am guessing that my laptop uses an 8P8C connector for ethernet connectivity because I don&#x27;t see a keyed or tab space in the port. However, I could be mistaken about this. Can anyone confirm which type of connector my laptop uses for ethernet connectivity? Additionally, I am wondering where these two types of connectors are typically used.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a site that has been a problem child for me since I&#x27;ve started working my current position. I noticed a decent chunk of packet loss, but it&#x27;s in the middle of a canyon and the only connection we are able to get at the moment is LTE.
 In the past I had written this off as a bad connection due to LTE and haven&#x27;t looked into it a ton, but after monitoring the LTE modem I didn&#x27;t see a ton of packet loss to it. I figured no problem, they get a ton of power outages, and don&#x27;t have a generator.
 Their router is likely fried. Since it&#x27;s the middle of the winter I held off on driving to the site until I had a free day to tackle it. I replaced the router and tested and everything seemed fine, but after a few days I started seeing heavy packet loss again.
 Looking at the logs I&#x27;m seeing that it&#x27;s giving ESP errors and all of my phase 2 tunnels are constantly going up and down. I&#x27;ve verified that all algorithms match up perfectly along with DH and autokey time. The VPN profile is a carbon copy of all of my other sites but this is the only one that has any issue.
 My setup from the branch to the data center is Fortigate (Station FW) -&gt; Cradle point Modem (LTE) -&gt; Palo Alto (Data center FW). My ping times vary between 100-500ms and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar whether doing passthrough with a cradlepoint or with high latency causing the tunnel to constantly crash. Or if there are any pointers on what else I can try.

 I often participate in online discussions related to computer networking and datacenters. And of course there I like to share my own experiences about those topics there. However/ a bit of background information, about me, I live and work in the balkans. Some naysayers would say central europe, but &#x27;ex-Yugoslavia&#x27; might be a better term. However for practicality I will call it &#x27;the balkans&#x27; as for the purposes of this post I don&#x27;t want to be confused with Germany or Switzerland.
 Let&#x27;s get back on topic. I like to talk online about my experiences in computer networking and datacenters online. However, all my experiences have been on the Balkan. When I hear the word datacenter, my first thought are the three local public datacenters I often visit and the local state run IX.

                              <span>I help out periodically with some former contacts and I had one approach me to help find a VPN solution that they can roll out to take that load off their firewall. Currently all SSL mobile clients authenticate against the internal user database of their firewall, which also deals with the user certificates. Their rate of growth has made this a bit of a pain to manage needless to say and almost impossible to monitor and audit.
 They are going to replace the firewall (already have the new one) and found they can&#x27;t simply migrate the users, so we are on the hunt to find something more manageable and fluid. If they have to reconfigure each client, may as well move forward rather than sideways. Authentication against on prem AD is a must, 2FA is a bonus. 
 Cisco? Palo Alto? Fortigate? Full disclosure- I have been out of this game for a few years now (after 20 years in the trenches) and I haven&#x27;t really followed too closely. Looking for ideas and places to start digging. It seems most want/ require you to change your firewalls out for theirs. This isn&#x27;t really an option nor is it desired. To be honest being able to host something on a VM would be the best option, but even a dedicated appliance is way better than what they have currently.
 ​
 About 50-60 mobile clients, mostly RDP connections- that&#x27;s really about it.

 It is not changing for some reason. Does anyone have any idea why this is happening?

                              <span>For the past 5 years we been dealing with terrible internet access from Spectrum Business. A week does not goes by with out us having to reset our cable modem or/and deal with a couple minutes outages, sometimes even hours. We are subscribed to the 600/35 plan. I have always wanted more upload speeds so we started looking for a fiber connection.
 After contacting 3 ISP I narrow it down to two companies. One is offering 1gbps symmetrical from one of their nearby PON for $489 no SLA, this connection is not dedicated, but the sales person claims that the PON is not currently being used by any other company and this has been the case for years, he even claimed (and I actually believed this) this should remain the case since the types of businesses in my street are not the type to required these speeds or reliability. The second company is able to provide a dedicated fiber line to their datacenter, after weeks of negotiation I was able to get them to come down to $730 a month for 1gbps with a 99.999% SLA. Both connections requires a 48 months agreement. Honestly we dont need this level of connection but we could really use the upload speeds to run our own cloud storage solution (nextcloud, plex, databackup services) and couple other things. in reality a 100x100mbps connection is sufficient but the price at that point wouldn&#x27;t be substantially lower since they need to recover their construction cost.
 My question is, under these circumstances would you pay $241 more to have the dedicated connection with a SLA and guaranteed speeds, latency and data packet loss? or should I just save the money and go with the cheaper solution. Thanks for your opinions.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I hope I&#x27;m in the right spot. I&#x27;ve purchased 6x Firepower 2110s and reimaged them with ASA v9.18(2). I&#x27;m attempting to install the Cisco Firepower 2100 Strong Encryption (3DES/AES) license. However, I&#x27;m failing at registering the device with our smart account.
 I&#x27;ve confirmed that the encryption license does show in our inventory. I&#x27;ve been following along with the official Cisco documentation found at:
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa913/configuration/general/asa-913-general-config/intro-license-smart.html#id_57012
 After creating the registration token and running the command:
 license smart register idtoken
 I see in my account the token has been used once, but the device is failing to register. Here&#x27;s some output from &#x27;sh lic status&#x27;:
 Registration:

 Export-Controlled Functionality: NOT ALLOWED

                              <span>God I hate Cisco. I&#x27;m a CCNP but god they are the worst the past few years.
 Configured a new ASA 1010 and shipped it to a branch across the country to replace a dead 5505. Of course with the 1010&#x27;s, Cisco must assume all of their customers manage a single, local branch, because they don&#x27;t let you use crypto commands until you register with the Smart portal to unlock strong encryption (you know, that thing that was preloaded on all the 5500 series firewalls since the PIX&#x27;s went EOL???). So that means I have to wait until the site connects it to the WAN cable to get internet before I can register it and unlock VPN commands, which the business won&#x27;t run without. Even worse is when it needs to go to a country in another timezone. On the 5506&#x27;s I used to be able to just preconfigure the VPN, ship it and tell the on site guy to move the cables over when he starts his day in his timezone and all will work. No no. Now Cisco wants me to wake up at 2am (8am for the site the ASA is getting installed at) so I can register with them, and THEN...only then will they let me register and be granted permission to unlock crypto commands. Scum.
 Today this scenario happened for me, but the Smart Portal is spitting traceback errors at me, and as a result, I can&#x27;t view my inventory or create new license tokens, which means I can&#x27;t register the 1010 to be able to put the VPN&#x27;s up, and had to roll everything back. 
 Come on Cisco. Your ASA customers are NOT Fisher Price engineers managing one location, and nobody that buys an ASA is doing so for their home. Yet you insist on making things easier for residential and mom/pop shop operations and harder for enterprise/commercial grade large multi-location international companies with every new generation of hardware.

                              <span>I have been going through the logs on wireshark, the dns server and router and I am at a loss. I do not have anyone else that I can lean on for this problem at my company. 
 I have noticed that going to Apple.com that the page loads up just fine. I can go to any of the pages except for one. When I go to the store tab or click on buy it shows as &quot;The page you&#x27;re looking for can&#x27;t be found.&quot; for some reason. It is still apples website and not a 404. I can click on other parts of the page and it will take me to where ever. But only the shop page does not work. I have flushed DNS on client and DNS server, history, cookies etc. Maybe there is something else that I am missing? I used different browsers. This is not just a single computer specific problem either. It does not matter what device I am on.
 Currently studying for my CCNA. This would be a great problem to learn from.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;m having an issue I&#x27;ve never encountered, and I&#x27;d like to get some insight as I&#x27;ve scoured the internet for days. It takes some work to explain. 
 For context, I took over at my location about nine months ago. We recently had a scheduled power outage at our location. Our primary devices were on generators to prevent them from shutting down. Other devices around the location did get powered off. 
 Our core switch is a Ruckus ICX7650-48F. After power was restored, I cannot ssh into any Cisco switch directly connected to the core. Any HP/Aruba device directly connected works with SSH and ping. The same is true for any cisco device downstream from an HP/Aruba. 
 Although this is happening, everything around the site is running fine from an operational standpoint. We have wireless and all ethernet working. 
 We have a Cisco 3650 directly below the core in the rack that I&#x27;ve been troubleshooting. When I checked spanning-tree on it, I noticed a VLAN ID mismatch with two different VLANs. Our management VLAN and the Trunk VLAN. Nothing has changed in the configuration, and I&#x27;ve double checked that there isn&#x27;t a mismatch like it says. I get this error with all Cisco switches. 
 I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of troubleshooting and need more ideas. If you need more information, I will make sure to send that to you by PM. 
 Thank you!!
 TLDR: Scheduled power outage, and the management VLAN doesn&#x27;t work on Cisco devices.

                              <span>We have a school network currently running on a Cisco ASA 5516-X connected to a 9200L acting as a core switch, with VLAN information being sent from the core switch to the access switches via VTP. 
 We are demoing a Palo Alto firewall and I&#x27;m interested in getting visibility into our intra-network routing to the firewall, and putting up some blocks in place. For instance, only our Faculty/Staff users need access to the printers and projectors VLAN, but guest wifi users don&#x27;t.
 Is that the right move? And if I do that, what is the process of moving the VLANs up to the firewall? I&#x27;ve been reading over this thread on the Cisco forums and it sounds like our path, but If I delete the VLANs off of the core, VTP will wipe out the VLANs on the access level switches

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently setting up a VXLAN connection between 2 sites. The sites are connected using redundant 10Gbps infrastructure, there are some routers (2 or 3, depending on the connection) in between. Unfortunately I cannot change these connections and the MTU I get at each end is 1500 .
 I&#x27;ve setup a linux machine on each side, created a VXLAN connection in between, connected an additional network adapter to the network of the site and bridged the vxlan interface.
 FRR distributes the needed information using BGP evpn.
 I can ping from left to right without problems, iperf testing using UDP gets me to a little over 1Gbps (less than expected, but OK for now). However, iperf testing using TCP gets me 10Mbps at max.
 Is this purely the path MTU that is messing with the TCP connections?
 Is there a way to get TCP faster in this scenario or should we just ditch it and look for other options?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I was hoping to get some input for the current situation we are facing.
 We are in the process of relocating to a new office building, which will include a network setup build from the ground up. We currently have around 200 employees and are expecting to grow within 2 years to around 500-600 employees. 
 We currently use Ubiquiti for our AP&#x27;s, switches and firewall. I have read online that Ubiquiti is fine for home and small office environments, but not so much for anything beyond that. This is also something that was confirmed by our IT partner that will be installing the network equipment in our new office. They suggest using Extreme AP&#x27;s in conjuction with Aruba switches and firewall.
 I was wondering what everybody&#x27;s take on this is ? Is it indeed a good idea to switch to Aruba/Extreme, or should we stay with Ubiquiti?

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 I&#x27;m currently starting my own small firm, for that i have alot of customers which want hosting service.
 I&#x27;m want to have my own servers and everything even the upfront cost is more.
 The only really thing i&#x27;m struggling with is finding some network switches, that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. 
 Anyone have a good idea for a SFP+ switch that can be used for storage, have used Lenovo and Aruba switches for this before, from my old company, but budget is tight. Refurbished is fine for me. 
 Also i also need a layer 3 switch for management network and 1GB ethernet equipment that need to be connected. 
 ​
 Look forward to hear some good advice

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 We have an IPsec VPN connection for a client which worked fine, however client installed a firewall (cisco firepower 1120) and since the install, we cannot reach the other end. The VPN tunnel is created but we cannot reach the other side of the firewall. And I cannot see any traffic hitting the firewall. The client router is a Four-Faith F3424 and the VPN server Router is a dreytek vigor2920. The client router is in &quot;gateway&quot; mode, and in the network settings the gateway IP is the outside interface of the firewall. We have acl and nat set up to allow the client router port to inside. I can ping the client router from the server router and PC, but not the firewall. I tried trace route, but when I try to reach the other side of the firewall it looks like it does not go through the VPN tunnel. And I cannot ping the outside Interface of the firewall, however ping is allowed for testing. I upload a logical diagram, we would like to RDP from PC-A to PC-B. When I RDP i just enter 192.168.1.6 and it worked before the firewall, now the other side of the tunnel is on another subnet 192.168.50.0 Any suggestions? Should I switch the client router to router mode and create a static route? Why can&#x27;t I see traffic on the firewall? .

                              <span>Topic - I&#x27;m curious for those who manage peripherals if you are doing anything to manage user&#x27;s monitor configurations. Particularly in unassigned seating locations where users might sit at a different seat each day.
 I know some DisplayLink docks support hot desking. Does anyone have experience with that?
 Any other options?
 ​
 To some degree, I wonder if this is a lose-lose battle since users have different needs (resolution, scaling, etc.) and then on top of that if you can provision display configurations how does it know which monitor is which?

                              <span>I love troubleshooting and resolving issues. Big or small, new or old it doesn’t matter I love a good problem. But now I have a few people report to me and I can already see the trend. 
 They bring me an issue and I solve it! 
 This of course isn’t going to work long term. I need them to resolve issues. 
 I ask questions, but they are typically issue related and tend to lead to a resolution not to the team asking better questions. Any suggestion for switching from troubleshooting issues to troubleshooting troubleshooters?

                              <span>I have been reading about wireguard and it seems to be very promising on the performance side. What is bothering me is that unlike other VPN tunnels where its un/pw authentication based, here you need to configure the public key of each device, meaning you´d have to contact each user one by one to obtain their public key. Isn´t this a big hassle? Has any of you implemented this?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Myself and my coworkers are tearing our hair out with a Windows update issue. 
 As background: 
 We have a mix of Windows 10 &amp; 11 devices (close to 50/50). Each year, we refresh approximately a quarter of devices. Our 2020, 2021, and 2022 devices are Dell, with our remaining 2019 devices being HP, a mix of laptops and mini desktops.
 We work closely with an MSP who manages our Windows updates/patching through the RMM they provide. Reboots are forced on Thursday evenings for updates to install.
 The problem:
 Today (1/6), several users reported their computers unable to boot. All of these users were on our 2019 HP Mini Desktops and Windows 10- model is HP EliteDesk 800G4M. The HP SureStart logo appears briefly (2 seconds or so) before the machine power cycles itself.

                              <span>I was just wondering about people&#x27;s experiences working as IT in the healthcare field. I have a friend who is currently working as head of IT at a privately owned company who was offered a position as a project manager at a large hospital chain. He is worried that it may be a more corporate structure that everyone hates b/c everyone is just a number in that sense.

                              <span>Week one post Christmas and I’m drained…… 
 We were hit on the at the end of December. We don’t have an IT department any more (we are a satellite office albeit a large one), so I’ve become Mr. IT for the time being. (I’m not a novice by any means and it’s not that far from my real job, but I’m certainly not the IT guy or Sys Admin!)
 Parent office dealing with the “proper stuff” (legal, dealing with the “hackers” etc) but I’m trying to restore order to the place, bring functionality back. 
 Obviously now is the time I’ve realised no one has ever thought about verifying our backups before….. they are a mess! All systems having to be rebuilt from scratch (not a bad thing really…….), but at least some of the important data we needed still exists.
 There’s not really a point to this point apart from a general “what a week” and “screw ransomware groups” (although I have a slight respect for them - It’s very impressive the damage they can do, it’s slightly fascinating!)

                              <span>Can you all recommend a TV for a conference room setup? I am thinking 55-65&quot;. The budget doesn&#x27;t allow for a digital signage or commercial screen. I looked at dumb TVs, and the Sceptres had a lot of bad reviews. So I am hoping to find a consumer TV that will default to the HDMI input, so the users don&#x27;t have to deal with the smart features.
 Edit: This TV will be in a conference room, and only used for showing presentations during meetings. That is why I want the input to stay on HDMI at all times. It won&#x27;t connect to a network at any point. The perfect solution for this is a dumb TV, but since those are either junk or too expensive I can&#x27;t use one.

                              <span>For background I have almost 4 years already being the sysadmin at that main location (also my first IT job). But this new company is taking over, and this new position would have me occasionally driving to 3 other locations, each ~2 hours away on top of overseeing the main site (which is local). I would basically be covering all of So-Cal&#x27;s IT department of this company that has a handful of IT staff across all its US operations. 
 At this point I am considering asking between $70-80k/yr. Does that sound reasonable for the situation I listed above? I can provide more details if needed.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>GCP environment was created by dev team with a bunch of manually created accounts.
 Now we are going back to implement sync with AzureAD
 Does anyone know what the behavior will be if the manual accounts are removed? Will they re-sync based on the AzureAD connector?
 I&#x27;ve gone back through IAM and created groups/roles so some accounts (assuming they re-sync from AzureAD groups) will have permission changes, like going from Owner &gt; Editor. Just not sure if other resources that these users may have created will get caught in the process.
 Looking for the best way to clean this up, since usernames are the same on both sides.
 Production workloads were stood up in GCP before I was even aware of it and not terribly familiar with Google&#x27;s behavior so just being careful.

 I&#x27;m supporting a small doctors office, as their previous msp hasn&#x27;t cared at all. Today I noticed that the only server HDD makes funny noises, so I ran CrystalDiskInfo and EVERY threshold is exceeded. I&#x27;d like to change the drive while it&#x27;s still working, but as I rarely deal with hardware and I can&#x27;t trust the backups, I&#x27;m quite nervous.
 I shut the server down and buy a hard drive tomorow. After that I&#x27;ll connect the drive and make a 1:1 copy with clonezilla. 
 Is it just that easy or did I miss something?

Users had an option to either download an app or to request a physical hardware token to authenticate themselves when logging into their windows account. After much training and 1 on 1, it seemed to be a great security solution, or so I thought. But no matter what the solution, stupidity always finds a way.
 I was assisting a new user at the information desk for an unrelated issue at the time when I stumbled upon a different users credentials nicely written on a sticky note, laminated and taped down in plain sight right on the desk next to the keyboard for all users &amp; even some customers to see.

 I figure I would touch on something that many other people could relate to. 
 ​
 I DON&#x27;T understand why but, Why is it that when someone asks for help in the IT world on reddit, SO many people seem to just comment with anything BUT the actual help needed. If you cant help maybe just move on to something else?
 It may be a different weird type of nerdy &#x27;cockyness&#x27; but god, why can&#x27;t people just be courteous?
 Why waste your and my time just to be useless and put others down?
 Anyways, For those of you who are on the opposite end of the spectrum, Thank you :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to the sysadmin world and I&#x27;m hoping to get some advice from the more experienced folks. I currently work at an MSP and we have a rotating monthly oncall schedule. I missed a call that came in at 2:00 am; my cell is right on my nightstand, it did indeed ring at max volume, but I just slept through it.
 Management is very upset I missed the call but I honestly don&#x27;t know how to move forward with this. I don&#x27;t know what steps I can take to prevent this from happening again if I don&#x27;t have control over whether or not I sleep. 
 For the record I&#x27;m hourly, and do not get compensated for being oncall - only when work is being done am I paid.

 I took a contract job, the person before me was let go and destroyed alot of documents. So I have nothing to follow.
 The wifi is having issues connecting devices. The AP are not controlled by the cisco meraki and dose not show as a device or on any network scan. My question is what is the best way to access these ap to troubleshoot?

                              <span>Hello,
 at large sites, I usually use network access control solutions from Extreme or Cisco, for example to block individual ports on switches or to prohibit or allow connections from A to B, depending on the use case. Now if I have smaller environments and want to use only low cost hardware (NETGEAR, D-LINK..) because this location is not so important, what is the best way to do it? Which must be a feature: Foreign MAC addresses are not allowed to come into any network for the time being, until I allow them on the portal. How to implement something like this?

 So yeah, Digital Signage xd everyone fav topic 
 The requirement. 
 40+ Sites, one TV each per site
 Central control over the system
 Limited Control for local site admins 
 Useable by non-tech people/ Stable units.
 POE + WiFi
 Patchable/Upgradable units from the admin Panel 
 I just finished a POC of Airtame, units appear to be ChromeCasts, but they don&#x27;t appear stable for us.
 Their cloud dashboard is clean, but the results when running the playlist weren&#x27;t great.
 Powerpoints looped when in a playlist, for example.

                              <span>Good morning,
 We upgraded 1 of 3 domain controllers from 2008R2 &gt;2012r2 &gt; 2019 about 2 weeks ago. 
 A week later we started having people experience RDP issues that were strange. When connecting by hostname people were sporadically getting invalid credentials. Changing it to IP resolves the issues.
 ​
 Luckily this is only affecting select remote users and of course IT while attempting to connect to servers.
 ​
 Replication seems to be working as intended... any advice is appreciated! Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been chasing down an issue for several months now that first presented itself as the Start Menu not working then Office activation/sign in issues. I&#x27;ve gone far enough to know that it appears to be related to moderns apps being prevented from running. For example, I go into event viewer under Applications and Services / Microsoft / Windows / AppLocker / Packaged app-Deployment I see a ton of errors relating to AAD Broker Plugin, Windows Search, Start Menu experience host. We don&#x27;t have any applocker rules and it&#x27;s only affecting random machines. I can&#x27;t explain the cause but does anyone know the fix? We have about 15,000 machines+ and our service desk gets probably 5-6 calls a day on it. Re-imaging the machine has been our only fix to this point. If I try running powershell scripts to re-register these apps I get an error saying it was blocked by policy. Also to note we are using WSUS/SCCM and block the private store as we use store for business. I have enabled a registry key to allow for automatic downloads of store apps.

                              <span>Total cloud n00b here:
 It seems there are a lot of approaches (Azure Migrate service, Azure Disaster Recovery, etc).
 But none of them is explained clearly in the Azure docs.
 So, I can make an AMI from that AWS EC2 instance and store it in AWS S3.
 And then I can copy that AMI file to Azure Storage.
 But what do I do after that? 
 My goal is to duplicate that VM on Azure, I&#x27;ll still keep the one on AWS. And there is no data getting updated in real -time.
 So, there is no concern regarding downtime or replication or anything like that.

                              <span>We&#x27;re an MSP. One of our clients has 11 main sites, with a few satellites at a few of the main sites. Most of the main sites have WatchGuard Fireboxes. We were tasked with whitelisting two fairly large CIDR blocks (a /20 and a /23.) It&#x27;s easy to do in WatchGuards, in &quot;Blocked Site Exceptions,&quot; where you can choose an IPv4 network. But, one main site has a cheap Linksys or Netgear. (I can&#x27;t remember the brand. But, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s one of the two.) 
 That site is pushing back on cost and wants to know what the cheapest firewall is that can whitelist CIDR blocks of IPs. I don&#x27;t think stuff off the shelf at retail shops can do it. Any ideas? Since we&#x27;re a MSP, we&#x27;ve switched to the new leasing monthly choice for firewalls. (I don&#x27;t like the new model, personally. But, I&#x27;m a team player.). It doesn&#x27;t even have to be real cheap, but rather a pay once and you own it. But, they do want the cheapest that can do this.
 This is for a PCI scan to occur from a 3rd party PCI compliance scanning company.
 Also, is whitelisting essentially making an allow any statement for ports 1-65535?

                              <span>Hello again brothers and sisters,
 Just wanted to ask a more career-based question for you all. Work for a company that supports about 450 users, some with assets but mostly just M365 accounts. I have 7 Months of professional experience so far in IT. I am tech savvy and in my personal life built computers and always had a basic understanding of how electronics work. Though I am very inexperienced and a noob I still, however, am responsible for 3 networks and their safeguarding and troubleshooting.
 I am the most senior IT person in the company because I am the only IT person in the company except for the new hire who is more hardware focused. I know I have a long way to go experience wise but I am working toward a master&#x27;s in computer security management followed by Sec+ and Net+. The title at the moment is basically help desk but with the responsibility of a systems administrator, network engineer, and Azure cloud engineer.
 CEO asked me to start thinking about what my next title should be but I don&#x27;t even know what I want to do in this field. I love IT, love making something work after multiple failed attempts, and the rush of self-accomplishment when the problem is solved. I like working in Azure and Intune, have not tried my hand at coding or scrips because I am not confident in my ability to not blow everything up in the process.
 What I am asking for is just some insight on what a solid next step title would be from helpdesk. I eventually want to become a CISO in the next 8-10 years but just unsure of how to get there. Unsure of what path to take because I want to do what is best for me and also have mouths to feed at home.
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Work on a Service desk, been there for 8 Months, 
 ​
 was happy with my wage when started however since firstly Its clear I am doing miles beyond most of the colleauges + knowledge I bring and also the NEW wage there offering new starters I feel I deserve a payrise.
 I asked my manager for a payrise and they wasn&#x27;t able to get it.
 its coming around to the yearly review in march for payrises in the traditional sense but thats still months away.
 I personally feel deflated and have lost all motivation to go above and beyond when my colleagues doing much less are on the same money and new joiners with no knowledge can be on more.
 I personally do not want to leave in the next 6 months atleast due to happy with arrangement of working whilst I get to see my baby at home.
 ​
 Do I do the following
 Tell my manager I feel demotivated due to this.
 Do nothing and do less work
 Do above and beyond on the hope of raise in 3 months.
 ​
 ​
 I personally feel like - Option 2 and leave in 6 months but wondered peoples thoughts, I work from home so can be doing other stuff in the time I&#x27;m not fully at the machine cracking out tickets

 They&#x27;re also a mix of POE and Non-POE.
 Just trying to gauge the general consensus - would you replace all with POE switches (outside the core) or mix and match as needed?
 Budget not an issue - cost is the cost.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve seen many tools that allow me to mount all shares in my NAS under the same letter, but only when using SFTP or WebDAV. But when it comes to samba, I have not seen that option; I have to assign each share to a single unit/letter. Is that a samba limitation? Or is it just a Windows limitation? If it&#x27;s the latter, how could I overcome that limitation?
 Thank&#x27;s for the help🙏

 ​
 Hey, I&#x27;m not a regular here, but right now I&#x27;m kind of at a loss.
 I never liked using the cloud service to remote manage, but right now they seem to be down for us and I fail to come up with a plan b that doesn&#x27;t involve driving over there and using a port.
 Anyone know if you can grab a token from the cloud site and login directly? The http request to their site seems to include one, so they aren&#x27;t entirely dead I guess.
 thanks, cheers, have a great weekend,
 Mia
 ​
 edit: Solved it, still had a vpn into the networt i could use. Thanks though &lt;3

                              <span>Hello! I am the CEO of a small software house, we have 10 people on staff and the brunt of our work is designing, developing and maintaining B2B and B2C applications for our clients. We are getting to the point where i belive we are going to need a sysadmin. Both for better workflow for maintaining systems and handling security, backups, knowledgebase and support.
 We work with VPS Ubuntu and also cloud hosting and computing with Azure Portal. All our applications are booted inside Docker VMs
 Im interested in asking what you would say is key knowledge and qualities of a good sysadmin. When i hire developers we usually do a programming challenges is there something similar in the sysadmin space?
 What types of questions would you be interested to ask if you where recruiting a sysadmin?
 Thank you for taking the time reading my post. I hope i did not break any rules, to be clear this is not a recruitment post im only looking for insights from this community since i know alot of strong admins lurk in here.

                              <span>We all hate them. But we all have 30GB+ shared mailboxes in our environments that we can&#x27;t eliminate. Or worse shared user mailboxes that are even larger.
 I&#x27;ve done what I can with retention policies and online archiving to reduce the size as much as possible but the performance in online mode is still appalling as you would expect.
 Cached exchange mode is essential for Exchange Online to fix this imo but what about shared folders, are you enabled &quot;Download shared folders&quot;? Enabling it drastically improves shared mailbox performance but at the cost of huge (20GB+) OST files. You could reduce the amount cached to 6 or 3 months but that affects user mailbox caching as well. How are you all handling this?

 My structure is :
 VLAN1000 : (10.40.60.0/26)
 ​
 we have 2 forest like below.
 ​
 1- Domain Controller / DNS - domain name : contoso.com 
 ​
 1- Domain Controller / DNS - domain name : companyB.com
 Also , I will define VLAN1000 : (10.40.60.0/26) inside AD Sites and Services for both domain.
 My question is : if I put two domain controller (different domain name) same VLAN , will I have any problems?
 thanks,

OEM because it&#x27;s generally a guarantee of receiving basic but reliable and decent hardware.
 Any suggestions where to look? eBay and Gumtree strangely come up with very little.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for a solution to implement a recycle bin for our file server (WS 2022)I&#x27;ve come across this software, but I&#x27;m not sure I can trust the code at all. There&#x27;s unprofessional/incorrect English on website, change log, and license ..https://networkrecyclebin.info/index.html
 and &quot;main&quot; website: https://1securitycenter.com/index.html
 What you guys think?Do you have another solution in mind otherwise?

                              <span>Hi,
 So we are running a kind of hybrid environment still. Users are created in On-Prem and synced to Azure, Servers are in on-prem and workstations are in AzureAD and managed by Intune.
  
 Currently our minimum password age is at 1 day as per CIS18 1.1.3. But this is causing such a headache.
  
 If a password is reset through Azure AD, like if a supporter resets a passwords and gives to a user. They are not able to change it for 24 hours, since our on-prem AD will not see it as a password set by an administrator.
 Even worse is if the &quot;Force user to change password on next login&quot; is set. Then the user is asked to change their password when they log in, but they are not able to do so, since their password is not more than 24 hours old.
  
 Is there any way around this? I was hoping the minimum password age could be something more reasonable, like 15 minutes or even 30. But 24 hours is just causing such a pain in the ass for support and for the users.

                              <span>After what happened with LastPass recently and the fact that i must migrate an entire site from lastpass to another solution (prob Keepass) i was wondering if any of you use a self hosted password manager. I really like the idea if having complete control on the storage of the company passwords. The best would be to be to share some folders between users, using the ad sso for login etc… (With keepass, you do not control what passwords are shared between users) Any suggestions would really be appreciated

                              <span>I started on Tuesday importing a 12c database to 19c due to the application that uses it was being upgraded. Today I finally finished the application upgrade! I have a long background in Sys/Network Admin but with this new job as an Applications Manager I&#x27;ve started to learn a lot of DBA skills on the fly. Getting ready for bed I thought &quot;Did I enable archive mode after importing the dump file?&quot;. So my anxiety got the best of me. I went to go check and sure enough archive mode was not enabled. So I ran &#x27;shutdown immediate&#x27; (which hung for a bit and I thought I was screwed) and then started it up and enabled archive mode. Made some changes in the application and everything appears to be working. Whew! To you experienced DBAs, what would have been the downside to leaving archive mode off? Also, is it worth using RMAN for a 20GB database? The application vendor&#x27;s DBA helped enable it last year when we moved from on-prem to Azure, but I have no idea how to use it if something went wrong. My plan is to use a BAT script to create a dump file every night in conjunction with Corporate&#x27;s nightly backups.

                              <span>I bumped into an old classmate over my holiday break, he was the lucky one to land a job on the provincial IT team due to &quot;family in the union.&quot; 
 I tell him about my hard times being stranded on a project, due to the Junior Tech quitting at the last moment ( he was denied a 24 month leave, having only been with the company 4 months), so I&#x27;ve been juggling being a sysadmin, tech and a PM at a massive hotel all by myself.
 He tells me, he has spent the last 3 months going to every morgue, pathology room, and office of the coroner. He has had to replace computers while they were doing active &quot;projects&quot; or moving people around. Since he has to drive to and from these sites, he has to bring back the &quot;deceased&quot; with him and says no matter how many cans of air fresheners, he cannot get the smell out of his work van.

                              <span>Been on this sub for many years and I would generally think, &quot;There&#x27;s no way a company can operate like this&quot; and now I&#x27;m in a situation where I&#x27;m looking at our IT guys and started to wonder how this could have happened.
 We are a small company and had an absolutely fantastic small team of people doing some kickass work! As the company started to grow, we made some wise decisions to hire people and also some tech to go with(which is usually rare as seen in this sub). Now, as part of this transition, we moved a bunch of us to the security side and some to IT and then hired for both teams. The company is great overall and considering the culture has worked very well for the last few years, management decided to hire based on some high-level interviews. Even for deeply technical roles, it wa…</span>

How do you decide which of the hundreds of proficiencies you have are important enough to include on your resume? DHCP, VLANs, AD, DNS, VOIP, NPS, BCDR, SNMP, Exchange, etc, etc, etc...
 I work for an MSP, so my scope of knowledge has been very wide. I know I will want to edit it to cater more specifically to each job I apply to, but I do want to have a general resume uploaded to Indeed. Any recommendations?

                              <span>Inspired by the recent post of bombing an interview, for about a thread for the opposite? Mine just happened a couple of weeks ago. I had an overzealous recruiter (in a good way) that checked on me prior to the interview, and promised to call after. Anyhow, the interview is going ok from my standpoint. The questions are really focused on one particular area of expertise, not my strongest but I keep my resume honest and spoke to my knowledge in the area. About 40 minutes inI notice a call from the recruiter come through which of course I send to voice mail. The interview was originally scheduled for a half hour (lol) so I figured she was just being eager to follow up. Anyhow it wraps up about 15 minutes later and I call the recruiter back. She asks me how I thought it went. I said so-so, it wasn&#x27;t my best interview, but it wasn&#x27;t a bad one. 
 It turns out that she was calling because mid-interview the interviewer had messaged the recruiter to go ahead and prepare an offer letter. I&#x27;ve got to say that&#x27;s the first time I received an offer before finishing an interview.
 So, what&#x27;s your interview that you absolutely nailed?

                              <span>Goodbye silly contracts saying you can&#x27;t use your skills in the free market
 ​
 About one in five American workers—approximately 30 million people—are bound by a non-compete clause and are thus restricted from pursuing better employment opportunities. A non-compete clause is a contractual term between an employer and a worker that blocks the worker from working for a competing employer, or starting a competing business, typically within a certain geographic area and period of time after the worker’s employment ends. Because non-compete clauses prevent workers from leaving jobs and decrease competition for workers, they lower wages for both workers who are subject to them as well as workers who are not. Non-compete clauses also prevent new businesses from forming, stifling entrepreneurship,…</span>

 I work abroad (Middle East) as one of the many expats for a company and have been for over the last year. Before I accepted the contract, I agreed to have the remote possibility in my contract as I have always worked remote previously. As I was coming over here as an expat, I understood that FT remote was not going to be an option, but we agreed upon (with HR/my boss) at the time that as long as I came into the office 2 days a week, they were fine with me working remote the other 3 days.
 Things have changed a lot within the company over the last year, as the company has hired more and more people. This has made our office space even more difficult to work in as most of the c…</span>

 I implemented Patch Manager Plus ~ a year ago in our environment handling ~10k unique devices and have been sorely displeased with it.
 Patches have failed to deploy in the environment via automated scheduling, with the majority of systems refusing to even attempt to patch during the patch windows that we are constrained to because of manufacturing disruptions. 
 Performing a manual deployment of patches to the same groups of systems results in a 70+% success rate across the board, with the other 30% mostly being successes flagged as failures (one patch out of five failed for some reason...)

                              <span>It&#x27;s been ~ 2 weeks since LastPass&#x27;s 2nd breach disclosure(merely 21 days apart from the 1st - 30th November) hit mainstream news.
 Some things to note:
  
Your vault isn&#x27;t in plaintext. URLs are in Base64 &amp; HEX but passwords ARE NOT. You can confirm this from Mr. Gibson&#x27;s show notes. They have directions to obtain your vault/blob via a browser - https://www.grc.com/sn/SN-904-Notes.pdf
 LastPass&#x27;s offsite cloud backup data was exfiltrated. The offsite backup includes backups from their on-premises servers and regional data(required for regions with regulatory reasons)
 You should check your master password iteration counts. If it&#x27;s 5,000 and you have a short(most likely 8 character password) you might be in pickle. Steve&#x27;s also explained this and the history of how it came to be in the show notes. Change your master pass immediately to a longer one *and also passwords for individual sites*. Also up the iterations to 350,000.
 If you&#x27;re an old(started using it circa 2008 - LastPass&#x27;s start) LastPass user your vault might be a mixture of passwords in CBC &amp; ECB mode. It seems LastPass has left passwords created in CBC &quot;as is&quot; when they realized and shifted to *ECB*.
  
They&#x27;ve made mistakes along the way like having several data breaches. Some are forgivable and can be given a pass. But I do agree with Steve that they should have *automatically &quot;upped&quot; the iterations on Password Based Key Derivation Functions(PBKDF2) for all clients*, Pestered people to shift to longer master passwords on client UIs and lastly, shifted those old passwords from CBC to ECB.

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;ve been the main IT guy for the same company for a long time, and I finally got in gear and found a new position. I&#x27;m focusing now on what I can do to set up my current company for success after I&#x27;m gone.
 What do you guys think would be some of the most useful things to do in this situation would be? What do you wish your predecessors would have done before they left?
 For background, there are a couple of junior guys, but there is a pretty good experience and training gap between them and me. There are a number of systems that neither of them has ever touched. We have some documentation, but it&#x27;s pretty basic, mainly just indicating what systems we have, where the backups are, etc.
 I don&#x27;t know whether the company is going to hire a replacement, promote a junior guy, or something else.
 Edit: I&#x27;m leaving because a really good opportunity at an interesting place came up, and not because I&#x27;m mad at my current company or anything like that. We are parting on good terms. I have colleagues here that I know well and am on good terms with. I&#x27;ve used some of them as references before, and probably will again.

                              <span>Hey all.
 We use Office 365 at my org.
 We also have SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, configured.
 I&#x27;m analyzing reports using dmarcian and it&#x27;s showing multiple office 365 servers as failing SPF being unaligned.
 I&#x27;ve already verified that none of my SPF records are &gt;&#x3D; 255 characters. (we use several &quot;includes&quot;s).
 We do have spf.protection.outlook.com in there as an include. When I look at the report, there are some servers in the 52.100.0.0/14 block are listed as being unaligned, but they are, in fact, in the record.
 Anyone know WTF could be going on here?
 EDIT: Problem solved. See the answer from /u/lolklolk in the thread. Thanks everyone!

                              <span>In outlook, for some user, this screen:
 Standard signature screen
 has been replaced with a new fantastic coolish new screen:
 https://imgur.com/a/alDF57Q
 Now, we have a problem. First of all, it&#x27;s been replaced only on some of the computers, also in the same Tenant (all have the 2211 version of office, managed updates).
 Second problem... It wants to use Roaming Signatures. THAT feature that MS is trying to implement from july 2021, and it still isn&#x27;t working. And it always breaks the powershell commands to set signatures for the accounts.
 And with this new screen, it&#x27;s not possible to select a local signature as default. Only cloud ones. IF you can select one at all. On some of the computers, everything is grayed out.
 And Cloud synced signatures... sometimes they&#x27;re there. Sometimes an older version is there. Sometimes they&#x27;re not there at all.
 ​
 Here is a temporary &quot;FIX&quot;

 I have never implemented DKIM nor have any prior knowledge on how email security work when it comes to DKIM &amp; DMARC so please bear with my ignorance.
 I recently implemented DMARC, then discovered that all google calendar invites are going into users&#x27; spam folder. I turned it off while I investigate. This article says DKIM must be turned on. I had not set DKIM yet. My question is what could potentially break turning on DKIM? I am not finding any warning online on how this affects email delivery and to prevent chaos.

                              <span>I have a VM that&#x27;s normally between 2,000ms and 5,000ms when it comes to CPU Ready Time. It&#x27;s peaking at over 11,000ms at times. Is this too long? The VM has 12 vCPU provisioned. The host has 12 physical cores with HT.
 There are 8 VMs total. The VM with these ready times has 10 vCPUs provisioned.
 The other VMs are as follows:
 VM1 - 2 vCPU
 VM2 - 2 vCPU
 VM3 - 8 vCPU
 VM4 - 4 vCPU
 VM5 - 1 vCPU
 VM6 - 1 vCPU
 VM7 - 1 vCPU
 I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s over provisioned in total as much as I think there are 2 VMs that have too many vCPUs assigned. Am I wrong in thinking this?

 I&#x27;m curious to see how other departments handle escalations?
 What are your policies, best practices?

                              <span>Hey guys,Traditionally, I would/have never installed 3rd party AV software on a Windows Server installation. I could perhaps understand AV on an outside accessible web-server or something, but for internal servers like LDAP, DNS, DHCP, print services, those type of things, I&#x27;ve never installed any extra or 3rd party anti-virus. These days, Windows Defender (or whatever it&#x27;s called) is pretty great at detecting potentially malicious code/tools, and obviously no end-users are touching these machines.
  
Do any solutions exist that act like an &quot;AV server&quot;? In that, it&#x27;s a server that perhaps runs a nightly scan on a list of machines, so that a 3rd party AV wouldn&#x27;t need to be installed everywhere?
 What do you guys do for AV on servers? 3rd party, or Windows Defender enough? Everywhere I&#x27;ve worked we didn&#x27;t install 3rd party AV on servers. Newest place I work they have Malwarebytes installed on EVERYTHING. They want it replaced with bitdefender and told me to be careful because when they installed Malwarebytes it wreaked havok on the servers, blocking critical services and whatnot. I personally don&#x27;t want to put bitdefender on the servers, rather just for end-devices. If there&#x27;s a good cloud or hosted AV solution that can be run from a central server and not be required to be installed to system, that would be cool.
  
What do yall think?

 We are thinking to outsource our IT since it is very hard to find an employee and I was wondering if you ever happened to do something similar and what kind of documents did you sign. Are there any agreement documents out there that can be used as a templates in such occasions? Are there any culprits that I should be aware of, based on your experience?
 The services of interest are:
 - Networking ( pfsense routers, APs, VPNs, etc)
 - Office365 Administration
 - Support
 - Wiki/Documentation maintenance 
 Any ideas/suggestions are welcome

                              <span>Hey guys (and girls). 
 I&#x27;m currently in adoption of some Security Standards, like ISO 27001 and 27701. And there is always the moment that we need to talk about &quot;employee security training and awareness&quot;. 
 As in most companies, security isn&#x27;t a big priority to the employees here. The rule is &quot;the easier, the better&quot;, and security falls to the bottom. 
 So, I&#x27;m here to ask for some guidance. 
 What are your experiences with Training, Awareness and Education on Security? Both on the perspective of listener and speaker. Which points should I focus? How to make it interesting for the End-Users, and yet, assertive? How to make it work in a non-tedious way?
 And by &quot;Training, Awareness and Education&quot;, I mean e-mails, quick tips on security, blog posts, big presentations, gamifications, surveys...
 Thanks :)

 I have been testing out OMV while waiting on my hardware to come in for a proper server, and thanks to another redditor, I have almost everything set up, but there seems to be an issue connecting remotely. I have a domain name through namecheap, as well as DNS settings through Cloudflare, already set up. I can access my server through &quot;domain.net&quot; or &quot;www.domain.net&quot; locally, but not remotely. 
 This is frustrating me to no end, and I am sure the person helping me is getting frustrated too. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi team,
 ​
 Some help please!!!
 I have been tasked to migrate/consolidate 2 file share server running on Server 2008 to Server 2018. 
 ​
 I have spent some time looking at the Microsoft Storage Migration Service tool, it seems that there are three main tasks to perform 
 1) File Share discovery 2) Copy data from old to new server 3) Final cutover, I notice that the Storage Migration Service tool 
  
doesn&#x27;t seem to support consolidating multiple file servers into one
 doesn&#x27;t seem to allow file share migration in a phrase approach, e.g migrate a smaller number of shares first, test/confirm its all working then move on to the next lot. 
  
Am I missing something here? I start to wonder if the Storage Migration Service is the right tool for the task?
 Any help would be much appreciated. 
 ​
 Thanks,
 Chris

 ​
 The first time that user signs in to OWA (Outlook Web App), he will be asked to set current time zone. Can I globally disabled this step? We are using only one time zone.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m writing you this as a rant about Cisco switches.
 What went down? We established a new kronjob on our switches that basically saves the config every week and pushes it to some remote fileserver as backup. 
 What I did not know up to that point: There&#x27;s a bug in the switches when:
  
C9000 Switches are stacked
 Kron Job with &quot;write&quot; is in the config
  
that causes the switch to crash whenever you want to save the config afterwards.
 &quot;Well that looks like a major oversight and has to be fixed in some point right?&quot; HAHAHAHA
 That bug is known by cisco since May 2019 and there is no fixed version right now. They only tell you to use the EEM instead (wich is a really cool feature ngl)
 To top it all of: There&#x27;s a chance of the master-switch to crash and reboot when you try to get rid of the config line.
 *sigh*
 Hope y&#x27;all had a somewhat chill start in this year. I&#x27;m off fixing/restarting switches in our facility...
 On a positive note: Cisco EEM looks really awesome. Will get into that a bit and see what you can do with that.

We currently have a Zebra ZXP Series 3 and it malfunctions nearly every time we use it. It takes 3 tries on average to get a name tag to print correctly. What do you use? How do you like it?

                              <span>Hi!
 I need to clone a Domain-Joined Windows 2019 server - running an VM on vSphere.
 ​
 My question is:
 Can I just snapshot and clone the VM, or what is the right way to avoid Active Directory problems through a duplicate UID?
 ​
 Is it better to:
 Snapshot -&gt; Convert to Template -&gt; Clone Template -&gt; Rejoin AD?
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

 So i landed a job recently and i was curious about some stuff in this community, it&#x27;s a long list of questions so i won&#x27;t annoy you in one post and each time i&#x27;ll ask a different one in hope that your answers would help me and everyone else reading this
 The only software that am using right now for ticketing is GLPI and i was wondering what you guys are using for that and for other stuff, like can you write a list of softwares and tools and each use for each of them ?
 Thank you in advance :D

The answer on the question was to use strings.exe and gave some examples on what to look for from strings&#x27; output.
 Some examples given are:
  
InstallShield: &quot;This Setup was created with a BETA VERSION of InstallShield Developer&quot;
 Inno Setup: &quot;This installation was built with Inno Setup&quot;
 Wise: &quot; This installation was built with InstallAware: http:// www installaware com &quot;
  
I&#x27;d like to get your inputs on the other tools you know that we can add on this list.
 I&#x27;m currently looking at Winrar uninstall exe but can&#x27;t find any clues on what tool was used to create it, but I know that the install switch is /S. I&#x27;d like to build a process where we can have a good guess on what the silent uninstall string are for most programs that doesn&#x27;t use msiexec to uninstall.

Now, I&#x27;m trying to connect it to our ADFS system so that users can use Yubikey to authenticate when they log in to different services, as an 2FA method. However, I&#x27;m having trouble finding information about how to use Yubikey with ADFS. Has anyone here done this before or know where I can find more information?

 I have found these threads, but the comments do not mention any documentation.

 Or has anyone successfully followed the steps described in this link?

 Has anyone here done this before or can they provide guidance on where to find more information?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I want to remove all the mapped drives for the current user when my users are shutting down or restarting their devices. 
 I did a task scheduler that&#x27;s triggering those actions and did a little cmd file that doing the job. 
 The issue seems to be the account used during the task scheduler. When running with &quot;Builtin\Users&quot; I don&#x27;t have any errors, but it seems that the script is not running correctly. Using my AD account, everything is working well of course as I have local admin rights. 
 Run only when user is logged on is ticked. 
 Run with highest privilegies is ticked.
 Just doing that in my cmd : 
 net use * /delete /y
 reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network\* /f
 In Action tab, I just select my batch file.
 Any idea on how can I solve this issue? 
 Thanks!

 Can someone recommend a solution to simulate domain GPO settings for both users and computers, so that i can check and verify on my own?
 Thanks

 It&#x27;s really strange that, new emails sending to that domain name is NOT blocked, only replies messages are blocked! All messages are just plain text sending from Outlook Web with no attachment at all, what is the logic of filtering all replies messages as SPAM, quarantine and NOT notify sender about this?!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have a centos 8 linux file server that is connected to windows ad using sssd/realm. I can confirm I can log into it using windows AD creds.
 Now I want to take a step further and using windows AD groups to give RO/RW permissions on a file share I have mounted on it.
 I have reached a point where network access is there and I can access the share from a windows device and r/W on it. The problem is when I try to configure any sort of group permissions. When I then try to log in the creds input window pops up, I enter creds and I get access denied error.
 Apart from joining the machine to AD using realm, I didn&#x27;t do much other configs outside of smb.conf file, which I will attach here. 
 Config below:

 It has become a pain to work in the LastPass UI (constantly crashing, freezing, etc) 
 Been exploring other options, LastPass enables us to hide passwords from our offshore users and just allow autofill, something important to us for security reasons, are features like this available in BitWarden, does anyone have any experience using BitWarden for an organization at this scale?

                              <span>I was wondering if it was possible to sniff packets over on cellular network, I can&#x27;t find much information online, so I thought I would ask. Now I know it would be difficult, as you don&#x27;t have control over the cell tower like you would over your home or business&#x27;s router, but if you can receive what other phones or cellular capable devices are transmitting couldn&#x27;t you be able read what is in the packets just like you can in a Wi-Fi network, as you are connected to them? Or is a different encryption key used by each device? And as I haven&#x27;t been able to find much online, could someone link some information on the encryption methods used on cellular networks? 
 I have one more thing that needs clearing up about cellular networks. What exactly assigns your IP address, is it something at the cell site, meaning your address changes as you change towers? Or is something else responsible for that? And how is data routed to the cell tower, how does it know that your data is intended for it, does it have it&#x27;s own IP address? If so how does it know in the case of mobile calls and SMS, because as far as I am aware those don&#x27;t travel over the internet? Again if you have any relevant information that you could link it would be greatly appreciated.

Has anyone tried installing some 10gtek 2.5Gbase-T modules in those ports to see if they&#x27;d work? I&#x27;m tempted to buy a couple and test it out, but wondering if anyone else has tried and found that the firmware locks them out or some other shenanigans are going on with the Adtran firmware.
 Something like this one:

                              <span>My understanding with something like Zscaler is that it&#x27;s done by stitching Layer 7 TLS tunnels. There is an App Connector component which functions like a reverse proxy. It sits in front of the application server and establishes outbound connection/tunnel to the Zscaler cloud (Service Edge). On the user&#x27;s device, the client software also creates an outbound tunnel to the Zscaler cloud. The two tunnels are stitched together by the Zscaler Service Edge. For each client-to-app connection, there is a separate micro-tunnel pair.
 I think Azure AD Application Proxy works in similar way except instead of client software it&#x27;s just the client&#x27;s web browser. Basically a client-less version.
 Have I understood this correctly and do all other ZTNA products work the same way?

                              <span>I recently interviewed at a decently large sized college, ~2500 students, for a network engineer position and I was wondering if anyone had any experience working in a similar position? The college has a very large endowment so I&#x27;m kind of excited to work in a department where money isn&#x27;t an issue and everyone has been there for a long time.

                              <span>TL;DR - I need a network of devices (similar to RIPE Atlas) that allows me to ping a server and collect the results. Basically a legal botnet.
 Long Version - Let me apologize beforehand if it is against the rules to post research questions in this sub.
 I am working on a cloud research project, for which I need to be able to ping and traceroute a certain IP address from many different places (about 100) in intervals of 1 and 5 seconds resp. for about 10–20 minutes at a time to monitor the behavior of the network. 
 At the moment, I am trying to use RIPE Atlas to achieve this, but there are a few characteristics of the system that make it not yield utilizable results. For instance, the probes do not execute measurement predictably. They start at some time earlier or later than specified, o…</span>

                              <span>I have a linux host with virtual box running a few VMs, one of which is a vyos router. The router has an adapter configured for 172.16.31.10, and a DHCP service to serve IPs on that address. It is bridged to the host ethernet adapter (set to 172.16.31.9) which goes via a switch to a Ruckus WLC, which is connected to an access point. Currently I can connect to the wireless network provided by the WLC, but my PC does not get an IP address on that network at all. The address for the configuration interface on the WLC is 192.168.10.14. Does this need to be set to the 172.16.31.x subnet, and if so should the gateway be the vyos router address? I can only find articles that explain WLCs from a high level, or in depth configuration guides for specific WLCs that assume an in depth knowledge of networking (which I do not have.. only some basics). My current understanding is that the vyos router should serve up IP addresses via the host (since it is bridged) and then the WLC should &#x27;pass that&#x27; via the access point to my PC. Since it isn&#x27;t working I&#x27;m guessing that is incorrect, but I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge yet to know where to start looking for the issue or how to trace it. Any help/advice is much appreciated.

 I have a collection of tenants.
 I have a collection of VRFs inside those tenants.
 Each VRF corresponds to a security tier.
 Traffic between servers in a single VRF is natively routed/switched in the ACI Fabric.
 Traffic between servers in a different VRF has to go to the firewall and be routed back into the proper VRF. 
 Standard server builds are 9000 byte MTU.
 Standard server builds make use of this MTU because they send a lot of traffic to their storage interfaces and such.

The solution utilizes Palo Alto pre-rules and within them access is either allowed or deny based on AD group membership (or lack thereof). Access to each individual AWS VPC requires membership in the corresponding AD group. 
 Before I get too deep into implementing this over the next several months, I can’t help but feel like this is not very sustainable and that there is a better way to approach this. Any advice?

 Every job listing in networking seems to emphasizes a high level understanding of OSPF,EIGRP, BGP or other routing protocols. While I have labbed these out for certifications I barely ever have to touch them in production environments. I never had to do translations between these protocols and really the only time I needed to touch them is if I am adding a new network which for the most part is pretty basic. I am just wondering if any of you have a similar experience?

                              <span>I have an MPLS connection that I route &#x3D; specific voice traffic over in one of our India offices. I run EIGRP between the MPLS PE and my core so that when the routes go down that traffic is then routed out the default gateway. This works great for when users were in the office but with the shift to remote/hybrid its causing some voice quality issues for remote users.
 Users have been told to use the tunnel all option to force that voice traffic through the VPN and across the MPLS. Obviously tunneling all their traffic is less than ideal and we get a fair amount of complaints about slow downloads and poor voice quality. We do have split-tunneling but that sends that voice traffic out their local gateways and that can be painful as well. We are doing dynamic split-include for some other domains but without the MPLS need on the backend. 
 What I am trying to figure out is if I add this voice domain to that split include will it route it via the MPLS when the routes are present and out through the ASA when the routes are gone (because MPLS is down)? That domain would be tunnel&#x27;d all the time and I simply don&#x27;t know how it will work when the routes are gone?

                              <span>The hand off for the connection is just a single SC port. The fiber guy couldn&#x27;t tell me what kind of transceiver I need. As far as I can tell, I need an SC to LC patch cable and a BiDi SFP transceiver? Can anyone verify if that sounds within the realm of possibility?

                              <span>Hey team!
 We&#x27;re looking at ordering an Aruba CX6100 (JL677A). I need it to do 2 or 3 very basic static routes for a small network with relitlvely little traffic. It says its a L2 switch, but the datasheet (linked below) very specifically says:
 &quot;Static IP routing provides manually configured routes&quot; 
 Aruba CX6100 Switch Series - Datasheet (arubanetworks.com) 
 My VAR, though, is saying that this is a misleading statement in the datasheet, and it&#x27;ll only allow for a single &quot;default-gateway&quot; command and won&#x27;t in fact route traffic, and that we need to step up to a 6200 if we want any basic static IPv4 routing. 
 Does anyone have any direct experience with this model and can weigh in on its capabilities?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve scored a lease on a few larger prefixes that we&#x27;ll be needing for some future expansion. 
 In the meantime, do I need to advertise those blocks if I&#x27;m not using them? 
 Also, something that woke me up at 3am ... is there a point where prefixes get large enough where internet scanners can generate enough load to impact an advertising router in some way? Could this be a concern if I&#x27;m running say a L3 switch as my core router and not a &quot;real&quot; routing frame?

                              <span>Hi, I just installed a VPN at work. It was easy and works fine, but I&#x27;m getting slow speeds, about 40Mbps to the remote NAS and other devices. I know 40Mbps is not that slow, but considering 1Gbps internet connections on both sides, it&#x27;s a bit slow to my taste.
 Is there any way to speed it up?
 I&#x27;m fairly new to VPNs.

                              <span>In other words I could start with a 10.0.0.0/16 and end up with subnets (and VLANS) like
 10.0.2.0/23 (VLAN 2)
 10.0.4.0/23 (VLAN 3)
 10.0.6.0/23 (VLAN 4)
 etc.
 Or I could just do
 10.1.0.0/23 (VLAN 10)
 10.2.0.0/23 (VLAN 20)
 10.3.0.0/23 (VLAN 30)
 The reason for doing it the second way would just be to make the subnet/VLAN pairing more obvious. I would be able to look at any subnet and just know what VLAN it belongs to without having to look it up in a reference spreadsheet or something.
 It&#x27;s a SMB network in a VERY niche manufacturing industry and the company WILL NEVER become very big. It&#x27;s about as big as it will ever get. This is fact. Subnet expansion isn&#x27;t an issue. It will also never expand to other locations. This is purely for compartmentalising interal resources, e.g. servers, phones, laptops, guest wifi, cctv, etc.
 How would you subnet in this scenario?

                              <span>Hope I can explain this properly.
 We have 3 sites (A, B and C) all connected by 1GB/s fibre links terminating on Layer 3 switches, the network consisting of 4 distinct subnets separated on the switches using VLANs (1-4 say) with individual switchports belonging to one VLAN (Access) and the link ports being Trunk ports. All working fine when switch A-B was an old Zyxel but this went pop and we replaced with a Dell (set up identically). After the replacement, one of the VLANs (4) on switch B-C (also Dell) stopped working and after a bit of investigation, we realised Spanning Tree had kicked in and stopped all traffic. As we currently have nothing on VLAN 1 on switch B-C we moved the cables to ports on that and all is now working. 
 I&#x27;ve no idea how to even start to troubleshoot this so any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>So as the title says - I&#x27;m brand new to patching. And I&#x27;m quickly finding this confusing as all hell. A few of our switches are popping on vulnerability scans so I&#x27;ve been tasked with patching them. 2/3 are straight forward 2960x and I was able to find the images easily... However, on our big 4510 switch - I&#x27;m having a hard time. 
 So I guess what I&#x27;m asking is - Is this the correct upgrade?

                              <span>What is your MFA downtime procedure? Lets say you are using Okta for MFA. What is the procedure if Okta goes down? I was presented with this question today and didn&#x27;t have an answer other than wait for them to come back up. We could disable MFA, but that&#x27;s a tremendous risk especially in a time when potential attackers know Okta is down.
 I understand this is a tradeoff of going to SaaS and cloud in general. Kind of like asking what do you do when Exchange Online goes down other than wait. Does anyone have an creative ideas or experience here?

 20 year old me goes for an interview as a computer operator in London in about 1990. I sit down with the senior operator called Russel who reviews my CV and notes I don&#x27;t have a driving license and that might be an issue for weekend work. I tell him it&#x27;s fine, public transport is great from where I live an that I am looking to buy a motorbike. Russels eyes light up and it turns out he&#x27;s an avid biker so we tell stories, talk about what I am looking for - I even pull out the copy o…</span>

 Some of our most capable engineers use linux. They have vastly different preferences in distro etc.
 There are a few paths that we could go down--forcing specific distros on them, having them work in a virtualized environment, etc. but I&#x27;m wondering how you folks address the problem of both demonstrating that Linux workstations are compliant as well ensuring functional security measures like full disk encryption are in place.

Tracking links in emails are broken.
 
Their status page lies, but they are tweeting the truth.
 The Mandrill management interface fails to load with the message &quot;An Error Occurred. Looks like there was a problem loading this page.&quot;
 Mandrillapp.com frequently fails to load with a 50X error of some variety.
  
Update 01:50 UTC (8:50PM EST): Mandrill application is now responsive, and they are reporting mail flowing. No update yet from their twitter status account. Their Status Page never did report an outage.
 Update 02:16 UTC (9:16 EST): They are tweeting about restoration, saying more info to come. If there&#x27;s something worthwhile, I&#x27;ll copy it here. But, based on the quality of their communication thus far, I&#x27;m not expecting anything useful.

                              <span>I have the opportunity to become the sole sysadmin for a very small company (4 employees). I have zero sysadmin/server experience, and they know this. It&#x27;s rural, and they can&#x27;t find anyone more qualified.
 Obviously, it&#x27;s not ideal for them. What about me? Is sysadmin something that can be learned on the fly, or is this the path to endless misery?
 (Possibly relevant: I have a CS degree, very outdated A+ cert, software dev experience, and I know basic linux stuff. Company&#x27;s servers are a mix of windows &amp; outdated linux.)
 ​
 P.S. I saw that the r/sysadmin wiki has excellent resources - I&#x27;ll certainly be making use of them if I take the job.

                              <span>Hello all, we just migrated on Slack at my company and I’m still learning the basics.
 In France we have what we call « croissantage », the principe is if you leave your computer unattended with your session unlocked one of your colleague is allowed to send a message “croissant” to the whole team on Slack (or any IM / email system) and then you have to bring croissants the next morning at breakfast for everyone.
 This is some sort of security awareness but more fun (well not for everyone ofc). 
 So Im trying to find or create a bot / integration on Slack to do that. So far I found this but it’s not free and I’d like to call it “croissant”. 
 Any idea to help me? Thanks!
 EDIT: I finally found what I was looking for! -&gt; https://ibb.co/1qdh1cZ

 I submitted a P1 support case with them and the first reply I got was an out of office message. Neither of their support numbers are working, they just ring. Something really bad must be going on.

                              <span>The password manager Passwordstate is vulnerable to an authentication bypass, allowing the dumping of plaintext passwords by only knowing the username and having HTTP access to Passwordstate. Completely skipping the password and MFA!
 The fix was released in build 9611 (5th september 2022). So hopefully your Passwordstate instances have been updated by now and are not exposed to the internet.
 The CVE was already published December 19th and proof of concept code is available. I was able to confirm the exploit using the proof of concept code.
 Seems LastPass has a buddy now. /s

 Edit:
 Can anyone try this out on their own vulnerable instance? I&#x27;ve only been able to test this yesterday, however my organization has patched the system now. I want to be absolutely sure that this is as bad as it seems.

                              <span>I was searching for a solution to this question and came across this same question from 8 years ago. Obviously a lot has changed since then so I&#x27;m curious what thoughts the community has about this setup today.
 I&#x27;m setting up a small non-profit, starting from scratch. Since there will only be 5 users initially and likely no more than 10 in the foreseeable future, I&#x27;m questioning whether this office really needs a domain controller. Budget is tight so I&#x27;m trying to help as much as I can to save them money and resources.
 All users will have Office 365 accounts, so they will have access to Azure Active Directory. Microsoft gives a nice discount for non-profits, so that certainly helps!
 What&#x27;s your experience with small offices? What can we leverage from Azure Active Directory to remove the need to an on-site server acting as a domain controller. What about print servers?

                              <span>So I took over a position and I manage a few servers. One of the servers, which hosts our VM&#x27;s, has a 256gb C: drive with 15gbs free. I know it&#x27;s not ideal, but our funding comes from the Government and it&#x27;s a process to get replacements - besides the fact I think there&#x27;s an underlying issue since the drive shouldn&#x27;t be growing like it is. The only thing installed on it is Server 2016, everything else goes to different volumes. This is a classified system, on a private network, so there&#x27;s very little going on in the background, or there shouldn&#x27;t be at least. I cannot use treesize or similiar applications because of the security measures in place. Does anyone have any ideas how I can find out what is continuously filling up the drive? I really don&#x27;t want to have to reinstall the OS. I&#x27;ve done the basics such as clearing caches and disk cleanup, didn&#x27;t get much help there. I imagine it&#x27;s some kind of log files, but near impossible to find without the handy apps.
 Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: Just to be clear, I cannot use 3rd party apps to assist(treesize, windirstat etc), or I would have most definitely done this to start. There&#x27;s a process that has to be taken to classify anything that&#x27;s put on the network (This is a Goverment Top Secret network). And the mighty overseers of the network will gladly tell me to frig off and just reinstall the OS before they allow it.

                              <span>I am making good progress on my crusade to remove Windows XP from the shopfloor of the plant.
 However, some computers give me trouble as they are running 16-bit software, on 32-bit XP (and obviously, the software company is long gone, and replacing millions of dollars worth of heavy machinery because the computer shipped with it is too old is not a possibility)
 Moving forward, I can see two ways of doing this: * Windows 10 32 bit, taking advantage of NTVDM to run the app almost natively, but it feels like running straight into the wall, 32-bit OSs are clearly or the future.
  
Using some kind of emulator, like winevdm, to run the application on 64 bit OS, but I am not sure how business ready this tool is, and how reliable it can be for business critical applications.
  
Do you have some feedback you can share ?

In the description of these logs, there are two things that would interest me: Logon Account and Source Workstation. Would it be possible to somehow create these two information as columns? I saw the &quot;Create custom view&quot; option, but i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. Kind regards :)

 When her Outlook is closed (I have it set to hide when minimized so no matter what its always running in the background) and gets new email slide in notifications fine.
 She wants to also get slide in notifications when Outlook is already open (as in, pulled up on the screen).
 I dont think this is possible, is it?

                              <span>So I moved from an MSP over to a small business with 65 endpoints and have been looking for a documentation software since I am the only one here and need to stay organized. I have used IT Glue in the past and thought it was great. 
 When I decide to look into their prices, I noticed that they have a section for &quot;IT DEPARTMENTS&quot; instead of MSPs. The prices for MSPs show as 5 users minimum whereas for IT Departments it does not say a minimum amount of users (see screenshot). 
 I decide to give them a call (book a demo), and they tell me that for 1 user, the price is $99 / month and they can go as low as $59 / month. None of these prices are shown in the website. See it for yourself -- https://www.itglue.com/it-department/
 Any alternative that you could suggest? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Morning everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to come up with some ideas on how to handle the annoying tasks that require me to go in office.
 For some background, I&#x27;m the sole sysadmin of a &lt;100 person company. We&#x27;ve been mostly WFH since covid, I come into the office when I need. They have been trying to get people to come back 2 days a week, but I haven&#x27;t seen too many people abide by it. I absolutely dread going into the office, especially as of late. I&#x27;m temporarily living about 1.5 hours away from the office with regular traffic and even though I don&#x27;t go in often, it&#x27;s slowly draining me. Other than that and the general office time wasters/chit chat, I enjoy the job and people I work for. It&#x27;s pretty laid back and I get to implement the things I want for the most part. 
 The annoying parts of the j…</span>

 Currently we monitor with reporting from our gateway for internet/vpn activity, CRM with activity logs and selected systems with background monitoring applications. 
 This got the job done with minimal requirements. As we grow, this solution is becoming cumbersome and doesn&#x27;t fit like needed. What are your suggestions for user / systems activity monitoring? 
 We will be in the range of 50 users, 100 - 125 devices (laptop, desktop, mobile and then some) and about 5 to 7 servers. Would like to have reporting on user or device when needed. Open to looking at any platform. Thanks!

                              <span>I am curious as to what different companies do in the event of broken hardware. Of course, I am going to fix/replace said broken hardware ASAP. But I feel like there should be some consequence. Whether that is a report on their HR file, or something. Really would like to hear what kind of policies people have in place for this kind of thing? Or just shrug it off.

 Is it true that the person with certs and a degree will lose out to the person with no certs / degree if the less qualified person is more favored at the office? Especially if the person with no certs is socially active at the company book clubs / sports teams / holiday parties and white elephant gift exchange?
 Is this common in IT?

 ​
 I&#x27;ve found this interesting post but it only prevents the user from using apps, I want everything to be hidden as well and i don&#x27;t want the user to be able to &quot;geek&quot; his way through somehow.
 I&#x27;ve also found that you might be able to use SELinux to do something similar ? I am not experienced enough so if anyone know about a good tutorial about SELinux and apps / users restrictions i would gladly take it as i haven&#x27;t find any satisfying post on the matter yet.

 I&#x27;m trying to convert a godaddy cert to a pfx. I haven&#x27;t done this in three years since the last time I renewed this and probably should have written down how i did it. However, when I import it I don&#x27;t get the option to export key yes/no. Also when I try and export after its been installed pfx is greyed out. Any help would be great.

                              <span>To give some background information: I’m installing Kali Linux as a Virtual Machine on Hyper-V manager on Windows server 2019.
 This is on a Dell PowerEdge R620 server. These servers usually don’t come with a dedicated GPU so in Microsoft for the display card is says “Basic Microsoft Display Adapter”. 
 The Linux installer has a GUI so I’m theory when it boots it should load. I searched the Internet and found out it’s probably a display adapter issue, with most of the “fixes” being to update or install graphics drivers…but I don’t have an nvidia or whatever graphics card to install drivers for. I checked the XFCE server and saw this error (attaching image to this post). 
 https://i.postimg.cc/02gDsq5Q/86-E5976-C-64-EE-44-E2-8452-FC62-E47152-AA.png
 Windows is all up to date, all drivers are good. Upon installing Linux I can do Ctrl alt F3 and get to the CLI to check this stuff. Basically - Kali boots but after the Kali logo (before the log in screen) it just goes to a black screen with a flashing “-“ in the top left. 
 I’ve done these commands sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install update sudo apt install upgrade
 I’ve tried restarting XCFE with the startxfce4 command and then I see the error that it won’t start. I check the log and that’s where I found that error in the screenshot. I’ve reinstalled Kali multiple times to no avail.

 I&#x27;m considering going Rocky, but I&#x27;m also toying with whether it&#x27;s time to move to SLES or Debian or ... well, something else entirely.
 I&#x27;ve scope to &#x27;clean slate&#x27; the environment if I want, but our overall goal is having the same OS on Desktops and Servers (yes, we do have linux desktops as our primary platform). 
 If it was your call, which Linux would you choose and why? (Or would it be some other *nix?)

                              <span>Hi guys,
 happy new year!
 Wondering if others have stumbled across this issue:
 We have a script in our environment that reads IP Ranges from a Sharepoint list to add it to the Named Locations in Azure for our CA-Policies.
 The Azure AD Cmdlet for this is:
 Set-AzureADMSNamedLocationPolicy (AzureAD) | Microsoft Learn 
 The cmdlet replacing it is:
 Update-MgIdentityConditionalAccessNamedLocation (Microsoft.Graph.Identity.SignIns) | Microsoft Learn 
 However, the cmdlet doesn&#x27;t allow to add IP Ranges, at least there is no parameter for it.
 Used this link to find the cmdlet map:
 Find Azure AD and MSOnline cmdlets in Microsoft Graph PowerShell | Microsoft Learn

                              <span>This has been driving me up the walls lately. We run secondary sites on low bandwidt DPs (on boats), and I&#x27;ve set those sites up for prestaged content. 
 I&#x27;ve packaged some updates / applications in pkgx files using configuration manager, and sent them to the site on a USB drive. But when I try to extractcontent.exe /P:C:\prestage\stuff.pkgx it uncompresses but then doesn&#x27;t extract. Upon checking the PrestageContent.log it keeps failing with error &quot;SetObjectSecurity failed; 0x8007051b&quot;. 
 It runs on an elevated cmd, user is a member of Administrators on the server. I&#x27;ve even tried setting up a fresh dummy DP on a virtual PC and repeated the same thing but I get the same error there too. The dp is &quot;configured for prestaged content&quot; and I am running out of ideas. 
 Anyone here experienced something similar? I&#x27;ve tried googling the error message, seems to be related to admin rights, but I get zero hits on SCCM related errors. I&#x27;ve tried doing this using the local admin account, domain admin account and other members of the Administrators group on the server. The folders on the site all seem to be owned by &quot;administrators&quot; so I don&#x27;t see why this fails...

 So I am not sure if I am doing it wrong or just not supported (and need to come up with a workaround, I do have other options- including adding a line or 2 into my c# app to create the key on app start).
 So I have a custom-built app that uses a custom URL schema. I am able to register it etc into the registry so someone can type in &quot;coolapp://blah&quot; in start-&gt; run or by clicking on a link in their favourite browser and it would fire up my app and pass on prams etc.
 Now what I need to do is allow Outlook desktop app to open those links without getting this &quot;Microsoft Outlook Security Notice - Microsoft Office has identified a potential security concern.&quot; message.
 I can add the custom url schema key in &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Security\Trusted Protocols\All Applications&quot; and Outlook won&#x27;t complain anymore for the current logged user.
 Now when I went to put that same key under &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Security\Trusted Protocols\All Applications&quot; (and remove the one in HKEY_CU) I am finding that Outlook is not picking up the key under HKEY_LM and starts complaining again.
 Am I trying to do something that is not supported or am I putting it in the wrong place?
 I followed this: https://superuser.com/questions/1365501/office-365-ver-1809-how-do-i-specify-trusted-protocols and it got me 1/2 way there - ideally I would like to set it global and be done with it.
 Running GPRESULT /H GPReport.html brings up nothing and gpupdate /force and rebooting didn&#x27;t help.
 Cheers

 ​
 Hoping for some quick help. Working with a client where they have a Remote Desktop Gateway, We have an external URL remote.mydomain.com that we use for this. I can access the site.
 The certificate expired and had to be renewed, I added the new certificate to IIS as remote.mydomain.com and the site now lists as protected. I added the same certificate in RD Gateway Manager, and everything comes up as green, but when I try to access the apps, I get the following message:
 ​
 Your computer can&#x27;t connect to the remote computer because the Remote Desktop Gateway server address requested and the certificate subject name do not match. Contact your administrator for assistance. When I view the certificate, it shoes the valid remote.mydomain.com certificate. 
 ​
 What am I missing?
 ​
 Thank you,

I have never encountered this before. how in the world do you quantify keeping everything running: servers, network, end-points day-to-day to tickets, literally everything the business has to have going to conduct business.? It seems hard to tie a real number to everything it takes to keep the environment running property even though without us the business would come to a swift halt. Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Trying to cut the fat out of the question and keep it simple. Will answer any questions.
 Can I just implement QOS on the firewall to do a form of &#x27;packet queuing&#x27; prior to traffic reaching the ISP, or must I implement QOS across the entire LAN to get my intended effect?
 
 I have one machine that I want to prioritize over anything else. My LAN is Gig everywhere, but we only have 200Mbps symmetrical for WAN.
 Example: We have 120 Mbps average traffic to internet during business day, and the priority machine wants to use more than the remaining 80 Mbps.
 Firewall is a Sophos XG310. Switches are mainly HP ProCurve, but there are slew of others too. Hoping to not have to futz with all of the switches.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently looking at Mist from a wireless perspective. Currently we are an all Cisco shop (Routers/Switches/WLC&#x27;s/AP&#x27;s and DNAC for assurance). Would it be possible to run a Mist environment on top of a Cisco switching/routing platform as a POC? I&#x27;m thinking more end to end trace clientapswitch&gt;&gt;core. I don&#x27;t see our org ripping out the Cisco switching/routing but possibly the Wi-Fi as long as I can end to end trace such as what DNAC can provide.
 ​
 Thoughts?
 Thank you

                              <span>This is a shot in the dark but I may as well ask.
 I have a Cisco ASA configured for staff VPN, it&#x27;s working great. But all of the sudden last night I&#x27;m getting a HUGE uptick in event logs from my Domain Controller handling authentication. Typically I see about 100 logs a week or so (we have about 100 employees and connecting to the vpn is not a requirement with remote work). But now it&#x27;s in the 1,000,000&#x27;s and is blowing out my cloud logging ingest budget.
 What&#x27;s odd is I never usually see this AD account log in, but now i&#x27;m seeing it all the time, also it&#x27;s authenticating accounts just fine. Its just being.......extremely noisy.
 I also have not done any changes to the firewall, nor anyone else. I&#x27;ve been on vacation since the middle of December.
 -Rebooted DC&#x27;s already but it seems like it may have helped a little bit
 Like I said, it&#x27;s a shot in the dark if anyone had and specific issues with this authentication weirdness, and has any suggestions that would be great!

                              <span>I’m looking for an uplink solution between a PD host PoE switch. The PD end requires 70W (up to 90W at port). That said, the data throughput is tiny — a few hundred MB/s max from appx 12-15 devices per switch. Available switch options w/ this PoE++ capability kind of standardizes high bandwidth function, like QSFP or SFP+. Given, the aggregated data flow is far below thresholds for QSFP or even SFP+. Also keeping in mind, the Tx/Rx properties of the modules and mode properties of the fiber are compatible. 
 Now to my query — can an LC QSFP uplink to an LC SFP/SFP+ interface port on the aggregate switch?

 I&#x27;m finishing up my professional track on Ariba now. I was going Juniper, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m better off going Cisco and Palo Alto. 
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>What&#x27;s the consensus on using network segmentation and firewalls to control management access to such devices.
 EG: 
  
Firewall/network equipment management interfaces. 
 Domain controllers (RDP, RPC or WMI etc etc)
 Radius/TACACS services
  
The attempt is to control access (Using identity based access via firewall eventually move to ZTNA) on such devices that manage other services within the domain/LAN but... issues arise when there is only one NIC which is used for access as well as standard service traffic. 
 Is there a clean way to accomplish this? Really easy to do on networking devices, but servers or apps depending on what they are adding a second interface and routing only specific traffic is a toss up.
 Anyone have any words of wisdom or is this a you&#x27;ll need to build as you go rather than overhaul.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey guys, i&#x27;m looking for a bit of suggestion on multi tenant network design/automation. Mostly looking for your experiences for a single pane of glass for automating and deploying tenants network infrastructure. This is the lay of the land but basically looking at trying to figure out a way to auto spin up firewall instances or at least the configuration piece of this. What have you guys had success with?

                              <span>Concept I can&#x27;t understand - In an IPv4 packet, the size of the payload in the first fragment, in octets, is equal to Total Length - (4 * Internet Header Length). If this value is less than the required minimum (8 octets for TCP), then this fragment and the entire packet are rejected. what could be an alternative method of achieving the same result using only the Fragment Offset field?

                              <span>I worked on a wifi solution several years ago. It was the time the Wireless controller was king and we went with cisco stacks (Catalyst 3850 if I recall correctly) with integrated WLC functionality.
 Despite the AAA complex setup (handled by ISE and Active Directory) we managed to have it working correctly in a very fast way, and it proved solid and stable even after we added a domain trust after a company merge (basically we had two companies wifi SSIDs for both employees PCs, with different certificates and CAs).
 I&#x27;m not a Cisco fan anymore (since at least 10 years, after everything became a license), but I must admit that setup was old days(C) cool. 
 ​
 Now I took a glimpse to the current scenario, and everything is cloud based and AI managed and visually simple and 
 and shitty shitty shitty no CLI whatsoever and centrally administered (by someone else), microservices (what the hell is microservice for a tunnel?) and cloud-who-cares-where-it-runs.
 ​
 I know this is going to be our (hellish?) future, but I just want to put a couple of stackable switches, run the controller on them and attach (with dual redundant cables, possibly) as many AP as I need or the software allows to.
 Does any of you have a branded, enterprise or at least SMB ready solution, with local, non-cloud based wireless solution?
 I saw Cisco now sells the controller on the APs directly, but besides of a small scale (I could survive), I fear about bad performance and I would need to buy switches (with probably way more horsepower than a single AP) to connect the APs anyway.

                              <span>So I apologize if this is a stupid question but I am curious to how this functions.
 ​
 say you are denying all outbound traffic besides services that are required for a server to function, per your software vendor you create some firewall objects (*.SASvendor.com) and create an l3 rule to allow traffic to said vendor. If I were to do an nslookup to get a hostname from that IP that the software is communicating with it resolves a AWS datacenter address, but if I know the address that it is communicating with say... (prod1.SASvendor.com) it resolves to to that IP. I assumed that when the firewall is asked to resolve the DNS record it becomes aware of the FQDN and says ok yep that is good, but my DNS server is not forwarding DNS to the firewall, so how does the firewall know that an IP address is part of the *SASvendor.com domain? I create the rules and it works but I just like to understand how this works..
 ​
 Thanks!

 I am a net/sys admin in DFW. We are currently migrating to Aruba switches for our whole campus, and with the migration process, we are looking for a good network management and monitoring tool. I have looked into Aruba Central, but I&#x27;m not sold on it.
 We have licensing for SolarWinds NPM, but nobody ever really set it up. Does anyone have any solid suggestions? What I am looking for is:
  
Email alerts
 CLI access
 Diagraming
  
These are pretty basic requirements, but I know there are more benefits to different solutions. I am all ears.
 ​
 Thanks!

 I have an application (Twingate) running at a remote site, which needs to connect to public IP&#x27;s outbound on TCP 30000-31000.
 Occasionally, and intermittently, Twingate reports that it cannot connect to these IP&#x27;s on these ports and suggests the ports are blocked. The remote site is within a serviced office. We operate our own firewall, which is connected to some internal/unknown networking at the serviced office, which is handed off to the local carrier. We have a publicly routable IP addresses on our firewall.
 Is there a way to find out which upstream device is blocked these ports?

                              <span>ok, so we need a mobile network that we can transfer all the time. So my idea was to get Mikrotik Chateau LTE18 as a router, Ubiquiti Networks U6-PRO for the access point, and Cloud Key Gen2. With that would get small UPS to plug it all in that and a small rack to store it.
 ​
 What do you guys think, is that going to withstand 40-50 devices at the same time? Once we get on location we are fixed, and we need our network for all users and their tablets (40-50). Was also thinking about getting some additional LTE antenna if we lack signal quality.
 ​
 Problem is that I read about the chateau sometimes just stop working and needs to be restarted, never used it myself so I&#x27;m not sure how reliable is it?

                              <span>Hi,
 i got a request from a customer regarding a special use case, he wants to integrate Devices without Wifi Capabilities in a existing Campus WiFi, it will be around 60 Devices.
 The Campus WiFi is authenticating with 802.1x with certificates, the certs should be managed from one central Controller.
 Is there any Vendor that offers APs that can operate as Clients and integrate in a already existing WiFi or is offering WiFi Bridges that can be managed from a Controller?
 I found the Aruba 501 Wireless Bridge, which seems to offer everything we need, but i am not sure if it is manageable from any kind of controller.

                              <span>Background: certain users submit their mac-address to be added to a specific network. We approve the request and add whitelist the mac-address and provide a password for them. Below is the entry I add to the users&#x27; file /etc/freeradius/3.0/users
 aabbccddeeff Cleartext-Password :&#x3D; aabbccddeeff Tunnel-Password &#x3D; password123 
 End Goal: I want to move away from the flat file so that I can automate most of the process. In my testing I figured out how to add the first line into radcheck however I can&#x27;t figure out where or how to add Tunnel-Password &#x3D; password123
 INSERT INTO radcheck VALUES (1, &#x27;aabbccddeeff&#x27;, &#x27;Cleartext-Password&#x27;, &#x27;:&#x3D;&#x27;, &#x27;aabbccddeeff&#x27;); 
 Am I doing something completely wrong/incorrect approach or is it something simple?

                              <span>We are currently planning towards upgrading and refresh our 15 years old cisco gears (70 switches with 1500 end devices/users) but leaning towards SDA solution, I&#x27;d like to get feedback from others who implemented it. Does it worth to implement SDA or is it better to stick with traditional design Collapsed Core.
 Existing network is basically all Layer 2 VLANs extend up to SVIs on core switches.
 We don&#x27;t have NAC solution at present but surely will be added with upgrade project.
 Appreciate any advice.

 Hope someone here can shed some light on their experiences in this field as jobs doing this kind of stuff isn&#x27;t something I imagine you&#x27;d find on some normal job boards.

                              <span>I am helping out a small non-profit to upgrade its network. They are pretty budget conscious so looking at the 1930 instant on with a Fortinet fg40f. Ideally looking at 3 switch locations with 5-6 VLANs max. Can the Instant-on do the layer 3 routing or should the firewall do the routing in this environment? Or should I scrap this idea and go with something different?

                              <span>This seems to come up a lot in discussions with potential clients and hiring managers. But it feels like there are far too many people who see it as black magic or the next greatest thing without really understanding how it works or what the benefits are. So I want to hear from you. Did you implement a segment routing solution? Why (or why not)? How did it work out for you?

                              <span>We currently use Unify AP&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t really have control over and it seems like the local controller software that the previous person used no longer exists. I need to re-setup everything as I want to start using VLAN&#x27;s. However after reading all the horrible things abut their business practices on deploying firmware upgrades, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable paying $29 a month for the cloud controller. 
 I&#x27;ve been reading that the Aruba Instant On AP&#x27;s are good. How are they for someone whose actually a network admin vs just some person who wants an easy to setup WLAN? I&#x27;d go with meraki ones if I was actually going to keep the meraki after expiration, but I want to get rid of that piece of garbage. 
 As for size, we currently have about 8,512 SF office space with most of it being open concept with some people in offices. Currently 20 people but planning on growing. Also possibly opening multiple locations world wide so would like to easily control these. 
 Would the Aruba Instant On&#x27;s be good for this or should I look at something a bit more enterprise? Growth and security are top priority for me.

                              <span>We have a mix of Cisco routers at our remote sites that create either route based or policy based site-to-site VPN tunnels back to our main datacenter firewall.
 The policy based VPNs tunnel ALL traffic back to the datacenter, including Internet. This is done with an ACL like:
 permit ip 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 Our route based VPNs only tunnel a handful of subnets back to the datacenter. We have static routes like:
 ip route 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 Tunnel0
 My question is how would I convert our policy based VPNs into a route based VPN when ALL traffic should be tunneled? If I create an ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Tunnel0 statement, it would break the current default route for our routers to get to the next hop, which is the ISP router.

Is it possible to save the IP of the peer that the keys &quot;is_up&quot; and &quot;is_enabled&quot; are false to a variable and have a config file with the no commands ready to go and plug in the saved IP?
 I&#x27;m working on trying to figure this out but getting stuck on saving the IP of the peer since the variable is a dictionary of dictionaries.

Should they be proactively replaced after X years? While the downstream devices do have LACP to the switch, the traffic is fault sensitive and mission critical.
 Should I just replace them all out-of-hand as a few seem to have already failed?

                              <span>Problem: Need to set up fully redundant nework for NAS/SAN and Hypervisors
 Question: Looking for an affordable, but easy to manage switch/platform that will provide me with a completely redundant network configuration.
 Topology: 
 |--------Primary Router------Switch-----|
 ISP Switch | X | |--------NAS, Hypervisor
 |---------Backup Router------Switch-----|
 NOTE: Routers have connections to both switches, and switches have connections between each other. This is the only way I can think to be redundant in the event that 1 switch goes down. I don&#x27;t have a fully VRRP router setup, just online/standby. One router has to go down completely before the second kicks in.
 ​
 Additional Background:
 I have a iXSystems X20 NAS with 2 controllers running on my network. I have been running into issues where the NAS will freak out and drop all connections when there is a change on the local network (switch firmware update or VLAN changes). I am currently using a UniFi Switch Aggregation switch to connect the NAS to my ESXi hypervisors.
 I am hoping to solve this issue, but I am not familiar with every redundancy technology. I know I will probably need to purchase other switches, but need to know where to start looking and what other people have in their setups.

 At first I was able to factory reset the router and go into the initial configure boot menu options, then from there I loaded a new IOS image on to the flash, but after I deleted the old versions of the flash I am unable to factory reset and get back into the initial configure options.
 Below is the set command output:

 When attempting to boot system from flash I receive this error:
 Booting image: system.... Error 15: File not found 
 Despite my dir command showing that the desired file is there.
 I am awaiting a new rommon package to be sent to me, but without being able to boot rommon mode 2, I am not sure how I would apply the new package.

                              <span>Hi guys. My company is increasingly leveraging the cloud to the point where I believe a full migration from on-prem is not far round the corner. Just as an overall point of discussion, what is the general approach to take when migrating from on-prem at multiple offices around the world to, say, Azure? For example, we have 2 offices on the east and west coast in the US and 3 offices in Asia. Is it advisable to have a separate VNet for each office or would you setup VNets for multiple offices in generally the same geographical area? Interested to know people&#x27;s thoughts...

                              <span>Hi guys, Net Eng from ISP here, we lease several xPON lines with a particular issue, which is bad performance with tcp single session only in upload direction (Cpe to server). The upload technology works like this, dedicated fiber till a street OLT, then pon branches to the office, downstream is multicast (not 100% sure, but I don&#x27;t care cause I don&#x27;t have problems) while upstream is in TDM, configured on the OLT, with one slot for each customer in the PON tree. Do any of you have experienced similar issues with TDM technologies? Or single session tcp issues? I&#x27;ve already broke down the issue to this, so no latency/BDP/matis etc issues
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I work for a very small charity in the UK (a rehab with clients living on site). Over the Christmas period BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and even Prime video started blocking all devices on our network from accessing content. On all services I get messages saying we are either not in the UK or using a VPN. We are based in the UK with a static IP address from a UK based ISP. We don&#x27;t send our traffic out through a proxy server or a VPN at all (although we do have one remote user who gets into our network through a VPN to our Router). Does anyone know what it is about our IP address or network that would cause this? Any ideas why we are getting flagged and how to fix would be appreciated.

                              <span>Every Friday for 10 minutes I get a PRTG sensor for 443 that goes down. I try ssh&#x27;ing into the box and I&#x27;m unable to get in until the sensor comes up. I log into the box and see a bunch of logs of an obvious brute force attack on 443
 The logs look like below
 Dec 30 18:48:04.400 UTC: %SEC_LOGIN-1-QUIET_MODE_ON: Still timeleft for watching failures is 0 secs, [user: foo] [Source: 192.168.1.5] [localport: 443] [Reason: Login Authentication Failed - BadPassword] [ACL: sl_def_acl] at 13:48:04 
 Here&#x27;s the thing though, we are a strictly class A 10.0.0.0/8 network. There isn&#x27;t a single 192.168.1.0/24 network in our enterprise. So I&#x27;m kinda stumped on how this is happening and what I should do. 
 I think I&#x27;d like to just turn on having 443 available for login, because I don&#x27;t really use it.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>So I’m a complete bonehead and I ran wires to 4 rooms with flat network patch cables through the walls. Apparently I’m an idiot because I never knew that flat patch cables are almost impossible to re-terminate after they’re pressed at the factory.
 I cut off the ends of the cables and have been struggling to terminate them correctly. My uncle says it’s impossible and that I used the wrong cable …I’m determined to terminate these without having to run new wires…
 He claims the gauge of the wires in the flat cable are too small and that the rj45 connector pins won’t bite fully into them when they’re crimped. This seems to be the case because every time I terminate one, the results on the tester keep changing.
 Is there any way I can terminate these ?! Is there a special rj45 connector I’ve never heard of?
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I have set up private endpoint for various Azure resources (SQL Server, Web Apps etc.) and set up conditional forwarding to the Azure wire server within our DNS configuration.
 A ping resolves to the private IP of the server (i.e. that of the private endpoint) when testing from Azure VM&#x27;s within the VNET, but when testing from local machines, it seems to flip flop between returning the private IP and returning the public azure endpoint, meaning I can sometimes connect through to these resources from my machine (when the private IP is being returned) and sometimes not (when the public IP is being returned).
 We have our local machines pointing at Cisco Umbrella for their DNS resolution already, and have therefore opted to have the relevant azure endpoints forward onto our VM-based DNS servers using Umbrella&#x27;s in-built DNS forwarding capabilities. 
 If I test through this method I can replicate the issue, if I override this method using my hosts file (pointing the relevant URL&#x27;s directly at their private endpoint IP address), it works consistently, suggesting the issue is with Cisco Umbrella, and it is not consistently handling the requests.
 Any ideas on how to resolve this?

                              <span>Hello All,
 I currently have a portacabin set up with a slow (4-7 Mbps) DSL line and I am looking for advice on the best way to upgrade it. My options have been presented as follows:
 1) point to point wireless connection - this could be an effective way of connecting portacabin to base office but I am concerned that the large ships around the operation could adversely affect the connection.
 2) Ethernet circuit (leased line) - I have been advised this is a costly option.
 3) Starlink connection. Not a great match with our current Watchguard Firewall as it&#x27;s a bit of a pain to configure but is probably one of the better options in my opinion.
 Interested to hear what professionals/experts have to say about the above. Thank you in advance.

 I&#x27;m familiar with a few, but I haven&#x27;t extensively used most of them. Wondering if any &quot;one&quot; is superior to the rest, and why:
 ​
  
Drawboard PDF (Read + basic Markup edits only)
 Foxit PDF (Unsure)
 Adobe Acrobat Reader (Read only)
 Adobe Acrobat Pro (Read + Edits)
 Browser / HTML [Brave] (Read only)
  
​
 What is important for me in a PDF Reader:
  
Ability to read the PDF (lol)
 Relatively fast launch time
 Fast ability to search text with CTRL-F in large PDF&#x27;s (aka textbooks)
  
What is important for me in a PDF Editor:
  
Ability to highlight text
 Ability to write text (Like, PDF Form)
 Ability to edit, add, or remove the layout, text, and pictures.
 (optional) Ability to comment (Like, notes in a PDF textbook)

                              <span>I am needing to ship USED laptops from the U.S. to various countries in APAC and EMEA. This is part of a cost saving measure so that those countries do not need to source laptops locally, it will clear space in our U.S. office, and utilize laptops that are just sitting around with warranties that are expiring (we&#x27;ve confirmed that the warranty is good globally).
 ​
 I&#x27;ve been looking at DHL, but I&#x27;m curious, what are your recommendations and why? Also, does anybody have experiences they&#x27;d like to share?
 ​
 Thank you!

 Not snapping, and not using 3rd party software because they want to do it on a regulated machine.

 Apparently VP saw this somewhere, but I do not think this is possible in vanilla windows 10 LTSC. But I am never going to hear the end of it for the next like week so I thought should through it out into the void and see if it rings a bell for anyone.
 I am pretty sure they were seeing some sort of TV with multiple inputs for each quadrant or they loaded 3rd party software to do it even though they shouldn&#x27;t where they saw it.

                              <span>Good evening,
 The environment that I work at is using VMware Volumes to deploy web applications such as Chrome, Edge, Etc. I have an application that is installed on the golden image that calls upon the default browser to auto start a web Applicaiton. The instructions stated to put the program installed on the golden image in the &quot;Startup&quot; folder which would normally launch the application. VMware Volumes is not instant and i know that so instead i made a scheduled task to start the program 90 seconds after the initial login (It doesn&#x27;t actually take 90 seconds for Chrome to appear). The scheduled task runs as the &quot;BuiltIN\Users&quot; group which i assumed would take on whoever actually is logged in sort of like a wild card. I am finding that the application will launch and launch fine when clicking on the desktop icon, but when its ran from the scheduled task it doesn&#x27;t work properly.
 Is there some other group I can use that would assume the logged in user? Yes i considered writing a simple powershell script or batch script, however both of those are blocked as per domain policy.

 I wanted to get some input from the community. I&#x27;m a Linux guy by nature and in this role I&#x27;ve inherited a Windows environment. In a nutshell - I have two Hyper-V servers I plan to convert to VMWare (bought the 3-year license before Broadcom shenanigans). These servers were stood up by a previous admin who consolidated 15 physical servers.
 On ONE (no joke) host, I have 3 separate file servers, 12TB, 25TB and 60 TB. That&#x27;s actual data, not provisioned disk size. I set up Veeam backup, and the data dedups down to about 40TB total. Clearly there is a crap-ton of duplicate data. Side note: I&#x27;ve never been able to get any sort of vMotion-esqe behavior out of the two hyper-v h…</span>

                              <span>I really need some advice, if you would all be so kind. I recently started a new position, the interviews went really well, I got detailed information about the department I would be managing and the unique needs it has. I was offered a significant pay increase (think 30-35%). However, I have now heard from both my new supervisor and another source I trust that the position is going to be changed- instead of managing IT for a small department, I would be managing someone doing that role as well as the larger groups main help desk.
 This was never mentioned in the interviews, and isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m interested in. I had several other offers on the table while searching last year, and have been approached for a number of other positions since accepting this one. I&#x27;m torn. On one hand it feels incredibly inconsiderate to immediately turn around and leave...but I was deceived about the true role I would be in. 
 Anyone been here before? Any advice?

I need then for VMs, and outside of $200 a piece from MS, I cant find a good way to go about this. Were mostly an Apple shop, but I do have an O365 instance. Also I do not have an agreement with a reseller. TIA for any recs!

Today he called and texted me asking me to call him about our server and backups. No additional info, no emails with details… It’s been two hours and I’ve not called him back.
 I have a lot flexibility where I work but hot damn, I cherish my days off and don’t want work interruptions unless it’s an actual emergency. There are other people on the team that are working today, put their feet to the fire.
 I’m not on call this week. I may regret it but I won’t call him back until tomorrow and just say I had my phone off. I’m tired of this disrespect.

                              <span>I might be missing it, but is there a reference anywhere in the Dell world for the details on the hundreds of different alert items you can set in iDRAC? I&#x27;m looking for a reference describing the exact conditions that trip the &quot;Critical&quot; vs. &quot;Warning&quot; vs. &quot;Information&quot; alerts for every alert on their list (Not to mention what some of them even mean - I&#x27;m looking at you, &#x27;Witness Server&#x27;). I assumed of course that this 900-page guide must be somewhere, but I cannot seem to locate it.
 I don&#x27;t want to miss something important, while at the same time don&#x27;t want to get drowned in spurious alerts.

                              <span>Hey team, remember that flexible work policy we started working on pre Covid and that allowed us to rapidly react to the pandemic by having everyone take their laptop home and work near flawlessly from home? Remember how like 70% of the team moved out of state to be closer to family or find a lower cost of living since we haven&#x27;t bothered to give cost of living increases that even remotely keep up with inflation? Remember how with the extremely rare exception of a hardware failure you haven&#x27;t even seen the server hardware you work on in nearly 3 years? Well have I got good news for you! 
 We have some new executives and they like working in the office because that&#x27;s how their CEO fathers worked in 1954 and he taught them well. Unfortunately with everyone working from home they feel a bit lonely. There is nobody in the building for them to get a better parking place then. Nobody for them to make nervous as they walk through the abandoned cubicle farms. There is also a complete lack of attractive young females at the front desk for them to subtly harass. How can they possibly prove that they work the hardest if they don&#x27;t see everyone else go home before them each evening?
 To help them with their separation anxiety we will now be working in the office again. If you moved out of state I am sorry but we will be accounting for that when we review staff for annual increases and promotion opportunities, whatever those are. New hires will be required to be from the local area so they can commute and cuddle as well. 
 Wait, hold on one sec, my inbox keeps dinging, why do I have 12 copies of the same email? Oh I see They are not all the same, they just all have the same subject line. Wait! you can&#x27;t all quit! Not at the same time. Oh good Bob, you were in the office today, wait what&#x27;s this? Oh Come on, a postit note? You couldn&#x27;t even use a full sheet of paper?

                              <span>Today, January 3rd, I received a request to look in a user&#x27;s account for a receipt email for a subscription that needs to be canceled. 
 Me: Does that mean that $user is no longer with us?
 HR: Yes, $user&#x27;s last day was 3 FUCKING WEEKS AGO (emphasis mine). We asked them to get with you to return their equipment!
 Me, fighting through an aneurysm: There are no receipt emails in $user&#x27;s account. However, there is an exchange between you and $user where you signed off on using $user&#x27;s personal email for the subscription.
 HR: I&#x27;m aware of that exchange. Thanks for checking.
 So, to recap:
  
All of $user&#x27;s accounts have been active for 3 weeks since their departure.
 I have no idea where user&#x27;s equipment is.
 HR is co-signing subscriptions tied to personal email addresses.
  
Happy new year!

                              <span>Sigh, maybe I am just bitter as this just happened to me.
 But this keeps happening.
 I am part time IT support for a location as the ownership is still too damn cheap to transition me to full time hours and benefits despite our business picking up after Covid.
 So I work my three days and have been for over a year.
 But dumbasses on site who got a hold of my number as management shared it like chickenpox call me at all hours of the day &quot;Taco are you on site?, Taco are you working today ?, Taco have you seen the ticket I submitted 3 nanoseconds ago (if they even send in a ticket) ? Taco something IT knows is a issue but they keep getting denied the budget to fix is broken , what&#x27;s your backup plan ? &quot;
 ​
 Its freaking frustrated none of them seem to have any respect for my private life, 3 times this morning I was woken up while still in bed (now to be fair one of those was Oracle (and that&#x27;s its own rant that they don&#x27;t seem to ever check time zones for gods sakes )), i get called at like 2AM by the night shift staff and there&#x27;s no empathy there, no apology for waking me up in the dead of the night, instead &quot;why are you always so grumpy when I call? &quot;
 I don&#x27;t know jackass, maybe its because its been a long week and I am trying to sleep and you call me for your petty shit!!!
 ​
 Sigh...I need to get out of that place, its going to kill me with stress if I let it out.
 And I will smile and laugh as things go to hell without me there, as the only other IT person for the organization is 2 hours drive away with good traffic. Not the location, the Organization, a organization with locations on 2 continents.
 That is how goddamn cheap they are.
 What about the rest of you, anyone else got cases of being treated like crap with your phone and personal life ?

                              <span>Hey /r/sysadmin i&#x27;m following up on this previous post I made:
  
Currently, i&#x27;m working on a project to put as many of our systems as possible through our Duo Network Gateway (DNG from here forward). 
 The end goal is to put every administrative interface behind the DNG while we implement Zero Trust. (Being inside or outside the org doesn&#x27;t mean I trust you, there is no inherently trusted device.) To reach a device you first need to use a MFA secured portal to verify your identity. 
 As part of this we are attempting to move our VMWare vSphere web interface behind our DNG, it appears natively this is not supported so we are first going through a NGINX reverse proxy to present a single supported web interface.
  
Here is the config needed in NGINX to make this work for all parts of vSphere…</span>

Like clock work, EVERY Tuesday 5 of my users get disconnected from Microsoft exchange. They lose access to teams, outlook, etc. I have opened a car with Microsoft 5 times about it and their &quot;fixed&quot; work for a week and then drop again and again. I have done the following: 
  
Used their stupid SARA tool to uninstall and reinstall
 Updated the registry to force modern authentication
 Fully updated the machines
 Removed the &quot;work or school&quot; profile
 New user profile and new email profile. 
  
The most INFURIATING thing is it&#x27;s only a select few out of 70 users. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>First day back at work and spent a few hours with this one. Small client had a Xerox installed last year. We added it via IP on each of the PCs. Mid morning today it started showing as offline on all PCs, despite us being able to access it&#x27;s web GUI and ping it. We were able to add it again via WSD, but not via IP. After some googling we found that changing it over to from RAW to LP and a few other settings fixed it.
 I&#x27;m curious as to why there might be a sudden change. I thought an over the air update to printer, but can&#x27;t see anything in it&#x27;s logs to suggest that might be it?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 ​
 Does anyone know any open source solution that can monitor and trigger alerts when a new setting is added/removed/modified to a certain GPO?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Need help. For the past few weeks, I have had problems connecting to different servers (both 2008 and 2022) in rdp using the name of the machine. Going through the ip, I don&#x27;t encounter any problem.
 I correctly ping the machine using its name. I checked in my firewall (not that of windows) but my connection is made correctly. In the event viewer, I see the RUNAS audit which is validated.
 I tried to go through the FQDN specifying the domain but no improvement.. The nslookup and the tracert is ok.
 I imagine Windows recently made an update that caused this malfunction..?
 Any ideas?

 ​
 My company has a large number of unnused GPOs.This causes login issues when the user attempts to authenticate some other systems within our enterprise.
 I have been asked to do an audit of all the GPO in our domain. Are there any untilities I can use to accomplish this? I need to remove the unused GPO without effecting our production environment.
 Thanks,

 From what I&#x27;ve read and experienced it seems like Dell is the only brand that is not easy to work with when it comes to non-warranty repairs. (If you are certified under the Dell TechDirect program, Dell will ship parts for warranty and Dell ADP claims) If Chromebooks are outside of warranty Dell has processes in place that try to steer school districts to sales to buy new Chromebooks. If sales are pressed for a quote for parts they purposely make it ridiculously high.
 It is possible to acquire parts from other resellers however Dell makes the availability of the RMA sh…</span>

                              <span>We have turned on auditing for Sensitive Privilege Use (both Success and Failure), per STIG V-220770. However, this has led to hundreds of Audit Failures per minute on nearly every endpoint. When checking the Event Viewer I see it&#x27;s mainly for Teams and Edge (errors below).
 These logs are filling up a lot of space in Splunk, and so our security asked us to track down the cause. I&#x27;ve seen this come up a lot online, but the only real solutions I&#x27;ve seen is to turn off auditing, but that will then flag us for not following STIG.
 Hoping someone has found a proper resolution to this issue, thank you!

 &quot;The manufacturing and office networks should be separate, with only strictly controlled interconnections allowed. Since this isn’t something that is accomplished overnight, we’d like to recommend that this requirement be implemented prior to the 2024 renewal.&quot;
 Background:
 I am a 1 man IT dept for a manufacturing company. Our on-prem physical file server currently houses all shared files. The people in the office and the people on the shop floor need access to the same shared files all day every day. Unsure how to respond or go about this.

                              <span>So my wife and I were looking for a project to work that we could leverage to possibly help us in our business and upskill some of our SWE skills. We have begun to try and centralize our organization&#x27;s (and other organizations that we work with) communication and kind of command center on Microsoft 365 and specifically Teams, but augmented by the whole ecosystem. In our opinion, it makes things simpler for many users, and we have been decently happy with Microsoft products over other vendors.
 We decided to develop a ticketing system/helpdesk software. Obviously this is a crowded space, but we could only find one other option that allowed you to work with the tool in any serious way inside of Teams. We are planning to add some other features that may be less focused on with the bigger brands as well, but overall it will be a simple, affordable, SaaS that can be utilized through a web browser on our standalone site OR entirely through Teams - for both the technicians and the end-users.
 This started out (and has been a great success!) as just wanting to build something that we would at least use and that we could learn from. However, as we build it out more - I am wondering if:
  
This is something you or anyone you know would actually use/like? 
 What additional features would you love to see in a product like this?
 Would you pay for it?
  
Appreciate your thoughts, have a good day!

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m looking for a solution for creating forms - mainly for manual check-ups on hardware and software.
 I have tried Acrobat Pro DC, but it seems rather tedious and the text-formatting is unstable, at least when I edit or try to move text-fields and so forth.
 Essentially what I am looking for:
 - Offline (If possible)
 - If/Else (Example: Ability to hide text-fields unless a checkbox is checked)
 - Export to PDF when filled.
 - Easier scripting for the if/elses?
 I thought an interactive PDF would be the easiest way to accomplish this, does anyone know any better or is Acrobat perfectò?
 We have M365, can is Microsoft Forms good enough for this?
 Greets!

                              <span>Hi,
 im a sysadmin (mostly windows) and my coding is mostly limited to powershell, although i learned a bit of C a long time ago and dabbled with C#.
 Now i want to develop a small tool that does the following:
 - running as a service on a windows machine- accept commands (via REST-API would be best i think?)- execute PowerCLI Cmdlets (Powershell)
 Im not really well versed in .NET programming. My first instinct was to write a Powershell-Script and let it run as a service by a tool like nssm or use something like Powershell Universal. Then i found out you can run ASP.NET core in a windows service. Not shure how to execute powershell from this though.
 Maybe someone has advice about which technique would be the best for my task? Or maybe there is a framework or tool that already does what i want?
 /edit
 Ok here is what i want to do:
 We have a monitoring system that can do rest calls. When the status of certain monitored asset changes i want it to send a rest call to my service. When all of the monitored assets are down, i want my service to shut down specific VMs through powercli.

                              <span>Those of you who use PAW-s, how do you manage them? 
 Admins have quite high privileges to servers. As Microsoft best practice suggests, their domain user (domain.com\admin) high privilege account which they use logging to PAW has no local Administrator privileges.
 Now there is situation when those same level/tier PAW-s need to be managed/administered by some of the same level admins. For example execute Powershell scripts on those PAW-s remotely, access ADMIN$ shares, etc... Looks like another domain user (domain.com\paw_admin) is needed for them which has to be inside domain group (domain.com\paw_administrators) which is member of local Administrators group. Nobody wants to have many MFA tokens.... Am I missing something?

 Mimecast is complaining about the &quot;Missing DKIM protocol version&quot;.
 Knowing from my past experiences how picky some SPAM-filters can be with such details, I would be happy to know, if I need inform or contact the Mailchimp support?
 Or is it good enough and only the first key has to have the version info?

                              <span>So it turns out our McAfee licenses expired over the christmas break and we all forgot to grab the latest removal tool (and helpfully I can&#x27;t even contact their support any more either). 
 Is anyone able to grab the latest version from their portal and share it with me as I just know trying to remove mcafee via ePO is going to fail on a number of PC&#x27;s and generally be a headache to clean up :)

                              <span>What is the difference between .com .net and .app domains ? 
 Which one is better and which one provides more stability ? 
 Also is google domains worth it ? 
 Does google brings some sort of application to edit the website or do I need to do it all by code ? 
 I worked with Joomla and it helps a lot to do the design.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Reaching out here as my Google-fu seems insufficient for getting my head wrapped why and how this is happening.
 We run RDS farms with RDGateway/RDBroker services. Recently we decided to decommission some of the older RDGW servers as they were unstable and poorly documented, and set up new ones.
 They work as expected, except for the fact that a handful of end users somehow have created full local user profiles on the new RDGW servers... It seems to be completely random, and it&#x27;s only about 8-10 accounts out of thousands that access the farms. The profiles are empty, and they have functioning/actual profiles on their respective collection session hosts. Creation date is between 0-4 days from when the new RDGW servers were put into production, and no new profiles have appeared since.
 Anyone know what could cause this? Any setting in user object and/or collection(s) that might trigger this behavior?
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 I am running an Ubuntu 20.04 VM with 16 cores as Graylog server (Java).
 The strange thing is, that the reported CPU usage of &quot;top&quot; is wrong.
 ​
 In Irix-mode:
 top - 08:22:05 up 13 min, 1 user, load average: 1.19, 0.73, 0.35 Tasks: 226 total, 1 running, 225 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie %Cpu(s): 0.3 us, 0.0 sy, 0.0 ni, 98.8 id, 0.1 wa, 0.0 hi, 0.0 si, 0.7 st MiB Mem : 15996.4 total, 11887.4 free, 3493.1 used, 615.9 buff/cache MiB Swap: 980.0 total, 980.0 free, 0.0 used. 12220.5 avail Mem PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 2659 graylog 20 0 16.0g 3.1g 45348 S 215.0 19.8 8:42.77 java 560 mongodb 20 0 1325640 114444 40564 S 2.7 0.7 0:18.67 mongod 120 root 20 0 0 0 0 I 0.3 0.0 0:00.12 kworker/0:2-events 234 root 20 0 0 0 0 I 0.3 0.0 0:00.03 kworker/11:1-mm_percpu_wq 2709 root 20 0 12204 4144 3340 R 0.3 0.0 0:00.31 top 1 root 20 0 168852 12440 8440 S 0.0 0.1 0:02.49 systemd 
 --&gt; 2,1 cores at 100%, but total usage only 1,2%
 At 16 cores, it should be around 13%
 ​
 Do you have any idea about the origin of that difference?
 Thank you and best wishes

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 I hope that everyone has a good new year.
 I was wondering If I could get feedback from the community about my resume.
 Currently I&#x27;m looking for a remote Linux sysadmin or possible a junior DevOps position in Europe.
  
I am currently getting my CKS and an AWS certificate. Should I put them in my resume and saying that I&#x27;m currently pursuing them or would you advice not to?
 I spoke with a recruiter and he said that my projects are not &quot;mature&quot; enough, I asked for feedback but didn&#x27;t hear anything back. What would be considered a &quot;mature&quot; project in your eyes?
 Did I list to many projects? I have a portfolio but I noticed that no one was looking on it.
 Would you think I could get a remote job in the United States as a 1099 contractor or is that to early?
  
Again, thank you for your input!

                              <span>Hi, I have a but of a mystery regarding my network, where devices in my network are not capable of accessing a web service which is outside the network, on port 80/443. The service is otherwise reachable from everywhere else (my home network, LTE, etc.).
 The network has 1000 IP&#x27;s on the same subnet and all devices in the network are behind a Debian firewall running iptables. All outgoing traffic is allowed and likewise for established connections.
 In particular, I have no problem reaching other instances of the same service on those ports from devices in the network. To my knowledge there is no iptables rule that precludes accessing the web service from my network.
 When I run tcptraceroute from a device within network, the tail of the trace is identical to running it from a device outside of the network with the exception that the last hop to the server with the web service is missing. To me this points to the packet being dropped by the server.
 Does this point to a misconfigured iptables on my end or could the problem be that the packets are rejected by the server running the web service when it belongs to my IP range? Everything has worked fine until recently. Port scan shows it runs IIS and only ports among top 1000 that are open are 80 and 443.

There are other projects related to moving on to the cloud, and different moving parts at the same time.
 Usually out of dozens or hundreds of emails, someone in huge thread will add me to the project in where my input is needed. At this point I&#x27;m not even sure what they&#x27;re talking about or sometimes I miss the email because I&#x27;m receiving so many and the title or top email has barely to do or details about what they need.

                              <span>I work for a school system, and foolishly installed the December updates before I left for Christmas break. I didn&#x27;t notice any issues immediately, and honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if the updates are even related.
 I run Windows 2022 Server on Dell hardware. I have 3 Hyper-V VMs on that. A domain controller that does DHCP and DNS, a storage server, and a &quot;support&quot; system that I use for troubleshooting. The support system will not get a DHCP address from the server, which is connected to the same virtual switch.
 I read about the issues with the Dec update and Hyper-V, but I thought it was for newly created VMs. I went ahead and applied the OOB patch to the host anyways, but no luck. I then uninstalled the updates, no luck. I had DHCP failover setup, so I removed that, no luck. Thinking that maybe something with my scopes was corrupted, I loaded a backup, no luck.
 The odd thing is that the server gets the request, assigns an IP, which shows up in the leases, but the support system never receives the IP. I do have firewall enabled on the server, but outbound shouldn&#x27;t be blocked. I can use our Meraki switches to give out DHCP addresses, and the support system gets that with no issue. I can ping the DHCP server if I set an IP on the support system. I have 11 servers, 9 of them appear to have this issue, but all were updated at the same time (I think the other two are working, but haven&#x27;t worried about those until I figure the others out). I actually may have fixed one of them, doing the above...but doing the same to another server didn&#x27;t help. So I&#x27;m thinking it was a fluke, or I didn&#x27;t find the right combo.
 I&#x27;m hoping someone has seen something similar, and can point me in the right direction.
 Thanks

 I’m looking for one that can comprehend DNSSEC (!!) and provides a customer tool to upload/submit delegation signer (DS) records to the appropriate top level domain.
 Heard good things about Namecheap.

                              <span>What is everyone doing for users that get new phones out of the blue? For the most part I have them contact me as soon as they can, I log into Azure and then re-require enrollment for an auth app. I will also delete their old auth app entries to prevent confusion. I believe there is a way for users to receiver their account via the auth app but from what I think, it’s only for Microsoft accounts and not third party.

                              <span>Man today in Target I heard a phone ringing with an old Nokia ringtone that I use to use for an on-call phone almost a decade ago. My brain instantly went to &quot;Dammit I don&#x27;t want to deal with this.&quot;
 That was one of the worst stretches of on-call I ever had, it was with a mid-sized company that had a shit infrastructure and poor management that was always in react mode and slapping bandaids on everything instead of fixing it. I wasn&#x27;t even a sysadmin there, but my jobs would get impacted every time they had an outage that would have me spending a couple of hours figuring out what data was janked up. That was also the shortest stint of any job I worked, in and out in less than a year but I was called after hours every freaking week.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got 30 Dell laptops sitting in my house. Need to set them up and ship them out to field workers. Basically install Office and a few utilities, and not much more than that. I have no access to a server or a network. I have a USB drive.
 I could sit here an go through the manual Windows setup and then download Office and those utilities, etc. But was hoping there was some way to do this like used to be possible back in the Ghost/Macrium/Clonezilla days. Set up one of the machines, capture that to a USB drive, use that drive to image the other 29 machines.
 I know SCCM and MDT and WDS are the cool ways to do this now, but wondering if there is a recommended non-network, non-server way of accomplishing this. FOG maybe?

                              <span>Hi,
 When you see a DKIM signing, you see a that a particular domain has signed the email.
 However, from where the domain in the “d&#x3D;“ is taken from? 
 Is it like the SPF, which points to the Return-Path domain?(envelope from(SMTP Mail From)? 
 Or the domain in the d&#x3D; can be taken from the “Header From” as well? Though it would not make any sense because then every domain that will be attempted to spoof, we see it’s DKIM signature.
 So whenever a message has been signed with a DKIM of a particular domain, and let’s say that the DKIM header was not “added” by forging, it means that I can stay “calm” and realise that it was really sent from a valid domain because it means the return path is that domain?
 (Not including BEC)
 I know what DKIM does, I just wanted to know where that domain in the d&#x3D; comes from exactly.
 Thank you

 My family&#x27;s company has been around for nearly 40 years. We are very old-school when it comes to technology. I want to change that, but only if it actually helps us.
 The following processes could benefit from ERP:
  
Estimating/Quoting
 Purchase Order creation
 Receving
 Raw material inventory
 Part inventory
 Order review/confirmation
 Order history (for future job knowledge &amp; estimating)
 Work order/Job Card creation
 Invoicing
  
Many of those processes are fine as is, but we have the issue of information not being communicated between processes. For example, my work order system does not communicate with part inventory or raw material inventory. If I allocate material to a …</span>

 Any ideas?

                              <span>Coming into a new work environment and I noticed that first user logon takes about 4-5 minutes.
 I turned on Windows logon verbose logs and I noticed that the &quot;Apply Group Policy Registries&quot; step would take the most time to complete.
 ​
 GPOs were created originally by a third party. 
 Looking at the GPOs, I see that the third party created 100+ registry items which I assume is the culprit. These are all user policies.
 Examples of Registry items that are being deployed via GPO:
 (Note: 95% of these GPOs are set to run Apply One and do not reapply)
 Windows Icon Size
 Startup Page
 TaskbarAnnimations
 ​
 My thinking is to write a powershell script or create a .REG file and import these settings into the Default User registry Hive to save time.
  
Is this (manually adding the registries to the default user) the best approach to mitigate the slow logon time caused by lots of GPO registry items
 If I manually make these changes (powershell, .REG), and still keep the GPO Registry items, will the group policies see that the key, item already exists and skip the step, or will it just continue to run and apply the registries (write over my work)?

                              <span>This probably isn&#x27;t a true /r/sysadmin worthy request ... but I&#x27;m hoping another admin has run into this before.
 Long background exists but the short story is that the former owner of the company was allowed to keep his company email for a lot longer than it should have been allowed. As a result he is now an over 70 year old gentleman and dependent on everything remaining as close to the same as possible. We have multiple insurance/regulatory/compliance requirements that say we need him migrated off ASAP. Current mailbox is in on-prem exchange ... size is roughly 15gb.
 My original plan was to have him get a gmail address, export his mailbox to a PST file and ship it to him to use inside Outlook. He flipped out that he wouldn&#x27;t have his *extensive* folder organization system available on all his PCs/mobile devices like he does now. Current owner wants me to find a solution that would make it work with the least amount of friction possible.
 So thats the backstory ... now to solutions ... I&#x27;m open to anything that gets this resolved with the least amount of a 70 year old swearing at me and my helpdesk tech. 
 Can we upload his PST file into Office 365 Business either manually or through some wizard? Even just folder copying for him if need be.
 Any slicker solution you can think of?

                              <span>We have lots of used monitors and laptops that we want to offer to our employees before selling it outside the company. What would be the best way to manage it? I don&#x27;t think that at the current scale I will be able to manage it via emails and excel. I was thinking about some kind of marketplace, preferably self-hosted, where people will be able to browse and place reservations/request desired pieces of equipment. Do you guys know something like that? Anyone did something similar?

                              <span>A bit of history. About 30 years ago a colleague showed me a printout of Real Programmers don&#x27;t eat quiche - a rather amusing little introduction to our merry world. I&#x27;ve been meaning to do this for years, but I bastardized it for SysAdmins and bought it up to date. Hope you enjoy it!
 ​
 Real SysAdmins don&#x27;t eat quiche. They like Twinkies, Coke, and palate-scorching Szechwan food.
 Real SysAdmins don&#x27;t write application programs. They program right down to the base-metal. Application programming is for dullards who can&#x27;t do automation.
 Real SysAdmins don&#x27;t write specs. Users should be grateful for whatever they get; they are lucky to get support at all.
 Real SysAdmins don&#x27;t comment their scripts. If it was hard to write, it should be even harder to understand and modify.

 Reason for switching is due to cost - very expensive for our needs. Looking for something similar to Zendesk with good reporting tools and automation.
 Zoho seems to be the best bet as it looks like a complete clone, even coming with an import function for Zendesk.
 Freskdesk is another one I keep hearing about.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a problem with the delegation of mailboxes. 
 Many times in the new admin center when delegating an email box to a user, I give access to the user, the service says it may take up to 5min but the fact is that the box does not appear in the user&#x27;s Outlook and if I go back to the delegation part the access does not appear, as if it was never given.
 However, in the classic version of Exchange (ECP), the access appears as given. This has been happening for a few months now with some mailboxes, but there isn&#x27;t exactly a pattern.
 Does anyone have any idea what it could be?
 Thanks!

                              <span>We are a small linux shop, but unfortunately we have one proprietary application with an SQL Server on a windows box. This box sometimes has problems but unless someone logs into the machine remotely and pulls up EventViewer we don&#x27;t get notified. We don&#x27;t have a dedicated monitoring system, just some cron jobs which send out email.
 I looked into various tools but nothing really convinced me. I have only basic requirements right now: get windows events, filter out the few we&#x27;re interested in from the application, and make them available, e.g. a CSV file on a share.
 Recommendations for this scenario greatly appreciated.
 And have a happy new year!

 In the next step i am running HPIA silently to install all CRITICAL components - which is working fine as well.
 At that point i am wondering if i oversee something or if the CLI options offer less then the UI of HPIA.
 UI
 In the UI i can select for example a subset of:
  
CRITICAL
 UPDATE RECOMMENDED
 INSTALL RECOMMENDED
 ...
  
While i would like to have:
  
CRITICAL 
 UPDATE RECOMMENDED
  
but not
  
INSTALL RECOMMENDED
  
simply to avoid bloatware being added. So in the UI i can select fine-tuned what to do.
 ​
 CLI
 In the cli manual (http://ftp.ext.hp.com//pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/whitepapers/HPIAUserGuide.pdf) i can only find the following
  
ALL
 CRITICAL
 RECOMMENDED
 ROUTINE
  
so no way to differenciate between
  
UPDATE RECOMMENDED
 INSTALL RECOMMENDED
  
Am i reading it wrong or is the CLI offering less then the UI?

                              <span>I know that answer is somewhere inside megathread, but I can&#x27;t find it. We have some 2003 boxes (several legacy apps), so I am worried about them. We do not applied November updates, and it is time to install December. As I understood, the way to make 2003 work is to create DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes registry key with one of values 0x1F, 0x1C, 0x3F
 So, I spinned a lab for a test, and there are some problems:
  
after update install, access to 2003 share by name was lost (expected). RDP login is working. Hosted application works.
 after settings DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes to one of values 0x3F, 0x1F, 0x1C login to server breaks. Both RDP and console login. 
  
It only works with default value 0x27. 
 Have anyone experienced with 2003 ? Have I missed something?

 We use Known Folder Redirection for users to OeDrive. It&#x27;s deployed via Intune. No issues with it. Looking at the cyber insurance things and they want endpoint backup of every machine.
 Should I just stick with Known Folder Direction or should I look at something else such as Acronis Cloud or something

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to discuss Azure Pass-through authentication. 
 My understanding is that:
 a) All password validation requests are sent to Windows Server Active Directory via Pass-through authentication, and Active Directory is the actual place where auth occurs. So, with this in place, I could run scripts against Active Directory to look for dormant/inactive user accounts that have not be used for x days, and have them removed afterwards 
 b) For AAD Guest accounts, the identity provider, or authentication system would be Azure Active Directory 
 Are my assumptions correct?

                              <span>I want to create a JWT token once username and password is validated in RDS DB.
 I also want to validate the JWT token once client sends.
 Do I need to create API for this ? Which language is suitable for creating and validating JWT token ?

                              <span>A customer of ours hosts a lot websites and databases in our datacenter. These websites normally get accessed using a vpn for safety reasons. Said customer also hosts similar websites on-prem for testing. They would like to acces the test server without using the vpn. But they also dont wont to open any ports on the server. So a tunnel it is. What would be the best way to tunnel that data? Ideally I would be able to limit acces to certain ips.

                              <span>Looking at ways of increasing security, how would you build a jump host these days?
 We have an existing 2016 box we are going to retire. It&#x27;s within one of our own networks in another region. It employs most of the STIG rules. It is domain joined.
 We use this for:
  
Jumping into routers
 Jumping into restricted VMs/Infra
  
With the new host, I have a couple of questions:
  
We&#x27;re looking to move it to Azure so if anything in our network is compromised, we still have the jumphost for admin functions
 Domain joined or not to be domain joined - just becomes a headache around administering it
  
Any other suggestions you have would be welcomed.

 I&#x27;ve been in IT for about 25 years, I am thoroughly a Generalist, but the last 15 years has been SysAdmin / IT Manager with maybe 15% time in the field- racking new gear, replace a few AP&#x27;s, pull a few Cat 6 drops. I&#x27;ve done maybe 1000 terminations in my time. So I don&#x27;t consider myself an expert when it comes to structured cabling and termination.
 I am preparing to help a church do a network reset and need some advice on some particulars. Up until a couple months ago I would not have told you that I had a preferred brand of Cat5e / Cat6 keystone jack, but on that job I had to terminate a dozen Cat 6 cables to jacks and was provided Panduit brand jacks. I felt like they were easier for me to terminate than anything I had used before.
 With that being said I wonder if you experienced folks have a preferred brand or model of jack? I estimate there will be around 150 keystone terminations to do with the church job, and I will be installing these into modular (blank) patch panels.
 I would like to try out the JackRapid tool, and see that it has versions for many different jacks, anyone have good or terrible experience with the tool itself? 
 Does anyone know the practical differences between Leviton 5g108 vs 5g110? 
 Is there any reason to consider Cat5e these days or should I just go straight to Cat6? Is there a cable brand that is preferred, with regards to colors being clear and easy to see, cable not too bulky, etc?
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>We rent a suite in a 2 story office building in the Portland area. Our building doors are unlocked between 6am and at least 6pm each day. Our suites can be locked up though any time we want. In the common area of the building on the second floor is a wall for bikes and on one wall is all the ISP demarc equipment for all the tenant. Since we opened our office back up this has been a massive red flag to me since we have had homeless people barricade themselves in the bathrooms of our building. It would be quite easy for someone to just disconnect, break, or steal the equipment on the wall, nothing is locked in any enclosed racks. 
 I&#x27;m writing our building management about this problem and telling them these are my concerns but are there any building codes, or legal requirements to put this equipment in a room that&#x27;s access controlled or at least locked enclosures so it&#x27;s not just exposed to anyone walking down our halls I can use to back up my concerns?

                              <span>If this rule is used
 -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate DNAT -j ACCEPT
 it means that it accepts packets that have had their destination address updated by the NAT, but im confused about when the NAT updates the destination address.
 Say this is the NAT table:
 NATed Address NAT-host Address Destination Address 192.168.1.2:53452 x.x.x.x:53452 8.8.8.8:53 
 the x.x.x.x would be the public address of the NAT router.
 So if the NAT receives a packet with destination x.x.x.x:53452, does it ONLY update the destination IF the source address of the packet is 8.8.8.8:53? What if its 8.8.8.8:2000? What if its 1.2.3.4:8000, but still destined for x.x.x.x:53452?

By the way, I&#x27;m 25 years old. That school is only teaching programming. I&#x27;m pretty good at JavaScript and am starting to learn python now.
 My dyslexia and dyscalculia have made programming very challenging. Still, I&#x27;m now pretty good ( not close to job-ready) at it, but I&#x27;m interested in learning cybersecurity. I&#x27;m not a native English speaker, and if I&#x27;m reading something for English text, I&#x27;m using like 80% screen reader. My dyslexia is very severe.I understand that because of these learning disabilities, I will never be a very competitive programmer in the job market. I&#x27;m okay with that.

                              <span>Hi! I would like to add an external microphone to a security camera. To do so I need 12V to power the microphone and POE for the camera. I can&#x27;t seems to find a POE splitter that can both output 12V while carrying the poe to the camera. Essentially, I am looking for a device like this but with POE pass thru, is that a thing? Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys
 I work for a large company with a not so huge corporate network footprint. It&#x27;s not medical, it&#x27;s not government. But they have to work or we potentially lose a ton of money. We manage about 8 FortiGate firewalls in our realm and I just do not see eye to eye with the other engineer.
 So this persons process is this: We have 6 versions to go through to get the version we want. These are important firewalls as far as our traffic flow goes and all have HA redundancy.
 The engineer will backup and compare configs and run tests after each firmware update. That means 6 times we do this to ONE firewall before we reach the version we want. 48 times all together for the whole network.
 On each incremental update we test all functionality, then let it &quot;run&quot; like that for a day or two, fill out a checks form then upload our configs then do it again for the next incremental update.
 Am I losing my mind here? Why are we not doing incremental upgrade, run a config comparison then upgrade to the next until we are done and then do our final checks on the final revision. It would take an hour instead of a week. Am I being too relaxed? I&#x27;ve probably upgraded thousands of these things in my life but this is the first time I seen someone do this so manually and labor intensive and slow. Everything this person does is done manually with a mouse and a gui.
 How would you handle this knowing a zero day vulnerability has been exposed? Does anyone do it to this tedious of a process?
 Open to convo and opinions on the process. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve disagreed but I want to hear your experience be it fortigate or Cisco or whatever.

                              <span>So if a company has a site-to-site VPN over the internet, it&#x27;s going to be encrypted, obviously... but why is it that this has not usually been the case for MPLS? In either situation, traffic will be traversing through a third party&#x27;s network (a service provider)... and isn&#x27;t the whole idea that you don&#x27;t want these third parties to be able to see/alter your traffic?
 The internet would pose a greater risk, of course (with traffic traversing many different service providers as opposed to just one... potential for BGP shenanigans too)... but, the risk still seems to be there with MPLS.

 We need to Upgrade our DDoS Defences due to compliance.
 We are publishing several Websites (7) and a few custom services for people working at the customer. 
 ​
 Requirements are pretty low. Easy to handle would be nice. 
 We requested DDoS Protection on ISP Site and we would pay roughly 1k/month and I have no Idea how reliable that can be. 
 ​
 What do you guys use ? and how do I Implement that in our current Topology ?
 &gt; Does the DDoS Applicance hold all Public IP Adresses and do I need to use it as a reverse Proxy ? or is it all transparent ?
 &gt; What do you guys think about Cloudflare or other similiar Cloud Services ?
 &gt; What Vendors could you suggest otherwise ?

 A main Mikrotik1 is connected by SFP to another Mikrotik2 that would act as the core equipment of the fibers, on the SFP1 of the Mikrotik1 6 VLANs are created.
 In the Mikrotik2 all the SFP ports are on a bridge, within the bridge created 1 VLAN to manage my equipment, then a DHCP Client on the VLan to obtain an IP from the Mikrotik1, it takes the IP all right.
 Now, I connect the TP-Link Omada to the Mikrotik2, there is a link through the SFP port but I can&#x27;t get it to take IP, normally if you connect something else via ethernet that has DHCP Server it takes the IP automatically.
 Has anyone had experience implementing VLAN Mikrotik + TP-Link?

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with architecting an SD WAN appliance that supports bonding, automatic failover, and use of GPS location to dynamically enable/disable a WAN connection.
 The basic requirement is for the system to support up to four gigabit WAN connections and disable one or more based on GPS location. The stretch goal is for the same device to support Multipath TCP so that traffic can be routed over multiple WAN links and recombined at a cloud server.
 The purpose is for a system installed in a vehicle that can leverage multiple different WAN links (5G, Starlink, Wi-Fi) to maximize bandwidth, provide seamless failover, and disable certain WAN links (Starlink and/or 5G) when operating in areas where the service is unavailable or not approved for use.
 I have prototyped these technologies individually using a Linux PC, but I need to find a reliable hardware + software platform for a production industrial grade system. If you were tasked with such a project, what platform would you chose to build it on?

                              <span>In a firewall you have a routing table and a policy. The routing table is used to determine what traffic goes to what next-hop IP-address or interface, and a policy is used to specify what traffic is allowed through the firewall. 
 Now a colleague of mine has come up with the idea to start using policy-based routes instead or normal routes as an extra layer of security. The idea is to use policy-based routes to specify which sources (subnets or interfaces) are routed to specific networks. His argumentation is that if you make a mistake in the firewall policy and accidentally allow too much traffic, the PBR rules will prevent the traffic to being routed to the addresses it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to reach. 
 This to me sounds like a really bad idea, and makes an already complex network more overly complex. I have never seen PBR being (mis)used for something like this. What are your thoughts about this and using PBR as a security measure instead of a tool for traffic flow management?

                              <span>I came across a prominent US fast food chain who was running mojo wireless in their stores, which is now Arista. So that got me thinking about Arista&#x27;s campus offering and how mature their wireless offering is.
 Do any of you folks have experience with Mojo? How far has it come along since the Arista acquisition?
 I know there are the big players like Aruba and Juniper Mist, but the thought of a cloud vision managed VXLAN campus + wifi is intriguing to me. Arista seems to be the best folks to do it, given their roots in DC networking. 
 PS (I&#x27;m not even going to entertain the thought of a N9K ACI fabric or a Cisco DNA campus lol)

                              <span>TLDR: I have limited upload bandwidth (25mbps) almost all of which is needed for a live stream. When another device starts using a lot of bandwidth the stream starts dropping. The equipment I have to manage this is a Comcast modem, Linksys LRT224 VPN router, Linksys LGS318P Smart Switch
 Happy New Year!
 Background I run a live stream (and am just the general IT guy) for an aquatic facility. We have 250/25mbps internet through Comcast which unofficially runs closer to 300/30. We also have a 4K/60 live stream which YouTube recommends a minimum bandwidth of 20mbps for 4K/60. Most of the time it works great with no dropped packets, but there are times where packets just start dropping like crazy which I think I have to attribute to someone else using bandwidth.

Just FYI I have some expert level certs in R&amp;S + SP, I just don&#x27;t want to get into details why I&#x27;m stepping down. They are deeply personal. 
 I am dressing down my resume and just looking for a job where I can keep my head down and coast with minimal supervision from my boss. I stumbled across some jobs in health care provider world. 
 Do you guys have any insights into what day to day network engineering roles in health care look like? Looking for first hand accounts of what the job role is like in a mid to senior level role.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure there are many on this sub using these &quot;small business&quot; switches. They&#x27;re full featured, good value for money, have lifetime warranty and, most importantly, are actually shipping!
 The problem is, when you have about 100 of these switches (mix of SG300, SG350 and the new CBS350 of various sizes and PoE/non-PoE) and they all need pretty much the same configuration save for some special use access ports..... do you guys/gals use any special tools to bulk configure them?
 I&#x27;ve done some crude automation with DHCP Options / TFTP and a gold config file, but once you need to start tweaking the individual switch it all goes manual.
 And please don&#x27;t ask me to use FindIT, or Cisco Business Dashboard, or PNP, or whatever half-baked tool Cisco decides to stick into these switches... I&#x27;d like something where I take a switch out of the box, stick it in the network, it gets autodiscovered then I can configure it and maintain it almost entirely in bulk.
 EDIT 1: I already have the initial config sorted. Like I said I can do it with a golden config file, DHCP Options and TFTP. This is fine. My question is about follow up config changes, monitoring, config backups, and individual port configurations.
 EDIT 2: Basically I’m looking for a “WiFi controller for switches” for these models. Aruba, Ruckus, Cisco Catalyst, Cambium, Meraki - they all have some form of centralised controller… I’m looking for something similar for these switch models.

                              <span>Trying to help a company set up a voice VLAN to help with RingCentral issues and I&#x27;m having no luck getting VLANs to work.
 At this point I&#x27;d like to start from scratch and work my way up as I can&#x27;t even get a simple data VLAN working correctly.
 Here&#x27;s what I would like to do to start.
 There is a Sonicwall TZ370 firewall (acting as router) and a D-Link DGS-1100 switch. Modem plugs into X1 WAN port on SW. X0 Lan port on SW is plugged into port 1 on switch.
 The main company network is 192.168.1.1
 I would like to create a Data VLAN 20 at 192.168.20.1 which assigns IP address in that range when plugged into port 7 of the switch
 I have create a virtual interface in the Sonicwall (X0:V20) and assigned it 192.168.20.1 and set up a DHCP lease range, 192.168.20.2-254
 In the switch there is a default VLAN0001 with all 24 ports untagged, Native VLAN (PVID) checked, and all ports set to hybrid.
 I created a VLAN 20 Data. Here&#x27;s where I get confused. What do I set port 7 as? I have tried all options. 
 When I select tagged or untagged, Internet works but I still have 192.168.1.1 address. Not sure what I&#x27;m missing.
 Any ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>So system disk is 100% full: Usage of /: 100.0% of 77.35GB 
 Before knowing this, I did a &quot;reset root password&quot; from digital ocean&#x27;s droplet control panel. So now when I go to SSH, it will ask me to enter current password twice, and then new password twice. However, that produces an error and it will never save because the disk is full. I then go into Recovery Console, and that also does not save the new password because I am assuming the disk is full also.
 With not being able to login via SSH with any method, I am not sure how I can clear some of the system disk. Can anyone help me with this?

                              <span>I started out doing Windows NT/2000 admin support in 2000-2006 before accidentally getting into data analytics and AI stuff (it was part of my thesis in graduate school). That stuff was fun and all but after 15 years it&#x27;s pretty much ran it&#x27;s course and it&#x27;s time for a new position. 
 I&#x27;m well aware of DevOps, bizops, secops, and other ops buzzwords but I really don&#x27;t want to write anymore code and not too interested in management. 
 So I&#x27;m curious does the traditional sysadmin still exist? The positions supporting the OS or is that all pretty much automated now? Or considered entry level work?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have 2x Dell PowerEdge R740 (just 1 year old) with Seagate HDDs (DL2400mm0159, SAS 10K 2.4TB) with RAID-5 (1 hot spare) configuration.
 Past few months, I&#x27;ve been experiencing multiple disk failures. Since Oct 2022, so far at least 10 disk failures on two different servers. 5 disk failures on each server..
 I replaced disks (when it failed), physically replaced PERC H750 RAID Controller, upgraded firmware of HDD &amp; BIOS as well but disk failure has been happening randomly on different slots and today another one just failed. Dell Tech support says they do not perform any root cause analysis of HDD failure and does not provide me with any reason for this massive failure. 
 Any idea why disks keep failing?

I called a meeting as they were telling me I had integrate Workday with Active Directory and needed some information. He kept saying everything was fine and they didn’t need to bring us in quite yet. I was pushing to get someone to actually own the project and manage it and he kept pushing back and got really angry when I mentioned that I wasn’t a project manager but had a PMP certification and new enough to know we needed project management on this massive migration. Turns out he didn’t have his PMP and thought I made him look bad. Grudge unlocked.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a software that seems like it should exist, but I have not been able to find it and I&#x27;m not quite sure what to search for.
 My company has tens of thousands of photos, dating back decades, scattered across local file servers, SharePoint sites, and Box accounts. After reorganization attempts from several marketing people, it has gotten to the point where people can rarely find the photos they are looking for if they don&#x27;t already know exactly where to look.
 I&#x27;m looking for software that will scan the media in its existing location and build a searchable database based on the file&#x27;s metadata. Ideally it could use AI to allow users to search for subject matter. I would also like it to allow things like tagging, rating, and favoriting media.
 In my searching, I have come across Digital Asset Management software, but I&#x27;m struggling to get my head wrapped around what they actually do. It seems like they are trying to be more of a wholesale replacement for a file share, but I can&#x27;t really tell.
 Any advice on if software like this exists or on best practices for managing a large media catalogue with multiple users and contributors.

 It&#x27;s my first time posting here and I hope this is the correct subreddit. I came here for advice or direction regarding the project I took upon.
 I am part of a community center/organization where we mainly teach children and students programming, fabrication, and such and we have multiple locations, some with multiple classrooms and public areas equipped with computers. The number of computers ranges from 2-12 and we use laptops and desktop PCs with Windows and Linux operating systems (based on what software we want to run and what the computers can handle).
 Until now we didn&#x27;t do any pc management, imaging, or &#x27;freezing&#x27; of the system but it was all done manually trying to keep the computers in working order. But lately (because of our growth and increase in us…</span>

                              <span>Hi all! I’m a new sys admin at our company which is very cloud-focused and we’ll be inheriting an HPE server with Server 2019 and Hyper-V installed with 4 VMs on it. We’ll need to implement our own alerts to let us know if the Hypervisor or any of the VMs go offline. Something to note is that there is a plan in place to migrate these VMs to Azure or shut them down completely if we don’t need them within the next few months. So we’re looking for more of a cheap stopgap than anything. 
 I was thinking of setting up Azure connection monitoring to accomplish this since I see you can also monitor on premise machines. But if there’s something better available that fits this scenario, I will look into it. Thanks!

Where 2FA doesn&#x27;t allow authenticators, I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s better to just have an unlisted Google Voice number as the second factor. Do you think that this would be more or less secure than using cell phone, given the possibility of SIM swapping attacks and the ton of breaches like LastPass tying accounts to data?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an individual contributor at my organization. A previous manager and I had a conversation once about pursuing a Management position vs remaining an individual contributor (Admin/ Engineer/ developer etc...) position.
 ​
 Basically it boiled down to my manager saying that remaining in technical roles can be more rewarding than going into people management type positions. Siting that high level individual contributors have high salaries than management people. I find this hard to believe. From my perspective, no manager would ever make less than their direct reports because of the mindset &quot;They report to me, I&#x27;m high in the org chart, therefore I&#x27;m more valuable.&quot; 
 ​
 Difference between the roles aside, Is there any truth in this? Can any of the individual contributors out there confidently say their salary is higher than their manager? Was remaining a system admin more lucrative for you? For those that made the switch from an admin to a people manager, do you have direct reports that make more than you?

 Couple this with a form that HR fills out (lol I know, but it&#x27;s been working pretty well), some dynamic groups to assign licenses and you&#x27;re on your way to saving the IT department a lot of time spent on setting up accounts and fixing mistakes. 
 I&#x27;ve tried doing this with the &#x27;create user&#x27; step in Power Automate, and using PowerShell, this seems to be the most flexible way to do it.

                              <span>Hello,
 Long time lurker. I&#x27;ve been a Sys Admin for around 6 years. I started at a small law firm, then just last May started at an MSP. I&#x27;ve gathered knowledge just from facing different issues at hand, but I still feel like there&#x27;s a lot to learn. My question really is what paths are there for me to take to bring me to the next step/level in my career? As for my salary goal, is 160k out of the question? Or is that 10+ years away? Thank you for your input.

                              <span>In our local Makerspace different workshops are given, for this there are Windows laptops ( about 20), on which software is installed for the different courses (Arduino IDE, Cura, Fusion 360, etc.).
 What possibilities are there to automatically update the Windows laptops and install software (possibly centrally)?
 Is there a way that the laptops &quot;reset&quot; themselves after workshops and have the initial state (without user data)?
 ​
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>So in the new year I’ve decided I should improve the security for our Veeam Backup infrastructure by deploying a dedicated AD Domain just for the Veeam servers to live on. It got me thinking, should I also move vCenter authentication over to only using this new domain, should I point it to both domains, or should I leave it as it is on the production domain?
 Looking to minimise the chances of lateral movement within the network from bad actors by making sure compromised credentials from the production domain can’t be used to tamper / impact the backups. There’s already a bunch of physical servers acting as repositories / tape servers and a number of VMs acting as proxies and data movers(in addition to the Veeam Management VM), so adding an extra couple VMs hosted on the physical repository servers will maintain the physical separation.

 Border agents have the upper hand, you can be detained and your devices seized. Key disclosure laws make it legal to force you to surrender your passwords and biometric access. Back up your devices, use encrypted cloud storage, wipe and factory reset your device, create new travel accounts, restore your devices when you reach a safe network.

She had an old 19H2 build, and so I installed her a new one with 21H2. A few minutes later I get a phone call from her stating that Hyperlinks are not working on Outlook. I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it, but I did receive an error stating that there are no sufficient privileges, or something of the sort, I can&#x27;t recall the exact error. No worries, I went to Google and after a few minutes I was suggested to fix the registry htmlfile. I did that, and links opened again and all was well. Until a couple minutes later where I got another call from her stating that they &quot;still don&#x27;t work&quot;. I logged into her computer to investigate.

 What I want is for users to log in with their username / password, and then reach over and hit their FIDO key for mfa, as a faster/easier option than pulling out their phone. ..but then you have to put in another PIN, which is complete overkill.
 No point, just a gripe.

                              <span>I have gone over my hosting allocation limit for site visitors for the second month in a row. I only need traffic from my country (UK.) Will blocking all other countries with a plugin help with this? Can&#x27;t use Cloudflare blocking as hosting has its own CDN. I have WAF set up.

But resolution is completely broken and connection breaks. Same thing works fine when I run client on Android or Remmina on 22.04. I assume some package or codec is missing in 20.04.
 Here it is how it looks like:

 I moved in September and everyone seems to take their cyber security pretty seriously. I’ve just recently started using proton VPN and setup Apple’s iCloud private relay on safari. Are those good enough protect against network traffic monitoring?

                              <span>These past few years have been hectic to say the least. I have been trying my utmost to be available for email or messages 24/7 (unless on planned PTO). Recently started a new work with a much bigger team than my previous job. While discussing with my manager about plans for outages during the holiday, he said he’s not expecting to be able to reach me not anyone. They have a small team dedicated for such outages as first responders. 
 So this holiday has been the most quiet holidays I have had for the past half a decade. No email addressing to me. No server alerts. Nothing. Feel surreal. Gave me time to binge on a few anime I missed.
 With that said. Happy holidays and new year to everyone. For those that have to work, best of luck to you all!

                              <span>Hi all,
 So I have been thinking of doing a career change to System Administrator or Cloud Engineer/Architect and I&#x27;m wondering what my first steps should be. 
 I currently hold a bachelor&#x27;s in Aerospace Engineering and a master&#x27;s in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as a Systems Engineer (not IT Systems Engineer) in the defence sector where I do various work from designing to testing of naval military equipment. I have 2 years of experience after graduation. None of my work experience is related to System Admin or Cloud Engineering. 
 I have done some research and found that I should probably start with some of the certifications listed below: 
 Solutions Architect Associate
 Solutions Architect Pro
 Data Analytics Specialist
 Azure Fundamentals
 ​
 Will getting these certifications be enough to land a job at one of these positions? Should I do anything else to stand out? Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I recently started looking into roles similar to my own after being with the same company for nearly 15 years. When I was hired 15 years ago I never negotiated (didn&#x27;t have a lot of experience at the time) so every raise and promotion has been tied to my starting salary. My current salary, senior systems administrator, is $110k which for here in Ohio I&#x27;ve been happy with. However, after looking at very similar roles I&#x27;m seeing salaries of $120k - $135k. I don&#x27;t want to leave the company I work, it&#x27;s a great place to work, and the benefits are excellent. What&#x27;s making me look around is simply my salary which I believe may be a bit low considering my experience.
 The company I work for has a process for adjusting salaries based on the job market. I&#x27;m not sure how to approach my boss and do this dance. A raise of 20% would put me more in line with what I&#x27;m seeing from other job listings. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll need to bring in evidence to justify the pay raise but I&#x27;m not sure what sources would be best to use. Should I even bring a copy of the other job listing that shows the higher pay or would this be a mad move? I could wait to have a more concrete offer but I know that once that card is played you have to be prepared to leave if a counter offer doesn&#x27;t occur.
 Thank you

                              <span>We deploy Windows Updates via SCCM. However Windows 10 devices are still automatically updating drivers via some kind of side channel Windows Update process out of our control.
 We have had remote users lose network connectivity or lose audio and microphone functionality due to unexpected driver changes for the NICs and audio hardware.
 The fix has been to manually redeploy the working driver to their system. If it’s a network driver for a remote user and they can’t get back online, we have to ship them a replacement laptop and they lose days of work.
 Is there a setting to restrict drivers to the versions were have tested and are deploying?

                              <span>Long time listener first time poster . Sorry in advance if this is not the right sub.
 Background: I have to create a solution for auto certificate enrollment for IoT drives based on a locked version OpenSSL by the vendor. We are their first customer requesting 802.1x for nac port security but don&#x27;t have a preference on how to automate the enrollment /renewal of certificates. Right now it&#x27;s a very manual process. We use our own internal CA for laptops/desktops with GPO and AirWatch for company iPhones (6000+). Renewal period maybe 1year,2year or 5 year depending on the intermediate Issuing CA. 
 Does any one have any experience with this? I would also use this we future developments and axis cameras. There would be over 1000 devices to start and would increase over time so must be scalable. 
 Looking for some Pointers, would keyscaler solve this problem?

The length is obviously strong and is a nonsensical sentence, but in the end, the words are dictionary. MFA is setup and enforced.
  
If the data is truly offline and in the hands of the adversary, MFA is no longer in play, correct? There&#x27;s nothing online to authenticate against, so unless the MFA process salted the password somehow, I can&#x27;t …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping someone could help point me in the right direction. I&#x27;m looking to learn more about using MacOS in an enterprise environment. I&#x27;ve dealt with windows/linux my entire career and I&#x27;m curious how viable it it is to work with Mac&#x27;s.
 Please note I&#x27;ve used MacOS a total of about 1 hour in my life so pretty new to it. I&#x27;m assuming treating it like a Unix os is probably the safe bet. Any help from people currently administrating them would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s okay to ask this in this subreddit, but since I got a lot of information regarding testing new hard drives from here, I thought I give it a shot.
 I recently purchased two Seagate Expansion Desktops (16 TB each, the one I started testing with is a ST16000NM000J model) and did a little research to check if and how I should test my new storage devices, since I&#x27;m new to this whole topic (Windows 10).
 Here is what I came up with: https://pastebin.com/HHXPsEmu 
 If somebody wants to read and / or correct me - be my guest.
 Following my research, I wanted to do a Erase Test with HDDScan on the new drive as a first step, but it immediately started listing bad blocks and doesn&#x27;t stop to list them (SMART values were all okay) . Now I read on several links (Link1, Link2, Link3), that this probably is a failure of HDDScan. I tried 3 or 4 times, always starting HDDScan as admin, re-assigning the drive since it won&#x27;t get detected anymore after canceling the Erase Test, turned it on and off again, turned PC on and off again, nothing seems to work. 
 Is my drive just flatout broken, does HDDScan just don&#x27;t work correctly (what am I doing wrong?), is there a fix to this or what is the problem? 
 Is there any other way of doing a destructive read / write test on Windows to verify my drive, that this community recommends? I heard about badblocks, but I&#x27;m not in the mood to set up a Linux virtual machine just for this and I don&#x27;t want to upgrade to a Windows 11 Developer Build just to get a functioning mount-command for WSL.
 I didn&#x27;t test it with the other redundancy drive yet, but since this seems to be an error (or at least it seems to me), I did what any regular human being would do - frantically ask some dudes on reddit. I will test the other drive the following days and can update this thread, if necessary. Any help is appreciated &lt;3

 Update: To all the haters on me, I could care less about $120/month. We spend 10x that amount on lunch in a week. I was simply pointing this out that a 20% increase on anything in a year is alot. I&#x27;ll move to annual, get the payment reduced and move on.

                              <span>In light of the recent LastPass breech I looked at different strength test websites to see how long a password would hold up under a offline brute-force attack.
 The password I tried was: Aband0nedFairgr0und 
 This is a a 19 character password with a combination of uppercase/lowercase/numbers (no special characters) 
 I went to 5 different password strength sites and they all give me wildly different results for how long it would take to crack.
 ​
  
 https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ 9 quadrillion years 
  
 https://delinea.com/resources/password-strength-checker 36 quadrillion years 
  https://password.kaspersky.com/ 4 months 
  https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/ 1 day 
 
 As you can see the results are all over the place! 
 Can anyone recommend the best/ most upto date resource to check password strength. I am sure people with bitcoin mining farming GPUS can crunch 100s of guesses per second. 
 PS: Dont worry, Aband0nedFairgr0und is not a password I use and was made up as a test.

                              <span>I have a Mac Pro at home I use as a &quot;server&quot;. Sometimes when I am out traveling it could be useful to have access to the computer to manage download tasks or other desktop applications. 
 I have so far used Chrome Remote Desktop and TeamViewer, but would really like something that is just a process running in the background and neither Chrome Remote Desktop or TeamViewer does this. 
 My criteria is that this must be running in the background, allow unattended access, have a central/cloud based client list (so I don&#x27;t have to mess with VPN/DNS) and almost most important, be free or offer a free variant for both Windows and macOS.
 I only have two or three computers I need access to from my laptop, and sometimes from my iPhone.

                              <span>Hey Reddit
 So myself and, the Intune guy ( we are both new at a Company of around 2,000 users )We need to enable secure boot; not done at setup, but we have bios passwords, all different based on a company asset sticker.
 Yes, they do a few things backwards; I&#x27;m working on it :)
 I found some manufacturer Bios passwords, I wondered if anyone knows a lenovo one.I&#x27;ve tried these so far.
 https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000451.htm 
 My goal is to use the Lenovo, wmi commands to edit the setting, but you need to pass the bios password from there documentation.

                              <span>I have run into an install error that I have never encountered before and cannot figure out how to solve. Attempting to Google this is absolutely mind melting. I can only hope someone here is able to help solve is. 
 I have a company computer that I am not an admin on, nor do I manage the AD domain or policies. I do, however, access to the local admin account. I have one application only that is not installing properly and installs without issue on non domain computers.
 The error I receive is,
 &quot;This application requires a minimum of Internet Explorer 3.0 for this Operating System before installation. Please install minimum requirements and restart.
 The install will now abort.&quot;
 The machine I am on has IE 11, Edge, Chrome, and Opera GX. All of them are up to date and operational. Running as admin, disabling, re-enabling IE, booting to safe mode and forcing the installer, direct login as local admin, most everything you can think of does not solve this issue. 
 At this point I&#x27;m at a complete loss and don&#x27;t even know what else I can check. I&#x27;m not even sure what group policy could be effecting this. The local admin account is also part of the Administrators group. Any help is more than greatly appreciated.

 I&#x27;m looking for a solution to encrypt and password-protect my external hard drive, but which works across Android and Windows 11 because i use the ext hdd to backup my entire phone and my entire windows 11 partitions. I hope it makes sense what i mean is i can encrypt on Windows 11 and decrypt on Android and vice verca

 I realize some stuff is older than xp but those are outliers imo.
 Just curious from yall. And merry happy new hears.

 Please help! I&#x27;m so frustrated right now - I have work I need to do!
 A week ago I set up a non-password-protected share on a workgroup network from a server (windows 10 box). My other desktop can access that share just fine.
 Today I went to map that same drive to my laptop but it keeps saying I don&#x27;t have permission, check with the administrator. I can see the share in the explorer browser but I can&#x27;t browse into it - again same error. I&#x27;ve checked that the laptop is discoverable (on all the network profiles - which I really shouldn&#x27;t need to do) as well as turn off password-protected shares on the laptop (which I shoul…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been made a custodian for DNS servers at my Org as part of a migration and I&#x27;ve noticed that the RNAME in the SOA has been for many years wrong (e.g no MX records and the Email addresses are not valid). After doing some reading I found this absolutely a** whooping of a reply to a similar question in the NANOG Archives [1]. 
 My question to this sub is, do you maintain these role addresses [2] and monitor/reply to things sent to them? I&#x27;m not using this as a crowd-sourced way to shirk or excuse my responsibility. I&#x27;ll be trying my hardest to come up with a system that works for our team to maintain and monitor these role addresses. I guess for those who do it well, how are you doing it?
 This question extends not only to DNS but also to your IP Address space, the Domains you host, and any Email MTAs you run.

                              <span>Curious to know what tools you&#x27;re all using for network configuration management in automation. 
 The network I manage is not well connected (mobile units) and as such, many devices can be expected to be offline at one time. I&#x27;ve thought about using Ansible for pushing configuration changes, but given the high probability that a node is offline, I would have to develop intelligence that pushes until successful over an interval. This could get a little finicky. 
 I&#x27;m thinking of testing out a pull-based automation platform, but I don&#x27;t have any experience with them whatsoever. My Ansible experience is limited to laboratory environments. I&#x27;ve used Nornir to backup devices, but again, hit or miss depending on what&#x27;s online. I schedule this to occur once nightly at a time where I should have a decent success ratio. What would be easier? Having the configurations managed from a central automation platform and having the devices pull that down. 
 I don&#x27;t yet have a Single Source of Truth developed, but I am working on this. I came into the organization with phpIPAM as our IPAM tool. It doesn&#x27;t do DCIM very well whatsoever, so I&#x27;m wanting to move to something else (Infoblox, Bluecat, or NetBox if they&#x27;ll let me go FOSS again). Meanwhile, I&#x27;m shopping automation platforms.

                              <span>So a nice simple job turned into a bit of a nightmare with nothing working.
 In the cisco corner we have a 3750 with 3 vlans (1,2,20) and in the D-Link corner we have a 1510 with the same vlans configured. Should be simple to connect them, trunk port with 2,20 on the trunk and 1 as native, then on the D-Link side a hybrid port with 1 native untagged and 2 and 20 tagged.
 Nope only vlan that passes traffic is 1 (native), so we abandon that idea and setup an access port for 2 and another for 20,sfill no dice. Only mac address learnt was the port on the dlink.
 Checked the config on the dlink in cli, nothing odd at all really quite basic. Even withy everything broken out into access ports vlan 1 was the only one that passed traffic.
 So, any ideas on this one, as I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss how something that should have been simple just failed to work as expected.
 Cheers.

 I was wondering what is the difference between setting up an IP address on my laptop or any device and setting up a static IP in a unify controller?
 Thanks 👍

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a good sized DMVPN environment with approximately 100 spokes. One of these locations, happens to be my office.
 My office in this case, has 5 x WAN links, all of which today are VDSL-class 100Mbps lines.
 My ISR&#x27;s here, are 2951 HSEC+ K9 with the ISM accelerator.
 Performance is satisfactory for 100Mbps circuits, however there are some issues:
  
I am replacing the VDSL links with 3 x Fiber links, each of which is 1Gbps down, 100Mbps up.
 The machines are getting old, and my facility is the only one that must have aes256 tunnels, hence IOS &#x27;up2date&#x27; is very important here, the 2951 is now eol.
 If I can cut down on physical equipment I will be happy
  
Downstream of the ISR&#x27;s (dmvpn spokes) I use ASA5585-X&#x27;s with WAN traffic zones for load balancing. Each ISR has it&#x27;s own transit network with it&#x27;s own /29, and therefore the ASA sees each ISR&#x27;s downlink as a separate WAN
 All of this today, works very well, I could say that I&#x27;m very satisfied.
 However, with the new year coming, I need to make changes to match the new WAN links that are inbound.
 So, my question:
 Is it possible for me to purchase say a modern ASR, link 4, 5, say 6 WAN links to it directly (route to internet direct), and then with that single ASR, join my DMVPN cloud?
 Consider that the single ASR, will have a single serial number, hence a single certificate, and I&#x27;m trying to join DMVPN with a single ASR as &quot;multiple spokes&quot;
 The reason for this is that each WAN link needs to be encrypted by way of dmvpn, such that the transit downlink to the ASA is encrypted. The ASA knows only that he sees 4-5 WAN links, which are ultimately DMVPN spokes
 Thank you for any feedback

                              <span>I just set up our office network to authenticate with AD. My APs have access to few VLANs but 10 is management and 20 is our office. Even though I have my Cloudkey linking the network to the office VLAN when I connect to the wifi with my ad credentials the computer receives an address on VLAN10. Where do I begin, The machine hosting AD, Radis, IIS, CA &amp; NPS, and so on has access to the office and management VLAN. currently, the APs and NPS are communicating/authenticating over vlan10. since I don&#x27;t think that ubiquity issues multiple IP&#x27;s per app on each VLAN. Any recommendation is helpful.

                              <span>Just learned about passive/active BGP from a guy who said it basically only exists as a way to trip up exam takers. I then Googled thinking others would have the same question but the only link I found was to guy who asked about the point of active/passive BGP and got a response that explained how there can be a collision if two peers try to form a TCP connection simultaneously... unclear how TCP itself hasn&#x27;t overcome this but surely this isn&#x27;t the only reason. If it is, why wouldn&#x27;t setting active/passive be the norm?

 I know their outdoor WISP PTP/PTMP stuff is regarded very highly, but how are they viewed in the enterprise/MSP wired/WiFi space?

 Our core switch in our office is an Aruba 2930F. The access switches connected to it are all ruckus ICX 7150s. I am trying to add a tagged VLAN to one of the access switches. The core switch is running MSTP.
 I can tag the upstream port on the core switch for the relevant VLAN, but as soon as I tag the downstream port on the access switch, I lose connection to it and the core switch logs show that the port has been blocked by STP. 
 I have tried this twice for two different access switches, with two different VLANs, neither of which appear to be in a loop, as they are only conn…</span>

                              <span>Hi folks,
 In a hybrid cloud environment where you have your dedicated connection between the public cloud and on-premises (AWS DirectConnect, Azure ExpressRoute, Oracle FastConnect etc.) and:
  
The dedicated connection is provided by a third party service provider (not listed in the direct partner listing for the cloud provider)
 MACsec is NOT supported on your CPE
 You have to comply PCI-DSS, and you have your non-CDE communicating with your CDE over the dedicated connection
  
Do you encrypt the dedicated connection with IPsec? As in, is it normally required by PCI-DSS auditors in this case?
 P.s. Before anyone asks, no, I do not have contact with the auditors so I can&#x27;t ask them directly - they will be contracted by my client but that would be a few more months.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 ​
 I&#x27;m actually setting a lab to get some certifications (NSE4/CCNP).
 I actually have one VM ( 8 CPU / 64GB RAM) and running Eve-NG .
 ​
 Until now, everything was working fine. I was able to use Cisco images and FortiVM without anyproblem. 
 ​
 Now I want to test some layer 7 inspection and then I would like to set a Windows VM as a client. I followed the procedure from EVE-NG, everything is ok but when I start client (Windows on QEMU), it is too slow. I can use various ISO ( Win7 /10) the result is always the same. I can install Windows but then it is stuck on &quot;Windows is starting...&quot;
 ​
 I can even set 4 CPU and 8192 MB of RAM for the node, the result is the same...Any idea?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ll try and make this a clear without diagrams as possible.
 Currently labbing L3 down to the access layer utilizing OSPF in area 0. Everythings working with each access switch having two equal paths up to the internet. Happy days.
 I&#x27;ve had a play around disabling one of the links on the uplink switch so that only one link is now active. When running a constant ping from a pc on the access switch to 8.8.8.8 I get a loss of 3-4 packets. My understanding was that if both equal paths are in the routing table then theres no convergence and there should no loss.
 I&#x27;ve configured BFD which hasnt resolved. Could this be due to meusing ICMP and EVE NG as a test? Or something along the lines on the routing table not refreshing quick enough?
 I&#x27;d like to know your thoughts as this wouldn&#x27;t be a good scenario within a datacentre

                              <span>We have a simple setup at work with around 60 users:
 Router (1GbE) &gt; Switch 1 (L3, 10GbE) &gt; Switch 2 (L2, 1GbE)
 Using VLAN 1, 50 and 100.
 Our intention is to put a NAS (10GbE) and specific clients (10GbE) on VLAN50, all connected to the Switch 1. I just want to make sure, if we copy files between VLAN50 clients which are all on the same subnet and connected to the Switch 1, will traffic stay with the switch or also pass through the router and bottleneck the 10GbE requirement?
 If traffic does stay with the switch, would you still recommend us offloading the inter-VLAN routing by letting the Switch 1 be the gateway for VLAN50 instead of the router?

 I’m looking for something with a couple of gigabit Ethernet ports that will just pass traffic like a bridge. It’s only needed for some testing so I don’t want to rearchitect the network to include another router / firewall. 
 I’ve tried playing abound with a spare Cisco ASA in transparent mode, but it got way too complicated as there are several VLANs and IP ranges involved. 
 Functionally I’m thinking about something like a “tap”, but with the ability to export Netflow. 
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>When using VRRP to provide layer 3 first hop redundancy for layer 2 switches, is using proxy arp on the VRRP routers enough to ensure that port isolation isn&#x27;t broken? 
 The uplink ports of the layer 2 switches are connected to the VRRP routers.
 Multiple layer 2 switches will be connected to the VRRP routers. Normally I would put each layer 2 switch in a separate VLAN, but with VRRP this has the downside of wasting a large proportion of public IPv4 addresses in each subnet. Most switches have 24 or 48 port which do not align with subnet sizes.
 IP unnumbered would appear to be a solution to efficient use of IPv4 space, but I can find very little documentation about its use with VRRP. Well, other than information from Arista that it isn&#x27;t supported:

 Does anybody know if other vendors, such as Cisco or Juniper, support VRRP with IP unnumbered?
 Huawei has a concept called super-VLAN, which is similar to IP unnumbered and it supports VRRP. Is this my only choice, other than trusting port isolation and proxy arp or wasting a large percentage of my IPv4 space with subnets and VRRP?

                              <span>Hi everyone
 I am looking for someone who can design the whole network for my whole town with at least 300 outdoor boxes(2 x 8 splitter) in which I can provide 8 connections. I need all my boxes in rings so minimum downtime for my customers. I am from India if any local person can help me but I can take help from anyone who is willing to work on this project.
 Thankyou

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 For a corporate environment, what is everyone&#x27;s opinions on load balancers they have used and would recommend?
 ​
 I have used the following:
 -Netscaler
 -Loadbalancer.org
 ​
 Any other real world examples would be good.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I am looking to implement some external facing load balancers and after some experience from people using these in a corporate environment.
 ​
 My questions are people putting load balancers External to the Firewalls (prior) or have them sat within a DMZ?
 ​
 Ultimately I am looking down the Kemp route and moving away from Loadbalancer.org.

                              <span>So up until recently I worked for one of Fortinet’s competitors, and the general consensus (from our competitive intelligence team) was that Fortinet SD-WAN wasn’t truly up to snuff for a few reasons:
 (1) Supposedly, using ASICs in their hardware (as opposed to general x86 CPUs) means that customers have to rip and replace their appliances to get new functionality… I find this hard to believe, as aren’t their ASICS actually FPGA’s/programmable?
 (2) Lack of a “true” overlay… only VPNs with basic IP SLA’s attached. However… based on what research I’ve done, I don’t really see anything lacking in this area?
 (3) They require switches to sit in front of the appliances for HA… however, I understand that the newer branch models have built-in switches. Is this no longer a requirement?
 What’s your opinion? Was I fed lies / information that was no longer accurate? What’s the consensus on Fortinet SD-WAN?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been with my current employer for close to 10 years.
 Started as a PC tech and moved up to Sr Admin. It&#x27;s public sector so the pay isn&#x27;t great. I&#x27;m 60% remote with a 2hr round trip the other days.
 I love the work and the people but I&#x27;m at the ceiling, I&#x27;m at the last rung of the ladder unless my boss meets a meteor.
 And being local govt things don&#x27;t change so I&#x27;d be looking at the same thing for the next 3-4 years.
 Got called back about a position 15min away. Private sector hospice center. In office for a month then 40% remote. It&#x27;s not a Sr Admin but would be an increase putting me above what my current director is making.
 My main concerns are:
 They are VMware shop, my experience is with Xen/XCP, Proxmox and Nutanix.
 They are a Cisco shop, my experience is with Avaya/Extreme.
 But they looked at my resume and wanted to schedule an interview ASAP. Fingers crossed.

 Anyway, what’s your contingency plan (if any)? We’re new to it, our brilliant security officer picked it and now we’re suppose to upload our logins to this thing. I’ll probably cause some sort of IT drama if I decide to not follow along and be that guy.

                              <span>Hi all, looking for some help here and can&#x27;t seem to find the right words to Google it.
 I just finished a web application that requires Google chrome and a specific extension to run. The point of this application is for customers to schedule their own appointments in our system. Boss wants to have a PC set up on location for the customers to utilize this app, so I need to get this PC (that is running normal Win11 Home) locked down.
 What I mean by locked down:
  
The PC should only allow chome to be opened in full screen, and only the application&#x27;s url allowed. (All other web traffic should be blocked)
 
Users should be unable to launch any other programs (i.e. file explorer, cmd, start menu etc.). Ideally, they wouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to exit chrome&#x27;s full screen mode or get back to the desktop
 
Disabling keyboard shortcuts (Win+R, Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, etc.) 
 
 I&#x27;m sure this is a pretty common use case for PC&#x27;s, so the answer has to exist, but I can&#x27;t seem to find the right words to Google to start figuring out how to set it up. Just a bunch of chrome troubleshooting. Appreciate any advice or references to articles that would give me a push in the right direction.
 Edit 1: Thank you everyone for reminding me that &quot;Kiosk&quot; is a word. That&#x27;s definitely what I&#x27;m looking for. The limitations by not allowing extensions is bothersome, but I might be able to reconfigure the app for Firefox.

                              <span>I have setup the same SSID at multiple sites with WPA Enterprise 3. It seems that clients are having a hard time auto connecting to each one. One location directly has the Radius Server using a Synology NAS and the other site is using Unifi Site to Site VPN (OpenVPN ) Tunnel to connect to the Radius Server to use for Wifi. Is it possible to do this or will they have to forget the network and have to manually connect each time? Was just wanting to try to make it an easy connection when having multiple sites using the same SSID and config.

 Back to my question, what imaging tools have worked well for you, and which should I steer clear of?
 For context, we&#x27;re a Microsoft shop of ~150 users and have a small in-house IT &amp; systems team for BAU &amp; project support.
 I&#x27;ve been setting up new machines manually up until now - never been a problem as I only needed to build 1 or 2 machines at a time, and in the last year, I&#x27;ve probably set up ~30 devices - but I&#x27;d like to start doing it smarter and more consistently.
 We have an Intune rollout in its infancy, and I&#x27;ve briefly looked at Autopilot, but the low numbers of new PC builds…</span>

 The story starts with me and my company, I&#x27;m a 30-year-old businesswoman who works in an IT service in a bank space. I&#x27;m the girl for everything basically, but I&#x27;m a specialist for first level support, administration and backup, sometimes even networking.
 Even when I&#x27;m not head of my it department, I&#x27;m basically had all the responsibilities of them, but unfortunately my pay grade doesn&#x27;t reflect that at all. I think of my Boss of my IT department as kinda lazy if not incompetent, he even brags about getting so much money for basically doing nothing.
 I have a 40-hour…</span>

                              <span>I have an offer to join one of my previous employers in a new role. The people and the overall working culture is great
 The pay is around 35% more (with the possibility of it being 55% more if I take on-call rotation)
 Issue is - my previous role was not really a match for what they described in the interviews. Now, they&#x27;re talking about major changes, new large customers, restructuring that recently happened and so on and so on. I&#x27;ve confirmed with people still working there that yes, there are new people in management roles and things seem to be going the right way 
 However, I&#x27;m still not sure if I want to come back. Hence this post 
 Any of you made a similar &quot;return&quot;? Any horror or success stories to share? Advice?

                              <span>Doing some local group auditing and cleanup and noticed a great number of domain user accounts are members of their client device&#x27;s USERS group. Since a domain-joined device places &#x27;Domain Users&#x27; in the local USERS group by default, is there any reason for having the device&#x27;s primary user&#x27;s domain account in the local USERS group as well? 
 For example, Sally works for Contoso and is provided a domain-joined Windows 10 laptop named SALLYLAPTOP and account named &#x27;sally@contoso.com&#x27;. SALLYLAPTOP&#x27;s local USERS group has the domain group &quot;Domain Users&quot; in it. Does Sally&#x27;s individual domain account also need to be in the local USERS group of SALLYLAPTOP? 
 If the answer is NO, and adding the specific user account is just redundant, why do you think so many machines have the user&#x27;s domain account in their local USERS group? Is Windows doing this by default? If a domain user signs into a domain-joined laptop for the first time, does Windows automatically add the user&#x27;s domain account to USERS? And is it worth my effort cleaning up all those local USERS groups, removing those individual accounts?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been having some issues with our sip service over the past few weeks. Occasionally we are not able to dial out. We never have issues with inbound calls. After some additional troubleshooting I found that we were not able to dial out after our sip trunks were idle for some period of time, an inbound call would &quot;fix&quot; the problem and allow us to dial out. 
 I ran a packet capture on a L2 switch in between the SIP trunk provider&#x27;s SBC &amp; the ISP&#x27;s router - we see the SIP Invite packets leaving their device but never get a response.
 The SIP Trunk provider states that the issue is they are not receiving those packets. It&#x27;s about a dozen packets sent to 3 or 4 different WAN addresses. They&#x27;re stating the the ISP isn&#x27;t delivering them. 
 I want to call BS on the SIP trunk provider as we&#x27;ve had zero issues with our ISP otherwise. I reached out to the carrier anyways to see if it&#x27;d be possible for them to &quot;prove&quot; they are delivering the packets per the sip trunk provider&#x27;s request. This request seems to be confusing them. 
 Normally I have the ability to just do things myself and figure out who&#x27;s to blame but this is a new one for me. I tried switching our SIP Trunks over to our backup internet (different ISP) and wasn&#x27;t able to reproduce the issue but it wasn&#x27;t a long enough test window that I can say with confidence the issue doesn&#x27;t occur. 
 Any recommendations on how to proceed?

 With so many damn ways to communicate anymore, how are sysadmins handle all the platforms people are using? At this point I have internal and external colleagues on Teams, Zoom, Slack, Meet, Reddit, and Discord. I tend not to be very active on them half because of them being scattered. 
 Back in the days of IRC there used to be clients to merge all the platforms into one app. Does anything like that exist anymore? RSS feeds? A digest app? A dozen monitors? How do you guys manage it?
 Edit: I&#x27;m going to add a little extra context. Our org has &quot;standardized&quot; on four platforms: Teams, Zoom, WebEx, and Slack. Which platform meetings are held depends on the department we&#x27;re dealing with and how inflexible they are. I try to force all communication through Teams, but it&#x27;s hit or miss.
 Vendors and other external orgs (e.g ACM slacks) I deal with tend to use Meet, Zoom and Teams. Again, I try to funnel through Teams but our org doesn&#x27;t do guest accounts and some vendors are stubborn.
 Reddit and Discord is mostly me trying to stay up to date with tech news.

The cheap-o Dell mice we issue are not good enough, so his department will pay for the upgrade. Fine. He says he needs a mouse with a heavy wheel that spins freely? He is rolling his finger over the wheel going &quot;wizz, wizz, wizz...&quot; He says once you roll the mouse wheel it keeps rolling.
 Does anyone know what he is talking about? I don&#x27;t know even what to ask my vendor for.
 Any direction would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;m a new IT Generalist and Internal Facilities Manager.(Our building has their own) I&#x27;ve chosen Snipe-IT for our asset tracking. I&#x27;m kind of inheriting a mess and down for making it work. Smaller business, 100 employees. 30k Sq Ft office. Nothing tracked but machines, not even 100%.
 We outsource our helpdesk for now. So I&#x27;m looking at asset labels, but until I get that approved I&#x27;m just using a label maker. 
 We have several nicer label makers I want to see if I can make work. I still think the laptops needs legit metal tags for durability but in office monitors etc are fine for labels.
 Label makers we have: Zebra ZP 505 Zebra QLn420 Dymo 450 turbo Dymo Letra Tag Brother PT-D400
 Are any of these viable asset tag creaters that would make me not need to order metal/vnyl tags from asset tag.
 As far as asset tracking, I figured these categories were appropriate, pretty much anything over $50 in value. 
 Laptops Desktops Monitors Docking Stations Keyboard Mouse Combo (standard new hire) Keyboards (some are $250) Mouse (some are $100 ) Monitor Mounts? Every person has 2 arms and 2 monitors UPS Units ( So I can track and perform maintenance ) TVs in meeting rooms
 Consumables I understand are toner, office supplies etc.
 So, any of our current label makers be able to be sufficient in a decent quality tag? 
 I&#x27;d love to have it say 
 Property Owned by: Name/logo Company 
  123456
 But I need it pretty small. 
 And do those categories look pretty standard. Should I break it down by Individual office desk or just the general office. ( we have 2 suites ) 
 Thanks yall, I didn&#x27;t see a better sub for this. 
 Also not many great videos on snipe it. I may have to make some.

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I have a client that was recently infected with ransomware and all their files were encrypted. The worst of it was their MSSQL database with all the data they need to run their business without having to restart from the ground up. Due to not following best practices (Not my fault, I work for the software development company that developed the software that uses the database, not their IT provider) they were hit with the ransomeware. They paid the ransome, got the key and had some other company decrypt the data. 
 We got the unencrypted database MDF and backup files. I&#x27;m pretty sure the data is still there but the headers are gone so we are unable to attach or restore the files. I&#x27;m not the most savy with SQL so I thought I&#x27;d probe the mindhive. 
 Has anyone else had any success recovering SQL databses corrupted by ransomeware? TIA

                              <span>I’m an IT Manager for a technology company that deals with all internal IT matters as opposed to anything external such as information security, networking, troubleshooting, security architecture, IT support, policies, onboarding and off-boarding, and security awareness. I do not have anyone working under me as of yet, but I’ve been in this position for almost a year and I think I’ve done pretty good for myself and this company. I wanted to ask you guys is there anything I should probably have in place that I may not have implemented just yet? Or, if you were an IT Manager and deal with all internal affairs, what are some things you’d most definitely put in place?

 I can create an Outlook Rule that uses the &quot;Redirect&quot; message and that will bypass the transport rule block.
 I implemented the Remote Domain method . It did not block emails if the user set up Redirect to in Outlook.
 I am uusing combination of transport rule + RBAC.
 Thanks,

                              <span>Hi ! We have a MBAM server, and I see in our logs monitoring solution that all our PCs are connecting to the server with the system account (PC-NAME$) with the following Events :
 ​
 - Event ID 4624 (successful login)
 - Event ID 4627 (group membership info)
 - Event ID 4634 (log off).
 ​
 So far so good I didn&#x27;t really care about this, since I noticed some that some PCs are connecting way more then others.
 ​
 Like my PC generates 6 events/h and another generated something like 540 events/h. WHY ?
 The PCs are the same, they both are already done with their encryptions, and they show no errors in the MBAM reports.
 ​
 Any ideas...?

                              <span>Hello brothers and sisters, Would love some creative thought on this matter. We are growing from a small business to a very large business very fast. This is a good thing but an issue we have just run into is after letting an executive go it was difficult to audit and see if any files were moved, saved, screen shots taken, ect. 
 I am the only IT member in the company for about 40 people in the HQ office. Is there some type of monitoring software or hardware that would give me the ability to see what is being downloaded, anytime an external hard drive is plugged into the machines, and things of that nature. We use laptops not desk tops and dont know if its even possible to do this type of monitoring with laptops. Does Azure have this form of monitoring?
 ​
 thanks for the help as always

                              <span>Please tell me if im in the wrong subreddit, I couldn&#x27;t find one for this topic.
 Hey I am currently developing a Shopify store and have found the offers in the app store lacking. 
 Im looking for a warehouse management system that can properly track all of my inventory, meaning that it can tell me where Product A is, e.g Product A is on shelf A.
 Concurrently it should also include an order processing system, which will compile a packing list of all the orders that have been paid for.
 Our old system has these features and it would be nice if there was an App that could do the same.
 I have found a couple companies that provide this externally from shopify, although i am not sure how trustworth they are (sksuvault, skusaavy) They seem to have everything I need, but they are very low key and I cannot find enough data supporting them to be reliable. I am willing to consider external apps that can be integrated into shopify aswell as shopify apps themselves.

 Elon Musk’s orders were clear: Close the data center.
 Early on Christmas Eve, members of the billionaire’s staff flew to Sacramento — the site of one of Twitter’s three main computing storage facilities — to disconnect servers that had kept the social network running smoothly. Some employees were worried that losing those servers could cause problems, but saving money was the priority, according to two people who were familiar with the move but not authorized to talk about it.
 The data center shutdown was one of many drastic steps Mr. Musk has undertaken to stabilize Twitter’s finances. Over the past few weeks, Twitter had stopped paying millions of dollars in rent and services, and Mr. Musk had told his subordinates to renegotiate those agreements or simply end them. Th…</span>

From what i am reading, this is a score provided by Microsoft based on vendor responses, and not based on any scientific tests/analysis of the SaaS products.

                              <span>Got a ticket about a user not able to connect to VPN. User is a sales director, heard stories about him at parties about drugs and being wild. I dunno myself but that adds a little context to what happens next. 
 One he’s at a country I’ve blocked being able to connect to my VPN so made exception for him. Ticket had CEO CC’d who he is BFF with and had high urgency. 
 Replied to try again and he replied doesn’t work. I ask if I can remote into his machine and he says okay. I use ConnectWise and I’m in. Before I can even start investigating I get disconnected. 
 Try to reconnect and no go. Call him and no answer. I use CW on my office workstation and works fine. Email him to call me back. 
 4 hours later get email VPN still down. He finally calls me from a weird number and goes yeah I still can’t connect. I told him I was disconnected and he’s like yeah I closed the laptop lid to conserve battery. I’m like I called you why didn’t you answer. Oh yeah I jumped in the pool with my phone… I need a new phone. Then he goes don’t worry you can fix issue after New Year. I go you got my email on your phone right? And tell him you don’t need VPN to check email and if you get email on your phone why did you need your laptop. He just says Merry Christmas even tho we’re past it and hangs up. LOL
 Normally I’d be annoyed but it’s slow and my projects are done for year and I’m just studying for my next cert so this was a entertaining distraction of sorts.

                              <span>The company I recently was hired as a systems admin in has an on-prem mail server that has unauthenticated SMTP enabled, but only for allowed-listed internal IP addresses. The assistant IT director insists this is a safer method than service accounts, but I&#x27;m not sure if I agree. My concern is if DHCP reassigns a previously allow-listed address, it would potentially be possible for that device to spoof emails, or at least send emails using whatever domain address they want unauthenticated.
 What are your thoughts? Should I address this with our IT director?

                              <span>I’ve got a bit of a strange problem with a Dell R520 that presented a no boot device error when rebooting for Windows updates. 
 IDrac shows no hw issues, perc h710 mini shows good health and ran a consistency check with no issues. Virtual disk is selected as boot volume. Single VD, 3-disk raid5. 
 In the bios settings the boot is correctly set to uefi but no bootable devices are detected. 
 If I boot off an iso into Windows recovery I can clearly see the Windows partitions including the efi part and all the files. I also attempted to rebuild the eco boot record from a Dell support article. 
 I’m suspecting a quirky hw failure of the raid card but wanted to check with the community to see if I’m missing anything. Its one of our physical DCs and is redundant so it’s not hurting us, but if I can I would like to repair so I don’t have to do a rebuild.

                              <span>Hello, 
 With the move to laptops from desktops. How are your workplaces handling the management of devices? Compared to an always on desktop getting security patches and software updates overnight versus laptops users and managers seem to tuck away and bring back online weeks or months later at time? 
 Just looking for ideas or comms that other IT teams utilize for situations this occurs in.
 Thanks!

 To check what has been shared by a member of staff. Does a PowerShell script exist that would make this process easier? Management are cracking down on closing down historical shares put in place before the company had any real IT setup.

                              <span>The IT manager title might be a bit generous, but I&#x27;ve been overseeing a three man IT team for a mid-sized nonprofit for the past 5 years, and have worked for the company for over 11 in total. My old boss and I built the department from the ground up when I first started there, and I stepped into his role when he left. Like with most small teams, my position wears a lot of hats from management/planning to hands-on sysadmin and tech work.
 Unlike when my old boss left, I don&#x27;t think anyone internal is capable of filling the role, so while I&#x27;m sure the ship will be kept afloat for a while, they&#x27;re eventually going to have to hire externally. I don&#x27;t consider myself to be particularly hot shit, but unless they get lucky, they&#x27;re going to have a hard time finding someone qualified to fill the role for what they&#x27;re paying. I mostly stuck around as long as I did because of personal investment and the fact I was given freedom to operate and learn, which I value highly. I know their ability to replace me is ultimately not my problem, but I want to do what I feasibly can to make things easier on the guys under me when I leave, especially one who has a lot going on personally at the moment and is unlikely to be able to start job hunting any time soon if things go south.
 I&#x27;m giving a three-week notice after new year&#x27;s. My current plan is to tidy up a couple of existing projects, make sure documentation is all shored up, help with hiring if HR miraculously gets candidates in time, and just generally be a resource until I leave. I might give my boss my contact information to potentially provide services at a contracted rate for emergencies as well, but I&#x27;m undecided on that.
 Is there anything else you guys would do specifically in my situation to help ease the turnover for your team?

                              <span>If you need context, I can see someone talking about it here. I&#x27;m using PHP and unsure of how to wrangle the UI for Azure or other systems in order to unblock the PHP code. What do we need to do? If it helps, the code for our connection is below, but I suspect that y&#x27;all don&#x27;t care about the code (this is PHP + Laravel, which I think is where ClientManager comes from):
 make([ &#x27;host&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;outlook.office365.com&#x27;, &#x27;port&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; 993, &#x27;encryption&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;ssl&#x27;, // &#x27;tls&#x27;, &#x27;validate_cert&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; true, &#x27;username&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;redacted&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;redacted&#x27;, &#x27;protocol&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;imap&#x27;, &#x27;authentication&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;oauth&quot;, ]); $client-&gt;connect(); echo &quot;connected!\n&quot;; } catch (Exception $e) { echo &quot;failed!\n&quot;; } ?&gt; 
 Right now it always outputs &quot;failed!&quot; Thanks for any pointers!

                              <span>After all that flooding in the MDF a few days ago, I&#x27;ve begun planning the hardware replacements. 
 Currently we&#x27;re all in on Aruba/HP switches, with the occasional Netgear. They work great and I like them (besides the netgears). 
 We had new single mode fiber installed in 2015 and its never been used. We&#x27;re still on the gigabit multimode stuff. 
 I figured its time to go 10g, we have 240+ 4k IP cams everywhere and they network is pretty much idling at 90% of 1gbps. I&#x27;ve had to start lowering bitrates on cams.
 The firewall is currently an aging SonicWall NSA2600, which I hate. Considering going Fortigate.
 The question is, Should I go Fortiswitch, or stay Aruba? We have about 40 switches. I hear full stack Fortinet is a magical thing.
 Currently the Arubas are managed by CLI/NetDisco. Its great, but NetDisco cant do much beyond identifying devices, and setting the untagged vlan - and I need to break out putty for anything else.
 Also need a Wi-Fi solution, FortiAP? Currently have Ruckus managed by the ISP, but we hate the ISP to the point where we&#x27;re suing them and will be kicking them out next year. They&#x27;ll probably take their R710s with them. We&#x27;d need about 500 WAPs with PPSK that can guarantee about 300mbps across 900 relatively modern devices.

 I’ve been a pilot for Southwest Airlines for over 35 years. I’ve given my heart and soul to Southwest Airlines during those years. And quite honestly Southwest Airlines has given its heart and soul to me and my family. 
 Many of you have asked what caused this epic meltdown. Unfortunately, the frontline employees have been watching this meltdown coming like a slow motion train wreck for sometime. And we’ve been begging our leadership to make much needed changes in order to avoid it. What happened yesterday started two decades ago. 
 Herb Kelleher was the brilliant CEO of SWA until 2004. He was a very operationally oriented leader. Herb spent lots of time on the front line. He always had his pulse on the day to day operation and the people who ran it. …</span>

                              <span>Is there any living person on this Earth that actually disabled NTLM in his environment?
 Not in a lab or something like that, but with real working functioning production services.
 Because, you know, there is a lot of cybersecurity fuss about switching from NTLM to Kerberos and real vulnerabilities.
 I know that for Kerberos you need to be in contact with DC to acquire tickets or use something like KDC proxy and it is not always feasible.
 I know how to audit for NTLM usage on servers or on DC.
 But the question stands: Has anyone actually did disable NTLM in his production environment? How did it go? What’s the caveats?
 I’m thinking that it is possible to disable incoming NTLM authentication traffic only on some of the servers and audit helps here.
 But the main target here is DCs. So, how about disabling incoming NTLM auth only on DCs? And I haven’t seen any success stories on this matter anywhere.
 I’m asking this question in r/sysadmin specifically, because I don’t need any more guides on how to do it, but actually I need some information from people that actually did it and do support these environments afterwards.
 UPD: I&#x27;m not talking about disabling NTLMv1 and just forcing NTLMv2. I&#x27;m talking about complete disablement of incoming NTLM auth. This GPO for example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic

                              <span>Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like every job I&#x27;ve had I constantly have people adamantly tell me things as golden truths that turn out to be flat wrong. Then I have to work backwards to find why they think something, how it actually works, and get the information correctly, then inform them that they are actually wrong. It&#x27;s usually just &quot;oh okay, thought you meant something else&quot;. 
 I just don&#x27;t understand it. I&#x27;ll gladly be the idiot constantly saying I don&#x27;t exactly know, but I have an idea let me get back to you in a bit. Some people just hammer down concrete facts (to them) even though they are blatantly wrong, and it leads to so much extra wasted time to unravel what&#x27;s actually going on. There have been times when I straight up trusted coworkers and did something exactly as they or their documentation said and its still wrong lol

                              <span>We had a new user that got locked out of her account three days in a row. We&#x27;d remotely unlock and provide a temporary password, with a forced reset at first login, and she&#x27;d be good to go, but the next day it would be the same silliness again.
 After a few days of this silliness, I walked to her desk and watched her log in. No issues.
 The next day, she couldn&#x27;t log in again. I walk over, and she tries again, and no issues. She has no idea what&#x27;s happening and suspects we&#x27;re messing with her. I assure her that we&#x27;re not.
 The next day, inevitably, she can&#x27;t log in again. So I walk over and watch her log in. When she&#x27;s in, I make her log out and back again. And again. After the third attempt, she&#x27;s convinced everything is good, so I walk back to my desk, and she&#x27;s right back there saying it stopped working again. 
 I was irritated by this time, and I asked her to describe exactly what she did after I left.
 &quot;Nothing, I swear! My login only works while you&#x27;re here!&quot;
 Back at her desk, I watched her type in her password more closely and facepalmed. 
 When we gave her a random password or while I was at her desk, she would look down at her keyboard as she typed, and it worked. But all the other times, she would touch-type her password and instinctively add a space at the end.

                              <span>Our company has both internal and external IT support to tackle all of the tasks required from a medium / large organization. A year ago we hired an MSP to help be our &quot;virtual CTO&quot; and were woo&#x27;d with promises of stability, future infrastructure projections and 24/7 on-call support.
 All was well for the first six months, but now we are over a year into the relationship and the veil has been lifted. We no longer get the quarterly check-in&#x27;s with fancy charts and future mapping, the MSP IT team really only have one or two specialists that can work on network issues and complex SQL problems, and worse yet, their &quot;projects&quot; team is a place where tickets and requests go to die unless we babysit the progress.
 We are looking to move to a new MSP that we believe will be able to meet the demands of our company, but until then we are still semi-reliant on our current MSP to handle routine tasks, be on call, etc.I am working to get their knowledgebase of our company extracted for internal documentation in hopes that we can make a smoother transition to a new MSP at a later date. 
 I just want to know what your experience has been with difficult MSP partners, and how to handle them?

 He needs a script that downloads a specific language and sets it as default, configure locale and regional settings. We checked for those things online, and found some long scripts in powershell to configure regional settings and locale (locale is easy), which don&#x27;t appeal him. I&#x27;m just wondering, is there an option to switch regional settings with a single cmdlet or maybe do it programmaticaly in C#? And to download a language package, install it and set it as default?

                              <span>Hey guys - i am a little bit lost currently with Microsoft 365 licensing.
 Let&#x27;s compare E3 vs E5.
 I have just few users on E5 and some on E3.
 How does the Defender for office 365 work currently? Does it need only one user licensed or each one needs to be licensed additionally?
 The users with E3 only will not benefit with Defender for Office 365 at all in this case? So no additional scanning of attachments, safe links options and so on?
 ​
 Thanks

 We are considering this as the feature set seems better and the mail flow doesn’t leave our tenant. 
 Would be interested in hearing anyone else’s experiences.

                              <span>Hi everyone! Ever since we enabled Hybrid AD join in our organisation (or at least I think that is the issue, since I noticed they were gone around that time), most of the users’ machines disappeared from the devices tab under each user. Like we can see their phones for example, but the computer just isn’t there. It’s not a big deal but sometimes it’s the quickest way to find out someone’s machine and I’d like to bring it back for the sake of my own convenience. 
 What I noticed so far is that my own machine, that is not available to look up in my user devices page, its Join Type is Hybrid Azure AD Joined; MDM: None Then I looked up my boss machine, that one is actually available under his Devices tab and what differs is his machine’s Join Type is Azure AD registered, MDM also says none. 
 Could you guys help me fix this and bring all the users devices available under their respective Devices tab. Let me know if any logs/screenshots/etc is needed 
 Cheers and happy happy holidays!

 I have shortcut via GPP. GPO shortcut works, icon does not. I&#x27;m only missing the icon file showing up on the desktops. How do I even begin to troubleshoot this?

 I am trying to delete the files in this directory /mnt/ssdroot/var/lib/pacemaker/cib/ using a service account. 
 May I know what is the command I can use to delete all the files there? 
 Please help! 
 I used &quot;/mnt/ssdroot/var/lib/pacemaker/cib/ delete&quot; doesn&#x27;t work. :(

                              <span>So let&#x27;s take a user who needs some software installed. It&#x27;s unique to the user&#x27;s role. 3 out of 30k employees get this installed. It&#x27;s this and about 10 other installs let&#x27;s say(so enough that it&#x27;s a yeah, yeah, sure, sure, login).
 User contacts helpdesk. Helpdesk tech joins a teams meeting. Install. Admin Credential Prompt. Login by tech. Proceed. Next install. Repeat.
 Except at some point, user opens a command prompt for one of the installs and doesn&#x27;t close it, just minimizes. Session ends.
 User now has an admin command prompt. lusrmgr.msc and they can grant local admin rights to themselves. Undoes everything regarding restrictions on local installs.
 Is this just failure by the user for obviously trying to slip by processes? Or failure of the tech to make sure they watched what they signed in for? Or failure of some larger approach that makes something like this impossible?
 What would you put in place to make it so that a user with an admin command prompt couldn&#x27;t grant local admin rights? Or is this basically past the point of no return and the only thing you can do is make sure the tech watches what they login for?
 Granted. User&#x27;s actions are trying to bypass the rules. I&#x27;m more curious what can stop this beyond better trained helpdesk tech&#x27;s.

 Some time ago, we hired a new SysAdmin to alleviate the metric f*** ton of work I was doing. Today, I still mostly do the same amount of work. It&#x27;s been nearly 6 months, and not much has changed. In fact, this jack has often led to more work for me - perhaps because I care too much - and is sheltered by management time and time again.
 Everyone f\*** up, right?*
 So, fast forward to month 3 of them being here. The time comes for an update to our Microsoft licensing. We decide on a migration to a higher tier of licensing - fantastic, I get new tools to employ (MDE, Azure P2, etc). During this process, I was largely absent as I was on PTO after an extended period of not taking PTO (for almost over a year). Come back to find that they failed to consider the other l…</span>

 Someone pulled the drives out of it. I suspect for “security” reasons.
 Has anyone gone from a used unit to back up and running? I am pretty sure I wouldn’t be able to get a support contract, so I would need new drives and to get their OS installed again.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hello there, we&#x27;re using TL-ER6120 from TP-Link for our IPSEC Connections between few locations, and recently it&#x27;s not really stable. Since we&#x27;re been using it for quite a while now, we&#x27;ve decided to change and try other model or brand. Just wondering what are you guys using for IPSEC connection.

                              <span>I’ve been thinking about a long held tenet of IT administration in the context administrative accounts.
 It’s good practice to have administrative accounts separate to day to day accounts, and only to use them for administrative tasks, but as an extension of that I wanted to find out if anyone had gone even further than segregation of activity by account and actually denied local logon in a windows centric network to admin accounts for administrative functions, relying solely on elevation where required.
 This would include servers and clients; currently my team and myself, login using our admin account to perform admin functions, I’m thinking of changing our governance on that to enforce login using standard accounts with elevation using admin credentials within the standard login required for changes.
 My thinking is that this will reduce the opportunities for misconfiguration by imposing an administrative control whilst simultaneously reducing admin account chatter in our siem logs for more focused reporting and alerting on admin activities.
 Interested in what the community thinks or does already.
 Cheers
 GD

                              <span>A little about me, 10 years in networking - started with cisco/ASA, moved to a fortinet/meraki/multiple sdwan vendor shop - now back in a meraki/fortinet environment.
 I&#x27;ve dabbled with automation/python here and there, decided I want to really dig deep into automation for 2023 and move into a network automation role. The cisco devnet associate exam caught my eye and I&#x27;m really loving it so far...UNTIL it started to get really heavy into the cisco proprietary stuff (DNA,APIC,ACI,NX-OS,CISCO SD-WAN,ISE,UCM,FIREPOWER) UGHHH. I don&#x27;t have real world experience with any of these products, I&#x27;ve always worked in a mixed vendor environment.
 Would it make sense career wise to just tough it out and learn this stuff with no experience ? or should I just learn all the popular automation frameworks/tools/CICD stuff - work on some projects then apply to jobs ?
 Would this cert give me any leverage vs other folks who apply for the same position ? I don&#x27;t know what to do.

 I took on a position as the sole IT person for a startup and have to play many hats ranging from IdP, MDM, security practices, networking, etc just the one-stop shop for everything. I was originally tasked to ensure that we would find a cloud-based VPN solution which I did some digging and ultimately landed with a company called Perimeter 81. So far they seem to have pretty good uptime with occasional drops here and there. But the two problems I&#x27;m currently facing have nothing to do with this platform.

 I’m looking for a documentation or a help for a 4G/LTE network configuration and share with OneAccess521 2T -4G model. I’m not able to find any forum/blog/tuto for that. 
 Thanks for your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in an environment running SD Access for our user space and then our server environment is running on ACI. I have chased this through Cisco/Message Boards and am stuck. I have IP Directed Broadcast enabled in SD Access, I have tried to use a DHCP Relay to send the magic packet but it doesn&#x27;t work the same as a good ole fashioned helper address. It is still trying to use UDP 67 instead of UDP 7. Has anyone had any experience in implementing Wake on LAN in either environment and have any tips? Our ACI environment is network centric, and we utilize Preferred Group members for most of our EPGs.

                              <span>Hi all
 We&#x27;ve run into a major production issue with our pair of Dell 4032 switches - they are used as iSCSI for 3 esxi hosts and distribution for other devices. Issue is: out of the blue we lost access to several VMs. 
 Rebooting one of the two restored access, however, the issue keeps coming back and the only fix is a reload. We replaced one of the switches but the problem remains - after 1 day (at most) we lose access to critical VMs and until we reboot the device. There&#x27;s nothing relevant in the logs (I&#x27;ll attach the spanning-tree detail and running config). There were no changes made to the environment or configs. besides setting the root bridge ID to a lower value on one of the two (from the default 32768).
 Important to mention: when we lose the VMs - switch management and access is…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been a longtime HP/Aruba ProCurve shop and are very happy with these switches. I need to purchase more for expansion and I&#x27;m seeing the only thing relatively in stock are InstantOn switches...
 What&#x27;s the deal? Are they cloud managed like Meraki? Are there limitations for end devices? I&#x27;m not looking for a full conversion over to them but they are priced cheaper and in stock... Don&#x27;t want a device that doesn&#x27;t mesh well with what I&#x27;ve got.

 Nothing obvious is jumping out at me in the docs or on google. 
 Im surprised the feature isnt in there.. or have i just missed something?

 I&#x27;m trying to use Cisco packet tracer but i can&#x27;t replicate the issue. 
 The network is under heavy load and i get really slow response time on the 95th percentile. 
 I see alot of VTP packets on the faulty network but i don&#x27;t understand why since the network is located in remote office with mostly coprate workers and nothing complex network wise. 
 I tried to set the switch as transparent but i&#x27;m still seeing high volume of VTP packets. 
 the switch is a Catalyst 2960

                              <span>Hello to the great people of this community!
 I&#x27;m trying to setup a fortigate box with 4 VDOMs where each VDOM needs to access the internet with it&#x27;s own IP address.
 I&#x27;ve used a Fortinet guide to setup the VDOMs and have the root do the WAN stuff so each VDOM only knows about it&#x27;s own network and forward the rest to the root.
 Everything works but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use a different IP for each VDOM&#x27;s WAN.
 I have a /29 subnet so I have enough IPs but I can&#x27;t find a way to set a different IP since my WAN port has a way to only set one IP for it.
 Any help is blessed!
 Thanks

                              <span>picture this...
 It&#x27;s Friday December 30th, and you&#x27;re wrapping up for the day in anticipation for the New Year&#x27;s holiday weekend. You&#x27;ve got outstanding infrastructure changes to commit but can&#x27;t decide if they should be postponed until the next business day, so you think &quot;fuck it&quot; and slap Enter. The loading bar crawls to completion and the rest is history.
 A day has passed and all seems fine. You&#x27;re headed to your parent&#x27;s place to kickstart the holidays and as far as you&#x27;re concerned, the back-end changes were steadily applied the day prior.
 Your automated IT monitoring solution alerts you about a vague error, but you&#x27;ve just arrived at Ma&#x27;s house so you figure you&#x27;ll deal with it later. Before you can stuff your mouth full of spanakopita, your phone&#x27;s ringing off the hook: it&#x27;s your , screeching at the top of their lungs about a critical revenue-impacting service being down.
 You know how this goes. 
 You&#x27;ve abandoned your poor partner with woke Uncle Ross spouting mercury in microwave theories at the dinner table, while you troubleshoot issues from your parent&#x27;s dialup internet in your childhood bedroom. The stuffed animals judging you from afar because you couldn&#x27;t save yourself the heartache by implementing a change management freeze &#x27;till 2023.
 For the sake of your vacation, your peers, your family, your partner, and your sanity, don&#x27;t hit Enter.
 Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to all, and thank you for keeping this sub dope. &lt;3

                              <span>I’m in a role where they still use on prem print servers with terrible vendor support and no HA. I think the solution may even be end of life despite vendor continuing to take our money.. I won’t name names.
 Ideally I’d like to retain our existing 50 or so MFDs which have card readers which let our users do follow me print with their building passes (which are now an app on their phones)
 New year new solutions, right?
 What do folks out there use for cloud print, and more importantly recommend?

 I’m currently 13 hours into a day with 0 breaks. Every tier 2/3 help desk role I apply for is crickets. Is there really a hiring freeze? Am I stuck in limbo?

                              <span>We use Azure virtual desktop (remote desktop) for our VDI solution. Moved away from citrix a few years ago and so far, been pretty happy with it. However, I hate they call the app remote desktop. Our users are always getting confused between the Remote Desktop Connection and Remote desktop. I have to spell it out and say the &quot;red&quot; Icon. Every time we hire a new person, they are super confused. Why does Microsoft do stuff like this? You would have thought someone said... we already have an app called that so maybe we should use a different name.

                              <span>Anyone use SentinelOne? When I saw its demo it seemed quite good so we went with it. But its increasingly annoying me with its false positives. I know its not a traditional AV, it doesn&#x27;t scan it watches behaviour as far as I understand it.
 Its just blocked and removed another false positive 7Zip! Surely main and well known apps such as 7Zip should be in its own database as safe. And why does it wait for it to run before deciding its &quot;a threat&quot;. I was using 7Zip to unpack a package so SentinelOne has now quarantined all 3388 files :)
 It was using its &quot;Behavioral AI&quot; engine which is increasingly appearing to be shit.
 I now specifically put in an exclusion for
 C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zFM.exe
 And it accepts it but says &quot;This exclusion is not recommended&quot;. Really? Where how else am I suppose to stop you deleting 7-Zip file manager.

For reference, anyone else here have clients affected?

 2) Have a literal army of people whose job is ostensibly to help you make sense of that documentation but if you ever go to them for help they just blabber incoherent nonsense at you and cite random unrelated articles from the help documents until you give up and attempt to figure it out on your own.
 3) If you fail to properly comprehend and implement the incomprehensibly outdated help documentation your life becomes hell.

                              <span>3D-secure visa payment in now compulsory in Europe. Wasabi does not support 3d-secure payment with visa cards, meaning European companies are left without practical ways to pay. Therefore Wasabi first asks to disable 3D-secure (which is not possible), then shut off these customers.
 That&#x27;s an absurd way to lose customers, pushing them to other service providers. Fine for me, good alternatives exist.
 From the customer support :
 Hi xxx,
 I did just take a look at the conversation that you had with my Colleague XXXXXX, all of this was correct. At this time, the Wasabi Console does not have support for Credit Cards the require use of 3D-secure/OTP type authentication. If you do not have another type of card, your account will eventually be deleted form the system due to payment issues.

                              <span>we have a small IT team but a large pool of responsibilities. I manage the cell phones in regards to setting them up with company software and just making sure they work. 
 Twice now accounting has missed bills and had our service shut off. However since all the users know that I touch all the phones they come to me. So its been fun seeing 85 percent of our phones suspended this morning. 
 Any idea about the best way to handle this? It&#x27;s easy for the users to blame IT cause they don&#x27;t have a full grasp of what we do. But Acct should really be in the hot seat imo.

 Setup:
 The company needed a new phone system – bad. They had run out of lines and had started giving IP phones that had no extensions to people. Me, having just started 6 months ago was the prime target for this new project. Not only was I interested in it, but I volunteered, so the job was mine.
 The project was to encompass a few areas. Not only did the company need a new phone system, but after my newbie eyes had looked at their network, I insisted that they redesign it. They had no core switch, and switches were daisy chained so that a single switch failure could take down half (or more) of the company. After showing a report to my ma…</span>

It’s still the production DHCP/DNS server, but used to be a SQL and File server years ago. Moving the DHCP/DNS to the WatchGuard. It’s been running since Sept 2000. This has to be one of the oldest servers still in production.

 A machine at work was being bitlocked and the user that sits at the desk decided to restart the machine, even after being explicitly told not to do so by one of our technicians. Now the HDD in question has failed. Under Disk Management it shows the HDD is not initialized however, it fails to initialize and shows the error message &quot;Initialize disk failed due to fatal device hardware error&quot;.
 Wondering if this has happened to anyone else and how you were able to resolve the matter and bring the drive back to life (if at all possible)?
 ​
 Edit: Thank you everyone for your insight, I am not the most familiar with Bitlocker and all of you have been very helpful.

 - I can&#x27;t seem to find any software that displays the weigh date on the pc screen. The scale brand has an official software but it&#x27;s used for other models and series, my only option is a simple program that &quot;reads&quot; whatever goes into the RS232 card. Any help?

                              <span>I have already posted this in r/vmware but this comunity is bigger and i might get the solution here faster.
 Hi guys.
 I have Vmware Esxi 7.02 server that has 3 VMs. 2 VMs are running OK but when i try to start VM no. 3 i get an error:
 Failed - Module &#x27;MonitorLoop&#x27; power on failed
 The Logs say:
 Errors
 Module &#x27;MonitorLoop&#x27; power on failed.
 File system specific implementation of SetFileAttributes[file] failed
 Failed to extend swap file /vmfs/volumes/6283446f-d6587927-9606-f403435ba52c/VM/VM-d5c1ff7c.vswp from 0 KB to 4194304 KB : No space left on device
 Current swap file size is 0 KB.
 Failed to extend the virtual machine swap file
 Could not power on virtual machine: No space left on device.
 Failed to power on VM.
 Failed to start the virtual machine.
 ​
 But when i try to allocate more disk space(i have 88GB of free space) to the VM i get an error:
 Failed - Insufficient disk space on datastore &#x27;&#x27;.
 Errors
 The disk extend operation failed: There is not enough space on the file system for the selected operation
 ​
 Anyone have any idea? or is my datastore fucked?

                              <span>Hi Folks, 
 We have an issue with outbound emails which are not being received by our customers from past two days. Well it was working before and showing in Proofpoint outbound logs but now it&#x27;s not. 
 We are sending via zoho mail and using Proofpoint as outbound gateway . Zoho support says the emails are relayed to Proofpoint, so you need to check with them. 
 We have raised the issue with channel managers and are waiting for their support (very slow) to respond. Is there any suggestion or recommendation by community members to troubleshoot the issue?

                              <span>We have multiple DCs in different locations for our company. We have a primary Domain Controller. On every DC, we have a constant barrage of event ID 4412 in Event Viewer, saying there is a conflict between files and the losing one is sent to the ConflictAndDeleted folder. I can’t figure out why this is happening. Files replicate correctly, but any file in the sysvol directory is subject to this error and having the copy deleted. I used procmon to see what files were being accessed. Files are being accessed by DFS service. I think it causes the service to think there was a change, and the 4412 event happens. We had nearly 1,000,000 files taking up 120GB before we realized what was happening. The ConflictAndDeleted folder on every server is slowly filing up, ignoring the limit I put on each CAndD folder in ADSI.
 When the DFS Replication service is turned off, obviously nothing happens. But when it&#x27;s turned on, files will disappear from the folder, only to come right back a second later. The folder will have 8 items in it, then 7, then 8, and all I&#x27;m doing is sitting there watching.
 I&#x27;ve spent days on this, trying every article I can find. We have CyberArk and Commvault on the DCs. It might be the archive bit being changed by Commvault, but it&#x27;s happening dozens of times a second, with the same files, and only in the sysvol folder.
 Thoughts?
 ​
 Thank you all in advance!

                              <span>so it seems like Microsoft is disabling the option to install Win 10\11 22h2 for dynamic disks.
 This was their answer as for why
 &quot; Dynamic disks have been deprecated from Windows and we don&#x27;t recommend using them anymore. Instead, we recommend using basic disks or using the newer Storage Spaces technology when you want to pool disks together into larger volumes. If you want to mirror the volume from which Windows boots, you might want to use a hardware RAID controller, such as the one included on many motherboards. &quot;
 why, just why? despite the fact almost all of OEM images already burned w i t h l i c a n s e on a dynamic disk...
 &quot;oh you want to get the latest build? either you remove all of your data and convert to basic or pay for a 3rd party software like aomei to convert for you.&quot; Sorry for the rant but this is just stupid

                              <span>About 11 years ago was when I had my first desk job, having moved from being a field contractor for Dell to a nice office as a Network/Asset Admin.
 After a short contract, I was offered said position at a software company specializing in data analytics/scraping.
 My entire life, I thought that anyone who could code or script was already at the absolute top of the food chain. Had already been there, done that, been through hell desk, and data centers!
 Boy! That Network Administrator position turned into Senior Hand Holder of the Dev Department.
 I was wrong. Very wrong.
 For years after, I continued to think the same of my fellow various admin’s I worked with. Everyone must just be better than me, I don’t know anything.
 Soon, I will be 30. Young-ish I suppose. But I’ve at least learned that we each have our skills. Whether that’s more, or less… 
 Even if someone appears as a prodigy, you can teach them something, many something’s perhaps.
 What did you believe, and when did that change?

Instead he left the thing in his vehicle in the freezing cold for three weeks while he went on vacation. 
 Gig2 One of office staff in another company decided it was okay for him to share his admin accounts with his son to fix technical issues for him while he disappeared for a week. When I told the so &quot;called IT director&quot; response was I don&#x27;t who runs the IT as long as the issues get resolved
 Gig3 Company text me share everyone&#x27;s office365 with everyone and also turn off MFA .&quot;really .... Annoys me when we can&#x27;t access each other&#x27;s emails while people on vacation&quot;
 Sorry i worked lots of interesting it gigs for interesting companies. 
 Bonus holiday one Recruiter/account manager calls me for an backfill. When i got there big message on the door we closed.for the holidays till Jan 3 2022 no one here to open door. I sent pics, email etc. Recruiter says it&#x27;s okay you must work there.

                              <span>Problem: I have a bunch of users that work on desktops, but depending on the day, they log into different desktops (think lab users, secretaries etc).
 They want their user data synced between the desktops, and importantly also their bookmarks.
 For the user data I would use folder redirection, it seems the most straight forward as these desktops are always online and in the domain, they are never moved off the domain so folder redirection should work very well.
 But unless I am mistaking, this cannot sync bookmarks of chrome, firefox and edge, can it?
 For the bookmarks I have been looking at roaming profiles, but this seems to not be recommended anymore as it often creates problems. I have found scripts that would make roaming profiles work with chrome and firefox bookmarks though, so it seems like a viable option.
 Is user profile disks an option here? I know it&#x27;s designed for RDS, which is not the use case here, but rather profiles on local desktops within the domains. We don&#x27;t have an RDS farm and would prefer not to set one up if it&#x27;s not needed (due to licensing etc).
 Assuming user profile disks is a good option here, would it be best to combine it with folder redirection for all the &#x27;standard&#x27; files (as it would likely reduce the size of the disk) or is it better to go with just 1 solution to keep it simple?
 Perhaps FSLogix is a solution here as well? To be combined with folder redirection or on its own?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;m looking for a remote computer management software. I need something very basic, free and secure, it&#x27;s only to occasionally Hello my mother as I live in another city. I&#x27;ve been looking up but I&#x27;m not sure what to get : - Chrome Remote Desktop seems nice but does it have to be the same Google account on both computers ? Can&#x27;t find the answer. - Anydesk looks really simple to use but I&#x27;m concerned about security - Ultraviewer looks nice but maybe sketchy ? - Quick Assist look actually nice but it seems that it will be dead in 2023, and younorobably have to have a Microsoft account ?
 So well, I don&#x27;t need any exotic features, just need something simple, free, safe, like for installing printers drivers for her every two months. Any suggestions ?
 Thanks in avance !

                              <span>Dear all sysadmins, I am part owner of a small/medium-sized growing company. Our company employs around 70-80 employees who are using mobile devices for their everyday work. 35 of them are using Windows laptops, 4 are using MacBooks and the rest 30-40 Field Service Agents are using Android Smartphones. 
 During Covid, we changed our IT infrastructure to a cloud-based one with ZOHO. We migrated from our custom-made onsite apps made on Visual Basic to ZOHO&#x27;s Creator Platform. So far, it has been 2 years and with many ups and downs, we have finally made it to a somewhat smooth transition. Now back to my main question. As many of our employees are sometimes working from home and sometimes from the office, it becomes tricky to manage our devices. This includes windows updates, monitoring for any malware, system monitoring, etc. Is there any cloud-based tool that can help us monitor our devices.
 About me: I do not have an IT background but have to some extent knowledge of how things work. ;)

It authenticates usernames and passwords but not much else. (not a very complex setup). They tried to do some stuff recently and couldn&#x27;t due to them not having the PDC emulator. Is there anyway to fix this or do they have to rebuild the network?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 In the company I work for, some processes still proceed with paper documents.
 For example, if someone from the company is going out by car,
 We have a draft.
 He writes in this draft which vehicle he will go out, where he will go, for what reason he will go out, and he has his manager sign it. The manager then sends the paper to the relevant manager for approval.
 It&#x27;s a no-nonsense thing.
 What is the most practical way to solve this process in the computer environment? Is there an open source web service you can recommend? I would like to use it on my local server.

                              <span>Murphy&#x27;s law got me... I was doing some maintenance before a holiday, and one of the steps was rebooting my core switch, an Aruba CX 6405.
 I rebooted it remotely of course, and noticed it was taking a VERY LONG time for the network to come back online. So I go to the datacenter and see an angry red fault light blinking, along with slot 3 blinking red. The card that has failed is a 48-port smart rate poe card with 4 50g sfp56 ports, part number R0X41A.
 In the logs, I found this information:  Message Event|3207|LOG_ERR|AMM|1/1|Line module 1/3 has failed: Internal error Severity Critical (Priority: 3) Syslog ID hpe-cardd Source Time 12/28/22 21:44:38 (1672281878338489) Sequence # 630,332,193 
 My Google skills are failing me here... I find that event 3207 mentioned in a few documents, but they don&#x27;t give any troubleshooting steps. I have opened a ticket with ASP, but they can&#x27;t even tell me when an engineer will call at this point.
 Any ideas what I can do to troubleshoot? Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried so far:
  
Reboot again, crossing fingers and toes
 Reseat the card in its slot
 Upgrade to the latest firmware published at ASP
 Allowed the switch to perform an &quot;unsafe update&quot; on non-redundant modules (it asked to do this)

                              <span>If cost were not an issue (within reason), would you still purchase Cisco products given that some people have criticized the hardware and licensing as being too costly in relation to the value received? 
 I ask because we are a Cisco Shop. But most of our team in the last few years has retired. We have a 50/50 split and I&#x27;ve been tasked with looking at alternatives for our refresh. We are looking to replace all of our switches to Cisco 9K with ISE (We have), DNA(We have) and NetBox. We&#x27;re going to be running an &quot;SDN Fabric&quot; for our refresh. 
 I&#x27;m looking at Juniper and Arista right now. I really don&#x27;t care what we run. I really just want the best thing possible WITHOUT being overly complicated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m fairly inexperienced (getting there....) but every now and then something comes across my desk that just stumps me. 
 Scenario: 
 I host a client&#x27;s (C1) server in my datacenter. C1 is working with a vendor (V1) to have (site to site) VPN connectivity for V1&#x27;s services. 
 V1 provides their peer gateway - I already have this peer configured for a tunnel for another client (C2). 
 V1 refuses to modify VPN to include C1 (already containing C2) (security policy), they won&#x27;t provide any other peer, I don&#x27;t have an additional peer to provide. C1 has already paid for V1&#x27;s services, signed contract, etc. 
 I know this is a very dumbed-down scenario, but I have no clue how to even start tackling this. I don&#x27;t have any access to C1&#x27;s network. I do have a VPN set up from my datacenter to C1. 
 Could I get some assistance, something pointing me in at least a &quot;starter&quot; direction?

                              <span>It has been my experience that without an IGMP Snooping Querier on the network, multicast traffic effectively flows like a network broadcast within a VLAN (broadcast domain) and will hit every attached node. 
 When you have an IGMP Snooping Querier (like a gateway that is configured to support it) then the IGMP messages flow correctly and IGMP Snooping on the switch-side, which is typically enabled by default, has something to work with and properly filters outbound ports that aren&#x27;t joined to the IGMP group. 
 This is likely an over-engineering rabbit hole, but for networks that you don&#x27;t expect to actually do multicast routing - do you still enable an IGMP Snooping Querier somewhere on the network? That way things like SSDP stay within their boundaries (239.255.255.250:1900)? Although thinking further, the other chatty protocol - mDNS/bonjour uses 224.0.0.251 which is link-local multicast and from my experience doesn&#x27;t get &quot;snooped&quot;. 
 From some PCAPs I did see that Meraki has the layer 2 switch Querier feature enabled by default.
 Just curious if this is something others think about enabling.

                              <span>I am working for a small company that uses Cisco anyconnect VPN. Currently we are using ISE as our radius server to authenticate the users to login for their anyconnect VPN clients. ISE is looking at a IPA server and making sure the users are in the employee group and then says they are good to go. I would like to make a new &quot;connection profile&quot; I think where if i have users in a non-employee group, they get put into a different profile with a completely different IP pool so I can put an ACL on their subnet and control them. I don&#x27;t know how to do that and I don&#x27;t know if I am using the correct terms to google for instructions. Can anyone tell me if I am using the correct terms and if not, what would be the correct things to google? 
 Edit: We are running FTD on FMC. All up to date. Cisco 1140s and vFMC. ISE 2.7 patch 8.

                              <span>I’m wondering if the following setup is even possible to deploy. If so, what would I need to accomplish it, and if not, what would be the best way to achieve similar results.
 I want to have two lines with two different ISPs, and a VPS with a BGP session. Then, I would make a GRE tunnel to the VPS through each line and bond the two tunnels. Finally, I would go out to the Internet through the VPS’s own connection and using an IP range from an AS of my own, announced with the VPS’s BGP session.
 The objectives to accomplish here are mainly three, from the most important to the least:
  
Using my ASN. ISPs where I live charge extremely high prices for a line that allows you to use BGP, so I can save a big chunk of money here.
 
Redundancy. There’s why I want two lines with two ISPs, instead of two lines with the same ISP or even a single line.
 
Increased throughput. That’s why I want to do bonding instead of load balancing.
 
 The real question is: what do I need in terms of hardware and software?

                              <span>Hi all, I noticed a wire hanging out of our fiber junction box (for internet / WAN) recently. Though I could be wrong - I swear it wasn&#x27;t there before, as I was recently around that area quite a bit to inspect a sidewalk install. It doesn&#x27;t connect to anything inside or outside the box - but it comes out through the pipe that the fiber has been run through and is coiled 6-7 times around the last bit of the insulated portion of the fiber cable. The gauge is way to small to be a pull wire and also appears to be way too small to be any type of ground wire. I&#x27;ve seen this type of wire used for signals before, but I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be used for. Gallery Here (three images)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We’re in the market for a new NGFW for our office. Just over 10 users but we host a variety of applications on our server at the office. 
 We currently have a Sophos XG and it’s ok, but I’m beginning to hate Sophos. I don’t know why we went down that path, it’s GUI is clunky, it doesn’t have mDNS (we do a lot of audio visual so it’s handy to have) and today we had to reboot the damn thing because it simply just decided to stop working. 
 We currently have a proxy on our server to handle all the request to different applications from our single public IP. Would be good to move that to the device but not a biggie.
 Our internet speed is 500/500.
 Security is a big thing, I regularly see palo being recommended here, forti too.
 I personally see watchguard, palo and Cisco in the field.
 A apart of me doesn’t want to spend a bunch of money but I know if it’s spent in the right area, I won’t have to think about it again. 
 Saw a silver peak device not long ago but it looks like they only do SD-WAN and not actual firewalling? We’re an Aruba house in central so would tie in nicely.
 We also use the connect VPN from Sophos, it’s good but average too. So anything with a “good” VPN is preferred.
 Open to all thoughts, ask as many questions to help best understand our requirement.

 We get on a call today, him and his narcissist director asked me to write a script to get all logins logs on all the clients aka monitoring remote employees.
 Hint: There are so many other ways to get logins from the UI in azure, Intune and MDE.
 They made it easier for me to give my two weeks tomorrow. ✌️

 I found it on one of the 3rd or 4th pages of Google so it&#x27;s not exactly a large company, but it looks like a lot of big companies use them.

                              <span>Had already been planning on getting out of LastPass before Thursday&#x27;s news. Had already done trial of Bitwarden and 1Password and had Keeper scheduled . We had renewed in Q3 of last year so we would need to eat the cost of the remaining contract. Anyone happen to know with this latest news if there is any way out of the contract?

                              <span>Our firm has acquired a smaller firm and one of the new employees has a 73 gb mailbox and it&#x27;s managed by their on-prem Exchange 2016. They don&#x27;t have a dedicated IT department and our manager wants us to export the mailbox from their environment and import it into ours, which is Exchange 2013 on-prem.
 Now this would be simple if the size was manageable but it&#x27;s not and we&#x27;re trying to avoid .pst corruption and not interested in using any 3rd party apps. I&#x27;ve searched the web, this sub and a few other forums and the consensus is to break the export down into smaller .pst files by either date or folders. Which seems fairly straight forward but I figure I&#x27;d ask the experts to see if that&#x27;s it or if anyone has input on any other workable options.

 Does anyone know of any documentation anywhere that indicates the IP ranges used by different cruise lines, that we can plug in to CA policies?
 Or what country particular branded cruise lines might be detected as?
 In this specific case I&#x27;ll be trying to allow a user on a Disney Cruise, but the answer could be helpful in the future of course for different users and different cruise lines.

                              <span>Yep, the snow&#x27;s falling and the parking lots are skating rinks...and your production SAN/NAS has decided it&#x27;s time for a new redundant power supply...again...only they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em anymore and the budget for next year is already cut and dry! So, considering the money situation and the increasingly important need for a new unit what&#x27;s your go-to storage brand? Keep in mind this will be in-house, no externally hosted solutions. This is a real world issue, not just a theoretical exercise so advice is really appreciated!
 (We finally found a replacement PSU for this old clunker to keep us alive while we wait out the end of the year financial games so we&#x27;re not dead yet...)

                              <span>I have been tasked with setting up one hundred or so desktops in the next few months. When we started it was like one or two a month the process looked like this:
 - Setup desktop
 - Run through the windows setup.
 - Install updates
 - Install Chrome
 - Install Teamviewer
 - Install Antivirus
 - Install Google Drive
 - Setup Desktop Backup
 - Add to asset inventory
 - Install at the end user location
 We are scaling so much that our old process no longer works. Is there a way to replicate these installs so that this could be more efficient, if so what would be a software recommendation to do so?

                              <span>Our fiber provider, comcast, will only open one copper port on their Cienna switch. We would like one additional copper and two sfp&#x27;s opened up and have been trying for months to get them to work with us on this. Is this a standard practice? The provider is Comcast.

 I’m curious what’s everyone’s views on “sent messages maximum size” and “received messages maximum size” 
 what do you take into account to adjusting these two? 
 Is there a rule of thumb for this?

                              <span>As we wrap up 2022, I find myself in the midst of my 1st corporate audit. I started in this new role about 7 months ago, as the first internal IT person. One of the things that is now becoming glaringly apparent, is the lack of documented policies &amp; procedures, along with internal IT auditing. 
 What software are you guys using for ongoing auditing &amp; documenting of SDLC, change management systems and is there a general starting point for a baseline to work with?
 Would like it to integrate with AD, G-Suite &amp; some 3rd party apps if that is possible. Curious to see what is out there.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Something I see with disappointing regularity in the sysadmin subreddit, and to a lesser extent in professional life, is criticism of the &quot;previous sysadmin&quot;. That voiceless, anonymous entity who wasn&#x27;t doing backups properly, left AD in a mess, let some critical server support contracts expire...which our intrepid hero swoops in to fix with a theatrical sigh. &quot;Just another day single-handedly keeping this company afloat...what would they do without me?&quot;
 Besides being a cheap vehicle for self praise and narcissism, they don&#x27;t seem to consider how &quot;their&quot; network might similarly be judged by any new sysadmin taking their position. Suspending their disbelief for a moment that anybody could possibly take over their very important and utterly unique network, they&#x27;d likely find the new sysadmin would have no problem digging out incorrect configurations, design mistakes, oversights, skeletons in the wiring closet etc. 
 Because we all have them. Every network big and small. And what we all also share are budget constraints, time pressures, staff shortages, bad management, lazy colleagues. Take these into account next time you&#x27;re going to shit on the work of the previous sysadmin, especially if you don&#x27;t know them personally, because I can guarantee you the next sysadmin will equally be able to shit on your work too. It&#x27;s very easy to disregard the good work done and focus on the &quot;bad&quot;.
 I just need to remind myself every time I read a comment from somebody &quot;fixing the mess left by the previous sysadmin&quot; that they&#x27;re likely inexperienced, lack exposure to multiple networks, and desperate to display competence to their peers. I was like this too in my first few years in IT, so quick to pick out mistakes to disparage &quot;the last guy&quot;. Now, with some experience behind me, I find myself giving them the benefit of the doubt, realise that whoever set it up this way may have had extraneous factors going against them, and could probably explain if they were there.

                              <span>Greetings Folks,
 We are running a cisco environment, and I&#x27;m currently managing via putty.
 I was hoping to better organize the devices, so that I can label devices by names, instead of referring to a spreadsheet when figuring out what device I need to ssh into.
 I&#x27;ve tried one program, maybe it was superputty, that I used to organize myself. Then, after it&#x27;s software updated, it wiped all my saved device ssh log ins.
 I though it may have been my mistake, took the time to rebuild all, and it wiped again after another update.
 So I&#x27;ve been using putty ever since. 
 Is there an alternative that works simply, that you guys are using? I&#x27;m looking for something minimalistic and easy to use without any complex setup requirements. 
 Looking forward to your thoughts. 
 Thanks!!

                              <span>I got my emails replied to, most returning out of office. Team chats updated. Thought I&#x27;d do my annual resume update this week (keep those resumes updated, even if you are not looking). Try to close a few Notepad++ tabs (New Year resolution not to have 200 unsaved tabs). But I&#x27;m sidetracked playing solitaire.

                              <span>I have been looking for a new job for a while now. Around the beginning of November, I got a hit from a small digital design company looking to bring on their first dedicated IT SysAdmin/Help desk person. Their Lead designer has been their acting IT person and the job has become so much that he&#x27;s not able to do any design work. I have gone through two interview rounds with them as of December 16th and they just scheduled what I presume to be the final interview for January 13th.
 Enter job number two, an international industrial software dev. I applied to this job at the beginning of December, and they got back to me a few days later. I had an initial call with the recruiter. A week later, on December 20th, I had my second interview with one of their two IT personnel. He liked me and I let him know at the end of the interview that I had already done two rounds with the first company and was expecting the third and final round around the beginning of January. He thanked me and said that changes their interview schedule a bit. The next morning, I got an email to schedule the interview with their director of IT on the 22nd. This morning (27th) I got an email that they want to schedule a call for tomorrow to talk about final steps. I presume this means an offer because the recruiter told me both people I interviewed with had positive things to say.
 So, we get to my situation. Do I send an email off to the first company to see about getting the interview moved up to maybe January 3rd if possible? I would like to have two offers to mull over rather than getting an offer and either waiting to accept, or accepting, only to get a better offer and have to rescind my acceptance from the second company?
 Edit: ok, an email has been sent. Now we wait to see what happens.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got a peculiar problem that I have not been able to resolve on my own. Google does not give any good results and none of the suggestions I&#x27;ve tried seems to help. This is a hybrid O365 enviroment, all affected users have been transfered to O365 a long time ago, problem started about 2-3 months ago.
 The problem is that some users (about a dozen or so) randomly loose the ability to send emails ie the email is not sent but stays in the Outbox folder. Only solution so far is to remove the email profile on the affected computer and create a new profile. That helps a week or so before the problem pops up again for the user.
 When the user is unable to send email I can not open the users email settings from Outlook or from the Control Panel/Mail. Nothing hapens when I try to open &quot;Email Accounts...&quot;.
 The obvious Send/Receive manually does nothing. Outlook is online and new email arrive without problem. I&#x27;ve tried to reimage the computer, sfc /sannow (yes, I&#x27;m desperate), reinstall Office O365, start Outlook in safemode, resetnavpane etc etc. My google foo have not given me any good match nor solution to my problem.

 I would like to know if there&#x27;s a way to disable/clear a BIOS password (from dell more specifically) without going into the BIOS manually...
 Reason being that I want to be able to sell the computer without any locks.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried Dell Command Powershell Provider without success..
 And every other guide are for people that forgot or want to bypass a unknown BIOS password...
 ​
 Never thought it would be this difficult.

 My doubt is, since React JS is a dynamic scripting language, can this be hosted in an S3 bucket? Can React JS call a Lambda function endpoint?

                              <span>At my previous job we had a 2010 exchange server for which new users didn&#x27;t have anything to do when setting up their Outlook client for the first time : start, next, next, done.
 Earlier this year I joined a new company where I am now the sole IT and there are things with which I am still unexperienced. 
 In this case, we run an on-prem exchange 2019 and clients can send and receive autodiscover request, however it asks for the server type (like here) and I just couldn&#x27;t find if this is normal or if the autodiscover is faulty. I have seen nowhere any clue if autodiscover should provide what type of server you are connecting or not, but my instinct tells me that the autodiscover answer from the server should provide that.
 Anyone knows where to look at to send that to clients when they do an autodiscover ? 
 I have extensively tried the tools to test Autodiscover, and it says my settings are correct, however it doesn&#x27;t say where this setting is supposed to be, if it actually exists.

                              <span>Hello admins,
 I hope you had a great xmas time.
 I want to start using WAC but due to a multiple domain structure without a forest (I know, I know. Not my fault) I want to save credentials for the imported servers. But everytime I restart WAC it shows my user, not the user information I added to the entries.
 Is there any possibility to save the credentials or is it just not possible by design? It drives me crazy that I cant use WAC because of that.
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Scenario, on-prem servers, 100 users. Plan is to migrate mails from on-prem exchange 2013 (1 server) to Microsoft365 and then get rid off on-prem exchange server, but keep on prem ad server, sql server, legacy apps, SSO (same password for mail, pc). So we want to have some kind of hybrid environment with mails being in a cloud. We dont want to reconfigure all computers (or at least amount of time if it has to be), have at least amount of downtime.
 Reading MS pages and articles online gave me some info that minimal hybrid migration would be an option. But still there will need to be on prem exchange server to manage users? Are there any solutions to this to get rid of old server or have a newer exchange version on a VM just for management? Also i dont quite understand the line from MS article &quot;Do not plan to continue to run directory synchronization to manage your users&quot;? Isnt this hybrid migration?
 Is there a more suitable migration path for this case?
 TLDR version, plan is to get mail in a cloud, get rid off old exchange 2013 server and manage mails on exchange online. Infrastructure remain on prem. What is the most suitable option.

                              <span>Hello, we are mainly a Bentley focused environment company, used to the select series model of paying additional for quarterly license uses. We can set the number of licenses needed and additional users will be locked out, thus preventing compliance issues. Shit bag Autodesk is asking us to purchase 5 3-yr civil 3D licenses to come to compliance, they claim our 2 user subscriptions had additional install/session more than the number of licenses. We asked them to reduce the demand , as those licenses will sit idle and be a waste since we don’t use civil 3D much. They looped in their attorney, and we asked them to communicate with our legal as well. they started to increase their threats, saying there will be a 25% additional penalty if we involve legal. Is this even legal? They are retaliating if wanted our attorney to communicate with them on our behalf? We never threatened litigation or lawsuits, and only asked for our lawyer to handle communication with them as We are too busy to keep discussing it with them. They know we are valid customers, as we spend $40k+ per year on their ridiculously expensive innovyze software, which they recently acquired to add to their monopoly. Any suggestion to responding to Autodesk, when they threatens to add additional penalties to talk to our legal? We paid them the stupid 5 licenses, at this point it sounds like they like to retaliate and have their customers bend over. Funny thing is we have alternatives, unlike architects who are dependent on Revit, etc. In three years we will move towards an Autodesk free environment.

 Even If these updates are canceled wsus bits jobs get stuck, and I have to wsusutil reset every time.

 I&#x27;m struggling to find any concrete (and reliable) examples of a similar implementation to work from. Anyone familiar with the topic probably already knows how lacking the vendor documentation is for this.
 Anyone here have any experience or good references for this?

                              <span>from the dhcp rfc:
  
Note that, in some network architectures (e.g., internets with more than one IP subnet assigned to a physical network segment), it may be the case that the DHCP client should be assigned an address from a different subnet than the address recorded in &#x27;giaddr&#x27;. Thus, DHCP does not require that the client be assigned as address from the subnet in &#x27;giaddr&#x27;. A server is free to choose some other subnet, and it is beyond the scope of the DHCP specification to describe ways in which the assigned IP address might be chosen.
  
Imagine a relay receives a DHCPDISCOVER on interface eth0 with address 192.168.1.1, then it forwards it to the dhcp server at 192.168.0.1, now because it&#x27;s not required to give an address on the 192.168.1.0 subnet, it gives an address on the 192.168.0.0 subnet, how is this acceptable?
 ​
 Then another host on the 0.0 subnet would arp for the client, but the client wouldnt receive the arp broadcast since they are not on the same physical subnet.

Being on the Network Team, I am responsible for replicating these network services hosted in our Primary DC. These services include Remote Access on Palo Alto, F5 Load Balancers, DMVPN HUBs running on C8000v, etc... Below is a brief list of the following network VMs I am deploying in Azure that this post is about. I have listed the following services below:
 - Two C8000v Routers: To run as Primary and Standby DMVPN Hubs, which will mirror the DMVPN Hubs we have in Primary DC.

                              <span>Some time next year, my coworker and I are integrating our DMZ switch into the Core switch. The DMZ switches have reached EOL, and our network is small enough to handle the extra traffic load put onto the Core switch. Now back when I took my CCNA, I got the impression that the DMZ switch was supposed to be a separate switch, but my coworker, who has way more experience than me, says that in his experience they&#x27;re integrated into the core.
 That being said, I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around how the integration would work. I am thinking it&#x27;s a case of directing incoming traffic from the ISP switches via VLANs to our firewall, before the firewall allows the traffic onto the core switch?

                              <span>Greetings Folks,
 We are running a cisco environment, and I&#x27;m currently managing via putty.
 I was hoping to better organize the devices, so that I can label devices by names, instead of referring to a spreadsheet when figuring out what device I need to ssh into.
 I&#x27;ve tried one program, maybe it was superputty, that I used to organize myself. Then, after it&#x27;s software updated, it wiped all my saved device ssh log ins.
 I though it may have been my mistake, took the time to rebuild all, and it wiped again after another update.
 So I&#x27;ve been using putty ever since. 
 Is there an alternative that works simply, that you guys are using? I&#x27;m looking for something minimalistic and easy to use without any complex setup requirements. 
 Looking forward to your thoughts. 
 Thanks!!

                              <span>This is an odd one - i&#x27;m not a networking guy, much more of a generalist. We have the vendor reviewing this but they are taking their time.
 We have a box in the DMZ that has a nic in our LAN and a nic in the DMZ.
 When it&#x27;s up, it causes two external facing resources to go down which also have IPs in the DMZ.
 Running a packet capture from the troublesome box reveals that the impacted resources are retransmitting many packets and I&#x27;m seeing many SACK_PERM&#x27;s, but it also appears to be as though this trouble box is jumping into other conversations. Example:
 381 7.286147 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [external IP of something outside our network] TCP 68 [TCP Port numbers reused] 443 → 53905 [SYN, ACK] Seq&#x3D;0 Ack&#x3D;1 Win&#x3D;8190 Len&#x3D;0 MSS&#x3D;1460 WS&#x3D;256 SACK_PERM 382 7.286170 [troublesome box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 96 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 Where packet 382 contains the source and destination IPs from packet 381. It&#x27;s like the troublesome box sees packet 381, encapsulates it, and sends it back to the impacted resource, but gets a destination unreachable. It&#x27;s not doing this to all other IPs in the DMZ either, just two of them.
 Another example of the trouble box showing up after a regular ICMP
 349 6.621700 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [some external IP] ICMP 62 Echo (ping) reply id&#x3D;0x0004, seq&#x3D;8403/54048, ttl&#x3D;255 350 6.621737 [troublesom box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 80 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 And packet 350 contains this under the ICMP portion of its packet: Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: [impacted resource DMZ IP], Dst: [some external IP]
 Anyone have any idea what this thing is doing?

                              <span>I have a client that says file transfers are slow on two machines. 
 Comparing on a machine that&#x27;s fine it&#x27;s transferring with no issues and the packet lengths are like 20k, 30k etc, pretty large. 
 On the slow machine none of the packets are going over 1514 bytes. 
 Pretty sure it&#x27;s something to do with window size or mss but I&#x27;m not super familiar with troubleshooting these. 
 Handshake looks like:.

 Syn ack  win 262656

 Hello! I know this subreddit doesn’t often concern itself with layer 1 folk, but I am unsure of any other relevant subreddits to ask in, so will post here. 
 Basically, I have been tasked auditing all the fibers at a Headend for a Cable MSO and have been racking my head on the best way to capture data to best satisfy all involved. My employer contracts with the MSO to provide a plethora of services both for the inside plant and outside plant. I’m technically being paid by the Construction department, but since my work is meant to support everyone involved with “Node Splits”, I have been trying to loop in all relevant parties:
 Satisfying the Headend folk is fairly …</span>

 I spend the last 1.5 years working from home, using my personal desktop computer (PC). There were several things I had to install, to let me clock in &amp; to connect to their phone system &amp; network. One of the things was called SentinelOne; we were only told that it was for security/malware protection, since we would have access to a lot of sensitive information; made sense, since several hacks/breaches had been in the news around that time.
 It ended up blocking my PC&#x27;s internet access, except for the program itself, so that it could continue running (can&#x27;t close it, 24/7) &amp; sending regular screenshots &amp; reports (every 4 hours). Took a ridiculous amount of time, but finally managed to make them remove it (couldn&#x27;t uninstall it myself, though I&#x27;m the administrator).

                              <span>One thing that particularly bugged me was finding out that some LastPass fields might not be encrypted. This is kinda worrisome, so I was thinking about creating my own encrypted notepad app. How does one even apply encryption though? And is it possible for any regular person to encrypt something with the same level of strength as that used by big companies?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of threads regarding Password Managers. Since this place has helped me grow in the last 5 years, I&#x27;d like to contribute to the community.
 Today, I&#x27;ve put together a How-To guide on deploying a self-hosted BitWarden instance. The guide will go over the following:
  
How-To Create the Virtual Machine
 How-To Install the Operating System
 How-To Configure the Operating System
 How-To Install BitWarden
 How-To Automate the Maintenance for BitWarden
 (Later) Admin Training Documentation
 (Later) User Training Documentation
  
To see the entire list of high-level steps for this How-To, please view the overview page here: BitWarden Self-Host Installation Overview - GitHub
 The guide is broken into 4 Chapters (5 &amp; 6 will be made when I have time tomorrow):
  
Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine: Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine - Github
 Chapter 2: Operating System Setup: Chapter 2: OS Setup - Github
 Chapter 3: BitWarden Application Setup: Chapter 3: BitWarden Setup - Github
 Chapter 4: BitWarden Automated Maintenance: Chapter 4: Automated Maintenance - Github
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 5: Admin Training Documentation
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 6: User Training Documentation
  
Chapter 1 &amp; 2 will more than likely be skipped by many of you, but it was created to show the entire process from start to finish.
 In Chapter 4, I go through on how to automate the maintenance. The PowerShell scripts do NOT have email notification enabled by default. If you have your own email functions, you can swap in your function with the one in the script and uncomment the Send-Email lines within the script(s).
 Please leave your suggestions on what I should add, remove, or change. The scripts can definitely be updated (e.g., creating a PowerShell module would be a good start).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on this Service Desk for 14 months. It was great experience and I learned a lot from teammates and a kind engineer on the systems team.
 When hired, I was told there were possibilities for growth etc. At the time I had some college experience and a couple months in helpdesk, so it was an amazing position for me. 
 The manager of the systems team publicly stated multiple times that he wanted me on his team and I should get training to move over. That was 5 months ago. I got my AZ-900 and constantly asked for permissions to take over more work. I was only ever given permissions to do a task after a month of begging to do more. 
 I got a job offer for a Jr. sysadmin position with a significant pay raise. They are aware of my limited experience, but liked my attitude. I gave my old position one chance to match and all I got was a job description of an &quot;associate engineer&quot; without my name, the date, anybody&#x27;s signature, pay was verbal, and no effective date. No thanks 
 I&#x27;m looking forward to escaping the out of the SD for obvious reasons, but expect to come across an entirely different set of issues lol. I was the glue that held that team together, and I know for a fact that two people will be leaving right after me.

                              <span>I’m a software engineer by trade, now a manager of software engineers. Three years ago my company (around 100 people) had an IT Director, A VP of Technology and an Assistant IT Director. The VP of Technology moved on. Then the IT Director moved on and the assistant was elevated and finally he left a little over a year ago.
 Recently my company asked me to be Director of IT and I said no. I got a look at what all needed to be done, our security needs, etc. and decided it was too much for one person and not what I wanted to be doing, so I said they should hire someone and turned them down.
 Recently, they started asking me to tackle specific IT tasks as one-offs and I’m finding myself drifting back towards a role I said no to. Being asked to take on more and more responsibilities related to IT. 
 I’m not sure what my question really is. I’m just lamenting the situation, I think. With some institutional support for decision making and maybe some staff to actually execute, maybe I could do the job. I don’t have the experience specifically in IT, though, and I’m muddling through based on having 2 decades of general software experience and enough systems experience to be dangerous.
 There is definitely more to this job, however, these days. More than just knowing how these systems work. There’s prioritizing the various risks the company faces and executing the implementation of systems and processes that we’re now behind on from years of neglect. To say nothing of how to deal with upgrading equipment, budgeting for long term maintenance, etc. It just feels very overwhelming and I’m wondering if it’s crazy that I just want to walk away.

 Of course, the issues with and fragility of Southwest&#x27;s IT infrastructure have been well-known for years now, and it&#x27;s management&#x27;s own fault for not taking the initiative to develop it to meet the demands of their rapid operational expansion and the modern industry (including interlining, GDS interoperability, etc.)...

                              <span>MDF flooded today (12/26). Well more than just the MDF, like most of the building flooded today when the fire suppression system and water main exploded in multiple places. We&#x27;re talking 110PSI of water flying out from an 8 inch water main somewhere in the ceiling and just destroying everything. I had a co-worker show me video of a poor HP prodesk getting blasted with unbelievably high pressure water.
 This actually started on xmas (yesterday), I was watching over the cams remotely and seeing the mess unfold. At the time it didn&#x27;t affect me so I just sat at home and watched the chaos unfold. I thought they turned the water off for the whole building but today around noon - more water lines exploded in a few more places - and one of those was the MDF.
 By the time I got in there, it was no longer raining from the ceiling. 
 It was bad - water was pouring out of the 5x Aruba switches that sent network to the rest of the building, about 7/8 of the network was offline. Luckily the server room and about two IDFs not in the chain were fine. Basically, only the basement of the building near the server room, and one random hallway was unaffected.
 After 3 hrs of using a leaf blower to help the internals of the switches dry, I decided to go for broke and connected them back and they all worked! That part of the network was only down for about 4 hours, so in all honesty I think it worked out pretty well, most people were out of the office so it wasn&#x27;t that much of an interruption.
 It will hold for tonight but I think I&#x27;m going to get my 10g network upgrade very soon. Eventually corrosion will kill those switches.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m trying to set up an Apache as a temporary forward proxy. Actually all it has to do is forward everything to the actual proxy server until some client misconfiguration has been sorted out.
 My config works for http connections but all https connections fail.
 here is the virtual host config:
  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ProxyRequests On ProxyVia On SSLProxyEngine On ProxyRemote &quot;*&quot; &quot;http://xx.xx.xx.xx:9091&quot;  
 The error in the log says
 AH01144: No protocol handler was valid for the URL...
 Anyone here can help me out how to get it to work with https? The SSL doesn&#x27;t need to be terminated on the Apache. Everything should just be shoved to the actual proxy.

                              <span>Apologies, this is a bit of a long post - I&#x27;ve tried my best to not ramble!
 I left the industry just over a year ago, in order to fully commit to my business, and I&#x27;m absolutely certain it saved my life.
 Back in 2011 I started working at a small (10 - 40 people) company that managed insurance claims for private companies and public bodies like water boards, regional councils etc - a few years before I left we even managed to secure work with the government, including some government ministries. My main role throughout that time was IT Manager, but as with all small firms, I had to wear several hats - everything from sysadmin through to contract negotiations, and fixing laptop screens.
 Reflecting on my experiences now I think it&#x27;s a wonder I didn&#x27;t end up in hospital, or take my own life…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a Windows sysadmin for over 20 years and while I do still enjoy my job, Microsoft is making it harder and harder every month.
 They will either break stuff with updates or the fixes are questionable and you feel like you have to put them off for a month or two just so it doesn&#x27;t cause any unneeded stress and extra work. If it&#x27;s not Microsoft killing something then it&#x27;s a user needing something after hours or on a day off. (I&#x27;m the only IT guy for the company which I know will start other conversations but that&#x27;s not the point of this post)
 I&#x27;ve been getting into Linux here lately and was wondering if a Linux sysadmin position would be any different.
 I guess a lot of it will depend on the company and support structure so it could be possible to jump to a different company/position with the exact same issues that aggravate me now.
 Maybe I&#x27;m just getting burned out and looking for something different (less stress and responsibility) but that would require starting over and probably taking a pretty big pay cut.

 About the only issue that we see remaining is how to deal with printer SMTP for scanning copies. 
 Ideally a Windows based solution. We thought of spinning up a new Exchange server, but that seems like massive overkill. We’d like to also keep the traffic on prem.
 Thank you in advance for your responses.

                              <span>Throwaway account. I just need to get this off my chest and hopefully get some insight.
 A few weeks ago, I left my job of 7 years as a solo sysadmin at a small company. I felt underappreciated by mgmt and was getting tired of everything landing on my plate. I wanted to be part of a team and have co-workers to collaborate with.
 I ended up at a large MSP about 2 weeks ago, but I&#x27;m starting to regret my decision. The position is remote, the benefits are good and the pay is decent, with no overtime/on-call necessary, but I&#x27;m starting to question whether I made the right decision.
 For starters, the position requires a lot more time on the help desk than previously indicated. The documentation is lacking and nobody on my team really seems to know what&#x27;s going on. Every client&#x27;s environment is…</span>

                              <span>Year 1- Two guys come up with a good idea for a product. They listen to the sysadmin community about features and eventually come up with a beta to release. Support is excellent. Vulture capital is presented as its generating a lot of good buzz.
 Year 2- RTM happens and it starts to sell well. Company goes public. Two guys no longer care about the product as they are multi-millionaires with hot girlfriends. 
 Year 3- A third party comes in to manage the company. They no longer listen to the community. They look for ways to squeeze more money to investors. Turnover is high. Support is sent offshore to companies who barely speak your language.
 Year 4- Every new release makes the product worse. Every new patch breaks something else. Customers already invested too much time and money to switch products. Customers complain but there&#x27;s now no one to call or answer emails besides the offshore support company, and they are useless.
 Year 5- Sales start to tank. Company comes up with an idea to bundle the now horrible SW with other products that do sell and turns it into a subscription.
 Year 6- Company is delisted and the SW is sold multiple times to equally horrible companies who try to sunset the product and get you to move to their other more profitable products.
 Year 7- SW assets are sold multiple times over the years until no one will buy the product and it fades away.
 Year 8- Two guys come with a good idea for a product...

 I am in the middle of standing up vRealize for some of these tasks, but I wanted to know what every else is using or would suggest? We’re new to the automation game, and I know my way around PowerShell just fine. But I assume that there is a whole world out there to learn, so I wanted to see what else every recommends for managing windows/Linux tasks, server creation, data archiving, etc…. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Anyone making plans on leaping to something other than VMware vSphere in the upcoming year for their on-prem environment?
 If so, what are you looking at?
 We&#x27;ve just renewed support for our vSphere licensing for 3 years to give the business some runway to figure out if we are going to stick around or not. 
 That gives us time to see how much of a damn dumpster fire this Broadcom deal is going to be, but I figured I would see what others are doing.
 Hyper-V is high on my list as we are a Microsoft shop primarily, but XCP-NG looks favorable too. Red Hat Virtualization seems promising as I have played with oVirt but is daunting to deploy. 
 Anyway, thanks in advance for the feedback!

 I had to tell them the classic Linux WiFi example from back in the days of forums where you just didn&#x27;t ask the question or you would end up with dozens of smart-ass comments and no answers or everyone letting you know you are a dumbass ass for not knowing a simple config. You had to pose it as a challenge or insult. They understood.
 The classic Linux WiFi example - When you have a problem you need help with, how you deliver the question makes all the difference in getting a fix. For example if your wifi stopped working on Ubuntu never go on the forum with a question asking for help to get your wifi working. No matter how detailed you are all you will get is snarky comments, RTFM, you are a dumbass, any noob should know that, and no answer. 
 No, if you want a solution quickly simply post &quot;Ubuntu 10.04 Linux is a hacked together piece shit that won&#x27;t even support wifi on my Lenovo T43. I&#x27;m going back to Windows.&quot; Now check your post in about an hour and you&#x27;ll have a hundred comments calling you a dumbass but also another hundred comments with a step-by-step solution just to prove you wrong that wifi does indeed work on Ubuntu. That my friends is how to get answers on the Internet.

                              <span>Hi. I have two simple Windows VPS. One is Windows Server 2019, the other is Windows Server 2022. Before, on my Windows 2012 VPS, I was using Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to scan it for vulnerabilities that hackers could use to hack into my VPS. Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer was quite good and if my memory is correct, it would also check your ports, check if certain protocols were enabled that hackers could abuse (ie. checked if SMBv1 was enabled), etc, which was really useful.
 Unfortunately, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) has been discontinued by Microsoft and I don&#x27;t think the last version is even applicable to Windows Server 2019/2022. Is there another very popular software that administrators use to scan a Windows Server for vulnerabilities and if so, how much does it cost (MBSA was free)?

 My office recently got a lot of Cannon 3226i machines and a cannon 4835 machine. Now I set up the 4835 scan to folder and it took a minute barely.
 But when trying to set up the 3226 scan to folder it will not work. Anything I do wont work. I did the same thing with the 4835 and it keeps giving me the #801 error. Tried updating firmware/installing uniflow online express, making a user dedicated to accessing the shared folder, everything. Always give me a wrong user/pass when trying to connect to the NAS server via machine, and when configuring from the UI always gives me #801 even though the 4835 works perfectly, anyone had the same problem? Going crazy here

                              <span>So we&#x27;re looking for a password manager for our business and with all the LastPass issues I saw Keeper Security mentioned who aren&#x27;t one I had really heard of until now.
 Their website has some pretty good info on it around their security model and how secure they are but of course &quot;they would say that wouldn&#x27;t they&quot; seems to apply.
 I have a few people who&#x27;ve been using LastPass now asking me what I&#x27;d recommend and usually I say to look at Bitwarden or 1Password but this looks quite good.
 Is anyone using them please and if so what&#x27;s your feedback on the product both for enterprise and individual use?

                              <span>Hi all, Title pretty much says it.
 It happens cause the system tries to show folders and files from the domain file server
 I&#x27;ve managed to cancel this in windows file explorer, unchecking remember folders and files in folder options but have no idea how to do it in office.
 Also a lot of time for log in screen trying to contact dc.
 Any ideas? This is really annoying.

I am sysadmin in a relatively small company. I have made many things to modernize and update their systems. We still use Domino server and Lotus Notes. Its just horrible but the owner won&#x27;t hear a thing about it. He simply want to use it and there is nothing anyone can do about it. 
 Recently, however, Domino server crashed and had some real troubles to work correctly. Domino is hosted, of course, by owners friend, somewhere in a garage. (both are old blokes who worked in IT in 90&#x27;s okay, so they &quot;KNOW EVERYTHING&quot;) I told them many times that its a bad idea to rely on whole email system to be hosted somewhere on a home internet, and that guy is amateur who dont update his…</span>

 Anyone know if theres a downloadable version of the command line tools? I had some nice scripts set up to pull in the lists of pending patches for machines. This has now broken and I can&#x27;t see any other way of achieving the same result.

                              <span>I received an offer for a network support position ( network administrator ) in a managed private cloud service provider ( VMWare, Azure as vendor ). Currently working at a TAC for a known network vendor supporting their firewall.
 I&#x27;m worried that this role being mostly support ( few change requests, policies, VPN tunnels, VLANs etc. ) could be less benefiting from a career perspective than a more generic network engineer role in an enterprise enviorement ( as it would include maintenance, support, planning , deployment etc.
  
Please share your opinion in the above worries.
 Can you switch into an enterprise role easily after a support role from an MSP?
 How do companies offering contract role view MSP experience?
  
They highlighted that the role is challenging at least 20 times during two interviews and that after 6-12 months project work ( FW deployments, migratons etc. ) can be requested as well.
 Tech stack: - Firewalls: Fortinet, Clavister - Cisco ASR Routers - Switches: Arista, Cumulus - VMWare NSX - NO Automation, NO SD-WAN 
 Tickets are highly variated, examples but not limited to: - Change requests - L2/L3 redundancy - IPSec, SSL VPN, interconnects - Generic R/S TS

                              <span>Last week, I found a domain search whois type of site that displayed traffic estimates and ranks. For a couple very small sites I know, it estimated &lt;200 visitors in a month, and the rank was like somewhere in the millions. For a much larger site, like cbs.com, it reported/estimated it at top 100 or so, and I think I entered &#x27;facebook.com&#x27; and it said #2 at 600MM visitors. I understand these estimates are directional at best, but I thought it was a neat addition to a typical whois search, which doesn&#x27;t really reveal much these days with GDPR in effect.
 I was using Private Mode on Firefox, so it didn&#x27;t log in my history, and I can&#x27;t remember the site now and it&#x27;s driving me nuts. Anyone have a lead? Thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys! First time posting on this subreddit, so please forgive me for any mistakes. 
 I am starting a company where I will give my partners/users, an android device, which has a few apps they still use to access my service. The concept is kind of like doordash, but perhaps a bit more individual. 
 For this system I have been looking into a few things, among other things the Soto MobiControl system. To give a better insight of what’s needed and why I will provide a short description below.
  
A way to remotely access the devices so that my team can do the debugging in case something goes wrong, instead of having to try and explain to the users what to do. 
 With this I am also looking to heavily restrict what apps can be accessed, and also settings so the device can only be used for its actual purpose, and the chance for problems by pressing something wrong occurring decreases.
 An easy way to automatically set up the devices with the right apps and restrictions, perhaps using a connection to a pc or something along those lines.
  
I have looked a bit into the Soti platform, but as far as I have understood I need a dedicated server with databases and stuff to use their solution, which is per today not an option. 
 The perfect scenario would be a cloud based system for accessing the above mentioned functions, preferably a cheap one too since we are a completely new company with not much money to spend. I am looking forward to you guys’ ideas!

 Am I missing something about real jobs or the LinkedIn recruiters are completely lost? At my point of view, DevOps and Cloud Engineers have different responsibilities.

                              <span>Left a company almost a year ago. Got a call today because the owner couldn’t access his computer remotely from home.
 Was told by the replacement IT person that they got hit with ransomware, incl backups. 
 So I said - the documentation is written in a binder in the office with everything you need and why are the backups encrypted?
 Find out that the IT person copied the documentation to the server and threw out the book. They also got rid of immutable backups because it costed to much money. 
 They offered me my old pay (per hour) to help. 
 I wished them a happy holidays and good luck
 Felt so good. 
 Happy Holidays ya’ll!!!

                              <span>It&#x27;s my understanding that the secret key adds an additional layer of security (not sure if Bitwarden has something similar).
 I have used, and will continue to use, the example of cracking the verifier, as that has a nice analogy to cracking password hashes on a traditional service like Barkbook. But what is at stake here is whether Mr. Talk, given access to what is stored on our servers, would have the capacity to decrypt Molly’s data. Molly’s 1Password Secret Key means that the answer is no. Mr. Talk would not be able to crack that even if he put every computer on Earth to work on the cracking and ran them for zillions of times the age of the universe. I am happy to use words like “never” and “impossible” for that.

Some scientists, some managers, some students, little money but great possibilities for personal activities. I am just to ask: what one should do first when he/she gets a SA job? What plan one should have, how to act and what is the most important thing to pay attention to? What was your experience, your best practice? I have no time for great but annoying literature, do are there any cheatsheets? I am asking because now I have more than 100 workstations, no central management like AD or stuff, some Win10, a lot of Linux RHEL, no security, no docs and so on. And I just want to make things right,)

This a few hours after the Christmas explosion outside AT&amp;T&#x27;s POP in downtown Nashville, making us think our DC was also under terrorist attack. Good times... time to repaid fibre strands: two days.

                              <span>Team is looking at using RedSeal&#x27;s on prem tool to map our network out. Supposedly you can ingest firewall rules from your devices into the program and it plots out your network for you, showing you what could potentially be exposed to the internet and on what ports so you can review and shutdown any open holes you&#x27;re not fully aware about or got lost in bad documentation/poor communication issues.
 It&#x27;s pretty pricy though, the 1st demo I had looked decent but the inventory side of it i&#x27;ve already accomplished via Netbox. I could do the network topology too via Netbox but that&#x27;s manually entering things in instead of allowing a tool to go out, grab the firewall rules and ingest it properly. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a ansible script method I could use to poll all that info and feed it up into Netbox&#x27;s api but that&#x27;s more work then I have the time for currently.
 Was curious if there were any other open source alternatives to this tool or people&#x27;s thoughts and opinions on it?
 Mostly a RHEL/Ubuntu shop with some Windows hosts peppered throughout.

 I just want to know, so I know when the time that will eventually come, comes:
 Is it actually hard to replace, or is it simple and I can do it, but they say its not to cover their butts?

 At the moment I work in an office as internal IT in a team with 3 other junior admins. We are the escalation point of the helpdesk which does suck because we still have to do helpdesk work. The helpdesk techs are on the lowest level I have seen in my career, tech and communication wise.
 My coworkers like to waste half of the day talking about Marvel with the helpdesk technicians and all other types of nonsense. (This will not improve with current management and will probably take years to turn around)
 I currently work on IT projects with other teams and my senior colleague which is interesting. But I do not get any useful input from the other junior admins, they prefer slacking off and goofing around. So, I am kind of a one-man army I have only my senior colleague as a sparring partner and he has a full schedule.
 I find it hard to stay motivated, I am the most technically knowledgeable person in IT besides the senior admin and architect. My colleagues do not show any interest in improving and I have to spoon-feed the helpdesk. So it feels like I do all the giving.
 Does anyone have any tips to deal with this?

                              <span>I work at a place where management seems to think the best way to help people progress is to give (them) helpdesk all of the keys and allow them to learn....I opposed this and so did our main sec guy. 
 We have had issues with techs changing port configs for key systems or taking things out of agg groups because they don&#x27;t understand what they are used for. Even after these mistakes I would push towards POLP and they would shoot it all down.
 Well today I&#x27;m having to rebuild an ESXi cluster due to another issue caused by untrained people having access to key systems. I&#x27;m sure when I go to the lead meeting on Wednesday they will still shoot down my suggestions.
 Who else has to deal with this nonsense? I&#x27;m all for people leveling up but a production environment is not the place for this.

                              <span>Happy holidays everyone. 
 Does anyone have any ideas to make a POE Pager device thats powered by a POE Switch smart? It needs to be rebooted every week or so and I need a way to do that remotely. I wanted to use a smart plug on a POE injector but the device is plugged into a poe switch and I&#x27;m not sure if I unplug/turn off the power to the injector will it cut the power to the device if the input to the injector is POE it will still have power from poe, right?
 Does anyone know of any other alternatives i.e. female to female RJ45 poe passthrough device that can remotely cut and restore power?

                              <span>I had posted in the Meraki sub and wanted to get everyone’s thoughts. I have been told that geolocation rules do not apply to people connecting to the VPN and for example if someone tried connecting to our network from a country we block such as North Korea or Russia and they had someone’s credentials they would have access. I can’t see how this would even be possible or even allowed? We require Duo for additional verification but I am sure there are a ton of people that don’t do this.

 I have been testing the Mapped drives Group Policy Pref in Win2k12R2 Domain Controller.
 ​
 I have no problem setting up the mapped drives But I am getting &quot;Could not reconnect all network drives.&quot; notification message.
 ​
 how do I troubleshoot why?
 ​
 ​
 GPO Setting:
 ​
 ​
 Under the GPO I have it Set to &quot;Update&quot; 
 ​
 it Points to \\ad.contoso.com\Contoso SharePoint\DeptAdmin 
 ​
 it is set to Reconnect (for persistence)
 ​
 it is Set to Map to M:
 ​
 Under the Common Tab I have :
 ​
 - Item-Level targeting - Ticked
 ​
 ------- Under Targeting I have the Security Group &quot;DeptAdmin&quot; listed
 ​
 ​
 Thanks

With no promises that power would return soon I pulled the plugs from the PDUs with visions of long bridge calls dancing in my head. 
 Fuck this shit! I proclaim as a user IMs to ask why he can&#x27;t remote in. 
 On a more serious note.... Any recommendations for drinks while recovering a VXrail with VSAN disks from an unclean shutdown on X-mas day?

Is 10.0.0.0/8 ran out of space? I&#x27;ve seen a post 7 years ago talking about this, and people still doing it, worst, more people is doing it.
 Digression: my organization uses 172.1.0.0-172.11.255.255, I am so confused.

                              <span>Hi All,
 we currently have about 25TB of files on our old file server. I will migrate to the new file server. But I have file system.
 We have VMWare ESX environment and SAN SSD Storage. 
 1 - Regardless of space and dedup capabilities, are there any other benefits for using ReFS vs NTFS?
 2 - Does anyone know if 2022 OS on the REFS file system is supported by Veeam agent ? 
 3 - Lastly, is ReFS ready for production? Stable?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been handed over an issue that is a strange one. We use AnyConnect for NAM only and F5 for our VPN.
 There&#x27;s multiple windows laptops (MACs aren&#x27;t experiencing this issue) that run into an issue in which when they disconnect from the F5 VPN or when the VPN session times out their WiFi connection will drop and AnyConnect will either sit there and say associating to their home WiFi network or say &quot;No Adaptors Available&quot;. The issue will persist until either the AnyConnect client/service is ended or the laptop is rebooted.
 Cisco TAC insists it&#x27;s not AnyConnect. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t feel like touching it since it&#x27;s 3rd party software. 
 Our client team has tried every WiFi driver they could get their hands on. They&#x27;ve tried Windows 10 and Windows 11. They&#x27;ve tried a fresh image. All resulted in the same symptoms.
 Has anyone seen these kind of issues before? Any solutions or suggestions?

                              <span>I am currently playing around with some alternative but popular platforms like pFsense/OpnSense and feel like they are throwbacks to ASAs with rules defined by intereface/vLAN etc.
 I really love the clean single list style of PaloAlto/Juniper firewalls where a rule is a rule, from and to and it works, vs building rules on a per interface basis to build things up.
 What other platforms are Zone / Flow based and in the small business price range? Any open source options?

I’m learning Azure and AWS fundamentals as well to catch up.

 I&#x27;d like to gain familiarity with Ansible and Docker/kubernetes too, as we use these in my work environment. I wonder if there is a lab environment I could build that incorporates all these elements.
 I appreciate any tips you could give!

 I configured openvpn on Fedora. I know that it&#x27;s working because when I run a traceroute command, I see the traffic taking another route when I&#x27;m connected.
 However, when I try &quot;what is my IP address&quot; in the browser, I see the same IP address, so I&#x27;m puzzled.
 Shouldn&#x27;t the IP address be different too ?
 Thank you !

                              <span>What are some good home projects I can work on to get “real world” experience. I will like to use modern frameworks and modules that enterprises are using in their network today. 
 I’m starting my automation journey soon and need some ideas! I’ve dabbled with python scripts and ansible in the past but not to much, and will be using gns3 for my topologies.

                              <span>Upcoming project will have us installing cameras on parking lot light poles. Four cameras and a weatherproof NEMA box bolted to the light pole. Inside the box will be an 8 port network switch. Switch will be connected via fiber down the pole and into buried conduit back to the main building.
 The NEMA boxes will be in direct sunlight. It&#x27;s Florida. It&#x27;s humid. And also, tt&#x27;s going to be really effing hot in those boxes.
 I&#x27;ve found a few switches rated up to 60C but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s high enough, based on our testing. Last summer, we put one of the NEMA boxes in direct sun and put a simple mechanical thermometer inside and it did in fact reach 65C/150F. 
 So... anybody got any ideas that can do PoE (only maybe 50W total) and survive these kinds of environments? Or some other way of doing this?

                              <span>I would like to set up a tftp server in AWS to provide a central place to copy equipment configurations to, from network equipment I have all over the world. 
 I am able to connect to the tftp server on udp/69 but the data transfer to copy the data on an alternate udp port seems be blocked. I have permitted all udp ports on the security group for the instance, but not luck. Does anyone know of any other location in AWS / VPC that may block udp traffic of a tftp server?
 I was able to verify that the tftp server does work. I am able to transfer data via tftp within a VPC subnet. It does not work when the traffic is coming from outside the VPC 
 Also I tested two different tftp servers, tftp64 on windows, and in.tftpd on Linux,.and the same behavior occurs on each system. 
 To reiterate. Connections on port udp/69 work. The file name comes through to the server and the server creates the file name to be written to. But the data stream that transfers the actual file data on an alternate udp port seems to be blocked and no data is written to the file. 
 I am stuck, but would like to learn more about AWS plumbing. And felt this might be a pertinent issue to other folks on this sub.

 What connections would I need specifically for this drive, SAS PCI-E card and cable would I need exactly? The software and usage I think I&#x27;m good with, its just sourcing correct compatible hardware.

But I’m not sure wether to complete the comptia big three or continue on with an Azure expert certification after.

                              <span>As the title said. We have a scheduled script where sometimes it throw an error. So far we have the error notice through email, then someone has to RDP into the centralized server and correct the script before the next scheduled time. 
 I’m thinking of postpone the script and has a medium or something to approve the script after the error has been corrected. 
 PowerAutomate seems promising with the cloud flow + desktop flow integration (premium license). Something along the line of sending email to a monitoring mailbox, extract the body, condition check the extracted body, and call desktop flow to trigger another PowerShell script. 
 Discussed internally and one guy bring up using teams to triggers power automate process. How does this works, does it work with a 1-1 chat or has to be teams channel chat. I looked up google but nothing really pin point my answer. A lot of posts hinted to a teams channel. 
 Anyone has any working automated approval process for scripting or anything similar?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m being selfish or just a total dick.
 Currently I&#x27;m the person who works most in IT support, I deal with things like networking, infrastructure, etc. I have several meetings with customers and other companies for software implementations that my company provides.
 I solve all kinds of problems and face all kinds of situations without anyone&#x27;s help.
 I see my other co-workers and they are usually wasting time on social media watching videos, memes or things like that.
 Yesterday we had a brief meeting with the head of the IT department and he said that his goal is that we all get the same payment, even knowing that their level of education is different (I have undergraduate, graduate and I&#x27;m studying to get a CCNA certificate) and the others didn&#x27;t even went to college.
 Honestly, I can&#x27;t understand why. It seems like all the effort I put in doesn&#x27;t bring any return and I&#x27;m tired of it because when things get tough I&#x27;m always &quot;need to be&quot; there to help.
 Sorry for the long text

                              <span>Any of my fellow sysadmins on call over the holidays? Just wondering how your employers handles the time like with holiday pay, comp time, etc.
 At my old job we got screwed if we had to work during a holiday week because you&#x27;d need over 8 hours before you could get anything extra because overtime and/or comp time only counted for &quot;hours worked&quot; so we&#x27;d get straight regular pay unless we worked over 8 hours.

                              <span>We started using MS Defender Plan 2 for email protection, which gave us two canned presets, Strict and Standard. I have several users on the strict policy, but I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s immutable, i.e., no granular control. And it seems to stop processing rules below its priority, so incompatible settings never get applied. For instance, it won&#x27;t allow the first contact warning tags, and it isn&#x27;t campatible with spam notifications and letting the users release their own. I don&#x27;t need all that work. So my question is: Is there anything the presets do that can&#x27;t be done by building my own policies? Can I still get the same level of impersonation protection, etc.? Thx!

 Software rollouts aren’t usually fun, especially when they’re hastily patching a production bug.
 A few lifetimes ago, my team had to move the company’s internal software to a larger server overnight without the assistance of the development team. And for bonus points, the dev team lead had a habit of not showing up during big releases and turning off his phone.
 The plan was simple:
 - Migrate to a bigger server
 - Send users to the bigger server
 - ???
 - All problems are solved
 Users were notified of the details via email, and signs were posted on the doors as they entered the office. Restart your computer, and the automated scripts will update the links to point to the new server.
 This plan did…</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 ​
 I will design DFS-N environment for my company. But I have some your valueable ideas.
 ​
 1 - (Option 1 )DFS-N multi namespaces for each department or (Option 2) DFS-N single namespace for all department. What&#x27;s best practices for this ?
 ​
 I want to config very manageable structure.
 ​
 ​
 Option 1 :

 ​
 Option 2 :

 ​
 ​
 ​
 2- What&#x27;s best practices for those permissions for DFS-N environment? I will setup something like that. 
 ​
 ​
 e.g
 ​
 ​
 DFS NameSpace Name : DATA
 ​
 ​
 Permissions : (Everyone removed, &amp; Authenticated Users &#x3D; Read) under Customize and FULL Control for Administrators
  \-- IT (Folder) --&gt; Folder Target : NS\_IT 
 NS_IT : Sharing Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 NTFS Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 ​
 ​
 ​
 3 - I will use Item-level Targeting for drive mapping. I will use Security Groups. Also I want to do the drive mapping for each department.
 ​
 So , G for IT DePartment ,H for HR Deparment and so on. 
 ​
 Lets say , any user moved from the IT department to the HR department. How can I manage the GPO here?
 ​
 ​
 Now I have tested it. I have created a GPO like below.
 ​
 But , although the user moves to the HR department, IT sharing mapping still remains.
 ​
 GPO:

                              <span>I&#x27;m sill learning the ropes and trying to understand what benefit my predecessors were after by using a 23 bit network. For a small business (120ish users and associated &#x27;stuffs&#x27;), it just seems unnecessary. What were they likely trying to gain? I only ask as it seems to catch out quite a few people when things go wrong.

                              <span>Hello all,
 We are planning to migrate Azure AD Connect from version 1.6.x to the latest version on a new server, via the staging mode method. I already did this in the past, and the process is quite straightforward.
 But in this context, this is a bit different. In the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect, ADFS was configured as the sign-in method. So, during the the AAD Connect wizard on the new server, we have to choose « Federation with ADFS » at the « Sign-in » step, and then, selecting the existing ADFS farm.
 My main concern is about the next step &quot;Azure AD domain&quot;: (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/media/how-to-connect-install-custom/adfs6.png)
 We have several federated domains, and here we can choose only one. What will be the impact for all the other ones ? And also for the one that I will select ? All these domains are already correctly federated, I don&#x27;t really understand what will happen at this step. Do we have to expect user impact ?
 Thanks for your help. Kevin

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to self host a DNS web filtering system for use at work. We outsource at the moment to a well known hosted platform in Ireland but the support is terrible and we want our own system we can manage internally. It must be a server based application and not an appliance as we host at AWS.
 I have been doing some googling and some old recommendations seems to be Squid with DansGuardian ( we prefer Linux based platforms ) but i notice DansGuardian is no longer a thing. E2Guardian seemed to take over but that also no longer seems to be active.
 Can anyone recommend a current open source platform we can use that can be cloud based on our own server.

So I installed a new SSD, cloned the main drive an it wouldn‘t boot saying something about booting in UEFI mode. The thing is it was booted in UEFI mode. So I turned some options on and off here and there and the last one was an option calley something with ROM usage. I turned it to EFI-able ROM and now the PC boots to a black screen with a white typing indicator. The BIOS icon is also way smaller than before and I can‘t access Boot-Menu or BIOS.
 If anyone could help me I would very much aprecciate it.

                              <span>This might not be a place to showcase but do you folks think this projects has a good ground? From my experience it&#x27;s useful because it can solve the following scenarios for me:
 - While interning at a company the devs were in bed and suddenly the service went down, no-one had the willingness to get up and SSH into the server and fix it. Fix was a restart. Overenergetic intern was willing but not granted SSH access since even with minimal permissions it&#x27;s a security risk and interns cannot be trusted with production server.
 - While interning as a backend dev, push to staging branch auto deployed the changes, but since maintaining SSH credentials for every employee/intern is tedious, I had to Slack call the server person and get a screenshot of logs which was a pain
 ​
 MobXcess is a tool suite that can run commands 🛠️ on your server☁️ from your mobile📱 device securely
 PS: No SSH Needed 🤫🙅‍♂️
 MobXcess is developed in two parts:
  
Server-Side system developed using Golang
 Client-Side system developed using Flutter
  
The communication is secured using AES-256-GCM cryptography.
 Since it&#x27;s a REST API, adding SSL will elevate security to a new level.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 merry xmas!
 Does anyone know if there is a source with all the IP Ranges used by Microsoft Autenticator? We would like to use the Location part of the new number-matching feature of Microsoft Authenticator.
 However, since we are using a web proxy it keeps showing a location very far away from where the user actually sits (depending on web proxy location - ZScaler in our environment). The idea would be to exclude the IPs from ZScaler in order to get real and authentic location information.
 How did you solve the issue?
 The obvious alternative would be to deactivate the location matching in the Authenticator but we actually like the feature.

                              <span>Looking at the posts joking about making changes now reminds me of a story. Working at an MSP, one of our clients was a nation wide radio station that had special uptime requirements. And naturally, like many an organization, we also had an on-call agent for weekends and holidays.
 So it is Christmas morning, I wake up to a phone call from our on-call agent who also happens to be the senior architect/engineer/sysadmin/flavor of the day. &quot;Are you still in town?&quot; Without thinking, I stupidly answered &quot;yes&quot;. That was how I got to spend Christmas day traveling hours to a rural radio tower and replacing a dead firewall.
 Turns out, everyone else was smarter than me, the architect included, and were all &quot;out of town&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a little ways into an MSP job that requires daily standup meetings that often run for 90 minutes or more. I&#x27;m making my best effort to pay attention and take notes (if for no other reason than to force myself to focus), but I often find myself tuning out anyway. And I won&#x27;t know until several minutes into a topic discussion that my boss is going to conclude the discussion by assigning the matter to me, whether or not my attention span had failed me 45 minutes into the meeting.
 Which brings me to my point: I need technology assistance here. What software solutions can the community recommend to live transcribe these meetings using the microphone on an Intel Macbook Pro? Unfortunately, it looks like the built-in Mac live caption software only works on Apple silicon. I&#x27;m willing to pay money if that&#x27;s what it takes, but hoping to avoid shelling out for full-blown Dragon.

                              <span>I feel as if Azure ADDS is extremely limited, I realize that it isn&#x27;t a replacement for ADDS, but being cloud only and having multiple vendors who use/integrate LDAP, it seems that Azure ADDS has very limited functionality. No way to integrate ADDS into Azure ATP, Cannot do custom delegation, one way sync from Azure and if I want to move groups to different OU&#x27;s, I&#x27;m having to create them in ADDS, but can&#x27;t reverse sync them to Azure, machines also don&#x27;t hybrid join, so having a hard time with intune GPOs, the list could go on...
 Recommendations? I think having devices join to AAD is great with Intune, but I don&#x27;t think being cloud-only for identities, and not having an on-prem instance is ideal.
 Ideally, I&#x27;m thinking we leave the environment in it&#x27;s current state, but move identities on-prem, including groups, and sync everything via AD Connect, while leaving machines joined to AAD, so on-prem won&#x27;t really need to be open all over with VPN tunnels flying around, just for the purpose of syncing objects, servers, VM&#x27;s, etc and far better management. Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I’m taking on a new role around mid January, this is the highest job title I have gotten so far, it involves designing, documenting and automating resources deployed on Azure, I’m well versed in log analytics and azure automation accounts and CLI to automate workflow in azure.
 What are the other tools I need to research and study? 
 How are you guys handling automation of Active Directory deployed in Azure? 
 Happy Holidays!! 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, seeking advice or experience on moving from HPE Nimble to Dell EMC Unity.
 We currently have 3 ESXi 6.7 hosts connected to a 140TB HPE Nimble CS-1000 on 10gbps iScsi. This Nimble only has 4TB of deduplication capacity. The Unity 380 we were quoted is 384TB with the first shelf (about 74TB) being all SSD, the remaining capacity is 7200 rpm HDDs. 
 Looking for advice and opinions on HPE vs. EMC in this configuration. Most of our storage usage comes from Windows 2016/19 file server VMs.
 How would you compare HPE Nimble to EMC Unity especially in regard to deduplication?
 All of our ESXi hosts are Dell R750s (upgrading from R730s)
 Thank you for any help or advice.

                              <span>I&#x27;m the middle of a 2 week notice from a position where I am the senior most individual contributor in the IT org. New job is over a 60% salary increase, better PTO, and explicitly remote. The current place made a counter offer to match and offered a 75k retention bonus paid out after 1 and 2 years in a 25/75% split. 
 The day before I had my interview scheduled, it was announced that the company was acquired. While larger, the acquiring company&#x27;s IT infrastructure is lagging behind and was hoping to leverage my company&#x27;s expertise to help modernize their systems and processes. That expertise heavily is me.
 Fuck em. I make less now than when I was hired due to inflation, and it&#x27;s like that across all departments. If you&#x27;re not at the exec level, they don&#x27;t care about CoL. I might get my piece but my team is still going to get their shit raises. And I&#x27;m just... jaded. I don&#x27;t think I could be happy with anything they offer.
 I&#x27;m spending all my time left brain dumping and documenting, I&#x27;m not going to make stuff hard for my team. I wish I could take them with me, and I&#x27;ve warned my managers that a couple of them are definitely underpaid and may lose them. 
 Best Christmas in a long time.

He explained it to the CEO and now the ceo believes no real breach occurred. Wondering how your guys companies are choosing to handle it?

Nobody verified it was complete prior to telling me this morning at 0650 and of course it wasn&#x27;t updated....fast forward to now when they are trying to run the new product, at the end of the day, before a holiday, on a Friday....data transfers aren&#x27;t communicating so everyone is freaking out.....

                              <span>I need to add some temperature monitoring to two small server rooms in two different buildings. We&#x27;re a small shop without a lot of budget for this. The Internet connection for these locations is pretty solid. 
 Ideally, I want a simple sensor we can just data cable (not WiFi) to a switch, with a basic cloud based server. It would alert us (via text, email, or app notification) when the temperature goes outside of a specified range or when it loses connectivity or fails to report within a certain time period. And last, keep a record of temperature reported so, when it loses connection, we can see what the trend was. 
 It seems to me this is a decently big ask on a small budget, but I thought I&#x27;d reach out and see if anyone has an experience or recommendations in this field. So far Google has brought up a bunch of options without much context of what is a good option and what is not.

 We&#x27;re a medium sized MSP (250 employees) and we&#x27;re currently using LastPass and in the light of what happened we&#x27;re really unsure of what service to continue with, and currently leaning towards not continuing with LastPass. But before we decide fully we want to do some evaluating on LastPass. Our Yearly subscription renews at the start of February and so we decided we want to switch to a monthly payment play in order to not commit to a full year.
 So on hold for their billing support for 1H because you cant cancel auto subscription on your own, you have to call them.
 Then they proceed to tell me that they dont have a monthly subscription, only monthly billing. Meaning I will still be committed for a year even if I pay monthly.
 So I essentially tell them that in that case I will have to cancel because I don&#x27;t want to commit for a year
 They respond with saying &quot;Go ahead cancel then because we only do yearly subscriptions&quot;.
 Honestly, hope they go under.

                              <span>I wrote a small GUI-based tool that uses the Windows Imaging Format (WIM) to create full backups of computer systems (operating system images) and then restore them.
 The application is hosted on GitHub, is open source, and is offered under the Apache 2.0 license.
 In addition, the repository includes an illustrated step-by-step guide to help get it up and running.
 Maybe someone can use the solution for their purposes as well - I would be happy. Have fun with it.
 Brief summary:
  
WIM backup always requires an external bootable media such as a USB flash drive.
 From this drive WinPE is booted to perform a backup or restore to or from an external medium (e.g. a USB hard drive).
 On the bootable USB flash drive the WinPE must be set up before (is documented illustrated in the readme).
 After completion of the respective operation, a status message is displayed whether the operation was successful or failed.
 After restoring a backup, you can boot normally from the destination drive.
 Both the backup and restore process are relatively simple (not &quot;rocket science&quot;).
 To set up the solution, you need about 30 minutes time in the best case due to the necessary downloads (e .g. ADK)

Some time in the last few months, TV decided to declare her commercial. I walked her through filling out the form and sending it in to get that lifted, they refuse and continue to disable her use.
 What alternatives are there that allow for free use?

 The computer name and license key used are listed and we don&#x27;t recognize the computer as it isn&#x27;t named the way we name our PCs.
 I email Autodesk support and get this response:
 &quot;I understand that you have gotten a verification/registration email for a computer that your organization does not recognize, my name is Dionne, and I am happy to help. However, I apologize, but we can&#x27;t see where the installations of products are made from. My apologies. 
 Best,
 Dionne-Danielle
 Autodesk Education Support&quot;
 So basically, they have no way to track where their software is installed . So they should not be relied on when they want you to pay for more licenses for more seats since they cant prove anything.
 Absolutely asinine.

                              <span>Is it worth giving the MSP life (+ a 30 min commute) a try for a year or two? 
 Some context: I like the relaxed pace of doing local in house, I can handle it well with my slight anxiety. But my current employer has 0 place to grow (after promising tons of place for growth when being hired), and after asking for a raise, I heard through the grapevine, HR/management was wanting to give my job to an offshore employee that makes $6/hr. Which they obviously didn&#x27;t when they realized that&#x27;s impossible. (I do their daily physical maintenance and support as well, basically 3 jobs in 1)
 This isn&#x27;t far from NYC btw. 
 Im always seeing horror stories in here about MSP&#x27;s but the money would be life improving. 
 Thanks in advance everyone

 I&#x27;m often at a loss to even explain why his ideas are so bad because it&#x27;s stuff that normally you don&#x27;t have to sit and articulate.
 For example, I explained to him how group policy doesn&#x27;t work if people are at home but not on the VPN, so he asked if we can expose the domain controllers to the public internet. I said no, and he asked why not, and I then had to come up with reasons which he seemed skeptical of and kept coming up with workarounds. Most of us here know why this is a b…</span>

                              <span>We are looking to upgrade our 20y old Panasonic Phone System with a new one.
 We have 2 sites, and we need on-perm solution on both of them, connected via VPN.
 Its a small company with 4 phones on one site, and 2 on the other one. So I dont think a cloud based system is worth the cost over time. Please help if you have more experience.
 Should we go with LG Ericsson iPECS? I dont see any review on iPECS systems, on the other hand lots of talk around Grandstream, but I dont really know..

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m UK based.
 I&#x27;m in the fortunate position to have a decent job as a cloud engineer, working primarily on Azure and on premise infrastructure.
 I&#x27;ve been offered 2 roles, with a varying jump in salary. 
 Role 1: 90k but as a lead on a project.
 Role 2: 75k but with a support network around, and potentially a progression plan.
 ​
 I&#x27;m quite conflicted as to what to do. I&#x27;m confident in my own abilities and like the sound of more money, but would feel like I&#x27;d benefit from a support network around me. 
 What would you guys do?

                              <span>Looking for advice on Mitel VOIP appliances. Recently joined the business and there is a Mitel VOIP appliance in play for the usual VOIP business requirements. Took a look at the setup and at first glance there is some good practice: the VOIP is hosted on linux servers sitting in their own VLAN segmented from the rest of the network. The only public facing server is the Mitel&#x27;s conference bridge suite. 
 But there is something i dont understand cause i lack experience with this VOIP software - 1) the controller is being hosted on a Windows OS, iirc its supposed to be on Linux boxes, 2) the devices are domain joined - so i assume the creds of our admins when they are logging in and out of the Windows OS VOIP controller, will be leaving their creds behind in memory no? Or even a LSASS dump could result in compromise of any domain admins that have administered the Mitel suite in the separate VLAN? Am I panicking over nothing here?
 Seems kind of obvious to me that eventually someone will pop the internet-facing conference bridge, move to the Windows OS controller server in the same VLAN, and then dump creds until they find one that can break them out of the VOIP VLAN and get into the rest of the network. 
 Any thoughts?
 Should the Mitel VOIP stuff be domain joined? 
 Should any of the VOIP VMs be a Windows OS?
 Is this setup as vulnerable as i feel it is?

                              <span>Hello,
 I would like to setup a personal lab for PowerShell practice/testing, which I can&#x27;t do at work, and for which I can&#x27;t accommodate the tin (or a VM) at home.
 Is there a facility where I can have a suitably isolated hosted VM as if an &quot;on prem&quot; DC with AD services, which I can then sync with a Tenancy in AAD/365? 
 I could just buy a vanity domain + DNS hosting, a hosted VM with Windows Server Licence, link to a Tenancy, and go from there - but even for just a half-dozen dummy users with an E1 or two thrown in, my test bed is costing a sizeable chunk of salary.
 Conversely, though, I recognise any hosting is going to incur some cost, and that&#x27;s &quot;fine&quot;.
 Any suggestions please?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 yesterday at around 3pm the our Hyper-V server started running hot and the fans were on full blast. Due to the exchange being there etc. I couldn&#x27;t restart it before 9pm from home.
 Today at 7am I arrived in the server room and it was super hot (temps said 30 degrees) so I remoted in, powered it off and unplugged it.
 I then carried up a mobile a/c and turned it on to 17 degrees, the a/c inside the server room at 18 degrees (both on high) and turned it on again.
 It&#x27;s now 12am, and the fans still run at 100%, Hyper-V manager doesn&#x27;t show any significant VM load (around 2% CPU max.).
 What could the issue be? I opened the door so cold air gets in from the floor, and the a/c&#x27;s are still running. The fans should start powering down once the room cools down, no? 
 How come it still runs at a 100% even though it&#x27;s significantly cooler there now?

 I want to use LDAPs.
 Is it enough to install the root certificate or do I also need to have the intermediate root ca in the certificate store? (On the server that does the LDAP queries).
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I have a SAN with a reported warning on the compact flash of one of the controllers. 
 The spare part shoud be the code 768079-001; however I cannot find it here, only shipped from USA or something.
 So, my question is, can I use a random-industrial-grade CompactFlash or the HP one is needed? And second question, can I use a bigger one? the 16GB is 5 times cheaper than the 4GB for example.
 Obviously I&#x27;m only looking at industrial grade high level CFs, not the cheap 10$ ones for cameras

                              <span>HI all,
 ​
 Looking for genuine opinions whether Microsoft Unified Support is bringing you value for money if you are using it.
 Yes it is quite pricey, but we are going all in in Azure and 365 and have struggled with getting good quality support from partners so are looking for alternatives.
 Most times we get support from MS, the initial engagement is problematic, but once I start having conversations (moaning...) with our MS account managers and they escalate the incidents to the right person, issues get resolved promptly. It appears that having Unified Support may well get you to the &#x27;right person&#x27; quickly. 
 ​
 Cheers

                              <span>Right now, at our small shop, if our router goes down, we lose all access to the network. It’s only happened during blackouts or a total loss of networking. Since everyones WFH, and I’m a distant remote, I have to wait for one of my coworkers to head into the office and start things back up. If my boss came down with HBBS (hit by bus syndrome), we would have an even harder time.
 What do you guys use?

The first sync time was 12:12 at night. Although we did not make any settings changes regarding this, it started to not receive new updates. By the way, when we synced manually, it was getting new updates but showing its status &quot;fail&quot;. When I changed the sync time yesterday, I saw that new updates have arrived but its status still shows as &quot;fail&quot;. How can i solve this problem. I don&#x27;t want to reinstall wsus server. Is there anything I can do? Thanks in advance. Best wishes.

                              <span>What is everyone using for file servers these days? 
 100 user company on 365 business premium, hybrid environment, roughly 10TB of data, hosted on-prem right now.
 What is the easiest lift that can keep file/folder permission in place and allows easy mapping via GPO? I&#x27;m working on getting Intune/AutoPilot set up, testing how the enrollment process works in a hybrid environment now. Haven&#x27;t seen to many examples for hybrid specific in my research, but I digress. 
 Obviously we have a company OneDrive, I believe 1 TB for biz prem, I would think you could increase the capacity for a fee. Issue is permissions are not a one to one from my understanding. SharePoint is also an option but again, kind of a mess for management in my limited experience. And now there is Azure Files, that seems promising but being my first foray into Azure, seems pricey. 
 Ideally I don&#x27;t want to redo any permissions and need to have a reliable way to map drives for users. Curious to see what others have done. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am in the process of revamping our service desk team to shift their mindset from reactive to tickets coming in the desk to proactive with a focus on ticket reduction through anticipating customer needs, automation to streamline/free You resources and delivering white glove service.
 I am curious to hear any success stories on areas you’ve focused and seen great success in addition to red flags/issues that came up with unintended consequences.
 Some of the areas of focus for 2023 are: - improve work from home experience and technology performance - conduct a monthly “check up” With all employees with at least 3 being video - revamp onboarding experience and shorten day 1 orientation timeframe - while supporting an issue, proactively review drivers/vulnerabilities/windows updates and address those before logging off.
 These are just a few examples of ways that we’re focused on prevention/proactive/mindset shift
 Any feedback on things that have/have not worked for you?
 Greatly appreciate the insight.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently working as IT support, and most of the issues I get reported end up being because of simple windows 10 updates, I was wondering is there a way to modify something on each computer so they force update every time there&#x27;s any kind of update, I want this computers to search and install updates the moment they are turned on. there&#x27;s already a policy on the active directory but is not that efficient and I don&#x27;t have the authority to modify it yet and even if i had the authority it&#x27;s not that efficient... If you guys know a proven way to archive this please let me know, I think this would help a lot of people working as IT support around the world.

 Long story short been at this company for about 6+ months that’s just a one man show (aka me) and just feels like they are abusing it and not getting the help I need. Other positions I’ve had is either MSP or in healthcare where it’s a hit or miss when it comes to pay. 
 Been in a salary position for the last 3+ years but been offered a job where it’s more pay but it’s an hourly pay vs salary. Any suggestions on how to go about this?

                              <span>My 3 year old PockEthernet device has served me well over 3 years now. But this past week it will no longer do TDR cable length testing. It spins and spins like it is testing, but the fields are blank and no results ever show up. The wire map test still functions fine. So has my $180 cable tester has just became a basic wire map tester going forward? 
 Anybody experience this TDR testing issue with theirs? 
 The iOS app crashes more and more often as the phone gets updated, but I have learned to live with it so far.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t really enjoy programming and writing code.
 I think there is a need for every engineer to do some basic scripting as it can save a significant amount of time. I can appreciate the skill, but I just haven&#x27;t been able to bring myself to enjoy it.
 Working with python and go have just felt awful for me, especially the xml, json and expect stuff.
 Shell scripting feels a bit more natural since I don&#x27;t spend time reinventing the wheel on a ton of functions and I can just pipe to other programs. It&#x27;s like a black box. I throw in some input and out comes what I need. It&#x27;s not without it&#x27;s issues either.
 Writing code with python and go feels more like this

 I&#x27;m curious what eventual upgrades I could do via optics/switch upgrade, but I&#x27;m not sure what the fastest BiDi speeds would be. 
 I see 25G-SFP28 exists so it looks like 25G is an option, but is there any higher or would it become QSFP at that point?

 I work in IT and would say i understand a good amount of networking, although its not my primary field (collab) - i know how BGP, RIP or OSPF work, the difference between distance vector and link state routing protocols, bla bla, CCNA&amp;CCNP covered all that. But when it comes to WAN routing i feel like a toddler. I have colleagues who work with SD-WAN and i dont understand a lot. I can understand the concept of each hop just looking for the best route individually, which might not always be the best route, which gave birth to the VPN ads we all know.

 New IT Director wants me to &quot;Spin up a Guest Wi-Fi&quot;. They want this to be 100% isolated from the intranet. Our environment is relatively simple - We run SonicWall firewall for any external communication, with a L3 core switch for all internal routing. Server stacks on each floor for access. Ruckus with Virtual Smart Zone for the AP&#x27;s/controller. This is true for all (8) locations. Our uplink to the SonicWall is through VLAN 60, which is also our corporate Wi-Fi. All AP&#x27;s are untagged for VLAN 60, as is the SonicWall uplink. 
 They&#x27;re not looking to spend any money or add any new equipment for this task, and would like it done early next week. Its Friday, so about 2 working days. They would ideally like something ready for testing in about... an hour.

                              <span>Hello and Happy Holidays. I have a Mikrotik CCR2216 router and a Cisco Meraki MS355-24 switch that I&#x27;d like to interconnect at greater than 10Gbps speeds with no bonding. 
 The CCR2216 has 2x QSFP28 ports capable of 100Gbps, and 12x SFP28 ports capable of 25Gbps.
 The MS355-24 has 4x QSFP ports capable of 40 Gbps.
 What are my options for interconnecting these two devices? They&#x27;ll be on top of each other in a cabinet so DAC is an option. 
 Any help with this setup is greatly appreciated! Thank you.

I see dropped traffic which mentions in the description that traffic was dropped between the source and destination but in the Rule Number/Name fields these are blank. I have a rule to allow said traffic and am curious what is going on here? Is there a legitimate reason for this type of behaviour?

I&#x27;ve got two firewalls I am migrating to ACI as-is, problem is they are not in the same broadcast domain and will need a middle man to route their prefixes. The guide generally out there deals mostly with dynamic routing protocols. Does anyone have experience ddeployting L3out to L3out ? or has a pretty firm grasp of how it is deployed

 So, I have a bare metal server in the cloud running Proxmox. The server has a single NIC witha public IP. The VM connect to the network via bridges that has separate subnets (vmbr0, vmbr1 and so on)
 All VMs have Internet and networking working just fine. I have forwarded ports for RDP and SSH and can connect to them just fine from the outside, all made with simple iptables commands put /etc(netwrok/interfaces.
 One of these VMs is running a service that needs to send notifications to client devices (apps on PC or smartphone). These VM are running a website serving a particular service, behind a reverse proxy.
 This notifier software is difficult though. I&#x27;ve forwarded port 8081 on the host machine to the VMs port 80 (to bypass…</span>

                              <span>Hi All
 I have been tasked with upgrading the fleet of Office 365 Installs for 80~ Devices.
 These devices all are using office 365 2013 Pro Plus Im needing to upgrade them all to Pro plus 2019.
  
I have generated an installer and an xml file from config.office.com. 
 I have downloaded all the relevant files with the /download switch in the batch file
  
Im having some issues when it comes to trying to install
  
My install O365.bat file is located in \\DC\netlogon\Office Deployment Upgrade: https://imgur.com/a/MKfK17F I have the @pushd and @popd in this batch file becuase the file is in a network location. It was the only way I could allow this file to be ran on an end user machine
 When I run this file I get an error message around the files not being able to be downloaded: https://imgur.com/a/Ouw61rt
  
Im also needing to figure out how to push this batch file once and only once so it only uninstalls 2013 and upgrades once. Wether I use PDQ or a one time scheduled task im not sure. 
 I have been at this for days and im yet to figure it out
 If anyone can assist that would be great
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi;
 I&#x27;m a technical trainer with Atlanta transit. Before I was a trainer, I was a technician that maintained the SCADA system, so I&#x27;m familiar with electronics, computers, and networking. I gained some certifications along the way (A+, Net+, Linux Essentials).
 I&#x27;m currently studying Python and Linux administration. I&#x27;m looking for a volunteer opportunity for Linux system administration, to apply what I know and learn more. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks

                              <span>Are you ready for this nightmare story?
 I have a Virtual environment (VMWare, Microsoft) and lost everything on the SAN including VMs and backups. Data recovery is in the process but it will take weeks at best and I am not getting any high confidence from the data recovery team. I have an online backup of user data but no viable backup of the actual DC or any other servers that I can restore. I say that, but there is a remote possibility that I can restore my DC from 6 months ago when we upgraded from 2008 to 2022 and swapped roles, etc., however, that is looking like a pipe dream as well (this would be the 2008 server).
 It is a Hybrid Office 365 environment with on-prem DCs and Azure AD (free) for authentication and all. I am assuming that if I were to create everything from scratch (new Forest and DC) there is a high likelihood of all mailboxes getting affected as well because the on-prem SIDs and GUIDs and Object IDs would be different from what they were previously. Waiting for weeks isn&#x27;t happening but I need at least some domain functions back to survive the carnage.
 I am looking for some bright ideas to get out of this mess!!!!
 My terrible options at the moment are:
  
Create everything from scratch and deal with hybrid issues later
 Hope and try to restore the DC from 6 months ago and minimize the impact to only new users from that point on.
 Can Azure AD be the savior here? - Can the information in the cloud be used to spin up a DC in the cloud? - If that is possible, does this mean I am not fully cloud-based domain environment, or can I then also have an on-prem spun up later?
  
I am sure there are some bright minds out there to help navigate this mess.
 Thank you!!!!

                              <span>Almost a year ago, my manager let me know he was going to be moving to another team and my department director would like to promote me to my manager&#x27;s position. Nice! Over the following months this shifted to, &quot;we have to post the position and you&#x27;ll need to apply, but you&#x27;re our candidate of choice.&quot; Interviews were earlier this month and I didn&#x27;t make it past the first round of interviews. My director pulled me aside afterwards to say that I interviewed well, but he had decided to look for someone with more experience. It sucks but business can be that way, I&#x27;ll just keep my resume updated.
 ​
 Later, it was dropped that the new manager won&#x27;t be meeting with our team at any point during the interview process. This manager will also report to two directors; during my interview it became clear they had directly opposing ideas of what the new manager should achieve, (director 1 said it would be the new manger&#x27;s job to take on work from their team and say no to new work from director 2, director 2 said exactly the opposite), and it very much gave me &quot;divorced parents arguing through the kids&quot; vibes.
 ​
 After thinking about this for a bit, I never would entertain an offer like this if it had come from another organization. If I was applying for a manager role and couldn&#x27;t meet the team at least once and was expected to report to multiple directors with directly opposing expectations, I never would consider the role!
 ​
 While it sucks that I was strung along for so long, I&#x27;m grateful that it helped me see that this probably wasn&#x27;t a position I would be happy with, and that a healthy organization probably wouldn&#x27;t make these kinds of decisions.

 We use connect wise so I can open a command prompt.. anyway to do it thru there?
 Note: I really hate doing these type of tickets I’ve only had to do things like this maybe 2-3 times in my 7 year IT career

These encrypted fields remain secured with 256-bit AES encryption and can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key derived from each user’s master password using our Zero Knowledge architecture. As a reminder, the master password is never known to LastPass and is not stored or maintained by LastPass.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I have one domain in the forest, and the domain currently has 4 Domain controllers. One DC is obviously holding the FSMO roles. I just noticed that the FSMO role holder is also a GC. Now in the past i&#x27;ve never paid any mind to this, and the domain seems fine... for years even. But Looking at the microsoft instructions for moving FSMO roles, they clearly state: &quot;Do not put the infrastructure Master FSMO role on a GC&quot;.
 Why? My domain seems to be running fine. Whats the difference between a DC that is not a Global Catalog, and one that isnt? Can it still be used the same way?
 I only have one DC at this particular site, if i switch off GC, will everything still function correctly?(Auth, Kerberos, etc).
 ​
 My other Domain controllers are also Global catalogs.

 We have some customizations that rely on the browser being synced to the corporate account. Extensions and PWAs aren&#x27;t present until the browser is synced. We want to delay those customizations until the user has logged into the browser.
 Anyone know a way, or have any ideas where I can start poking?

                              <span>If there&#x27;s a better subreddit for this let me know, but I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble and dealing with very poor documentation and hoping someone else has tried this. 
 I am primarily the video guy at an arts center, but since my venue went to NDI I have also become the defacto sysadmin for our dedicated video network. It&#x27;s not fancy - we have a Netgear M4250 managed switch driving the network, and then a bunch of CAT6 run through the walls to our endpoints. I&#x27;m trying to add wireless for easier troubleshooting and access to the GUIs for my devices. I thought this would be easy (lol). That&#x27;s the context, now here&#x27;s the problem:
 I have installed the Ubiquiti Unifi Network application on my Windows 10 laptop, plugged both the laptop and the U6-LR into the switch (PoE+ capable), and am trying to &quot;adopt&quot; it to my Unifi network on the Windows app. That&#x27;s what the documentation covers. However, the adoption always fails, then asks me to &quot;enter the device credentials that were set on the previously installed location under network device ssh authentication.&quot; Except that I didn&#x27;t set any of that - this thing is brand new out of the box. I press the &quot;forget&quot; button, which says &quot;the device will be restored to facotry settings&quot;. That sounds like exactly what I need, but in practice it just starts this loop over again. Same if I hit the hardware reset button. Adoption failed.
 I&#x27;m stumped. Does anybody have any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                              <span>Our company has made some changes to tighten what messages can and cannot come through. We have added DMaRC and DKIM as one should. 
 Our users have recently been receiving undeliverable messages stating they are the sender and recipient. Mainly because of the way the mail flow rule is setup against dmarc failures. 
 Clearly the messages are phishing. I’m wondering the best way we could handle these? I was thinking I just create a mail flow rule to say if anyone inside the organization receives a message with the body text matching what the custom NDR rule outputs to just drop the message. 
 Thoughts?

 Is anyone else having similar issues? I searched and at this time I am not seeing any reports from anyone else at this time.

                              <span>I understand that overall solution may not be optimal however, hope to be given an advice how to configure it with the limited resources that are already in place.
 There is a situation that has to be resolved:
 In AD there is a file server srv002 with shared folders Folder1, Folder2, etc.
 The server is running out of space. It was decided to add another server srv003 which has sufficient disk space and use DFS to &#x27;distribute&#x27; data between the servers.
 The other intention is not to change paths to which users have got used.
 Is that all possible?
 I am testing with one of the shared folders that exists and cannot get the same namespace...
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new in my role. Graduated with a year of work experience in IT and went straight into systems administration, have been doing it for almost 2 months. But god it feels so much longer than that. I&#x27;m also the only IT person at an organisation with ~250 people.
 A lot of people lack basic IT skills, which is totally fine, that&#x27;s why we have IT people. Except they get so mad when I ask them to make sure their username/password is correct, or if their cable is in properly or if they&#x27;re trying to log into the right platform. People don&#x27;t understand resolving IT issues isn&#x27;t always instantaneous and sometimes we need to wait for equipment to be delivered. It seems that I&#x27;m often expected to resolve everything Right Now and people get frustrated and upset when that doesn&#x27;t happen. 
 It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming to be honest, and I&#x27;m still trying to wrap my head around everything. I got 3 day of training before the last sysadmin left. I&#x27;m not sure how you guys deal with people who are rude/impatient/irritated. I also get frustrated at the bad communication and poor common sense. Anyone got any advice for this?

                              <span>Hello.
 I have a cheap dell t310 with hba sas card and 16gb ram with a zfs1 pool on n°4 sas HD 4tb 7200 rpm each without compression.
 I use proxmox on dell perc raid with 4ssd raid5 hardware managed, where I run some VM and container saved inside the SSD lvm raid and the zfs pool is only for my works files storage with samba with a 2gbps network bonding.
 Also I have an unused 4 old 10k sas disk of 250gb each.
 My question is: - the zfs1 pool has 3X read speed gain but no write speed gain.
 Want to have the sense to install one small sas 10k as a log disk for zfs to speed up write operations?
 If yes, I can work only with a LOG disk or if I add a log also I need to add a cache disk?
 Really thank you

                              <span>Does anyone have a recommendation for a software package for purchase order management. I do not require something complex.
 The kind of functionality I need is basically a database of what orders and invoices we have, but then some form of dashboard showing which ones are coming up for review/renewal. I did my research and came across Tradogram. Has anyone ever used them before?

                              <span>Pretty much covered by the title. Got a VM that&#x27;s chucked up a warning for corruption, one person reckons we can just run CHKDSK /F /R /X in the VM, someone else reckons we should turn the VM off, mount it, then run it.
 Really it comes down to: does anyone have to stay late tonight to run the mounted chkdsk out of hours

                              <span>First off; yes, SMBv1 bad. Not my decision.
 I hope the hive mind has some input on this.
 We have a legacy application that uses SMBv1. We have recently stood up a new site in AD with a new domain controller. Devices in this site are unable to open the SMB share via \\hostname, but are able to connect via \\IP.-.add.ress.
 Wireshark shows me &quot; KRB5KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOSUPP &quot;, but zero configuration changes between the devices in site A and site B. I&#x27;ve literally moved VM&#x27;s from one site to another and have it work in A but not B).
 Site A:
  
DC running server 2019
 XP SMBv1 share
 Clients can connect to SMB share
  
Site B:
  
DC running server 2022
 clients cannot connect to SMB share
  
​
 As a test, I&#x27;ve associated the subnets of Site B with site A in AD sites &amp; services. After a reboot, the devices are able to connect to the SMB share.
 So that leads me to believe there&#x27;s an issue with the DC in site B, but I&#x27;m unsure what/where.
 ​
 Any tips would be very welcome!

                              <span>Hey there!
 I am a junior Sysadmin for a NGO and we are planning to upgrade our network infrastructure.
 We are using D-Link managed switches (layer 3 functionallities for backbone, access layer 2, ..) and I was looking for good, sustainable alternatives. The D-Link swiches are doing their job but they aren´t that good to handle for my favour.
 While looking up some alternatives I´ve noticed that I dont know that much about the differences between switches from different manufactures.
 Since I´m rarely active in this Community I though I just ask you and maybe join the discussion.
 Maybe some of you could list their favourite piece of hardware they love working with and shortly state why? :)
 It would be nice to get some advice for middleclass price options aswell.
 ​
 Thank you in advance for you contibution!

                              <span>I started working in my first IT job and I&#x27;ve been working in a very high performing team. 
 I&#x27;m a noob, straight out of Uni and doesn&#x27;t really have any experience. Work has been getting hectic lately and there is a good chance that I might get fired/ let go.
 TBH I&#x27;m mentally exhausted as well. It&#x27;s just everyone is really smart and I feel like I&#x27;m being a dead weight. 
 My boss/manager is a really kind person. They really want me to succeed and encourage me a lot. But I feel like it&#x27;s a bit too late for that. There is a pretty good chance that I might be let go due to my performance. 
 I was wondering that, how bad would it look if I get fired from my very first IT job?
 Considering the situation, how can I make it as easy as possible for everyone.?
 Any advice or help would be appropriated.

 The SOAR we are going to use is Shuffle.
 What can be achieved with those integrations and what are the differences? How do those systems work together in the SOC environment? 
 Are the cases updated automatically in TheHive with the information from MISP/Cortex or should they be configured to be updated automatically if certain conditions are matched with a SOAR?
 Is it a good practice to use both MISP and Cortex?

 “com.vmware.vcenter.trustmanagement.impl.InvalidArgumentException: java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: http://localhost:1080/external-vecs/http1/XXX-XXX-adfsservername.XXX.local/443/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration”
 I ensured that the ADFS is working via this (internal) link: https://xxxadfsservernamexxx.local/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx
 I believe this is an issue with the certificate. That is because during trial and error I got different errors related with the certificate. Like: &quot;Error occurred while adding trusted root certificates&quot;&quot;com.vmware.vapi.std.errors.Error&quot; &quot;Certificate bearing subject&quot;&quot;is not a valid CA certificate&quot;&quot;Please retry with a valid certificate chain&quot;.
 We have a CA in the domain and newly created Windows 2022 ADFS server. 
 I have followed the steps in this link: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78029
 But there is no clear instructions on what certificate to export and import or how to generate one or whatsoever. I am missing this part. Do I need to get a certificate from ADFS server? From the CA server? What format? How to export? What is a chain? Any idea on how to handle this?

                              <span>Yes, I will post this in the IT Careers subreddit as well, but I feel like this sub has helped me incredibly and I greatly respect the opinions of us folk who are in the trenches daily.
 I took a position as a entry level help desk technician at an MSP a few years ago with no experience. I was stagnant in my previous line of work and wanted to try something new (I’m in my mid 30s). In a few years, I’ve learned a LOT, obtained the triad of CompTIA certs, VMware cert, CCNA, and some Azure certs. I assist in managing our VIP clients, and have been promoted 4 times to get near the top of the food chain on the help desk (about 50 of us).
 I love the type of work I do and it just clicks for me, but a huge downside for me is OT. I understand there is OT for every position out there. That’s part and parcel of work. But the daily 1-3 hours (and weekends) of maintenance and troubleshooting the inevitable issues that arise from that work each night is just something I will not continue to do. Give me 40-42 hours a week. Take your money. I want the time off, away from the office. I’m not going to spend 12 hours a day working when I have a wife and 2 kids at home. It’s just too much, I’m burnt out quickly, and I can’t give my family my full, undivided attention they deserve on a daily basis.
 Are there any options out there for me that I can work my way to that is a more traditional “9-5” job in the IT world? When I’m done for the day, I want to leave my work at work. Obviously a sysadmin role at a company is out of the question. Am I more suited for a solutions role or pre sales? Sales? Account management? I’ve only been in the industry for 5 years so I’m fairly new to what options may even be available for me, if any. So I’m at the point where I need to decide if another career move may be needed. 
 Any advice at all would be appreciated!

 Currently using Microsoft 365 Business Premium. 
 We need it so if a laptop leaves the building WiFi it stops working, or if they try to logon via a different device from a different wan IP it doesn&#x27;t work etc.
 Thanks in Advanced!

I&#x27;ve moved to openssh ever since it&#x27;s been included in Windows. VSCode uses my SSH Config and it would be great, if there where a terminal or session manager that would as well.
 I don&#x27;t need tons of features. Saving sessions would be enough. Doesn&#x27;t even need Credential management, as that&#x27;s done through ssh config and keys.
 Is there anything for windows that doesn&#x27;t rely on putty?

                              <span>Hello all! As the title suggests ive been tasked to look for a self-service tool that provides temporary local admin rights. Right now all of our users have local admin rights on their work devices which is a security risk we would like to mitigate.
 Points to consider are:
  
straight forward administration of the tool
 the tool should be easy to understand for the user
 there should be a way to evaluate who / when / how long someone requsted local admin rights
 it should be possible to determine the duration of the requested admin rights
 Company of about 200 - 300 users
 We are using Microsoft 365 E3
  
Questions we asked ourselves are:
  
Why do coworkers actually need local admin rights?
 can the tool / software be automatically be updated with our images without admin rights?
 can devicedrivers still be installed with manufacturer tools like Dell SupportAssist?
  
As it stands right now in my research on the subject i stumbled upon the tool EAM (Emergency Admin Manager) from dynasys, which looks kind of promising.
 I was curious if any of you have a useful suggestion or better solution to my problem at hand (im still fairly inexperienced and just started my first job)
 im grateful for any help, thank you very much!

 Using the latest build of Purple Knight by Semperis, I&#x27;m unable to view/save the PDF report. It seems that the new build is unable to generate the PDF file, I always get a message &quot;Failed to save security assessment report. Internal Error.&quot; or &quot;Failed to save security assessment report - Object reference not set to an instance of an object&quot;.
 The previous build was working correctly on the same machine.
 Anyone with the same issue?

                              <span>Hi all Got a call this morning from a prospective customer who is in pretty bad shape. 
 Ransomware&#x27;d, majority of data lost and no backups. They switched off all on-prem domain controllers soon as one of their techs noticed weird behaviour.
 Their only saving grace are two domain controllers running in Azure, showing no signs of infection and pretty segregated away from their on-premise environment and adequately backed up.
 I&#x27;ve been brought in as a secondary pair of eyes to relieve the pain on the lone tech on the ground.
 I&#x27;d be grateful if you could validate our approach below and any suggestions and pointers you could provide to work around any dangers you may see.
 Approach I&#x27;m thinking of taking is, once we&#x27;re 100% the DCs in the cloud are unimpacted
  
Build clean network
 
Perform authoritative restore of the dc in the cloud into a new on-premise virtual machine
 
Install AD and configure roles onto the new VM
 
Restore system state data from the backup to new VM using Windows Backup Utility
 
Boot new VM into DRSM and run ntdsutil command to start Directory Services Utility
 
Use authoritative restore sub-command to mark relevant objects as authoritative
 
Commit, restart
 
Perform deep AD Health Check
 
 In terms of FSMO roles - unfortunately they were all on one of the on-prem domain controllers, now powered down - would this simply be a case of seizing the roles once I&#x27;ve configured the new on-prem DC properly?

 I&#x27;ve been working at an MSP but as a consultant for a sister company that sells ERP. My job is solving technical issues (most of the time small network probs or an update that gets stuck), and some internal helpdesk.
 I&#x27;ve been offered a job at a place for internal IT with a 33.3% raise in pay. When i offered my dismissal HR replied kinda cold, no counteroffer what so ever.
 Now one day before i leave i got an offer with a raise of 50% with a car in the package.
 I&#x27;m at a crossroads here and i was hoping I would get some opinions on what i should do.
 Help?

 For reasons I won’t go into, I’m in a need to setup a M365 subscription (E3 Enterprise, likely with the security addons on later) pretty quickly for a business which will host ~1000 users. 
 For these subscriptions, I need to contact the Microsoft sales team. I’ve done this but they’ll take a few days to get back to me (which over Christmas will likely take a bit longer)

 Are there any other ways of spinning up this tenant without engaging a human?
 I’ve noticed E3 Business subscriptions can be done directly from the portal. Can I just sign up for this and then upgrade? Or is this going to cause issues later?

 Any other options appreciated :)

                              <span>We&#x27;re a fairly small shop. Staffed mostly by young developers. We like to have fun when we can, in the past this was done by playing URT on slow days or before holidays. In the last two years there&#x27;s been a lot of turnover and current folks just aren&#x27;t into it damn kids.
 So after sneakily gathering intel for the last two months I&#x27;ve gathered that they ALL like to play minecraft. Surprise!
 So, tomorrow as a end of the year gift the company will be playing a Ya-dead-ya-dead minecraft game in a server I spent today building. We&#x27;re confident most employees have already purchased the game but I&#x27;ve gotten an approved PO to purchase a personal copy for any employee who doesn&#x27;t so they can join in, and it&#x27;s theirs. Ties to their personal accounts. 
 I spent the day preparing a full java minecraft package, to deploy at 11:59pm tonight to all systems, and have a custom message that will be pushed at 10am directing users play some minecraft and join xyz server. 
 Once they join everyone will start at a specified point with some messages to read regarding the &quot;game&quot;. They&#x27;ll have the entier day to build the most elaborate home + an attempt to reach &quot;the end&quot;. Most likely nobody will get there as its hardcore. Also, if you die you&#x27;re dead. They&#x27;ve all been provided a named box with the same supplies to help them get started, food and a map.
 Its not much but I&#x27;m really happy I was able to get this approved and am able to give the company a few hours of fun before the holidays.
 Any ideas on change to the theme of the game for more fun? I thought YDYD would lead to good braging rights theme. We do have some sales, Admin, and HR folks but they&#x27;re already all GONE for the holiday. It&#x27;s literally just a bunch of very young devs and myself for tomorrow.

                              <span>What are some of the most notoriously difficult issues to troubleshoot? Like if you knew this issue manifested on someone or anyone’s network, you’d expect it to take 3-6 months for the network team to actually resolve the issue, if they’re damn good. You’d expect it to be a forever issue if they’re average.

address space is currently /28 from one provider (just peering address for other)
 Two CERs, Two firewalls (HA or Active-Active still to be determined) One collapsed core switch (multiple access layer switches) 
 All participating in OSPF (eBGP and IBGP at CERs)
 
 Only receiving default route from both providers

                              <span>Hello, i have a dhcp server in my LAN1 and i want to distribute dhcp to my LAN2 with the LAN1 server.
 So i set up a dhcp relay in my stormshield, specify the LAN1 server and the interfaces that&#x27;s im listening to.
 But my LAN2 isn&#x27;t getting any IP. I ran a tcpdump on my stormshield and i can see the DHCP DISCOVER frames being relayed to my server but he is not responding to theses DISCOVER, can you guys help me understand ?
 Thanks :)
 BTW i&#x27;m on hyperV

                              <span>Hi,
 we are running a OLD fileserver (Windows Server 2012R2) with a really big multiple data-disk (D:\ , E:\, G:\, H:\ ,J:\ , M:\) of round about 6,5 TB. This server is virtualized by VMware. We will migrate my old file server to Windows Server 2022. My question is :if I put in different VLANs for each file server , will there be any performance issues? 
 We have Checkpoint FW. Also , We have 10G network infrastructure. (Cisco Nexus Switch)
 Thanks,

                              <span>First I am just a dumb electrician, who recently had to run fiber between two switches. The fiber tested good between the two switches, but the vendor is saying the fiber is no good, because the switches will not communicate with each other, but will show activity if you connect to GBIC ports together via short patch on the same switch. What am I missing, and yes I did swap the tx and rx on the patch cable just in case it was crossed somewhere.

                              <span>I have the below topology on GNS3, where each rectangle represents a different VLAN. Now I want a NAT scheme that steers packets from VLAN1 from one connection, while packets from VLANs 2 to 6 are steered through a different connection than VLAN. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can implement this?
 Note: The clouds there are not doing anything they are just part of an attempt.

                              <span>From what I know and can tell, 400 gigabit is 50 gigabytes per second. PCIE 4.0 X16 can only do 32 gigabyte per second. So how do 400 gigabit NICs achieve full speed? Can they even? Or is 400 not symmetrical? Just total? I’m really curious and I haven’t been able to find an answer

                              <span>I have two servers with their own 10gb NICs installed and I&#x27;m trying to get an iperf test to make sure all looks good. The issue is that I can&#x27;t make the connection. I&#x27;m using openmediavault as my server and in it I&#x27;ve configured the main port of each NIC with it&#x27;s own IP.
 Server 1 NIC IP &#x3D; 172.16.61.8 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 Server 2 NIC IP &#x3D; 172.16.61.9 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 ​
 On server 1 I&#x27;m running this on iperf:
 iperf3 -s -B 172.16.61.9
 ​
 On server 2 as the client:
 iperf3 -c 172.16.61.9 -B 172.16.61.8
 ​
 But when I run this it just hangs for 2 minutes and then says &#x27;iperf3: error - unable to send control message: Bad file descriptor&#x27;
 ​
 What am I missing here? I&#x27;m calling the IP for the server&#x27;s 10gb nic and establishing my local server&#x27;s 10Gb IP as well but just not making a connection

                              <span>Guys, I’ve searched everywhere and couldn’t find a working solution. Here’s my quest. 
 I have a device connected to network 1 which uses mDNS for auto discovery. These network attached devices are only accessible by its software application. 
 I need to be able to VPN into network 1 and access the network devices via their software.
 What I’ve done so far; 
 I’ve got a L2TP vpn to work between the two and I see the device via IP. But can’t access the device since the proprietary software doesn’t see it. (mDNS / Bonjour doesn’t transfer over VPN)
 What are my options here ? How can I make it work. Do I need any specific hardware ? 
 Thanks

 Concerning fiber links especially Fiber To The Home GPON designs. It is common to have 20 KM SFPs at each end of a fiber link. If the fiber link is more than 20 KM and all of the transmit and receive light levels are within spec, what kind of issues will this cause? 
 Some fiber links have a 60 KM SFP on one end and a 20 KM SFP on the other end. I&#x27;m not sure what issues this will cause either assuming all of the transmit and receive light levels are within spec.
 I appreciate any help.

                              <span>I converted a 9130axi to an EWC and when I try to join another AP to the controller it joins, then goes away. I console to the AP that joined and now it&#x27;s also a controller. Is this normal or is the EWC sending the controller image to the member AP&#x27;s?
 If this is not right, how do I turn them back to capwap AP&#x27;s? The guide says to just issue ap-type capwap but that command isn&#x27;t available. I also tried factory resetting but it keeps booting to the EWC partition.

 The switch at the middle school is a Cisco and the switch at the primary building is an old 3com
 When looking at at the Cisco it alerted me with
 %SPANTREE-2-PVSTSIM_FAIL: Blocking root port Te1/0/43: Inconsitent inferior PVST BPDU received on VLAN 7, claiming root 32775:00a5.bf25.d800
 The config on te1/0/43 is

 On the 3com the config is

 port trunk permit vlan 7 to 8 70 128 157 200
 port trunk pvid vlan 305

 description &quot;Uplink to MS 1G&quot;
 I&#x27;m not sure where to begin troubleshooting as this has.never been an issue before. What am I missing?
 Apologies for formatting I&#x27;m on my phone.

 I&#x27;m looking for community opinion and experience related to the 6wind products in general, particularly with 6wind vsr solutions.
 I&#x27;ve been testing it pretty intensively and already have some understanding. However, it would be nice if anybody can share their experience with the company and its products.
 For now, my specific case is a branch VPN router, but I have a few more places where they might fit, just lack external information and have to stick to their corporate website only.

                              <span>How important is it to shape / rate limit the interface of a WAN connection to the actual bandwidth?
 Example: I have a 200Mbps L2 circuit plugged in to a 1Gb port on an Arista switch. There&#x27;s a bunch of output discards and I found myself wondering if it best practice (or would even make a difference) to shape the interface down to 200000Kbps. I attempted to do this as a test (rate shape 200000 kbps) and it didn&#x27;t change the incrementing output discards (but I&#x27;m fairly certain I&#x27;ve still read this as best practice before).
 Any guidance on this one appreciated. Thank you!
 [EDIT]: I&#x27;m also (now) fairly certain my config was wrong as rate shape doesn&#x27;t do anything without QoS queues defined, but I&#x27;m still curious about the best practice aspect. I believe this is how I&#x27;d do it on Arista (?): Rate Limit on Arista switch

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have something like this across 2 data centres (green is Site A, yellow is Site B): https://i.imgur.com/nKKrVnN.png . The 2x2 ToR switches are OS10, and I&#x27;m new to them. 
 Each site has its own edge so internet bound traffic is always directed from the 2 switches to their respective local firewall as their default g/w. 
 Is it then possible to configure the ToR switches to monitor an internet IP and if it is down, change their default gateway? 
 Take for instance the green side. I want 172.30.0.11 and 172.30.0.12 to monitor an internet ip (say 8.8.8.8), and if its unreachable, change its default gw to 172.30.0.4 ? 
 Thanks for any tips.

                              <span>So our network is typically a 48 port access switch run back to the core stack via 2 network runs, we have a situation where we are expanding one of our locations to have a 2nd 48 port switch. would it make more sense to break up the bonded run, and do single runs to each switch or leave it and trunk the vlans through one acces switch to the next. I feel it really does not matter all that much but I was just checking what people typically do here.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m looking for a good tiny vpn device. I have a paloalto fw for the main site and a few fortinets for some of the sites with 15+ users. Now I&#x27;ve got 3 or 4 sites where their will only be 1 device. To send data in over vpn, no internet access otherwise, ideally able to do aes256bit encryption.. ikev2/ipsec.. but be able to handle a more secure connection if needed. Like 512bit.. Only need to cat 5 ports one for the internet and one for the pc.
 And as an fyi theirs a space contraint, ideally the size of a micropc, and under $600.

                              <span>Hey all!
 A problem i cant wrap my head around arose. How can i just receive a signal from a CWDM4 transceiver?
 I have one pair that&#x27;s linked between two routers, i&#x27;ve put an tap/splitter into the the lines, but i need to receive this signal. When hooking it up to the rx port of another CWDM4 transceiver all i get is a sad day :(
 ​
 Edit: Just to clarify i have the tx from each of the transceivers tapped, and im trying to input this into the rx of another cwdm4 to see what i am receiving. The problem is that i&#x27;m not getting anything from the transceiver even though i have great signal strength.
 ​
 Any tips for me?
 Eternal gratitude will be given to those who can help me.
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Hi guys! 
 I am currently working on implementing my own Fail2Ban for windows. I haven&#x27;t been able to find where I can find the failed login logs for OpenSSH. 
 When I tried to use the Event Viewer I had no success, because it only shows that there was an &quot;Audit Failure&quot; but not the Source Network Address. 
 Does anyone know how to get the failed login attempts for OpenSSH on Windows?

                              <span>I’ve been looking at Juniper SRX 300 series but it only seems to support LTE mini-PIM and the docsis module is no longer supported. 
 Is there anything I’m missing?
 I’d like to setup a juniper, Cisco, hell even a Palo Alto with built in 5G backup instead of LTE. Does this exist yet? This is for a work from home deployment. I’ve found consumer grade routers that support this but I’d prefer to go pro. Ideally I’d like a docsis 3 module and 5G backup, but the 5G is most important.

                              <span>Looks like the ASR1001X has been replaced by the C8500 series. 
 I&#x27;m just looking at the Cisco build tool and as usual I&#x27;m confused by it. 
 I know you have to order the DNA licensing but don&#x27;t have to renew it but what I can&#x27;t see is if you don&#x27;t renew are you then on a reduced bandwidth? 
 I need the C8500-8S4X to have 10Gb available throughput and looking at the license options it has the below: 
 DNA-P-T3-A-3Y &#x3D; Cisco DNA Advantage On-Prem Lic 3Y - upto 10G (Aggr, 20G) 
 If I get this and it expires after 3 years will it then reduce the router down to it&#x27;s base throughput whatever that may be? 
 Or am I looking at this wrong and the C8500 series isn&#x27;t license locked anyway?

 In my head the OSI model is the ideal way.. the &quot;model&quot; used for systems communicate with each other.
 A basic set of protocols used when transferring data. 
 I feel like I am not grasping it very well. Am I right or wrong?

 why i need set route-redistribution with distribute a route received ebgp to announce to ebgp?
 bgp dont work in default mode (ebgp -&gt; ebgp) (ibgp -&gt; ebgp) (ebgp -&gt; ibgp) without filter ?
 Its working just with this conf on checkpoint fw...

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try and keep this brief.
 We have a new 1GB DIA circuit from Zayo in the datacenter we&#x27;re colocating in. The datacenter tech ran a SMF jumper from the Zayo handoff to our cabinet where for the time being I have it going to a 1.25GB SPF module in an EdgeRouter X SFP.
 That&#x27;s it. Simple and sweet, but I&#x27;m only getting aprx 150-180Mb down, 300-400Mb up speeds. That&#x27;s testing from every major speed test website, as well as running Iperf to the public 10Gb servers. Also tried testing directly from the router itself using Ubiquiti&#x27;s speed test built in UISP. Same every time.
 I tried both setting the router up as a L3 gateway, and as a L2 switch. Same results.
 Naturally Zayo refuses to even consider the problem may be on their end.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Has anyone been able to recover users that were deleted beyond the normal scope of 20 days plus? I had users that were accidentally deleted back in March and I am desperate to try and restore what we had worked on that was owned by these users. 
 ​
 Anyone have any contacts with Google or know if there&#x27;s a possible way to recover, not getting too far with live chat and i was in the hospital during the suspensions/deletions and didn&#x27;t know about this.. 
 ​
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been with the same company for 16 years. 17 in July. We&#x27;ve had some rough times of course. 2023 is going to be stupid though. We&#x27;ve been warned. No raises. OK. It&#x27;s only been 2% for several years anyway. So not great. My reviews are exceeds to all of you managers. So I&#x27;m not just disgruntled. I&#x27;m pretty good at what I do. So what else is going to suck? We have to do after-hours support every three weeks for a full week. They are not going to pay us though. We have to volunteer. Now, in IT we&#x27;ve all canceled family vacations and lost money on plane tickets, yada yada.. It&#x27;s not just happening to me personally, it&#x27;s my team. My direct manager is great, and so is my IT director. They are very good human beings. I can&#x27;t stress that enough. Mr. Rogers&#x27;s territory nice. &quot;Good people&quot; if you&#x27;re from the American Midwest. You know what that term means.
 I got a Teams call today from HR. I had used the F word in an email to my wife on 19 Dec 2023 at 0759 EST. I have a company phone and I had used a company phone to say the F-word in an email. OK fine. I violated company policy. I will endeavor to be mindful in the future when using my mobile phone, not to say the F-word or any other word that people find offensive. That list gets updated yearly. 
 I said to the HR rep &quot; you called to chew me out about email usage, but a multi-billion dollar company is refusing to pay the IT department overtime when we actually work overtime? Can you see why I might be upset? You are not solving problems, you&#x27;re just making problems up. You never just say thank you to us&quot;. The HR rep said, &quot;Well, I guess you&#x27;re thanked with a paycheck&quot;. 
 For the first time in 16.5 years, I started updating my resume. I can&#x27;t continue to &quot;volunteer&quot;.

                              <span>Hi fellow redditors,
 About 11 months ago i started my first job in IT with a team of 3 other employees, within 6 months they all left the company and i was left alone with the basic knowledge of the infrastructure.. only a small amount was documentated.
 Everyone in the office expects me to know every system because they think i know everything.
 My contract is almost ending and i have a job interview tomorrow morning, but i have no clue how to tell my current employee i want to leave, since when im gone there is basically noone for IT..
 Could anyone give some advice on how to handle this or has been in the same situation?
 Thanks alot, ive learned alot from you guys!

                              <span>Sorry if this was posted already. Just got this e-mail from Rapid7:
 Beginning December 20, 2022, Rapid7 has responded to an increase in the number of Microsoft Exchange server compromises. The attacks appear to chain CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 together to bypass previously recommended URL rewrite mitigations that Microsoft provided for ProxyNotShell. Threat actors are using this to deploy ransomware. 
 Rapid7 recommends that organizations who have yet to install the Exchange update (KB5019758) from November 2022 should do so immediately and investigate systems for indicators of compromise. Do not rely on the rewrite mitigations for protection. 
 Customers already have coverage to assist in assessing exposure to and detecting exploitation of this threat: 
 ​
  
InsightVM and Nexpose: InsightVM and Nexpose added checks for CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 on November 8, 2022.
 InsightIDR: InsightIDR customers can look for the alerting of 8 rules listed in our blog post.

                              <span>So this morning I was alerted by some users to a suspicious email. I figured it was yet another phish that made it through filters. But no.
 A worker for a state agency seeking child support from someone who MIGHT work/have worked for us was reaching out. Legitimate email. Now, did they send this to HR? Some high profile person in the company? No. Somehow they managed to figure out three of our internal distribution lists (likely more, but only those three accept email from outside the domain) and sent a blast out to all of them.
 This is already in &quot;Oh hell no&quot; territory. But it was worse. There was an attachment as well as the person&#x27;s name. And the attachment, an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT, had the Name, Address, Family Members, and SSN of said person they were looking for. Sent to a distribution list with hundreds of recipients.
 HR notified, and well... I&#x27;d been putting off on learning how to mass delete things via Exchange powershell. Email is gone except for what&#x27;s been saved as evidence, but that information was still accessible for several hours. To hundreds of people.
 In HR&#x27;s hands now, and I really hope that state worker gets more than a slap on the wrist.
 Bless all of you who put tutorials online.

                              <span>We recently rolled out a new piece of software and it is tied in with Microsoft identity which requires staff to use the Microsoft authenticator and push MFA method to sign in. We&#x27;ve had some push back from staff regarding the installation of the Microsoft Authenticator as they feel that the Microsoft Authenticator app will spy on them or provide IT staff with access to their personal information. 
 I&#x27;m looking for some examples of how you dealt with and resolved similar situations in your own organizations.

                              <span>We had basically no spam filtering when I inherited my new role managing a company and their email was just a firestorm of spam and garbage.
 I enrolled the domain in a new spam filtering service (Antespam) which I&#x27;ve used many times in the past and love it and it offers users the ability to whitelist/manage their own spam and have great customer support.
 Not 3 days in and I&#x27;m already getting all kinds of push back from people whining that they don&#x27;t want to have to babysit their email.
 I&#x27;ve tried telling them that checking the sidelined emails every day or at the beginning and end of each day here initially will give them the chance to add senders to their whitelist and as a result, legitimate emails getting sidelined will occur less frequently.
 &quot;Thanks, I hate it.&quot;
 I implemented the filtering on Friday night and it&#x27;s blocked 9 viruses, one spear phishing attempt and 91% of inbound mail was spam.
 The users heavily impacted by spam in the past are singing praises from the mountaintops (some would get anywhere from 50 to 100 spam mails per day) but those who got relatively no spam are up in arms that they didn&#x27;t need it, want to opt out (you can&#x27;t) and are seemingly trying to convince management that we don&#x27;t need this.
 The CEO is on my side, agrees that it&#x27;s best for our network safety and approved the move to the service. I am just trying to craft that diplomatic message to the nay sayers who maybe weren&#x27;t really affected by spam before but now are having legit emails get put on the sideline and causing them to have to routinely go and check for mail sitting in the filter.

                              <span>tldr; We’re the (now) three guys who built imUp -- the app that measures internet speeds and performance. Our first post in r/sysadmin received a ton of awesome feedback and suggestions two years ago on how to improve the platform and we’ve worked hard to build every feature that was requested. We’re back to give some insight into our journey since our last post and answer any questions or hear suggestions you may have. There&#x27;s a lot below, but we wrote this with the hope that the sysadmin community would find it interesting to hear the story of a small SaaS startup(?), how we approach enginering, and how we appreciate and act on feed back from the community -- you all.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to use winget to install software on some computers. I can get a normal powershell or cmd scrip to run, like creating a file under a certain filepath.
 But when I&#x27;m trying to use winget, nothing works. I use it in the system environment, at startup, with - -accept-package-agreements and - -accept-source-agreemets options.
 Obviously I&#x27;ve tried running the command by itself and it does work.
 I&#x27;ve tried to get the output of winget - -info to a file and it does not work either.
 Do you guts have any experience with that?

                              <span>Hi! 
 so i am new to this field and landed few months ago this &quot;helpdesk&quot; role but i am kinda a jack of all trades.
 I need to take on some security tasks, one of them is to split all the admin accounts to 2 accounts, 1 account to do admin stuff and 1 &quot;normal&quot; user account. (so for example, the IT personel now only uses 1 account for everything like normal desktop and mail work and also admin work). we want to split these into 2.
 I thought the best way to do this is to take a copy of the existing admin accounts and demote the existing admin account to an user account and the copy is the new admin account to do admin stuff. 
 Does any of you guys has experience with this? i am a bit stressed to operate this project. Any help is welcome.
 We are on a hybrid Microsoft environment.

We checked permissions, audio, disabled and re-enabled drivers, gpupdate, uninstall and reinstall application. used alternative input devices. Remove MS teams, deleted Teams %AppData% folder and restarted. One trick, we remove the .esc.data file – restart). I know of one trigger (quit MS Teams) allows us to use it briefly. This is on a Dell XPS Laptop. Any help would be great.

                              <span>Hi all, is it strange to be working as a sysadmin. migrating companies on premise to cloud, configuring vms routers etc. But when a user asks me how to calculate and combine this with that etc in excel I just can&#x27;t help them. They know more then me..
 Also I just hate excel and have no interest in knowing this program.

 I will break this down into 2 sections; 1 for the technical aspect and the other on the aspect of how i can approach my management team with this idea.
 Technical Aspect
 Essentially, what this application would do is to automate some repetitive task that are done on Unix servers.
 The reason why i am doing this in C# is because, the users doing these task are using Windows laptops. The users being my company&#x27;s customers. And they have been using tools such as putty/Moboxtreme to accomplish this task which is merely typing out unix commands on different machine 1 by 1. All the commands are the same, some commands deviates a little based on the purpose of the se…</span>

                              <span>I upgraded a Windows 11 Home (Samsung Galaxy Book2) to Windows 11 Pro and have been having issues with it. For starters when I try to enable the wedget for the weather it tells me I need to log into my MS account, same goes for when I want to setup the Windows Hello.
 I have normal Windows 11 Pro machines at the office and I never have to log into MS to setup the wedget, as for the Windows Hello I haven&#x27;t experienced it yet as the owners don&#x27;t believe in laptops. LOL So this one is our first. 
 So I wonder if I should do a reinstall of Windows 11, but I am not sure how its going to work if I need to retype the KEY once its loaded to get back into Professional, at which point I might be just chasing my tail!? :(

                              <span>Working on replacing domain controllers and found something I never seen before. Maybe somebody over here can help me out on this.
 Let&#x27;s say my domain is domain.local and my domain controllers are DC-OLD and DC-NEW. I have promoted DC-NEW to be a Domain Controller and Demoted DC-OLD. When I look in my DNS I find:
 1) zone _msdcs.domain.local, this zone contains all records I expect, SRV records / _gc records / _ldap records etc.
 2) zone domain.local, this zone contains all servers / computers / etc.
 3) subzone, _msdcs under number 2. This is a DNS Delegate if I am right (grey icon). In this subzone I only find a NS record pointing to DC-OLD
 The NS record under 3 is not updated by the DC promotion and demotion (number 1 is updated correctly). Feels like it is not actively used in my situation, if I do a lookup to _msdcs.domain.local it will answer with information found in number 1. I think this is some sort of pointer solution used in ealier versions of Windows AD.
 What is the right thing to do? I can think of 2 scenario&#x27;s:
 a) Replace the NS record of DC-OLD with DC-NEW
 b) Do not give it any attention, let it just like this
 I think scenario a is the best option. Is this correct and does it have any impact on my AD / DNS if I take this action?

 I have a shared mailbox for example [HR@myorg.com](mailto:HR@org.com). When external senders receive a mail from [HR@myorg.com](mailto:HR@myorg.com) it can be confusing so i would like to change the display name so that they see the display name as something like &quot;CompanyName[HR@myorg.com](mailto:HR@myorg.com)&quot; without changing the actual email address.
 Is this possible?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a bit of a head scratcher, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get around it at the moment.
 I have configured an M2 based Macbook for a remote user, and part of that is installing the DUO client. Whilst setting it up, everything worked well and Duo sent a push notification to approve the login.
 Now the user has it, the laptop is obviously not configured for their home wifi, so Duo complains that it can&#x27;t do anything as it has no network connection. Putting the user in bypass mode makes no difference, as the client still can&#x27;t connect to the Duo servers...
 Apple in their infinite wisdom doesn&#x27;t allow you to connect to a wifi network from the login screen. Using the Option key to boot up and connect to a wifi network doesn&#x27;t pass the connection through to the login screen either.
 I have sent the user a USB-C to LAN adapter which said it was plug and play on Macs, and although it works on their personal Dell laptop, it doesn&#x27;t work on their company issued Mac. I don&#x27;t know if this is because it doesn&#x27;t work on M2 devices, or if the Mac needs to silently install something when it&#x27;s connected, but because the laptop isn&#x27;t logged in, it&#x27;s not able to.
 I&#x27;ve ordered another adapter for the user which claims compatibility with M2 Macs, so I&#x27;m crossing fingers for that.
 The user is 2 1/2 hours drive away, so a visit is not really practical.
 Does anyone have any ideas on how I can best get this user up and running?

 is there any way to tell remote machine is virtual machine or physical machine, I have 100 machines, i want to know which are virtual which are physical.
 ​
 Also , We don&#x27;t have any hostname for remote environment. Just We have VLAN Address informations.

                              <span>Problem: People are missing non-junk emails because they end up in the junk folder. Especially if they are auto-forwards from another domain.
 Ideally, we want nothing to go into the junk folder (unless on the block senders list). So everything goes to the inbox, notwithstanding malware and phishing. With everything going to Inbox, it would also be nice to get some indicator of junkiness as a MailTip on the message, but we&#x27;d settle for pre-pending the subject.
 Have a ticket open with Microsoft, and here&#x27;s what we tried:
  
Change the anti-spam policy. Any actions that say &#x27;send to junk folder&#x27; have been changed to prepend the subject with &#x27;Possible spam&#x27;.
  
This doesn&#x27;t really work. Yes, the subject is changed. But the email still ends up in the Junk folder. Maybe Outlook is doing this by examining the SCL. But there&#x27;s also no way to turn off the junk filter in Outlook. Just in case, I checked the blocked domains/emails list, and it is empty.
  
Set up a transport rule to change all inbound mail to SCL -1. 
  
This works, but I don&#x27;t like it because a) it doesn&#x27;t prepend the subject, and b) it alters the SCL artificially, so by the time you get the message, you don&#x27;t know what the original SCL was.
  
Adjust the rule to prepend a subject. Ended up pre-pending everything. So we adjusted the rule to only apply to inbound mail where the SCL was above 4. But then the rule seemed never to get applied.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll admit my note taking isn&#x27;t the best, they&#x27;re often an explosion of nuggets of information scattered around in various formats. OneNote has been my main tool for note taking, but it&#x27;s getting too messy. I ALWAYS think &quot;ehhh.. I&#x27;ll remember this&quot; and then in 4-months when somebody asks me about X ticket it&#x27;s always a mission to get everything together again.
 Do you guys have a tool, more like a database which is good for note storing? Something where you can reference a ticket number or project name and link all the notes you took relating to it.
 THanks!

                              <span>Posting this here as a hail mary since I haven&#x27;t had much success elsewhere yet.
 Recently, our organization updated from ActivClient 7.1.x.x to 7.4.1.5 and started seeing some inconsistent results with our smart card functionality. Previously, we didn&#x27;t really have any issues, except some few instances we we began rolling out O365 (that requires PIV auth) over the summer. In our VDI infrastructure, we had more issues with O365 and were told to update our ActivClient by our parent org. We ran into a host of more issues, but now that we updated a small batch of physical workstations and see some similar behavior, it is helping us zero in on the ActivClient 7.4.1.5 version specifically.
 What we&#x27;re seeing: mostly smart card failing to read the certificate, but error messages vary. For my own…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys
 I know this sounds unbelievable but whenever I try to run a non-powershell command in PowerShell in a GNU screen session, the terminal is getting stuck.
 I am able to reproduce this on my Ubuntu 20.04 server:
  
Open up a screen session by invoking screen
 Run a non-powershell command in PowerShell: pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot;
  
This error occurs both when starting a screen session on my host, connect to my server via ssh and run pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot; and when first connecting to my server, starting a screen session on my server and running pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot;.
 My current workaround is to instead run pwsh -c &quot;{ commands }&quot; | cat.
 Running pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot; in a screen session on my host (i.e. without ever connecting to my server via ssh) works.
 Does this sound familiar to you? I&#x27;m very confused - it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.

                              <span>Hey all, 
 We have an small on-prem AD with 10 servers and 35-40 clients. Users are warehouse users working at packing stations on kiosks and the servers are controlling warehouse stuff + microsoft infra servers. 
 Now the wsus have stopped working. 
 ​
 Thinking with only 35-40 clients (servers are managed by Azure Update Automation which is not supported for Windows 10), wouldn&#x27;t it be easier with updating against WU directly? 
 Bandwidth is not a problem. But we want maybe be able to do half of the workstations at the time if we get an bad update. 
 Whats your take? 
 Thanks

                              <span>I was configuring CA policies as a global admin and may have locked myself out. 
 I have hardware toke,password and authenticator for the account. I can sign in using one of the two(for admin)but it shows Verify your identity. My understanding is that additional verification is set to have 2 methods, verify using email and authenticator. 
 I was testing out authentication strength and enabled the highest one with hardware token or windows hello or business or Certificate for admins. I do have authenticator and if the prompt shows up(when I sign in to non admin stuff) it gets stuck on verify your identity because authentication strength for users was also enabled to passwordless. I do have that but I am not excluded from the policies. 
 I have already contacted Microsoft and they have arranged a call back but I was wondering if there is any solution. No glass break account available. If I click cancel, it shows account as signed in but. It goes to verify your identity when I click on it.

                              <span>Hey Folks,
 I think MI Support is playing me here.
 We are currently running Core 11.5 and we usually use a policy to restrict iOS devices not up to date to connect to our Infra.
 Our current config is set to quarantine anything before iOS 16.1. With the arrival of 16.2 we wanted to update said config to 16.2 but it is not listed there.
 ​
 Mobile iRon is not telling me to update Core because only EPMM 11.8 will support iOS 16.2.
 They are sending me a bunch of kbase about Compatibility and according to said kBase even Core 11.7 would be not compatible with anything above iOS 15.5.
 ​
 Am i the only one having such problem with Ivanti/Mobile iRon ? 
 ​
 ( We could upgrade, but given the poor support, i&#x27;m not sure this would fix it. 
 We are on freeze due to year end, so that would anyway require a thousand approvals from the business.
 yes i have done the Device and Platform update manually ).

 Do you have recommendations for a viable robust alternative?

Various devices inside the dock will randomly not be passed to Windows (eg: ethernet, 2nd display (daisy chained)). Sometimes both displays show nothing but peripherals like keyboard and mouse work. Unplugging the USB-C cable and plugging in 3 to 20 times seems to resolve it until next time.
 
Slow detection/starting up of monitor/dock once USB-C cable is connected. Users say they &quot;often&quot; see it take a minute for the screens to display anything.
 
Arcing / crackling sound when the monitor is in standby and no laptop is connected. Power cycling stops the noise temporarily.
 
Microphone quality / audio issues during Teams meetings. I&#x27;m aware of the &quot;double noise cancellation&quot; issue that occurs when Teams is trying to reduce background noise and the monitor&#x27;s microphone is trying to do the same, but come on, these are supposedly &quot;Teams certified&quot; devices. How is this conflict expected behaviour?

                              <span>Hello, we have a problem within the whole department. Earlier this month I made a post where we had office 2010, outlook and excel issues. Boss allocated few licenses for 2016 and we still have issues - certain files won&#x27;t open and network usage sharply increasing during opening that certain file, although, mail text is empty sometimes, some has crashed when setting up signatures.
 Switched from 2010x86 to 2016x64, clean install. Additionaly installed SAP and Oracle SmartView and updates. We were also trying to open a file without sap and sv, no change.
 That accounting department won&#x27;t pay us for that switch lol. The funny thing is that this issue is only on new laptops company bought. Both new laptop and old pc has same os, same updates and same software with add-Ins, but laptop won&#x27;t open docs that pc can.
 Reinstalling windows would be a nice idea tho. Still, this case has 33% chance after reinstalling windows.

                              <span>I know we all have better things to do so I&#x27;ll try to make this quick and easy.
 Trying to transfer a domain name from GoDaddy to Bluehost. Reason being marketing created a new self managed website on Bluehost. 
 If I transfer the domain to Bluehost. I know I&#x27;ll need to create the DNS entries first to match....... But should I be concerned about downtime or services breaking? 
 I&#x27;m not a DNS expert by any means. In fact I inherited the responsibility. But there&#x27;s a lot of looks like garbage in there probably from previous me&#x27;s and you&#x27;s that said maybe this will work. My concern here is I see a lot of ms365 stuff. We have a hybrid solution but I don&#x27;t know if transferring will break things.
 Any help will be appreciated. Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to put in a ticket l!!!!!!

                              <span>I recently moved to San Antonio to get closer to a family member. I had a fully remote job but decided it&#x27;s time to change jobs. I was able to land a decent paying job 20% salary increase with great learning opportunities. Since I am new to the city I didn&#x27;t bother to check traffic/commute when I accepted the job. It&#x27;s about 25 miles away but the traffic is so horrible my average daily commute is 1hr10min each way. That&#x27;s 40hr+ a month sitting in traffic. During holidays my commute is 25-30 min and any bit of rain makes it 1hr30min+. What&#x27;s even more sad is traffic doesn&#x27;t die down until 8-9pm. I HATE SAN ANTONIO. /rantover
 How bad is your commute?

 Also, do you know if anyone has published a capability maturity model for Patch Management?
 Any suggestions/links, etc. would be appreciated!
 e.g
 - All Machines C disk status control
 - App Owner notification after patching
 so on

                              <span>I am having issues with a radius server behind a site to site VPN.
 I have a Synology NAS using the Radius Server setup. Local clients can use the WPA Enterprise locally.
 This is behind a Dream Machine Pro SE.
 I have a site to site VPN setup
 I have a UDM that is connected site to site to the UDM Pro SE.
 Clients on the UDM using the site to site VPN are not able to use the WPA Enterprise. When I did Wireshark it shows the source IP is the WAN address to the local address. Is there something that needs to be changed on the Unify devices because it is not showing anything on the Radius server as trying to auth.

                              <span>I recently had a disagreement with my CIO over compensation for an assistant net admin vs an assistant sysadmin. I told him they should be paid the same if they had the same experience, etc; he said that sysadmins are worth more. I was flabbergasted. As the senior netadmin, I’m compensated the same as the senior sysadmin. Is this a common thing in IT, across industries that sysadmins are worth more than netadmins, or am I right in demanding they be equal?

                              <span>At one of our branch sites, for the past few days, users have been complaining about network connectivity being lost or crawling while attempting to access certain websites. During the time they say the issues are happening, no maintenance, or backups are occurring. Something tells me to check the routes on the customer edge router at the site and I see that all of iBGP learned routes are recently learned. Flapping has crossed my mind so I check the logs, and around the same time users “lose”connectivity to the sites, one can see BFD adjacencies going down between the CE spoke and a WAN reflector we have in another location. 
 Interestingly enough, the websites users are attempting to access are not suppose to be learned via iBGP. They are externally redistributed in EIGRP. During the issue, when checking the time of the EIGRP routes, they are days old. So how could users not have access to the sites? When you run a trace to the website during the issue, it makes it there. When you check the ISP vrf, the route to the PE is still there. No circuit issues are seen. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Does anyone have a link or recommendation for some basic UCCX training? Typical story – one guy managed it then he dropped the smoke and left with no passdown… now it’s mine. 
 The thing I need to figure out quick, and if anyone could point me in the right direction I would appreciative… how do I go about changing the initial greeting to a temporary holiday greeting? My management said it’s all pre-recorded and that all I have to do is “flip the switch” on Christmas eve morning… I have located those pre-recordings but I’m lost in the sauce on how to apply them. Literally any guidance, article, video, etc would be helpful. 
 I only have 2 days to figure it out... thanks everyone.

                              <span>Hello dear colleagues, 
 I have a question in regard to setting up some filters on Juniper EX switches and I hope you can help me out with a sanity check and ideas on how to make my configuration better. Or if I am on the wrong path - set me towards the correct one.
 For the sake of this question, let&#x27;s assume the following very simple topology:
 ​
 Juniper MX Edge ----&gt; Juniper QFX Core ---&gt; Juniper EX top-of-rack ---&gt; Host1, Host2, Host3, HostX
 ​
 Each VLAN is up on the QFX Core and the EX TOR switches act as simple Layer2 devices only. Ideally, we want to keep this configuration like that and not bring VLANs up on the EX switches - only ACLs.
 ​
 Currently, each of the hosts connected to the TOR switches (in our case - dedicated server services) are in their own VLAN with a /30 of IPv4…</span>

 I have an HCI cluster connected to two disparate switches. The NICs on the cluster are set to active-backup, so if the active fails for whatever reason it is supposed to switch to the backup.
 The two switches are directly connected via LAG/Trunk (LACP). The two switches are also connected to the core for user traffic.
 I&#x27;m trying to avoid potential issues with spanning-tree topology changes causing all of the ports to go into listening mode for 30 seconds, and crashing the whole cluster. I have implemented portfast/admin-edge on all ports connecting to the HCI, but I also want to enable it on the Trunk/LAG.
 I&#x27;ve been taught to never implement portfast on uplinks to other switches, so I&#x27;m afraid to pull the trigger on that last part. But I would think that the core uplink from the secondary would always be in a blocking state unless the primary core uplink goes down. Does that sound right? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all,
 Recently I was connecting 2 floors together with the exact same Cisco 9300s, running near the same SW Ver (One is running 17.03.04 the other 17.03.05). While connecting these two with SFP+, I put in the EXACT same SFP+ modules, and I couldn&#x27;t get a connection, even though the switches saw them both. Both SFP+ were brand new. After much troubleshooting, I swapped one out with a different one, and viola, I got connection. Now here are the two SFP+ modules, and tell me how this is working, and why the exact two didn&#x27;t. (I&#x27;m new to working with fiber, so please bear with me) 
 Floor 3: SFP-10G-BX ; 1330nm ; LC Connection
 Floor 2: SFP-10G-BX80 ; 1270nm ; LC Connection 
 I thought the wavelengths HAD to be the same on both ends? What&#x27;s the deal? Also, this is a single wire, yellow cable, (SFP&#x27;s are single too) which I believe to be single mode. Any insight would be appreciated!

                              <span>Looking for a Netflow Analyzer solution. Currently using PRTG as a Netflow collector. It does the job, but leaves a lot to be desired and does not have the ability to overlay security analysis, threat reporting, and IP reputations, etc. I was really excited to try Elastiflow, but without a DevOps team and no knowledge of the ELK stack the learning curve us far too steep.
 Any recommendations for Elastiflow-like Netflow Analysis solutions?

                              <span>Cisco is proposing a Nexus 9k environment backed by Nexus Dashboard to upgrade our horribly EOL 6509s. We originally were going to 7706s and then they EOLd those as well. My original plan to use VDCs on the 7706s appears to be dead.
 I&#x27;m pretty unfamiliar with ACI/Dashboard, but they&#x27;re pushing this because I wanted to use VDCs, and they&#x27;re saying I can do the same thing but with &#x27;slices&#x27;. 
 Additionally I can see us using VXLANs as well.
 WTF am I getting myself into? Managing Nexus at the cli is no problem for me, but selling my soul to a dashboard (one from Cisco at that) is something I&#x27;m wary about.
 Should I bail?
 Thanks.

                              <span>What I&#x27;m looking for might not exist, but I&#x27;m hoping /r/networking will have some recommendations for me.
 I&#x27;m looking for the smallest footprint network monitoring and alerting software available. I need to install it in *NIX. All I need is icmp/TCP checks on around 20 remote devices, and then email alerts if those aren&#x27;t responding after a certain amount of time.
 I don&#x27;t need a web interface, or graphing, or historical data. I&#x27;d even prefer to avoid installing mysql or any DB if possible.
 Does anything like this exist? I&#x27;ve used LibreNMS/Zabbix/icinga2/etc in the past and they are fantastic, but they are overkill for the needs I have on my current project.
 Maybe my best option is to throw together a crude bash script?
 Thanks in advance for any ideas you can send my way!

                              <span>Hi Everyone - my company currently uses a &quot;Traditional&quot; client vpn solution and we are focusing on Prisma Access and Zscaler as a replacement. I like the idea of the service connections for Prisma, the connectors that run on a VM/container for Zscaler was unexpected, but I do like what they are capabale of doing.
 We are heavy on all workstation OSs - windows, macos and linux. 
 Also, the environment consists of public/private clouds.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m writing this post to get some advice regarding a problem that is affecting the network of the company I work for.
 Our infrastructure consists of L2 devices (switches, radios etc) within it and is &quot;delimited&quot; by many L3 routers which are the edges of our unic large broadcast domain. Obviously there are several VLANs within it, but we have to propagate them over the backbone links, preventing us from segmenting the network.
 The problem is the following: every time we put a new PC on the network, it starts a NetBIOS boradcast storm that propagates to all our switches, causing us many problems. We have intercepted the packet with WireShark and we are certain that this is the problem, what we don&#x27;t understand is why the packet continues to run even after disconnecting the offending PC. We have already taken steps to put in the broacast limits (storm constrain etc) but we would prefer to solve the problem at the source.
 Has anyone ever had a similar problem? Is there any way to prevent the storm, apart from disabling NetBIOS? Could this be due to a malware installed on one of our networked devices?
 Thanks to all those who will respond!

 We have them in several locations and I&#x27;ve recently taken the role as primary maintainer. What I&#x27;ve found is that they seem to be very buggy. They come with a process that will initiate a reboot when internet connectivity is lost but once in a while, they don&#x27;t fully recover from the reboot. power cycling to reboot again doesn&#x27;t work. 
 We also see an issue where the admin interface ssh daemon fails and you can&#x27;t log in that way. webui still works. 
 Their support is... lacking to say the least.
 Their firmware path is questionable. 
 Multiple power cycling doesn&#x27;t appear to help, only consoling in and rebooting that way allows it to properly shut down and restart.
 So it almost seems like our out of band management system needs an out of band management system.
 Anyone else have experience with Perle and maybe some hints?

                              <span>5 years ago I started my first IT job as a helpdesk technician. I was 21, living with my parents and sleeping on the couch in the living room in a 1 bed 1 bath apartment wondering how the hell am I going to get out of the hood. I am now 26, earning $125,000/year as a security engineer. Here&#x27;s how I did it, and more life update details:

I deleted the AD accounts to clean it up but didn&#x27;t realize our hybrid on-premise sync would delete their M365 account and email as well.
  
 I noticed what I&#x27;ve done 3 hours later and immediately restored their deleted accounts in the Exchange &quot;deleted users&quot; recycle bin. I noticed it forced me to create a new temporarily password, which I notified them of. Is there anything else I need to do to make sure their mailbox is restored back to normal with their old emails?

This effectively mandates MDM for all salaried employees with no way to opt-out, as they are generally required to have company resources installed on their personally owned mobile phones.

 Do any of you have experience with setups like this, or have any recommendations?

                              <span>So I am looking into start of authority and am curious about something.
 We have 5 Domain Controllers, 2 of which are having replication issues. DC1 is one with replication issues and also so happens to be the SOA for all DNS zones on all of the DCs.
 DC2 is a direct mirror of DC1, with the exception of ADFS, and so I thought &quot;what if we made DC2 SOA for all the DNS zones across all DCs&quot;
 If this change were to be made, what potential issues would you expect I run into?
 The reason this thought exists is due to replication being down on 2 DCs, we want to demote and repromote without DNS giving us an error, especially since we already tried this and we found out that it was due to SOA.
 Any insight into this or helpful suggestions, would be appreciated.
 **additional info*\*
 there is a bit of background missing here, most of which I do not have since I have only been in this position for 5 months.
 From what I can put together from various conversations the prior sys admins made undocumented changes to the DCs, which ive been working to understand,. its slow going.
 The issue we have is 4 of the 5 DCs have the same DNS forward/reverse zones and the 5th is minus a few the other 4 have.
 The replication issue came on roughly 2 months ago and only hit DC1 and DC5 with an error that states &quot;sysvol inaccessible&quot;
 We tried to demote DC1 and repromote it, but when we did we got an error stating the DNS server was not present even though the role existed. 
 One of our contractors helped look into this and determined it could possibly be a start of authority issue.
 I have never had to actually do this before in all my time in IT, so this is very much uncharted waters for me.

 Thank you

 Instead of outsourcing cheap labor we should outsource the most expensive parts of our companies. I truly think ChatGPT is up to the task.
 Edit: No I do not want my ChatGPT to play gold 3 times a week and sexual harass the executive assistants.

 I have a few servers with a conglomerate of control panels and want to test something else to see what&#x27;s out there.
 I stumbled on VestaCP, but that project seems dead, Hestia Control Panel seems to be the fork of that, and has code commits on github as recently as two days ago.
 Anyone here able to give me an unbiased elevator-pitch like opinion on it? I have a server with openisp but postfix on it keeps giving me the odd grey hair, and it is overly complex to maintain IMO.
 Feedback will be massively appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience here before I jump down this rabbit hole.
 I&#x27;m in a ~80 user environment that has on-prem AD (probably not going away) that&#x27;s using ADConnect to sync users to the cloud and O365/Exchange Online (for many years). Exchange has never been installed in this environment, so there are no Exchange attributes in AD.
 I have a few items I&#x27;d like to tackle (mostly cleaning up the GAL (hiding on prem DLs, hiding certain users), ability to add additional addresses to users) that seem they would be easier if I had the Exchange Attributes in AD. My understanding is I can just run 
 XX:\Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /PrepareSchema 
 and that will give me the attributes I need, not install Exchange and I can do basic management from ADSI. I know I&#x27;ll need to refresh the schema in ADConnect, and I know that for &quot;msExchHideFromAddressLists&quot; to populate, &quot;mailNickname&quot; needs to be populated an unique.
 Here are a few questions I&#x27;ve come up with
  
Will this overwrite anything in the cloud and &#x27;break&#x27; existing mailboxes (stuff like legacyExchangeDN or X500 addresses)
 Should I continue with the installation of Exchange server for management purposes? If I go this route, do I need to set up Hybrid Mode? Or is &#x27;just installing&#x27; Exchange enough?
 Am I muddling my environment by adding Exchange? Should I instead take alternate routes to accomplish these goals? (like use msDS-CloudExtensionAttribute custom sync rules) For what it&#x27;s worth, if I installed Exchange, my plan would be to have it on a server that&#x27;s only booted when doing management tasks, but otherwise not powered on.
  
I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has gone down this path before, and curious what you&#x27;ve seen... most of my worry is in overwriting something that was custom set on the cloud for a sync&#x27;d user, though I know most parameters must be sync&#x27;d from on-prem.

                              <span>Greetings,
 ​
 I am trying to write a batch file that goes through a text file and for each line of the text file runs psexec net user command.
 ​
 So far I have the following
 ​
 @echo off setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion :: Reset file Type Nul &gt;&quot;C:\outputfile.txt&quot; for /F &quot;delims&#x3D;&quot; %%a in (C:\ip_addresses) do ( set Var1&#x3D;\\%%a psexec.exe VAR1 net user COMMANDS_HERE &gt;NUL 2&gt;&amp;1 If !errorlevel! equ 0 ( echo %%a Account-Created echo %%a Account-Created&gt;&gt;&quot;C:\create-account.txt&quot; ) Else ( echo %%a Account-NOT-Created echo %%a Account-NOT-Created&gt;&gt;&quot;C:\create-account.txt&quot; ) ) pause 
 ​
 I am definitely getting the second part of the else statement because I can&#x27;t figure out a way to add the &quot;\\&quot; to the %%a placeholder so that psexec executes on the target machine.
 ​
 I know the command I am running with psexec works without an issue as I have tested individually.
 ​
 I have to use this process or manually go and touch about 50+ machines ;-)
 ​
 I appreciate any input.
 ​
 Edit:
 Fixed formatting so my code was in code block format.
 ​
 Edit2:
 Powershell remote administration is not an option...I know, I would much rather use the fantastic tools supplied with Powershell.

                              <span>I have been trying to troubleshoot an issue with a org user not receiving notification emails from our support system. In Mimecast the email bounces with an NDR 5.4.1 Recipient address rejected. At first I thought it was a problem with Mimecast but it seems this is the bounce you get when DBEB is rejecting the email. Now I didn&#x27;t know much about it too be honest until the last few weeks. Microsoft support is useless. They just constantly refer me too their support page explaining DBEB. This user is replicated correctly within O365 from what I see, and our accepted domains are all set to authoritative. Besides that, I am convinced this support system sending these emails (amazonses) has the user on the account level suppression list due to the bounces, but I don&#x27;t have access to this account to verify. Either way DBEB is the first barrier I need to make sure is not rejecting emails to valid addresses. Anyone have any ideas?

                              <span>After talking to an MS support rep, I now know I need a dedicated MS Defender for Office 365 license for every shared mailbox that benefits from the protection.
 However, I got mixed information regarding these shared mailboxes also needing an exchange license (I don&#x27;t need any of the exchange features coming with the license).
 So my question is:
 Do I need an exchange online license and MDO licenses for each shared mailbox? Or is a MDO license enough?
 In case I need an exchange license, what happens if I run it without one?

                              <span>Now that we&#x27;ve rebuilt from the Rackspace disaster I have one more thing to figure out. Our spam filtering on Edgewave/GoSecure. Problem is it doesn&#x27;t seem to work with M365. I&#x27;ve gone in one of our domains and changed the MX, then went into the verifiers and added one for M365 and authorized it with Microsoft but it won&#x27;t test and it won&#x27;t discover mailboxes. Tech support says to use the M365 verifier and RCPTTO for discovery but it doesn&#x27;t work. And the error I&#x27;m getting on every single page of the website is a generic &quot;an error occurred. If this continues contact the administrator&quot; not anything like &quot;failed to discover mailboxes&quot; or &quot;verification failed&quot;. It&#x27;s like a web page error.
 Support has been no help at all. They keep saying the same thing about using the verifier and RCPTTO and that there&#x27;s an issue with the testing. When I explain I&#x27;ve done that they ask another dumb question like &quot;are the mailboxes not being created?&quot; And then don&#x27;t respond again. I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with them up until now but I&#x27;m seeing the Rackspace fiasco all over again.
 Anyone have this working?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Just checking the logon events in the security event log journal on one of my DC and i&#x27;m wondering if this is the expected behaviour that i have this:
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.
 Account Information:
 Account Name: my domain administrator account (administrator@mydomain.whatever) Account Domain: my domain Logon GUID: xxxxxxx 
 Service Information:
 Service Name: a workstation from the domain$ Service ID: domain\\workstation$ 
 ​
 Network Information:
 Client Address: ::1 Client Port: 0 
 ​
 Additional Information:
 Ticket Options: 0x810000 Ticket Encryption Type: 0x12 Failure Code: 0x0 Transited Services: - 
 This event is generated every time access is requested to a resource such as a computer or a Windows service. The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.
 This event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event. The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.
 Ticket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.
 ​
 ​
 Do you guys think it&#x27;s normal to see my administrator account requesting kerberos ticket?
 ​

                              <span>Some consequences when things go wrong:
  
TSB has been fined nearly £49m for an IT meltdown in 2018 that caused chaos and left its customers unable to access online accounts for several weeks.
  
 https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64036529
  
Full report:
  
This situation has all the hallmarks of business management strong-arming the IT organization into an unrealistic timeline. When business leaders push for overly-aggressive timelines, or regulators ask for multiple competing risk frameworks and excessive after-the-fact incident reporting, this all puts a strain on the delivery organization’s ability to untangle the complexity before ‘go live’.

                              <span>The company where I&#x27;m working decided to implement this software for the holy security.
 While I understand the purpose of this software in a &quot;classical company&quot; for regular users I tought it was a really bad decision for us since we are an MSP. 
 90% of our staff are technical, it goes from support team to system/network/addwhatyouwant engineer, developpers etc. We must use admin rights multiple times a day since we have a lot of VPN software requiring it or some specific software for managing old SAN that customers kept even if they&#x27;re 10 years old and so on...
 I tried to convince the director not to install this since it will annoy user and cause problems, I suggested to use dual account policy on the machine: a regular user without rights and another with admin rights (both linked to …</span>

We just got a new email spam firewall service and it’s taken a lot of constant attention to get back where our old service was. So I’m going through the message log and see an email to the Director of IT saying the main domain registration expired! 
 Call and Director of IT. Credit card applied. Swears didn’t get any other notifications - I can see 3 in the email firewall 🙄
 DNS NS record was only down a few hours and seems to be cached most places. 
 Technically I’m a consultant to a former employer (my choice). Just earned my fees for at least this month. 
 And figured out why I couldn’t sleep all night. Now to double check my backups. 
 How have your sysadmin spidey-senses saved the day?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 After 10 years, in march of next year our root vpn cert will expire. I was tasked with renewing the cert(s).
 We have a large volume of connected devices that sometimes can have a downtime of few weeks, so i need to think and implement a solution fast so it can propagate.
 The devices have various hardware and software configurations, from different time periods, so i want to make as minimal changes as possible (e.g. avoid redirecting to a different openvpn instance).
 My google-fu gave me one method - stacked certificates - also explained by hexonet on their blog: https://www.hexonet.net/blog/migrating-new-ca-for-openvpn , it seems that i could simply regenerate the client certs based on the new ca cert and swap them one by one without killing &quot;old&quot; access for not-yet patched cients.
 How would you approach it? There are milions of users so i would prefer to not introduce any significant downtime.

So i would like to install those devices without having to log in. Can i just log in using a local account, install everything and then add a microsoft account? It would auto login to office accounts right?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a VBS Script installed on my Thick client pc&#x27;s to get the information i might need. Now this works completely fine on local windows computers. But when i run it on a thin client or rdp session it (ofcourse) gives me the information of the server.
 Now what i would like to get is the connected server name, Local pc name, logged in user, windows build version of the client pc, and which groups/roles are added to the pc and logged in user.
 My current vbs script is visible here: https://pastebin.com/raw/iqnXY3VF
 I already searched on google but most of the things i could find are for local pc&#x27;s.
 thanks everyone in advance
 edit: I am aware that this might belong in the techsupport reddit but i think the changes to solve this are higher in the sysadmin community

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a problematic that I&#x27;m not sure how to solve easily :
 Previously, we had some Office 16 licences and we used them on some PCs from our fleet. But they weren&#x27;t many and we widely used LibreOffice instead. So when we wanted to install Office on a certain PC, we used a .exe and did a manual install.
 Today, we decided to switch to Office 2019 for all of our users, and with that comes a problem.
 I have to create a GPO which checks if Office 2016 is installed on a computer. If so, it should uninstall it and then install Office 2019 with our key.
 But I also have to make sure the PCs with Office 2007 are excluded from that GPO, since we still use that with some applications that require 2007 specifically.
 Do you think I can do that with only one Powershell script for example ?
 ​
 Thanks,

                              <span>Good morning,
 We&#x27;re running through Cyber Essentials, and one of the passing criteria is to block models that no longer receive security updates from the manufacturer (eg Pixel 3a with Android 10) from accessing cloud resources (authenticating via Azure AD).
 How are people managing similar scenarios, it seems a bit over kill to force users to enforce users to use Edge and enroll into Intune to manage this.
 My thoughts turn to Conditional Access Policy, where for iPhone I could block by iOS version, but that&#x27;s only shows a major version, ie iOS 16, not iOS 16.2. Android is even worse where it seems to just display Android
 Have others had to achieve the above and if so how are they tackling this? Is the only way by enrollment? I&#x27;m using a Microsoft 365 E5 license if that helps suggest options.
 ​
 Thanks in advance,

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m facing an issue that is not easily Googleable and that the SPF RFC seems a bit vague on. Perhaps more experienced folks than I can shed some light?
 Let&#x27;s say I have an SPF record spf.foo.nl and I want to change it to a CNAME pointing to spf.bar.com, which has the exact same content as spf.foo.nl. Would email clients view this as an extra DNS lookup?
 The SPF RFC seems to say that it the limit only counts to the lookups generated inside the record by include and the like, but doesn&#x27;t mention what happens outside the SPF record (for instance in a CNAME record leading to it).
  
Since this is the internet, I know I have to prevent &quot;just do X instead&quot; or &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t do that&quot; by providing a use case:

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have to provide a Virtual Windows 10 Machine for a supplier, from which they can Access certain Servers.
 The Provider has quite high priviledges, which is why i&#x27;d like to Monitor the Desktop, to see what he did when. The Provider accesses the machine via Teamviewer.
 What is the best / cheapest option, to monitor a single client / user. It&#x27;s only a temporary solution, in two months, i dont need the product / license anymore.
 ​
 Thanks for your inputs.

                              <span>What are some career options can I transition into that doesn’t require doing on-calls and late night maintenances?
 I’ve been working as a sysadmin (linux, networking) and then a dev ops engineer (cloud stuff, some python for building tools and automation) for close to 10 years now. Started doing entry level stuff and then “senior” now according to my job title.
 However, one thing that has stayed consistent is that I’m always expected to do on-calls.
 Over the years, on-call has taken its toll on me. I lose weekends that could have been spent on hobbies, or with friends. I have chronic insomnia due to all irregular work hours and late night calls. In short, I constantly feel tired, lonely and mildly depressed.
 Asides from that, I enjoy the job and tinkering with the tech. I don’t think I am ready to leave this industry and do something completely different (like woodworking or something).
 From where I am, what are the possible jobs that I can transition into that doesn’t require on-calls?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I was watching a video on switches that stated a switch can store MAC Addresses in it&#x27;s CAM table after there has been an attempt to communicate from A to B and then a reply from B to A. That would store the MAC addresses of both A and B, but if this is the first time either of these are communicating on the switch I assume it would have to broadcast the entire message from A to B to all ports (similar to a hub) and listen for where the reply comes to map B to it&#x27;s proper port. If that is true could that be a security risk? 
 My other thought is that it would just be one frame (since after first frame it would all be routed directly A to B) so it might not be a huge deal. All of this for the main question of is it possible to have the switch send essentially a &quot;discovery&quot; frame to every port and map the replies so that it wouldn&#x27;t have to send an initial message to all ports. 
 I also think I may be overthinking a relatively miniscule detail but it just caught my attention and was curious. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read and reply!

                              <span>Hi all, have a question about networking and didn&#x27;t know where to go to or what to google so I came here.
 For context, I&#x27;m not a network professional nor an IT expert. I work for a small architectural firm and I&#x27;ve been trying to push for an integrated workflow using open source software platform like NextCloud and OpenProject.
 We&#x27;ve purchased a cheap NAS as a test run to set up a server running docker containers with the abovementioned items. All the apps are routed with SSL through nginx &amp; letsencrypt certificates and I&#x27;ve checked that all internet traffic is forwarded to the server&#x27;s nginx&#x27;s reverse-proxy.
 So things are working, but the problem is that the entire office&#x27;s LAN &amp; Internet speed is capped at 100mbps.
 The LAN routing setup here is a bit messy and unfamiliar to me since …</span>

 I have a script to find the affected groups, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a way to add an addition to the rule or to replace the old job title with a new one.

Currently, they use Jenkins on like 9 different desktop computers. Obviously I want to simplify this and get a server and virtualize this and use containers. Everything else we have is in the cloud (SCM, E-mails, File storage). Or should we just do hosted services online? Does making a build use GPU?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Long story short
  
There is an MBAM server (reporting doesn&#x27;t work tho)
 There is a GPO with Bitlocker settings
 Wanted to move Bitlocker to SCCM 
 Log said on clients that policy did not apply, as the workload for Endpoint Protection was switched ot Pilot Intune (crap)
 Looked at MDM... literally nothing set - just enable bitlocker drive encription
 
  
At this stage keys still get to AD, but it seems that most of the GPO settings won&#x27;t really apply (e.g. 256 bit cipher is set there, but checking on the client with manage-bde the cipher is 128 bit.
 I think literally the MDM setting takes over and it soley turns on bitlocker, but doesn&#x27;t really configure it to our needs.
 I&#x27;d happily move the slider over back to ConfigMgr, but Endpoint Protection has a lot of other stuff, defender firewall and what not...
 The pilot collection is however a huge one. With 95%+ of our clients... bummer.
 I am crying... any ideas?

                              <span>From Ars
  
Researchers recently discovered a Windows code-execution vulnerability that has the potential to rival EternalBlue, the name of a different Windows security flaw used to detonate WannaCry, the ransomware that shut down computer networks across the world in 2017.
 Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required.
 But unlike EternalBlue, which could be exploited when using only the SMB, or server message block, a protocol for file and printer sharing and similar network activities, this latest vulnerability is present in a much broader range of network protocols, giving attackers more flexibility than they had when exploiting the older vulnerability.
  
Good news:
  
One potentially mitigating factor is that a patch for CVE-2022-37958 has been available for three months. EternalBlue, by contrast, was initially exploited by the NSA as a zero-day.

 Hundreds of iOS Exchange ActiveSync entries. I did the steps to allow iOS 15.6 to auto-update months ago. I assume these are old devices that can&#x27;t get to 15.6, but at least two are IT users who are on updated devices.

 Successful sign-ins for users whom I blocked the specific protocol in the Admin center last week. How can they still be signing in with a blocked protocol?
